As the reputed black sheep of the Nintendo console family, one might think 1995’s Virtual Boy to be the last piece of hardware capable of garnering an enthusiast following today. Discontinued after less than a year on the market and never released in Europe, the elusive red-and-black headset is remembered as a headache-inducing, seemingly epic misfire from legendary Game Boy creator Gunpei Yokoi.
Nonetheless, a small but passionate community of engineers and developers is working to keep the Virtual Boy alive nearly three decades on from its premature and unfortunate demise. Their wares, which include high-quality after-market hardware and commercially successful small-batch physical copies of newly developed games, are a sign of sustained interest in the system.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If someone were to write the history of internet video, I think they'd need to mention Killer Bean. Released in 1996, just a year after Toy Story, it was a two-minute, 3D animated short about gun-toting beans, and almost entirely the work of one person. A slightly longer and much improved sequel, Killer Bean 2: The Party, was released in 2000.

Now it's getting a video game from original creator Jeff Lew, and it's an open world, first- and third-person roguelike shooter with the same acrobatic, John Woo-inspired combat as the nearly thirty-year-old animations. There's a first trailer below.

If you know your Sega history, then you most likely know — and love — the maraca-shaking monkey Amigo. Samba de Amigo was a cult hit on the Dreamcast back in 1999, and this little monkey rattled his way into many a heart over the years.
Laced with catchy Latin American music, pop songs, and a pair of maraca-shaped controllers, Samba de Amigo became a cult hit for its arcade-style gameplay and fun aesthetic.

It's Saturday and you know what that means. That's right, it's time for a spot of the ol' gaming.
There have been a good number of highlights at Nintendo Life this week. We got a large helping of Splatoon 3 news as we received a first look at the upcoming Drizzle Season and new Deep Cut amiibo — we're still in love with Big Man. We also finally got a release date for the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge DLC (it's later this month!) and heard when the Batman Arkham Trilogy will be swooping onto Switch.

Remember Mega Man X DiVE for mobile devices? Well, Capcom recently announced it would be getting an "offline" version and it's now been locked in for 31st August release date on PC and mobile devices. The online version of the game will also end its service at the same time.
Unfortunately, there's no mention of this action-platformer coming to Switch, but if we hear any updates, we'll let you know. What's interesting about this is there was actually a datamine of the game's client in 2021, which uncovered "a series of strings" directly referencing Nintendo's hybrid system.

It was Sega at their best. The Genesis had some identity issues, and the Saturn compounded on them, but the Dreamcast presented a confident and focused Sega as they plunged toward the spot on the ground where they were about to leave a crater.
Like many people, I skipped out on the Dreamcast during its initial run, but I’ve been making up for it ever since. However, I never got around to Space Channel 5, one of the more unique experiments that came out for the system in 1999.
So, why now? I’ve been watching GameCenter CX again, and there’s an episode where Arino makes an attempt at it, and he’s just so bad. Completely awful. I wanted…]]></summary>

Leaving a game unlocalized wasn’t very common in the early days when there was less text in games. Mostly we missed out on games like Famicom Detective Club and Fire Emblem, both titles that eventually received translations and re-releases. Mainly, the number of unlocalized titles bloated out in the early 3D era, then retracted again once we hit HD and the world became better connected through the internet.
However, there are still a number of titles that Nintendo has yet to localize, and I would like to bring them to your attention. Maybe we just need to make a bit of noise, and we’ll finally get to see …]]></summary>

First up, we talk with Katie Chrzanowski, who you may know as the social media manager for the Sonic the Hedgehog brand. However, she's also the producer of the Sonic Symphony, which was livestreamed in 2021 and is heading up the world tour happening this fall. Then, Brian is joined by Tee Lopes, composer of Sonic Mania and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge. He also happens to be the composer for the upcoming Sonic Superstars.

The upcoming 2D platformer brings Sonic The Hedgehog, Tails, Knuckles, and Amy back for a new cooperative adventure — however, I'd like to note we only engaged with the single-player experience. After our several-hour hands-on play session, we sat in my hotel room to break down our time playing six of Superstars' 12 zones, including details about each level, boss fights, the signature Emerald Powers, and how the platforming physics behaved.

Most years, the big "State of the Game" blogs used to signal big batches of positive changes coming to the game with the next paid DLC. This did not happen this time around. Instead, the community raised pitchforks after Bungie clarified that, no, there wasn't a big PvP content drop on the horizon. And no, there was no yearly ritual armor refresh because the team was too busy working on microtransaction armor.
The release of 2023's Lightfall DLC already soured things for a non-insignificant number of players. The game became more expensive to play on top of failing to reach the heights of 2022's Witch Queen expansion.

I'm playing Edders Sheeran in Baldur's Gate 3, a bard with a Dark Urge to lash out and murder largely anything and everything. He doesn't know what causes it, and he doesn't know when the urge might strike. For a first playthrough, it's been a learning experience. Namely, I have learned that friends aren't safe, lest I puncture their guts with my bare fists in the middle of the night.
I thought the urge would only bring downsides (what you'd normally get as a murderer), but I've also learned that it actually has benefits? You get capes in exchange for pulping people! I love capes! Here's to more of them.

We have just a few months to go before the NBA tips off in October and the teams are beginning to reveal their schedules for the 2023-24 season. Normally, this news is nothing to do with Nintendo — it's just a bunch of sports teams posting images of their filled-in calendars — but the Chicago Bulls have caught our attention this year with their Pokémon-inspired announcement.
Instead of simply revealing the team's upcoming dates, the Bulls have published their schedule in the style of Pokémon Red and Blue (check it out above). There's no calendar in sight as Benny the Bull (the team mascot) rides a bike around a pixel art Chicago, visiting gyms and challenging any trainers that he comes across. These opponents are other familiar faces from around the league, with Benny & co. facing off against the likes of Victor Wembanyama, Nikola Jokic and Lebron James, all in the style of a classic Pokémon battle.

Few could have predicted just how successful Nintendo's hybrid console would be prior to launch back in March 2017. For the preceding decade or so, many prolific third-party publishers tended to overlook Nintendo's systems for a variety of reasons, but Switch has attracted a huge number of the world's premier developers back to Nintendo hardware, some for the first time in a long time.

I've been in this glorious job for a whole two weeks now, and alas it is time to say goodbye... because I'm off on holiday. Genius-level journostrategist that I am, I managed to book a week away walking in Scotland during Gamescom before landing the gig, and I can't rebook without incurring the everlasting hatred of Caledonian Sleeper. I do have a few under-embargo stories and a review going live next week, but beyond that I'll be up a mountain somewhere until 29th August. Apologies - if you're up that neck of the woods and we happen to sight each other on opposing hillsides, I'll try to bellow something about Starfield.


Before I go, though, I wanted to check in about this whole "news" concept that's doing the rounds. The past two weeks have essentially been an exercise in tentatively pressing buttons and apologising to Katharine when half the website backend catches fire. I've tried to put together a fun mixture of stories - I particularly enjoyed the chat below yesterday's musings about pacifism - but I've mostly been settling in, and dealing with such evergreen journamalism questions as whether companies are singular or plural, and what proportion of any given article should consist of begging Blackbird Interactive to reveal something else about Homeworld 3.

I'm a huge fan of Path of Exile, but I know it can be very hard to get into. Even back when I started playing years ago, the learning curve was a bit much. On top of that, every season adds more mechanics and features. This is great for veteran players, but for those looking to try to learn the game, it only adds to the hassle. A lot of prospective players figured they'd wait until Path of Exile 2 to try relearning the game. However, now that we know it won't be entering beta for al…]]></summary>

It's been 7 years since Hello Games' No Man's Sky first launched back in 2016 for the PlayStation 4. Can you believe it?
Despite the mixed reception at launch, the first-person space exploration title received a number of updates and expansions over the ensuing years, substantially improving No Man's Sky's reputation amongst fans. Finally, in October 2022, the game launched on the Nintendo Switch, and it was a pretty darn good port, too.

Developer Worm Club has today announced that the beloved Frog Detective series is coming to Switch in one neat package as Frog Detective: The Entire Mystery scoots over to the Nintendo console later this year.
If you have never come across Frog Detective before, it's exactly what you might expect. You play as a detective (who is a frog) and solve a series of animal-based mysteries. It's cute and hilarious and exactly what you would want to see from a game with a title like that.

You would be forgiven for thinking that Nihon Falcom's action RPG Popful Mail was a series. In fact, the game underwent so many reimaginings following its release on the PC-8801 in 1991 that you might find a drastically different experience playing it on one console compared to another.
These differences range from additional music and levels to complete graphical overhauls, though perhaps the most interesting change is one that was only ever planned and never saw the light of day: the game was to become part of the Sonic series in its Mega CD form.

The mod in question, "AI Powered GTA V: Story Mode with AI NPCs" sees you investigating a cult of weirdo AI worshippers, with characters who speak AI-generated dialogue. It's now been struck from several sites by GTA 5 publisher Take-Two Interactive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For a few dollars more.
Cast your tired minds all the way back through the mists of time to the year 2010. It was a truly great 12 months for video games, with the likes of Super Mario Galaxy 2, the best Mass Effect – AKA Mass Effect 2 – and the juggernaut that is Xenoblade Chronicles all arriving on the scene. It was also the year that David Cameron was appointed Prime Minister of the UK, but we’ll…eh…let’s not think about that just now.
As highly anticipated and ultimately well-received as these amazing games were, they still stood somewhat in the shadow of the year’s biggest release, the all-conquering behemoth that was Red Dead Redemption. Rockstar Games’ epic Western was a real tour de force, a surprisingly serious, studied, and actually rather emotional rumination on the final days of the American frontier, which also had plenty of toilet humour and knockabout ragdoll violence, of course. It remains one of the highest-ranked games of all time on Metacritic and was heralded as Rockstar’s best work to date by many critics at the time. Now that’s really saying something.

Though GLaDOS rightfully tops the list another, introduced in 2011's sequel spectacular Portal 2, became an instant favourite. Voiced by J.K. Simmons, doing a turn adjacent to his J. J. Jameson from Spider-Man, Cave Johnson is the founder of Aperture Science (which used to primarily make shower curtains before it evolved into being a death trap puzzle company), and he made an instant impression. And though Aperture Desk Job is nominally a tech demo for the Steam Deck, it also expands the Cave Johnson lore in a very satisfying way. Spoilers beyond for Aperture Desk Job, and Portal 2 if you haven't played it.

We've already had one that makes Baldur's Gate 3 a single character RPG, which I am hoping somebody at the RPS Treehouse will do a diary feature about, plus a Painterly Scenery filter created by 1wk, which makes the game look like it's daubed on canvas. But the cluster of mods that caught my eye this morning are a simple change of camera perspective and controls that make the game look strikingly like Bioware's Dragon Age: Origins.

Publisher Dear Villagers has released a playable demo for its upcoming Paper Mario-inspired RPG Born of Bread, and it's available to download right now on the European eShop (so if you're in another region, get yourself an additional European account).
The game currently doesn't have a release date, so it's actually quite refreshing to be able to play a sample of something that, for now at least, might still be quite a way off. You play as a 'Flour Golem' who must team up with a colourful cast of characters and use his eclectic range of abilities to succeed in combat. Attacks require specific button prompts in order to maximise damage, and of course, knowledge of what your enemies are weak against will also give you a much-needed edge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The season is about to change, and with it, we have some changes to Symphony of War: The Nephilim Saga. The game's upcoming Legends DLC will launch in time to join the fall playlist, which Freedom Games has showcased in a new trailer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSb8BhMJutY
Developer Dancing Dragon Games (Skyborn, Echoes of Aetheria) first entered the battlefield with Symphony of War in June 2022. The title takes inspiration from series like Fire Emblem and Ogre Battle, which has resonated with retro strategy-RPG fans. The Legends DLC was revealed during the 2023 Guerrilla Collective showcase, just shy of the game's one year anniversary. This update promises to deliver eight new chapters for the main story, 13 new unit classes, new characters, and additional game modes like the always-welcome New Game+.
[caption id="attachment_397235" align="alignnone" width="640"] Screenshot via Dancing Dragon Games[/caption]
Class act
Symphony of War moves beyond focusing on specific troops to building up larger squads of up to nine units, eventually giving players command of a full army. The main heroes come into play when it's time to lead those squads into the turn-based battles throughout the campaign. Familiar ground for strategy-RPG aficionados, no doubt.
Legends DLC plans to expand upon this these mechanics with a new army meta that introduces necromancy and the undead. If raising an army of your own sounds like too much hassle, maybe literally raising them from the dead would be a more, um, palatable option?
As for the aforementioned new chapters, the eight added to the lineup are concurrent with the existing main story. They'll focus on expanding plots and tying up loose ends instead of starting anew with fresh faces and factions. 
We'll get to see how it all expands for ourselves when Symphony of War: The Nephilim Saga goes live with its Legends DLC on August 28, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A real gunslinger.
Red Dead Redemption is out on the Switch eShop today — with a physical release coming later in the year. There's been controversy around the port's price point and concerns over the game's quality (given the state of the GTA Trilogy's launch...), so what is this port like?
We'll have a review of the Switch version of the game out soon here at Nintendo Life, but in the meantime, the venerable Felix over on our YouTube channel pulled a fast draw on the eShop and rode into the Wild West today to check out just how Rockstar's critically acclaimed Western runs on the console.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Quantum probably isn’t the first game that comes to mind when you think of the golden years of the arcade. The 1982 vector cabinet, designed by Betty Ryan, has maybe a less exciting concept than Asteroids or Centipede. In fact, the first time I played it was part of the Atari 50 collection.
Atari and Sneakybox’s Recharged line of titles aren’t leaving anything by the side of the road, however, as Quantum: Recharged is the newest release. Surprisingly, it’s low-key one of my favorites. I’ve never been a massive fan of score-chasing arcade titles, and that hasn’t changed with the Recharged games. I prefer games with a bit of progression to them, and there’s more of that in titles like Gravitar: Recharged. However, the simple and fast design of Quantum really sucked me in.

Whether it's actually worth the (checks notes) $50 Rockstar is charging for it is one thing: but at least it comes with the Undead Nightmare DLC, which is one of the silliest romps the studio has ever created.
In other Switch eShop news, Quake II was surprised-released, and we even reviewed it (on PC)! This classic still holds up, but if you want something newer, Bomb Rush Cyberfunk is out on August 18. Here's the gist of this extremely Jet Set Radio-looking game: "Red is a graffiti writer who lost his head and instead has an AI robohead.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GameMill Entertainment has lifted the lid off of Flu Games The Walking Dead: Destinies. And, uh, they probably should have waited until it cooked for a bit longer before showing it off.
Basing itself off the popular AMC adaptation of The Walking Dead comic book series, The Walking Dead: Destinies promises to be a narrative-focused game that lets you rewrite the events of seasons 1-4 with your actions. I guess a lot of stuff happened in those seasons. I don’t know, I didn’t watch the show. It sounds like if your favorite character died and you want them to stay alive, you might have the option to do so here.
https://youtu.be/ARpGTkOlufQ
I’m not saying the game looks terrible, but this trailer is absolutely awful. One of the first scenes has a pair of gun-toting dudes approach some sort of compound. They look out over the field, and there’s a bunch of watch towers that don’t have any textures. What’s funny is that the same watch tower model is shown later on in the trailer, but on that occasion, it has textures. There’s also compression all over the video that is so heavy that I had to double-check to make sure I didn’t have it set to 480p.
The game itself looks pretty rough. The graphics seem a couple of generations behind, which I don’t usually mind, but it’s not like the art style was adapted to make up for it. It just looks kind of gross. It could be good, it’s just this trailer certainly doesn’t make it look that way. They probably should have, uh… framed it better.
The Walking Dead: Destinies is coming to PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. There’s no release date, but they’re already saying it will be $49.99.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gamescom 2023 will be kicking off next week, featuring some of the biggest names in the industry. One such name is AMD, and the PC hardware giant could announce some new lines in its RDNA 3 range.
That's if a recent tweet from AMD's own Scott Herkelman is anything to go by. Herkelman says that Team Red will be in attendance at this year's Gamescom, bringing with it the company's "next major product announcements."
https://twitter.com/sherkelman/status/1691864001129443634
What this will be exactly we can't say. However, judging from the "s" in "announcements," it sounds like it's going to be more than one thing.
New graphics cards, surely?
Suffice it to say, we would assume that AMD will announce its next line of graphics cards in its latest 7000 series. A report from PC Gamer speculates that it could well be the leaked RX 7800 XT.
That may not be all. Some people commenting under Herkelman's tweet are holding out that AMD will announce FSR 3. For those who don't know, FSR (or FidelityFX Super Resolution) is the tech giant's own take on algorithmic graphical upscaling, similar to Nvidia's DLSS and Intel's Xe Super Sampling.
AMD seems to be trailing behind Nvidia at the moment. Its biggest rival has already released a number of products in its Ada Lovelace range. We've already seen the likes of the RTX 4090 right through to a 4060 from Team Green.
Conversely, there have pretty much only been two launches in AMD's RDNA 3 range: the RX 7900 (XT, XTX, and GRE variants) and the RX 7600. Now would the time for Team Red to start unveiling some more in order to keep up with Nvidia.

        <updated>2023-08-17T14:29:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like many people that near their eighteenth birthday, the Xbox 360 will soon lose support from its parent company. Today, an announcement on Xbox Wire revealed that the Xbox 360 store will be shutting down on July 29, 2024. This means you will no longer be able to purchase games or DLC on the console, and the Microsoft Movies & TV app will stop working altogether.
However, the post makes it clear that content bought beforehand will still be playable after the cutoff date, so digital games on the 360 should still work just fine, and you'll always be able to re-download them. Games with online multiplayer features will also still be functional, though that exists on more of a game-by-game basis. For example, the servers of many Halo games have already been shut down. And while the Microsoft Movies & TV app will no longer work on the 360, your content there transfers to anywhere else you have the app.
Additionally, backwards compatible 360 games will still be available to purchase and play on the Xbox One and Series X/S. While this doesn't encompass every game on the 360 store, it does cover most of the platform's most popular titles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alan Wake 2 has been a long time coming, but fans will have to wait a little bit longer as the game has been pushed from October 17 to October 27.
In a press release, developer Remedy Entertainment doesn't cite a technical reason for the delay, only writing that “October is an amazing month for game launches, and we hope this date shift gives more space for everyone to enjoy their favorite games.”
This likely refers to the fact that Alan Wake 2 was originally going to release just three days before the arrival of heavy hitters Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 and Super Mario Bros. Wonder, which both launch on October 20. The new date now puts it a full week outside of that blast radius, providing some breathing room for players looking to enjoy some or all of those titles around launch. 
Alan Wake 2 unfolds 13 years after the original game and stars two protagonists: the titular author and FBI agent Saga Anderson. Saga is investigating a murder case in the Pacific Northwest, while Alan has been trapped in the nightmarish realm of The Dark Place since the first game's conclusion. Players switch between both characters and can play as much or as little of their stories as they see fit. Remedy has stated that the sequel is a pure survival horror title this time around. To learn more about the game, check out our preview of co-protagonist Saga Anderson’s gameplay chapter from Summer Game Fest. 
Alan Wake 2 will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via the Epic Games Store.]]></summary>

They do form a pleasant contrast, in fairness. Both are space games but one doesn't have a fishing mechanic, whereas the other is all fishing mechanic. One is about visiting strange new worlds, establishing outposts and shooting or romancing the heck out of the locals, while the other maroons you on a single asteroid. The Anglerfish Project deserves better than to serve only as a counterpoint for the Bethesda colossus, however - it's a sweet and tidy stargaze 'em up with a dry sense of humour, and you can download it for free on Itch.io.

Or, at least, that's what this particular CoD's marketing campaign would have you believe. With a huge new information drop slated to go live in very short order, fans of the franchise have already got a whole slew of things to be looking forward to, not the least of which is the return of the legendary Zombies mode.
Naturally, now's also the right time to remember that Modern Warfare 2 launched less than a year ago to reasonable critical acclaim, only for Activision to squander any launch-day goodwill over the course of the next couple of seasons.

Primarily, the exceedingly excellent Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew, but also Harebrained Scheme's upcoming turn-based tactics 'em up, The Lamplighters League, a game I've been quietly looking forward to ever since it was announced earlier this year.
Specifically, I've been playing through a handful of missions from the middle of The Lamplighters League's campaign, getting to grips with its full roster of agents and their unique set of skills. It continues to be just as stylish as the opening mission I played in May, but I'm not gonna lie. I've had quite a bit of whiplash coming straight from Shadow Gambit into this, but even if I'd arrived fresh and green, I don't think even all my years of tactics playing and XCOM-liker-liking would have been enough to prepare me for just how gosh darn difficult it is.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Get ready for liftoff. Starfield preloads begin Thursday as the game has just gone gold (which means Bethesda's development of Starfield is effectively complete!). Now, players can download the game pre-release on its platforms, but it will be truly ready to play when September 6 (or September 1 for early access players) rolls around. Unfortunately, Steam users will have to wait longer for Starfield preloads to take effect.
Those who own an Xbox Series X|S or a PC with the Xbox app can preload Starfield on August 17. Players on Steam have to wait much longer as preloading on that platform occurs on August 30. If you've bought the Premium Edition or Constellation Edition physically or digitally, you'll be able to gain access to Starfield five days early on September 1. To make the wait even more arduous, the Xbox Twitter page says its hand is moving "closer to [the] giant LAUNCH button."

After delays, Starfield is actually ready
Starfield was originally going to be released on November 11, 2022, but it was pushed back almost an entire year. “We know you’ve waited a long time to play something new from us," said director Todd Howard after announcing the September 6 release date in a trailer. "Believe it or not, we’re kind of the same."
He later said, "We really just can't wait for you all to play it." Now we're nearing that time. Many games from Bethesda's past were criticized for awkward facial animation and bugs across the board, but this new game engine may take Bethesda to the next level. It could lead to impressive showings for upcoming games like The Elder Scrolls VI. As of last year, that fantasy RPG is currently in a design stage of development.

Throughout the blighted lands in this sequel, you will find no shortage of denizens hoping to be redeemed. Condemned to often dark, grisly fates by the entity called the Miracle, these people graciously accept their punishments, hoping that their pain will absolve them of sin. Similarly, Blasphemous 2 strikes me as a game that wants to absolve itself from its predecessor’s shortcomings. I briefly played Blasphemous before taking on this review, but I honestly couldn’t get into it. I felt the combat was stiff, the platforming was aggravating, and the story absolutely did not grab me with its ornate, often vague prose.
On two of those counts, Blasphemous 2 marks an inspired improvement. In a world where even Mickey Mouse needs a Metroidvani…]]></summary>

If you think this a questionable affectation then guard thyselves, oh Penitent Ones, for you really are in store for an awful lot of this.  


Beyond that, Blasphemous 2 is a cracking Metroidvania rooted in satisfying combat and rewarding exploration of the ‘ooh, I didn’t realise this bit was connected to that bit’ vein. Neither element is on the same level of Dark Souls, but then what is?

Steeped in religious themes, the narrative of Blasphemous 2 tells of a land unable to overcome the curse placed on it by a higher power, regardless of how repentant its people are. Playing Blasphemous 2, I sometimes felt the same, as I wondered how I could possibly overcome the challenge before me. But like the denizens of The City of the Blessed Name, I persevered. And though the curses being thrown around my house each time I died were of a different variety than those cast in Blasphemous 2’s story, I loved nearly every minute o…]]></summary>

The file weighs in at 139.84 GB, so be sure to clear some disc space before you force this galaxy's worth of grey rocks, NASApunks and hopefully extensive Event Horizon comparisons into your protesting PC, which has only ever lived to serve you and bring you joy. Might be an idea to double-check those Starfield system specs, too, and make that final call on whether to invest in a new SSD.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stephen Kick, CEO of Nightdive Studios, has said he'd love to remaster Epic's 90s FPS Unreal. Not familiar with Nightdive? They're the team behind this May's triumphant System Shock remake, which Jeremy Peel described in his review as "a breathtakingly beautiful and astonishingly faithful remake that proves the enduring power of Looking Glass design". They're also the studio behind last week's surprise-released Quake 2 remaster, and a bunch of other classic 90s remasters including the PC version of DOOM 64 and Rise of the Triad: Ludicrous Edition. It's safe to say they know how to pull off a retro (sorry, Kamiya-san) comeback.

Druhou novinkou je podpora Geometry shaderů a transformací na macOS, díky čemuž opět poběží řada dosud nefunkční her (např. TEKKEN 7, Street Fighter V, MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries ad.) – s dodatkem, že nejlepší výsledky jsou při běhu přes wined3d (Wine implementace Direct3D) namísto obvyklého DXVK (mapujícího Direct3D na Vulkan).]]></summary>

He was proud of the game he and the team at Sabotage had made, but he was prepared to consider it a success even if it didn’t sell well. “If 100 People bought it, I would have been like, ‘Oh my God, we hit three digits. So, for sure, there’s at least one person I don’t know that bought it,’” Boulanger says. The Messenger sold far more than 100 copies and even took home The Game Awards’ Best Debut Indie award alongside many other accolades. With its unique approach to platforming and a fun story twist that allowed it to exist as both an NES and SNES throwback, The Messenger was a hit and quickly allowed Boulanger and Sabotage to pursue its dream project: A large-scale RPG unabashedly inspired by 16-bit greats like Chrono Trigger, Super Mario RPG, and many more. “It’s been seven years, and it’s still kind of a dream,” Boulanger says. Read more...]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Do you want to last longer in bed? Well, stop trying, because the new path to prestige is finishing as fast as possible. The bar has been set at 7 minutes, 54 seconds, as speedrunner Mae was able to charm the pants off of Lae'zel in that time. In Baldur’s Gate 3, I mean.
Mae had previously proven that Baldur’s Gate 3 can be completed in around 10 minutes, which is roughly how long I’ve spent in the entire game (that’s not a condemnation, I’ve just been busy with other things). But really, getting is the real goal of CRPGs like Baldur’s Gate 3. Saving the world is just something you do to meet potential partners.
https://youtu.be/C-Rkgdcj5Ds
The video is generally what you’d expect, but fascinating all the same. Mae uses a lot of the normal techniques used to speedrun the game’s opening. They then focus on freeing Lae'zel and getting on their good side. They then settle down in the romantic light of a campfire, sneak away into the night, and submit to their base urges. Hoo boy. I just love a partner with focus.
Frankly, 7:30 minutes of foreplay can be a bit disappointing. Hopefully, the after-glow and pillow talk aren’t part of the run. I wouldn’t recommend speedrunning intimacy with your partner unless you’re on break at the office or waiting on a bus. However, in this busy world we live in, aren’t we always aiming to be more efficient? We often try to minimize and abbreviate our pleasures so we can get back to what really matters: doomscrolling across the dying remains of social media.
Alright, so now we’ve seen the current Baldur’s Gate world record for copulation. Let’s see you do better. Or worse? I’m not sure anymore.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hold onto your warp nacelles and hyperdrives, Starfield aficionados. The game's lead designer Emil Pagliarulo and lead quest designer Will Shen have hosted a Discord Q&A about Bethesda's forthcoming space colossus. Self-despising fool that I am, I sat up late at the office taking notes throughout - please accept a modest avalanche of new details.


First off, a note on the subject of Starfield and housing. You can own property in "all the major cities in the game", according to Pagliarulo, with some dwellings being purchaseable and others, quest rewards.


Building on the character creation systems of Fallout 3 and Fallout 4, the game features a "Kids Stuff" trait that generates parents based on your choice of custom character, allowing you to inflict your terrible physiognomical experiments on at least two other in-game entities. "No spoilers, but I think fans will really appreciate the actors we got to play those roles," Pagliarulo added.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Step into your gi, Digital Eclipse has announced that their interactive documentary, The Making of Karateka, launches on August 29, 2023.
The Making of Karateka is more than just a new port of Jordan Mechner’s legendary 1984 Apple II brawler. It also promises video features, playable prototypes, and design documents providing an in-depth behind-the-scenes look at Mechner’s work. Digital Eclipse has even gone to the work of extrapolating on a prototype to provide it into a full-fledged game called Deathbounce: Rebounded. It’s a dual-stick shooter, which is a pretty great sub-genre.
https://youtu.be/IrS2pipZaH0
Digital Eclipse has last tested the interactive documentary concept with the Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration. It goes beyond the simple remaster format by going in-depth into the making of the games. Karateka is a great starting point, as Mechner made it years before the more renowned Prince of Persia. It’s a formative game known for its cinematics and rotoscoped animation.
I personally haven’t played Karateka. I’m pretty sure I have a copy of it for my Commodore 64 that I haven’t dug into yet, but I’ll probably just wait for this release to try it. After all, it’s out in just a couple of weeks. The Making of Karateka releases August 29, 2023 on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. The Switch version is lagging behind those versions, with a planned launch in September.

        <updated>2023-08-16T17:10:17.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood is many, magical things, but initially, at least, it is a card game in which you create your own cards. This takes the form of an MS Paint-esque editor in which you glue together a background, character assets and a collection of props, rotating, duplicating and altering the size of each asset with the mouse. Each asset soaks up a certain amount of arcane energy, divided between the four elements, which mean somewhat different things here than in the spell systems of other games. And each final design generates a different combination of meanings, some of them contradictory at a glance, all of them keys to the game’s weird, whimsical and sorrowful wider universe.
It seems an overly rudimentary system at first, though that’s coming from the perspective of somebody who’s reasonably familiar with Tarot, one of the game’s chief influences, and partial to devising their own crummy decks of visual poetry cards. In particular, I grumped to myself about the limits on shrinking and enlarging: I wanted to fashion more abstract, prog-rock designs with faces in pixellated close-up, whereas The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood sort of defaults to “dude holding thing against landscape” setups familiar from the Rider-Waite Tarot. While there are pieces you can plug in and leave out as you see fit, the system also insists that you include certain props from each batch, and I’ll admit to using the layer tool to hide unwanted skulls, floral wands and so forth behind other assets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge's big DLC Dimension Shellshock finally has a release date, as well as another new playable character. 
The expansion arrives on August 31 for $7.99, and a new trailer reveals that fan-favorite character Karai is joining the fun. Karai is a high-ranking member of the Foot Clan that made her TMNT comics debut in 1992 and has appeared in several animated adaptions. She’s usually depicted as Shredder’s second-in-command but has also been portrayed as his adopted daughter, depending on your choice of Turtles’ lore (perhaps most famously in the 2003 animated series). Despite her allegiance to the Foot, Karai has often been an uneasy ally to the Turtles in the face of mutual threats.


Dimension Shellshock also features Usagi Yojimbo as the other new playable fighter and will include a new survival mode. Today’s trailer shows off some of the new filters, including a neat black-and-white comic-panel style presentation inspired by the original TMNT books. The DLC also features new music from composer Tee Lopes and alternative color schemes for each character.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first game in the Opus series of visual novels (not to be confused with alchemy-themed puzzle machine game Opus Magnum), The Day We Found Earth, begins 14,000 years in the future, on a starship far from our familiar home planet. The humans in this far-flung future don’t even remember their ancestral home - it’s just a rumour, a fantasy. Yet that rumour is driving scientist Lisa, as it may be all that humanity has left. Players control a robot, Emeth, trained by the humans Lisa and Makoto to ‘find’ Earth, in the hope that reconnecting with the past will solve the issues facing humanity in the present.


Opus may lean into the sci-fi aspects with its visuals and setting, but The Day We Found Earth and its sequels, 2018's Rocket Of Whispers and 2021's Echo Of Starsong (which Katharine absolutely loved), are ultimately story-driven games with a human core far warmer than the coldness of space. Sigono announced a new entry, Opus: Prism Peak, earlier this year. "They’re narrative adventure titles that have heartfelt stories that always touch on themes of love and self-fulfilment," is what studio co-founder Scott Chen emphasises to me, as we start our conversation on the hectic floor of Bitsummit, Japan’s largest indie games event.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DreadXP has announced that developer LUAL Games’ text adventure [I] Doesn’t Exist will launch on PC September 9, 2023.
Described as “Classic Zork meets existential crisis,” [I] Doesn’t Exist has you awaken in an unfamiliar forest and has you use your noodle to try and escape. However, things promise to not be as they seem, which is great because they already seem weird and unsettling.
Like many text adventures of the early PC days, [I] Doesn’t Exist doesn’t just provide you with walls of descriptive text. It also uses graphics to depict its strange world. Beyond that, there are animations, so you don’t have to rely on your unreliable imagination to paint you a picture.
https://youtu.be/91PdAe-n5VA
[I] Doesn’t Exist also touts the use of "Natural Language Processing" to support its parser and make things more intuitive. While this means the use of AI, the developer is quick to clarify that it isn’t involved in the creation process and is just to make the language parser more natural. In their words:
"Publisher DreadXP and developer LUAL value the authenticity of human-made narratives, and none of the in-game text in [I] doesn’t exist is AI-generated. The Natural Language Processing technology utilized in the game is not affiliated with ChatGPT or other similar AI platforms and utilizes only the player’s input to access pre-written responses by the game’s super-cool writers."
That’s rather comforting because we all know how well it went when Square Enix tried to make a text adventure using AI.
[I] Doesn’t Exist launches on PC on September 9, 2023. A demo is available to try out right now.

If you head over to Nexus Mods, you'll see that the site has now opened up its modding section for the game. Obviously, there's nothing there yet (save for some artwork), but it's pretty obvious, given the amount of Elder Scrolls and Fallout mods that are forever coming out, that a lot of people are going to be tweaking Starfield the picosecond it comes out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMOPoAq5vIA&t=658s&pp=ygUQc3RhcmZpZWxkIGRpcmVjdA%3D%3D
Just imagine the possibilities. There's no end to the potential when it comes to modifying AAA games, and Nexus is one of the most popular places to showcase such projects.
And the winner is...
On top of that, the modding website is also hosting a competition, with a chance to win a copy of Starfield and some other goodies. For example, they're giving away a TUF Radeon RX 7900 XT graphics card, a B650-Plus motherboard, some peripherals, and some merchandise.
If you want in on this, you just have to head to the competition page and follow the instructions. The event goes on until August 29, and winners will be selected at random and contacted by Nexus Mods.
It's difficult to unbridled the sheer hype for Starfield. Given that it's Bethesda's first new IP in 25 years, a lot of people are going to be curious about what Todd Howard and his team have been working on. Will it pay off? Only time will tell.

There is no shortage of games that claim Twin Peaks as a primary inspiration, but the legendary TV multimedia experience is yet to take the leap into a full game adaptation. And it's not out of a lack of interest in the medium from its creators. Twin Peaks writer and director David Lynch once started to work on a game that would continue the series called Woodcutters From Fiery Ships, and Mark Frost, Twin Peak's co-writer, met with the creators of Link's Awakening to give them a few ideas.
Then in 2019, both of them signed off on a Twin Peaks VR project, though it's more of a collection of interactive sets than a full game. Anything where you get to play as leads Dale Cooper or Laura Palmer, interact with other characters from the show, and work to solve any of it's…]]></summary>

I know there's a dungeon master, or DM, who directs proceedings behind a cardboard shield. I know you lob some dice to determine the outcomes of an adventure that's contained in the heads of everyone at the roundtable. And that's about it.
Baldur's Gate 3 is based on D&D's 5th edition and it's meant to honour its rules to the absolute tee. I'm sure it does! To be honest, though, I haven't exactly learned much about D&D by playing it. I don't even think of myself as playing D&D, instead I'm just playing an RPG whose complexity adds a nice mystery to proceedings.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jollypunch Games has announced that the high-flying, toy-robot basketball game, Robodunk, will release on Switch and PC on September 25th, 2023.
I previewed the demo of Robodunk on a distantly long-past Steam Next Fest (it was this past February). It’s an over-the-top basketball game in the vein of NBA Jam. Two robots face a team of two other robots in a match of ups. Beyond just scoring some hoops, your robots are equipped with weapons and can dunk from the edges of space. Also, everything is made of wood for some reason.
https://youtu.be/OP55pjjMSkI
There’s also a roguelite progression where you try to make it as far as you can across various rounds of b-ball. Once you’re inevitably smacked back down to Earth, you can upgrade your robots or hire new ones.
After I wrote my preview for Robodunk, the developer reached out to me to get me to extrapolate on my feedback. At the time, one of my biggest issues was that I felt there was a dearth of personality to the whole affair, despite how over-the-top everything was. He pointed out to me that there are apparently lore entries that get unlocked as you play. What!? In a basketball game? No wonder I didn’t see them. That’s the last place I’d expect to find them.
So, I’m eventually going to play the full version, and I’m definitely going to check out these lore articles that give context to the automated dunks happening in the foreground.
You can check out Robodunk and its lore on September 25th, 2023 on Switch and PC. There’s also a demo available to check out on Steam.

Given the months that have elapsed since then, fans have been finding new ways to entertain themselves in what many consider one of Capcom's best games.
One such example comes from YouTube user Xenoxygene (as spotted by PCGamesN), in which they challenge themselves to complete the game without firing a single bullet at an enemy.

The idea being to make it all the way to the end with a perfectly abysmal accuracy rating of 0%. However, as you can imagine, there were many tribulations to attempting such a thing in a game known for a lot of gunfire.

While the results have been hit or miss over the last few years, EA Sports aims to deliver myriad updates to NHL 24 to make it feel more authentic to the real-life game of hockey than ever before.
It all revolves around the Exhaust Engine, which is a system that dictates player performance based on stamina while rewarding players for attacking on offense. The new Goalie Fatigue system ensures the goalie isn't as effective on the first shot of a power play as he is on follow-up shots. Goalie fatigue levels increase or recover as play goals on, so if the puck is on the other end of the rink for long stretches, that gives the goalie a chance to c…]]></summary>

Baldur’s Gate 3 is a surprisingly human tale. That may sound strange to say about a game with space lizards and brain worms at its center, but behind the hags and psychic tadpoles, Baldur’s Gate 3 is about a group of very broken people trying to find their way in life and maybe save the world. Or turn it into a smoldering heap of agony and misery. It depends on how you feel that day. Whether you choose peace or something less savory, Baldur’s Gate 3’s intricate writing …]]></summary>

It turns out all those librarians in the 90s were right: using your imagination really is cool and fun! Indeed, our ability to conjure fiction from the ether is fundamental to the ongoing success of D&D. Making up stories with friends is very much a good time, and if you get to kill a goblin or two in the process? Well. That's just gravy.


Built upon the foundations of D&D's fifth edition ruleset, Baldur's Gate 3 attempts to translate the fundamentals of the game into digital form. But how successful is it at doing so? Can a video game - with all the rigidity that comes with the medium - replicate the freedom of a table-top role playing game?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gamescom is on the horizon and kicks off with Opening Night Live next week, the E3-style showcase of upcoming games hosted by Geoff Keighley. Today, Keighley revealed that the long-quiet Crimson Desert will make its presence known in the form of new gameplay footage.
Crimson Desert was first revealed at The Game Awards in 2020 and comes from Pearl Abyss, the studio behind the popular MMO Black Desert Online. Crimson Desert is a single-player open-world RPG set in the gritty medieval fantasy world of Pywel. This biodiverse continent is inhabited by humans, fantastical races, and mystical beasts and centers on Macduff, a mercenary who assembles a band of comrades to survive an ensuing power struggle of numerous factions vying to take control of the continent. 
Next Tuesday, join us at @gamescom Opening Night Live, to see a brand new look at the gameplay of CRIMSON DESERT (@CrimsonDesert_) from Pearl Abyss.

August 16, 2023
The game's presentation and tone have Western fantasy vibes reminiscent of series such as Game of Thrones. Combat consists of fast-paced melee combat (both unarmed and with various weapons) and flashy magic abilities. If you haven’t seen Crimson Desert in action, check out this gameplay overview released around the game’s announcement.


Crimson Desert doesn't have a release date, but Pearl Abyss CEO Jin-Young Heo stated earlier this year that the game was targeting a fall 2023 release window. We'll likely find out of that's still the case when Opening Night Live airs on August 22 at 11 a.m. Pacific/2 p.m. Eastern.]]></summary>

Following a troubled set of releases that came at a higher price than ever before in the history of Destiny, as well as a "disastrous" State of the Game blog post detailing what the developer has in store for the game in the coming months, it hasn't been a grand old time for the players.
Destiny 2 Game director Joe Blackburn has, therefore, taken to Twitter/X in an attempt to assuage the community to some extent. In a recent 15-minute video, Blackburn has taken some of the players' vocal critiques to heart, promising changes and compromises, as well as a renewed focus on PvP.

Jumplight Odyssey bases itself on ‘80s sci-fi anime and does it with such incredible pizzazz and with such elegant depth that I’m absolutely stunned by the result. It feels like a missing Macross game, a title that bases itself not around the war going on but on the survivors aboard the SDF-1 as they cling to hope in the direst of circumstances. It is an exciting development by the team behind Armello.
Now, if only I could play it without getting hindered by bugs.

After what felt like an eternity of Kinetic Games promising that a significant patch was coming, the team finally confirmed it on Discord recently. There's also been a public post on Twitter confirming that, yes, the "Ascension" update is inbound and will be going live on August 17 from 10AM UTC onwards.
https://twitter.com/KineticGame/status/1691407479119192065
If you want to get in those last few levels before Phasmophobia goes through these changes, now's the time.
Everything changes
Over a series of dev posts on Steam, we've learned that a lot of things are going to be different in Phasmo. For one, there's some new equipment, which is now going to be tiered. Everyone is also having their levels reset to 0, but it's been said that you will be given a badge that indicates where you were before the update. The patch was supposed to be rolling out a little earlier, but the people at Kinetic said they had to delay it a little bit.
Phasmophobia is also coming to consoles, with a projected release date of...well...sometime this month. Who knows, maybe we'll get the PS5 and Xbox Series versions on the same day as the big update.
In any case, there's a lot to look forward to. So horror fans, mark your calendars for tomorrow, the Progression 2.0 changes are coming!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Winding back the clock to rewrite past mistakes is a core stratagem of any Mimimi game. Baldur's Gate 3 might have rekindled the debate about save-scumming over in RPG circles, but in the stealth strategy arena where Mimimi operate, reaching for the F5 and F8 keys to quick load a previous save is as natural as swapping between your party members on 123, or activating their unique abilities to clobber all manner of unsuspecting guards on the back of the head with ASD and F.
In their latest real-time tactics-me-do Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew, however, the act of quick saving has been woven directly into the language of the game, presented not as cold, hard button commands, but as 'captured memories' that your magical ghost ship The Red Marley is able to unleash to make sure your supernatural pirate crew don't get caught or die (again) on the job.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With its full release on PC happening back in October 2022, Vampire Survivors has quickly become a runaway success. Already, there are imitators popping up trying to duplicate the game’s special sauce. As with many games that have spurred a sudden explosion of similar titles, it tantalizes developers with its simple but malleable gameplay.
I did play the PC version a few months back and was lucky enough to eventually claw my way from its grips. But with the Switch version dropping, I felt it was time to fall back into its embrace for the sake of the review. Hopefully, I can one day escape again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MiHoYo have released Genshin Impact 4.0's update, adding a new area, story elements, characters, domains and equipment to the gacha-driven free-to-play action RPG, which I remember having a lot of fun with last year. I've since inhaled a vast amount of shonen anime, and have accordingly been looking for a moment to reconnect with Genshin, one of the better anime games on the shop - perhaps this is it.


As Rebecca (RPS in peace, sob) wrote last week, Genshin Impact 4.0's big new feature is the the sunken kingdom of Fontaine, which you can dive into after completing prologue mission Act III and unlocking the associated teleport waypoint in Sumeru. That's literally dive into: Fontaine - not to be confused with the nice man from the Bronx you encounter in Bioshock - is water-themed, and there's a new mechanic, Fontaine's Blessing, which allows you to navigate local lakes, together with a Lucin Fountain system that can be levelled up for certain items.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Star Wars is no stranger to video game adaptation. In fact, depending on your age, video games may be the primary way you interact with the far away galaxy from a long time ago. Outlaws, however, represent something new for the franchise, even if it isn’t new to video games. We’ve shot from the first-person perspective in Battlefront, explored labyrinthine, Metroid-inspired levels in Respawn’s Jedi games, and even commanded armies in Empire at War, but Outlaws is the first time we will explore an open Star Wars world.
Following a panel on the game at Comic-Con, we spoke with Outlaws' narrative director, Navid Khavari, over e-mail about a number of topics related to the game, including potential overlap with Shadows of the Empire, what exactly protagonist Kay Vess is going after, the fate o…]]></summary>

Not only is the game a hit commercially and critically, but the development team is also addressing multiple pain points due to player feedback, which you always love to see. A patch was just released on PS5, and like most of the patches before it (on any platform), there's a lot to unpack. Here are the big takeaways.
Crashes and trophies are fixed
Trophy/Achievement bugs are some of the most annoying glitches out there, especially if they only impact one or two seemingly small tasks. It's not uncommon for AAA games to have a few bugged trophies, which can cause problems with the ever-present chase of Platinum status. Thankfully, this fix is retroactive, so your trophies should "ding" automati…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Forklift Interactive has launched Stage Games Inc’s production strategy game, Desynced, into Steam Early Access today.
Desynced is part automation game, part base-builder, and part RTS. You find yourself stranded on an unknown world and need to manufacture parts to repair your ship. You take command of a horde of drones that you use to extract resources and take them to various facilities to be processed. It bills itself as an “automation game without belts.” There’s a detailed system for programming your drones to work more autonomously, and you can also bring in other players for multiplayer.
https://youtu.be/SLVZlg7sp9E
Meanwhile, there is also an RTS aspect to Desynced, where you have to protect your factory. That seems like a worthwhile wrinkle to me since being able to diagnose and repair damage to your automated systems sounds pretty fantastic.
While the automated production genre has been seeing a lot of growth in the indie sphere over the last few years, I haven’t taken the dive yet. I’m not entirely sure why. For one thing, it’s a genre that can only really flourish outside of mainstream gaming, which is something I love. I also enjoy management games. I think I’m afraid of getting sucked in and finding myself having difficulty uncoupling when it comes time to play a game for work. That’s a pretty good problem to have.
Desynced is available for PC through Steam Early Access starting today. Stage Games is estimating that it will stay in Early Access for a year before reaching completion.

You gallop shrieking and blundering round a corner and are confronted by a series of ominous doors with labels such as "Baldur's Gate 3". You only have a few seconds to pick one and dive through, sweating in the knowledge that each door leads to a confusing network of corridors that exist wholly apart from each other - that each door not opened is a route to an Elsewhere you are doomed to never know, unless you're commissioned to do a, haha, "retrospective" 10 years later.
This summer, in my previous dishonourable capacity as a freelancer, I barged through the doors marked "Zelda" and "Final Fantasy 16", then spent a frantic moment trying to force the "Baldur's Gate 3" door, before giving up and throwing myself under a heap of unedited features. Now, in the relative lull before the monster named Starfield crashes through the ceiling (yes, I know, I'm mixing my scenarios - it's the end of the day and I'm tired), I emerge from the heap reborn as RPS News Editor, and peer back fearfully at some of the doors I left unopened. By far the grimmest and grandest of these is, of course, Diablo 4.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bungie is holding its annual Destiny 2 Showcase on August 22. The event will shed more light on The Final Shape expansion and other upcoming events.
The event airs at 9 a.m. Pacific/12 p.m. Eastern with an hour-long pre-show prior and a live post-show roundtable discussion. The Final Shape is a significant expansion for fans as it’s billed as the conclusion to the Light and Darkness Saga. That means everything that has occurred up to this point will culminate with this story. Speaking of which, Bungie released a new video recapping the biggest moments of the Destiny journey.


The showcase will also dive into Season 22, the next reprised raid, among other announcements. For more on Destiny 2, check out our review of its most recent expansion Lightfall, then read about how Keith David has been cast as the new voice of Commander Zavala.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paradox have posted a Cities: Skylines 2 developer diary in which the studio discusses the new game's rather elaborate-sounding economy simulation. This follows equally knotty breakdowns of its zoning tools, which allow you to mix architectural styles, and its road traffic system, which will hopefully dispense with some of the pathfinding issues from the original Cities: Skylines. In unravelling how individual agents - households, businesses or city services - function within the simulation, the post also touches on the topic of homelessness, a subject the 2014 game left unaddressed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are loads of good Steam Deck games – as in, games that happen to play well on a Steam Deck, even if they were originally crafted around desktop hardware and intended to be poked around with a mouse and keyboard. This is a joy of the portable PC in itself: that if you already have a populated Steam library, a box-fresh Deck will immediately have a selection of familiar favourites to install at no extra cost. 
Still. While the Steam Deck doesn’t do exclusives, it does have a killer app. Nearly a year and a half after Valve surprise-launched Aperture Desk Job alongside their handheld, the comedy tech demo remains unsurpassed as a playable introduction to the hardware. Again, there are thousands of compatible games, but if you’ve just recently grabbed a Steam Deck (perhaps via the new official refurb scheme), Aperture Desk Job could hardly be more perfect as an inaugural install.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have, for the past several weeks, been playing Baldur's Gate 3, the RPG equivalent of paying for ex-special forces lads to kidnap you at an unappointed day when you're walking your labradoodle, and put you through a rigorous (pretend) interrogation schedule. Will you learn something? Will it occupy your waking thoughts until it's over? Is the commitment of everyone involved assured? Yes. But would describe the experience as restful? Extremely debatable.
Hammerwatch 2 is out today, and it's kind of an isometric RPG that you can play in multiplayer, and which is at base kind of hacky-and-slashy, but has stacking complexity the more you play. It's like paying for ex-special forces lads to read a choose your own adventure book to you, but they get really into doing the voices. I feel comfortable describing the pixel art as "adorable", and it makes everything seem like it's a cute little miniature you can hold in your hand. Hence Mighty Max, which was a key part of my childhood. I don't want to say that Hammerwatch 2 is easy, because that isn't quite right and there's some jank lurking in there. But what it is, is easy to get a handle on. It has also functioned as a way of reintegrating my diseased Faerûined mind back into normal society.

I met this really nice bard in Baldur's Gate 3 called Alfira the other day. She was perched on a rock, swinging a sweet medley to a couple of squirrels. Being the bard Edders Sheeran, I wandered over and listened to her perform. She kept getting stuck on some verses, so I helped her fill in the blanks. Then things went Disney, as the camera pulled away and circled her as she performed a beautiful ballad, one dedicated to her late teacher. She seemed content, belting out the ballad. The squirrels, it turns out, thought her voice was awful.
Anyway, she took me by surprise much later on as I slew the last of some goblin leaders. She snuck into danger just to say she wanted to join our adventures; see the world! I, Edders Sheeran, was thankful to have such a ray of sunshine enter the camp. "Of course, we'd love to have you," I replied. What could possibly go wrong?

Style can't fix a bad game, but it can elevate a decent one about, say, a little hand-drawn 2D samurai running across the world stabbing dudes for peace. Little Jinmu does a lot of running to the right, a lot of slashing, and probably very little parrying and punching once you figure out the power attack.


There is, bluntly, not a lot to it, especially while its online mode is still listed as "coming soon". But even with remote multiplayer, I see this as more of a diversion for friends to enjoy than a serious competitive fighter and intentionally so.


I enjoyed it though. Actually, I think I enjoyed it more for that, though it does perhaps limit its audience.

This weekend I went to town and bought a copy of the Murdle book - or, I should say, Volume 1, because you can already pre-order Volume 2. It's a chunky enough tome made up of 100 of the puzzles that form Murdle's daily little treat, split into sections of escalating difficulty. And, against my expectations, and despite basically being a vehicle for logic grid puzzles, Murdle has an actual plot. Which is more than many video games manage.

You'd think, then, that a game about a nomadic Iron Age people larking about in a horrible swamp would be made for me, but unfortunately, Gord is somehow both a game where you can feed a child to a forest-dwelling horror, and a game that's kind of dull.
It's the only memorable thing that happened, and I did it to save time. The horrors are sort of demi-gods who you occasionally threaten you with plague unless you satisfy some demand. The alternative is to attack them, which the game stresses is extremely dangerous. I might rationalise the choice as the lesser evil, one life sacrificed to spare the lives of several, but the reality is that sending all those dudes back and forth across the map just sounded like too much hassle.

Proto se následující Cloud Native Prague meetup, který je již čtvrtý v pořadí, bude konat v Pražské Stromovce, konkrétně Grill bod 1. Nejedná se o klasický formát meetupu, jako dříve, ale jde spíše o neformální diskuzi mezi účastníky. Tématem jsou „screw-ups“, můžete tedy povědět to co se vám úplně nezdařilo a chcete o tom diskutovat s dalšími účastníky.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been itching to play The Lords Of The Fallen since I discovered that it's a closet Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver homage (see my bio), with a sorcerous lantern that lets you switch between the living and unliving worlds of Axiom and Umbral. Each realm has a different layout, architecture and ambience, and you'll need to alternate between them to expose routes and bypass obstacles, as indicated by clumps of ashen butterflies, making your way back to Axiom by means of an Effigy of Emergence.
You're also dropped into Umbral when you die, which gives you another chance to bump off whatever it is that slew you; die a second time, and you'll have to restart from one of the game's Vestige bonfires. Another thing to worry about: the longer you spend in Umbral, realm of death and despair, the more numerous the monsters that spawn from its shadows. I'm hoping the two-worlds mechanic will mutate the game's many debts to Dark Souls into a brand new playstyle (though as Ed Superior noted in his Lords of the Fallen hands-on, it stands up pretty well as a straight Souls clone). It already poses some fun possibilities for the ever-thorny question of multiplayer.

Here are some things I might do if I were locked in my boss's office (sorry Katharine): approve expense claims, sift their browser history for blackmail material and oh, who am I kidding, what I'd really do is perch on the desk, quiet as a churchmouse, waiting to be let out. Orbo's boss keeps an... atypical office, however. It harbours product portals that take you to alternate worlds, hewn from the same seam of weirdness as Psychonauts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bethesda have published a timeline detailing events in the Starfield universe from before the player's arrival. The scrollable chronology, which runs from 2050 to 2160, charts the origins of the war between the United Colonies and Freestar Collective factions, who sound more and more to me like the Union and the Confederacy in the US Civil War. We're also told about the formation of the Constellation organisation, a group of swashbuckling pioneers who are concerned with the origins of certain mystic Artifacts. And we get to read a little about a few key Starfield characters, such as space cowboy Sam Coe, careworn ex-soldier Sarah Morgan and sciencehunk Barrett. But the timeline also leaves plenty of mysteries. Join me, as I make a show of poking around in the collapsing space-museum with my tricorder.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[IO Interactive have found such success with Hitman over the past decade that it's hard to imagine the developer making anything else, but I have many vivid memories of its non-Agent-47-centric outings. 2010's Kane & Lynch 2 was a very special breed of spiritual ugliness, while 2003's Freedom Fighters wowed youngling me with its chunky urban squad tactics. I also have a soft spot for Mini Ninjas, one of IO's few jaunts into the realm of family-friendliness, if only because as somebody familiar with IO's other work, I could smell the blood beneath its bloodless Nickleodeon visuals.
I'm keen to hear more of the studio's forthcoming James Bond adaptation, unveiled in 2020 - surely a marriage made in franchising heaven, though I struggle to imagine an IO protagonist quipping like 007. But I'm especially eager to lay eyes on its currently untitled Project Fantasy, an online RPG inspired by "the togetherness, camaraderie, agony, and delight" of table-top gaming and more specifically, Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone's Fighting Fantasy books.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin's Creed Mirage is one of the most anticipated games of 2023, and after years of rumors and delays, its release date is still just out of reach. However, that wait has been shortened just a little; today, Ubisoft revealed that the game has gone gold, and since they're done ahead of schedule, it will now come out on October 5th, a week earlier than previously announced.

The game follows Basim Ibn Ishaq, an Assassin previously introduced as a supporting character in 2020's Assassin's Creed Valhalla. While the series was traditionally about stealth-focused combat in dense cities, more recent entries have put the player into more open-world environments and incorporated RPG mechanics. Mirage is a return to that classic formula of old, complete with the iconic white hood, hidden blade, and parkour. Set in Baghdad, the game takes place 12 years before the events in Valhalla.
In an era where it feels like games are constantly being delayed, it's a nice change of pace when a game is moved up instead. Recently, Baldur's Gate 3 moved its PC release up to avoid competing with "other RPGs," which most likely refers to Starfield. Mirage's new date doesn't seem to be motivated by the desire to avoid competition, but it does pull it a little ahead of the other huge games releasing in October, specifically Marvel's Spider-Man 2 and Super Mario Bros. Wonder, which both come out on October 20.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you can believe it, we first wrote about Small Saga, the retro-flavoured turn-based RPG filled with penknife-wielding rodents and fireballs cast from cigarette lighters, a little over four years ago. Clearly inspired by the likes of Final Fantasy - albeit crossed with the ‘small animals on a big adventure’ feel of Brian Jacques' Redwall novels - it looked absolutely brilliant. That sentiment was only solidified by its Steam Next Fest demo last year, which left Katharine impressed by its compelling combat and rodent fantasy setting. It’s been quite the journey for the indie RPG, but we won’t have to wait much longer to see what Small Saga has to offer in full, as it finally has a release date.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For all the big-budget GeForce graphics cards, it’s the firmly mainstream XX60 models that must surely keep the lights on at Nvidia HQ. A glimpse at the current Steam hardware survey reveals that the RTX 3060, RTX 2060, and GTX 1060 are all within the top four most-used GPUs – with the RTX 3060’s laptop version at number five. These are important cards, and messing up the next one would be a disaster.
The RTX 4060 is not a disaster. Ultimately, it a very capable 1080p graphics card, a technical upgrade on the RTX 3060, and (unlike several other RTX 40 series GPUs) arrives at a reasonable price. But it probably doesn’t deserve the apparent immortality of its predecessors, with only modest gen-on-gen performance gains and a heavy reliance on DLSS (including DLSS 3) to expand that difference.

Through a new trailer that premiered at the Pokémon World Championships last weekend, we've learned that The Indigo Disk, part two of the DLC, will have returning favorites, brand-new moves, and a mysterious nineteenth Tera Type.


Right off the bat, the trailer starts with an exciting reveal: every past first partner Pokémon (known more commonly as "starters") will be returning in the Winter expansion. In most games in the series, starters can only be obtained at the very start of the game, and you can only ever obtain one of three. They're also typically exclusive to every region, so partner Pokémon from Gold…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the picturesque Regency town of Leamington Spa, a debutante has entered the local high society of AAA game developers. Named Maverick Games, it’s led by the former director of Forza Horizon 5 - a creative risk-taker named Mike Brown. “Games are made in a very certain way that brings with it real security,” Brown told GamesIndustry.biz in January. “We know that if we do these things in a row, we will hit this date and the game will come out. I think there are other ways where you can still hit that date, but also do a load of new things on the way.”


One of the new things Maverick is backing is Jamie Brittain, lead writer on the studio’s unannounced open world game. Brittain has never worked on a videogame before. Yet any millennial who grew up in the UK will undoubtedly be familiar with Skins, the epochal teen drama he co-created with his dad, Bryan Elsley.

If you're new to the much-imitated Vampire Survivors format, the idea is to steer an auto-attacking character around a map that is slowly invaded by increasingly hazardous waves of foes, levelling up as you go. Think of it as a bullet hell shooter, but set to the tune of a walking sim. At first, anyway: at higher levels, Vampire Survivors is a perfectly withering experience, for all its initial glacial pace.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Game designer, sometime Gears of War frontman and nowadays, comic book author Cliff Bleszinski would very much like Epic to make another Jazz Jackrabbit. In case you're unfamiliar, or disgracefully young, Jazz Jackrabbit was a platform game for MS-DOS, published in 1994 - it was Bleszinski's first project as a designer for then-named Epic MegaGames. He worked on the game alongside coder Arjan Brussee, who would later found Guerrilla Games before moving to Visceral Studios and finally, reuniting with Bleszinski to launch Bosskey Productions, the ill-fated creator of the generally rather decent Lawbreakers. Cor, people don't half move around in this industry.
I never played Jazz Jackrabbit - if memory serves, the first in the series launched during a particularly cursed/blessed (delete as appropriate) part of my early youth, when my gaming consisted exclusively of shareware titles on Apple Macintosh. But I can certainly get behind Bleszinski's follow-up remark that he'd like a potential Jazz Jackrabbit 3 to be a first-person game in the vein of PS1 classic Jumping Flash.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Little-CRPG-that-could Baldur's Gate 3 has solved the Labyrinth, outwitted the Sphinx and ascended to the rank of Metacritic's highest-rated PC game of all time, knocking ZA/UM's Disco Elysium into second place. (OK, so technically they're both on 97, but I'm guessing the "score distillation" arithmetic behind-the-scenes puts Baldur's Gate 3 ahead - their positions were reversed last time I checked.) This follows a busy weekend for Larian's new game, which exceeded its own online player activity record on Sunday to the tune of around 875,000 players.


It's a terrific achievement for one of the richest and most rewarding D&D adaptations ever set to code. It's also only going to encourage those on the interwebs who are using Baldur's Gate 3's success as a stick to beat other developers with. As you've likely discovered for yourself, the new game is the centre of a raging discussion about what we should expect from today's "triple-A games", aka "biggest/shiniest". Some point to its lack of microtransactions or DRM, while others highlight its relative technical sturdiness and overall "quality". A few people go into specifics: I've read a couple of thoughtful comments comparing the bespoke, one-and-done nature of Baldur's Gate 3 quests with open world action titles and other genres that hinge on repeated quest formulas and reward systems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To The Core is, to borrow its Steam description, "an incremental game about extracting and using resources from planets to buy upgrades." That's pretty much it. I've played it for eight hours since buying it yesterday, hooked by a progression curve that takes you from an ineffectual mining ship chipping at a single planet's rocky surface until you explode, to the leader of a swarm of bomb-dropping drones and aerial bombardment lasers that can travel a solar system and devour any planet to its core in seconds.

It's part idle game, part Vampire Survivors, and it's out now.

And by "the real world" I mean "other video games". Although not many, admittedly. BG3 is very big. I think I'll be the first to break free from its metaphorical chains because I played it for review, but I'm still puttering about trying to take the roads I un-taked the first time. Still, we've got time for some Apelegs and some little demos and some seeeeecrets and whatnot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During today's THQ Nordic Digital Showcase, we learned about a new game starring everyone's favorite raunchy Colorado kids. South Park: Snow Day looks to carry on the series' legacy of over-the-top and mature-rated humor while still viewing life through the eyes of children. 
Starring the core group of Cartman, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny, players take part in celebrations surrounding the magical occasion of a snow day. Four players can join together in this co-op title on a quest to save the world during a day without school. You can see the teaser trailer for this game below.


We don't have many more details surrounding the title, but the game is in development by Question Games, a  studio based in California and Virginia. In the past, the studio has worked on The Blackout Club and The Magic Circle. South Park: Snow Day! is set to arrive on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC in 2024.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year, Paramount teased that a video game based on the popular Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles graphic novel, The Last Ronin, was in development. While we haven't heard much since then, today's THQ Nordic Digital Showcase gave us a teaser trailer. Unfortunately, we did not get any looks at gameplay or additional information.
In the Last Ronin graphic novel storyline, the final surviving member of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is on a quest for revenge in a ruined New York City. Both the trailer and the new synopsis point toward this being the case for the game as well. "Who is the Last Ronin? In a future, battle-ravaged New York City, a lone surviving Turtle embarks on a seemingly hopeless mission seeking justice for the family he lost. From the minds of the creators of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and based on the best-selling comic book event by Eastman, Waltz, Bishop, Delgado, and the Escorza Brothers: the official video game adaptation of TMNT: The Last Ronin."


According to senior vice president for games and emerging media at Paramount Global in his interview with Polygon back in March, TMNT: The Last Ronin will be a single-player action RPG similar to the modern God of War series. The title will feature a mature tone, which should be exciting for fans of the comic series, but Rosen made it clear back in March that the game was years away from release.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Last Ronin doesn't currently have a release window, but is currently slated to come to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. For more on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in gaming, be sure to check out our review of TMNT: Shredder's Revenge and our in-depth impressions of TMNT: The Cowabunga Collection.]]></summary>

Freshly announced at tonight's THQ Nordic Showcase, I've been playing an early, hour-long demo build of it this week, and while there are certainly things to admire here, I'm not overly convinced it's going to be one for the ages. Its colourful visuals and contrasting colour palette cast its deep caverns and sun-drenched mountains in a beautiful, but eerie kind of light, and its strange, scuttling creatures put me in the mind of the night horrors from Dredge and Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet. But its central premise of you being a headless body carting round an inflatable head to presumably escape to goodness knows where isn't quite the breath of fresh air I hoped it would be.

You don't have long to give it a pop - it will disappear on August 28th - but this base-building RTS harks back to the C&C days of yore with its diverse set of units and industrial metal soundtrack. I played a version of this demo earlier in the year and had a great time with it, so it's worth seeking out over the weekend if you get a spare moment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[THQ Nordic and Appeal Studios have semi-re-announced Outcast 2: A New Beginning as plain old Outcast: A New Beginning, having sensibly decided that positioning it as a sequel to a 24-year-old game might turn younger audiences away. In a pre-reveal showcase attended by RPS, producer Andreas Schmiedecker walked us through a few sections of this atypically green-fingered open world shooter.
In Outcast: ANB you play a growly-gruff ex-Navy SEAL, the sleekly named Cutter Slade, who roves a planet called Adelpha using a fancy jetpack. You're here to help the indigenous Talans - who definitely hail from the Ewoky end of the ethnic representation scale - fight off an army of robot invaders. The jetpack is the initial star attraction: it lets you boost, glide and dash through colourful landscapes inspired by 80s and 90s movies and comics. The associated animations seem a bit wooden to me: I often felt like I was watching somebody steer a man-shaped cursor, rather than a body in flight. But I certainly can't argue with the verticality and agility on display.

It sees you hunting down Nemesis, goddess of retribution, who has gone a bit do-lally and is meddling with the Threads of Fate.

The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will we land on it? Let's find out. Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey.

Specifically, pastures that have had the letters and numbers VG247 mown into them, as Rebecca is beginning a new guides journey at our dear sister site starting next week. We wish her all the best in her new adventures, follicking in the fields of Animal Crossing and other console-based delights, although I'll personally be very sad to lose my fellow Zero Escape and Danganronpa liker (the placement of these games in next year's RPS 100 is now in serious trouble, folks, I'm telling ya now). But before we get too deep in the doom and gloom, come and bid her farewell in the comments below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baldur’s Gate 3 is off to a pretty great start in terms of its, thus far, glowing reception and player engagement. Developer Larian Studios has released a fun infographic accumulating player data gathered from the game’s first weekend, and the results are a mix of surprising, amusing, and flat-out staggering.
Last weekend, you played 1225 years of Baldur’s Gate 3. As we head into the second weekend of launch, we’ve compiled some tasty stats for you to sink your teeth into.

August 11, 2023
You can view the fun infographic in the embedded tweet above, but we’ve summarized each bullet point below:
368 players finished the game during the opening weekend.
Over 93% of players rolled a custom character
Players spent a combined 88 years in character creation
Nearly 10% of characters spent at least one hour in character creation
Gale was the most popular Origin character selected at 27,784 players
Gale was the 7th cause of death for players
Paladin was the most popular class choice at over 200K players
Half-Elf was the most popular race choice at over 250K players (barely edging out Human at 2nd and Elf at 3rd)
Almost 100,000 players have been rejected by Astarion (Shadowheart was the most popular romance option, followed by Gale)
One NPC was shoved into a chasm for every concurrent player during peak engagement on Sunday (815,000 players)
12% of player deaths were caused by friendly fire
65.1% of players saved Emerald Grove
Scratch has been petted over 750,000 times
Players spoke to over 1,400,000 corpses and over 2,400,000 animals
Players have played at least 10,000,000 hours (over 1,225 years)
Needless to say, a lot of players appear to be having a great time with Baldur's Gate 3, and we look forward to seeing how these stats evolve over time, especially once the PlayStation 5 version launches next month. Stay tuned to Game Informer for our impending review of Baldur's Gate 3 and let us know what you think of the game in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rangers aren't everyone's favourite Dungeons & Dragons class, especially in the current 5th Edition ruleset, which is the one that smash hit RPG Baldur's Gate 3 is based on. I met another player who likes rolling rangers at a D&D table earlier this week, and I actually high-fived her because I was so excited at my one-woman ranger defense squad doubling its membership. Making your character a ranger in BG3 (which has some very slight differences) is even better; you can essentially brew a rogue that is better at taking damage, but can still do most other things you traditionally use a rogue for. Let me explain.

I admit, I was a little piqued by Homeworld 3's redesigned Mothership, which lies flat as a doormat - an act of blasphemy akin to flipping a crucifix upside down, or wearing a baseball cap backwards in your 50s. But I've come round to the new Mothership after reading Blackbird Interactive art director Karl Gryc's thoughts on its creation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis, the mobile RPG retelling the FFVII saga, finally has a release date. The game was first announced in February 2021. 
Ever Crisis hits iOS and Android on September 7. The game is a free-to-play single-player chapter-structured RPG that spans the entire FFVII timeline. Expect to relieve key elements of the original 1997 game plus new story elements written by FF VII Remake story and scenario writer Kazushige Nojima that center on a young Sephiroth. Gameplay includes active-time battles, and monetization takes the form of microtransactions for certain weapons and equipment. See it in action in the latest trailer from Summer Game Fest in June.


This will be the latest stab at bringing FFVII content to mobile. In January, Square Enix shut down Final Fantasy VII The First Soldier, its mobile battle royale that was revealed alongside Ever Crisis two years ago. Hopefully, Ever Crisis has a better run and offers a solid appetizer until Final Fantasy VII Rebirth launches next year.]]></summary>

Murdle is a free daily logic puzzle game that you can play in-browser at murdle.com. They're like luxury versions of those ones you'd get in thick, half-sized paperbacks from WH Smiths, next to the books of sudoku, where you have to figure out who lives in which house and what colour their car is with clues like 'Peter does not not have a four-wheeled drive. Murdle is better, though, because the puzzles are themed around being a detective - or, technically, a Deductive - called Logico solving a murder. You get a new one every day, and it's neat-o.

Both are decorated according to the forthcoming open world space-me-do's "NASApunk" aesthetic, a blend of cool whites, blues and yellows which I will admit to finding rather attractive, as somebody who generally finds gaming hardware aesthetics an absolute turn-off. It's certainly better-looking than Nvidia's lurid Cyberpunk 2077 GPU from 2020, but if you're similarly beguiled, there's an unfortunate catch: only 500 of these GPU/CPU sets are being made, and they're exclusively available as part of a Quakecon giveaway.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overwatch 2 has launched on Steam and well, Activision Blizzard are probably regretting that right now. At the time of writing, the game has attracted 22,619 reviews, many written by people who've already been playing for a while on Battle.net, of which just 15% give the game a thumbs-up, making for an "Overwhelmingly Negative" rating. Tucked in amongst the usual troll reviews, cheeky links to Team Fortress 2 and dubious ASCII jokes there are some rather extensive essays on the game's direction and faults.


Many players still have axes to grind about Overwatch 2's switch to a free-to-play battle pass model - check out our launch-day Overwatch 2 review for the nitty gritty - which introduced levelling for new characters and cosmetics to a game that once handed you its entire roster almost without caveats, and encouraged you to experiment freely. Others are angry about Overwatch 2's story-driven PVE modes, the supposed focus of the sequel - announced as a full-blown Hero Missions mode with skill trees and levelling, then dramatically stripped back to a series of separately sold seasonal co-op missions, much as with Halloween events in the first Overwatch. There are complaints about Blizzard's recent handling of the Overwatch League, and more subjective quibbles about the switch to a 5v5 team format and the precise ratio of DPS to Support heroes. A few reviews touch on Activision-Blizzard's alleged culture of sexual harassment and claims of unfair labour practices, which make Overwatch's emphasis on team spirit ring rather hollow.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year, Destiny 2 and Horizon Zero Dawn (among many other roles) actor Lance Reddick passed away unexpectedly. In Destiny 2, Reddick played Commander Zavala – an important recurring character in Destiny lore. Reddick was also an outspoken fan of the game that engaged with the community often, so recasting his role was always going to be a difficult task.
Today, Bungie announced that legendary actor Keith David would be taking over the role. David is an accomplished film and television actor appearing in movies like The Thing and TV shows like Community (pictured below).
He has also voiced a number of characters in animated films and video games. He played Dr. Facilier in The Princess and the Frog and he played Keith David in Saint's Row IV. Perhaps his most famous video game role, however, is that of The Arbiter in Halo games. David is no stranger to working with Bungie.
In the post on Bungie's site announcing the casting, David said, "I am honored to continue the great work of Lance Reddick as Zavala. Lance captured the character's sense of integrity so wonderfully. It is my intention to continue that work."]]></summary>

After an absolute dearth of new content on the tail end of the original game's lifecycle, Overwatch 2 did little to regain favor with its community, thanks to polarizing changes to the game's structure and the cancellation of the highly anticipated Hero Missions. However, with Season 6, titled Invasion, the Overwatch 2 development team is making huge strides to release a content drop absolutely jam-packed with new modes, new maps, and even a new support hero. Following my exclusive look at Overwatch 2's Toronto Story Mission back in June, I was once again invited to go hands-on with Overwatch 2: Invasion – this time, with the entire Invasion update.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's possible you've already played some of Baldur's Gate 3, with Larian Studios having had their massive fantasy RPG in a successful early access for just under three years. It's very good. But if you're one of the many who haven't, the premise is thus: an ancient evil has, as ancient evil is wont to do, arisen once more to threaten the great walled city of Baldur's Gate, and by extension the surrounds, and by further extension the world and all the deep gnomes, elves and sexy demon wizards therein. Through happenstance and literal brainworms, you and the band of strange adventurers you meet in the first act are the only ones who can save the day. Don't worry, you don't need to remember or have played Baldur's Gate 1 or 2. So. Off you go, then.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Surprising few but delighting many, id Software and Bethesda have released a Quake 2 remaster to inaugurate this year's Quakecon. An enhanced edition of the 1997 game, it includes the mission packs The Reckoning and Ground Zero alongside a PC version of Quake 2 on N64. All that for £8 or $10, plus a brand new expansion titled Call of the Machine, developed by Wolfenstein: The New Order studio MachineGames.
While not as beloved or enduring as its predecessor or successor, Quake 2 is one of the Grand Old Shooters. I recall being introduced to it at a covert LAN party in a school IT room, plonking myself down at a monitor and instantly being reduced to a fine red mist (and in the game, etc). The singleplayer campaign had you scrapping across a muddy alien world with shotgun and hyperblaster, with larger levels than in the original Quake, and missions where you'd use heads as keys.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Had you asked me yesterday about the best Baldur's Gate 3 class, I might have picked Bard - versatile, swish, a solid support both in and out of combat - but that was before I discovered the ancient and honourable Larian discipline of barrelmancy. As the name suggests, it's all about doing mildly game-breaking things with barrels, crates and other heavy containers, by taking advantage of high strength, the Throw command, and the fact that Larian RPG characters can somehow fit items as big as they are into their inventories, without bursting apart like rotten haggis.
A straightforward tactic: consider lugging a few oil barrels into a throne room, and dropping them all around the resident big cheese before you confront him. Given reasonably careful distribution, it's possible to finish a whole battle this way in a single turn. Fortunately, while Baldur's Gate NPCs can be eagle-eyed when it comes to sneaking rogues, they're perfectly indifferent to people surrounding them with heavy explosives.

The nearest I've come to doing so is that one episode of the Simpsons. The major things I am given to understand about it are that it is very confusing, sexy in a ghoulish way, and 100% comprised of memes in the same way that Hamlet has retrospectively become a book's worth of quotations.
I have, however, played a surprising number of very decent games that are influenced by Twin Peaks - Zelda: Link's Awakening, Silent Hill and the amazing Lone Survivor, to pick a few that I know about for sure. So who knows, perhaps I won't be utterly bamfoodled and confluzzled by Twin Peaks: Into The Night, an unofficial PS1-style adaptation of the game that has just surfaced on Itch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lords Of The Fallen is a curious sequel/reboot of the 2014 Lords Of The Fallen. It takes the Soulslike credentials of the original, gives them a grittier makeover, a much bigger world, and a magical lantern that reveals a gnarlier version of the universe you can actually step into.
Having spent roughly 90-minutes with the game, I'd say it has strong Dark Souls 2 energy mixed with a realm-hopping gimmick that's surprisingly impressive. While it's definitely too early to make big claims, I could see LOTF as a genuine competitor in the saturated Soulslike arena.

The first Lords of the Fallen released in 2014, a time when From Software’s Dark Souls series consisted of two games. Bloodborne wasn’t out, and Elden Ring hadn’t yet redefined what the action-RPG genre can be. Lords of the Fallen was among the first Soulslikes to appear on my radar. It didn’t hit for me and I put it down after a few hours. It was slow, clunky, and allowed for little wiggle room in gameplay style. I yearned for the flexibility of Dark Souls’ various classes and the speed some of them allowed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been bolting together some ideas for a longer Starfield feature and while plying the sliplanes of Reddit, stumbled on this conversation about the game's handling of time. As many of you will know/be very weary of hearing, Starfield features hundreds of planets, together with moons and space stations, scattered around the galaxy in different solar systems. Real-life planets, of course, aren't fixed points: they rotate and orbit their stars at different speeds, depending on their mass and distance, which means that days, nights and seasons have different durations. 


Starfield appears to model this to some degree. Bethesda's Starfield Direct from June makes a fleeting distinction (thanks, JuiceHead33) between "local time", corresponding to where you land on a planet's surface, and "UT", which sounds like an abbreviation of "universal time", and presumably describes the passage of time throughout the wider galaxy. Both are displayed in 24 hour format. You can explore planet locations at different local times, as indicated by your fancy neo-Casio watch, with shifting lighting conditions that seem to correspond to the spinning of the planet around its sun. There's footage showing one particular area, The Hitching Post in Akila City, by day and night. The game also seems to model planetary alignments - there's the beginnings of a solar eclipse visible during one segment of the video.

For this exact reason, Stray Gods: The Role-Playing Musical caught my eye, exciting both my inner fan of musicals and my inner fan of games.

Five years ago, when he was invited to a pre-GDC meeting to pitch game ideas to an unnamed friend, Wintory had one that really excited him. It was a musical game – not just a game with musical numbers distributed throughout, but where the player has control over the music itself. Wintory's friend was less than enthusiastic.
"He said very graciously, but in no uncertain terms, 'I hate that idea, and I want nothing to do with that,'" Wintory recalls. He smiles as he tells the story, finding humor in the irony that this rejected pitch eventually became the game I'm currently interviewing him about.

However, none of those updates were as substantial as the one we got on the upcoming Scarlet and Violet DLC, with the showcase spending ten minutes of its 35-minute runtime to reveal new Pokémon, new areas, and even a release date. Here's everything you need to know about Pokémon Scarlet and Vilet: The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero.


We knew that one of the expansions, The Teal Mask, would be coming in the fall – but now we know the exact date. On September 13, you'll be able to leave the Paldea region and explore the area around Kitakami Village, which is where the DLC takes place. Accor…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you were looking forward to playing the pro-wrestling-themed RPG WrestleQuest today for its launch, it looks like that card was subject to change. The game has suffered a last-minute delay and will now arrive on August 22.
Developer Mega Cat Studios and publisher Skybound Games announced the delay yesterday evening, explaining the cause was due to the discovery of a save glitch. The statement reads,
“When performing final checks on one of our launch platforms, we discovered it was possible for players to lose their save game progress when playing WrestleQuest on multiple different devices. Because this is a game filled with hours of content and player progress is so important, we could never bodyslam our fans like that.”
While it’s a bummer to see the game get pushed back mere hours before launch, it’s a good thing the team caught this issue before it could affect players. Curious wrestling and RPG fans will have to wait another couple of weeks, but at least they'll presumably be able to play with some peace of mind. 
WrestleQuest unfolds in a world molded after action figure wrestling leagues with protagonist Randy “Muchacho Man” Santos on a quest to become the ultimate superstar. Inspired by classics like Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy VI, you’ll partner with a large cast of fellow grapplers to unleash special attacks and tag team moves on your opponents. In addition to fictional personalities, several real-life stars appear in the game, including Jeff Jarrett, Jake “The Snake” Roberts, Sgt. Slaughter, among others.
WresleQuest will be available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, PC, and on mobile via Netflix.]]></summary>

Our chatty electric rodent is, of course, joined by his human partner Tim Goodman. The trailer also reacquaints us with Tim’s family, his friend Rachel and her major father, along with some of the Pokémon lending a helpful hand like the clue-sniffing Growlithe.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two of the most popular Pokémon arrive in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet's Paldea region through limited-time events. Best of all, you can add one of the most coveted Pokémon from Gen I, Mew, to your party for free right now. Then, you can gear up to challenge the powerful Mewtwo during the aptly named Get Mew And Mewtwo event.
Beginning now, you can receive Mew as a Mystery Gift in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. To do this, simply go to the Mystery Gift in-game menu while connected to the internet and enter the password "GETYOURMEW" before September 18. Each Mew's Tera Type, nature, and moves will be different to reflect the Mythical Pokémon's flexible capabilities. You'll be able to add Mew to your party and continue your adventures around the Paldea region, but you can also participate in the second portion of this event.
The second phase of this event kicks off September 1, with Mewtwo appearing in special Tera Raid battles. If you're able to defeat Mewtwo in these Tera Raid battles, you'll be rewarded with the opportunity to catch a Mewtwo with the Mightiest Mark, meaning these will be seven-star Tera Raid battles. The Pokémon Company also teases that if you challenge Mewtwo with Mew, you can expect "something special."
Pokémon Scarlet and Violet will also play host to several other Tera Raid battle events during this time. Wave 1 runs from today until August 17, Wave 2 runs from August 18 until August 31, and then Mewtwo finally arrives from September 1 to September 17.


During the same Pokémon Presents livestream, we also learned a lot about the upcoming Pokémon Scarlet and Violet expansions. For more on Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, be sure to check out our review. If you're more about the nostalgic side of the Pokémon franchise, this Pokémon Presents had you covered there as well, as Nintendo Switch Online also added two '90s Pokémon spin-offs to its classic game catalog.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Call of Duty Modern Warfare III will be released on November 10, and we got the briefest of teases in a new trailer today. Activision confirmed today’s reveal last week after the game leaked online.
The teaser doesn’t provide much to go on except the release date; platforms are unannounced, but we imagine it'll be on the usual suspects. Sledgehammer Games is taking the reins, making it the first Modern Warfare title not made by Infinity Ward (but it's still assisting, as all Call of Duty studios tend to). Sledgehammer's last entry was 2021’s Call of Duty: Vanguard, and it also developed WWII and Advanced Warfare. 


In the meantime, be sure to check out our Modern Warfare II review and read how that game and Warzone will continue to get content updates in the form of new celebrity operators such as Snoop Dogg and Nicki Minaj. You can also read about how Sony signed a deal with Microsoft to keep the franchise on PlayStation for the next decade as part of the ongoing Microsoft/Activision acquisition.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Almost exactly one year ago, SNK announced a new Fatal Fury game, the first in over 20 years, was in the works. During EVO this weekend, the company revealed the game’s title is Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves, alongside a new teaser trailer.
The video shows off some brief in-game footage of staples Terry Bogard and Rock Howard in action. Unfortunately, we don’t see much more than that, and SNK has only promised to share more information at a later date. 


The last Fatal Fury game was 1999’s Garou: Mark of the Wolves, so a new entry has been a long time coming for fans. Hopefully, it arrives sooner than later and is another big fighting game to anticipate during a relative boom period for the genre thanks to Street Fighter 6 and the upcoming Mortal Kombat 1 and Tekken 8.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Indie publisher Devolver Digital has announced a slew of delays for some of its more anticipated titles on the horizon. Framed through a humorous parody of a Nintendo Direct, Devolver released a "Devolver Delayed Showcase" to tell players all about the games they won't be playing in 2023. The showcase highlights five games in particular: The Plucky Squire, Skate Story, Anger Foot, Stick it to the Stickman, and Pepper Grinder.
"We have some exciting news about next year," one host says. "This year's delays," the other host follows up. "Some of our brightest upcoming titles are finding their way to 2024!"
The Plucky Squire, a game that bounces between 2D and 3D gameplay, is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. Pixel-art platformer Pepper Grinder is currently slated to arrive on Switch and PC. Meanwhile, roguelite brawler Stick it to the Stickman, kickflipping sports-action game Skate Story, and foot-based first-person shooter Anger Foot are currently only listed for PC. 
You can see the full Devolver Delayed Showcase below.


Devolver Digital has had a solid 2023, with titles like Terra Nil receiving positive reviews, fan-favorite Bleak Sword DX making its way to Switch and PC, and new content for Cult of the Lamb, but today's delays are sure to disappoint some. However, by this point in time, many players recognize that it's better to delay a game than to launch it before it's ready, and with Gunbrella and The Talos Principle 2 still slated for 2023, the indie publisher still has seemingly a lot in store for fans before the calendar changes over to 2024.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Red Dead Redemption is one of the best games of the PlayStation 3/Xbox 360 era, and it hasn’t migrated from those platforms since it arrived in 2010. After 13 years, that finally changes with a surprise jump to PlayStation 4 and Switch.
Rockstar announced today that Double Eleven Studios is creating these ports, which include the zombie-themed Undead Nightmare expansion in one package. This also means that PlayStation 5 players can experience the game due to PS4 backwards compatibility. While it's unclear if these versions feature any kind of performance or graphical improvements, they do have additional language support for simplified and traditional Chinese, Korean, Polish, Brazilian Portuguese, Russian, and Latin American Spanish. 


Red Dead Redemption follows former outlaw John Marston on a quest to track down the remaining members of his old crew, the Van der Linde Gang, in order to save his family. Its prequel, Red Dead Redemption II, arrived in 2018. If you missed out on the original the first time around, you can pick up Red Dead Redemption digitally on PS4 and Switch on August 17 for $49.99. Physical copies hit stores on October 13. To learn more about the game, be sure to read our original reviews for the base game and Undead Nightmare.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following her announcement as the first all-new character to join the Street Fighter 6 roster by way of DLC, A.K.I. gave fans a taste of what to expect when she is added to the game this fall. During this weekend's Evo 2023 fighting game tournament, we received a host of new announcements, including new characters added to the roster of the upcoming Mortal Kombat 1 and even a surprise TMNT collaboration with Street Fighter 6. However, Capcom didn't stop there, as it gave us the first teaser trailer for its 20th playable character, A.K.I.
Described as "a manaical poison aficionado," A.K.I. certainly seems to fit right in with the long lineage of over-the-top and deranged characters within the Street Fighter universe. You can check out the surprisingly dark teaser trailer for A.K.I. below.


While we already knew A.K.I. was planned, the teaser comes hot on the heels of the release of Rashid, the first DLC character for Street Fighter 6. Rashid debuted in Street Fighter V, but joined the roster of Street Fighter 6 less than two weeks prior to this teaser. A.K.I. arrives in Street Fighter 6 this fall. Both characters – as well as the two remaining members of Year 1, Ed and Akuma – are included in the Deluxe Edition, Ultimate Edition, or Year 1 Character Pass. Rashid is also currently available for individual purchase for 350 Fighter Coins (approximately $7). Regardless of how you obtain Rashid, you also get his secondary outfit and two additional color options. It stands to reason that A.K.I. will follow a similar release method.

Beginning tomorrow, August 8, TMNT-themed costumes, cosmetic items, and emotes will let players transform their Street Fighter 6 avatars into Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael, and Michelangelo. The event also includes TMNT stamps and titles, plus wallpapers for camera mode. Even the Battle Hub is getting in on the spirit by decking it out with Turtles banners, signs, and trailers. In the trailer below, it looks as silly as you would expect.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat 1’s roster continues to expand, and the latest trailer reveals a returning staple and two long-lost fighters from the series’ 2000s era: Reptile, Ashrah, and Havik.
The lengthy trailer provides a great look at the new looks and abilities of each character as well as their respective roles in the story. Reptile is back in his more human form but can still shapeshift into his natural, intimidating lizard body to devour opponents.  
Fans of 2004’s Mortal Kombat: Deception should be happy to see the returns of Ashrah and Havik. Each made their debut in that game, and neither has appeared in the series since Deception’s follow-up, Mortal Kombat: Armageddon in 2006. Ashrah sports a much different look and moveset but remains a demoness mostly cleansed of her inherent evil. Havik appears to retain his chaotic brand of body-contorting, limb-tearing offense. Sareena has also been confirmed as a new Kameo fighter to fan the flame of 2000s nostalgia. Check out the new trailer and a fresh batch of screenshots below. 


       

Mortal Kombat 1 launches on September 19 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. Be sure to check out the previous roster reveal trailers for Geras, Smoke, and Rain.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Tate Multimedia and developer Trialforge Studio have released the debut trailer for Deathbound, its new Soulslike action RPG with a unique class-based twist coming to Steam next year. 
Set in a crumbling civilization where unnatural science clashes with fanatical faith, players take on the role of a warrior set on confronting the Church of Death. In this world – Ziêminal – there's no good and no evil; just monsters and enemies in your way. And if today's Deathbound trailer is anything to go on, they won't go down without a fight. 
Check out the Deathbound reveal trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see in the trailer above, players can freely switch between various heroes of different classes in a party at any time, and they'll need to do so to survive in specific situations. Trialforge Studio calls this a "Binding System, allowing players to absorb the essence of the fallen warriors found throughout the world." Using the collected essence, players can obtain new skills and abilities to transform their playstyle, or they can use it to form a party of heroes they can then switch between. 
Binding also unlocks Morphstrikes, which combines all of a party's power into a devastating blow. 

"The memories and identities of the fallen will be uncovered through Binding as well," a press release reads. "In addition to environment and items, essence will reveal the narrative behind the world of Ziêminal and its inhabitants. Though players must tread carefully when Binding, as not all heroes converge harmoniously. The conflicts caused by divergent essences absorbed will greatly impact the gameplay and narrative alike." 
Deathbound is due out sometime in 2024 on Steam.]]></summary>

While handheld titles, the poorly received Sonic the Hedgehog 4, and other games like Sonic Generations and Sonic Colors contained 2D gameplay, Sonic Mania felt like the true successor to the beloved titles that appeared on Genesis and Sega CD throughout the 1990s. A sequel felt all but inevitable, but when Sega and Sonic Mania mastermind Christian Whitehead decided to amicably go in creatively different directions (read the full story here), Sonic Team creative officer Takashi Iizuka still wanted to build on the success experienced with Sonic Mania.
"During Sonic Mania's development, I didn't expect this level of fan reaction or success," Iizuka says. "That success created the opportunity to think a…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Somerville is bringing its mysterious alien invasion to PlayStation consoles on August 31. The game comes from Jumpship, a studio formed by former Playdead (Limbo, Inside) CEO Dino Patti.
It centers on a small family rocked by a sudden alien invasion of Earth, who must now survive by running and hiding. The game’s eerie atmosphere and lack of dialogue lend to the game’s enigmatic nature, and multiple endings offer various truths about the threat you face.


Somerville launched for Xbox and PC last November to generally warm reviews, though was noted for its rough technical performance, which has since been improved in post-launch updates. In a press release, Jumpship promises the PlayStation port will be the “best version of Somerville yet” and will feature DualSense haptic feedback.
For more on Somerville, you can read Game Informer's Somerville review and editor Kyle Hilliard's opinion piece on why it's the best alien invasion game since Half-Life 2.]]></summary>

We've played a chunk of it and enjoyed it – read our full hands-on preview thoughts here – but now, we've heard a track from the game's score. And you can too because we can exclusively reveal that track today. 
It's big, robust, and heroic, fitting if the full game is anything like what we've gone hands-on with. After listening to this track, we interviewed the game's audio director Aubrey Hodges, composer Jamie K, and media composer Tom Hawk about the game's score, how the team created a soundtrack that blends hip-hop with orchestral arrangements, and so much more.

It will begin at 6 a.m. PT/9 a.m. ET and run for roughly 35 minutes. The company announced this with a short teaser clip on the official Pokémon Twitter account, and you can watch that for yourself below:

As you can see, the teaser doesn't reveal too much beyond details of when the Pokémon Presents is happening. However, near its start, there's an interesting use of purple-pink and neon lighting. Perhaps it's alluding to Mewtwo or Mew, or maybe to Ryme City from Pokémon Detective Pikachu, which features plenty of neon lighting in the movie. It could be an allu…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A little while has passed since the release of 2.7.0, and we are now excited to present you with the bugfix release 2.7.1.
We have included a significant amount of fixes and small improvements, in particular:
Added ScummVM Log file viewer, so you can easily report the problems on platforms with limited file access, e.g. Android, iOS or even modern Windows.
Fixed the shader-based scaler loading on some platforms.
Added multiple improvements to AGI, AGS, Cryomni3D and 12 more engines.
We also improved the detection of Broken Sword 1 & Broken Sword 2, so more original versions get properly detected. Thank you to those who submitted bug reports about this, and if you still locate a version that is not recognised, please report it to us (beware that the frankenstein versions that are floating around the internet will not be accepted, only those copied from the original media).
For the full and comprehensive list of notable changes, please refer to the Release Notes.
If you are as excited about the release as we are, you can share our joy by downloading it from our downloads page. If you are using Windows, macOS, or either of the Ubuntu Snap or Flatpack packages, the autoupdater will pick up the ScummVM 2.7.1 release automatically. For our Android app users, the update will be available on the Play Store.
Thank you very much for your continued support. Enjoy!
