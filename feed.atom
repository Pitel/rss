        <updated>2023-10-03T12:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Forest Cathedral is an environmental thriller that hit Xbox Series X/S and PC earlier this year in March. Now, Game Informer can exclusively reveal it hits PlayStation 5 on October 31, making this a great spooky experience for the holiday. 
For the uninitiated, The Forest Cathedral is inspired by events surrounding real-life scientist Rachel Carson's investigation into Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, otherwise known as the harmful DDT pesticide. Publisher Whitethorn Games says this game is "a dramatic reimagining of Carson's environmental science book, Silent Spring." 
You can get a look at it in The Forest Cathedral PS5 release date trailer below: 


As you can see in the trailer above, in The Forest Cathedral, players take on the role of Rachel in her new field research biologist position on a mysterious island. What begins as simply completing weekly work tasks becomes something more horrific when Rachel learns about what DDT is doing to the area. Whitethorn says players "will slowly uncover the horrific effects of the pesticide using advanced environment technology to complete puzzles that weave together 3D exploration with 2D platforming." 

As far as gameplay goes, players switch between Rachel Carson in a 3D world and the "Little Man" inside the 2D world of Rachel's scanning tools. It's in this 2D world where players will solve puzzles and complete platforming challenges.
The Forest Cathedral is available right now on Xbox Series X/S and PC via Steam. It hits PS5 on Halloween.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel's Spider-Man is almost here. Set to hit PlayStation 5 exclusively on October 20, PlayStation and developer Insomniac Games have continued to ramp up excitement surrounding the sequel with trailers, gameplay, and more. And last night, PlayStation released a new extended 60-second TV spot that gives us a more cinematic look at these heroes' latest adventure. 
The trailer is CGI and it's gorgeous. We see Peter Parker and Miles Morales come to grips with the challenges before them, both in the suit and out of it; all to the backdrop of a massive fight in broad daylight against Venom. If this trailer is any indication, Venom is quite the formidable foe for these two. 
Check it out for yourself in the Marvel's Spider-Man 2 trailer below: 


As you can see, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 continues to look great, and fortunately, we don't have to wait long to get our hands on it because it hits PS5 on October 20. 
In the meantime, read about how Marvel's Spider-Man 2 features more than 65 suits and then read our thoughts on the game after going hands-on with it. Check out Game Informer's Marvel's Spider-Man 2 New Gameplay Today after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a good year for Pokemon fans who have enjoyed DLC for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, as well as plenty of Pokemon TCG releases. We're also getting a new Detective Pikachu game titled Detective Pikachu Returns. Set to release on October 6, it will continue the mystery-solving adventures of the gruff-voiced yellow rodent. 




In the lead-up to Detective Pikachu Returns, Nintendo has released a story trailer recapping the events of the first. This is great for newcomers who want to jump in without playing the first game. It's also useful for return players, as Detective Pikachu was released in 2018, so you may need to brush up on your knowledge.

Detective Pikachu's story so far 


As the trailer reminds us, the franchise features a Pikachu who fancies himself a great detective. In the first game, he crosses paths with a boy named Tim Goodman. Together, they search for Detective Harry, who happens to be Tim's dad.


While hunting for Harry, they uncover crimes being committed by Pokemon influenced by a strange chemical called R. Pikachu and Tim manage to get to the bottom of things, though they never do locate Harry. They haven't stopped searching, and it appears the hunt continues in Detective Pikachu Returns. 


The upcoming game has the opportunity to try plenty of new things now that the franchise has leapt from the 3DS to the Switch. Trailers reveal it'll feature Pokemon that weren't around when the first Detective Pikachu game was released, such as Morpeko.

The new patch reverts companion behaviour to their pre-Patch 3 behaviour, for a less frustrating RPG experience. In even more momentous tidings, it re-shaves that cat everybody loves. Ah, videogames.

Sea of Stars was released over a month ago now, and it's safe to say that it'll be featuring on many a gamer's GOTY list come December. Sabotage's RPG is a gorgeous, gloriously clever homage to 16-bit classics that manages to modernise things while adding its own unique spirit to the formula.
The game was in development for several years, and back when the project went through a round of crowdfunding, Zion — one of our lovely video team — took the opportunity to have a memorial put in the game's Crypt. This wouldn't be just a stock headstone with some vetted text message, but rather a custom-made statue created by the art team according to specific requests and instructions.

It's all about the little touches: check out those azure windmill blades, flickering in the breeze! And how about the little animations of people hefting barrels of water? Man, it makes me want to jump in there and start stamping on everything, wailing and babbling like a mad god. But let's not do that. Let's play the demo instead. It gives you three maps, and lands ahead of the game's early access launch on 13th December.

There are also fixes for a shader compilation bug that may, nonetheless, still exist for AMD GPUs when playing this latest iteration of the developer's free-to-play team and objective-based shooter. Many of the larger issues returning players have, such as the absence of Mac support, are yet to be addressed.

As its launch draws nearer, Remedy has been cranking up the marketing and slowly revealing more of what we can expect from Wake's next horror adventure. 


Remedy has Alan Wake merch on sale, including a pretty blue thermos. Unfortunately, things haven't gone according to plan, and many players who want a thermos find themselves without one, though it does appear that Remedy is attempting to fix things. Nevertheless, it has resulted in a lot of upset, illustrating just how much the thermos means to Alan Wake fans.

If the Pokémon is registered in your Pokédex and you highlight slot four, five, or six in the party, the game will then crash.

Shigeru Miyamoto is perhaps the most legendary figure in all of gaming and over the years we've heard plenty of stories about how he's often changed the course of development, or come up with a ground-breaking idea that's changed the industry forever.

Nintendo has announced it will be hosting a special event called "Bowser Bash" next week with the assistance of Jakks Pacific.
There have not really been any specific details provided just yet but it is going to take place ahead of Halloween on "Friday the 13th" of October, between 5pm and 7pm. Jakks Pacific is a toy maker, so there could potentially be some Mario-themed products up for grabs.

I wish I could say my adventurer, the intrepid Eric, met with a glorious end, by the blade or in valiant sacrifice, but he did not. Little Eric died bumping into bugs in a cave in his hometown. And then he respawned and tried again.


These introductory steps in Moonring really set the tone, as much as a single screenshot could. Fable co-creator and long-time industry veteran Dene Carter released Moonring over the weekend, under the banner Fluttermind, for free on Steam.

The official Twitter page announced the news on Monday. Epic Games has provided no specific timing.

It seems likely that this Fall Guys Toy Story crossover may replace the current Fame Pass, which has Final Fantasy XIV characters running around in this unusual battle royale. If you are reading this on Monday, you still have time to get the Fame Pass and unlock at least some of the characters like the Fat Chocobo.

In Foundry, players are tasked with using their imagination to build an efficient factory in a procedurally-generated sandbox. Prior to the announcement, Foundry had climbed to the top of itch.io as a top-selling game. The game can be compared to similar factory-building titles like Satisfactory and Factorio. Players start at the bottom of the technological totem pole, having to manually mine and process resources. Eventually, you unlock the ability to craft new machinery, develop technologies, and automate your entire production line.

We were promised that it was motion controls – not the next generation of graphical splendor – that would carry video games into the future. But while Wii Sports was fun, we wanted to see what motion controls could do outside a set of family-friendly minigame compilations. The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess didn’t make very good use of the controls, but it was really a port of a GameCube title. So, we just needed to wait a bit longer, and the vision Nintendo promised us would eventually arrive.


Sometime before, we just gave up and realized that motion controls just kind of suck in general, Escape from Bug Island hit the shelves. The only thing I really knew about it was that it was terrible. Even during a software drought t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sergiy Galyonkin has announced via Twitter today that he has resigned from his role as Director of Publishing Strategy at Epic Games. He had been with the company for over eight years.


In his post, Sergiy Galyonkin thanks Epic for the aid they’ve donated in support of Ukraine during Russia’s ongoing invasion. He outlines his role in establishing Epic’s direction (which he refers to as Epic 4.0), but opines that he doesn’t feel he is a fit for their new course (Epic 5.0).


“Now, Epic Games is on its way to transforming from a game developer, engine creator, and publisher into a platform - Epic 5.0. I am not a good fit for this new version of Epic; it requires people of a different kind.”


It’s interesting to note that Sergey Galyonkin was the creator of the Steam Spy service in 2015, which tracks sales through the Steam platform. He then used his experience with tracking the platform to help Epic create the Epic Games Store.


I’m not going to speculate on the deeper meaning of Galyonkin’s departure, as I don’t want to put words in his mouth. I do have to wonder about the timing of this, as just last week Epic Games cut 16% of its workforce as a way of refocusing. It just feels bad, and I would be shocked if the two things weren’t related.


At the very least, Galyonkin goes on to say, “I plan to remain in the gaming industry. I also hope to be more vocal now that I don’t have to worry about the PR department knocking on my DMs.” Considering the valuable insight he shared before joining Epic, I’m personally looking forward to seeing what he dishes out now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Aside from some legendary monsters and surprisingly strong event battles, Pokemon Scarlet & Violet loves pitting players against starter Pokemon from previous generations in Tera Raid battles. And this weekend, it seems like we'll return to that standard with a slight twist. As the next 7-Star Tera Raid event, all Pokemon Scarlet & Violet trainers will face off against Hisuian Decidueye.


According to the official Pokemon account on Twitter, the Hisuian Decidueye Tera Raid will utilize the Grass Tera Type. By default it's a Grass/Fighting-Type hybrid, though its movepool has a lot of potential coverage. So while several Pokemon fare well against Grass-Types, you may need to wait until we know its attacks to form an optimal counter. Like past 7-Star raids, this one will feature the Mightiest Mark that gives it the "Unrivaled" title if you catch it, which is a nice perk for hardcore collectors.


This isn’t the first time we’ve seen Decidueye in a Tera Raid. In fact, the last time we saw this ‘mon in Scarlet & Violet was last March. However, this one is specifically the Hisuian variant from Pokemon Legends: Arceus. 


This raid will be available in two date ranges: October 5 at 9:00 a.m. JST / 8:00 p.m. EST to October 9 at 8:59 a.m. JST / 7:59 p.m. EST, and then again on October 12 at 9:00 a.m. JST / 8:00 p.m. EST to October 15 at 8:59 a.m. JST / 7:59 p.m. EST. Whether you challenge Hisuian Decidueye this weekend or next weekend, best of luck!

Having selected the Fighter vocation, I spawned in with a party of Pawns and three quest objectives to reach. However, that big ol'bird was right there. And if you think I’m not going to stab it at least once, then clearly we have different gaming priorities. What ensued was a dramatic tussle of climbing on the monster, taking shots when I could, all while my army of Pawns fought by my side and shouted canned, unnecessary phrases.


After depleting one of its four health bars, the griffin flew high into the sky, putting an abrupt end to our battle. However, once I looked at my party, I noticed I was down a Pawn. “Where’s Sara?” I asked aloud, only to look up and realize she was still on the griffin, who was now a mile up i…]]></summary>

Super Mario Bros. Wonder definitely isn't coming out on the NES, but this excellent fan-made commercial almost convinced us that it was.
YouTuber LUIZ do Comercial has created various "fake commercials" for video games, and his latest creation is a work of 8-bit art. Luiz has taken the over-the-top style of '80s commercial and combined it with actual gameplay of a reimagined Super Mario Bros. Wonder on the NES.

To get some insight into how the game came together and learn about working with Shigeru Miyamoto, we spoke with chief and programming director Yuji Kando and planning director Yutaka Hiramuki over e-mail.
Game Informer: In 2015, Shigeru Miyamoto said in an interview that Pikmin 4 development was “very close to completion.” Was that statement inaccurate at the time?
Kando: After the development for Pikmin 3 ended, we started development for Pikmin 4 as a small team.
As we made several attempts and tried out various things, there were moments when we could see the game take shape, but since we had to prioritize other projects, we weren't able to create the deve…]]></summary>

The fan art shows Sora, Donald, and Goofy furiously riding one of the bikes from the movie, each with their own customized appearance. We also see a few keyblade designs inspired by the Pixar flick.

A, of course, stands for Attacking by means of things like energy rifles, electro-batons and shotguns. B is for Back-stabbing, referring to the stealthy player who may stack objects so as to clamber into vents, and whack guards deftly in the noggin to escape detection.
And C is for Conversing, referring to the act of wooing civilians - who thus far seem miraculously unbothered by your menacing hooded appearance and sepulchral accent - so as to procure door codes and the location of keycards. You can see all these approaches in the game's new trailer, below.

We recently had the opportunity to take a look at the freeplay mode of the upcoming sequel Frostpunk 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the big releases of October is Remedy's Alan Wake 2. The first game was released in 2010, and since then, Wake has been a central part of the Remedy Connected Universe which is set to expand in his next game. According to Remedy, newcomers will be able to jump straight into the game, though there will be plenty of content to please returning fans. 




Music played a big role in Alan Wake where Poets of the Fall is depicted as the fictional band Old Gods of Asgard. The music was used to help set the game's tone. In the upcoming game, the fictional band will be returning and it'll be played by Poets of the Fall once more.

Team17 has confirmed that it will be commencing a company restructure that will likely result in multiple job losses. In addition, it has also announced an 'amicable' split with CEO Michael Pattison. This comes following recent reports of significant layoffs at Epic Games.
As reported by Eurogamer and VG247, Team17 has begun a 'period of consultation' during which a significant number of redundancies are likely to be made. It confirmed the departure of Michael Pattison in a statement to VG247:

Publisher New Blood Interactive has just announced that DUSK will get the HD treatment to mark the occasion, with a lovely teaser trailer to accompany the news. The HD version of DUSK will be fully optional and made available within a couple of months, around December, according to the devs themselves.


The team behind DUSK has taken it upon itself to really make the HD version of the game special, according to the announcement. Rather than simply upgrading the base game for all owners, which might not even be desirable in the first place, devs are releasing DUSK HD as an optional download instead.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week ended with a dire flood of layoffs in the games industry, including Sega, Ubisoft, Blizzard, and Epic games. Unfortunately, this week seems to be following the trend – Team17, developer of the Worms series, and publisher of games like Blasphemous, Dredge, and more, has announced layoffs as well, according to Eurogamer.
The job losses, which are due to a "company restructure," will eliminate about 50 positions from the company, and the majority of those positions will be in the publisher's QA department. Eurogamer also reports the news was delivered to employees during an emergency town hall meeting this morning.
In addition to members of the QA team, Team17 CEO Michael Pattison will also be stepping down, according to a statement received by VG247. This stands in sharp contrast to many other recent layoffs, where executives had been exempt from cost-cutting measures. You can read the full statement below.
For more on the recent wave of layoffs, read about how Sega canceled several upcoming games and how Epic laid off over 800 people.

The majorest of major disclaimers: these early deals aren’t yet subject to the defining rule of Prime Big Deal Days, specifically that its juciest savings will only be for Prime members. In other words, any deals on this list, right now, are available to everyone.

It was revealed early on that the world of Dying Light 2 wasn't going to include guns as such, with the sole exception to this rule being the meagre scrap blunderbuss. At the time, this was a lore-based decision, with the developer Techland choosing instead to focus on the game's melee combat. Yet, an upcoming content update throws this entire explanation into the bin.


Over the next few months, Techland will introduce a surprisingly comprehensive selection of all-new gear and content into Dying Light 2. While the shown-off shotguns and pistols are plenty exciting on their own, players can also expect new missi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the frozen hellscape of Frostpunk, you eked out your existence in hours and days, clinging to your heat- and life-giving generator at the centre of your fledgling city like there was literally no tomorrow. In 11 bit Studio's forthcoming sequel, Frostpunk 2, the apocalypse is yesterday's news. Now you're dealing with "what happens when you survive the un-survivable," as the game's co-director and design director Jakub Stokalski neatly puts it when I sit down for a hands off presentation at this year's Gamescom. And to do this, Frostpunk 2 is going big, measuring its time not in days, but weeks, months and even years.
"If we want to show the evolution of societies and different utopias/dystopias, we need breathing room," says Stokalski. "And this breathing room really is in the scale, both in the physical sense but also in the sense of time. It's difficult to show meaningful social change in the space of a month, so the time ticks now in weeks and months, and in a long playthrough you'll get up into years, so you can see the consequences of your choices."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bilkins' Folly is a throwback pirate adventure game that's out today on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC. It's a game that's been on my radar since earlier this year: both because I love most anything related to pirates and because, well, Bilkins' Folly looks great. Between its visuals, throwback gameplay, nautical tunes, and modern reimaginings of old-school adventure gameplay, it caught my attention. And now it's finally out!
I spoke to developer Webbysoft, who is mostly just one person based in Australia, about Bilkins' Folly ahead of the game's release over email. We discussed the game's inspiration, the challenges of the adventure genre, the game's gibberish language, how the idea of it came from a missing wedding ring, and much more.

Publisher Humble Games has revealed an upcoming 'mini-campaign' DLC expansion for the excellent FPS Prodeus.

We quite enjoyed it, and you can find out why in Game Informer's Payday 3 review. Despite our enjoyment, many players encountered severe matchmaking issues that made it tough to play the game given its always-online nature. Now, just under two weeks after the game's launch, developer Starbeeze Studios says the matchmaking issues are fixed. 
The team has also revealed the game's first update will launch this month. Plus, Starbreeze says more than 3.1 million unique players played the game last month, with the peak concurrent player count hitting 124,254. Starbreeze "will now intensify the commercial activities around Payday 3, after partially pausing these during the previous week," it says, with pla…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Follow the speeder.
Horizon Chase 2 isn't the most interesting racing game out there, but damn, if it isn't hard to put down! It may not match the high-speed hijinks of kart racers starring Mario, Crash Bandicoot, or Sonic the Hedgehog, nor does it hit the same destructive highs of Burnout or the high-fidelity, simulative thrill found in other platforms' exclusive driving games, Forza and Gran Turismo. Instead, you just go fast and feel good doing it. In other words, Horizon Chase 2 is arcade-y fun, and good at pretty much exactly what its title implies, though not much more, and it hits some bumps in the road on Switch.
Like Aquiris' predecessor, Horizon Chase Turbo, Horizon Chase 2 is a throwback to a bygone arcade era; the only thing that matters is that horizon and the finish line that lies somewhere beyond. There's no gimmick or catch. Everything around you becomes a blur as you hit dizzying speeds as you race through low-fidelity courses offering cute renditions of places like Morocco, Japan, the Continental U.S., and Brazil.

Undoubtedly the biggest name heading our way in the next few weeks is Super Mario Bros. Wonder, but October also brings us similarly heavy-hitters like Sonic Superstars and Detective Pikachu Returns as well as gorgeous indies including Wargroove 2 and Dave the Diver.

Ouch. Still, Steam user verdicts are markedly more enthusiastic, and what kind of jaded soul would turn his nose up at a Cluster Shot launcher with bouncing bullets? Bouncing bullets, Matt.

It's time to see how physical sales have fared this week in the UK and, perhaps to nobody's surprise, EA Sports FC 24 has come out on top following its full release on September 29th, 2023.
However, while FC 24 has undoubtedly made a big splash, its overall physical sales are down by 30% compared to FIFA 23, according to GameIndustry.biz's Chris Dring. On the flip side, the Switch version is the only platform to post a slight improvement in sales over the previous title, likely (definitely) because this is the first Switch entry since 2019 not stifled by the atrocious 'Legacy' approach.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Grand Theft Auto is one of the biggest gaming franchises of all time, so it's no surprise that players have been overly eager to hear more about GTA 6. This has resulted in a few controversies, including an arrest following a massive leak. With very little official word from Rockstar, the thirst for GTA 6 information only strengthens. It appears this has driven some fans to desperate measures to find out more about the game.




Twitter user @GTAVInewz recently posted an image presenting a theory which claims we're going to get more GTA 6 news soon. With over half a million views already, it's caught quite a lot of people's attention despite presenting easily irrefutable claims. 


Image via Rockstar.


Does the moon predict the date of the next GTA 6 announcement? 


According to the theory, Rockstar usually announces its games on a Tuesday. Right off the bat, the theory can be debunked, as the image claims that Red Dead Redemption 2 was released on a Tuesday. This is false, as October 26, 2018, fell on a Friday. 




The image then claims that most GTA and RDR games are released in October. The final piece in the puzzle is a recent image posted by Rockstar on Twitter. It features a waning gibbous moon behind the Vinewood sign in GTA 5. We will happen to experience a waning gibbous moon on October 3, leading to the conclusion that a GTA 6 announcement is coming on this day. 


Although amusing, this is definitely not a theory to put your money behind. Even without a GTA 6 announcement, October is set to be a massive month for gaming thanks to the release of several massive games, including Assassin's Creed: Mirage, Spider-Man 2, and Alan Wake 2, to name just a few.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Much to the chagrin of would-be kickers everywhere, Anger Foot was one of Devolver Digital's recently-delayed games. While we may have to wait until 2024 for the full experience, a new Anger Foot trailer is here to show more of the action. See what's going down in Shit City for more of what Free Lives is cooking up for PC.  




We got our first look at the over-the-top gameplay of Anger Foot back in June 2022. Not much has changed since, and the world and enemies look as absurd as ever. As Devolver puts it, "Shit City is a disease and your foot is the cure." That's about as much of a logline as we need. It's very Hotline Miami in 3D with a big-ass boot, from the stylish visuals to the soundtrack.

Kick, shoot, it's all in the mind


The devs are aiming for replayability with secrets and unlocks that let you tackle levels in different ways. These include new sneakers, weapons, and upgradable powers that make it easier to put the boot to the bizarre enemies on the streets. The Anger Foot trailer shows off a few locations, from sewers to run-down apartments. And yeah, enemies definitely won't find any sort of reprieve in the bathroom.  


Despite the extended wait, players have had a chance to check out a demo on Steam. There's still no release date in place, so we'll have to kick it until we find out when it's coming to PC.

With Ghost Trick, the Apollo Justice Trilogy, the Fantasy Life sequel, and the Paper Mario: Thousand-Year Door remake all either announced or released this year, it's almost as if Nintendo is watching me, listening to me go on and on (and on and on and on) about my niche-ish favourite games of all time. Either I'm the luckiest girl and 2023 is just my year, or someone at Nintendo loves me very much.

Now, this genre in particular has gotten a bit saturated in recent years due to the success of Sword Art Online, Log Horizon, and even Ready Player One. However, the art style of the trailer piqued my interest, and the press release indicated SLF would have a bit more of a focus on world-building and game mechanics.

Editor's Note: As described in the text below, a glitch towards the end of Mineko's Night Market prevented us from 100% completing the Switch review build. We're told that the development team is working on fixes, and patches applied pre-launch resolved other issues we initially encountered.
While irritating, the bug didn't affect our enjoyment up to that point, so we're publishing this review based on our time with it prior to that late-game issue (approximately 16 hours). We'll update the review should this problem not be resolved.

If you've been wondering when we'll be seeing more Mortal Kombat 1 reveals, it could potentially be at New York Comic Con 2023 in a few weeks.
In some new posts on social media, the game's director and co-creator Ed Boon mentioned how a new patch would be rolled out early next week. As highlighted by fighting game website EventHubs, fans couldn't help but notice the abbreviation 'NYCC' hidden within this message:

Electronic Arts kicked off its new replacement series EA Sports FC 24 this week and the good news is it's finally delivered a solid experience on the Switch.
It's all thanks to the much-needed Frostbite Engine upgrade which puts the Nintendo version of the game in line with other builds. While the gameplay itself now offers full feature parity with other consoles, you might still be wondering how the Switch release compares to the other next-gen versions in terms of performance and resolution.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of the Realms Deep event, 3D Realms and Voidpoint have announced that the long-awaited expansion to 2019’s Ion Fury, Aftershock, will be released October 2, 2023. Happy Monday!


Ion Fury is a modern game built in Duke Nukem 3D’s legendary Build Engine. In a lot of ways, it’s a spiritual successor to Duke 3D. In fact, it would probably have been a Duke Nukem game if 3D Realms hadn’t handed the character over to Gearbox.


Instead, you play as Shelly “Bombshell” Harrison. The expansion pack has her once again going up against her nemesis, Dr. Heskel. Beyond simply being a map pack, Aftershock adds new enemies, weapons, and a motorcycle for Shelly. Beyond that, there’s also a new difficulty and an “Arrange Mode” for the base game that lets you experience everything again in a remixed way.




Cool beans. I don’t think that Ion Fury is quite as great as Duke Nukem 3D – largely because of a harder-to-manage arsenal and less spectacular level design – but as a spiritual successor, it hit the mark. I mean, I think about it, and I’m like, this could have been Duke Nukem Forever. Instead of the mess we got, they could have given us something like this.


Hopefully, the Aftershock expansion improves things in some appreciable ways. I’m looking forward to it.  Also, note that this is a different game than Phantom Fury. That one is being done by Slipgate Ironworks and is more of a sequel.


Ion Fury: Aftershock releases October 2, 2023. Currently, it’s only for PC with no word on other platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Boomer shooter" is a recent video game genre term used to describe contemporary games that exist as throwbacks to the Doom-inspired era of first-person shooters where speed and firepower are everything. Phantom Fury is not the first game to explore this playground, and it likely won't be the last, but playing the demo left a good first impression. The visuals are cool, the shooting feels good, and protagonist Shelly “Bombshell” Harrison is not afraid to throw out a good one-liner when the mood strikes her.
Phantom Fury is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC sometime this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alientrap, the devs behind Cryptark, are back for more. This time, it's taking its experience with procedural generation and giving it a first-person twist with a sequel titled Gunhead. Described as an "FPS Jetpack Roguelike," the team's latest is now locked in for November 8 on PC and PlayStation 5. The release date was announced today during the Realms Deep digital event. You can see how it looks in action in the new trailer below.




As the preview shows, Alientrap is still all about blasting Mother Brains and other cybernetic monstrosities. The follow-up to Cryptark features procedurally generated starships and over 50 weapons and items to add to your loadout. For those who want to give it a shot, a demo is now live on Steam. 


Let's get ready to cyber-rumble


The setup for Gunhead has players boarding space-hulks and attempting to neutralize them. Doing so will net them more money for their Privateering enterprise. All of the obstacles — from security systems to cyborgs — lead to a battle with the Core. The setup is similar to Cryptark, which had you taking on salvage missions before tackling the massive alien title ship. That one was also procedurally generated, so anyone familiar with Alientrap's previous outing should feel at home here.


Cryptark was fast and frantic, so it looks like that's what they're going for with the sequel. Gunhead promises multiple enemy ship types, and we'll get to see how varied their challenges are when the full game launches.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of the Realms Deep stream, 3D Realms and Slipgate Ironworks have announced a release date for the remaster of Kingpin: Life of Crime. Named Kingpin: Reloaded, it’s set to release on December 5, 2023.


Kingpin: Life of Crime was originally released in 1999 by Interplay. It would prove to be the last game by developer Xatrix Entertainment before much of the staff was transferred to Activision under a studio known as Gray Matter Studios. Xatrix was known for the Redneck Rampage and Cyberia games.




It would largely be overshadowed by the more forward-thinking Half-Life, but Kingpin brought a few innovations of its own. It had side-quests, the Pawn-O-Matic shop system, and a skill system that has you starting off inexperienced with new weapons before gradually building up accuracy.


The remaster seems to essentially be targeting texture fidelity. The muddy filtered textures have been overhauled to look better at higher definitions. However, the wobble of the 3D objects still exists, which I find interesting. That’s not exactly unwelcome and probably the best we can hope for when it comes to the remaster of such a niche title. I’m just always happy to see a game get upgraded for modern systems.


Kingpin: Reloaded is chambered for a December 5, 2023 firing date. PC (via Steam) is the only listed platform.

Over 15 years since its initial release on the Nintendo DS, horror FPS Dementium: The Ward is getting a re-release on the Nintendo Switch eShop, utilising the 2015 3DS remaster as its foundation.
While its creepy low-fi visuals and disturbing creature design have attracted a cult following over the years, Dementium remains a fairly niche title that, until now at least, has been fairly difficult to get hold of since the closure of the 3DS eShop earlier this year.

While there are plenty of surface differences between the franchises, Destiny 2 is built from the same stuff that has kept 40K fans loyal since the 80s. Of course, it's by no means a perfect translation. There are legitimate Warhammer 40K games out there that incorporate actual lore and characters. But if players want to engage in an immersive grimdark future where super-powered protectors of humanity confront galaxy-wide conflict against alien factions and supernatural entities, Destiny is the place to be.


Fans of Warhammer 40K love its dystopian future teeming with warring civilizations and demonic magic. But the whole p…]]></summary>

Following its split with soccer's governing body, EA Sports’ FIFA series is no more, but make no mistake: EA Sports FC is a solid game with a host of welcome improvements. The bones of this longtime franchise remain sturdy and familiar, like a well-run club. The suite of changes to Ultimate Team makes for a satisfying squad overhaul, and manager and player career modes gain smaller, welcome updates. 
Gameplay remains largely the same: solid and familiar. The biggest change is the feel of the ball – it’s loose, with matches te…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gameloft has teased that Frozen and The Little Mermaid are a part of the Disney Speedstorm roadmap over the next four months. Frozen's Arendelle and five new characters from the popular animated franchise will appear this November. 


Later on, four racers from The Little Mermaid will emerge to the surface in January. Additionally, four mystery bonus characters will join mid-season.


Disney Speedstorm just boosted out of the Early Access period and released its 1.0 version. This means that anyone can play the game under its free-to-play model. It's available on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Nintendo Switch, and PC. There's also crossplay and cross-play functionality.




To help celebrate the launch, Gameloft announced its upcoming roadmap. We know that the environments from the undersea Atlantica and frozen tundra around Arendelle will emerge as two locations players will race around in. 


The Disney Speedstorm roadmap also teases that new content will be released every two months.  


As part of Season 4 of the game, Disney fans can now race as Aladdin, Genie, Jasmine, and even Jafar. Four bonus characters, including Hades and Gaston, will be joining the game mid-season as well. The other two are a mystery right now. 


So far, these are the Disney properties included in the game so far:



Mickey and friends


Pirates of the Caribbean


Hercules


Beauty and the Beast


Mulan


Lilo & Stitch


The Jungle Book


Monster's Inc 


Toy Story


Aladdin



Perhaps one day, Gameloft will include Cars' Radiator Springs and 101 Dalmatians' London as race tracks in the future.

For those unaware, Pokemon and Amsterdam's Van Gogh Museum are hosting an in-person collaboration until January 7, 2024. The event launched with Pokemon memorabilia, and purchases included a limited edition promo card.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cyberpunk 2077 is getting another patch just a couple of weeks after the 2.0 update dropped. Despite receiving a slew of gameplay overhauls and bug fixes, it can still be a glitchy game.


CD Projekt Red announced the patch on its website with fixes both platform-specific and across all releases. Most of these aren't large improvements, ranging from adjusting radio songs' volume to properly initiating a glitched gig. One now-fixed bug I experienced is the distorted screen effect not disappearing after the Automatic Love quest.


Two notes are particularly notable as fairly big fixes, though.


The first is a nasty bug that corrupts PS5 saves for exceeding file limits, and the studio's solution is increasing the maximum size for files. Corrupted saves are unfortunately not recoverable, and CDPR recommends you keep a manual save before the corrupted point. 


More so on the side of general improvements, performance should see a bump across all platforms, with upgrades to Dogtown, notably. It's technically an improvement throughout Cyberpunk's world, but Dogtown was highlighted as a notable area where issues occurred. 


The post implies several smaller fixes are also on the way as CD Projekt Red mentions those noted are just the highlights. Another thing missing from the post is a specific release date for the patch other than it's coming soon.


Cyberpunk 2077 is a far more stable release than in 2020, but it's great that CD Projekt Red is still regularly rolling out more fixes. It's not a surprise a content drop as big as Phantom Liberty introduced a few more problems the team is working on fixing. Hopefully, Cyberpunk 2077 will stand as a finely polished RPG by the time it's last fixes release.

According to the posts, new rails will double the number of directions that a rail track can be placed in Factorio. And, with the newest update, rail ramps and supports can create elevated rail systems as well. It may seem like a small change, but it actually really shakes things up for Factorio. Here's a more in-depth look at the changes.

Elevated rails will allow for two layers of rail systems


Once a player utilizes a rail ramp to elevate the rail tracks, supports can further extend the higher-elevation rail. There's only one layer of elevation, so it's not like you can just keep increasing how high…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Mortal Kombat 1 on the horizon, we're revisiting the entry that set the series on its current trajectory: 2011's Mortal Kombat (aka MK 9). Join us today on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. Central as we take a bloody journey through the game's genre-defining story campaign. Episodes will be uploaded to our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel the following Saturday morning. 
After 2006's Mortal Kombat: Armageddon seemingly concluded the franchise's main narrative, 2011's entry picked up the bloody pieces. It moved the saga forward by resetting the timeline, serving as a soft reboot that brought Mortal Kombat back to its 2D fighting roots and ushering in the return of the classic roster. MK 9's cinematic story mode served as an epiphany for the series and fighting games as a whole, establishing the blueprint for narrative fighting campaigns still utilized today. MK9's story also serves as the first chapter of the modern trilogy of games that Mortal Kombat 1 builds upon. For a whole lot more on MK9 and its development, you can read this feature on how the reboot saved the franchise.
Join editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they battle their way through MK 9 to see how its reimagined tournament holds up. 
Part 1 - Surpr-iced! 
Part 2 - Bringing The Smoke
Part 3 - Staff Meeting
Part 4 - My Life As A Lin Kuei Robot

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In another reality, 2003's The Simpsons: Hit & Run — an action-adventure game that was by then the show's 22nd video game adaptation — might have slid quietly into obscurity. So why is it, then, that we can't seem to let it go? On YouTube, the game frequently resurfaces via longplays, speedruns, and retrospective essays that garner respectable amounts of views year after year. A few months ago, the game's lead designer told GamesRadar that he would support an official remake, mentioning that Hit & Run continues to be The Simpsons' most popular video game adaptation on Metacritic.
Yet Hit & Run's sustained relevance is, on its surface, a bit of an enigma. You'd be hard-pressed to find the game included in any critical canons or best-of lists, and there's hardly been a shortage of T-rated open-world games since its release. But for many, the game isn't just a source of nostalgia today; it was an introduction to a wholly new form of in-game self-expression. I looked into the still-growing community keeping it alive today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[FSR 3, AMD’s framerate-roiding answer to DLSS 3 frame generation, is ready to roll in its first supporting games. Great! Except these are currently limited to tedious magic shooters Forspoken and Immortals of Aveum, which is less great. 
Regardless, this could be a major moment for basically any modern graphics card that isn’t an Nvidia RTX 40 series model. FSR 3’s Fluid Motion Frames system works in a broadly similar manner to DLSS 3, piecing together whole new frames outside of the usual GPU rendering pipeline and slipping them onto your screen between the 'real' frames. The result (in theory – I’ll be trying FSR 3 out in depth next week) is higher FPS with no extra strain on your PC, and unlike Nvidia’s frame generation, it doesn’t need any specialist hardware to work.  Therefore older cards, as well as recent AMD GPUs like the RX 7700 XT and RX 7800 XT, could get a new lease of life in games that support it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During the Nintendo Direct the other week, a single game stood head and shoulders above the rest for me. It wasn't Super Mario Wonder (though that does look pretty all right for a 2D Mario game), and it wasn't F-Zero 99 (which I sort of instantly dismissed as a cheap cash-in on that most excellent of neglected Nintendo racing games but have since been told is also quite good). Rather, it was the news that the insta-sit-up-and-pay-attention pairing of Atlus and Vanillaware were making a new fantasy tactics RPG called - wait for it - Unicorn Overlord, and woah nelly, it looks absolutely incredible. Vanillaware games have always been a feast for the eyes - see Muramasa: The Demon Blade on Wii and more recently 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim on PS4 and Switch - and the thought of marrying those lovely visuals with what appears to be a pixel art mash-up of Final Fantasy Tactics and Fire Emblem? Yes please and thank you. 
I was all ready to gush about it in a news post and whack it straight into our release date calendar when I first saw it. But then my heart sank. The press release for it came through, and despite it launching on literally every other console including the Nintendo Switch, PC was not among them. My heart. It was broken.

Phantom Liberty, the expansion released right after update 2.0, makes its combat better in one extra way: by making most of it optional.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oh god, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm trying to fix it. Oh, hello everybody! Welcome to the fourth chapter of the great Starfield no-planets run, in which my character, rancid astro-buccaneer Mary Read, tries to play the entirety of Bethesda's so-big-it's-small RPG in space. When last we caught up with this galloping galactic nuisance, Mary was beginning to lose momentum. She had grown weary of happy-slapping freighter after freighter, though there's one particular wandering geologist she'd like to settle the score with. She had even lost her enthusiasm for boarding actions - the spice in every pirate's cup of grog - having mastered the art of standing at the bottom of a ladder. 


I've spent the past few days trying to cook up a proper endgame objective for Mary - some mad caper befitting a legendary space pirate and her rowdy crew of turncoats and tearaways, who absolutely aren't a bunch of corpses Mary has arranged into sitting postures and decorated with buckets. And in my desperation, I have turned to the forbidden magic of Starfield console commands - a hundred or more deceptively homely lines of text which, when typed into Starfield's in-game console (hit the tilde or @ key), can be used to perform impossible feats, like unlocking all the game's powers or becoming immortal. My initial hope was to solidify the game's weirdly intangible asteroids somehow, and build outposts on them. It's been a couple hours since then, and well, everything has gone awonk. I'm not even playing Starfield anymore. Instead, I am playing a very special, inadvertent Starfield mod of my own devising. Working title: "Totally Fucked".

I've reviewed a half-dozen of their speakers over the years, and each one has been impressive. 
I'm currently recommending Edifier's R2000DB and S3000PRO speakers over at Eurogamer, but today an even more affordable model is on sale at Amazon US: the R1700BTs. These 2.0 bookshelf speakers normally go for $199, but today you can apply a $40 coupon on the product page to bring these speakers down to... $159, if my maths are correct. That's a solid deal for speakers that come with a litany of positive critic and user reviews.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Epic Games has announced it is laying off roughly 16 percent of its workforce, resulting in around 830 employees losing their jobs.
In a statement posted by Epic president Tim Sweeney, he explains the layoffs as a cost-cutting measure that will include divesting Bandcamp, which it acquired last year, and spinning off advertising platform SuperAwesome into an independent company. Epic had acquired SuperAwesome in 2020. 250 people will be leaving Epic as a result of these divestitures. 
“For a while now, we've been spending way more money than we earn, investing in the next evolution of Epic and growing Fortnite as a metaverse-inspired ecosystem for creators,” Sweeney writes in his statement. “I had long been optimistic that we could power through this transition without layoffs, but in retr…]]></summary>

Every spare idle moment I had, I'd be bouncing balls down its infinite planetary mining silos, mesmerised by the vacant stare of its iconic white Holedown worm (my record is still 1090m, in case you're wondering). It's a most joyous day, then (as much as it can be on a day like today), to hear that solo developer Grapefrukt will soon be back with another ball-bouncing beaut in the form of Subpar Pool, which is coming to PC (and phones) on October 12th.

While it might sound complex, the worlds these orbs contain steer you carefully towards a clear goal every time: solve the problem, then grab your orb on the way out. Before you know it, you're carrying orbs within orbs and you're unravelling a cosmic mystery where the floor might be a biomechanical stingray or the path forward a spinal cord composed of ferns. I am convinced everyone should spring to action and hoist an orb on their shoulders. I couldn't put mine down.

The abstract environmental puzzle game has become its own genre in recent years, with some telling stories that are strange but easy to parse and others being so opaque that the player can ascribe almost any meaning to what is transpiring on screen. On this difficult-to-define spectrum, Cocoon lands on the latter half of the scale. I basically never had any idea why I was doing what I was doing or what the larger goal was, but I didn’t mind for a moment because the puzzles scratch your brain so effectively that I was always eager to complete wh…]]></summary>

Gaming franchises need to evolve to stay relevant. Whether it's expanding on certain mechanics or overhauling quality-of-life features, any great series that's been around as long as Bomberman is forced to make changes or be left in the dust. Unfortunately for Super Bomberman R 2, the changes it makes to the formula are mostly unsuccessful. While games with your friends can be thrilling, online play is hit-or-miss, and its story mode is a huge letdown. I respect Konami for trying new things with Bomberman. …]]></summary>

This was the internet as I remembered it, goddamnit, and the fact it mixed in a compelling corporate conspiracy story in between its pages was just the icing on an already fine cake (in GIF form, naturally, with a MIDI tune of Vivaldi's Four Seasons blaring out from your internet browser for good measure). But in revisiting Hypnospace for this month's RPS Game Club, there was one page in particular that really brought the rose-tinted shutters down on me. It was beautiful, lovely April, Hypnospace's virtual pet hamster, who can live, snooze and poop on your desktop, and maybe turn a slightly sickly shade of green if you don't pay enough attention to her.  
As with most things in Hypnospace, I can only assume that April and her fellow gaggle of virtual pet friends are riffs on real-life virtual pet games Catz and Dogz from the late 90s, which, yes, as a ten-year-old girl at the time, I was absolutely obsessed with. Developed by the now defunct PF Magic, Catz and Dogz 3 were arguably two of my most formative PC games growing up, and cor, I miss those dumb beasts so very much.

This time it’s Amazon Prime Big Deal Days, it’s happening this October, and god, I am so, so very tired of writing about these things.
Still, as much as Prime Big Deal Days is sillily named and oddly timed (is Black Friday not just a month later?), it may yet prove useful as a source of cheap PC gaming hardware. Amazon sales usually are, with SSDs, gaming mice, keyboards, and even graphics cards reliably among their discounted wares. Here’s everything we know so far, and some tips for the big day(s) on how to secure the best stuff and avoid shady rip-off tactics.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Owlcat Games has revealed Lord of Nothing, the fifth DLC for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous. It picks up right where the Through the Ashes DLC left off and launches on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC in November. 
More specifically, Lord of Nothing hits consoles and PC on November 21. This DLC takes players to brand new locations, introduces new characters, and tasks players with taking down new foes. It continues the story of Sendri and Rekarth, and where we last saw them in the Through the Ashes DLC, too. 
Check out the Lord of Nothing DLC trailer for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous for yourself below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega, the publisher behind next month's Sonic Superstars, has canceled some unannounced titles in development and Creative Assembly's first-person shooter, Hyenas. The company cites "lower profitability of the European region." 
As a result of the lower profitability, Sega reviewed various in-development projects from its developers in Europe and the result is the cancelation of Hyenas, which just finished up a closed beta on PC less than a week ago, and some other unannounced games. Eurogamer reports that layoffs at Creative Assembly are expected in the wake of this decision. 


"We will implement reduction of various fixed expenses at several group companies in relevant region, centered on the Creative Assembly Ltd.," a Sega press release reads. "We expect to incur one-time expenses related to reduction of fixed expenses. We will continue to consider measures to improve profitability in European bases apart from above. We will announce the specific details and impact from them as soon as we make a decision." 
Sega says as a result of this structural reform, it expects to record losses of approximately 14.3 billion yen for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, but that "there are no changes to the full-year consolidated operating results forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, at this time." 
Sega revealed Hyenas as a first-person multiplayer, multi-team heist shooter experience set in space with a punky comic book aesthetic in 2022. It has been playable in recent closed betas.]]></summary>

Valve’s new/revamped free-to-play FPS sports a range of exotic features and fixtures, from swirlier, reactive smoke to new server architecture, but it has launched without many of the modes, maps and functions Global Offensive diehards are accustomed to, after a decade of updates.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's been a certain amount of confusion and alarm over the announcement of Nakwon: Last Paradise, a dingy third-person zombie survival adventure with a big emphasis on stealth, from the creators of Dave the Diver, a bright, breezy uramaki roll of a game that mixes restaurant management with side-on undersea exploration. Is this kind of like when Prince of Persia went all edgelord with Warrior Within? Do I need to call Mintrocket's parents and ask for an intervention?


Thing is, if you take a step back from each game they're actually very similar. Both are fundamentally about scouring dangerous places for resources and ferrying them back to a safe area where you can sell them off. Both pit you, a mediocre human, against strange and unearthly creatures. Both are sort of about redeeming scenario concepts we all hate - in Dave the Diver's case, the water level, and in Nakwon's case, the stealth mission. See, this is practically a remake! Let's have a look at the trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Announced earlier this year and releasing about four days shy of its promised Summer release window (the first day of Fall was September 23), Counter-Strike 2 is now suddenly available on Steam. You can check out the game's launch trailer below.


The game has been playable in limited test form for some time, and rumors were swirling that the game would release soon, but it is still a surprise to see the game suddenly available on Steam. It has taken over Counter-Strike: Global Offensive's spot on Steam and functions as an update to that game.
Below you will find some details from a press release for the game's official release.
Built on the Source 2 engine, Counter-Strike 2 is modernized with realistic physically-based rendering, state of the art networking, and upgraded Community Workshop tools.
In addition to the classic objective-focused gameplay that Counter-Strike pioneered in 1999, Counter-Strike 2 features:
All-new CS Ratings with the updated Premier mode
Global and Regional leaderboards
Upgraded and overhauled maps
Game-changing dynamic smoke grenades
Tick-rate-independent gameplay
Redesigned visual effects and audio
All items from CS:GO moving forward to CS2

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation head Jim Ryan is leaving the company, according to a press release from Sony Interactive Entertainment. Ryan has served as president and CEO since his appointment in 2018. Ryan’s tenure at Sony spans nearly 30 years, during which he’s held numerous leadership roles, including serving as the head of Sony Europe after former SIEE president Andrew House passed the torch in 2011.
Why Is Jim Ryan Leaving Sony?
"I’ve found it increasingly difficult to reconcile living in Europe and working in North America," Ryan said in the press release. "I will leave having been privileged to work on products that have touched millions of lives across the world; PlayStation will always be part of my life, and I feel more optimistic than ever about the future of SIE. I want to thank Yoshida-san for placing so much trust in me and being an incredibly sensitive and supportive leader."
Ryan remains at the company until March 2024. Effective April 1, 2024, Sony Group Corporation President, COO, and CFO Hiroki Totoki will step in as SIE’s interim CEO, reporting to Sony CEO Kenichiro Yoshida. Effective October 2023, Sony Interactive Entertainment will appoint Totoki as chairman to aid PlayStation ahead of Ryan’s exit.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix announced in 2021 that it was developing an animated Tomb Raider series starring Lara Croft. Shortly after, Netflix revealed that Hayley Atwell, whom you might recognize as Grace from this year's Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning or as Peggy Carter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, would voice Lara Croft in the series. Today, Netflix released our first look at the series, which is called Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft. 
There's no word on when to expect the series, but Netflix says it's coming to the subscription streaming service soon. 
Check out the Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft teaser trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see in the teaser above, this take on Lara Croft seemingly follows the recent Crystal Dynamics Tomb Raider reboot trilogy that concluded with 2018's Shadow of the Tomb Raider. Back in 2021, when Netflix announced Atwell's role in the show, it confirmed the series would take place after the events of that trilogy. Looking at this teaser, it's hard to say whether or not that's the case. But it sounds like we won't have to wait long to find out since Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft is expected to hit Netflix soon. 
In the meantime, check out the teaser trailer for Netflix's Devil May Cry anime series released today as well. In terms of new Tomb Raider games, the first three PlayStation 1 titles are getting remastered next year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix has revealed the first look at its Devil May Cry anime series coming to the subscription streaming service soon. First announced in 2018, it is being developed by Capcom, Studio Mir, and Netflix's Castlevania executive producer Adi Shankar. 
Netflix announced this anime today with a short teaser trailer that gives us our first look at its Dante, who is, of course, escaping a would-be death by sword while firing off bullets from his two trademark pistols. The short snippets of animation we see in the teaser look great, just like Netflix's Castlevania series and its upcoming Castlevania: Nocturne anime, and you can check it out for yourself below: 


Netflix revealed little else about the show although it did call today's teaser a "SSStylish first look." There is no release date for Netflix's Devil May Cry but Netflix says it's coming soon. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's Devil May Cry 5 review and then watch this trailer for Netflix's Castlevania: Nocturne after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation has revealed its October 2023 lineup of free games for PlayStation Plus members and, with it being the month of Halloween, the selections definitely fit the vibe. That's because PlayStation Plus subscribers can add Dead Space spiritual successor, The Callisto Protocol, to their libraries alongside Weird West and the ultra-terrifying Farming Simulator 22. All three games can be added to libraries starting next week on Tuesday, October 3, and players have until Monday, November 6, to do so. 
Below, we've included snippets of what PlayStation has to say about each game alongside our reviews (when applicable): 
The Callisto Protocol 
Game Informer's review
Weird West
Game Informer's review
Farming Simulator 22
Before all three of these games go live for PlayStation Plus members next week, subscribers still have time to add this month's offerings – Saints Row, Black Desert: Traveler Edition, and Generation Zero – to their libraries. 
Are you going to play any of these next month? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

I won't say too much - not in this opening paragraph, anyway - but there's a playfulness to the post-completion options that you don't really find in the rest of Bethesda's much-ballyhooed RPG. It's the kind of thing you expect from modders, not the developers themselves.

Alongside this news, Poncle released a short teaser of what awaits survivors in the Whiteout update, and it looks like a frosty new take on the Vampire Survivors arcade action. Unlike the Tides of the Foscari DLC that was released earlier this year for $2, this Whiteout update will be free on all platforms where you can play Vampire Survivors. 
"It's the first trailer for Whiteout, the new free update we're working on (patch v1.7)," Poncle's announcement tweet reads. "Get ready for a frosty new stage, a new character, weapon, and more. Coming soon to all platforms."

Lego sets represent an ideal, if monstrously expensive, solution. I can build the thing without having to make all the constituent parts of it. I've recently gotten well into the modular city sets, to the extent that I look up discontinued sets on eBay and other such secondhand vendors. I don't actually get sets very often, but last week I built a police station, which can slot next to the bookshop I got for my last birthday. And while the bookshop has cute details - like a book called Moby Brick with a white block leaping from the sea on the cover, and an attic flat with a pet iguana in a glass tank - the copshop has some secret secrets that are the Lego equivalent of leaving a skeleton in a toilet stall. But better.

I got my hands on Alan Wake 2 during a recent preview event, letting me explore two slices of the game as the titular troubled author and FBI agent Saga Anderson. You can read about my experience with Alan’s segment here, but Saga’s side shows plenty of promise and narrative intrigue. 
My demo begins with Saga in the third chapter of her campaign. She arrives in the small town of Watery in search of the Clicker, a serial killer who seemingly has ties to the menacing Cult of the Tree. 
Investigations are Saga’s forte, and I’m tasked with probing Watery’s various …]]></summary>

Lies of P hit PlayStation, Xbox, and PC earlier this month.

The 29-year-old faces a potential prison sentence. While piracy and hacking are no solution,  a survey conducted by the major streaming services themselves shows that affordability is of key importance to most subscribers.

Delightful finds which I feel privileged to have seen. I very much do not have my old floppies. They're all long-gone, chucked along with all my old websites and blogs and CDs and everythings in strict sentimentality purges. I don't know if I now regret that. So with vintage Internet simulator Hypnospace Outlaw being our game of the month in the RPS Game Club, I'm wondering: do you have your old sites and stuff? Dare you share it with us?

It introduces Dualshock 4 and DualSense controller support alongside a host of changes to enemies, the execution of the game’s Fable Arts or gear-specific special moves, item drop rates and the duration of stagger windows. The overarching aim seems to be to make the game easier, and as I’m sure you’re expecting, a few Lies of P fans - and, it turns out, RPS staffers - are ticked off about that.

Earlier this week, SAG-AFTRA union members voted yes to authorize a video game strike. However, the union said it was not yet striking; rather, this strike authorization gave it more leverage at its next bargaining table session where it would try to strike a new Interactive Media Agreement contract with producers and employers.
That negotiation session ended yesterday and SAG-AFTRA and Video Game Employers released a joint statement stating negotiation has concluded but that no deal was reached. 
Here's the joint statement sent to Game Informer, in full:

This is an awesome kit for RAM-intensive applications, like video editing, 3D rendering or scientific computing, and comes at the fraction of the price of even the cheapest 64GB kit of DDR5 (~£150).

More specifically, Banishers will now hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on February 13, 2024. 
As for why, Don't Nod CEO Oskar Guilbert says the team is aiming for a "less saturated period" of video game releases, alluding to the swath of games releasing in the coming weeks, including next month's Assassin's Creed Mirage, Super Mario Bros. Wonder, Marvel's Spider-Man 2, Alan Wake 2, and more (and that's just some of what's releasing in October, which then leads right into November).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On the latest-but-one revision of their About page, Metacritic describe the process of calculating a videogame's aggregate "Metascore" as a kind of "magic". The FAQ cheekily invites you to "peek behind the curtain", evoking the figure of the theatre conjurer beckoning the audience on-stage to inspect the props, before performing the trick. You're only shown so much, however. There are tables for conversions between different review scoring systems, demonstrating how a B- becomes 67/100, but the "weighting" Metacritic gives to each source publication when producing the combined Metascore is a closely-guarded mystery.
You could argue that the secrecy is necessary to avoid heavily weighted publications being targeted and pestered by fans to deliver positive reviews of forthcoming games, so as to swing the average (though in practice, Metascore soothsayers have long since sussed out which outlets have the most votes). But I think it's better understood as a mixture of basic trademark protection and a mechanism of enchantment, a means of both deterring imitators and keeping avid readers guessing about the output. After all, no professional magician seriously wants to give away how the trick is performed, much as no meat magnate wants to show you the inside of a sausage factory.

The Payday series has always entertained using a mixture of competing gameplay mechanics. Going from an engaging yet sometimes confusing heist-based simulation to a chaotic Left 4 Dead-inspired shooter, each title presented a wildly shifting mission structure that encouraged cooperative play. Payday 3 doesn't reinvent the wheel, as it offers many of the same core concepts found in the previous games. That said, some smart design choices and its fresh coat of paint help elevate it above this popular series' previous iterations.

The city feels alive with merchants, townsfolk, guards, palaces, and more. It's vibrant, lively, and, well, looks and sounds like a city. It's painted with hues of desert orange and "Arabian Nights" blue skies, something intentional, according to artistic director Jean-Luc Sala. 
Having lived in the region, Sala says he and his visual team infused many sights he remembers near the Tigris River to bring Baghdad to life. The result is beautiful, if my two hours of hands-on time is any indication. With Mirage meant to serve as an homage to the first Assassin's Creed that started the series in 2007, Sala and the rest of the team at Ubisoft Bordeaux…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CD Projekt have formally commented on the presence of references to the Russia-Ukraine war in Cyberpunk 2077's recently added Ukrainian localisation, apologising for dialogue lines "that can be considered offensive by Russian gamers", while reiterating their support for Ukraine.


In case you missed it, the Ukrainian script and menu localisation currently includes a number of antagonistic references to Russians and to the on-going Russian invasion of Ukraine. One dialogue line refers to a particular bandit group as "rusnia", and there's photo mode menu text for a squatting character that translates as "like a Russian". There's also lore text that apparently riffs on Ukrainian government rhetoric during the war, and a piece of in-game wallart that alludes to the dispute between Ukraine and Russia over Crimea.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy VII: Ever Crisis - a sort of mobile gaming RPG sandwich of the original Final Fantasy VII and its spin-offs Crisis Core and The First Soldier, plus gacha mechanics - is coming to PC and Steam, publisher Square Enix have announced. The Steam release will share data with the mobile version.



Ever Crisis on mobile is a free-to-play game with microtransactions and curvy, colourful chibi-style visuals. It's Final Fantasy: Polly Pocket Edition, sort of. Play breaks down into missions with turn-based battles and brief narrative sequences. The idea is that you can pack in a few minutes of Cloud gaming (no, not that kind) while waiting for your tube. But how will that formula square up on PC, and what to make of the game's reportedly very aggressive microtransaction pop-ups? Fingers crossed they'll rebadge it as a standard pay-upfront release and tear out all the gacha.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[El Paso, Elsewhere feels like the cancelled shooter PS2 adaptation of an incredibly short-lived Image Comics horror series from the mid-90s, leaked by a disgruntled developer over Google Drive more than a decade after the fact. It’s something that would have had a six episode animated series, broadcast out of order at 1am. It’s a testament to that moment in pop culture where the coolest thing imaginable was a tortured guy in a trenchcoat, holding a gun in each hand and fighting monsters. Whether you regard this aesthetic with respect or disgust will help you determine whether there’s anything here for you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been greatly looking forward to Fortune's Run, despite absolutely sucking at the demo. Scandalously, we don't appear to have covered this indie sci-fi FPS on these golden pages, so here's a quick overview: you're the high-jumping, sword-wielding, bullet-pumping lovechild of Deus Ex and DOOM, galloping through a world that recalls the Imperial bases and sewers of Dark Forces, taking down grungy pixelart sprites by means of precision parries, grabs, combos, headshots, terrain traps and much more besides. Between dust-ups, you can play basketball and leave crayon graffiti for other players care of a Dark Souls-style messaging system. It's a feast!


The game was due to launch into Steam early access tomorrow, 27th September, but unfortunately, there's been a delay. Valve's testers have denied Fortune's Run approval to launch on the platform. Among the reasons, according to developer Team Fortune themselves, is that Valve don't feel the game's content warning for sexual assault is actually necessary.

Said commenters might be tickled to know that there is, in fact, a puddle in the game's Akila City that contains infinite loot: by dint of peering into it, you'll magically gain access to a nearby store's inventory. Strip the shelves, then wait a day or two, and you'll be able to do so again, forever and ever.
Or at least, that was the case till this week's Starfield patch, a small update consisting of exactly ten bulletpoints, including one that tackles "an issue that allowed for a vendor's full inventory to be accessible". Boo! Time to go looking for another convenient in-game metaphor, I guess. Perhaps there's something incredibly clever you can say about all the flying cities.

I haven't touched Cyberpunk since release in 2020, and I'm sort of intrigued to discover that the female-presenting version of the protagonist, voiced by Cherami Leigh, has become the default for marketing purposes.

        <link href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/minekos-night-market-review"/>
        <updated>2023-09-25T16:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[About a third of the way through Mineko's Night Market, a young boy dressed as a fish says to his octopus-chopping father, "What? I just thought sending the local errand kid on missions was how people acquired stuff on this island." To many, this will simply be a comic jibe at what you, the aforementioned local errand kid, have been doing for the last eight hours or so. After moving to this rural backwater with your dad in search of a better life, you quickly realise that no one in this town ever gets off their arse to get anything done.
Instead, it's up to you, Mineko, to fulfil every last one of their desires, whether it's collecting 50 bits of wood so they can construct a frame for their new house (before asking you for 50 bits of paper to give it some flimsy-looking walls), buying and delivering them a sports drink they could have easily got themselves from the local shop, or crafting a flower box for them because, well, they asked you to. As I said, industry isn't exactly their strong suit here, and you'd be forgiven for wondering how any of them functioned as human beings before you arrived.
But this line of dialogue also strikes right at the heart of what a joyless experience Mineko's Night Market is. It reveals the cold, lifeless husk beneath its lovely visuals. It's nothing but 'Me, me, me' and 'Take, take, take' in this game, and NPCs offer nothing in return except soul-crushing tedium and a long list of repetitive chores. Animal Crossing this is not, my friends, so don't be fooled. This is about as far from 'cosy' and 'cute' as you can possibly get - and that's despite it having dozens of pet-able cats.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty is, according to our reviewer Graham, "perhaps the best expansion pack ever made." Feh, small potatoes – Phantom Liberty’s most prestigious achievement is surely how it heralds a new ray tracing feature that makes Cyberpunk 2077 look and run a tiny bit better. On specific settings. And only on GeForce RTX graphics cards. The more expensive ones.
Hello, then, to DLSS 3.5 and its Ray Reconstruction component. Like how DLSS improves visuals and performance with AI-aided upscaling and ant-aliasing, Ray Reconstruction injects some machine learning cleverness into the rendering of ray tracing. Nvidia say Ray Reconstruction cleans up artefacts and reduces the performance impact of RT effects, and judging by how it works in Cyberpunk 2077, I’d say they’re correct – with the caveat that all its enhancements are, ultimately, modest.

My favourite used to be "sunsetting", aka cancelling a live service game, aka "we dragged the servers outside and smashed them with bats, gangland style". But now there's a new front-runner, "simmering". You know what's simmering? Quantic Dream's Star Wars: Eclipse, that's what. "Can I say it still exists? Because it exists," the developer's vice-president of marketing Lisa Pendse has revealed in a new interview from this year's Tokyo Game Show. "It's just not ready. It's simmering." Hmm.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hypnospace Outlaw used to be a very different type of game than the one we know today. The authentic replica of the world wide web circa 1999 was originally designed to be little more than ornate level select screens in a stylish endless runner-style game, for example, providing extra context for your adventures pursuing "outlaws on the Hypnospace Highway". 
Games change during development, of course, and it’s not unusual for once substantial ideas to be left on the cutting room floor. But seeing as Hypnospace Outlaw is our pick for the RPS Game Club this month, I wanted to reach out to the game’s creator Jay Tholen to ask some questions about these unlikely origins, its influences and its lasting legacy. What happened to the Hypnospace Highway? And what comes next for the world of Hypnospace?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reworked skill trees and new minigames aside, Cyberpunk 2077's 2.0 update includes a Ukrainian localisation of the game's million-plus-word script. It turns out the Ukrainian version is awash with references to Russia's on-going invasion of Ukraine, all of it seemingly in support of the latter. The news comes via Zone of Games, who have published a few side-by-side comparisons from the game's files, underlining differences between the English and Ukrainian translations in various bits of dialogue and menu text.
I asked the organisers of Indie Cup - a Kyiv, Ukraine-based digital festival of games like Pahris Entertainment's upcoming Space Wreck - to help me double-check the Ukrainian version's alterations. The Indie Cup team's Arsenii Tarasov was happy to oblige, and also volunteered a few further examples of more... adventurous localisation from his own research, supported with screenshots.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hideki Kamiya is leaving Platinum Games next month. Kamiya co-founded the Osaka, Japan-based studio in 2006 and later went on to direct games like Bayonetta and The Wonderful 101. His final day at Platinum will be October 12, according to both a statement released by the studio and Kamiya on his personal Twitter account. 
As for why, neither Platinum's statement nor Kamiya's own tweets indicate a specific reason. Platinum thanks Kamiya for his work while stating it looks forward to seeing what he does next, while Kamiya notes that the decision to leave was not an easy one but he feels it's for the best. 
Here's Platinum's statement:

September 25, 2023
And here's what Kamiya tweeted today about his upcoming departure: 
However, I feel this outcome is for the best.
September 25, 2023
Before co-founding Platinum in February of 2006, Kamiya worked on Capcom's Resident Evil series, helping plan the first game and directing its sequel, as well as its Devil May Cry series. He also directed the first Viewtiful Joe game, and then Okami in 2006 at Capcom's Clover Studio. Capcom closed Clover later that year but Platinum had already been somewhat founded under the name Seeds, Inc. It was later renamed Platinum Games and the rest was history. 
Kamiya departs from Platinum more than 17 years after he founded it alongside Shinji Mikami, who is no longer there and departed from Tango Gameworks earlier this year, and Atsushi Inaba, who is the studio's CEO.
While waiting to learn what Kamiya is up to next, read Game Informer's review of Bayonetta and then check out our thoughts on The Wonderful 101. Read Game Informer's Bayonetta 3 review after that and then read our review of Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dark Side, the exciting sequel of the groundbreaking Driller, is ready for public testing!
Dark Side, like its predecessor, was released by Incentive Software Limited in 1988, shortly after Driller. The updated gameplay features a jetpack that allows you to leave the ground, providing a new and fresh perspective that emphasizes the excitement and challenges of exploring Tricuspid, the second alien moon of planet Evath.
This time, the vicious Ketars have scattered and hidden Energy Collection Devices (ECD) around their base to destroy your home planet. It’s up to you to destroy them first! The tricky part is many ECDs are connected to each other and can regenerate instantly, so you must figure out the right order to successfully complete your mission. 
Our reimplementation of the Freescape engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Dark Side support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC. Additionally, there are two playable demos if you want to test the game. Support for Amiga and AtariST will be available later! Please contact us if you have some other release.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.

Javier Tebas said in the first five days of the new season, LaLiga 'eliminated" 58 pirate apps with over a million downloads in Spain. He said that LaLiga is now talking to Google about "locating" the apps already downloaded on users' phones so they too can be "eliminated". If it can be done for child abuse images, then it can be done for piracy tools too, Tebas said.

To reduce piracy, Google accepts DMCA takedown notices for URLs that don't yet exist in its indexes. So what happens if you receive a 'future piracy' notice that's clearly bogus? A DMCA counter notice won't work; they're talking about things you haven't even done yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tales of the Shire is a cozy new game set in The Lord of the Rings universe and it's coming out sometime next year. Developed by Wētā Workshop, the New Zealand-based special effects and props company that worked on Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings movie trilogy, and published by Private Division, Tales of the Shire promises to let players live their best cozy Hobbit life. 
Private Division revealed little about the game with its announcement yesterday, although it did release a teaser trailer that captures the vibes of living on The Shire. Check out the Tales of the Shire teaser trailer for yourself below: 


"Your cosy Hobbit life awaits in Tales of the Shire, a heart-warming new Lord of the Rings game by Wētā Workshop and Private Division," the teaser's YouTube description reads. "Coming 2024." 
And that's all we know about the game. Here's hoping we learn more soon because it sounds like a great premise. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's review of The Lord of the Rings: Gollum.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last month, Microsoft submitted a new deal to the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority regulatory agency that proposes Ubisoft get the rights to Activision Blizzard game streaming for 15 years. Microsoft did this to get its acquisition of Activision Blizzard approved by the CMA after the regulator previously blocked it over cloud gaming concerns. One month later, the CMA has granted preliminary approval to Microsoft due to its new Ubisoft deal. 
The CMA says it has "identified limited residual concerns with the new deal" but that Microsoft has put forward remedies (see: Ubisoft's role) that the CMA "has provisionally concluded should address these issues." The CMA is now consulting on those remedies before making a final official decision ahead of the October 18 deadline to do so.

Since Lars Sundström, aka lman, joined our team as the iOS porter, we have made significant progress. Thus, you no longer need to compile ScummVM yourself in order to add it to your iOS or iPadOS device. 
If you want to help by testing this version, just follow this Testflight link and enroll yourself in the test program. This may require installing Apple’s Testflight app. You can find instructions on how to install games and how to play them on our documentation portal.
We truly appreciate your feedback. You can share your thoughts with the Testflight feedback feature, where you can attach screenshots and post detailed descriptions. Alternatively, you can use our bugtracker, e-mail us at ios@scummvm.org, or post on our Discord Server. Your help will let us eventually add ScummVM to the App Store.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following our announcement about affiliation with ZOOM-Platform, we would like to give a note that they have just started to offer the Macintosh versions of  Syberia 1 and Syberia 2 bundled with ScummVM.
This is important because ScummVM currently supports only the Macintosh versions of these games. These versions were produced by Tetraedge and are built on a completely different engine than the original Windows versions; basically, they are reimplementations, not ports. Now, thanks to the folks from ZOOM-Platform, you can easily obtain these game variants.
