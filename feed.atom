        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bioware released a statement yesterday. It talked of "turning towards the future". It dreamed of "a more agile, focused studio". Nowhere in the post did the word "layoffs" appear. But this is what the post was actually about. The closest it got to addressing the facts of what happened to an unspecified number of workers is the phrase: "we don’t require support from the full studio." 
It's one of the most disingenuous announcements of job cuts in a recent and plentiful history of job cuts. A weirdly impressive feat from BioWare, considering the last two or three years have seen some spectacular verbal gymnastics from games companies when it comes to shitcanning people. Let's take a look at some of our "favourite" mealy-mouthed press releases in which people have their jobs poetically "sunsetted" rather than, say, dropkicked out the window.

Hello Kitty Island Adventure released on Apple Arcade in July 2023 to generally positive reviews. A year and a half later, the Switch release brings a charming cast of Sanrio characters and their island resort to a wider audience—an audience ultimately in for a good time.
Hello Kitty Island Adventure opens on a plane en route to a mysterious resort with lots of familiar faces from the Sanrio franchise on board. After creating an animal avatar of our own (a moody purple bunny), we soon found ourselves jumping out of the plane and gliding to the ground with a handful of balloons. We get our first major quest shortly after touching down: find everyone who was scattered across the island during the descent.

Upon entering, you'll find several doors you need to activate to reach the top floor and advance through the Re-Haunt the Spooky Swamp quest. 


Although this goal sounds simple, you'll instantly find a peculiar quest objective titled "Survive the Haunted Mansion." In short, you need to solve puzzles within ten rooms to light up their respective lights. Here's how to complete all ten haunted mansion rooms in Hello Kitty Island Adventure.

Although this world of Hello Kitty and her friends only recently entered my life, I have several friends and family who adore these guys. I've lost count of how many times my own siblings have mentioned Hello Kitty, Kuromi, or Cinnamoroll in random conversations throughout the years.


For me, this was a blind playthrough of Hello Kitty Island Adventure. Although I'd known about the Apple Arcade version through several friends, I'd never played it myself, making this a fresh start rather than a direct comparison. I mainly thought the characters were cute, but playing this has since made me develop an unexpected appreciation for them and the Sanrio universe, leaving me completely satisfied for a while.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[More good news in the world of tardy translations, Ratalaika Games and Shinyuden are localizing Technos Japan’s 1991 dice-centric Famicom RPG, Sugoro Quest: Dice Heroes. It’s coming February 7 to Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.


It’s interesting news coming in the wake of Super Technos World: River City & Arcade Classics, as it will feature the Super Famicom’s Sugoro Quest++: DICENICS, but won’t be providing a translation. I’m not sure if this news makes that more disappointing or less. At least now we’re getting some Sugoro Quest and not none.


Sugoro Quest is something of a cross between a board game and a JRPG. The game world is a series of segmented paths that you roll to traverse. Fights also have you pit your dice against those thrown by enemies. Whoever gets the highest number gets to attack. Somewhat like an actual tabletop RPG. Sort of. Some of them. Maybe.


Was it any good? I’m not sure, personally. I’ve heard good things and have wanted to try it myself, if only because I’m a fan of Technos’ Famicom output. I was a bit bummed that Sugoro Quest++ isn’t being translated in the Super Technos World collection, but I also understand that translating old games isn’t as easy as it sounds, which is why you should appreciate each and every fan effort.


At the same time, new official translations are becoming more common, and it’s great to see. Not only are we getting games like the Shockman series from Ratalaika and Sinyuden, but there are official cartridge releases from folks like Retro-Bit, collections from Arc Systems Works (Sugoro Quest++ aside), and even Nintendo got in on it with their limited-time re-release of the first Fire Emblem game. Great stuff.


Sugoro Quest: Dice Heroes is coming to Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S on February 7, 2025 (thanks to Gematsu for spotting it).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA FC 25 players might be busy with the Team of the Year promo as of writing, but the Future Stars promo is expected to be available soon in Ultimate Team.


If leaks are to be believed, Future Stars will be the next promo and the potential successor for the TOTY celebrations. Of course, Future Stars will be a returning campaign, as it was available in EA FC 24 as well. So far, EA Sports has remained tight-lipped about their plans, but certain cards have already been leaked.


All EA FC 25 Future Stars promo players (leaks)


It appears that EA Sports will be following last year's structure with the Future Stars promo. In simpler words, there will be special cards for both active footballers and former legends. The leaks, as of writing, might be limited, but some interesting names have already popped up.



Lamine Yamal


Xabi Alonso CDM 91


Lucas Beraldo


Johann Cruyff


Endrick


Emilio Butragueno


Leny Yoro



Out of all the cards leaked so far, we have confirmation about Alonso's overall rating and potential. Details about the remaining leaks are unavailable at the time of writing. They will be updated once we have more information in the lead-up to the release.


EA FC 25 Future Stars promo release date


The TOTY cards are going to be available in packs till Friday, January 31. That's the same day the Future Stars promo is expected to go live in Ultimate Team. The new cards will be available in packs, and it's safe to expect some of the items to be made available via objectives and SBCs.


So far, we have no confirmation about whether Future Stars will be a one-week or two-week-long promo. It will also be interesting to find out if EA Sports will reintroduce the Academy Stars Evolution. Last year, we were able to upgrade six different items of our choice with massive upgrades. It will certainly be a cool addition for those who miss out on getting a TOTY item.

Unlike when the 'Mythical Island' mini-expansion dropped late last year, the arrival of 'Space-Time Smackdown' has pushed the original 'Genetic Apex' set off the TCG Pocket home screen. In fact, when you first open up the app now, Charizard, Mewtwo and Pikachu are nowhere to be seen, replaced by the new Dialga and Palkia art and the Mew addition.

Most of the Cursed Tools in Jujutsu Infinite usually require you to complete certain tasks. To get the Ravenous Axe, you'll have to complete the Numa Temple Set missions or the Kura Camp missions.

One of the ‘what ifs’ comes in the form of the ‘Nintendo PlayStation’, and it really is a rabbit hole of a story. 


It’s jarring, isn’t it? To see the Super Nintendo controller with the PlayStation branding that we’ve now all come to know so well. How did it get there, and why? Here’s everything you could ever want to know about the sordid tale of the doomed Nintendo PlayStation.

A number of Dragon Age: The Veilguard staff are leaving the celebrated RPG company in the course of plans to become "a more agile, focused studio", as BioWare move ahead with the next Mass Effect game. Posting on Bluesky, senior systems designer Michelle Flamm, producer Jen Cheverie, editor Karin West-Weekes, lead writer Trick Weekes and narrative designer Ryan Cormier have all announced that they're looking for work.


All of which feels like it warrants a mention in general manager Gary McKay's recent blog about BioWare's future, but he comments only that they're "taking the opportunity to reimagine" how BioWare operate between projects, and "have worked diligently over the past few months to match many of our colleagues with other teams at EA that had open roles that were a strong fit." Which is a very slippery way to say that you're making a load of people redundant.

Nintendo has announced that the Japanese Switch eShop will soon no longer accept overseas credit cards or PayPal accounts as valid payment methods.
As reported by VGC, the change will come into effect from 25th March 2025, with Nintendo citing "fraudulent use" as a main contributing factor behind the decision. It has not elaborated beyond this, but it's well-known at this point that many overseas Switch owners like to utilise the Japanese eShop for games that either aren't available elsewhere, or perhaps might be cheaper than their regional equivalent.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a hot minute since we've had a new Mass Effect release, not including the Legendary Edition that came out in 2021. There is a follow-up in development, but a recent post suggests the studio may be downsizing, or is at least restructuring.


According to Gary McCay – the current General Manager at BioWare – the next entry in Mass Effect will be handled by a "core team" going forward. It seems as though developers who worked on Dragon Age: The Vailguard are being moved over to the new project.




This information follows an announcement from August 2023 that said the company would be "changing how we build games to meet the needs of our upcoming projects and hold ourselves to the highest quality standards."


Carefully chosen language


McCay goes on to say that BioWare is "taking this opportunity between full development cycles to reimagine" how the team works. As such, the upcoming Mass Effect game doesn't require support from "the full studio."


Do note that at no point does the blog post say that BioWare is actually initiating layoffs or terminating roles at the company. However, the language employed does seem to skirt around this. In fact, a report from IGN, some people at the company have been relocated to other roles.


This also seems to include those who worked on the recent Dragon Age game. The report claims that "team members are also seeing their roles terminated" while also being offered new jobs internally. Given this, it does sound like BioWare is indeed restructuring in a way that will affect those who are already working at the studio.


As for the new Mass Effect, we don't have much information to go off at this stage. At the time it was announced a few years ago, it was in the early stages of development, but McCay's post suggests the project is about to become the focus of BioWare.

The post Mass Effect 5 won’t have ‘support from the full studio,’ as BioWare restructures appeared first on Destructoid.]]></summary>

Happily, all these ray tracing and frame generation accoutrements seemingly won’t preclude Spidey 2 from working on older, slower PCs as well, as the minimum specs are surprisingly reasonable.
Granted, they’re only rated for 30fps at a lowly 720p, and you’ll still need to find a honking 140GB of SSD space, but the basic GPU and CPU requirements aren’t too lofty at all. The likes of an RTX 3060 for 60fps/1080p are quite reasonable as well, though you’re staring down the barrel of Nvidia’s pricey RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 cards for high-rez ray tracing.

"An account for PlayStation Network will become optional for these titles on PC," said PlayStation in a short and quiet blog post that includes the upcoming PC release for Spider-Man 2, and The Last Of Us Part II. It's been eight months since PlayStation provoked mass annoyance among PC players by making a PSN account mandatory to play Helldivers 2, and later Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered. They soon walked back the decision for Helldivers 2 after a rough review-bombing but the company didn't seem to fully take the hint. It looks like they've now conceded that, yes, the obligatory sign-up was an unpopular move.

Komi Can't Communicate, penned by Tomohito Oda, debuted on Shogakukan's Weekly Shonen Sunday magazine in May 2016. The manga ended with Chapter 499, which is available in English on VIZ Media. While the manga released weekly chapters via Weekly Shonen Sunday, the chapters are compiled into 36 tankobon volumes, though the final chapters are yet to be included.

Capcom has released its financial results for the nine months ended 31st December 2024 in FY2025 (thanks, GamesIndustry). In short, though net sales and net income are both down year-on-year, the company states that the results are currently "in-line" with its fiscal plan.
Net sales fell by 16.3% to ¥88.9 billion ($572.7 million), while net income fell by 33% to ¥23 billion ($148.2 million). One of the major contributing factors for this is the simple reason that Capcom has been unable to enjoy the boost in revenue that Street Fighter 6 provided the previous fiscal year.

Between spring and fall of 2024, illegal subscriptions increased by a record 25%, with an estimated 700,000 households now regularly paying to pirate. The government considers a 'viewing ban' for citizens but, there appears to be no clear idea how or even if that would work.

Following successful funding on Kickstarter, the turn-based tactical strategy game Warside has finally locked in a release date. It will launch for Switch and multiple other platforms on 28th January 2025.
In case you missed our existing coverage of this one, as you can see, it's heavily inspired by a certain Nintendo series. The developer previously mentioned how it felt it could "evolve" the genre and was happy to cite not only Advance Wars but also series like Wargroove and Into The Breach as inspirations.

        <updated>2025-01-30T00:07:48.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Folks looking for another promising roguelite action game to sink some time into can now mark their calendars for this spring. Game Source Entertainment locked in an April 24 launch date for Yasha: Legends of the Demon Blade, a stylish-looking actioner that's on the way to PlayStation 4/5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC.


Taiwanese indie developer 7Quark is behind the action-RPG, which unfurls its take on the story of the Nine-Tailed Fox in Edo era Japan. Also known as the "King of Demons," the beast's arrival upsets the previously-established peace between humans and demons. As one might expect, that serves as a nice excuse for some fast-paced hackin' and slashin'.


You can see some of that in action along with a look at the main characters in the new trailer:




The three main characters each have notable Japanese voice talent behind them. Yoko Hikasa (Minami in Dr. STONE) voices the Demon Blade-wielding immortal ninja known as Shigure. Ayana Taketatsu (Leafa in Sword Art Online) voices Oni Emissary Sara, and Rikiya Koyama (Taiga Saejima in Yakuza/Like a Dragon) voices demon samurai and master archer Taketora. 


Throughout the adventure, weapons can be upgraded, recipes can be discovered, and alliances can be forged with "kind-hearted demons." Uh huh, we've heard that one before. Nice try, demons. 


For those who want to check it out before it drops this April, a demo is currently available on Steam. It's billed as an "evolving demo," so more is on the way in the future. As of right now, Steam Next Fest is the next approaching milestone. Look for the first half of Chapter One, new seasonal scenery, new enemies, and a new boss stage to be added to the sampler platter soon.

As opposed to the Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game or Official Card Game formats, which receive updates to their Forbidden & Limited Lists every few months, Master Duel sees updates to its list about once a month. These frequent lists are often used to micro-adjust the metagame and test to see what's actually working. The list that goes into effect on February 5th, 2025 follows that example, but with a few big changes.

BO6 'join failed because you are on a different version' error solutions


The BO6 'different version' error appears whenever you're trying to join a party. Standard fixes like restarting your game or installing a new patch don't seem to address it, but fortunately, players have discovered a few workarounds with these methods:

While the system was designed with two players in mind, the limitations of the hardware threw up a lot of obstacles, and there was never an elegant way around them. Elegance is overrated.


So, while multiplayer was better in arcades and would only start catching up in later generations, anyone who experienced the console in its prime probably has some great memories of sharing the unit with a chum. So, if you’re looking to recapture that feeling, or if you’re new to the console and want to explore it with a friend, then I’ve got some picks for you, in no particular order.

In all honesty, we've been thinking about this for years, arguably since before we knew that Mario Kart 8 would be getting a Deluxe reprieve and assumed the new hotness on Switch would be totally new.

That said, this is the precise extent of the things you can do in the game so far. Build 'n' crash. Every feature fits in this opening paragraph.

Atomic apocalypse? Ehhh. That's a roadside picnic compared to what S.T.A.L.K.S this alternately Lynchian and Tarkovskian battlefield. You'll wish you'd been dusted by nuclear fire when you're being torn open by some kind of demon puppet in a labyrinth of red curtains.


If you do get torn open by a demon puppet, the good news is that players have a range of artificial bodies to choose from. Among Phantom Line's headline features is the HUSK system, which lets you switch between members of your squad right in the middle of combat. Unless, presumably, the body in question is already occupied by one of your co-op partners. If all this sounds appealing, the even-gooder news is that there's now a demo available via the developer Discord.

The first prison escape board game that instantly comes to my mind is “Prison Break”, based on the hit TV show of the same name, which aired between 2006 and 2017. However, for some bizarre reason, the Prison Break board game was only ever released in French, and I’m hedging my bets that you’re looking for something more English to play. 


If that’s the case, here are 10 alternative board games that will have you fleeing captivity in one way or another.

Or can you? News comes via Nic himself that modder FrancisLouis, whose previous works include performance-enhancing rejigs of various games (and one that turns the Silent Hill 2 remake’s pipe weapon into a rigid, A-posing wife), has produced Fantasy Optimizer: an overhaul of how FF7 Rebirth handles shaders and streamed visuals.

What is Piranhado in Diablo 4?


As stated earlier, Piranhado is a new Witchcraft power that you can use in Season 7 of Diablo 4. It pairs with powers that cast both Hex and Auras, grouping enemies together and dealing damage over time.


The more you level it up, the longer duration it has and more damage it does. In short, it’s a CC ability that groups enemies together when meeting certain conditions.


Is Piranhado good?

To get Indira’s Memory in Diablo 4, you can either test your luck by playing the typical Nightmare Dungeons, Infernal Hordes, Undercity, and other modes, or you can target-farm it by defeating The Beast in the Ice.


You’ll also want to be playing on your Necromancer to ensure that this item will drop. While you can get other class items while playing different characters via the Undercity, it’s best to stick to that specific role.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Antistatic Studios has announced that a demo playtest of their four-player cooperative FPS, Phantom Line, is now available on PC via their Discord server. Alongside this is a new trailer to give you a peek at what you’re getting into.


It’s a bit hard to get a good read on what Phantom Line really is, so let’s start from the top. It’s a first-person shooter for 1-4 players, set in an open-world environment. You’re an operative for a megacorporation who has been dispatched into an Eastern European country following a nuclear war. Okay, sounds familiar.




However, there’s also something called the H.U.S.K. that allows you to transfer your consciousness between artificial bodies. The trailer doesn’t really capture that very well, but there’s a gif on the store page that shows it in action. Maybe.


Phantom Line promises an open world full of dynamic events. You and your friends get a derelict ship as a base of operations and can show off your loot. There’s also crafting, because an artificial army runs on its stomach, so you have to eat. The trailer shows a suspicious amount of bear violence, so you may be eating something pretty gamey.


To get in on the Phantom Line playtest, you’ll need to sign up for their discord at this link here. The full release date has yet to be announced.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Has any genus of graphics card been as dramatically storied as the GeForce XX80s? The RTX 3080 was a thing of beauty, only to be tarnished by the worst wheeler-dealing spree (and crypto mining misappropriation) in PC component history. Then the RTX 4080 rocked up with its laughable £1269 / $1199 price tag, a miscalculation so severe that the RTX 4080 Super looked good – despite hardly being any faster – simply for not repeating it. For the new RTX 5080’s sake, you almost want it to be boring.
It isn’t. But then, neither is it a blood-boiler like the RTX 4080, nor a largely aspirational show-off piece like the RTX 5090. By maintaining the 4080 Super’s course correction on price while tooling up on compelling DLSS 4 improvements, the RTX 5080 is an agreeable GPU from the off. Particularly, if you’ve got the 4K monitor to take full advantage of it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lookin' good!
Can you believe it's been nearly 14 years since Super Mario 3D Land launched on the 3DS? Yeah, it's making us feel pretty old too, don't worry.
With no sign of a potential Switch port in the immediate future, we'll have to make do with the original 3DS version for now, but fear not, because a modder by the name of Cyboo has launched a new mod that might just extend your enjoyment that little bit more (provided you have the means to access it, of course).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One that shouldn't be mist.
A few years ago, developers Adglobe and Live Wire (which, fun fact, also developed Harvestella) released a Metroidvania called Ender Lilies: Quietus of the Knights to high praise. Combining a heavy atmosphere with tough, Soulslike combat in a dark fantasy world, it stood out as a notably quality addition to a genre that feels like it gets at least one new entry every week. The sequel, Ender Magnolia: Bloom in the mist, is a strong iteration on its predecessor's formula. It's everything a Metroidvania should be and, even if it’s not exactly revolutionary, it executes its vision well.
Ender Magnolia is set a number of years after Ender Lilies, placing you in the role of Lilac, a young girl who awakens from a long slumber in a strange and decaying world. What’s left of society is occupied by two different races: humans and the creepy machines called Homunculi. Some Homunculi could easily pass as human while others have much more monstrous or animalistic traits, and all are susceptible to corruption from a mysterious mist called fumes. Luckily, Lilac happens to be an Attuner—someone who can directly purify corrupted Homunculi—so you set out on a journey to uncover her lost memories and do what you can to set the world straight.

We really should have seen this coming, but as reported by our pals over at VGC, tickets for the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 Experience hands-on event are being listed on eBay.
With Nintendo providing confirmation to prospective attendees over the last couple of days, it's become clear that those who have been unsuccessful in their application far outweigh those who have been successful (check out our recent poll for a little taste on how heavily skewed the votes are).

Which is to say, somebody's finally made a video game version of Hex, the sentient glass hive from Terry Pratchett's Unseen University. In spooky automation-driven strategy sim Microtopia, you manage a swarm of what could either be ants who've been to the ripperdoc, or PC components who've grown legs and antennae. Your goal is to expand an insect colony that is also a motherboard, where glittering pheromone trails double as silicon circuits.
The developers Cordyceps Collective have just announced a release date - February 18th - and what's this, there's a demo as well? Catch the trailer below.

You may or may not find all that "soothing" - I won't judge. I will only repeat Nic's observation from the Maw that Sniper At Work look "a bit like Commandos, a bit like Hitman", which I would translate to "my comrade in PC gaming, if historic audience trends are any indication you shall do well here".

Given the scope of the allegations, narrowly focused on a single defendant, the action seems unusually punitive. Yet if the plan was to push Keighin into a corner, the Colorado resident hasn't read the script. Allegations of destruction of evidence, obstructing service, and abuse of Nintendo's legal team, combine to make a dire situation even worse. But not for Nintendo.

Donkey Kong Country Returns HD swung onto Switch earlier this month and it's a perfectly good time. Nothing we haven't seen before, but still a good bit of fun. That is unless you want to play some of the later stages in co-op, it seems, because fans have discovered an oversight that sucks all the fun out of platforming with your pals (thanks for the heads up, GamingReinvented).
As shared on YouTube by the wonderfully named DK fan channel, Kong Kompendium, Returns HD has a problem with its co-op combat: two players can't bounce off the same enemy. It might not sound that weird on paper (heck, Mario does it all the time), but such an ability becomes pretty crucial as you progress into the game's later stages — where bouncing on enemies is the only way to proceed — making a full co-op run on Switch far from ideal.

Here, the open-world RPG ostensibly improves its arguably disappointing technical performance and presentation issues on console by way of more powerful CPU and GPU combos…

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In regular Darkest Dungeon 2, your mind, body and soul are fixed upon the points of a horrible mountain, looming over the inn at the end of every foetid wagon ride. It's sort of Journey for plague doctors, or possibly The Hobbit: Cosmodick Turpin Edition. I enjoy feeling the weight of those distant peaks upon my brain and eyeballs, but it's nice to fire up Kingdoms, the new free DD2 game mode that's launched just today, and have a choice of disasters to trundle toward.  


Over here is an inn being overrun by slathering beastmen. Over there is another, safer inn, but it's inconveniently perched behind a nest of tentacular cultists. In the middle there is you, with the customary DD party of half-dead, half-mad adventurers, equipped with an exciting smorgasbord of sharp edges, cursed artefacts, phobias and diseases. Let us proceed laughing and wailing to the launch trailer.

They're letting 185 people go across their European operations, and will be closing UK-based Ubisoft Leamington, whose recent projects include supporting development of Star Wars Outlaws and Skull And Bones. All this less than two months after jettisoning the hundreds of people who worked on free-to-play shooter XDefiant.

First, there was Dynasty Warriors: Origins, which I enjoyed quite a bit. Then Ninja Gaiden 2 Black got a surprise release. Now, we're getting Team Ninja's Rise Of The Ronin this coming March - the 11th to be precise. I'd do a bit about stealth drops but I'm at the point where using game-thematic verbs makes me want to collapse on a bed of caltrops, throat first. Here's a trailer:

It's a single-button affair, having you navigate levels by alternating a pivot-point on a shape I don't know the name of so I'm just going to call a spinny stick.
There are moving background elements in some stages - in others, you make your own pace. Except I can't really make my own pace, can I Bauhaus Bonk? Because the swing soundtrack makes me feel like a plodding buffoon if I'm not responding with appropriate gusto. This is entrapment, game. I am devilishly compelled by swing, like a Reefer Madness extra.

I know some of you are old enough to know what a letter opener is, or even to own one. Statistically, most of the RPS readership are Lich Lords. The Maw letter opener differs from regular letter openers in that when you open a letter with it, you will encounter not a letter but a perfect copy of yourself opening a letter in the opposite direction. The two of you must now fight to the death to decide who is the letter-opener and who is the letter. It's yours for a piffling three pints of any available body fluid, but if you don't want to buy a letter opener you can always buy one of this week's new PC games instead.

Instead of winning over $155 million in damages, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld a lower court's ruling, awarding a mere $154,400 for the Navy's unauthorized installations of the German company's software.

When you offer me a five-hour video essay about an obscure adventure game from 1998, I will hide in the closet. But if you idly wonder where the rivers in Skyrim go, I will follow along dutifully like a baby elephant. This is how I ended up spending much of my afternoon watching David Cage characters pissing. One video creator decided to painstakingly count every instance of playable pee time in cinematic adventure game Heavy Rain. This is vital work. This is important work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A performance and settings guide for a ropey PC port of a Final Fantasy game? Sweet, I haven’t done one of these in four whole months. In fairness to Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, which Nic says can be great as a game per se, it does make some effort at settling into Windows. It has rebindable M+K controls. It has DLSS. It has generally more consistent framerates than FFXVI, which could bait you in with silky visuals before grabbing your head and shoving it into the cold ice bath of sub-30fps.
Yet it also steps back from that game on its supported tech, while raising its hardware requirements so far above Final Fantasy 7 Remake that it won’t even launch on a lot of older graphics cards. Even so, hitching and microstuttering issues from FF7 Remake return once more, along with plenty of other signs that this PC version didn’t get the love that a lot of other erstwhile PlayStation exclusives – like Horizon Forbidden West or God of War Ragnarök – did for their ports.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you turn 33 years old in the next couple of months then, sorry, you are dead. I don't make the rules, that's just how Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 explains the lack of elders in its very French yet very JRPG world. The fantasy game will see you journey across a dangerous landscape to stop the mad "paintress" who's magically culling humanity at younger and younger ages every year. We've been keeping a weary middle-aged eye on its development, and yesterday it got a release date. It's too late for most of us in the RPS treehouse. But watch the trailer for yourself, maybe you'll make it.

Surgeon Simulator devs Bossa have just announced Don't Get Got, in which you and up to seven of your so-called friends are trapped in a large school with randomised objectives and safe rooms. Also in the school: a bunch of horrifying little boys in shorts and braces.


It's out in early access today. Yes, they've sprung this one on us like a ghastly Jack-in-the-box. Steady your nerves and watch the trailer.

A new trailer for action adventure game South Of Midnight sees players battering monsters from the folklore of the US' Deep South. It shows hero Hazel arguing with her mum before a supernatural hurricane cuts off the family drama and sends Hazel wandering the swamps to encounter giant alligators, giant fish, giant dolls, and giant people. Maybe Hazel is just very small. Either way, it also dangles an important morsel in front of our snapping jaws: a release date. Come see.

I'd say it has materialised from the darkness like a ninja, but there are a lot of ninjas in circulation at the minute, and my analogy-jitsu gauge is running dry. So instead, I'm going to say that it has materialised from the darkness like a resurfacing duck, its beak stuffed with pond vegetation. The pond vegetation, here, stands for "tweaks to the weapons upgrade system". Here's a trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We called Amplitude's fiendish and fanciful strategy game Endless Legend the best 4X of 2014, and its hexcellence hasn't dimmed with age. "The music, the amazing variety in terrain and units, the sheer quantity of words bringing to life every last quest, minor faction, creature, and environmental anomaly," breathed a reverential Ollie in 2023. "It's a simply splendid game." Like somebody commenting on the sturdiness of an original Picasso's frame, I will only add that it now runs pretty comfortably on the current least expensive Dell Thinkpad.
Why in Meier's name would Sega choose to sell off the studio behind such a worldly wonder? The answer is lost in time (it's through that link, there), but fortunately, Amplitude endure as an independent - and they've just announced Endless Legend 2 with no less than Hooded Horse as publisher. Here's the announcement trailer.

Fortunately, we had a roundtable interview afterward with executive producer Marty Stratton and game director Hugo Martin. Sweet, job-justifying details!
Writing up the interview in full would involve typing out the words "awesome", "slaughter", "core pillars", and "iPod" more times than anyone realistically needs to read. Instead, here's a list of every detail I found interesting that isn't already covered in the showcase.

Between its multiple release date delays in response to Star Wars Outlaws not selling as well as Ubisoft would've liked, and Ubi potentially being bought by Tencent as they clamour for help, there's a sense that Shadows needs to deliver not only a great game, but corporate redemption.
I've now played Shadows for four hours, having dipped into a bit of prologue action, some open world exploration, and a questline as both the hulking Yasuke and the lithe Naoe. Have Ubi delivered? I think there's a strong chance. What I played was a lot of comforting Creeding, carried along by a gorgeous interpretation of Edo Japan, and some subtle tweaks to up stealth stakes. Although I do think the two protagonists are a split personality that doesn't quite work for me.

Here is a compact selection of ski slopes, each one yodeling the promise of my smooth and exhilarating descent over fresh powder. But wait, someone has littered this Ski Sunday with obstacles, forcing me to run a gauntlet of trees, rocks and rivers. I am thrust headlong into each of these obstacles a dozen times before my withered synapses and tired bones internalise these arboreal teachings and I make it safely to the bottom.

As in life, there is joy to be found in this journey precisely because it is hard. Unlike in life, the camera is often facing backwards while you do it.

        <link href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-review"/>
        <updated>2025-01-23T14:00:02.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Readers, I have spent two full days in the benchmark pits to tell you what you've already guessed: the GeForce RTX 5090 is very fast, too expensive, and laden with more AI tech than Philip K. Dick’s cheese dreams. At least two of those points will, I’m sure, send the average graphics card shopper running, especially at a time when even game developers are growing suspicious of generative AI and its many-thumbed, robot-voiced nostrums.
Yet while there’s not much to be done about the RTX 5090 costing at minimum £1939 / $1999, hundreds more than the infamously spenny RTX 4090, its suite of more purely performance-focused artificial intelligence tools is – dare I say it – quite neat. These range from Multi Frame Generation (MFG), which is basically DLSS 3 frame gen but up to twice as fast, to DLSS 4’s general upscaling enhancements and even the ability to apply newer DLSS versions to older games. All this will come to the rest of the RTX 50 series as well, with some trickling down to the enter RTX range, so maybe the RTX 5090 is best understood not as a practical GPU purchase in itself but as a Picadilly Square-filling advert for its more affordable siblings can do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a dramatic turn of events, the Royal Shakespeare Company have finally acknowledged that video games are cool and theatre simply does not have enough buttons. They are partnering with a game studio to create a playable adaptation of Macbeth from the point of view of someone examining Lady Macbeth's computer for dirt. Lili looks a lot like the interactive drama popularised by Sam Barlow's Her Story and Telling Lies. Except this has the added twist of being set in contemporary Iran. The game "will see Macbeth’s witches reimagined as hackers, with surveillance cameras and cyber-infiltration putting the player at the heart of the story..." Witchy hackers? I'm in.

Nvidia reckon that won’t be an issue with for the imminent RTX 5090 and RTX 5080, though, even with the former’s drastically increased 575W power limit.

Thorson and programmer Noel Berry have found making something "bigger and better" than Celeste exhausting, and have decided to work on smaller projects in future.

I haven't taken a shower in days and a fly has gotten into the cab, buzzing around my ears, anticipating the feast that will come from my sweaty summer death. I just spent nearly an hour driving this tractor to the shop, buying car parts, and rumbling back in the dark. I took my eyes off the road for two seconds to turn on the headlights. It was a mistake. The road curved sharply and I went off a steep bank, tipping my tractor on its side. The door is stuck, the tractor's wheels spin helplessly. There is no recovering from this. I restart the game for the third or fourth time, not knowing whether to laugh or sob.
My Summer Car is as hardcore as they come. It does not simply throw you in at the deep end. It ties you up in a cloth sack with 50 kg of lug nuts and dumps you in the Baltic sea. "Sink or swim!" yells this game at you, but in Finnish, so even that you cannot understand. To a certain kind of person, this is an act of love.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This review contains some story spoilers for the original FF7 and subsequently some elements of Rebirth, but doesn't spoil how Rebirth ultimately reinterprets these elements. 
I argued with myself for several weeks in university about whether to go to a seminar discussing T.S. Eliot's The Love Song Of J. Alfred Prufrock. The poem meant enough to me that I didn't want to dissect it with a class. I wanted to keep for myself. I went in the end, and though I hesitated, I talked because I had things to say. It didn't kill the poem for me, but it does have a slightly awkward gait now, having never quite recovered from the incisions.
I now have to etherise Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth. Cait Sith is splayed upon a table. It's all scalpels, forceps, and oversized novelty dice. It's a strange way to treat art you love. The feeling I remember most from Rebirth on release is how grateful I felt to be alive to play it. Acute, active awareness of my own mortality with thoughts like "it would be properly shit if I died right now because I'd really like to see how this pans out". A personal 'never kill yourself' moment months before the meme gave voice, as the best often do, to an obscure and precious feeling.
An RPG where your character sometimes knocks on doors before opening them? What a time to be alive.

After channels operated by Z-Library and Anna's Archive were shut down recently, Russian media outlets are reporting the suspension of a channel operated by RuTracker, one of the most resilient torrent trackers in history.

The developers fell upon the mortal planes like comets. Where each landed, a game development studio took root. Inflexion Games. Summerfall Studios. Humanoid Origin. Worlds Untold. Archetype Entertainment.
Summerfall appear to be prospering, but many of the studios founded by former BioWare devs have experienced hard times. In particular, Humanoid Origin and Worlds Untold have respectively closed and "paused operations" without releasing a single game. I'm raising a tentatively congratulatory glass, then, to Yellow Brick Games, a studio founded by former Dragon Age director Mike Laidlaw. The company's debut game Eternal Strands will release on 28th January, and there's now a PC demo.

Don't watch the wheat fields, no food. Don't watch the barracks, no knights. You'll need those knights to defend from attacks too. Do you see how it all connects?! Do you?! Please, do your research.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Debate continues to rage on the internetworks about whether premium video games, and especially the ones with the largest budgets, need to have higher price tags. This time, the culprit is Matthew Ball of analyst firm Epyllion, who remarks in a sprawling State Of Videogaming 2025 report that "some gamemakers hope GTA 6 will be priced at $80-$100 [in the USA], breaking the $70 barrier and helping $50 titles to move up to $60, $60 to $70, $70 to $80, etc."
Picked up by VGC, these comments have now been circulated on social media, and have attracted the extremely polarised mixture of responses you're probably expecting. Among those chipping in is Larian's director of publishing Michael Douse, who makes the familiar argument that overall prices for games like GTA aren't necessarily higher today when you factor in economic inflation, while also acknowledging that up-front price alone doesn't explain the industry's recent mass livelihood devastation, and that few people would happily pay that much for a video game - not even Our Lord In Open Worlding GTA.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The relaxing fish catchin' and scratchcard gamblin' of Webfishing proved itself deeply attractive to anyone looking for an easygoing escape. So it makes sense at least one other developer is looking to apply the same lo-fi principles to their own "hangout game". The simply titled Sledding Game looks like a chill afternoon of standing around on mountains with your mates and going for a big slide downhill every now and again. It's still early in development, as you can tell from the trailer below. But you'll be able to embody penguins, frogs, and polar bears as they drink hot cocoa in log cabins and ragdoll into one another willy-nilly. Other cute animals are to be confirmed, but I am putting my money on an dopey-faced ermine.

Of the new strategy game demos I've spotted so far, the one that interests me most is Calyx, in which you are at war with a mass of alien vegetation, which expands toward your base in a blossoming, suffocating avalanche of green moss and purple tendril. It seems a bit raw at the level of controls and performance, but the concept is very promising: basically, imagine if Creeper World 4 were a bit more like Ground Control. Here's a trailer.

"Found a good'un," I wrote in Slack shortly after playing Mohrta's Steam demo. "It's so rad and strange!". Well, that's the pitch, reader. It's a "nonlinear FPS game blending action, exploration, and light dungeon crawling". Very rad. Very strange. Nom nom.

I think your character is supposed to kindle them automatically when you venture into a dungeon - at which point the view switches, classic Ultima-style, from top-down into first-person. My character never deigns to light a torch, however. Possibly this is because, no matter how many torches I loot or buy from the underworld's infrequent traders, my character page always tells me I have none. Is my character eating them? Are they too afraid to light them and expose what those dungeons contain? Do I need to read the manual properly? Or is it just a bug?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An unannounced "PvE Action RPG" set in one of Games Workshop's fantasy properties was apparently in development until being cancelled late last year, according to a new report from mp1st.
News of the project was pieced together by mp1st from several LinkedIn profiles belonging to former employees of studio Thought Pennies. Different sources alternately describe the project as a “multiplatform, social role-playing game" and a "fantasy live-service RPG", although it's possible these refer to different projects from the same time period.

I've just got done tearing my face away from the screen it was attached to by the glitter and amphetamine-infused superglue secreted by Mindwave's minigame barrage. The current Steam demo is a generous slice of a wonderful thing its developers describe as a "cerebral microgame frenzy". It's the sort of thing you play for five minutes before realising, not unpleasantly, that you are most definitely inside of it now. It has wrapped you all up, and it's going to be quite difficult to escape. Trailer below:

The bite-sized two-player shooter was one of our favourite games of last year, summoning the fast-paced killthrills of ancient Quake servers as much as the quickfire 1v1 scraps of the gulag in Call of Duty: Warzone. And now it has a bunch of new maps. Not content with making the powerful pew-pew 'em up completely free (WHAT), the developers have added new weapons, features and a further 30 bullet-pocked arenas. And look, an icy and divisive fan-made map of ye olde Counter-Strike appears among them.

Lumon by Mark Gomersall is a free number clicker based the fourth best television show ever made (Succession, Hannibal, Scavenger's Reign, discuss). It's not a rip-roaring videogame time or anything, but it is cute. More importantly, it's topical. More importantly, it means I get to write "Severance is back!" a bunch. It's back! It is!

It's called Total Playtime and an introductory episode 0 and a Patreon are live now. The third host is Jon Hicks, with whom you may be less familiar, but he used to be my boss and thus may be considered the 5th Beatle of RPS. Anyway, go give it a listen.

The standard practice when writing up such fan theorising is to walk you through it step by step, peeling back the layers like Inspector Clouseau. But I know that you are a busy person, so I will jam it all into a single sentence: a Twitter account purporting to be a Silksong developer has posted a tweet that seemingly predicts the Switch 2 announcement while using a profile picture of some cake taken from a recipe book that was published on 2nd April 2024 which is exactly a year before 2nd April 2025 which is the date of the Nintendo Direct teased in the Switch 2 announcement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s a lot you can do with a third dimension. Texture. Nativity dioramas. Spheres. Hyper Light Breaker, in expanding from the 2D action of Hyper Light Drifter, chooses to almost entirely remake itself as a free-roaming roguelike, trading post-apocalyptic pixel art for big proc-gen vistas and even more acrobatic swordplay.
Its technical ambition, sadly, ends up undermined by the emptiness of its world, the lack of exploratory pleasure that Drifter nurtured so well, and combat that’s more faithful to the original yet doesn’t quite adapt well enough to 3D. Not to mention it has more than its fair share of early access bugs and, especially in the early stages, balancing missteps.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Three-person Danish team The Outer Zone and Frostpunk creators 11-bit studios have announced Death Howl, a very gloomy soulslike deck-builder set in a "stone-age Nordic-inspired" open world that consists of biomes with names like "the Forest of Howling Shadows". Lots of howling round these parts. 


You play a mother, Ro, whose son has been claimed by the Grim Reaper, or whatever they had instead of the Grim Reaper back then - this was, I think, prior to the invention of scythes? And cards? Anyway, while searching for Ro's son, you'll take part in grid- and turn-based battles against a regular cauldron of unspeakables, including disembodied raven heads and what appears to be a huge pair of subterranean lungs. Here's a trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looks like Sony have caught the live service jitters. The company have cancelled two online multiplayer games, including one based on God Of War, according to a report by Bloomberg journalist Jason Schreier. Two different Sony-owned studios were recently told to stop development on their projects. One of those studios is Bluepoint, known for their work on the Demon's Souls remake. They were making the unannounced live service God Of War game, according to Schreier. The other studio is Bend, developers of open world zombie 'em up Days Gone. We don't know what they were working on, aside from the fact it was also to have a live service business model. In any case, both have been canned.

No, don't ask what my real superhero identity is. After all, knowing my secrets might expose you to the wrath of my enemies. And in any case, I don't trust you. It turns out some of you people have been keeping secrets from me, as well. You have been furtively playing superhero shooter Marvel Rivals with a keyboard and mouse adapter, which makes it look as though you're playing with a controller, so that you can take advantage of controller features such as high-sensitivity aim-assist in competitive play.

If I hold my thumb down on the photo in my phone's gallery, it actually springs to life for a few seconds and rewinds time in the process. It shows me wobble the phone into position and take the snap: a giant crab clings to a restaurant, a lady totters towards us with a white plastic bag looped around her arm, colourful signs stacked like Legos jut out of grey, "The Body Shop" lies in the distance because of course it does.
It means a lot to me, this photo. It's the precise moment I felt excitement shoot through my chest, a pang of "I can't believe I'm back". Then the next morning, a jolt that, in hindsight, definitely altered my brain chemistry. A wave of, "I finally get to disconnect and in many ways, I get to reconnect, too".

Both 2016's Tales Of Berseria and 2021's Tales Of Arise had charming worlds and flashy combat, and the latter has found a home on our picks for the best of the genre.

Now the series is adopting the other dominant JRPG trend of late: remakes and remasters. Tales Of Graces f Remastered, a revision of the 2009 entry in the series, is out now.

As with Deedlit - one of our favourite 'vanias - I’m drawn to it partly for the opulent real-time RPG combat, and partly because, to be very superficial, the protagonist is taller than I’m used to in games like this. Sometimes he feels too tall for the levels.

Facebook owners Meta, Amazon, Walmart, McDonalds and others are reportedly scaling back their DEI initiatives to stave off backlash or litigation from conservative pundits and politicians, who regard DEI guidance about discrimination as a form of discrimination in itself. Following the election, I've also noticed a couple of video game company executives express misgivings about DEI - misgivings that, amongst other things, illustrate that "DEI" has come to mean a lot more than just annual training about micro-aggressions.

My mind had been changed long before I beat the final boss, by which point I thought it was good, but I still felt that all the people praising it at the end of 2024 were singing so loudly only because it was good and short and obscure, three things which in combination are easily mistaken for greatness.
Then I pushed past that final boss, mopping up the remainder of the map, and in that last 25% I think I fell in love. Minishoot' Adventures is straightforward in concept, but its execution is a masterclass of craftsmanship.

The mod in question is the GTA 5 Liberty City Preservation Project, a six year project that rebuilds GTA 4's Liberty City in GTA 5's world. It launched earlier this month - and now it is no more, for Rockstar have descended like briefcase-wielding peregrine falcons and performed what is being called a "friendly takedown" on modding team World Travel.
