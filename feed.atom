        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When it comes to card games, it’s easy to get bogged down thinking that it only applies to a standard 52 card deck involving royalty and numbers, but there’s a whole world of card-based games out there that can prove hilariously enjoyable with only two players. 


While most of the entries on this list can be played with more than two players, they’re also very fun to play with just one other person - I know, because I’ve tried. I’ve got a soft spot for card-based games, especially ones that make me laugh, so here are some recommendations.

You can find the UNLRA Medical Supplies needed to complete the Meds Wanted task in the building near the Water Tower in the starter town. Each faction has a different starter town, but the layout is relatively the same for each one.

If you’ve already completed Daisy's house and been inside, you’ve already seen the Boutique, too. 


The Fashion Boutique, as we come to discover, was shrunk down when Daisy left the Valley to avoid the Forgotten. It’s now sitting in the middle of her house, ready to be regrown and placed in the valley.

After talking to Daisy, you’ll need to craft some Wonderland Amplification Elixir in order to upgrade your Royal Watering Can. To craft this potion, you’ll need the following ingredients:



3 Dream Shards


3 Topaz


3 White Daisies


5 Carrots



Once you’ve got these, head to a Crafting Station and find the Wonderland Amplification Elixir in the Potion and Enchantment tab, then use the created potion in your inventory to upgrade your Royal Watering Can. 


Head back to Daisy’s house and water the Fashion Boutique, then pick it up. You’re now free to place the Boutique wherever you like in your Valley. You might need to renovate an area of your Valley if you want it to fit in well, though, as it’s a corner building that looks a bit strange when standing alone. 


Inside the Fashion Boutique, you’ll be able to display any Touch of Magic designs you’ve created, can purchase further spots to display more designs and take part in the daily challenge to get your hands on Daisy Coins, which can be exchanged for unique rewards.

Whether she calms Donald’s explosive temper remains to be seen, but regardless, here’s how you can get Daisy in the Valley.


How to unlock Daisy Duck in Disney Dreamlight Valley


Getting Daisy into your Valley isn’t all that difficult, but it does work out to be pretty expensive. 


To get her, you’ll need to talk to Mickey and pick up his quest called “You Have Mail!”. He’ll tell you that Daisy has been away from the Valley to escape the Forgetting, but she wants to come back and share what she’s found. In order to do this, though, you’ll need to place her house in the Valley. 


Once you’ve spoken to Mickey, you’ll automatically be able to place Daisy’s house wherever you like in the Valley by entering the building menu. At the top, under the requests tab, you’ll see a picture of Mickey. Selecting this will bring up Daisy’s house and allow you to place it.

Once placed, interact with the sign outside and pay the 20,000 Star Coins to construct her house. Unfortunately, it’s not a boat as many may be expecting, so it can’t be placed alongside Donald’s. Hopefully just having her in the Valley will reduce his tantrums, though.


Then, all you need to do is meet Daisy at the Wishing Well in the Plaza where you can continue her quests, including unlocking the Boutique.

After around five months of playtime, a large segment of Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone players have already completed the weapon camo grind. There isn't much left to do after unlocking Interstellar and Borealis weapon mastery camos, so Sledgehammer Games decided to introduce a brand new grind for players to start chipping away at.

Max weapon level is the only prerequisite to starting the unlock process for weapon prestige camos. After reaching the max level, players must earn 150k weapon XP to unlock the weapon prestige camo for that weapon. This new feature is on a per-weapon basis and doesn't have to be completed in any specific order. 


Sledgehammer Games gave fans a preview of what the molten gold animated camo looks like on Twitter, and this won't be the final option. The devs confirmed that four weapon prestige camos will be introduced throughout the next several seasonal updates. Each new camo will have a different weapon XP requirement to keep players busy for the rest of MW3's life cycle.

All Okina Prime Relics



Okina Prime Blueprint - Neo O2 Rare


Okina Prime Handle(2x) - Meso G7 Uncommon


Okina Prime Blade(2x) - Axi B8 Common



The best Meso Relic farm


Also in the Void, you can farm Oxomoco and Ukko. They’ll give you Meso Relics upon mission completion. However, with their drop tables, you also run the chance of receiving a Neo Relic which can still work in your favor for other parts in the Protea Prime Access.


The best Neo Relic farm


While you can farm the same missions for the Meso Relic farm, there is another alternative for the best Neo farm. The survival mission, Mot, rewards you a Neo Relic every A and B rotation, meaning that every 15-minute interval, resetting at 20 minutes, yields you Neo Relics. 


The best Axi Relic farm


Mot is the best Axi Relic farm. Even though you receive Neo Relics every 15 minutes, you’re guaranteed an Axi one at every C-rotation, or every 20-minute interval. It does take a bit, but it is also a great farming spot for XP, Void Traces, and Argon Crystals. 


It should be noted that Relic farming, despite what tier it is, may reward you with Aya, which is used for the Vaulted stuff.

General Relic farming methods


You can earn Relics in an unsorted way by ranking up Syndicates and by trading respective currencies with NPCs in Warframe. These are the NPCs as follows:



Old Man Suumbaat - Cetus, Earth


Otak - Necralisk, Deimos


Smokefinger - Fortuna, Venus


Teshin - Any Relay



This also applies to your Syndicates. If you have 20,000 Standing and are at Rank 2, you can buy bundles that contain three Relics in them. It isn’t guaranteed, but it can break away from the monotony of speed farming.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Size matters, or at least if you want to entice a player base fixated on scope. Nobody wants to spend too much money on a game that falls short of expectations, but some developers take it literally and end up with video game worlds that are the exact size of galaxies — or even larger. 


Let's take a look at the games with the most unbelievably large play area in video game history.

10. Guild Wars Nightfall (a little over 15,000 square miles)


To put things into perspective, some games famous for their large maps, like Red Dead Redemption 2, Skyrim,   and GTAV, wouldn't make this list — even if you combined the three into a weirdly marvelous Viking Cowboy crime story. 2006's Guild Wars Nightfall might feature the smallest map on this list, but it remains much, much la…]]></summary>

Before you get too excited, this isn't a direct follow-up to the third-person action-adventure gameplay seen in Batman: Arkham Asylum and its sequels. Instead, this is a VR title, and it's being developed exclusively for the Meta Quest 3. The reveal trailer doesn't give away much either, with a description only saying Gotham City is in danger... so what else is new?




The announcement does provide a couple of interesting details. For starters, Arkham series developer Rocksteady appears to have no involvement with Arkham Shadow. Instead, the game's being handled by Oculus Studios and Camo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Sunken Ruins quest, the adventurous first phase of A Spark of Imagination, beckons you. Like many missions, it's a journey of discovery, leading you to unearth several magical objects across the valley. We're here to guide you to all the Flicker locations in Disney Dreamlight Valley A Rift in Time.


Where to find all Flickers in Disney Dreamlight Valley The Sunken Ruins quest


When I first hopped in the A Spark of Imagination update, Merlin wasn't quite ready for The Sunken Ruins quest. If this happens to you, you may need to wait 30 minutes. When he's finally ready, meet Merlin in his Library, which should be in the Peaceful Meadows (unless moved elsewhere). He'll instruct you to find Disney Dreamlight Valley's Flickers, in which you must use your Hourglass in the following areas:



Moana realm - 1 Flicker


Ratatouille realm - 1 Flicker


WALL-E realm - 1 Flicker


Plaza (near the Well) - 4 Flickers


The Docks - 4 Flickers



While the Flickers in the various realms only harness one, Dreamlight Valley and Eternity Isle have a considerable number. However, the locations are a bit vague, with the hint to go where "villagers first arrive in from realms." Fortunately, we can put two and two together from past playthroughs, resulting in the locations at The Docks and the Plaza. 


You can use your Hourglass the same way you found artifacts in Act 1. Wait for it to illuminate in gold to locate Flickers in Disney Dreamlight Valley A Rift in Time. Just ensure you don't go outside the area; otherwise, you may discover unnecessary items for the quest.

Players can still uncover other objects when looking for the Flickers, so continue to use the Hourglass until it arrives. Return to Merlin to give it to him, progressing further in Disney Dreamlight Valley's The Sunken Ruins quest.

Aside from being able to enjoy Fallout 4 on current hardware, the update comes with improved visuals and resolutions, 60fps, and general bug fixes. For whatever reason, this initially didn't apply to anyone who has access to Fallout 4 via PS Plus' game catalog, sparking assumptions that you had to buy the game itself to receive the update.

One of the most talked-about points raised during the recent round of previews for Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door on Switch was the game's frame rate. In case you missed it, the remake will run at 30fps in both docked and handheld mode. Now, you might wonder why this is supposedly such a big deal, but those who played the 2004 GameCube original will know that it ran at 60fps.
Is it really that big of a deal, though? Sure, in principal, it would have been nice if Nintendo were able to achieve parity between the two versions, but given the significant leap in visual quality from the original to the remake, we can also understand why certain sacrifices had to be made (sentiments echoed by Bayonetta Origins' director, by the way).

The massive open seafaring world of Sea of Thieves feels fantastic not only because of the amazing water graphics and physics but also because you're often doing so alongside a group of other players. Each session brings with it the potential to encounter another group on its own ship that you'll need to battle for supremacy over the seas. However, the game is also perfect for spending hours out at sea alone if that's what you want to do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The thrill of playing Skyrim is getting to roleplay as a mighty hero, battling across a frosted nation to save the world from annihilation. Sure, the sight of a Frost Troll, Giant Spider, or that first Dragon encounter can be pretty intense, especially early on. I wouldn't say they were wholly fear-inducing, though, but that's where one modder would disagree.


Back with another immersive way to play Skyrim, Nexus Mods user JaySerpa brings us "Stress and Fear," a "dynamic sanity system" that actually gives your character a feeling of dread. As you wander this cold slice of Tamriel, enemy encounters can leave the Dragonborn feeling a little weakened from the stress of fighting and losing health.




Stress meters affect your stats, such as your Magicka, and you can even develop a fear of a particular enemy. Say you barely make it out alive after fighting a bandit, the next time you come across one, you will experience a kind of phobia. Defeating bandits will allow you to conquer this new-found fear, though.


[Pet dog to recover]


Fortunately, you can rectify these stress-inducing debuffs. Eating comfort food, such as sweetrolls, is just one way to make yourself feel better. As does drinking alcohol. In fact, according to the mod description, just four bottles of booze is enough to take you from 100 to 0 stress.


You can also take part in a relaxing activity, such as fishing, reading a book, or playing some music. And yes, in case you are wondering, petting a dog will also help reduce your fear and stress levels. Just like in real life.


JaySerpa's mod also introduces dynamic story-telling. In this case, as you conquer your phobias, you will become stronger. Of course, you have to actually overcome the Dragonborn's anxieties first. Gee, I wonder if there's a mod that allows me to get over my fear of the London Underground.

Cavern of Dreams leapt to the Switch eShop on 29th February 2024. We weren't able to review the game at the time but managed to catch up with it recently. And it's good! If you like that sort of thing...

Talk to any video game fan over 30 about 3D platformers and they're liable to stare wistfully into the middle distance and start mumbling about the 'golden age.' Once Super Mario 64 arrived and codified the form, the decade straddling the millennium delivered a trove of colourful treasures that routinely have platforming fans gushing, nostalgia leaking from their trouser legs. Oh, they don't make them like they used to!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A huge, sweeping, and slightly controversial balance patch hit the beachhead of the Helldivers 2 servers yesterday, and I've had some time to chew on the changes. As you may or may not already know, the Quasar Cannon got hit with a pretty huge nerf - a 5 second increase to its cooldown time (a 50% increase!). This change seems like it should be a death knell for the weapon, but I'm here to argue otherwise. 


You have exactly two other ways to fill the niche of the Quasar Cannon: the EAT-17 (expendable anti-tank rifles) or the regular Recoilless Rifle. Let's take a look at why these puny, rocket-based launchers are still no match for the might of a charged particle cannon. 


First, the EAT-17. Seems useful, right? You can call down two rifles on a measly 70 second cooldown, with the added bonus that the rifles can be picked up by your buddies as well. Too bad this rounds out to just 1.7 shots per minute, compared to the Quasar Cannon's 4 shots per minute. Even after nerfs, that's more than twice as many shots of the same caliber with the added bonus of not having to call in a stratagem! This is also assuming perfect call-ins, with no wasted downtime between them. 


Next up, the Recoilless. This one is a little simpler to neg: next time you're in a difficulty 7 or higher mission and you're fighting anything that might require a missile, stand still for five seconds. Oh, you don't want to stand still for five seconds, because it would get you killed? Well, that's what you're signing up for every time you want to reload the Recoilless. What's that? You can just have a teammate reload it for you? Well good luck getting a friend (let alone a random) to give up their backpack slot, stand next to you, and stop everything they're doing just to reload your gun. 


For these reasons, plus the fact that it just looks cooler than those other guns, the Quasar Cannon remains king.

Unlocked after level 71, the Field Operations instances offer huge amounts of EXP, especially for completing Critical Engagements (CEs). 


CEs are, effectively, large-scale boss battles that spawn on the field of battle, during which you battle a particularly difficult enemy. These battles can be fought by up to 72 players (the maximum number in an instance) and vary in difficulty depending on how many people are in the instance - the more people are in the instance, the harder the CE becomes to complete.

Spending someone else's money on in-game purchases, though, is only going to land you in serious trouble as it did with a priest in Pottstown, Pennsylvania.


According to The Philadelphia Inquirer (and spotted by Kotaku), one Reverend Lawrence Kozak, 51, has been accused of using his parish's credit card on mobile games like Mario Kart Tour and Candy Crush. In total, it's believed he spent more than $40,000 over the course of three years, from September 2019 to July 2022. As such, he's been charged with theft, though Kozak is already out on bail after posting $250,000.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fallout 76 has enjoyed a surge in popularity lately, but this renewed interest has come with a reminder that the game lacks cross-play and cross-progression. Bethesda's Todd Howard has been pressed on the matter and, while he hasn't promised anything, he's said both features continue to be looked into.


Todd Howard made an appearance on the latest episode of the Kinda Funny Gamescast (as spotted by Kotaku) to discuss the Fallout series in the wake of the successful Amazon live-action show. It's been such a hit with audiences that it resulted in the Fallout games seeing a boost in player counts. Multiplayer-only entry Fallout 76, in particular, has benefited greatly, with its concurrent player count on Steam leaping from around 12,700 to over 70,000 in the wake of the show's debut.

Justin used a large language model to answer questions about the Catholic church and Catholic orthodoxy, and if you have any familiarity with how people love to test AI chatbots - or you read the headline of this article - then you know where this is going. Fr. Justin, who was already kind of controversial anyway, offered the sacrament and claimed to be a real priest to Futurism, and gave the thumbs up to baptising a baby in Gatorade in an emergency.
Catholic Answers (who have the domain Catholic.com; gotta imagine His Holiness wishes he'd moved quicker on that one) then defrocked Justin, making him  a lay theologian in a suit jacket, jeans and an open collar shirt that gives him a "me and my wife saw you across the bar" kind of vibe, when before he had the whole dog collar kit and caboodle.

As for the investment ratio, DeNA owns 66.6% of the new subsidiary, with The Pokémon Company making up the remaining 33.4%.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The high-fidelity rustic hurly-burly of Manor Lords is all very well, but some of us yearn for a simpler and perhaps, more elegant age, when city builders looked like a bunch of copulating squares, and could run on PCs with approximately the computing power of a slice of bread (toasted, but not buttered). Step forward Mini Settlers, which has a free prologue version you might try if you're weary of Manor Lording, or you've already exhausted the play possibilities of early access Franconia.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gray Zone Warfare, a new tactical FPS, launched in early access on Steam yesterday, and so far looks to be a success for developer Madfinger Games. While user reviews are split on its quality, enough players have put money down for the game for it to top Steam's best-sellers list.


At the time of writing, Gray Zone Warfare is outperforming both Manor Lords (another recent early access title that's proving incredibly popular) and Total War: Warhammer 3, which dropped a new batch of DLC on April 30, the same day as Gray Zone Warfare's launch. The game is even outselling the Steam Deck, which you can see for yourself over on Steam's website.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gray Zone Warfare's Early Access period has begun, and despite mixed reviews, plenty of FPS fans are jumping on and trying it for themselves. If you want to know how many people are battling on Lamang, here's Gray Zone Warfare's player count. 


MADFINGER Games couldn't have picked a better time to launch Gray Zone Warfare, considering the controversy surrounding its PvE rival Escape From Tarkov. GZW entered Early Access on April 30, and people immediately started downloading and playing the game. 


If you want to see how many people are grinding it or want to make sure it has an active community before buying it yourself, then check out the Gray Zone Warfare player count.

Gray Zone Warfare player count


Because the game is currently a PC exclusive, we know exactly how many people are playing GZW so far. During the first 24 hours of Early Access, Gray Zone Warfare hit a peak of 66,944 players. 


To put that into perspective, that means the PvE title had a higher peak player count than Overwatch 2, Elden Ring, and even Fallout 76, which had seen a boost following the release of the Amazon series. The game is currently Steam's best-seller, which means more people will get their eyes on it, and perhaps boost the player count too. 


If you decide to jump into the game after seeing how many are already trying it out, then make sure to use our guides to the best Gray Zone Warfare settings, and learn how to fix the annoying anti-cheat errors that are locking people out.

It is, like its obvious inspiration, a difficult game about climbing, but here you're using your arms independently to grip and hoist yourself rather than hooking and swinging a pickaxe. It is, also like its obvious inspiration, frustrating and moreish, like a scab you keep picking at.

The CJEU's judgment leaves no stone unturned explaining why that isn't so, leaving case law to deal with the turbulence.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zynga has released a new trailer for its upcoming competitive multiplayer game, Star Wars: Hunters, revealing a June 4 release date alongside a new cinematic look at some of the characters. Star Wars: Hunters will hit Switch and iOS and Android devices on that day, giving players the chance to compete with others in iconic locations like the forest moon of Endor, the icy planet of Hoth, and elsewhere while controlling Hunters like J-3DI, a droid who thinks he's a Jedi, Utooni which is two Jawas stacked on top of each other in a trench coat, and more. 
Zynga says each Hunter boasts their own unique set of abilities to aid them in the Arena, which is the marquee attraction of the new planet of Vespaara. "Star Wars: Hunters features a number of game modes for players to test their mettle, such as Squad Brawl, in which opposing teams will battle to rack up the most eliminations, and Trophy Chase, where competing teams will vie for control of the elusive droid TR-F33," a press release reads. 
Check out the action in the new Star Wars: Hunters trailer below: 


"We are beyond excited to welcome fans across the globe to Vespaara," Zynga vice president Sam Cooper writes in a press release. "We can't wait for gamers to meet our Hunters and hop into the Arena. There are so many fun twists and winks to recognizable, beloved Star Wars settings, creatures, and themes within our game that we also are eager to see players worldwide get the chance to discover." 
Star Wars: Hunters will be available worldwide on Switch, iOS, and Android devices. It will be free, and on Switch, it does not require a Nintendo Switch Online membership to download and play.

If you're a fan of a popular movie or TV show from any time in the last several decades, chances are, they've made a Funko Pop figurine of the main characters. The brand is ubiquitous in pop culture, so it was only a matter of time before it got a big video game adaptation. This sort of game could easily be a cheap cash grab, but after watching a preview demo and listening to one of the head developers speak about it, I'm confident that Funko Fusion is much more than that.
You've never played a game by developer 10:10 Games, but you probably know the work of its staff – the founders of the studio are some of the former architects of the Lego games developed…]]></summary>

While we found that there was some fun to be had with Endless Ocean: Luminous, the repetitive gameplay and bland objectives left us rather bored as we awarded the game a 5/10.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[And that's fine by us.
After playing Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance for two hours, we’d hoped to be able to deliver a smorgasbord of details regarding new additions, performance improvements, and story nuggets, but truth be told, Sega’s preview session felt very much geared toward those who might be playing for the first time over on PS5 or Xbox. In fact, we experienced the game exclusively on the PS5, so while we've got a good idea of how it runs on Sony’s hardware, we’re sadly not able to discuss how the Switch version fares.
That said, two hours is still a hefty amount of pre-release time to spend with Vengeance, so we can wholeheartedly confirm that if you’re a fan of the original, or if you’ve dipped your toes into some of Atlus’ other games, then you can be confident that you’re in for a wild ride (if only for the ever-amusing presence of the phallic-shaped demon, Mara).

Sure, I spent some time with the new stuff, but really, I spent most of my time being absolutely demolished in turn-based battles against various demons of a phallic and non-phallic nature. I will now attempt to summarise my time against these creatures, wish me luck.

        <updated>2024-04-30T14:05:08.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enix, the company behind last year's Final Fantasy XVI and this year's Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, has seemingly canceled some in-development games, taking on some big losses as a result. As for why, the company is aiming to be more selective about its projects moving forward. 
This news comes from a release related to Square Enix's holdings, which explains the company is incurring losses of 22.1 billion Yen, or roughly $140 million, on its financial books for the fiscal year that ended in March. 


"At the meeting convened on March 27, 2024, the Board of Directors of Square Enix Holdings voted, in light of the myriad changes underway in the environment surrounding its group, to revise the group's approach to the development of high-definition (HD) games with the intention of being more selective and focused in the allocation of development resources," the release reads. "As a result of a close examination, the company expects to recognize approximately 22.1 billion Yen in content abandonment losses on its books for the fiscal year ended March 2024." 
While potentially canceled games might sound doom and gloom, it sounds more like Square Enix is sharpening its developmental focus to ensure that the games it releases are hits or, at the very least, financially successful for the company. Nonetheless, it sounds like roughly $140 million of games in development have been canceled and it's unlikely we'll ever find out what they were. 
This release comes after a big splash from Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, which Square Enix released in February. Elsehwere in 2024, Square Enix is releasing Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail, the new expansion for the MMO that will kick off a new saga for the long-running game, in July.

I also distinctly remember making a not-completely serious but also somewhat true statement at the party about how that Tesco trip was the most fun I’d had in months, after which one of the metal men sneered at me. I felt self conscious at the time, but I’ve since grown comfortable enough with myself to realise that the metal man was a joyless fool, and going to big supermarkets is at least as fun as going to average metal gigs. There is nothing a drop D power chord can evoke in me that compares to the feeling of blurrily espying a chocolate trifle in the reduced to clear section. So I wish to bring your attention to Supermarket Times.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Harold Halibut has the vibes of a game that should be 4-6 hours long and is, inexplicably, 10-12. It's inexplicable not only because it's a slow game low on interaction - the game is really just a plot delivery mechanism; a TV show you can walk around where you advance the story by pressing A - but also because it's a game created using handmade miniatures. It's a sci-fi animated dolls house under the sea, self described as "a cross between a game and a stop motion film", and if my game required that amount of labour I'd edit that script down. Then again, there aren't that many locations, so maybe you'd really want to show them off.
I love miniatures, and Harold Halibut is beautiful. It's also a lovely story about finding yourself and your place in the world, even if that place is unexpected, and having the courage to take that step. There are unexpected silly bits and strange bits and bits where people break into song, and bits where you read undelivered letters. But, at the same time, I totally understand why some people would find it boring.

        <updated>2024-04-30T13:46:01.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Housemarque is celebrating the three-year anniversary of its hit shooter roguelike Returnal by teaming up with Dark Horse Comics for a graphic novel, artbook, and a new animated adaptation you can watch right now. This news follows yesterday's tease from both Housemarque and later Dark Horse Comics about Returnal, sending fans into an understandable frenzy about what the teams had in store for players. 
"Another year, another cycle," a post on X (formerly Twitter) from Housemarque reads. "The Third time around, extra loot is exposed with Dark Horse flair." 
Here's what that flair brings to the Returnal universe: 
Returnal: Fallen Asteria Graphic Novel
Returnal Artbook
Fallen Asteria Animated Adaptation
Now, even with PlayStation dipping its toes into cross-media production with Amazon's God of War series and Netflix's Horizon adaptation, this Returnal adaptation isn't the same. Instead, it's an "animated version of the first issue of the upcoming graphic novel, Returnal: Fallen Asteria." Check it out for yourself below: 


Hosuemarque says the 88-page graphic novel will arrive in paperback on bookstore shelves starting October 22, 2024, and it will hit comic book shops the next day. 
It's unclear if the animated adaptation above is the animated adaptation today's announcement is referring to or, if it's just the first part of it, since it only adapts the first issue of the graphic novel. 
Here's a look at the Returnal: Fallen Asteria issues coming this October: 
There's no word on when the Returnal artbook will arrive, but presumably it's this year. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Returnal review, and then check out this story about the PC specs required to play Returnal on a desktop or laptop. After that, read about Returnal's Ascension update, which added co-op gameplay and a new challenge tower to the game. 
Returnal hit PlayStation 5 on April 30, 2021. It launched on PC on February 15, 2023.

These are the kinds of numbers a network TV channel executive would sell his children’s souls to receive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starfield's first expansion, Shattered Space, is set to arrive this fall, according to director Todd Howard. Plus, a new update for Starfield is coming later this week that will make changes to ship-building mechanics and more. 
Howard revealed this and more about Starfield in a new interview with Kinda Funny, which is where the Bethesda executive producer also discussed Amazon's Fallout TV show and the Fallout series in general, as reported by XboxEra. As for what to expect of Shattered Space, Howard didn't say much. However, we already know it will bring new story content, locations, gear, and more to Starfield. 


As noted by XboxEra, Shattered Space will be free for all Starfield Deluxe Edition owners. 
As for the update coming to Starfield later this week, Howard says it will focus on the ship-building. This lines up with what the Starfield team shared last year in its 2024 plans for the game. Here's what it said at the time: "For those who love ship building, we'll also be expanding on ship customization with ship decorations, new ship building options, and more."
Other updates scheduled for 2024 include new ways to travel, city maps, mod support, accessibility and additional difficulty options, and more. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Starfield review, and then read about how Starfield is surprisingly great as a remote-play game. After that, check out this story about how Starfield is more like a sci-fi theme park than an open world adventure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Endless, unfortunately.
There are a whole bunch of, well, let's say 'Wii-centric' video games from the history vaults that, in theory, seem like they might be a bit of fun to revisit on Nintendo Switch. You know the sort of thing, usually pairing some new-fangled/novelty control scheme with an activity you'd never tried in a game before; making cakes, driving a quad bike...eh...bobsleighing with the Jamaican Olympic team? The Endless Ocean series fits right into this mould and, as it turns out, revisiting its chillaxed dives — even with up to 30 other players in tow — wasn't a very good idea.
Now, before we get into the negative stuff, let's start by pointing out that if you're looking for an incredibly low-energy, low-effort sort of gaming experience where all of the focus is on simply scanning marine life and then reading a tiny informational excerpt about each of them in order to expand your underwater knowledge, this is 100% the game for you. In fact, you'll likely never find another game more suited to your very specific needs. Please enjoy. For the rest of us, as much as learning about all the amazing creatures that live under the sea is a captivating pursuit, we're not sure we can justify the price tag given that there is precious little else to do here.

Here's a little something to make your Switch OLED suddenly seem rather inexpensive, an ultra-rare Nintendo DS studded with 2,000 Swarovski crystals is set to go on auction this week where it is expected to pull in bids of at least £15,000. Fifteen. Thousand. Pounds (thanks, Swindon Advertiser).
The super shiny handheld, commissioned by Nintendo and designed by NYC Peach, features a bejewelled pink paw print on the top of the clamshell to tie in with the release of Nintendogs in 2005. It is one of only five designs to have been made at the time (one of which still resides in the New York Nintendo store) which, combined with all those darn crystals, means that it was always going to fetch a pretty penny.

Developer C2 Game Studio and publishers Versus Evil and tinyBuild have today announced that the newly retitled Astor: Blade of the Monolith (formally Monolith: Requiem of the Ancients) will be bringing the fantasy fight to Switch on 30th May.
In this action RPG, you will play as a lone hero (honestly, is there any other kind?) making your way across a desolate landscape in the hopes of solving the mystery of his creators' disappearances. If it sounds very action-RPGy, that's because it is. The developer has cited the likes of Devil May Cry, Bayonetta, and The Legend of Zelda as points of inspiration for Astor's creative combat and fantasy world — both of which look rather nice in the new trailer (above).

It seems like only yesterday that we checked out last week's delayed UK charts, but here we are with the latest look and things have actually switched up a little.
After speeding into pole position last time, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe has been outpaced by Sony's Stellar Blade which makes its chart debut at number one. Topspin 2K25 is yet another new release this week, serving up a podium spot in third.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Trailered last night, Centum is "an unreliable narrative-driven adventure where everything may be a lie", according to the Steam page. Does the suggestion that everything may be a lie also apply to the suggestion itself? Is this an unreliable Steam page? Perhaps the game is secretly a cheerful Playmobile platformer with plentiful ledge-assist, rather than a horrible point-and-clicker that starts you off in a dark cell with a bunch of obviously cursed artefacts, and gets steadily worse.

The Bethesboss had a chat with Kinda Funny and confirmed that Shattered Space, the first big DLC for the brave little space RPG that could, has a release window of "in the fall". Shattered Space adds new locations and stories and gear, and is the sort of DLC that was announced before the game came out, and you got it bundled with some of the super mega hyper awesome pre-order editions (you can still get it bundled with the Starfield Premium Edition if you want to spend an extra 30 quid). 
Before that, though, Howard says we should expect (via VGC via the video) "a big update that's coming really soon", and that "we redid the map stuff, so we have some city map stuff." This is the literal first thing I complained about when I reviewed Starfield. Vindication! This is one of a number of changes teased on Starfield's Reddit community at the end of last year.

The 'Pan European Game Information' board (or PEGI, for short) has listed Hi-Fi Rush for the Nintendo Switch following the game's launch on PS5 last month.
The listing comes with a release date of 30th April 2024, but honestly, we wouldn't look too much into this specific detail since, well, it's today. Yes, Hi-Fi Rush was shadow-dropped on Xbox for its initial release in January 2023, but we can't imagine the same thing happening again.

The second, a reseller in the astrology business, just had his case suddenly dismissed. Nobody could've predicted that.

The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were synonymous with gaming in the late ‘80s and early ‘90s, largely thanks to their influence over arcade brawlers. Games like 1989’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (also known as ’89 Arcade) and 1991’s Turtles in Time are time-honored classics that shaped the side-scrolling beat-‘em-up genre, and 2022’s Shredder’s Revenge demonstrated that the style is still viable in the modern landscape.

For those who have wanted a more mature experience, Jackbox Games is finally granting you your wish, as it has announced Jackbox Naughty Pack, a new release of three games that promises spicy prompts and dirty fun later this year.
We don't know what kinds of games will be included, but Jackbox Games teases "spicy surprises and maybe even some familiar faces." Does that tease a new, mature-themed You Don't Know Jack? Will we get dirtier iterations on some classic Jackbox titles? Or will these be all new games that just so happen to include some favorite characters from past games? Unfortunately, for now, Jackbox Games is being tight-lipped with the contents of Jackbox Naughty Pack.
However, the studio did release a teaser trailer, which you can view right here. Jackbox Naughty Pack will arrive sometime this year, and Jackbox Games promises more details this summer.
Are you excited for a spicier take on Jackbox Party Pack? Do you and the people you play Jackbox games with typically go mature-themed with your answers, or are you more of a family-friendly Jackbox gamer? Let us know what you hope from Jackbox Naughty Pack in the comments below!]]></summary>

Metroidvanias stand apart for me only in hindsight - it's all about the precise ratio of abilities to ability gates, of jump-doublers to overhangs, all things that take time to assess properly. Echo Weaver sets itself apart early, however, by declaring that "time is your currency" and that "when faced with eternity, knowledge is the only gear you need", a phrase that, admittedly, I would probably have extended to "...oh, and a spacetime-folding glaive that works like a throwable fast travel point".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Housemarque, the developer of titles such as Returnal and Resogun, has teased some kind of announcement for tomorrow. 
In a post on X, the developer simply posted a graphic of what appears to be a fractured reflection of a woman’s eyes with the word “Tomorrow.”

Less than two hours later, Housemarque shared a brief video clip of the same image but in animated form.

April 29, 2024
While the kneejerk reaction is to assume this announcement is related to Returnal, be it a sequel or something else, that seems unlikely. In 2022, Housemarque stated it was developing a new IP for its next title. However, that wouldn't necessarily rule out the possibility of more Returnal DLC, if nothing else. Much has changed for Housemarque since Returnal launched in April 2021, such as being acquired by Sony just a couple of months later. Returnal launched on PC in February 2023 and has been updated with additional content and features such as co-op. 
Thankfully, we don’t have to wait long to learn what Housemarque has up its sleeve next. In the meantime, be sure to check out our review of Returnal here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Twitter user pl_evil has helpfully translated a recent letter to shareholders from Bloober Team, showing that their new game "Project C" will be revealed later this year. This will be the studio's next original game, after they wrapped up Layers Of Fear last year with, confusingly, Layers Of Fear (the natural progression for a series: Layers Of Fear, Layers Of Fear 2, and then Layers Of Fear again, although it was going to be called Layers Of Fears at one point).
Bloober Team are currently doing a lot of IP work for other people, with the Silent Hill 2 remake due out later this year, and a game codenamed "Project R" in concert with Skybound Entertainment. Skybound are The Walking Dead company, so I wouldn't give you long odds for a bet on what Project R is about. Neither would I be surprised if Project C is unveiled this summer by a man named Geoff with shiny shiny trainers. I'm interested to see what it is, and honestly I'm hoping it's a brand new standalone thing, rather than a forced sequel to Observer or 2021's The Medium (where I got the header).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon have SHOCKED and RATTLED the world of buying things off the Internet, by announcing that Prime Day 2024 – their latest of their Prime-members-only sales events, which usually take place in July – is taking place in July. And yes, we’re only hearing about this a mere month after the last big Amazon discount splurge, Spring Deal Days. My life is a calendar where every square has "deals" written on it in increasingly scratchy Biro.
Still, let’s keep it summery, eh? Prime Day 2024 may not be a surprise (and is still lacking a specific launch date), but unless the US government announces a second June-based Black Friday or something, it likely represents the next mass serving of PC gaming deals for you to take advantage of. SSDs, graphics cards, or anything else that’s been unusually pricey lately are all but guaranteed to get slashed back down, so there are definitely worse times to be in the market for an upgrade than Prime Day.

There is a second hell in Helldivers 2, a hell made up of wartorn planets and soldiers who fight bile-spewing bugs and robots. And it is a hell that is subject to patches. One such update has nerfed a bunch of weapons including the popular quasar cannon. It's also increased the number of enemy patrols based on player numbers and tweaked the game's level generation, with the former making life more difficult in hell, and the latter possibly making things more interesting.

The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass released in 2007 for DS and is controlled entirely by touchscreen. Back in 2017 while speaking with longtime Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma for our Breath of the Wild cover story, he cited Phantom Hourglass as his personal favorite Zelda game saying that his wife is a fan of that entry, and it was the first time he was in the role of producer. "I have a lot of sentiment for it,"Aonuma said.
Check out the video below for an hour Phantom Hourglass gameplay below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Office of the United States Trade Representative has released its annual Special 301 Report, calling out countries that fall short on anti-piracy enforcement and other forms of intellectual property protection. Countries such as Argentina and China are listed as priority threats, while Vietnam is labeled a leading source of online piracy.

In the heyday of the tennis-sim video game genre, Top Spin and Virtua Tennis were the best players in the crowded space. However, in the time since the genre’s boom settled, the offerings have fallen off considerably, with both franchises going more than a decade without a new release. TopSpin 2K25 signals the reemergence of the critically acclaimed series, and though it’s been a while since it stepped on the court, it’s evident the franchise hasn’t lost its stroke.

That’s the bad news. The good news is you’ve got a month’s notice - and it’s on sale for the next week or so.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/04/26/blizzard-announces-its-skipping-blizzcon-this-year"/>
        <updated>2024-04-26T17:04:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard has decided to cancel this year’s BlizzCon. The company states the event will return in the future, but it plans to showcase upcoming games in a different manner over the coming months. 
First announced in a blog post, Blizzard plans to share details on upcoming games like World of Warcraft: The War Within and Diablo IV’s Vessel of Hatred expansion at other trade shows, such as Gamescom. The company also plans to launch “multiple, global, in-person events” for Warcraft’s 30th anniversary, which are described as being “distinct” from BlizzCon. 
“Our hope is that these experiences – alongside several live-streamed industry events where we’ll keep you up to date with what’s happening in our game universes – will capture the essence of what makes the Blizzard community so special,” Blizzard states in the blog post.
A Blizzard representative tells Windows Central that Blizzard made the call to cancel BlizzCon and not Microsoft, which completed its acquisition of the company last year. In a statement to the outlet, the representative says, “This is a Blizzard decision. We have explored different event formats in the past, and this isn't the first time we're skipping BlizzCon or trying something new. While we have great things to share in 2024, the timing just doesn’t line up for one single event at the end of the year.”
BlizzCon began in 2005 as an annual convention celebrating all things Blizzard. Last year's show saw the reveal of World of Warcraft’s next expansion, The War Within, as well as two other expansions coming after it. It's good that event is only taking a year off as opposed to being canned for good, and we're curious to see how the alternative events shape up over the coming months.]]></summary>

It was Steam's most wishlisted game before launch, and it's so popular right now that Steam's servers are struggling to keep up: there's an official developer post on the game's Steam forum warning that "the store is overwhelmed from all the people buying, it may take a couple tries for a bit while things calm down".

A helicopter will soon join the fray. Many things will soon explode, and you will take a short break from the minigunning to calmly physics some boxes into a set of steps with a crane. This FPS is not so much writing a love letter to a bygone era of noughties shooters, as it is standing underneath the window of its respected elders earnestly serenading them with a busted old keytar from the attic. There are bum notes and the singing voice is not exactly boy-band beautiful, but the love is unmistakably there. And, hey, singing is hard.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lethal Company is a fun game but I know what you're thinking: it lacks feline energy. Whilst the simplistic game loop of collecting scrap on monster-infested moons and selling it to an equally monstrous company is enjoyable at first, it can get old pretty fast. As both Alice and James have attested with their experiences of this month's RPS Game Club pick, Lethal Company is a game that lacks a certain direction the more you play. I soon found myself settling into an existential crisis, reminiscent of my tumultuous stint in retail. A recurring thought back then was why bother stacking shelves, only to have someone buy the products and make me re-stack them again?
In the vain hopes of gaining a higher purpose in Lethal Company, I stumbled across the 'Needy Cats' mod. Essentially this mod adds a variety of cats to your game that will wander around the facilities and yelp for attention.
Perhaps I'm just a glutton for heartbreak, but I decided that the game needed a galactic sanctuary full of adorable balls of floof. I hearkened back to my time playing Stray, the adorable cat adventure set in a post-apocalypse where humanity was all but wiped out. Could this be the prequel to Lethal Company? What if all Apocalypse games share the same universe, all orchestrated by The Company secretly pulling the strings of fate? Or maybe I just wanted to look at cute cats instead of terrifying mannequin monsters. Either way, the cats needed help. What follows is a diary log of my adventures which soon lead to increasing madness and ultimately, disaster.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Great was the consternation of singleplayer horror likers at the popularity of Lethal Company, a landmark creepfest and satire of corporate piecework that is best enjoyed in groups of four. When will developer Zeekerss give us a proper singleplayer campaign mode, the loners of the gaming community wondered, peering from their boltholes and eyries. A Lethal Sole Trader, as it were - or failing that, how about some bot support? Well, this particular monkeypaw finger has curled. It curled about four years ago, actually, when Zeekerss released singleplayer-only horror compilation It Steals. 


I've been playing It Steals (available on Itch and Steam for £4 or $5) as part of our latest Lethal Company-dedicated Game Club, and let me tell you, it makes Lethal Company look positively, er, Nonlethal. There are many points of comparison between games, but while Lethal Company is geared more obviously for laughs, with its whoopie cushions and ReactionTube-friendly co-op mechanics, It Creeps just wants to scare you shitless. It's also brilliant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[James made the observation that Lethal Company, a co-op game about being haunted space binmen, and this month's pick for the RPS Game Club, gets less fun the better you are at it. This is true! It's also janky, and the RNG on the weird, warren-like buildings prompted me to ask "Who designed this? What is this for? What kind of office is this??" out loud, as I faced yet another dead end full of pipes. And yet! There's something about it that endears me to it far more than other similar games like Phasmophobia. Games like this all largely rely on you making your own fun with the tools they provide, but I think we should give the Lethal Company devs props for their tools, because they are weird and make no sense, and allow for some fantastic slapstick.

They're mostly just there to give you an early quest involving goat banditry or windmill rats or some such other domestic drudgery. Or, in the case of Tristram’s mayor in Diablo, to fret behind the scenes about how to properly fit considerable cathedral repairs into this month’s budget. Well, no more must this valuable civil servant hide behind balance sheets, occasionally popping out to cut a big ribbon in celebration of a nearby mausoleum being turned into a Wetherspoons. Tristam is a 72 hour Ludum Dare project where you play as said town’s mayor. And this time: It’s ceremonial!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Escape From Tarkov, the extraction FPS from developer Battlestate, recently put up a new Unheard edition of the game for pre-order, and tarkov escapers aren't happy about it. The price for this bundle - which includes a new mode, a bigger stash, and assorted gubbins - comes in at $250, or around two actual hundred actual pounds, but the price alone isn’t necessarily what’s got a section of the player base so tarked-off that a few of them are even loudly considering a lawsuit. 

The actual issue is twofold: the edition is being called pay-to-win, and is also the only way to access said new PvE co-op mode, despite players previously shelling out notable nuggets for what was pitched as access to "all subsequent DLCs" as part of the now-delisted Edge of Darkness edition.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Late January, the U.S. Department of Commerce published a notice of proposed rulemaking for establishing new requirements for Infrastructure as a Service providers (IaaS) . The proposal boils down to a 'Know Your Customer' regime for companies operating cloud services, with the goal of countering the activities of "foreign malicious actors." Yet, despite an overseas focus, Americans won't be able to avoid the proposal's requirements, which covers CDNs, virtual private servers, proxies, and domain name resolution services, among others.

Even though it's been almost a decade since its release, Fallout 4 has rocketed to the top of sales charts like a mushroom cloud into the atmosphere, which makes today's update perfectly timed: Fallout 4 is finally getting a proper next-gen update.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/04/25/todays-dragons-dogma-2-update-makes-dragonsplague-more-visible-pawns-less-annoying"/>
        <updated>2024-04-25T15:03:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon's Dogma 2 launched a little over a month ago and has already managed to sell 2.5 million copies, but Capcom is still releasing updates to patch minor issues with the game. While a large volume of complaints have been about the lack of a performance mode, this update (like the last update) does not address that issue. However, it does aim to clean up a number of irritating errors involving the behavior of pawns, the player's AI companions.
An update for Dragon's Dogma 2 is now live on all platforms!
https://t.co/waEdG0ntSv
April 25, 2024
For starters, this update makes it easier to detect dragonsplague, an affliction that, if untreated, can lead to devastating consequences for your pawns and your world. It's also contagious, so it's a good idea to nip it in the bud as soon as you first encounter it. When afflicted, pawns' eyes will glow red – after this update, they'll glow more noticeably. The update also causes the disease to infect pawns less frequently.
Pawns should also be a lot less annoying now, thanks to a whole slate of minor refinements to their behavior. They'll jump off cliffs less often (which is hilarious but a wild inconvenience), say some lines less often, say other lines at more appropriate times and become less likely to offer to be hired while passing by on the street. They're one of the highlights of the game, so anything done to make their constant presence more consistent is always welcome.
There are also smaller adjustments, like adding the ability to zoom in on a character's face in shops, preventing monster attacks in town from leading to the player's arrest, and other miscellaneous bug fixes. You can read the full list of updates, as well as all past updates, here.]]></summary>

We thus use this as an excuse to spend some time talking about The Lord Of The Rings games we'd like to see, plus our favourite Rings games from days gone by (and also Gollum, and also we do impressions of Gollum).
Nate has been playing an impressive number of games, including one that did not allow him to invent the stick and therefore hampered his progress.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The announcement trailer for Lost Legions opens with a Roman Emperor bellowing “GIVE ME BACK MY LEGIONS” like a kid who’s just had his pudding taken away. I'd just had a big swig of coffee before watching, and was instantly swept off by visions of an apoplectic Roman bigwig rampaging through the forests of darkest Germania, gluing abducted legionnaires together into a sort of Octavian katamari... and then they revealed that it’s another open world survival game, with no less than two trailer beats dedicated to the act of hacking down a tree. 


I mean no disrespect to developers Tarock Interactive - they're not to blame for my addled imagination - but there are many open world survival games and as a weary Ed Thorn recently noted, the majority are heavily frontloaded with wilderness carpentry. I don’t think survival games should emphasise wood-chopping in their announcement footage. It's like doing a Call of Duty montage of people getting shot three seconds from spawn. Still, if there's no katamari mechanic, the idea of raising a small army of mostly AI-controlled Roman soldiers behind enemy lines has a certain charm. Without further ado, here’s the trailer.

And from the times I've played Lethal Company, I've come to think it's also a game about appreciating the mundane, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fallout 4's "next generation" update goes live today. Timed to capitalise on the Fallout TV show's mad popularity, it'll encumber the 2015-released open world wasteland RPG with widescreen and ultra-widescreen support, Creation Kit fixes, and a "variety of quest updates" across Steam, Microsoft Store and GOG. There will be new items for the Creation Club, including the Makeshift Weapon Pack, which lets you blast people with a piggy bank like Elon Musk, and a new quest, Echoes Of The Past, in which you try to "stop The Enclave from spreading their dangerous ideology and gaining a foothold in the Commonwealth".
They're also bringing the game to the Epic Games Store and upgrading it to Steam Deck Verified status. Such days of bounty we do live through, but beware - it's possible the update will break existing Fallout 4 mods, which will be a problem for the very large numbers of you who've been downloading mods after watching the show. Indeed, the possibility of today's update messing with mods has already seen the creators of the promising Fallout: London delay release to assess the damage. If you're similarly concerned, you might want to disable auto-updates right now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most of my time in Lethal Company is full of tomfoolery, panicking, and ultimately letting the quota down. As I run back and forth from the ship, only able to carry four things at a time in my puny arms, I frequently see the various monster inhabitants of the game excelling at pretty much everything. The Forest Keeper has brawny strength and can travel across the map in a blink of an eye, the Eyeless Dogs can sniff out an intruder in next to no time and The Butler has dedicated his life to maintaining a mansion even after the owners have long since gone.
This had me thinking - surely the various monster inhabitants of Lethal Company would make for a much better worker than myself?
Sure, most of them are ravenous killing machines - but that fits with the core values of The Company. After all, most of your time spent in the game will be collecting scrap on distant moons to meet an arbitrary quota set by The Company. You'll then feed your pilfered belongings to the insatiable maw of a tentacled horror (otherwise known as the boss). You may be able to sympathise depending on your occupation.
So, if the monsters in Lethal Company were given the chance to work for said company, which of them would make it as an employee of the month and which would crash and burn harder than me getting thrown from the airlock five times in a row?
Join me as I peruse the CV's of my favourite monsters in Lethal Company (as far as I know only half of them have opposable thumbs) and advocate for which of them should be my replacement as The Company's new hire. After all, once this month's Games Club is finished I'm not sure they'll even let me back on the ship.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The closest I have come to having any interest in sport is when I got really into reading about football hooligans, or like, Blood Bowl, but I do absolutely recognise the romance of it all. SUDDEN DEATH is a delicious free slice of playable art-pie that celebrates that romance. It is - says dev Cécile, who co-made the project with Nat Pussy and MOTHER GOOSE for collective Domino Club - “a game about love and sports. it's gay, it's very australian, and it's great.” You can tell it’s Australian quickly, because people call chips ‘chippies’, which makes me chuffed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alien-infested submarine sim Barotrauma has received a chunky update, bringing two new-ish monsters into its lethal aquatic world. The shrimp-looking Mantis may be recognisable to veterans (it once appeared in pre-Steam builds). And the Viperling is a venomous variant of the existing Spineling (a thorny seaworm with hull-piercing porcupine-like spikes). But don't worry, the medical systems have also seen a "mini-rework", which means drugs like morphine are "less of a 'solution for everything'". Wait. What?


Submariners in the game can still use morphine, opium and fentanyl to ease the pain of a monster attack, broken bones, wrecked organs, or be-bulleted body. However, the developers feel these drugs have been over-used. So they've rebalanced the opiates as part of their Blood in the Water update. Now the drugs have "a much higher risk of causing addiction and overdoses, and morphine heals much more slowly, making it less viable for combat-heavy situations." Well. Guess I'll just die.

It must be the baleful influence of Creative Assembly's latest free update for bellowing strategy bonanza Total War: Warhammer 3. Out 30th April, the update introduces Epidemius, Proctor of Pestilence - a new Nurgle Legendary Lord who gains rewards based on how many ickle diseases you’ve spread to other factions (already my favourite aspect of playing Nurgle in the game). Does Epidemius also get buffs if the player is infected by something? I hope so. It would be a consolation to know that my ailing trachea is contributing to the Nurgle cause.


That’s not the only new addition in TWW3 patch 5. They’re also bringing a Gold Wizard hero, who is sort of Magneto but blingier, and a cursed crown that will make everybody hate you. Let’s dig in.

This time we spoke to him (through a translator) about inspirations for the game beyond Nier Automata (like the Bible and The Matrix), the approach to costumes and how they fit in the lore, and why having no minimaps in the game was a purposeful decision.

Another Crab's Treasure, as the name suggests, is a humorous and pun-filled world where the sea is your Soulslike oyster. A fork acts as your defacto sword, while various other remnants from above, like shot glasses, soda cans, and more, serve as your shield. With fork in hand and can on back, Kril, a shy but easygoing hermit crab, sets out into the aquatic kingdom to find his favorite shell, stolen from him by a loan shark tax collector. What follows is an adventure that excels at being an amusing and bright repri…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lots of Soulslikes have about as much joy, and the same colour palette, as a burning cowpat. They are grim and dark and often have gimmicks that are a bit middling: mechanical arms that spew gunk, or turning to stone. Or they stand out with incredibly deep combat, with dense menus and rainbow loot. So, Another Crab's Treasure comes as a refreshing surprise, what with it's crustacean theme, platforming, and shell gimmick that actually complements fights in clever ways. Not only that, but it's colourful and funny, with plenty of challenge for veterans and plenty of difficulty tweaks for those who just want a good time. Trade cowpat for coral, I'd say.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sand Land is like a sanitised manga-ish Mad Max Fury Road, where there are fewer explosions and nobody huffs paint and screams "Witness me!". So, arguably, a less cool Mad Max. In this incarnation it's an open world action game with light RPG elements; in previous incarnations it is a manga and anime by the creator of Dragon Ball. My takeaway from playing Sand Land the game is that it is a tremendous advert for the manga and anime, in the sense that everything good about Sand Land the game is from those, and I would rather be reading or watching them instead.

Sand Land is experiencing an oddly timed resurgence. Its creator, Akira Toriyama (Dragon Ball), recently passed away unexpectedly, effectively pointing a spotlight on his 24-year-old creation just as it was being adapted to film, anime, and video game. The video game has been my entry point into this world with characters, vehicles, and architecture that all resemble Dragon Ball beyond even just an art style, and I enjoyed the opportunity to live in a brand new Toriyama world and story. Other elements of the game, like its …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I went to see Civil War this weekend. I liked a bunch of it, didn't like a bunch of it. One thing I thought was very obvious is that it sanitises its titular conflict of any political context. On the one hand, I understand this as part of the theming, said almost directly into the camera by Kirsten Dunst's photojournalist character: as journalists they're there to observe, so other people ask questions. On the other hand, the civil war being between the government and the Western Forces, an alliance between California and Texas feels extremely "Republicans buy sneakers too", if you ask me.
It made me think about the Fallout TV show. One of the things I like about it is that it doesn't pretend The Brotherhood Of Steel aren't absolute mad lads (pejorative). Like, they're clearly not good news, and there isn't any attempt to make them seem like they are - just that they might seem that way from the point of view of a traumatised child being rescued from a fridge like a tiny Indiana Jones. Many of the video games I like pride themselves on offering choice to the player, but in reality they smooth over any bumps in the road to make the choices appear equal - rather than telling the player they are choosing between bad and good.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When, in town building simulation Manor Lords, you erect your first manor, it feels natural to place it in the center of your humble 14th century European settlement. It presents as a locus of power, where your character avatar resides. Also, it’s right there in the title. I built mine down a side road, between oxen posts and granaries, for no real reason but free space. The more I play, the more it feels a fitting place. Not sidelined, exactly, just not especially loud. I need the taxes it brings to pay mercenaries to see off bandits, but lords - their whims and ambitions - don’t set the tone here. Parchment and seals aren’t as important as tilled earth; as winter snow, spring thaws and autumn harvests. So, despite the title, this sedate, curious, and intricate sim isn’t really about lords, nor manors. Not half as much, anyway, as it is about manure.

After a long absence, the Super Monkey Ball series returned in 2019 and 2021 with remasters and remakes of previous games, but it's been over a decade since fans received an all-new Super Monkey Ball title. That changes in June, as Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble is poised to deliver the continuation longtime players pine for. But with some recent mixed results, massive changes in game design best practices in the time since the series' heyday, and likely a whole lot of cobwebs to shake off for developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, I was skeptical about the viability of a new Super Monkey Ball in 2024.…]]></summary>

However, they aren't on this journey alone, as they are joined by a trenchcoat-wearing BX-commando droid named ND-5. Though Kay and Nix were greater points of emphasis during our studio visit, we had to ask the developers about the internet-popular droid that joins the Star Wars Outlaws adventure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Taming a wolf in Minecraft is one of the game's simplest joys, and no matter how many times I start a new world, I always hoard bones in case I encounter one. But once you've adopted a canine companion, you probably hide them away in a house for safe-keeping, shielding them from the horrors of the game's hostile mobs. Today, Minecraft is adding a way to make them a little stronger – wolf armor.


Like leather armor, wolf armor can be colored using dyes in-game, so if you've got multiple adopted animals, it'll still be easy to tell them apart. This variation is separate from the collar colors as well, creating plenty of possibilities. Even better, the game is also adding wolf fur variants for the first time, bringing eight new patterns for a total of nine. Each variant (Pale, Woods, Ashen, Black, chestnut, Rusty, Spotted, Striped, and Snowy) spawns in a specific biome. You can take a look at all the new breeds in the gallery below.

Of course, players will need to be able to craft this wolf armor as well, which is where the new mob, the armadillo, comes in. These armored relatives of anteaters can be found in savannah or badland biomes, where they can be seen strolling around and curling into a defensive ball when certain enemies come near. Armadillos drop armadillo scutes, which are used to make the wolf armor, but the developers have reassured players that they can be brushed rather than defeated, so you won't have to go on an armadillo massacre to protect your pets. Armadillos can also be used to scare away spiders since they eat insects and arachnids in real life, and spider eyes can be used to breed them if you want to make your own armadillo farm.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Epic Games has revealed a new setting for Fortnite that allows players to hide emotes the company considers "confrontational." This doesn't outright ban these emotes from the game and those with them can still use them, but if someone has this new setting turned off, they won't see others use them. 
Called "See Confrontational Emotes," players can choose whether they want to see emotes like "Laugh It Up," "Take the L," "Whipcrack," and "Make It Plantain" from anyone, from friends in a party, or never. Epic says players who have these emotes hidden with this new setting will see a player using the emote standing still, with no emote sound. 
This new setting can be found under "Social Privacy" in the Fortnite settings and it defaults to only show these confrontational emotes from friends in your party. Epic stresses that this setting does not change a player's ability to use any emotes. It is now live in-game.

        <updated>2024-04-23T12:47:45.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Atlus and developer Studio Zero have released a new trailer for the upcoming fantasy RPG, Metaphor: ReFantazio, and it features plenty of new gameplay. It also reveals Metaphor: ReFantazio will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on October 11. 
Dubbed "The King's Trial," this new trailer sets up a bit of the Metaphor: ReFantazio's world more, highlighting a tournament for the king's throne at the center of the narrative. It seems our protagonist and the friends and allies they encounter along the way are vying for a crown that others are also after. In order to claim it, players must complete trials across the lands, proving their worth. 
Check it out for yourself in the Metaphor: ReFantazio gameplay trailer below: 


As you can see, Metaphor: ReFantazio continues to look excellent, with its Persona inspirations on full display. That's not surprising, though, considering Studio Zero is composed of various leads from Atlus' popular Persona series, including the latest in the franchise, Persona 5. 
If you've played Persona 5 Royal, or even the recently released Persona 3 Reload, then you know we're likely in for a treat when it comes to a few things: combat, narrative, and art. And if this new look at the game's menu are any indication, the Persona team has been cooking something special for Metaphor: ReFantazio. 
The trailer also reveals Metaphor: ReFantazio will get a special Collector's Edition for $149.99. The game's standard release will cost $69.99.
Here's what the Collector's Edition looks like: 
Metaphor: ReFantazio hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on October 11, 2024. 
For more about the game, watch the Metaphor: ReFantazio reveal trailer. Read Game Informer's Persona 5 Royal review, and then read Game Informer's Persona 5 Tactica review after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the introduction of Fortnite Festival, Epic's rhythm game within the chart-topping Battle Royale, there's more incentive than ever for musicians to have their likenesses added to the game. The latest of these artists is Billie Eilish, who announced her collaboration with the game on social media earlier today.

April 22, 2024
Eilish is not just getting a skin added to the game (like Eminem, for example), she's the next headliner for Fortnite Festival's main stage event, which will start tomorrow, April 23. This includes a set of artist-specific rotating songs players can compete for high scores in, as well as unlockable skins, songs, instruments, and other cosmetics, though unlocking all of these requires the purchase of the pricey 1,800 V-Buck Festival Pass. Previous headliners were The Weeknd and Lady Gaga.
Eilish recently made headlines for winning a Grammy, Golden Globe, and Oscar for "What Was I Made For" from the Barbie movie, which is a task she's now accomplished twice. Even more recently, she announced her upcoming album Hit Me Hard And Soft, which is likely her main marketing incentive for appearing in the game. For more Fortnite, check out the current Avatar: The Last Airbender crossover and read about the upcoming Star Wars event.

In Tales of the Shire, players will create their own Hobbit before setting forth into Bywater, the shire setting of the game. Here, players can forage fruits and herbs, tend to gardens, fish, trade with townsfolk, and more, all while working to help Bywater, which has not yet been established as an official village in Hobbiton, flourish.

Partnering with IGN, the ID@Xbox Digital Showcase will air live next Monday, April 29, at 10 AM PT/ 1 PM ET. The event will feature "epic trailers, fresh gameplay, and new reveals," according to the announcement blog.
This announcement is brought to you by great indie games 📣

They've also given a heads-up on some games we can expect to see. Vampire Survivors, which cracked our top ten games of the year back in 2022, has been on the platform for some time now, but recently announced a new expansion featuring weapons and characters from the Contra series. Dungeons of Hinterberg is an action-adventure title announced at SGF last year that we got a chance to preview. The showcase will also spotlight co-op roguelike 33 Immortals and Don't Nod's upcoming adventure title, Lost Records: Bloom & Rage.
For more context, last year's version of this event included over 20 games, including Sea of Stars, Karateka, and Vampire Survivors again, somehow. Regardless of whether or not it appears, you can bet the comment section will be flooded with Hollow Knight: Silksong fans clamoring for the game, which we haven't seen since the Xbox summer showcase in 2022 when it was announced the game would come to Game Pass on day one.
You can watch the showcase next week on IGN's YouTube channel. The showcase will also be available in American Sign Language.

In Tales of Kenzera: Zau, the debut game from Surgent Studios, the use of the word "Tales" is more literal than it initially seems. To kick off the events of the game, protagonist Zuberi reads a book written by his late father about a place called Kenzera. He uses fiction to cope with his grief, just as the player might do with the plot of the game, and as the studio founder, who lost his father as well, did when creating the story to begin with.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Embracer Group, the company that recently sold Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake developer Saber Interactive for $500 million, has announced its plans to split into three individual, publicly traded companies. As such, Embracer Group as we know it will be no more; instead, it will largely consist of Asmodee, Coffee Stain & Friends, and Middle-earth Enterprises & Friends. 
Each of these companies will be run individually and traded publicly in the market, with IP and franchises under the Embracer Group umbrella spread across them. This separation follows a rocky period for Embracer Group, which is behind layoffs at companies like Black Forest Games and Eidos-Montréal after a planned $2 billion deal with Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group fell through in 2023.

One of the highlights of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was Knuckles, voiced by Idris Elba. The fish-out-of-water gags and his strict adherence to the echidna warrior code, which is in stark contrast to Sonic's fun-loving personality, made for an enjoyable dynamic within the cast of characters. Knuckles, the new six-episode streaming show on Paramount Plus, tries to carry forward that dynamic. However, thanks to low stakes, a palpable disconnect from the larger Sonic story, and too much emphasis on the human characters in the world, it falls short of the heights reached by the two theatrical films.

“Don’t judge a book by its cover.” A small child dressed as legally distinct Sailor Moon chirped this trite little phrase at me about an hour into Rabbit and Bear’s Suikoden successor Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes. I’m not sure when I realized the adage applies to Hundred Heroes itself as much as it did to whatever the child was talking about. It might’ve been after I met a cleric whose vices included violence and foul language; but whenever it was, it encouraged me to overlook the misgivings Hundred Heroes’ poor …]]></summary>

Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation and K-Pop singer NakedBibi, or Bibi for short, have teamed up to create a new song and music video inspired by Stellar Blade, the upcoming action game from developer ShiftUp. Stellar Blade hits PlayStation 5 exclusively next week on April 26 so this new track, appropriately titled "Eve," is coming at a perfect time to keep excitement for the game going. 
The song itself is pretty great, too, and the music video visuals are very reminiscent of Stellar Blade itself. If you're excited about the game, or a fan of NakedBibi, it's definitely worth your time. 
Check out the "Eve" Stellar Blade music video by NakedBibi for yourself below: 


If you haven't yet checked it out, there's a free Stellar Blade demo available right now on PS5 to give you a taste of what's in the final release. For more about the game, read Game Informer's exclusive interview with Stellar Blade's director for behind-the-scene details and more. After that, read about how Stellar Blade will have no microtransactions, with one exception. 
Stellar Blade hits PS5 on April 26, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon Prime Video has renewed its Fallout television show for another season, confirming that Season 2 is in the works following an earlier report. This news arrives just over a week after the series' release on April 10, which premiered two days earlier than expected to rave reviews from both fans and critics. 
We loved Fallout Season 1, and you can read about why in Game Informer's Fallout review, so we're excited to revisit the wasteland with Lucy, Ghoul, Maximus, and others. As for when to expect Season 2 of Fallout, that remains unknown. The announcement simply confirms another season is coming with no details on Season 2's production. 
Wouldn't want to keep you on the edge of your seat, now, would we?

Fallout joins a string of other hit Amazon Prime Video series currently airing on the streamer service, like The Boys (with a new season dropping June 13) and Invincible, which just had its second season wrap up. It also joins a string of other successful video game adaptations, like HBO's The Last of Us, which is getting a Season 2 next year, Peacock's Twisted Metal, Netflix's Arcane, and Netflix's Cyberpunk: Edgerunners. 
Fallout Season 1 is available to watch on Amazon Prime Video.

Kingdom Come: Deliverance faced a rocky launch in 2018, with outlets (including Game Informer) criticizing its widespread bugs and general lack of polish, but it found success regardless, going on to sell two million copies and release a slate of DLC and updates. Six years later, Warhorse Studios is getting ready to launch a sequel and invited Game Informer to take a look at some early footage and trailers. While it's too early to speak to any performance issues, it's clear Warhorse has greatly expanded its work on the first game, and fans of the medieval ages may be in for a t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jack Black seems to have more or less confirmed his rumored role as Steve in the upcoming Minecraft movie. 
The actor took to Instagram on Tuesday to post a short video of himself on a film lot observing a rainbow before entering a trailer labeled “Steve, Minecraft.” The interior features promotional art of Steve as the actor smiles at the camera. 
A report in January stated Black would be voicing Minecraft’s mascot but had not been officially confirmed by the film’s production companies, Warner Bros. and Legendary. Although this technically isn’t an official announcement either, I'd say there's roughly a 99.99 percent chance that Black is involved.
The Minecraft movie, which has been in development in some form or another since 2014, is directed by Nacho Libre director Jared Hess. The cast includes Jason Momoa (Aquaman, Game of Thrones), Danielle Brooks (The Color Purple), Jennifer Coolidge (The White Lotus, American Pie), and Emma Myers (Wednesday). Minecraft is scheduled to hit theaters on April 4, 2025. 
Jack Black is obviously no stranger to video game movies. He voiced Bowser in The Super Mario Bros. Movie and portrays Claptrap in the upcoming Borderlands.]]></summary>

Children of the Sun is hellbent on occupying your mind. During the six hours it took me to hit credits, I was engrossed in mastering its simple, yet wonderfully executed central mechanic. At first, taking down dozens of cultists with just one bullet was a fun gimmick to tinker with. As time passed, I became obsessed with pushing the tools at my disposal to their limits, repeatedly using people as target practice until I had concocted a satisfactory murder plan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Total Eclipse, a real-time, curse-breaking, 3D adventure (with a dash of Indiana Jones flair), is ready for public testing!
Originally unleashed by Incentive Software Ltd. in 1988, Total Eclipse added yet another groundbreaking title to their repertoire of revolutionary games.
Step into the shoes of a heroic archeologist on October 26, 1930, as a total solar eclipse akin to the one happening today over North America looms over Cairo. Knowing of the Ardognus prophecy, created by the powerful high priest Hahmid III, you must find and destroy the hidden shrine devoted to Ra before the eclipse occurs.
Embark on this exciting journey packed with a trusty gun for blasting through doors or dispatching undead mummies; a compass to guide you through a treacherous pyramid; a wristwatch to track the precious time left; and a water bottle to fight dehydration (you’re only human after all). 
Can you solve this ancient mystery within 120 minutes and avert catastrophe, or will Rah's wrath obliterate the moon?
Our modern reimplementation of the Freescape engine features graphics using hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Total Eclipse support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum, and Amstrad CPC. More releases are coming at a later date. Additionally, there are three playable demos if you want to test the game. Please contact us if you have some other release or demo.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.
