        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[STALKER 2 Heart of Chernobyl is going live on November 20 (unless there are any last-minute delays), and the upcoming title is already available for pre-download on specific platforms.


Developers GSC Game World have revealed plenty of important information surrounding the technical side of things. This includes more data on the system requirements, which will be vital for PC players before they purchase their copy. If you're on the Xbox and have access to the Game Pass or bought a copy, you can download the full game a week before the official launch.


STALKER 2 Heart of Chernobyl file size on Xbox


The pre-download for STALKER 2 Heart of Chernobyl went live on Xbox on November 12, and it stands at a staggering 146 GB. This is the same for users on both Xbox Series S and Xbox Series X, so you'll need to clear plenty of space to download all the files.


You can pre-download the file regardless of whether you purchased a standalone copy or are a member of the Xbox Game Pass. The new STALKER title will be a day-one entrant to the Xbox Game Pass. Subscribers won't have to pay any additional money to enjoy the game on the very first day.

While I have yet to test out the download system on Steam, the game can be pre-downloaded via the Xbox PC app. All you have to do is search for the game and start the download. On PC, the file size is set at 150 GB. It's likely going to remain the same if you purchase your copy on Steam.


While it's preferable to download the game on your SSD, you may also choose to install it on your HDD. Either way, it's going to occupy a lot of space, far more than other recent releases like Call of Duty Black Ops 6.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whether or not you side with Technikki to turn Shipshape Island into an airship or Adaphne to turn it into a submarine, you’ll need to borrow something from Bowser. An airship engine, to be precise.


I’m going to be honest here, this is probably the only time in the game I got snagged. Reviewing a game early means I don’t have access to guides to get unstuck, so I did circles for a while to figure this out. The solution is something that might be obvious to you, I might have even missed a subtle hint spouted by a character, but it left me temporarily flummoxed, so you can learn from my mistakes.


You may have seen the airship engine on your first visit to Wayaway Island. When you enter Bowser’s store room to get the ampberries, the engine can be seen on the other side of a barrier. I want you to forget that you saw that, because it’s very misleading.


My first course of action was to return to that room, then find the way into it based on its layout. However, if you check where the door is and make the assumption that the entrance is on the same floor, you’re not going to find it. You don’t need to backtrack through Bowser’s Castle on Wayaway Island. In fact, in order to get to the airship engine, you don’t need to go back through Bowser’s Castle at all.


Screenshot by Destructoid


Instead, before you would enter the castle the usual way, instead go east down the path that runs in front of Bowser’s Castle. Along this way, you’ll find the back door. In there, you’ll need to use a Bros. Bomb (Ice/Fire charged attack) to break the boulder in the way. You can now proceed onward.


From there, it’s a bit of a tricky labyrinth to get to the storage room. It’s mostly skill-based, and it’s a straight shot to your destination. A pretty big relief if you had trouble finding where you were supposed to go in the first place.

I've banged the Minish Cap drum so many times by this point that my adoration for Link's littlest adventure is old news. With today marking 20 years since this GBA gem landed in Europe, it felt too easy to sit down at my desk and gush over the tight six-dungeon structure, the brilliant puzzle design or the somehow still under-discussed soundtrack. I've been rambling on about these for the past two decades and a big birthday like this deserves something special.
It's obvious what we should do, really. Let's talk about the parts of the game that suuuuuck.

Usually, the PlayStation 5 version of FFXVI sells on Amazon for around $50, but it's currently available for just under $25, making it half-price and the cheapest it has ever been on the shopping site. There's no known end date for this flash price drop, but you should probably make the most of it and snap it up if you haven't already.


Think about it, with 30 hours of gameplay at a minimum, that's less than $1 per hour of stellar entertainment. That's not taking into account the fact that you can spend upto 100 hours exploring, battling, collecting, a…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Epic Games has announced the return of Fortnite OG, a mode that rolls the game back to its original build — but this time, it's not going away after a month. Fortnite OG will be available again as a permanent addition on December 6, 2024. 


The news was confirmed by Epic Games today, following some recent rumors of the mode's return, in a message posted to X. 


"OG is coming BACK and is here to stay," the company wrote. "Relive Battle Royale from the start and explore the OG map, collect OG loot, and relive OG seasons. Drop back in on December 6."




Fortnite OG brings everything back to Chapter 1


Fortnite OG returns the game to Chapter 1, which launched way back in the long, long ago of 2017. Many of us were wee babes back then. Fortnite OG lets players re-experience the game on the original island map with classic weapons, loot, and more. Epic Games first launched Fortnite OG on November 3, 2023, allowing players to get all warm and nostalgic until the company ended the event on December 2. The OG version of the game came with a 50-level OG Pass and an OG Store with old-school cosmetics.


Longtime Fortnite fans have a lot to celebrate this holiday season. Fortnite OG is on the rebound, but it's rumored that Season 6 could also launch soon. While it's not confirmed, a new chapter in the Fortnite legacy along with the return of OG will make for a lot of happy fans who may soon have a lot less time. But I suppose 'tis the slaying season, right?

Fortnite OG broke records when it launched last year. According to Epic Games, 44.7 million players logged on for a trip down memory lane, making it the "biggest day in Fortnite's history." Will that number be surpassed next month? We only have a few weeks to find out.

Many Elden Ring group passwords significantly buff the number of Runes you get when you defeat one of the game's shard-bearing bosses. Some of these passwords give you a boost of up to 5%, so you and your friends could end up squeezing a few more level-ups out of the game's most epic bosses.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Google is facing criticism in Spain and Italy for alleged anti-piracy failures. The latest claim accuses Google of ignoring notices that aim to remove pirate IPTV providers from search results. So here's the thing: why would a company take down 10 billion URLs from search but suddenly start acting differently? The public labeling of Google as "grossly negligent" deserves context too; two weeks ago, Google's diligence prevented one of its accusers from deindexing its own website.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yanagi, the first five-star premium Agent in Zenless Zone Zero's Section 8, has made quite a splash in the community thanks to her highly unique gameplay. As a character, Yanagi is a lot more complex than most of the roster, but if you're interested in playing her at her highest potential, here's everything you need to know.


Best Yanagi Build in Zenless Zone Zero


Jumping right in, Yanagi is an Electric Anomaly character with a significant focus on Shock DoT (Damage over Time) and On-field damage. Thanks to her combo-heavy nature, Yanagi wants to be on the field as long as possible, while you still cycle through the rest of your team to apply buffs and debuffs as applicable. While she does play your standard main DPS role, her kit is highly flexible thanks to the non-static nature of it…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While it definitely wouldn't rank amongst the best console ads of all time, Sony just released a pretty cool new PlayStation ad on their YouTube channel featuring one of the best surprises we've gotten from Sony in a while. 




These ads are always cool to look at. This time we get a glimpse at what seems like PlayStation city, a place where PlayStation's famous triangle, circle, square and X replace the regular traffic signs in a way that somehow doesn't result in an accidental Carmageddon remake. We also see some buildings turning into the PlayStation's symbols, and it looks cool, but the best part comes right at the end, when it announces a price drop of $70 on the PS5 Slim Digital Edition.


The price reduction is yet to take effect on the PlayStation direct online story, so don't get too hasty on your acquisition. Still, Sony notes the promo will last until Christmas or while supplies last, so I hope you manage to find the perfect balance between the two.


Sure, the comments make sure to remind players about the dire reality of having to buy the stand separately, but you don't really need one to enjoy your games. While the notion of a console only getting a temporary price drop four years after its release date would've been laughable in any other gen of PlayStation, this is better than no Christmas miracle at all. This piece of news feels even better when you realize how, for the first time in a long while, scalpers' plans went awry as they stocked up on a bunch of PS5 Pros that nobody is buy at ridiculous prices and have since begun selling them at a loss.


You can now get the PS5's Slim Digital Edition for $379.99 until Christmas, or until supplies are depleted.

For many years, The Legend of Zelda fans have been asking Nintendo to make him speak with words in a game and, curiously enough, they almost got their wish in the most recent installment.


Per VGC, the director of The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, Satoshi Terada, and longtime producer of the franchise, Eiji Aonuma, recently did an interview with Famitsu in which they revealed several fascinating tidbits about the title's development. The one that immediately caught most people's attention was the unexpected revelation that they almost made Link speak since Zelda was the playable protagonist this time around.

With the Switch successor's long-awaited reveal planned for sometime before the clock strikes midnight on 31st March 2025, the current Switch is getting another holiday season to itself.
As part of Nintendo's six-month financial results presentation, company president Shuntaro Furukawa revealed that the upcoming console will be backwards compatible with Switch software, so anyone who's picked up a Switch in the last seven-and-a-half years — or anybody who goes for a bundle this holiday season — can rest easy in the knowledge that they'll still have access to their library (and their backlogs) on the new system.

This is a stunning achievement in S.T.A.L.K.E.R. modding, and may even open the door to co-operative play in sandbox-style mods like Anomaly or G.A.M.M.A. down the line (this is pure speculation on my part, please don't tell Grok I said that).

Where to find Luminaras in Once Human


Luminaras can be found in Ashenton. They are Elite enemies that spawn in three different places, so you can knock out your task in one go if you know where to go. The reason we're all struggling to find them is that it's another one of those naming issues in Once Human. The enemy you're actually looking for is called a Luna Moth in-game.

While AMD Ryzen CPUs for a while now have been defaulting to the modern AMD P-State driver that makes use of ACPI CPPC platform support for allowing better power efficiency, AMD EPYC CPUs have kept to using the generic ACPI CPUFreq frequency scaling driver. But now AMD engineers have deemed amd_pstate ready for use with EPYC 9005 "Turin" CPUs and will be the default choice moving forward. Here is more information and power/performance benchmarks for this shift while testing using the EPYC 9755 processors.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solo Leveling is undeniably one of the most successful manhwa, receiving global acclaim. It has since received an anime adaptation, a game, and even an upcoming live-action adaptation. However, the series' story doesn't end. It continues in Solo Leveling: Ragnarok. After a long wait, the official English release is finally available to read on Tapas.


The platform released a teaser for the webcomic adaptation of Solo Leveling's sequel on October 28. It is also running a promotional event to celebrate the title's launch.


Solo Leveling: Ragnarok first came into being as a web novel penned by Daul, which was released in Korea in April 2023. It was then adapted into webcomic form by REDICE studio's JIN and Brix. The webcomic was first released in Korea on August 1.

Solo Leveling: Ragnarok's plot


Solo Leveling: Ragnarok follows the story of Sung Jinwoo's son, Sung Suho. With one of the Absolute Ones falling in Solo Leveling, the others are set to fill the empty position. However, their idea of filling it isn't of camaraderie. For them, the first to seize the power becomes its new owner. As such, monsters once again start spilling on Earth. This time, Suho must step up and fight dangers, all the while learning of his father's legendary past.


While the sequel may have only just been released, it isn't Suho's first time in the series. He appeared in Solo Leveling's special episodes wherein he was seen clearing a game-like dungeon architectured by his father and his shadows.

These Agents are essentially character skins, which can be purchased from the Steam Community Market. Each brings its own unique aesthetic to the server, and much like Counter-Strike 2 weapon skins, offers a new way to customize your inventory.


Some hardcore players swear off the use of Agents. They can give a free competitive advantage to the opponent, as they make it easier to identify players. Still, they remain very popular among the Counter-Strike 2 community.

Nintendo has detailed some of its offerings for this year's Black Friday period in the US, discounting a variety of games and accessories for the Switch, as well as reiterating the console bundle deals currently available.
First up, starting on 24th November 2024, several first-party Nintendo games will be discounted by $20 at select local retailers such as Best Buy, GameStop, Target and Walmart. These are some pretty big hitters, and would no doubt compliment a new hardware purchase quite nicely.

In the interview hosted on Automaton Media, Valve's designer Lawrence Yang and programmer Pierre-Loup Griffais discussed the state of the Deck and some of its biggest successes. Of course, the crux of the matter was the fancy new Steam Deck model. On that topic, Yang said "If we see similar interest, we would definitely be interested in looking into other color variations in the future," which is good news for collectors.

After the demise of AlphaDream, it seemed like a new entry in the Mario & Luigi saga became nothing more than a mere pipe dream. Thankfully, however, a new collaboration between Nintendo and Acquire has resulted in Mario & Luigi: Brothership, a game that stands as not only the first brand-new entry in the franchise in nearly a decade, but also the first proper home console release.
We rather enjoyed it, too. In our 9/10 review, we said it was "easily the best Mario & Luigi RPG yet" with strong combat mechanics, impressive world-building, and clever puzzle design. Here's the thing with opinions, though... They often differ, and Brothership in particular has proven to be somewhat divisive with a few outlets. Heck, many fans have even taken to social media to bemoan the tweaks applied to the game's battle system.

He plays a decent role around Gulchrock Sea, but one of the first things you need to do is find the guy. You’re told his castle is on Wayaway Island, but you need to find it first.


If you’re someone who is heavy on exploration, this shouldn’t be too much of a problem. You mostly just need to poke around the right Islet after you first start the quest. This happens through the normal course of the story, but if you visit the entrance to Wayaway Island early, it won’t be there. Or, at least, Mario and Luigi won’t know what they’re looking for and, therefore, can’t activate it.


Anyway, in Gulchrock Sea, if you sail to the Northwest, you’ll find four I…]]></summary>

Metal Thunder is an indie project kickstarted by Dumbbell Games, a fresh indie developer with no prior projects under its belt. A potential cause for concern, to be sure, but the good news is that Metal Thunder is already out and about. Sure, it's an Early Access title, but it's priced at a fairly humble 10,79 EUR (with 15% off to celebrate the release), and it's already got an assortment of positive reviews to prop it up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While some might've seen this one coming, the fact that Valve just announced a phenomenally clean white Steam Deck OLED still comes as a surprise to many of us. That's right: we now know that there's a white Steam Deck OLED coming very soon, and it will be available worldwide.


Or, at least as worldwide as the other Steam Deck models have been. Whereas last year's limited-edition translucent black Steam Deck OLED was only available in the territories of the US and Canada, the white model will be available across the board. If you can buy a Deck, you can buy the fancy pearly one, in other words. 


Better yet, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong fans will be able to purchase it as well via Komodo. The white model will effectively be the same as any other top-of-the-line OLED Deck, as…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In just over a week's time, GSC Game World will release STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl, the long-awaited follow-up in the studio's cult horror FPS series. The last installment we saw was Call of Pripyat way back in 2009, so it's been a while.


In preparation for STALKER 2's release, you may need to clear some space on your hard drive. As noted by PC Gamer (and seen on the game's Steam page), you'll need storage capacity to the tune of 150GB. It also looks like you will definitely need an SSD rather than a much slower HDD, which most people will likely have these days. Still, that's a fair amount of space needed.




To put it into perspective, Black Ops 6 "only" requires 128GB, according to Steam. Call of Duty games are often noteworthy for their hardware requirements, so seeing Heart of C…]]></summary>

Not alongside the upcoming RTX 50 series, as rumoured, but right-now-today-this-minute. I’ve been testing out the launch version and while it’s not without some dud features, it does agreeably achieve its stated goal of combining the functions within Nvidia Control Panel and GeForce Experience. And if installing it means never having to use the latter again, well, that’s 149MB well spent.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My strongest and most enduring memory of Grand Theft Auto will always be creasing into complete hysterics watching my mate pile into a crumpled police officer with a wooden baseball bat in GTA 3 after school one time. Young’uns these days just don’t appreciate how revolutionary it was to be able to hit a cop with a thing after he’d already fallen over. Suffice it to say I’ve got good memories of the open world series’ nascent forays into 3D, though never enough to tempt me into revisiting them, especially given the poor reception to Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition. I can sympathise. I’m annoyed just having to type a colon and a dash in the same game name.
If you’re in a similarly non-fussed position (I will never not be annoyed that ‘nonplussed’ doesn’t mean what it sounds like it should mean) I can’t imagine a lighting update that’s been available on the mobile versions for a while is enough to tempt you back. But what is a reporter's job if not pathetically treading water between chunklets of Grand Theft Auto news, upon the publishing of which Graham presses the button to release the nutritious pellets on which we all wholly subsist? I hope he doesn’t read that last sentence. I don’t get my pellet if the syntax becomes too convoluted. Moving swiftly on.

The third and strongest instalment of GSC Game World's S.T.A.L.K.E.R. trilogy brings this excellent set of Switch remasters to a close. In some ways, it feels inaccurate to say Call of Prypiat is the best of the three because it so effectively capitalises on the groundwork laid by Shadow of Chornobyl, but it’s a brilliant, welcome return to atmospheric exploration and emergent horror, with a reduced focus on firefights.
An intro cinematic recaps the real and fictional events that led to the opening of the Zone’s mysterious centre. The military has enacted ‘Project Fairway’ to beat the other factions and reach the area first. Predictably, this doesn't go well and Major Alexander Degtyarev, an ex-Stalker, is sent to investigate crashed helicopters scattered across the Prypiat outskirts.

The Minstrel’s Ballad: Sphene’s Burden is the boosted-difficulty version of the Dawntrail MSQ “The Interphos” Trial.

It goes without saying that a game based on Jujutsu Kaisen is bound to be popular. The global servers include almost every popular character at launch. Just like the Japanese servers, a clear tier list already emerged in the first week. Certain characters are simply better and far more effective compared to the remaining names present in the game.

The global servers might have different characters available on the roster, but it's less than the Japanese version. That said, you can still have a healthy set of choices while making the pick. To classify the characters, I have used four tiers.

Outfit Glamours are designed to condense all of the pieces from a particular glamour set so that the whole set only takes up one space in your Glamour Dresser, rather than the five or six slots that it would previously. This is a great little feature, but there is a caveat.

With the new option to change your interior design, it doesn’t matter where the house is, the inside is up to you.

We had a great time with The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom earlier this year, but that's not to say that it's without its faults. A fair few of us got frustrated with the variable frame rate and the Echoes menu system could often feel like a scroll too far.
Two months on, a handful of the game's developers have sat down with the BBC to talk about these criticisms and attempt to explain the thought process behind them. And it'll come as no surprise that Nintendo has an optimistic spin to put on each.

The game is launching a "Classic" mode today that will let you play the first-person payload pusher as it (mostly) was back in 2016 when the first Overwatch launched. That means 6v6 fights, the original abilities of its heroes, and no limits to stop the entire team picking the same character.

Legendary game designer Masahiro Sakurai has offered up some invaluable wisdom (as if he hasn't already been sharing his knowledge for the last two years or so) after noticing a cosplayer showcasing a rather awkward blunder with their impressive Link costume.
The costume, based on Link's appearance in Zelda: Breath of the Wild, is remarkably faithful to the original design, but thanks to such diligent efforts from @sakigake_cos to stick to the source material, the cosplayer found themselves struggling to unsheath the legendary Master Sword.

Imagine me lying my floor, massaging my temple with one hand and giving a fat thumbs up with the other.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Castle Master, the haunting conclusion to the Freescape engine saga, is now ready for public testing!
Prepare yourself for a perilous adventure as you lower the drawbridge to enter the Castle Master’s domain. Released in 1990 by Incentive Software, Castle Master became popular for its technical innovation and challenging gameplay. The game inspired countless 3D adventure titles, and the Freescape engine itself marked a technological milestone, enabling groundbreaking object interaction and spatial puzzles.
Notably, Castle Master was one of the first games to let you choose to play as either a prince or a princess, offering a different experience depending on your choice.
Your mission: rescue your twin, imprisoned within the eerie depths of Castle Eternity by the evil Magister. This sprawling, foreboding castle is filled with traps, monsters, and puzzles blocking your path. Gather items, unlock doors, and solve complex riddles as you navigate the labyrinthine halls and confront the dark forces within.
This modern reimplementation showcases enhanced graphics using OpenGL, with initial support for the DOS and ZX Spectrum releases. If you’re eager to embark on this dark journey, a playable demo is available to test your tenacity.
To participate in the testing, ensure you have a daily development build. We encourage all players to submit feedback and bug reports through our issue tracker.
Will you brave the creepy corridors of Castle Eternity and free your sibling, or will you fall victim to the Magister’s curse and join his army of enslaved spirits? The adventure awaits!

Still, it's an ever-evolving thing and Activision have announced the game's first seasonal drop. It's a hefty one with a lot of additions, so I'll try my best to break down the good stuff. TLDR: there's some new maps for multiplayer and zombies, new modes, and a few extra bits. I'm mildly excited for more. More in this case is good.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["The cool thing about bombs is that you can hide them in anything," is probably my favourite Oppenheimer quote of all time, and in the case of Ian Hitman, it does raise an important question: with so many everyday objects equal to the rubber duck in its unthreatening aura, yet more inconspicuous, why choose to put an explosive in this one?
The simplest answer is that’s it’s a recurring bit of levity, a holdover easter egg, elevated to the status of key mission item in Hitman: Codename 47 before being given pride of place as an explosive in the World Of Assassination games. But to ascribe such unassuming purpose to the duck is to ignore its revelatory power. We must go deeper.

It looks like they're focusing on the act of throwing capsular items to catch or release monsters, together with the usage of monsters as mounts.
If you've somehow yet to encounter Palworld, it's a bestselling survival game that takes hefty - some would say, scandalous - inspiration from Pokémon, with players poaching Pokésque critters using magic spheres, and deploying them as soldiers and minions.

There’s only one of the three characters available in the freebie (one of the others is a toad nun with a shotgun), but he’s got a little cutlass, a flintlock pistol, and a can-do attitude - at least when it comes to either stabbing or shooting things. The game itself is a little bit deckbuilder, a little bit Into The Breach: turn based strategy with perfect information and various tricks you can pull to make enemies hit each other instead of the thing you’re trying to protect. Indulge yourself on the gourmet tray-tray below.

I haven't really thought about it before, but Rift Riff's effusively laidback crowd control has me pondering those optimal moments in any tower defender when the incoming horde hits the flamer-MG triangle just right, and you can settle back comfortably into the role of clockwatcher.
Rift Riff encourages this behaviour by being nice to look at. Created by a trio of developers including Hidden Folks designer Adriaan de Jongh, it's a world of spacey, sun-carved mountains, forests and monoliths. The towers resemble the sacred architecture of Monument Valley, and the colour scheme and general ambience remind me of Cocoon. There's a demo, if you fancy it.

There has never been a better time than right this second – averaged out, and despite repeated attempts to the contrary, humanity has never been healthier, freer, or more enlightened by knowledge. It’s true of games too. For every by-committee platter of passionless map markers, there are thousands of more personal, more creative, more interesting works, all adding to the decades' worth of great stuff we can still play today.
What isn’t bollocks is the emotional pull that nostalgia, for all its lack of cold, hard reason, still manages to wield inside our warm, squishy brains. Hence, the centrepiece of Apex Legends’ Season 23 update is a mode that recreates the battle royale FPS as it was back in 2019, defaulting back to the original map and weapon arsenal while cutting the 26-strong legend roster to the earliest ten. It’s a Fortnite-style rolling back of the clock, and a passably enjoyable one, but also a reminder that the good old days weren’t always that good.

It was fun enough that I wish there was a taiko drum peripheral available for PC now the series is on our platform. 

Taiko no Tatsujin: Rhythm Festival is out now via Steam, where it offers over 70 songs to drum through, and a subscription service through which to unlock over 700 more. Maybe I should try to get my Donkey Konga drums working on PC, but I'll probably settle for playing it with a gamepad.

"Why, that's a Mass Effect vessel. Some mistake here surely?" 1) My name's not Shirley, and 2) Indeed it is a Mass Effect ship, but HelloGames struck a time-limited deal with BioWare to create a version for their own space sim.
"Blast, if only I'd noticed this at the time and acquired one," you mourn. "Ah, so many years I have wasted." Be of good cheer, my friend, for No Man's Sky has a Normandy once again, just in time for the latest N7 Day of assorted Mass Effect celebrations. For the next two weeks, you'll be able to get a-hold of it by way of a revised version of 2021's Beachhead Expedition. Tray-tray, away!

Everything revolves around catching, selling, and collecting the fish that gather in the rivers of a small island. It also lets you customise your character with clothing. Mostly simple hats and shorts, but some options let players celebrate their sexuality, such as a rainbow-adorned t-shirts, or titles that hang above your character which simply say "Trans" or "Bi". All this led one player to complain there was no "Straight" title. So, the developer added one. It costs 10 grand.

An anonymous insider averred that studio heads were "worried" about the new open world game's progress - hence, perhaps, Rockstar's decision to mandate a full return to in-office work. Pshaw, say publishers Take-Two CEO. They announced a fall 2025 launch in March and have just doubled down on it in their latest financial briefing, with CEO Strauss Zelnick subsequently going on the tellybox to say that Take-Two are "highly confident in the timing", though he still has nothing to share about GTA 6 on PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The dominion of hated Super Earth threatens to expand afresh as Arrowhead CEO Johan Pilestedt toys openly with the prospect of Helldivers 2 cross-over games, beginning with tabletop wargame Trench Crusade and extending to, well, take your pick. Arrowhead's appetite for other licenses appears insatiable. It's the kind of sheer expansionism you'd expect from Earth's loathsome regime, whose "managed democracy" propaganda continues to enthrall thousands of hapless disposable imperialists. Pilestedt even wants to make a Fifth Element game! Milla Jovovich is spinning in her grave. Milla Jovovich isn't dead, you say? Well, that's good news at least.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I was a competitive long-distance runner at school, breath control was paramount. We were never really taught this, mind. It was an art you picked up through practice: how to breathe before the race, saturating your blood with O2 without dizzying yourself; when to permit the shorter, emergency breaths and when to apply restraint; when to deepen your inhales and charge yourself up for an attack on a hill.
And then, how to organise your body around your breath, straightening your posture to expand your lungs without tipping back too far and squandering muscle power; how to breath in time with your stride and the movement of your shoulders, so as to firm up your momentum and shave a miraculous-feeling minute off your finishing time. All this, plus various daft psychological war gambits of my own devising. When overtaking or being overtaken, I used to seal my lips shut on that side and breath through the other corner of my mouth, to make it look like I was hardly out of breath at all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Calling a game ‘no frills’ or ‘no nonsense’ is always a back-handed compliment, because it sounds like you're saying it's a bit straightforward and simple. And yes, that’s exactly what I’m saying here. Acts Of Blood feels like a spiffy PS2 action brawler; a slightly tighter old Yakuza game, or a stripped-back Sifu. It’s snacky and a bit janky, but it’s also great coffee break fodder, assuming you want to spend your break breaking a selection of heavy objects over the crumbly skulls of ne’er-do-wells. I mean, they might have done some things well, I don’t know them. But they aren’t doing any well to my character in the game, so violence it is.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There must be hundreds of typewriters in the hall, their collective clacks a tidal wave of soulless automation, rising up to greet agent Kiran Estevez as she enters, pistol and flashlight in hands. Exploring rooms to the side, Alan Wake 2: The Lake House’s star finds whiteboards and documents revealing the typewriter’s purpose: to mimic Wake’s writing. Pages are graded along criteria such as ‘style’, ‘tone’, and ‘content’, then “fed into the algorithm” as references until “near-identical stories” to Wake’s can be produced.
“If Jules could simply cut the painter open and pull the painting out of him, he would,” reads one of the real Alan’s typewritten pages. That’s Jules Marmont, the obsessive head of the titular FBC centre. The Marmonts - Jules and his wife Diana - are running experiments to forcibly and synthetically create works of art, aiming to mimic creative passion convincingly enough for the paranatural entity inside Cauldron Lake to respond, as it has in the past.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Putting aside my natural annoyance at Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater for almost beating out the Twarhammer series in the headline real estate wars, I am more than a little excited to play. Some days, you simply must feast on a tree frog, and while we still don’t have a solid release date, that day doesn’t feel too far away. Good news for stealth fans, and perhaps gooder news for a dozen strapline writers sweating profusely, soiling themselves in anticipation of using “kept you waiting, huh?”.
Until then, I at least have a steady drip feed of new information to keep me sated, the latest of which is the substantial hint that there'll be some new dialogue in the game, as per the video below. Alongside that, the previously pseudonymous Suzetta Miñet - who was credited with voicing EVA in MGS3 and Peace Walker - has revealed herself to be Jodi Benson, the voice of Ariel in Disney’s The Little Mermaid. Cheers for the spot, Automaton West.

It's a massively multiplayer World War 2 game, viewed from above, where battlefield logistics matters as much as aiming and flanking. Its developers have just announced a major new update coming next summer, Foxhole: Airborne, which adds planes to the game for the first time.

Planes, in a topdown MMO? It makes a little more sense if you watch the trailer.

You’ll find the vlog in its full glory below. What’s interesting about this one is that vlog mainstay director Rich Alridge has brought along some new faces: battle designer Josh King and audio director Chris Goldsmith. And, yes, so no-one can accuse me of burying the lede: that audio design involved the enthusiastic, deeply disgusting slurping of porridge and yoghurt, and the jangling of real bones. The source of the bones is not revealed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After seven months of intense work, we are ready to announce support for a few games based on qdEngine, developed by K-D Labs.
The work is based on the original sources published now under GPL, although the work started a bit earlier than that. The engine supports 14 games, five of which we are announcing support for. Most of these games were released in Russian; however, there were Lithuanian, Czech, and Polish releases. The support is announced for:
Wait for it! Issue 3. Song for a Hare, (Russian: Ну, погоди! Выпуск 3. Песня для зайца, Lithuanian: Na, palauk! Zuikio dainos, Czech: Jen počkej a Píseň pro zajíce)
Mask Show (Russian: Маски-шоу)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Meeting Sea Rat (Russian: Три маленькие белые мышки. Визит Морской крысы, Czech: Příběhy myší rodinky I, Polish: Były Sobie Myszki Trzy: Na Spotkanie Cioci Myszy)
The Adventures of the Good Soldier Schweik (Russian: Похождения бравого солдата Швейка)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Sea Rat's Birthday, (Russian: Три маленькие белые мышки. День рождения морской крысы, Polish: Były Sobie Myszki Trzy: Urodzinowe Śledztwo)
Other games do work; however, we haven’t playtested them. You may find more information on our Wiki. Also, we are looking for the Lithuanian version of Little Longnose and Polish releases of Little Mice games and Wait for it! game. If you happen to have a copy, please contact sev.
We continue the active development so that support for other games will follow shortly. The primary constraint is playtesting.
To run these games, you need the latest daily build of ScummVM. If you encounter any hiccups during your quests, please file them on our issue tracker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A lawsuit filed in the U.S. claims that a pirate IPTV seller adopted a novel marketing strategy to support a business with 450,000 subscribers . According to the plaintiffs, the owner of the service "held himself out as a Chicago-area law enforcement officer" to "mitigate potential concerns" over the unlawfulness of his business. A theoretical damages claim of more than a billion dollars, plus an allegation of wiretapping, makes this case a little more spicy than most.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've spent quite a lot of today trying to figure out why, exactly, some of the monsters in the Monster Hunter Wilds beta looked like bundles of copulating pyramids slathered in crocodile gravy. Nic clued me in on this reddit thread earlier, which cites unnamed Chinese players who've allegedly data-mined the beta's monster models, and learned that they are extremely large, encompassing hundreds of thousands of polygons.
If every monster in Monster Hunter Wilds were that fancy all of the time, your computer would become a volcano. As such, the game resorts to loading-on-demand systems to ensure that you only see those gorgeous details when the monsters are close by and, as the case may be, angrily sitting on you. When they're further afield, the flourishes fall away to free up memory and processing power. The popular Redditor explanation for the presence of monsters that look like Henry Moore sculpture is basically that the LOD systems are being forgetful, and neglecting to load the additional polygons at proximity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a yearly blockbuster, Call of Duty, through sheer expense and effort, would like you to think it is the Die Hard of video games. Or, depending on the setting, the Saving Private Ryan of video games. But it is barely Black Hawk Down. This latest campaign in Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 reminds me more of the forgettable Netflix shootfests that thumbnail their way across your TV screen as you try to find some gritty nothing to aid you in zoning out of life. Still, there is an anecdotal contingent of casual sofa sitters for whom Call Of Duty is the game. A balls-to-the-wall shooter to return to every winter and rinse through in a weekend. Ed has already gestured at its multiplayer, announcing: "yup, it's COD", like a deeply tired Captain Birdseye inspecting the day's catch, wondering when his life will change. But never mind that. How does the single player story mode hold up? Some are calling it the best campaign in years. And I guess that's true, in the sense that it is the least worst.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Discourse? Look mate, I’m just here to test the Steam Deck. Dragon Age: The Veilguard runs like a tap on any halfway decent desktop hardware, so was naturally going to be worth trying on the weaker Deck. And sure enough, Bioware’s RPG (which is really more of an action game with the occasional verbal spar) settles comfortably into handheld life.
In fact, Valve have festooned its Steam page with a Verified medal, a seal of approval for any game that performs and controls well on the Steam Deck without any glaring weaknesses or impractical annoyances. It’s still worth playing around with the settings – more on those later – but I’ll back up that official assessment, having played for several hours without so much as an undersized tooltip.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The trailer for Bambas! starts off innocently enough. It's an "innovative urban walking simulator" in which you play a disembodied pair of shoes, individually moved with a controller's analog sticks and trigger buttons. The first half of the trailer is all whimsy and playground fun - kicking a football, standing on a climbing frame, riding a skateboard. But then a note of darkness creeps in, as the player begins to channel the sheer nihilistic inconsequentiality of a world in which shoes have no thinking human bodies to restrain them.

It'd be more fitting to say it's somehow automated the whole process: an inserter plucked out the rulebook from my brain and deposited it in hot magma, while a new rulebook was churned out in a nearby machine and plopped into my brain from the other side - only for that to be immediately plucked out and incinerated as well. With each new planet and each new phase, Space Age reinvents itself. I'm battling hyperbole here, but ah hell, I admit defeat. Factorio: Space Age is a masterpiece, the final form of perhaps the most well-crafted building game I'll ever play.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Early reactions to Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 multiplayer range from frothing dislike through omnimovement hype to our own Ed Thorn's dead-eyed appraisal that it's "a good one, I think. Not a bad one. If you like Call Of Duty, you will like this. If you don't like Call Of Duty, you will not like this." I feel like we need to emergency-deploy a supply crate of smelling salts, because the sheer OK-ness of Black Ops 6 appears to have tumbled Ed into a stupor. 


Perhaps it would be a different story if he'd encountered some of the spawning issues and glitches people are talking about, with players joining games and materialising right into a hail of fire. The players in question include Black Ops 6's developers, who comically note in the latest Black Ops 6 patch notes that "Yes, we saw ourselves in a Killcam before selecting a Loadout too." The latest patch seeks to address this, naturally. As regards the campaign side of things, it also resets your safehouse currency to 5000, if you've had your single player funds stolen (or multiplied) by technical gremlins.

For all the things I ended up enjoying about Dragon Age: The Veilguard, it isn’t much of an RPG. What little roleplaying it does offer revolves around what flavour of supportive hero you prefer, and you can count the number of impactful dialogue decisions on a three-fingered hand. This might sound utterly damning in the wake of Baldur's Gate 3’s incredible reactivity, and if I approached games as some sort of tedious comparative intellectual exercise rather than just, y’know, seeing how I felt about them, then I suppose it would be. Weirdly, though, the recent memory of Baldur’s Gate 3 didn’t diminish my time with Veilguard at all. It was actually the opposite: it freed Dragon Age from having to carry the torch for a certain period in Bioware’s history, and let me enjoy Veilguard for what it was.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Twitch have introduced a new "Politics and Sensitive Social Issues" label for streams that "focus" on topics like "elections, civic integrity, and war or military conflict". As with the streaming giant's existing labels for M-rated material, sexual themes or depictions of gambling, the idea is that viewers can filter out such streams in advance by altering their settings.
Advertisers, similarly, can "make better choices about the content they want to advertise next to" - in other words, pull their ads from a whole swathe of material if they don't want to be associated with anything controversial. Twitch's hope is that "the labels will allow advertisers to have more context to inform which types of streams they show their ads alongside, which we expect to increase brands’ confidence in running ads on Twitch, and could bring new advertisers to our service."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The mystery surrounding Deadlock, Valve’s work-in-progress MOBA shooter, has largely evaporated. Its freely extendable invite system is about as effective at controlling player headcount as a disinterested football steward, meaning pretty much anyone with a clued-in Steam friend can get in and start poking around its secrets. And yet, being a lane-pushing wizard fighter in the Dota 2 vein, it’s already a vast tangle of interplaying abilities, items, strats, and often unspoken rules, of the kind that even experienced gankists will take hundreds of hours to learn. It’s been too much for poor Brendy, at any rate.
Still, Brendy is but one man. What if we had but four men, working in tandem to crush lanes and flatten Patrons just as Gabe intended? To find out if Deadlock is indeed more comprehensible as a team sport, Graham, Ed, Ollie, and James joined forces, promptly getting fucked up yet emerging from the warlock hospital with a deeper understanding of its workings. Or, at least, if anyone would keep playing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When nightmarish sci-fi extraction shooter The Forever Winter launched into early access in September it was somewhat messy. Bugs and maddening enemy spawns diminished the tension of being a fleshy human scavenger in a mech battlefield. But one feature annoyed some players much more - fresh water. See, you need to keep your headquarters stocked with water, as it gets steadily used by your settlement's inhabitants. The catch being that this water diminishes even while you're not playing the game. If it runs out completely, then everything you've collected gets wiped. The developers have listened to complaints about this most Farmville of mechanics, and they've answered in an interesting way. Water thieves! Now, on top of the usual downward trickle, burglars will come to steal your H2O as well.
It's not as bad as it sounds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Critics of Italy's Piracy Shield are not difficult to find but, with its powerful and influential proponents rarely far away, getting heard is a considerable challenge. Not to mention getting anything done. After calling for the platform's suspension and meeting resistance in the wake of the recent Google Drive blocking blunder, AGCOM board member Elisa Giomi has gone public with a laundry list of concerns. It pulls zero punches.

I need to avoid any complicated write-ups, or my brain will detonate similarly and paint north London grey.
Ah, a minigolf game! I think I can just about hack the concept of minigolf, on this most desperate of Mondays. It is golf but mini. Bonzai golf. Digestible! Intuitive! Why, I've managed to write 100 words without even looking at the Steam page. Let's do so now. Wait a minute, this isn't minigolf. It's Mini Mini Golf Golf. What is Mini Mini Golf Golf? "Destabilize the present and plunge into a neon psychohistory of a bizarre entity in distress," the Steam page explains. "This is not a game about minigolf." It is too late to flee.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was excited for Slitterhead, an action adventure game by Bokeh Studio, a studio founded by none other than your boy Keiichiro Toyama: the creator of Silent Hill, Gravity Rush, and the Siren series. And within that first hour, Slitterhead's body-possessing and Hong Kong-inspired streets had me thinking, "Is this it, the sleeper hit of 2024?!"
No, sadly not. It's no doubt built a compelling universe filled with brain-sucking aliens that masquerade as humans, and it attempts plenty else besides: bouncing between bodies as you stealth around dingy apartment blocks, fighting with blood katanas, and gorging on pools of red plasma to refuel skills, many of which require more body-flitting. Thing is, they are ultimately just attempts, attempts that fall victim to an emptiness and jitteriness that quickly reveals Slitterhead's true, irritating form.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I didn’t get much further in the extremely popular beta for the haute-couture-asaurus action of Monster Hunter Wilds than perfecting the exact orange-to-white ratio of my cat. Not because I wasn’t having fun, but because I immediately started looking up GPU prices after playing for ten minutes. As such, I didn’t spend enough time with the combat to get a proper feel for it. Cultural osmosis has once again allowed me to form an uneducated take, however, and I’m getting the sense there’s been some mixed reactions re: bonk quality. According to a clip shared on X by user Blue Stigma, there's a good reason for those misgivings. It's all about frames, you see.

This most specific of litmus tests has served me well, although I must admit that I’d happily upgrade it to ‘shopkeepers you can attack’, would that not disqualify 99% of games. But not turn based dungeon crawler Thysiastery, it turns out. This “dungeon crawler RPG featuring traditional roguelike and turn-based gameplay” apparently trusts you enough to let you recklessly batter its friendly wandering lizard merchants. You’d be a monster for it, of course, but it’s nice to have options.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Put your hand up if you'd forgotten that every Assassin's Creed game is, strictly speaking, set in the present day. I know I had. That's not the actual distant past you're parkouring through. That isn't actual Renaissance architecture you're clambering on. It's a holographic Animus simulation, conjured from ancestral memories flash-frozen within your DNA - convenient, inasmuch as it means that any inconsistencies are your DNA's fault, not Ubisoft's. If the ledge-mantling animations are glitchy, that's simply because you have bad genes.
We can both be forgiven for losing sight of Assassin's Creed's modern day narrative frame. Ubisoft themselves have downplayed it since the era of Desmond Miles, the watery Peter Parker figure who served as puppetmaster protagonist for AC games up to Assassin's Creed 3. In Assassin's Creed Shadows, however, they're planning to bring back the modern day setting in a big way, though details are scanty.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[People have asked me, a Call Of Duty liker, "How's the new COD?" - such is the mass appeal of Call Of Duty that even a lot of my non-industry pals are invested in whether Black Ops 6's shooty really does bang. And every single time my brain clunks into gear and I turn inwards, where I struggle to come up with anything meaningful to say. So much so that a fog develops and out of the fog emerges a figure - it's me. I'm holding an M4A1 with an extended barrel and a vertical foregrip. My brain and body perform a pincer movement of physical response: 1) I shrug 2) I say, "It's like Call Of Duty".

But I don’t think anyone expected Dragon Age: The Veilguard to be, at least on a purely technical level, one of the smoothest-performing, settings-rich AAA PC releases of the year so far.

Speaking as somebody who would quite like there to be more Alan Wake games - or at least, moderately weird and pretty decent blockbuster singleplayer horror games - I am both pleased by this news and a little troubled that Remedy's eldritch forest fable (which came out in October 2023) has yet to break even.

What can a description achieve save to clumsily gesture at the true shape of something; a dog-eared tour brochure for a thrilling weekend spelunking in Plato’s cave? I can usually shake this feeling, but gory zombie action game Showa American Story is my breaking point. There is nothing I can impart about this thing that will not be conveyed better by allowing its new trailer to wash over you like a tide of sheer videogame. Here’s it:

I have nobody to impress most days but my cat, and the only item of clothing she appears to have an opinion on is my Oodie, which is very comfortable for both of us and also smells like a chicken shop, which I imagine is more pleasant for her than me.
This aside, I found myself taking a whole bunch of Dragon Age: The Veilguard screenshots as I played just to capture the RPG’s various outfits. They are ridiculous. Incredibly intricate and detailed, as well as being obscenely impractical for the most part. I do not like any of them in the sense I would wear them, but I like all of them in the sense that they display artists allowed to run free like caffeinated weasels and indulge their every whim.

Sadly, this also means the Valve handheld is the primary casualty when developers decide to stop bothering with Linux support, as Respawn Entertainment have decided to do for Apex Legends.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Part of the fun of Dragon Age's fantasy is that it's inconsistent - or at least, inconsistent by the standards of fantasy RPGs, which often break down into a million neatly organised and interlocking codex entries. It all rides on who you speak to. The humans believe one thing about the origins and workings of Thedas, the elves another, the qunari something else entirely. These differences are the basis for many factional disagreements and thus, many core series plot developments. According to former lead writer David Gaider, however, there's an "uber-plot" behind it all that may one day be resolved and bring the series to a close, assuming BioWare continue to refer to his original (and closely guarded) narrative documents.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In what is believed to be the first case of its type in Japan, three men have been arrested for transcribing movies and then using the material without obtaining permission from rightsholders. Between January 2023 and February 2024, the men allegedly transcribed details of the Toho movie Godzilla Minus One and Kadokawa's Overlord III, before posting articles to a website as part of a conspiracy to unfairly generate advertising revenue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Almost ten years after Inquistion offered up a thrilling herb-harvesting adventure, today sees the release of Dragon Age: Veilguard. I’ve popped the release times below. The internet's Aged Dragons are naturally quite excited, and there’s been some lovely interactions over on Le Epic Musk Zone, where veteran Bioheads are celebrating the RPG studio’s history of animation quirks, specifically the ‘Bioware Turn’. Here’s a clip:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today in "person you already like says something you already agree with, but it’s still good to hear them say it" news, Arkane founder and im-simmy RPG studio WolfEye head Raphael Colantonio has spoken on Microsoft’s decision to shutter Prey (2017) studio Arkane Austin - alongside a handful of others - back in May.
Colantonio, who founded Arkane in 1999 and departed in 2017 to form Weird West studio WolfEye, recently chatted to Jeremy Peel for PC Gamer about Arkane’s closure, saying:
I think if you look a little bit, it's obvious that Arkane Austin was a very special group of people that have made some cool things and that could pull it off again. I think it was a decision that just came down to, 'We need to cut something.' Was it to please the investors, the stock market? They're playing a different game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my favourite satires is the Screwtape Letters, an epistolary novel by Narnia scribe C.S. Lewis. It consists of messages from an oily elder demon to his nephew about how to correctly groom the soul of an unsuspecting human being. It's a claustrophobic send-up of managerial politics and nepotism, with World War 1 unfolding in the background. A real pick-me-up. Sintopia is the Two Point incarnation of that premise - in other words, brighter and breezier and definitely more slapstick than Christian. It puts you in charge of a world divided between Earth and hell, and challenges you to ensure a steady movement of optimally sinful souls between one and the other. Say your prayers and watch the trailer.

I never finished it because my Xbox 360 version was not, in practice, an open world game, but a lonely farm at the bottom of a vortex of butchered spacetime. In the prologue, reformed outlaw John Marston confronts an old bandit acquaintance and gets himself roundly shot to bits. He’s rescued by local rancher Bonnie MacFarlane, who nurses him back to health and gives him a few odd jobs to warm him up for the next plot point.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are excited to announce that Rise of the Dragon  is now ready for public testing. This is the first of a small number of games built using the DGDS (Dynamix Game Development System) engine.
The Dynamix name may be familiar – bought by Sierra in 1990, the Dynamix brand continued and became well known for action and puzzle games like The Incredible Machine, A10 Tank Killer, and Red Baron.  They also made a few adventures using the custom DGDS engine.
Rise of the Dragon is set in Los Angeles in a dark version of the future, circa 2053.  You play as Blade Hunter, a private investigator and retired police officer.  After a designer drug kills the mayor's rebellious daughter, Chandra, Hunter is hired to find the people responsible for releasing the drug on the streets. What Blade ultimately finds is much more than he expected.  Rise of the Dragon combines classic point-and-click adventure style with platforming arcade sequences, giving a unique gameplay combination.
You’ll need the latest daily build of ScummVM and files from the DOS version of the game, which you can buy at GOG (check our wiki for the required data files).  Please file any issues you notice on our bug tracker.
