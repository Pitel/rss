The selection for this month is a solid selection of indie gems, both new and old. Coffee Talk arrives today, letting you play barista to a host of creatures in alt-Seattle. Opus: Echo of Starsong arrives later on, bringing a vibrant art style and deep narrative to the service.
A notable arrival this month on Game Pass is Immortality, the new FMV adventure from Sam Barlow and Half Mermaid. It was pretty impressive when I previewed it, and seems like it…]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-08-16T22:00:21.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You only need one button
Ninja or Die is a peculiar name for a game, but I took a look at the ninja-slaying roguelite on Steam and I'm intrigued by... all of this. It's so fast and flashy, I can hardly keep up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94IVbgfT0p0
I've watched the trailer for Ninja or Die a few times now, and I'm still piecing it together; slow-mo helps, but I doubt it will fully click until we've tried playing it.
Nao Games and Marvelous Europe are hoping to blend "hardcore action" with "simple controls," and I'm curious to see how that will pan out once the training wheels are off. Specifically, Ninja or Die uses one-button controls. "Jump to where you point, eviscerate the enemy by dashing through them, and hold to attack with greater power."
The setup is that you're a secret agent in a "ninja-eat-ninja world" with bosses to bring down and hordes of smaller creeps to cut through. As a roguelite experience, death is a part of the deal and you'll accumulate perma-upgrades as well as alternate characters. You can power up your stats back at the village or "pay the back-alley doctor."
[caption id="attachment_340023" align="alignnone" width="1920"] Those pesky Big Kite Ninjas.[/caption]
As opposed to some recent roguelites, Ninja or Die seems to emphasize high scores and replayability over a loop-based format that's servicing a larger story. On that note, levels are "a mix" of procedural and hand-crafted, and there's an Infinite Watchtower to run.
The pieces might not all add up in the end, but the strangeness appeals to me. I just hope that when I'm the one leaping around Japan like a madman, I have a better sense of my busy surroundings. From the outside looking in, readability is a concern.
As luck would have it, there's a browser-based demo to get a feel for it.
Another one for the wait-and-see wishlist? I think so.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Guild Wars 2 celebrates its 10th anniversary this month, and ArenaNet is celebrating by introducing the MMORPG to a new audience on Steam. 
On Tuesday, August 23, Guild Wars 2 will be available on a third-party platform for the first time ever. Since its launch in August 2012, the game has only been accessible through ArenaNet’s proprietary launcher. Guild Wars 2 on Steam will retain its subscription-less, free-to-play model. Additionally, Steam players and those on the original client will play together on the same servers. If you’re a newcomer wanting to catch up on a decade’s worth of content, a $99.97 Complete Edition of the game for Steam bundles Guild Wars 2’s three expansions and all five seasons.
ArenaNet is introducing Twitch Drops. Now you can earn exclusive in-game character outfits, experience boosters, and a special Glowing Purple Mask cosmetic by watching streamers play the game from August 23-28. 


“Guild Wars 2 has delighted over 16 million players for a decade with its subscription-free business model, epic collaborative open-world boss encounters, and revolutionary mount system,” said Kendall Boyd, Senior Vice President of Marketing at NCSOFT West. “By launching on Steam, a whole new audience of players who have never had the chance to adventure with us will be able to experience one of the greatest fantasy worlds in gaming. Everyone at NCSOFT and ArenaNet is excited to welcome them into our amazing community.”
Guild Wars 2 has been hailed as one of the best MMOs of its time. ArenaNet has supported the title with seasonal updates and expansion packs, the latest being February’s End of Dragons.
Do you still play Guild Wars 2? Will you be picking it up on Steam to dive in for the first time? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

A game set in the Wild West that also lets me fight vampires? Sounds like a blast to me, and it's exactly what we're getting from Flying Wild Hog's newest title Evil West. The game was originally set to release next month on September 20, but per publisher Focus Entertainment's official Twitter page, they just announced that Evil West will be delayed an extra two months to November 22, 2022, to achieve the level of polish they need for the game's five-platform release.

The Switch is having a good year for animal-based beat-'em-ups (Kaiju! Turtles! Uh... Girls?), and Jitsu Squad, the upcoming release from ININ Games, looks set to add to it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How to make sure all those fancy skins transfer over
Overwatch 2 is just a few months away. We've known that Overwatch 2 will have cross-progression for a while, and today Blizzard is explaining just how all of it will work.
Cross-progression means that all progression and in-game cosmetics in Overwatch 2 will span across different systems. While previously having, say, a fancy Tracer skin on PlayStation 4 didn't mean you could access it on PC, the new system will merge and allow you to use the skin on both.
Starting today on August 16, players with a linked console account will be allowed to identify and confirm the accounts they want to merge. Once approved, the accounts will be prepared to merge on Overwatch 2's release. You'll need a Battle.net account no matter what, and all progress from the linked accounts will be stored on the Battle.net account.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aB-H8QFXA0
As Blizzard notes with red text and emphasis, there is just one opportunity to merge accounts. Make sure you check which accounts are being merged when you do so.
The Blizzard explainer goes into further detail, including addressing a few specific circumstances some players might run into during the merge process. All of this should serve to provide a central platform, similar to games like Fortnite, where cosmetics purchased in one place will be available on the others as well.
One giant closet of cosmetics
As Overwatch 2 moves the game from loot boxes to passes and a shop, having that access is a good thing. It's doubly so, since Overwatch 2 will also be taking the place of Overwatch on its launch; like a massive title update for the multiplayer side. The single-player part of Overwatch 2, meanwhile, is expected to arrive sometime later on in the future.
Overwatch 2 will go live and free-to-play on October 4 for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.

We love the Switch. It's a pretty neat piece of kit after all. But that doesn't mean we don't have issues with the console or think it could do with an update or two every so often. And we've come up with another improvement that we think would make multiplayer even easier.
Who used Download Play on their DS or 3DS? We played so much Mario Kart DS with our friends using this feature that we really miss it. Being able to play games with someone even if they don't have their own copy is amazing. But the Switch doesn't have this — only Namco Museum and Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Games do something similar. The former has a multiplayer-only version that's free (but it only has Pac-Man Vs. which is the only multiplayer game in that collection), and the latter has a Local Multiplayer Guest Edition which you can download from the eShop.

In the home stretch before the 1.0 release of Grounded on September 27, Obsidian announced a Shared Worlds feature to make multiplayer less of a hassle.
Here's the idea: You'll be able to create a Shared World that lives in the cloud and lets other players hop in even when you aren't around to host it. In other words, less time getting everyone's schedule on the same page, and more time smashing bugs.

It's time for another over-the-top, explosive trailer for Bandai Namco's upcoming JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: All Star Battle R. The beat 'em up, which is a remaster of a 2013 PS3 game, launches next month on Switch, and we're now being given lessons in preparation for the game's release.
In typical Jojo style, however, it's not a straightforward showcase of the game's many modes or abilities, oh no. Narrated by Rohan Kishibe and Koichi Hirose — from the Diamond is Unbreakable arc — the two characters give us a rather enthusiastic rundown on just what's coming to the remaster.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The studio is ramping up even more
Team Asobi seems to have big plans on the horizon. In the wake of launching its latest game, Astro's Playroom, as a PlayStation 5 pack-in title, its next project will be its biggest one yet.
In a new interview with GamesIndustry.biz, creative and studio director Nicolas Doucet talks about some of what Asobi's been up to post-Playroom. Team Asobi is looking to keep tooling around with the DualSense, a key part of Astro's Playroom. And it's also looking to expand in scope, too.
Doucet says Asobi's next game will follow in the footsteps of its previous games, will be a full-blown commercial title, and will be the "biggest to date" for the studio.
The team at Asobi has been steadily expanding, going from 35 to 60 members. Doucet expects that number to reach around 100. And the makeup is largely Japanese, which Doucet says the team wants to reflect in the games they make.
"We want to make sure that when people play our games that there is a feeling, and you can't quite put your finger on it, that it's made in Japan," said Doucet. You can find the full interview with GIbiz here.

Astro's evolution
Team Asobi has been on a steady rise for some time. Astro Bot Rescue Mission was considered one of the better PlayStation VR games around. And Astro's Playroom was a delightful pack-in console launch game. The platformer harbored tons of nostalgia for the history of PlayStation and its hardware.
Doucet and the team at Asobi have a clear penchant for working with the nuances of Sony's hardware. The studio lead says there's an extra team on the side at Asobi, always working on the technology and R&D. Where Asobi goes with the DualSense and its next big project, its biggest yet, will be exciting to see.

The act of 'demaking' games has become a rather popular endeavour in recent memory, with Game Boy Demakes on Twitter showcasing numerous impressive attempts to authentically recreate popular games with the handheld console's visual aesthetics.
The latest game to receive the 'demake' treatment is Koji Igarashi's Castlevania-inspired adventure Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night, which released on the Switch in 2019. The game itself - rather contentiously - opted for a 2.5D approach to its visuals, which disappointment many fans at the time due to the obvious nods towards Konami's seminal masterpiece, Castlevania: Symphony of the Night.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Knights of the Old Republic remake sounds like it may be running into some trouble, but fans of the original classic BioWare game have reason to celebrate. Celebrated collectibles maker Gentle Giant is prepping a new statue depicting one of the central characters of the original game. Jedi Knight Bastila Shan has never looked better.
The action-posed figure depicts Bastila Shan in battle with a Guardian Droid in the ruins of Dantooine, one of the early sites players visited in the game. The statue is made of PVC, and looks to feature some impressive sculpting and paint work. The yellow-hued double-bladed lightsaber in mid-swing is a particular highlight.

If it’s been a few years since you ventured into the classic Star Wars RPG, Bastila Shan was a Jedi Master many thousands of years before the events of the Skywalker Saga. Among other gifts provided by the Force, she had the rare capability known as battle meditation, which could be used to boost her allies and demoralize her enemies. At one point, she was tortured and turned to the dark side by Darth Malak, and the player is given a choice of how to interact with her – including options to redeem or kill her.
The new statue is steering toward launch in spring of 2023, but pre-orders open in just a few days, on 8/19 over at Gentle Giant’s official site. Suggested retail price is 80 republic credits, or $80 if you prefer your local currency.]]></summary>

For the good of all of us — except the ones who are dead — I am going to talk about Portal. It's a puzzle game. It's a 3D first-person shooter. It's a comedy about untrustworthy robot overlords. And yes, it's a modern classic, and yes, I hadn't played it in full until recently. That's what Backlog Club is for! Leave me alone!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard announced that cross-progression is coming to Overwatch 2, and starting today, you can merge multiple accounts onto a single profile. 
With Overwatch 2 set to release on Oct. 4, which is also when the game will replace the original Overwatch, now’s a great time to get all your cosmetics, loot boxes, and more in order. It’s also a great time to merge some accounts so that you can, for example, jump between playing on PC and PlayStation freely. Fortunately, Blizzard made that possible today because you now merge multiple accounts. 
“With the launch of cross-progression, players can merge multiple Overwatch accounts to carry progression and in-game cosmetics into Overwatch 2 on a single profile,” a press release reads. “Starting Aug. 16, every player with a linked console account will be prompted at login to identify, select, and confirm the accounts you want to merge. Once you approve, we will prepare you accounts to be merged during the release of Overwatch 2.
“All players will need a battle.net account to play Overwatch 2, regardless of platform. Progress from linked console accounts will be stored on your battle.net accounts, which will share in-game cosmetics and progress across the linked accounts.”

Ebay is running a promotion today that knocks 15% off the price of brand-new items when you use the code BANK15 at the checkout, and you can use this to pick an RTX 3060 12GB for just £279. 
This is a great price for this mid-range GPU, and it's especially rare to see features like hardware-accelerated ray tracing and DLSS image reconstruction at this price point.

And from our first playfully animated look at Bloody Hell Hotel, there's much to do.
The announcement trailer debuted on IGN today, and it moves fast.

The coming weekend will see the 10th iteration of the tournament, once again hosted by West Midlands FGC Electronic Dojo, return to the Millennium Point complex in Birmingham for three days of sweet 'n' salty action.

Well, the teaser was sent out, and now the time has come: Dragon Ball is entering Fortnite. Here's how the Dragon Ball x Fortnite event works.

Currently, Epic has implemented two big items into the mix:
Nimbus Cloud (an on-demand glider that lets you shoot into the air to glide with a cooldown timer, similar to other past items)
Kamehameha (an ability that's essentially an explosive beam, governed by a maximum of three charges)
You can find these items either through special vendors (Bulma at Kame House on the far east of the map in the island formation), "Dragon Ball" vending machines (marked on the map), or through capsules, which appear on the map like supply drops.

Blossom Tales: The Sleeping King was one of the early Switch success stories that showed how vital the system would be for indie developers. After being largely ignored on PC, the game dropped on the Switch eShop in December 2017 and sold more copies on the platform in one day than in the roughly nine months it had been available on Steam. The move actually saved the fledgling indie studio, and five years later, Castle Pixel is bringing players back to the world of Lily, Chrys, and Grandpa with Blossom Tales II: The Minotaur Prince.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Late bloomer.
In the first year of the Switch’s life, it was relatively common to see massive indie success stories from developers who managed to get their game on the eShop before the veritable torrent of new game releases — many of them excellent — flooded the store on a weekly basis. One of these titles was Blossom Tales, a cute action game that wasn’t even remotely shy about how heavily it was cribbing from the playbook of The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. After the enormous and unexpected success of Blossom Tales saved the development team from having to shut down, work began on Blossom Tales 2, and we’re happy to report that this sophomore effort is every bit as enjoyable as the original — although it’s also just as derivative.
Here the narrative once again takes place as a ‘story within a story’, as an elderly man tells his two eager grandchildren a tale that features both of them as characters, with Lily, a brave warrior, living with her obnoxious brother in a fantasy land. The two start out participating in all sorts of fun at a nearby fair, but a petty sibling squabble causes Lily to wish that the evil Minotaur King would come and take her brother somewhere far away. Somehow, this causes the real Minotaur King to show up and do just that, which kicks off her quest across the land to reclaim her brother and defeat the evil king.

The Yamauchi No 10 Family Office, a group formed of members of Nintendo's founding family, is looking to buy out marine engineering company Toyo Construction, with the stated aim of helping to make the oceans cleaner, the Financial Times reports (paywall).
The Yamauchi family, who owns and recently renovated Nintendo's original HQ as a boutique hotel, put up an offer to buy the 93-year-old engineering firm back in April. It already has a 27% stake in Toyo Construction, but this offer seeks to buy the company outright and use it to "tackle profound global challenges", chief investment officer Hirowaka Murakami says.

Wave Race 64 ruled the roost in so many houses across the world, and now, over 20 years later, it's back via Nintendo Switch Online.
Set to arrive on the service on August 19, Wave Race 64 joins a smallish group of Nintendo 64 classics that are all part of the "Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack" family. While the rate of games is incredibly slow, the choices have been fairly on-point most months, especially when it comes to this beloved oddity.
I mean, the intended effect of putting a lot of these games on modern platforms is...content and adding value to a subscription service. But games like Wave Race 64 just highlight how many franchises Nintendo is sitting on and doing nothing with. It's been over 20 years since we've seen a true sequel, and a return could easily work as a downloadable arcade-esque game. Just announce it at a Nintendo Direct, potentially during E3, and you're good to go.
You can watch the trailer below! Speaking of, these types of trailers rule, because they're bringing old games back in a new way. It's a different type of game preservation, and I dig it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Actually, several things are missing.
When something is described as 'ultimate', you'd be forgiven for thinking that this essentially means "the best of the best', or "the most complete package". Heck, just look at the cast of Danganronpa; they're the "ultimate" in their respective fields, showcasing talents that no one else could possibly match, right?
So when Sega launched the "Ultimate Sonic Bundle" on the Switch eShop just yesterday, it's quite natural to assume that this encompasses all major Sonic releases on the Switch. As a reminder, this consists of Sonic Mania, Sonic Forces, Team Sonic Racing, Sonic Colours Ultimate, and the recently released Sonic Origins. You've also got the Sega Ages branded releases of Sonic the Hedgehog and Sonic the Hedgehog 2 for good measure, if you're a completionist.

You can watch the zany footage below.


According to Gamespot, two bundles touting skins inspired by popular characters will be available for purchase. The cosmetics include Goku, Vegeta, and Bulma with alternate styles, Beerus, and back bling items like Seer Fish, Power Pole, Kamesennin’s Shill, and two new Pickaxes. Nimbus and Space Pod gliders also appear with an anime-themed Kamehameha attack to decimate foes the Saiyan way. Finally, creative maps contain cool locations like Kami’s Palace, Goku’s House, the Room of Spirit and Time, and more. 
The description of the event reads as follows:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Excellent roguelikelike dungeon crawler Backpack Hero launched into early access this week, and it's absolutely worth a go if you enjoy shuffle items around your inventory grid. Backpack Hero is all about arranging weapons and items inside your massive sack to develop powerful synergies, see. Some items buff items touching them, while others benefit from empty spaces, or some insist upon being in a certain grid row, and some even move around by themselves. The buildcrafting gets fiendishly fun as your critter delves deeper into dungeons in search of a giant hunk of cheese.

Developer Ravenscourt has today announced that the latest addition in their karaoke series, Let's Sing 2023, will be coming back to Switch. The first teaser trailer can be found above, and while it provides no release date just yet, it does tease some of the artists and 30 songs that you will be able to find on the game.
Listing off some classic karaoke artists such as Avril Lavigne ("Complicated", of course), Ed Sheeran ("Bad Habits"), and Jason Derulo ("Acapulco") alongside modern-day pop royalty including Billie Eilish ("Happier Than Ever") and Lil Nas X (Old Town Road), the playlist is sure to have us reaching for the high notes — we've got form when it comes to Lavigne. “Your Song” by Rita Ora and Charlie Puth's “How Long?” will also feature.

In my four decades of gaming, there have been very few 'new' genres, and even fewer that have proven to have lasting staying power. Aside from the phenomenon that is Battle Royale, there is probably only one 21st-century-birthed genre that has proven itself with consistent and cemented success with developers, player communities, and cash registers: The Soulslike.
A sub-genre of RPGs, Soulslikes generally feature grim, deep lore, an emphasis on exploration, build-heavy protagonists, and a typically gloomy, gothic aesthetic. Oh, and they're also hard as nails. And yet, despite their punishing difficulty, steep learning curve, and joyless demeanor, the Soulslike genre has enraptured a huge community of devotees, won over by FromSoftware epics such as Demon's Souls, Bloodb…]]></summary>

The Kingdom of Hermes has fallen into an age of calamity. In a world where the use of powerful alchemy was once widespread and welcomed, things have gone terribly wrong. The now blood-soaked streets are filled with plague-ridden monstrosities and it's up to you, Corvus, to take out the mutated trash.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chat Shit, Get Banged
I'm a Senior Editor and I can consider anything as Front Page news. Here is some Front Page News.
Capcom has released a new walkout video for Street Fighter 6, giving us a quick glimpse of the recently revealed World Warriors Juri and Kimberly as they make their way to the field of battle. The intro vid-cum-loading screen will follow the two selected fighters as they step into the ring accompanied by some characterful animations and SF6's dopey, but adorable, "Game Face" staredown screen.
In the clip, we see the Korean taekwondo expert and former assassin Juri as she "chats mad shit", (Flanx's words), to her opponent. Newcomer Kimberly has no time for such mind games, instead taking the moment to hype up the crowd and perform some fancy ninja acrobatics. In a cute tough, Kimberly overshoots the camera and has to awkwardly scurry back into shot. That's fun.
https://twitter.com/StreetFighter/status/1559329092675047425?s=20&t=RegOKDHCGSEuw2ArBLaX9g
The Game Face screen then slams into view, with Juri's punk rock sneer and puffed, grumpy cheeks meeting Kimberly's sarcastic gurn and knowing smile. It's a weird old mechanic, that's for sure, but I'll absolutely take it all over Street Fighter V's charisma-free presentation style. It will be fun to see all of the SF6 roster interact in such a fashion, though I imagine, for the most part, Juri is going to be going ignored by her opposition for most of these walkouts.
Street Fighter 6 launches in 2023 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms — while you wait, please check out our previous coverage, including our looks at Juri and Kimberly, our comments on Capcom's approach to the sequel's marketing, and our popular Five Do's and Do Not Do's feature.

Ship of Fools is the latest co-op game to catch my eye, and if you liked Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime, this "aquapocalypse"-canceling adventure might speak to you too. Sailing alone or with a mate, you'll fire off cannons and swat creatures on deck.
Team17 and Fika Productions released a new trailer and announced the big day. Ship of Fools lands on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch on November 22, 2022.

The holiday season is coming, and with it Ragnarok. Or, at least, God of War Ragnarok. And since it's been a few years since 2018's God of War, a story recap might be of some use to folks as they gear up for the winter.
PlayStation published a new video today, which recaps the story of Kratos and Atreus from the 2018 God of War. The storyteller walking us through it? None other than The Guild's own Felicia Day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjucT-UZzgg
The rhyming tale takes a brief tour through the main story beats of God of War, pausing for a few jokes and asides from in-universe character Mimir. And while it doesn't cover every single beat, it does a pretty good job summing up Kratos and Atreus' journey, as well as some of the conflicts that arose and still persist headed into Ragnarok.
Winter is coming
It's a good refresher to have too, as even though God of War was only a 2018 game, it does feel like eons ago to me at this point. Remembering the reason why Freya, for instance, has a bone to pick with Kratos seems like some important topical study material given some of the Ragnarok teases we've seen.
God of War Ragnarok is locked in for November 9, 2022. It's also one of the few games still in the holiday window, as more and more have been delayed out into the next year. Open-world wizarding RPG Hogwarts Legacy recently pushed back to February, and Marvel's Midnight Suns is on an undetermined delay as of this writing.
Regardless, I'm really interested to see where the story goes from here, and how Sony Santa Monica Studios' interpretation of Norse mythology carries on. God of War Ragnarok arrives on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 on September 9, 2022.

Most of the achievements and trophies in Cult of the Lamb are only a matter of time, but I was nervous about needing to topple the main bosses without taking any damage to unlock "Order," "Sate," "Cure," and "Peace." After trading blows with every bishop in my original playthrough, I figured there had to be some way to initiate a rematch — the notion of needing to start a new save seemed out of whack with the rest of the game's player-friendly tendencies. Thankfully, there is a way to replay bosses, and it's quick.
Early on, you might've destroyed many of the bishop statues that appear in dungeons since 1) other breakable objects can give you resources for your base and 2) it's inherently fun to smash shit. At a certain point, I stopped doing this — that was my m…]]></summary>

One of the most fun things about following a bunch of game developers on Twitter is that you get to see the process of how some really cool indie games are made. That's exactly what happened to me with Dan DeEntremont's upcoming project Squirrel with a Gun — and yes, that's exactly what it sounds like.
The first I saw of this awesome game was a viral tweet from back in May of this year, where he showed off the first time he got fur on the squirrel. The whole thing looks insanely realistic, and obviously, the fact that the little fluffy rodent was holding and firing a gun caught everyone's attention. (I mean, who doesn't love a game with a fluffy, adorable protagonist.)
https://twitter.com/QuiteDan/status/1525631771387338757
Of course, the game has developed a whole lot more in the past few months, and it's pretty fun to scroll through DeEntremont's Twitter page and see all of the progress videos compiled in one spot.
Squirrel with a Gun has rightfully gotten a lot of attention over the past few months, because I haven't seen a game capture the internet's sense of humor so accurately in a long time. Now the game has finally been listed on Steam, and while we may not have any kind of release window yet, it's cool to see a small developer making bits steps like that. I know I'm adding it to my wish list.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRz15LfZjBI
Squirrel with a Gun is a testament to how social media has changed the landscape for indie developers in a big way. DeEntremont has been able to make this entire project by himself (at least to my knowledge) and garnered a huge following for it simply because he had a funny idea and the gumption to pull it off.
Here's hoping that indie devs continued to be inspired by seeing others succeed like this, because the more goofy indie games there are in my life, the better.

I only knew two things before purchasing 2007’s Heavenly Guardian on PS2. First, it was going to be a game in the Pocky & Rocky series, only maybe not really. It looked to be aiming more at Kiki Kaikai, which the Pocky & Rocky games are the sequels to, but I’m not going to get into the finer details of why they’re almost two separate series. The quick version is this: Kiki Kaikai is Taito; Pocky & Rocky is Natsume. Yes, this means that Pocky & Rocky with Becky is more a part of the Kiki Kaikai series.
Anyway, that’s boring. The second thing I knew about Heavenly Guardian going into it is that it’s considered to be kusoge.

It's also just a damn fine mechanical keyboard, with a comfortable 60% size, bright RGB lighting and premium PBT keycaps. 
You normally pay a lot for this kind of quality and functionality - £150, in fact - but today the keyboard has dropped to its lowest ever price of £97.94 over at Amazon UK.

The D23 Expo is coming up, and with it a bunch of Disney and Marvel reveals. Alongside the movies and series, the games of Disney and Marvel are getting spotlighted in a showcase on September 9.
The Disney & Marvel Games Showcase will air on Sept. 9 at 1 p.m. PT / 4 p.m. ET. Hosted by Kinda Funny's Blessing Adeoye Jr., it will feature updates on several projects currently in the works.
Those showing off new content include Disney & Pixar Games, Marvel Games, Lucasfilm Games, and 20th Century Games. New reveals from farming life-sim Disney Dreamlight Valley, tactical hero game Marvel's Midnight Suns, and Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga are all in store.
We'll also get a sneak peek at the upcoming Marvel game from Skydance New Media. That's the studio that Uncharted's Amy Hennig is leading up, which is working on both a Marvel and Star Wars project.
"The Marvel Universe epitomizes all the action, mystery and thrills of the pulp adventure genre that I adore and lends itself perfectly to an interactive experience," said Hennig when the Marvel project was announced last year. "It’s an honor to be able to tell an original story with all the humanity, complexity, and humor that makes Marvel characters so enduring and to enable our players to embody these heroes that they love."

Games showcases, assemble
Both Disney and Marvel have had a strong video game presence over the years. And now, it's joining in on the summer of gaming showcases.
It's not the only company with a showcase in September, either. Ubisoft is planning to host an Ubisoft Forward the day after this Disney and Marvel showcase, on September 10. An open-world Star Wars game is in development at Ubisoft, headed by Massive Entertainment. Whether we see that or not, it looks like there's a good chunk of gaming news happening in September.

But now, new court docs reveal that the PS4 reportedly sold more than twice as well as the Xbox One, according to Microsoft.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some of the late-hits are toned down, though
Arcade1Up has another retro-revival arcade cabinet on the way, and this one's for the sports fans. The new NFL Blitz Legends cabinet combines three remasters of the popular over-the-top NFL Blitz series.
The three games in the cabinet are 1997's NFL Blitz, 1998's NFL Blitz '99, and NFL Blitz 2000: Gold Edition from 1999. All three are remastered in the cabinet, which will go for $599.
The cabinet features Arcade1Up's usual details, like full side art and a matching riser. Four spots are open for play too, so you can get the whole crew on the sticks for some Blitz. And while it's good for local co-op, the Blitz cab also supports online multiplayer via Wi-Fi, as well as leaderboards.
For the cabinet, Arcade1UP partnered with the National Football League and Football Greats Alliance to feature all of the football greats. This includes Dan Marino, Jerry Rice, Deion Sanders, Brett Favre, Jerome Bettis, Terrell Davis, and Cris Carter.

Diving into the endzone
Some of the more rowdy violence has been a bit toned back, however. According to a press release, a specific set of tackles and after-the-whistle hits were removed or edited in the remastered versions of these three NFL Blitz games. These changes support the NFL's current Player Health and Safety Initiatives. So sorry, a little bit of the after-the-whistle shenanigans will be tuned down, as they've been in other releases.
This isn't the only big arcade cabinet announcement out of Arcade1Up in the last few weeks. The at-home cabinet designer also announced a Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 cabinet at Evo 2022, bringing the classic crossover and several other cross-franchise fighters together for a fighting game collection.
Pre-orders for the NFL Blitz cabinet are live here at the Arcade1Up site. Shipping is expected to start sometime in early October.

Fans of veteran tactical combat series Jagged Alliance are already getting their gear together for the long-awaited sequel Jagged Alliance 3, which is currently in development at studio Haemimont Games. Publisher THQ Nordic released a new trailer for the RTS title during this weekend's Digital Showcase.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah9O1LQXIvE
Once again set against the backdrop of Grand Chien, Jagged Alliance 3 sees the fictional republic overthrown by a dangerous paramilitary force following the mysterious disappearance of its president. As "The Legion" embeds itself within each and every sector of the troubled nation, the family of its missing ruler reaches out to the clandestine Adonis corporation to send its best team of black ops mercenaries to locate the president, defeat The Legion, and restore Grand Chien to its former state of (relative) order.
The new sequel, which will arrive a full two decades on from 1999's Jagged Alliance 2, will feature the tactical engagement and strategic gameplay of its predecessor, powered by a brand new engine and modern-day mechanics. A huge cast of new and familiar mercenaries will be made available for the player's home-grown militia, given access to a huge arsenal of weaponry, equipment, and explosive, town-rattling gear. Battle The Legion's forces, train local insurgents, and retake the Grand Chien street-by-street in explosive campaign action alone or with co-op support.
Jagged Alliance 3 is currently in development for PC. A release window has not been announced.

More specifically, the showcase will begin at 1 p.m. PT/4 p.m. ET on Friday, Sept. 9, and will be hosted by Kinda Funny's Blessing Adeoye Jr. It is set to feature "incredible new content" from Disney & Pixar Games, Marvel Games, Lucasfilm Games, and 20th Century Games. This includes titles like Disney Dreamlight Valley, Marvel's Midnight Suns, Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, and even a "sneak peek at the upcoming ensemble game from Skydance New Media."

You might recognize Skydance New Media as the studio where former Uncharted series director Amy Hennig works as president. Connecting those dots means the sneak peek at the upcoming ensemble game from Skydance New Media is the first sneak peek of Hennig's new game, which she revealed as a narrative-driven, action-adventure game last year. 
Considering it's an ensemble game, it could be any number of famous Marvel squads or families. However, it's probably a safe bet to assume it won't be the Avengers since Crystal Dynamic's Avengers is only two years old and still getting updates. We also know it won't be the Midnight Suns, as XCOM developer Firaxis is developing that. I'm hoping Hennig's game is based on the X-Men, but since it's an ensemble game, it could be something like the Inhumans, the Fantastic Four, or even the New Avengers, too. Only time will tell, but fortunately, we have less than a month of waiting to go because the Disney and Marvel Games Showcase airs on Sept. 9.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thanks, Nintendo
"Nintendo DLC" is still a weird phrase to utter out loud. At one point in the gaming landscape I never really seriously thought it would be a widespread option, but it's rampant enough now to the point where it can be considered part of the company's identity.
They adopted the practice a little over a decade ago on the 3DS, where it sometimes was implemented in a janky fashion. From there they expanded to the Wii U. And even then I wasn't used to it! But once Nintendo started doing regularly scheduled DLC for nearly all of its games on Switch, it all fell into place. I've accepted it.
Which leads me to this: an official Nintendo DLC tutorial video. If you're confused on how to buy more stuff, they have you covered! The below video walks folks through the steps of redeeming the free DLC offers via their Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack benefits. It's as simple as "going into the Switch Online menu, then scrolling down, looking at the benefits on offer, and clicking on them until you can hit a download button."
Right now that selection mostly involves Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and Splatoon 2 DLC. Of note, it does not involve Super Mario Bros. 35, which is still discontinued.

For one thing, they're always super expensive, and I'm trying to ball on a budget over here. I've also heard mixed things from my friends — for the most part, they say they're not super comfortable, although my roommate loves that it's nice and firm and makes them sit up straighter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["We're not considering that at this point"
Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa has been relatively accessible since he took over, and this past week, he spoke to financial outlet Nikkei about the lack of a Nintendo Switch price hike for the foreseeable future. Well, that's the plan anyway.
Furukawa noted that they are "not considering" a Nintendo Switch price hike "at this point," with two factors in play. The chief concern is "pricing people out," given that they're aiming to expand their market and play the long game (Nintendo has also comfortably been in a position of being the cheapest mainstream gaming hardware throughout its history).
Another potential way the blow has been softened is through software sales, given that Nintendo also produces games that they want to keep viable with a large install base. Nintendo says that they want to "maintain the momentum" of the Switch so far. The issue apparently isn't with the actual innards of the Switch, but rather that "demand exceeds supply."
So how are they staying the course without a price hike? Furukawa concedes that the "OLED model will continue to be less profitable than our other models," because "costs have undoubtedly increased for shipping not only by air, but also by sea." But he also notes: "The weak yen may be seen as a benefit for Nintendo, since such a large share of our sales comes from abroad, but our overseas promotional and staff costs also go up. We're making more inventory purchases in foreign currencies to counter that."

A new game set in the Lord of the Rings universe is on the way. Private Division has signed Weta Workshop to a new publishing agreement, for a new game set in J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth.
Weta Workshop is a well-known effects and prop company that worked on Peter Jackson's adaptation of The Lord of the Rings. The company founded an interactive game division in 2014, and now is tackling The Lord of the Rings in game form.
"It's a privilege to create a new game set in Middle-earth, especially one that's so different from what fans have played previously," said Amie Wolken, head of interactive at Weta Workshop, in a statement. "As fans ourselves, we're excited for gamers to explore Middle-earth in a way they never have before, and introduce new fans to the magic of The Lord of the Rings."
Details on the new project are scarce, as it's still in early development. No release date is set yet. But Private Division says the game is expected to launch sometime during Take-Two's 2024 fiscal year. More details will arrive sometime in the future.

Middle-earth's back on the menu, boys
Private Division is a publishing arm of Take-Two Interactive, and has been behind some notable games like OlliOlli World and The Outer Worlds. The company also acquired OlliOlli developer Roll7. It will also publish Ori developer Moon Studios' next game.
There are a few different Lord of the Rings projects in development. Whether you like to sneak around as a sneaky little Gollum on a quest for his precious, or dig into a survival-type game, there are a few Middle-earth projects to watch. We'll see what Weta brings to the table when it's ready to share more about its own interactive LOTR project.

If you’re escaping a dystopian prison system where you can pay to upgrade to invisible handcuffs, your escape may as well have a jamming soundtrack.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mindhack, an upcoming visual novel adventure, opens in a jail cell, as a criminal named Unid is brought before you by a pair of armed security guards. Your reputation precedes you: before the accused can even sit down, they call out your unusual ability to hack into the minds of people to ‘patch’ their flaws, turning their nefarious intentions into fields of flowers. But it’s ok, isn’t it? After all, the person in front of you has committed a crime and must be rehabilitated; reckless driving, hit and run, and arson.


So, you get to work. Talking to Unid allows you to build a rapport and understand their motivations. You learn about their past. They talk of their difficult childhood, pets, a lack of support - broken systems that left them behind and put them on their current path. It doesn’t matter. You have a job to do. And now, with that bit of knowledge, you’ve found the 'bug' in their programming. After initiating a hack on their brain, you eradicate this flaw, forcefully transforming their mind into a paradise of purity. Unid will never commit another crime again. Have you done the right thing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Private Division, a publishing arm under the Take-Two Interactive umbrella, has signed a publishing agreement with Wētā Workshop to publish the studio’s new Lord of the Rings game. 
Wētā Workshop is the VFX studio behind The Lord of the Rings trilogy directed by Peter Jackson, and in 2014, it founded a video game division. That team is now developing a “new game set in the Middle-earth universe of J.R.R. Tolkien,” according to a press release. Middle-earth Enterprises has licensed the literary works of the series to Wētā Workshop, too, giving the studio “the broadest creative license to interpret the underlying lore of the books.” 
“We are thrilled to partner with Wētā Workshop to publish a game set in such an extraordinary and celebrated universe,” Private Division head Michael Worosz writes in a press release. “The Lord of the Rings IP is home to so many remarkable stories, and no entity is better equipped than the team at Wētā Workshop to create a distinctive, new Middle-earth gaming experience.” 
Wētā Workshop’s gaming lead, Amie Wolken, says it's a privilege to create a new game set in Middle-earth, especially one that’s going to be “so different from what fans have played previously.” 
“As a fan ourselves, we’re excited for gamers to explore Middle-earth in a way they never have before, and introduce new fans to the magic of The Lord of the Rings,” Wolken writes in the press release. 
This new Lord of the Rings game does not yet have a title and is early in development. It doesn’t have a release date either, but it’s expected to launch sometime during Take-Two’s Fiscal Year 2024 (April 2023 - March 2024). 
While waiting to learn more about this game, check out the latest gameplay from The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, which was recently delayed out of its Sept. 1 release date by a few months. Watch this teaser from the upcoming Amazon Middle-earth TV show, The Lord of the Rings:​ The Rings of Power, after that.

The movie seems to be early in development, although it did land Takashi Doscher as its writer earlier this year, but we might have some new information about it straight from a recent interview with Stehelski. 
More specifically, Stehelski revealed to Collider that the movie might feature an entirely Japanese cast and that the film could be in Japanese. Plus, he says Sony is on board with the idea. Here’s what he had to say:
This sounds awesome, but with the project being so early in development, anything could change. It’s great to hear that Sony’s on board with the idea, though!

That's Circus Electrique, a turn-based RPG that's much more lighthearted than its Darkest Dungeon counterpart (and seemingly main inspiration). But after playing a preview of the game’s first mission, there's more than meets the eye in this part steampunk RPG, part circus tycoon management sim.
You play as Amelia, a young, bold journalist returning to London to cover the grand re-opening of the Circus Electrique. A metaphorical spanner gets lobbed into the works, however, as the ceremony is interrupted with news that London’s citizens have started attacking each other (more than your average fisticuffs to get on the tube). Oddly, this doesn’t seem to have affected Amelia and your motley circus troupe, who venture out into London’s dangerous streets to find answers.

The developer filed a copyright lawsuit against the alleged operator of Lavicheats in 2021 but almost a year later progress is slow. In addition to conducting discovery in the US, Bungie has an eye on the UK but whether that will bear fruit is another question.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let’s rock, baby! Season 6 of Video Gameography gets stylish as we examine the Devil May Cry series! Over the next few weeks, we’ll be covering the history and lore of Capcom’s premiere action franchise, and this episode takes aim at the lauded yet somewhat polarizing Devil May Cry 4. 
Devil May Cry 4 took the series to a new generation of hardware, including Xbox for the first time. That's only one of the many firsts for this entry. Capcom moved Dante aside to place newcomer Nero in the starring role, who brought his demon arm Devil Bringer as the new centerpiece mechanic. Dante wasn't completely shunned, however; players control him during the adventure's questionably designed back half. In this episode, we'll discuss DMC 4's bizarre 2005 reveal, Capcom's reasoning behind Nero's conception, the fan reaction to the Xbox launch, and what it's really like to visit Fortuna's inspiration, Vatican City. 
Join hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7) and the returning host of The Great Game Debate podcast Wes Bates (@GreatGameDeb8), as we unpack Nero's big debut. 
If you’d like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com.

Gathered after a tragedy befalls our group, I attempt to calm down and plea that we should trust one another. Blood’s been spilled, and tensions are at an all-time high for this lost party of teens trapped in a dangerous land. That’s not quite the scene I had imagined going into Digimon Survive, a tactical RPG by way of a visual novel based on the sometimes-kid-friendly monster franchise. The dramatic dynamics at play are gripping, but the grid-based battles left me snoozing, souring what could have been a compelling, complete package.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Standing here, I realize that this Super Replay will be a cut above the rest because we’ll be slicing and dicing in Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance! Join us today on Twitch at 3 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. 
Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. 
Watch on Twitch!
Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Andrew Reiner and Blake Hester, as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure. If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes. You’ll also be granted entry to the official Game Informer Discord channel, where our welcoming community members, moderators, and staff gather to talk games, entertainment, food, and organize hangouts!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As many of you well know, I rather enjoyed cat adventure Stray recently. As an owner of two tortoiseshells myself, it was right up my alley. I do, however, have a confession to make. When I started seeing other real life cats enjoying the game alongside their respective humans, I began to feel sad and a bit left out. You see, my cats Maple and Midna (still!) haven't shown any interest in Stray whatsoever, not even flicking up their ears in response to the cat's in-game meow. I'm not gonna lie, it kinda broke my heart a little bit.
However, I'm beginning to think their (clear and apparent) hatred of video games goes further than simple disinterest. I was playing A Plague Tale for the first time last week, a game famous for its swarms of screeching rats, and STILL nothing. They love hunting rats and bringing them home to leave as little presents for us on our back door step. Heck, they'll even wig out and go into prowl mode when they hear them scrabbling away underneath our floorboards (yes, we do have a rat problem in our house). But clearly, their ice cold little murder hearts are unmoved by their video game equivalents. Is this what it's like when your children reject your hobbies and go and sulk in their rooms for the rest of the day? Because it sure does feel like it.

The game will make its way to Switch, too, but today's announcement also came with the news that the Switch version will launch at a later date.

It does, however, still apply to Zapling Bygone. Describing it in less mechanical terms could make it sound creepy. You're a spore of an all-consuming hivemind, dropped on an unfamiliar planet to assimilate it. You move by skittering about on wobbly green tentacles, leaping and climbing and clinging and lashing out at living things with them, then absorbing the green muck that bursts out, and periodically consuming a creature powerful enough to be worth assimilating. And wearing its skull in the centre of your tentacle mass, because why not.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Infinity Ward has released a TikTok (it’s a new world) that shows some of its developers discussing a new map in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 called Farm 18, as reported by Eurogamer. 
The map will probably fall into the medium-sized range of Call of Duty maps, and that’s because it’s one part a level set in an abandoned and overgrown cement factory and another part, Shoothouse, the popular level from 2019’s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. Of course, it’s not a 1-to-1 recreation, but Infinity Ward says Farm 18’s center, which is a large shoot house, was inspired by Modern Warfare’s Shoothouse.
Check it out for yourself below: 
Welcome to Farm 18. Location: [classified]. Shoothouse optional. #ModernWarfare2 #IntelDrops pic.twitter.com/OkZuuwjPXD
August 11, 2022
As you can see, the map looks like it’s going to be a great time. Players looking to play it safe can stick to the outside, using the overgrown brush to conceal them while stalking the level’s perimeter. Those looking for a riskier fight can head into the central warehouse, where they’ll find themselves in the Shoothouse-inspired part of Farm 18.

The tweet, embedded below, doesn’t elaborate more than that. We haven't heard much of a peep about the game since its reveal last summer, making us wonder if a delay was on the horizon.
Marco, Eri, Fio, and Tarma are tinkering away to make #MetalSlugTactics as explosive as possible on release, but the squad needs a bit more time in the shop to prepare for the battles ahead. See you in 2023! @LeikirStudio x @Dotemu

Metal Slug Tactics was one of the pleasant surprises of E3 2021. The game, developed by Leikir Studio, transforms the series’ explosive run-and-gun action into a tile-based tactics experience that retains Metal Slug’s signature style and tone. Although turn-based, units still wield classic Metal Slug weapons and can be improved by unlocking abilities and perks on a skill tree.
We’ll have to wait a while longer to see how well Metal Slug translates to this new template. When it does arrive, it will be available on Switch and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nightingale, the Victorian first-person survival action game, has had its early access launch pushed to the first half of 2023. The game is the debut by Inflexion Games, a team consisting of former Bioware developers, including ex-general manager Aaron Flynn. 
In a message posted to Twitter, Inflexion explains it delayed the launch for two reasons. One, it’s migrating the game to Unreal Engine 5. Two, it needs the extra time to ensure it's polished and packed with content before players can begin testing it out. You can read Inflexion's full message below (click the image to enlarge). 
Nightingale debuted during The Game Awards 2021 and is a PvE crafting and survival game that can be played alone or in co-op. Players find themselves stranded in a Victorian Gaslamp fantasy world connected by a network of portals. To survive, they’ll have to harvest materials such as wood and ore to construct weapons, equipment, and buildings. Jumping through portals transports players to new biomes such as deserts, swamps, and jungles. Nightingale’s appearance during this year’s Summer Game Fest introduced Realm Cards used to unlock new areas and influence the type of content, such as enemies and resources, they contain. 
So far, Nightingale is only confirmed to launch for PC via Steam.]]></summary>

Anyway, you can get ten years' worth of AA batteries - 100 in total! - for just £13 at Amazon right now. This normally costs £18, so that's a nice little savings - and of course it's far cheaper per item than buying batteries in smaller packs.

It's capable of transfer speeds up to 1050MB/s, minimising the time it takes to copy files to and from the drive, and offers low enough access times that you can easily run games from it too. It normally costs around £85, but today it's dropped to a historic low price of £77 - a great value for a portable NVMe SSD offering this level of performance.

Co-developers Insomniac Games and Nixxes, who spoke to me this week about the port's development, have also taken the care to festoon this version of the open-world crim-puncher with various Windows-exclusive features. These span enhanced ray traced reflections and ultrawide monitor support to both Nvidia DLSS and (surprisingly, given it wasn’t in the initial PC features trailer) AMD FSR 2.0, adding to a list of visual options that already stretches into the sky like a Manhattan high rise.

As a counterpoint to the episode on the nicest blokes to hang out with in games, we've decided to talk about our most hated NPCs (a bonus prize to anyone who can guess which is the one we all say first). It's an interesting one to discuss, because the line between intentionally annoying and unintentionally annoying can be very thin. Plus everyone tends to find different things annoying. Disclaimer: you are not annoying, any similarities you have to characters we find annoying are coincidental.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer PanicBarn and publisher No More Robots are working on a "comedy open-world RPG" where you save the world with a magic soccer ball. Soccer Story is slated to release later this year for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, PC, and Stadia.
Your role in Soccer Story begins one year after an event called The Calamity, which apparently has made soccer illegal. A magic soccer ball chooses you to be the so-called Savior of Soccer, a role that will also help heal the world.
No More Robots states Soccer Story delivers over 15 hours of gameplay unfolding through story-based missions and side activities. You'll apparently square off against sharks, toddlers, old-age pensioners, and ninjas as you complete these tasks and solve puzzles using the ball.
In addition to the single-player campaign, Soccer Story features a four-player local multiplayer mode, with each team led by an animal captain.
Soccer Story is not developed by SideBar Games, the team behind the wonderful Golf Story title, but it does appear to draw plenty of inspiration from it, including the name.

As you can see, it seems Epic Games will finally unveil the Dragon Ball Z content coming to Fortnite next Tuesday. As for what to expect, that remains officially unknown, but leaks (and, let's be honest, a solid guess) point to skins of popular Dragon Ball Z characters such as Goku and Vegeta and DBZ-specific pickups too. Only time will tell, but fortunately, we don't have to wait too much longer now.

Warner Bros. has given new studio Player First Games some of its most popular characters to carve out space in the Smash Bros.-dominated IP-crossover-fighter genre. MultiVersus succeeds where others have failed, but it still has some growing to do.
Though LeBron James appears on the roster thanks to his starring role in Space Jam: A New Legacy, the WB roster in MultiVersus doesn’t feel as icky as the roster of that film. Each character is treated with reverence, creating a world where you eventu…]]></summary>

Now, it's not a stunner as far as looks go, and it's not got the latest specs either. But what it has got is an expansive 25-inch span, a 2560x1080 resolution and a blistering refresh rate of... 75Hz. OK, so it's far from the best gaming monitor on the planet, but getting an IPS monitor of this size is honestly not bad going - especially as it's been reduced from a UK RRP of £170.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Snow Blind, the next installment in the Mortal Kombat Legends animated film series, got its first trailer today ahead of its October release. The new movie tells the origin story of Kenshi, who tags up with Sub-Zero to kombat Outworld's usual suspects and keep the peace (or as peaceful as this universe can get). 
The film explores how Kenshi loses his eyesight and trains to become the master swordfighter that fans have loved since his debut in Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance. Kenshi’s goal: take down a fully cybernetic Kano and his Black Dragon clan. Kenshi has another ace up his sleeve in the form of a powerful ally (?) in Sub-Zero. Some of the characters that appear include Shang Tsung and Kabal and even lesser seen faces like Tremor and Kira. 


Snow Blind is the third Mortal Kombat Legends film following 2021’s Battle of the Realms and 2020’s Scorpion’s Revenge. It will be available on digital storefronts on October 9 and on Blu-ray October 11. Personally, I'm excited to see where it winds up landing on my ranking of every Mortal Kombat on-screen adaptation.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've played a lot of Spider-Man games. To this day I nurture the belief that all tutorials should be narrated by Bruce Campbell. I even played Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions, which had four different web-dudes and later inspired the Spider-Verse storyline in the comics. Point is, I'm standing on pretty solid ground to judge Spider-Man games. Marvel's Spider-Man, originally released onto Sonyboxes in 2018, is finally coming to PC in a Remastered form, and let me tell you: it is a great Spidey game.

You know Spider-Man. He's a dude named Peter Parker who was bitten by a radioactive spider and can now climb up walls and punch criminals really well. Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered lets you roleplay being Spidey against the backdrop of a big, living New York city. It is, if you'll excuse the pun, amazing. Now, is it the best Spidey game? Nah. I reckon that's its spin-off/sequel Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, but that's not on PC yet. This means Marvel's Spider-Man gets to be the best wall-crawler game on PC for another few months, which isn't a bad consolation prize.

I mean, it worked on a base PS4, right? By my understanding the Steam Deck is basically just a PS4 with a screen slapped on it, so surely portable Spider-Manning wasn't an unrealistic thing to expect?
After spending a few days testing out the game on the Deck I'm thrilled to confirm that Spider-Man Remastered plays great on Valve's handheld with only a few very minor caveats. Hooray! I can finally punch a Vulture in my back garden without getting shouted at by local bird protection services. What a time to be alive.

I loved Animal Crossing: New Horizons back in 2020, but its premise wasn’t enough to keep me engaged over time. Designing my island and keeping all of the villagers on it happy was thoroughly enjoyable, but after a few dozen hours, I craved a new type of gameplay to coincide with what I was doing each day. Cult of the Lamb, a mish-mash of adorably cute animals, critters, and creatures and macabre cult-isms, remedies that issue with an expansive action-combat dungeon system.

Katharine wakes up and immediately sets to work cleaning up the mountains of poop and vomit puddles left over from the previous night's revelries. As she works, she spies her good friend Alice B harvesting cauliflowers from the cult's garden, trying to keep as far as possible away from the (now slightly rotting) corpse of Graham that lays nearby. A cluster of other followers are busy dancing around a shrine in the centre of the village, but they all stop to witness a fight between the two oldest members of the cult - Alice0 and Liam. Ritual combat of the elderly is a staple of CultPaperShotgun, and as Alice0 delivers the final blow to an ailing Liam, cries of euphoria reverberate about the camp as his spirit (and chunks of flesh) are donated to the cause.
Where am I in all this, you ask? I, the Lamb, the glorious leader of our cult, the holy vessel of Death itself, and the sworn enemy of the Bishops of the Old Faith that are destined soon to die by my blade? I'm kicking back at a nearby camp, enjoying a spot of fishing and a friendly game of Knucklebones.
This, friends, is Cult Of The Lamb. And it is excellent.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[They say you shouldn't judge a book by its cover, but when the book in question has been written by Deadly Premonition creator Hidetaka "Swery" Suehiro and is entitled "Dear Ambivalence: The Mustachioed One, The Witches, And The Suspended Body", you can be absolutely sure I'll be adding it to my enormous 'to be read' pile as soon as I've finished typing. First published in Japan last year, Swery took to Twitter yesterday to announce its English translation by Dan Luffey is now available digitally. You might want to sit down for the synopsis, though. It sounds wild.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some of the early trailers for Forspoken, a Squeenix action-adventure/RPG epic coming in January, suggested portentious world-saving stuff. This is a different vibe to a clip shared on Forspoken's offical Twitter this week, which featured main character Frey Holland doing a "Yup, that's me!" kind of elevator pitch for the game. A lot of people on the birdsite took an instant, vehement dislike to Frey's dialogue, and were just as instantly sure who to blame for the peachy keen quiplashing, even if by proxy. Yes, Joss Whedon strikes again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You know when a game instantly charms the socks off you the moment you first clap eyes on it? Point and click puzzler Lost In Play is one of those games for me. Its vibrant cartoon visuals immediately caught my attention when I first sampled its Steam Next Fest demo earlier in the year, and I'm happy to report that the full game, out today, is just as captivating as it was back then. 
It tells the tale of Toto and Gal, a pair of rambunctious siblings who end up far from home after getting lost inside a fantasy world of their own imagining. If they don't find a way back before nightfall, though, they'll be stuck there forever. A classic kids adventure story, in other words, but one that really relishes in its own sense of playfulness. Over the course of their four-odd hour adventure, they'll meet monster fighting frogs in a dark forest, board game-playing seagulls on the high seas, orc mechanics in a vast desert and even a heavy-metal loving sheep on a floating island in the sky as they make their way home  to their messy childhood bedroom. It all makes for some memorable puzzling backdrops, but be warned: if you're planning to play this with little ones, then you'll definitely need a puzzle savvy adult in the mix, as some of its brainteasers aren't quite as child-friendly as you might expect.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We learned in June during the Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase that Persona 5 Royal would be coming to Xbox consoles alongside Persona 4 Golden and Persona 3 Portable. 
With an official Xbox Series X/S version of the game coming out on Oct. 21, and the remastered version set to hit other consoles then too, we’re just a few months away from seeing what the full JRPG looks like running on a new-gen console. Now we have our best look yet, featuring Persona 5 Royal running at 60 FPS on an Xbox Series X, thanks to Faz on YouTube, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. 
Check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see, Persona 5 Royal looks wildly different running at 60 FPS. Personally, and this is shocking for me to say, I think I prefer it running at 30 FPS. I was chatting with a friend about this last night, but the animation of the game and its general art style lend themselves well to 30 FPS. This remastered 60 FPS look almost takes away some of the shine from the game, giving characters and enemies a matte-like finish. Perhaps it will look better in the final release, but right now, I think I will stick to my PlayStation 4 version.

Besides providing a nice look at the moment-to-moment gameplay for those curious about the title, it's fun to listen to Fullerton's takes as both a game maker and a college professor.

        <updated>2022-08-09T18:34:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Embark Studios, a young team of former DICE employees led by ex-EA head Patrick Söderlund, has delayed its upcoming shooter, Arc Raiders. The title was initially slated to arrive this year but will now launch in 2023. 
The reason is that the team has decided to pivot and focus on launching another team-based shooter codenamed Project Discovery. A blog post written by Söderlund explains that Embark has several projects in development and that Discovery progressed so quickly that it seemingly caught up to Arc Raiders, presenting the team with the possibility of shipping two games within the same timeframe. However, doing would've been more than the small team can handle. 
“For a young, relatively small studio like ours, releasing two games in short succession would have strained our teams and resources, many of which are shared between the two projects.” Söderlund explains. 
“As such, we decided to let Project Discovery be our studio’s first game to market, pushing Arc Raiders to a 2023 release. It’s a decision that will also allow us to expand and refine the Arc Raiders experience.”
Outside of being a team-based first-person shooter, little is known about Project Discovery. The concept art posted above hints that it's set in the current day or perhaps the near future. Söderlund promises to reveal more details “very soon.” 
Arc Raiders made its debut during the 2021 Game Awards and will be a free-to-play cooperative shooter where players work together to battle mechanical creatures from space. It will launch for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

The XL version of the Razer Iskur gaming chair is down to £287, nearly half the price it is on Razer's official website and an all-time historic low price. Curiously, it's also nearly £230 cheaper than the regular size version! Katharine reviewed that Iskur previously and rated it highly, so if this size fits you then this is a nice chance to pick it up at a very fair price.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Peter is a guy with his head in the clouds. Literally. Well, sort of. A climate science lecturer at Cambridge University, Peter's great passion in life is cloud research. All he wants to do is study clouds: their different formations, their flight paths, their properties, everything. He finds them so fascinating that they're the subject of his 100-page PhD thesis. It’s a poetic subject and one that matches his temperament as a boyish and awkward researcher. But around him the world is spiralling from the political tensions of the Cold War, and as much as Peter wishes to escape to in the clouds, current events are keeping him firmly tethered to the realities of an impending war. 
It’s this tension that makes South Of The Circle such an engrossing story. With player choices that subtly tug the game’s narrative needle in ways you might not expect, it's clear skies and fair winds for the game’s three-hour journey. But with an abrupt ending after a calculated slow-burn drama, it's a rough landing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To say that Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was successful would be an understatement. The highest-grossing video game film in U.S. history already had a confirmed threequel in the works, but today we found out exactly when we'll see Sonic and friends return to the big screen, and it’ll be chillier than usual.
The official movie Twitter account announced the unofficially titled Sonic the Hedgehog 3 will premiere in theaters on December 20, 2024. This marks a big seasonal shift for the franchise as Sonic 1 and 2 arrived during the first halves of their respective years, with the first movie premiering on Valentine's Day and the second arriving in April.

August 9, 2022
The tweet doesn’t reveal anything else about the film, but if you’ve seen the post-credits scene for Sonic 2, you already have a good inkling of where the series is headed. 
December 2024 is a long way off, but Paramount plans to fill the gap with a live-action series starring Idris Elba’s Knuckles hitting Paramount+ next year. There’s also Sonic Prime, Netflix’s animated series that, while disconnected from the film universe, provides another avenue to enjoy the Blue Blur on the small screen. With the next big video game, Sonic Frontiers, slated to launch this fall, the next few years look pretty bright for Sega's mascot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Join host Wesley LeBlanc as he rides solo today to showcase a quick glimpse of You Suck At Parking, an upcoming racer with a very unique twist. Instead of racing to a finish line, your objective is stop...in the marked parking stop.  
Stopping in a parking spot might sound easy but as you'll soon find out, it's anything but because each track is littered with obstacles such as barriers that immediately destroy your car, magnets aiming to pull you off the track, boosters, jump pads, and more. You must survive through it all in order to reach the coveted parking spot at the end of the road. 
Check it out for yourself in the New Gameplay Today below: 


Enjoy this first look at You Suck At Parking as Wesley briefly introduces you to the world of the game before taking a back seat to let you enjoy some uninterrupted gameplay (that's harder than it looks so when you see me die a bunch of times, no you didn't). You Suck At Parking is slated to launch sometime this year on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Sonic the Hedgehog franchise may have turned 30 years old last year, but the party is still going for some. We already knew additional Sonic-themed costumes were planned for Fall Guys this month, but developer Mediatonic this morning announced the details of the collaboration event with Sega's iconic brand. The event is meant to celebrate over 30 years of Sonic the Hedgehog and includes a new Sonic-themed level and new outfits. 
The new level is called "Bean Hill Zone" and tasks the Fall Guys beans with collecting as many rings as possible to win special rewards. If players earn 200 points, they get a "Bean Hill Zone" nameplate. Earning 400 points yields 200 kudos, 600 points get a Bonus Rings Pattern outfit, 800 points gives 400 kudos, and 1,000 points gives you access to Sonic's iconic sneakers.
Those aren't the only rewards you can snatch up during this event, though. New costumes for Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Super Sonic, and Dr. Robotnik are all available in the store during the event. You can also buy the Sonic Foot Tap emote.
This isn't Sonic's first appearance in Fall Guys as a costume. Back in 2020, players could pick up this Sonic costume. This special Fall Guys event featuring Sonic the Hedgehog begins on Thursday, August 11, and runs until Monday, August 15.
Fall Guys originally launched on PlayStation 4 and PC, where it found overwhelming success as a fun gameshow-style twist on the battle royale genre, in 2020. In 2021, publisher Epic Games acquired Fall Guys developer Mediatonic. Earlier this summer, Fall Guys changed from a premium model to a free-to-play model, and launched on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and Switch.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel’s Midnight Suns, the upcoming card-based strategy RPG by Firaxis, as been hit with its second delay. A Take-Two earnings report revealed that the game had been pushed out of its October 7 date to an unspecified release within the 2023 fiscal year. That means it will now arrive sometime before March 31, 2023.
The game’s Twitter account confirmed the delay with a message, embedded below, that also revealed that the game will now have a staggered release. Midnight Suns will come to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC first within the fiscal year. The PS4, Xbox One, and Switch versions arrive sometime after that. 
Important update from the Midnight Suns team pic.twitter.com/79yVfzpDED
August 8, 2022
While Midnight Suns will only face a five-month setback at most (for current-gen, at least) and could technically still arrive in 2022, seeing it suffer another delay is disappointing nonetheless. The game was first announced almost a year ago at last year’s Gamescom. It graced Game Informer’s cover that month and was first scheduled to launch this March before being delayed to October. A reimagining of the Rise of the Midnight Sons comic event, players control a team of occult heroes like Blade, Magik, and Nico Minoru and Avengers like Iron Man, Captain America, and Spider-Man to battle Lilith, the mother of all demons. Midnight Suns' turn-based combat utilizes a card system for selecting commands, and between battles players explore a headquarters where they can socialize and bond with their teammates. 
We played the first four hours of Marvel’s Midnight Suns in June and wrote up seven takeaways based on our time with it. You can also watch us battle Venom as Spider-Man and other heroes in this episode of New Gameplay Today.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't spend a ton of time testing gaming laptops these days, but one of my recent favourites was the Zephyrus G14. This laptop is slim and compact, yet sports a brilliant 14-inch 2560x1600 120Hz display, a powerful RX 6700S graphics card and a top-end Ryzen 9 6900HS processor. This is backed with a 1TB NVMe SSD and 16GB of DDR5 RAM (!!), an impressive loadout that uses basically the fastest and latest-gen components you can fit into a laptop of this size. 
Today Best Buy in the US are doing a great price on this spec of the Zephyrus G14, charging $1399.99 for it rather than the launch price of $1649.99 - a $250 reduction. That's the best price we've seen for this model and an awesome deal on a compact yet powerful all-AMD laptop.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graphics cards are falling in price rapidly, and nowhere is this more true than on the bleeding-edge end of the market. After seeing discounts on AMD's first 6000-series graphics cards last month, we're now also seeing deep cuts to the more recent 6X50 models - including the subject of this piece, the Radeon RX 6950 XT. This particular card is the very fastest that AMD make, and offers rasterised performance on par with Nvidia's RTX 3090 and 3090 Ti.
Today, it's been discounted to £850 at Scan, a big reduction from its original UK RRP of £1065 earlier this year.

        <updated>2022-08-08T15:45:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon Ball FighterZ is finally getting rollback netcode by way of the newly announced PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions of the game. The update will also be available on PC.
For the unfamiliar, rollback netcode is a system that provides a nearly lag-free online experience, hence why it's always a highly desirable feature in the fighting game community. During EVO 2022, DBFZ producer Tomoko Hiroki shared that the current-gen versions will support rollback netcode, whereas the PS4 and Xbox One editions will not. There's no release window for upgraded ports, but a message from Bandai Namco's Twitter account states we'll learn more information later and that it will take "some time" before the system is finished. 
While that's bad news for those who don't own a PS5 or Xbox Series X/S, Bandai Namco is at least planning some sort of upgrade path for existing game owners on current consoles (such as Smart Delivery on Xbox). There's no mention if the Switch version will receive a rollback netcode.  
Hiroki also announced that Dragon Ball FighterZ is now content-complete, meaning it will not receive any more fighters or balance updates. The game received three DLC fighter packs during its lifetime that added over a dozen characters to its roster. 
Dragon Ball FighterZ first launched in January 2018 and was hailed as one of the best fighting games of the decade and arguably the best Dragon Ball video game period. You can read our review of the launch version of the game here.]]></summary>

Well, I'm proud to announce that my fortunes have since changed and that I've bested it. I should say "we", as my achievement was aided by a co-op pal, and the only person on Earth patient enough to accompany such a terrible Spelunker. We even reached the first boss, and the level after that! Before we both got splatted by an anti-gravity zombie-puppet-that-lives-underwater.
Aside from my – our – achievements, I learned that the game is a perfect measurement of fatigue. Where rulers calculate distance or Ollie's highly scientific WIPERS precipitation system measured the best rain in games, Spelunky 2 is the ultimate tool for accurately determining just how tired someone is.

I've crossed the active warzones of GTA Online and PUBG, stunted down murderous descents in extreme sports games, tried to learn serious bike race tactics in strategy games, gone for a weird ride in a walking simulator, and even needed to ride my real bike for a game powered by Strava. For your convenience and enjoyment, that's now all gathered here with some bonus bike thoughts.

        <updated>2022-08-08T14:47:09.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is it lazy to describe Turbo Golf Racing as ‘Rocket League if the cars were playing golf instead of football?' A bit, yes. But it’s also largely accurate. Up to eight players race across a track, ramming their boost-enabled car into their huge futuristic golf ball to send it flying forwards until (depending on your skill or luck) it flies/rolls/plops anticlimactically into the big hole at the end. It’s golf, sort of, but fast, demanding, and often unpredictable. You don’t even have to wear silly trousers while playing it, but that’s just my personal choice.
Of course, it’s not quite so simple as hitting your ball forward and relying on the videogame gods to deem your ball worthy of reaching the goal before everybody else’s. There are 30 courses of varying length and complexity, and none of them are a simple drag race to the end. There are ramps, twists, turns, and plenty of obstacles. While the very shortest courses are pretty frictionless (I’ve won a few in under 20 seconds), the longest ones are practically begging you to make agonising mistakes.

        <updated>2022-08-08T14:03:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bandai Namco revealed a big update for Tekken 7 during this weekend’s EVO tournament, which may have also teased the next entry in the long-running series.
A trailer running down the Tekken 7 balance update, which arrives on August 17 and introduces balance adjustments and new tactics, concluded on a tantalizing note. A clip of Kazuya’s semi-infamous Tekken 1 arcade ending, in which he drops Heihachi off a cliff before giving a cheesy smile to the camera, transitions to a smirking modern Kazuya with a message of “Get Ready.” The clip begins at the 1:40 mark. 


Fans have excitedly interpreted this footage as a teaser for Tekken 8. That would make sense; Tekken 7 launched on consoles in 2017, so it feels like the right time to begin hinting at the next entry. Perhaps it’s a different Tekken project entirely. Or Bandai Namco simply thought this would be a humorous footnote to wrap up its Tekken 7 news.

        <updated>2022-08-08T13:24:39.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has revealed that it will live stream a Splatoon 3 Direct this week. 
More specifically, it will begin at 6 a.m. PT on Wednesday, Aug. 10, and will feature roughly 30 minutes of updates. Check out the announcement for yourself below:
Tune in on August 10 at 6 a.m. PT for a livestreamed #Splatoon3 Direct presentation. Join us in the Splatlands for roughly 30 minutes of updates! pic.twitter.com/iFfaU3V6vM
August 8, 2022
As you can see, there’s not much else to glean from this news. If you’re the kind of person who anticipates game-focused Directs to reveal information about other anticipated titles, I would say you should not do that with this one. It seems very much a “we’re only going to talk about Splatoon 3” kind of Direct announcement. Of course, I could be wrong, but you know, expectations and all that. 
However, if you’re a Splatoon fan, it sounds like Wednesday will be an excellent day. Not only are you getting new Splatoon 3 details and information, but “roughly 30” minutes of it – that’s a lot! As for what to expect, new weapons, characters, maps, and story details will likely be showcased. This will probably be the last Splatoon 3-focused Direct, too, considering the game hits Switch less than a month after it on Sept. 9. 
While waiting for Wednesday’s Direct, check out this Splatoon 3-themed Switch console and then listen to this new punk rock-inspired track from Splatoon 3’s soundtrack. After that, check out the latest Splatoon 3 gameplay trailer.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/08/08/snk-reveals-a-new-fatal-fury-game-the-first-in-more-than-20-years-is-now-in-development"/>
        <updated>2022-08-08T13:05:38.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SNK revealed during the Evo 2022 fighting game tournament held in Las Vegas that a new Fatal Fury game has been greenlit and is now in development. 
This news comes from a short teaser trailer that showcases a new look at some Fatal Fury art alongside the following message, which plays on screen: “The city of legend still breathes. Hungry wolves back on the prowl. A new destiny hidden in darkness. New Fatal Fury/Garou green-lit.” 
Check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see, SNK didn’t reveal much else, and if you’re a Fatal Fury fan, you probably have many questions. Will this new game adopt a 3D art style like other modern fighting franchises such as Street Fighter 6, or will it stick with traditional 2D art? Which fighters are returning? Will there be new fighters? Only time will tell. 
If you’re unfamiliar with Fatal Fury, you might recognize the name Terry Bogard, who regained some popularity after his inclusion in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. He’s the protagonist of the Fatal Fury fighting game series. If you don’t recognize that name either, nobody can blame you – the last Fatal Fury game came out 23 years ago, with Fatal Fury: Mark of the Wolves’ release in 1999. 
It’s unclear when we’ll hear more about this new Fatal Fury game, but it’s nice to know at least a game is in development for the classic fighting franchise.

Demons Happened is a curious blend of very rapid action faintly reminiscent of Hotline Miami, and an Abe's Oddysee type of puzzle game. Such disparate genres don't often blend as well as this, and I'm disappointed that it hasn't got a bigger reception.

Created in 1996 by Rocket Science Games and published in early 1997, this ambitious 3D-rendered first-person adventure has you journey through 4 surreal, dream-like worlds in search of your lost colleague.
ScummVM currently supports the English and German versions.  It features a widescreen mode, improved cinematic quality, and a few bug fixes. A Japanese version also exists, but we need more information about it to support it. Please contact us if you have a copy of the Japanese version or some other language version that we haven't discovered yet.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. You can also download a demo here.  If you encounter any issues, please submit them to the issue tracker!

You can find all of this goodness available for a number of platforms on our downloads page. If you are using Windows, macOS or the Ubuntu Snap package, the autoupdater will assist you in updating to ScummVM 2.6.0.
As always, thank you for your continuous support — happy adventuring!
