Today though, this monitor crashes into new relevance as it's been discounted to just $200 at LG's US store, an incredible price that makes it almost an impulse buy pickup for anyone that wants to try out the majesty of an ultrawide monitor.

In an era where our abundance of information, freely available and shareable, expands more and more every day, it's increasingly difficult to avoid learning something you might not want to know. These can range from the ending of a show to a character death, or even to a big moment in a classic like Chrono Trigger.


What a spoiler entails can truly run the gamut of all possible, conceivable information about an event or story. And as many spoilers exist in the world, there are also concerns about how much to say, or what truly constitutes a "spoiler." Some are immediately recognizable, while others become so engrained in culture that they are, quite frankly, idiomatic.

Sorry for the random quote, but it feels very applicable to Diablo 4 with the Season 2 Campfire chat that just ended. In the roughly 1 hour and 15-minute stream, the Diablo team highlighted all the big changes coming to the ARPG with the launch of Season 2, Season of Blood.


I have to say, I've been very impressed with what I've seen from this devstream and last weeks. While the previous stream focused on the new content coming with Season 2, today's instead highlighted the bigger core changes coming to Diablo 4 including class changes, quality-of-life updates, and more. I'm not willing to bet the house just yet. But, I will say this: Diablo 4 Season 2 looks promising, and I will be giving it a try. Here is a full…]]></summary>

You may have pocketed a few sets, during your journeys across the Settled Systems. They're not hard to find.

Licensed games are rarely high up on my priorities, and even though I love RoboCop, I never thought anyone would go to the effort of doing the movie justice in a video game.


RoboCop is a lot more than just a license easily transferable to action figures. The 1987 movie was a surprisingly grey look at corporate overreach, gentrification, the role of police, and the nature of humanity, among other things. Those themes, as well as the ultra-violence depicted, make it strange that it would be adapted into a children’s cartoon. It’s so ironic for the license; an irony that was probably missed by the marketing department.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A burning question resting on fans' minds since The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom released is where all the Guardian tech disappeared to after Breath of the Wild's events. Although some time passed between installments, the Guardians' omission feels odd, given their previous prevalence.


Now there's an official answer given by Tears of the Kingdom director Hidemaro Fujibayashi, and it's uneventful. He stated in an interview with Telegraph that the Guardians "disappeared after the Calamity was defeated (sealed)."


"All of the people of Hyrule also witnessed this, but there is no one who knows the mechanism or reason why they disappeared, and it is considered a mystery," said Fujibayashi. "It is believed that since the Calamity disappeared, they also disappeared as their role had been fulfilled."


Fujibayashi then acknowledged how common "mysterious occurrences and phenomena" are to Hyrule's various races. It's why nobody saw this as any cause for concern since odd events are just part of everyday life.




He finishes his in-world explanation by stating how many Hyrule residents accept that "ancient Sheikah technology" was responsible. Many also saw it as something not worth delving into. He concluded by mentioning how both titles' civilizations are completely different, and the team based each title's concepts on the respective civilizations.


On Tears of the Kingdom's design, Fujibayashi said the team aimed to give players an "exhilarating and happy experience" while exploring the Sky Islands. Meanwhile, the Depths were to provide "tension" to players exploring.


The official explanation for the Guardians' disappearance in Zelda being that they just left and nobody cared is honestly hilarious. It'll likely be a while before we see them again as The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom won't have any post-launch content.

Often, this means veering deep into Destiny's most obscure pieces of lore, with expectedly mixed results. One of the latest theories that's been posted on the r/DestinyLore subreddit, however, has more merit than most, and it may well be on the right track, given everything it's got going for it.


Specifically, Level8Vermin recently posted an idea of how one of Lightfall's biggest mysteries might unravel come The Final Shape. Even though players do know by now that 2024's DLC will see Guardians going inside the Traveler in their pursuit of the Witness, it is currently im…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-10-10T16:28:42.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony has finally announced the production of a slimmer PS5 model after years of rumors and speculation. It’s sent to launch “this holiday season,” which, judging from the seasonal stock in most department stores, started sometime in July.


I can’t believe it’s been nearly three years since the launch of the PlayStation 5. For the longest time, it was hard to even get your hands on one. If you were someone who persevered and got a launch model, here’s the inevitable spit in your eye.




It’s not that bad, though. The slimmer PS5 model doesn’t have any more horsepower and is coming fitted with the same size hard drive (1TB). The reveal trailer doesn’t really show off any comparison between the two models, which is because there’s not tremendous difference. It’s described as having reduced “more than 30%, and weight by 18% and 24%.” So, it’s definitely leaner in line with the PS4 or PS3 redesigns. The launch model PS5 was a pretty chonky beast, so I’m sure your shelves will thank you.


It comes in both disc and all-digital versions, though the digital version will now have an option to add an Ultra HD Blu-ray Disc Drive. The vertical stand is sold separately for some reason. 


The slimmer model PS5 will start showing up in stores “this holiday season.” The price remains $499.99 USD for the disc model, and 449.99 USD for the discless one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nearly three years after the initial launch of the PlayStation 5, Sony has revealed a slimmer redesign. Both the disc drive model and the digital model will be updated, but these two models aren't as different as they used to be: you will now be able to purchase a disc drive separately, allowing you to upgrade a digital model to a disc-compatible version. Both versions will be available this November, and will eventually replace the current model of PS5 altogether.
"The new PS5 has been reduced in volume by more than 30%, and weight by 18% and 24% compared to the previous models," the PlayStation blog post reads. It also mentions that the new covers have different textures, which isn't immediately clear from the pictures. "There are four separate cover panels," it says, "with the top portion in a glossy look, while the bottom remains in matte." This does raise questions about the compatibility of console shells Sony currently sells that allow you to change the look of your console, but this question is not addressed in the announcement.
The slim PS5 with a disc drive will still cost $499.99. The PS5 digital edition retails at $449.99, a $50 increase from the original digital edition. 
If you do buy a newer digital version and decide to upgrade it to a disc version, the drive will cost you $79.99 in the US, €119.99 in Europe, £99.99 in the UK, and ¥11,980 in Japan. The total cost of a digital console and a disc drive is a little more expensive than buying a disc drive version outright. The console will include a new horizontal stand to set the console on its side, and a vertical stand will be on sale for $29.99 USD | 29.99 EURO | 24.99 GBP | 3,980 JPY. You can watch the reveal trailer below:

Some of these problems have been around for literal years, to the point where players actively avoid anything to do with them. One of the most (in)famous examples of this is Destiny 2's Attrition activity modifier. After hundreds upon hundreds of hours in the game, it's looking like a bigger issue than most first anticipated. In fact, it's holding back Destiny 2's core gameplay loop.


For those who might not be in the know, Attrition is a special gameplay mutator that comes into play in select activities. When it's active, it massively slows down the Guardians' passive health and shield regeneration as a baseline. To alleviate this, killing enemies will sometimes generate special Light…]]></summary>

Many soldiers died along the way, but all for a good cause. Leaders were assassinated as I worked my way up the Hittite court. Now over 100 turns of Total War: Pharaoh later, I had united the Hittites—united in a conquered sort of way—and it was time to set my eyes south towards Egypt. 


But Egypt has faced its own struggles as well. Several leaders, including Ramesses and Seti, have also been fighting for control of the Nile. Seti reigned supreme, but unfortunately for him, I had already solidified my desire to rule the sands. With the colossal pyramids in the backdrop, my siege of Cairo began.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nighthawk Interactive has announced that they’ll be publishing Pui Pui Molcar Let’s! Molcar Party! in North America and Europe on November 21. It’s set for release on Switch.


Originally published by Bandai Namco in Japan and developed by Groove Box Japan, I’m just learning of this show featuring potato cars now. I had to look it up, but apparently, it’s popular in an internet sort of way, but I’ve never seen it. I would probably have remembered potato cars.




The potato cars are actually rodent-car hybrids, with the “mol” part of the title coming from the Japanese word morumotto, which means Guinea Pig. Pui Pui Molcar Let’s! Molcar Party! is a party game based on the concept, and it looks so weirdly compelling. I think it’s poking the same spot in my brain that Choro Q tends to jab at. Cute rodent cars living in a little playset city? Sign me up.


The art style in Pui Pui Molcar Let’s! Molcar Party! is also really charming, featuring felt-like fur on all the potato cars and a sort of stop-motion jerkiness to their animations. Beyond playing minigames involving dancing or playing cops and robbers, you can also observe/feed the potato cars and even pet them. You can dress them up and take photos of them. It’s a game that looks wholesome and cute while also having a bizarre, unhinged quality.


Pui Pui Molcar Let’s! Molcar Party! is set to release for Switch in North America and Europe on November 21. It’s been out in Japan since late 2021.

I'll admit, I don't have too much experience with VR. But the idea of a Stellaris story with its many species, systems, and space structures sounded like the perfect fit for VR. Ghost Signal: A Stellaris Story steps away from grand strategy and instead puts players in control of a single ship as they traverse systems dealing with threats, acquiring upgrades, and tracking down the Ghost Signal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spooky season is fast approaching, so naturally all the horror games are coming out to play. One of these is Amnesia: The Bunker – the latest Amnesia entry from Frictional Games – which will be getting a new mode this Halloween.


In a recent video uploaded to the developer's YouTube channel, creative lead Fredrik Olsson gives us a taste of what's to come in the next update.




In particular, he shows off what's being called the "Training Grounds," which appears as an option in the main menu. Essentially, this is a way to help you hone your Amnesia skills. This will be particularly interesting for those wanting to play on the harder difficulties.


If only you could take all that ammo with you


This new mode is basically a way of getting better at the game's mechanics. Olsson shows us how you'll be able to practice throwing grenades at exploding barrels, shooting guns, or overcoming obstacles (physical, as opposed to fear-induced).


This goes hand-in-hand with the new shell shocked mode that's coming to Amnesia this month. The update will offer a new difficulty for those who feel like The Bunker could do with having the challenge cranked up a notch.


For instance: time will no longer pause when you enter the in-game menu. So no more catching your breath while you hold the action to gather your thoughts. That monster's coming whether you're busy in the inventory or not.


On top of that, the safety of the admin office will also be a thing of the past. The new "shell shocked" update will change the door from a solid metal to a wooden barricade. Essentially, this means nowhere will be safe from the horror that stalks the titular bunker.


While there isn't an exact release date for the patch yet, Olsson says it should be coming out around the Halloween period, possibly a couple of days before. So look out for that.

        <updated>2023-10-10T15:02:36.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We can't be certain just yet, but it's possible that Nvidia may be working on a Ti version of the RTX 4080 graphics card. If so, it could offer a more powerful piece of kit than the regular 4080 that's currently on the market.


The information comes from known hardware leaker MEGAsizeGPU (as spotted by Videocardz). A recent post on Twitter/X says a new 4080, which could bear the suffix S (as in "SUPER") or Ti, might be in the pipeline.




The post goes on to say that, if true, the card could use the fully enabled AD102 chip, have a TGP below 450W, and be the same price as its RTX 4080 cousin. On top of that, the leaker suggests the GPU may be with us "early 2024."


Temper expectations, for now


Of course, it goes without saying that these are just rumors and speculations. At the time of writing, Nvidia – or any other official party – hasn't confirmed whether this new Ti graphics card is currently in development.


So far, the 4080 and the beastly 4090 are the only (non-laptop) Nvidia graphics cards in the Ada Lovelace range to not have a Ti equivalent yet. No doubt the latter will get one at some point. However, if it's anything like the 3000 series, it could arrive late into this generation.


On top of that, Nvidia had to 'unlaunch' its RTX 4080 12GB card around this time last year. At the time, the tech company cited the name similarities between this product and the already released RTX 4080 as the reason for the cancellation.


If the 4080 Ti does become a reality, it's likely to offer better performance than its predecessor. The fact that we haven't had an Nvidia 4000 launch since July (the 4060 Ti) does suggest we're due one, so Team Green could well be preparing something.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft's xDefiant is in hot water yet once more, according to the developer itself. After it failed to pass certification earlier this year, xDefiant has been indefinitely delayed.


Executive game director Mark Rubin recently took to Twitter to announce that the developers "have identified some things that brought us to the decision to take some extra time to fix or improve the experience for everyone." The xDefiant team identified some key pieces of feedback collected from the game's recent public test beta, and Rubin's post explains that it's going to take a bit to execute it.




Why is xDefiant pushed back again?


Though the situation is certainly less than ideal, and the official announcement is hardly detailed enough to explain what's going on in the background, Rubin's own Twitter post does explain what's what.


"A great example of feedback from the PTS test was around movement feeling off," he said, singling out the slide-to-cover feature in particular. "Nothing had changed in that part of the game but because people brought it up to us we were able to dig deeper and find that the slide was being interrupted by frame spikes."


This, according to Rubin's post, is just one example of several things the team wants to fix. "I know it's a bummer that we are moving the date especially since we seemed so close and that for many the game is great and they can't wait to play but I'd rather ship a game that is better for everyone," he said. "Our intent for this game is to be something that players can return to for many years and to do that we have to build this game WITH the community."


A level-headed take, certainly, but the fact remains that Ubisoft's response to Call of Duty is, once again, out of sight, with the release window being a total unknown. One can only hope that Rubin and his team will be able to leverage all the feedback he outlined in a way that'll make up for many pushbacks of xDefiant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bandai Namco has announced Pac-Man Mega Tunnel Battle: Chomp Champs, a 64-player Pac-Man battle royale. I’ll be copy-pasting that title from now on because there is no chance I’m going to remember that word salad.


With Pac-Man 99 delisted for reasons that only make sense to Nintendo, there’s a gap in the market for a Pac-Man title involving too many people. Despite being a battle royale, Pac-Man Mega Tunnel Battle: Chomp Champs isn’t a complete translation of Pac-Man 99. Instead, you’re not only working to clear your own maze, but you can also travel to the mazes of opponents, eat their food, eat them then leave a mess on the way out. Mazes do get eliminated, but neither the press release nor the trailer really says why. However, they evaporate in a mess of text that is evocative of the classic Pac-Man kill screen.




Actually, none of this explains much about Pac-Man Mega Tunnel Battle: Chomp Champs. A bunch of people, some power-ups, and then a heavy emphasis on personalizing your Pac-Person. I suppose explaining the rules is a bit dry for a trailer, so maybe I’m just asking for too much.


Still, it looks like fun. The vibe I’m getting is similar to Bomberman, which I count as a good thing. I wonder if you get to take control of a ghost if you get put out early.


Pac-Man Mega Tunnel Battle: Chomp Champs is coming to Switch, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and PC in early 2024.

        <updated>2023-10-10T14:34:35.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unity has not been in a lot of indie developer's good books lately. The controversial new fee caused many to turn their back on the development toolkit and its creator. Following on from this, Unity CEO John Riccitiello has now decided to leave the company.


Unity has announced the departure of Riccitiello as President, Chief Executive Officer, Chairman, and a member of the Company’s Board of Directors, "effective immediately." The business executive has been with the company since 2014, having come from Electronic Arts.


As it stands, Unity will be without a permanent CEO for the time being. However, James M. Whitehurst – who has served as Senior Advisor at IBM – will assume the role of Interim Chief Executive Officer. Additionally, the company's Lead Independent Director of the board, Roelof Botha, has been appointed Chairman.


Unreal that he didn't go sooner


Many who've been following the story surrounding Unity's proposed "Runtime Fee" will be able to put the pieces together. While there doesn't appear to be any official statement as to why Riccitiello has resigned, it's too much of a coincidence for the recent debacle to not be a major factor in the decision.


Some will be pleased that the former COO of Electronic Arts is now out of the picture, though the controversy is still around, it seems. As far as we can tell, Unity intends to go ahead with a version of its contentious new pricing plan. The company did backtrack a little bit on the policy, but some may feel it's too little too late.


As such, a lot of people–especially independent developers and studios–probably won't be sad to see Riccitiello leave. However, we don't know who will take over on a more permanent basis, nor whether this will affect the controversial fee that caused a stir among the gaming community.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Move aside, Pac-Man 99.
Pac-Man 99 has only just been laid to rest, but Bandai Namco is back with another stab at the battle royale genre, announcing Pac-Man Mega Tunnel Battle: Chomp Champs for the Nintendo Switch, launching early 2024.
The game is an expanded version of Pac-Man: Mega Tunnel Battle, which was originally released on Google Stadia. Naturally, the game was shut down in conjunction with Stadia's closure at the start of 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft revealed its "fast-paced firefights meets punk rock mosh pits" first-person shooter, Tom Clancy's XDefiant, in 2021. It's a free-to-play shooter that features factions from different Ubisoft properties, like Splinter Cell, Watch Dogs, The Division, and Far Cry. We went hands-on with XDefiant earlier this year and came away impressed with the shooter. Players enjoyed an open beta back in June, and the full game was set to launch in the summer, but now, developer Ubisoft San Francisco has delayed its preseason launch indefinitely. 
The team announced this on Twitter yesterday, revealing that the recent Public Test Session was a success but highlighted some inconsistencies in the game experience it wants to address before the preseason launch. As such, the preseason launch has been delayed to a later unspecified date. 
Here's Ubisoft's full statement on the XDefiant preseason launch delay: 
An update on XDefiant- pic.twitter.com/3orSnspmp6
October 9, 2023
As you can see, Ubisoft doesn't indicate when to expect the Preseason launch to happen, making this an indefinite delay. 
In the meantime, watch Game Informer's XDefiant New Gameplay Today and then read our XDefiant impressions after going hands-on with the game earlier this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes, when I’m winning a Total War battle handily, I like to pick an absolutely haggard group of low-tier hopelesses and spend the rest of the fight zoomed in on them, narrativising their high-stakes struggles in a rich and velvety internal monologue that monopolises my attention so fully that I more or less ignore the rest of the battle. That these are among my absolute favourite Total War moments may say something about the level of satisfaction to be found elsewhere in the series’ strategy sandboxes, at times as robust as ancient oaks, others as stale as ancient wotsits. It may be an admission on both our parts that, for all its simulated complexity, Total War is really for people who’d be just as happy playing with those little elasticated catapults and plastic castles, if we could still sit on the floor without our pelvises crumbling into soup mix.  


Total War: Pharaoh, which I will acknowledge once and once only as being officially stylised PHARAOH, is almost certainly the most systemically interesting and quality-of-life-full a Total War game has been at launch for a very long time. Three Kingdoms has better diplomacy, Warhammer has unequivocally better goblins, but none are as refreshingly cavalier and passionately thorough with the blueprint of what Total War has the potential to be. CA Sofia should be immensely proud of what they’ve done here, but the realities of Total War’s ridiculous release schedule now clearly mean that even a studio as willing and able to innovate so much in such a short time frame are effectively prevented from producing a genuinely exciting strategy game. I’d love to tell you these new plastic castles are more fun than your old ones, but there’s not even any catapults.

Reports say the acquisition deal is expected to close this week and Xbox players are anticipating the addition of Activision Blizzard games to the Game Pass lineup. However, a new tweet by Activision Blizzard makes it sound like the company's games won't hit the subscription service until next year. Plus, Activision Blizzard says it won't be adding the upcoming Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III or the recently released Diablo IV to Game Pass this year.
Here's what Activision Blizzard said in a tweet posted yesterday: 
It’s awesome to see anticipation building for Call of Duty®: Modern Warfare® III. As we continue to work toward regulatory approval of the Microsoft deal, we’ve been getting some questions whether our upcoming and recently launched games will be available via Game Pass.
October 9, 2023
Diablo IV launched back in June and we had a great time with it. You can read about why in Game Informer's Diablo IV review. For more about Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, check out Game Informer's preview here and then read up on the biggest Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III news from last week's Call of Duty Next livestream.

This isn't the only time you'll see the titular hero, as he'll also be coming to Fortnite. Epic Games is both Fortnite and Alan Wake 2's publisher, so it was only a matter of time before the collaboration happened. 




In the trailer, Wake is seen in a black suit as he slides across the floor and blasts away at his enemies. He isn't the only spooky character coming to Fortnite during the Fortnitemares event this month. Michael Myers from Halloween is seen holding a knife, and Jack Skellington from The Nightmare Before Christmas also makes an appearance in the trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Meta may have spent the last couple of years tumbling down a metaverse rabbit hole, but the company is still responsible for creating the best VR hardware around. The Meta Quest 2 was the ideal gaming VR package: powerful and accessible enough to provide easy, convincing immersion, while also staying highly affordable. Nonetheless, Meta’s sudden fixation on creating a legless version of Second Life did have me worried about the future trajectory of its VR hardware. What daft gimmickry would their next headset come festooned with, and what would it mean for the future of the Quest as a gaming device?


With the Meta Quest 3, we have the answer. And the truth is, Meta’s latest headset does have a whiff of Metaverse about it. Dubbed a "mixed reality" device, its raison d’être is to break down the barrier between reality and the virtual world. While mixed reality is an angle I’m not wholly sold on from a gaming perspective, crucially, the features that make it a mixed reality device are useful even if you don’t want to hold a meeting in your office with a bunch of bisected Sims. Moreover, they’re built into a headset that is more powerful, more comfortable, and generally better than the Meta Quest 2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Missing the Playoffs.
While the Nintendo Switch has never had the prominent American Football video game series, it has had some notable efforts in the Indie and retro spaces. Now we can add Wild Card Football to the mix, and it's certainly an ambitious release in comparison to its contemporaries on the system. From Saber Interactive, it follows a similar approach to NBA Playgrounds and its 2K-pubished sequel, albeit this time the studio is flying solo and doesn't have the official NFL license.
What it does have is an NFLPA license, the player's association, and that's a big part of the pitch for Wild Card Football. While teams are fictional, the players — current and former — are very much real, and interestingly the equivalents to NFL teams are named after their quarterbacks. The teams have relatively little in common with the real-world versions, albeit this Bears fan (yes, by all means feel pity for your humble scribe) was surprised that the Justin Fields team had pretty good stats. Hey, not all games have to be realistic. The handful of arenas are also neat, including a hefty stadium, urban locations like Chicago and London, a camping haven in an impressive forest, and a few other fun options. Like the studio's previous sporting output, the approach is fantastical and entertaining.

You can find all of the highlights in our Prime Big Deal Days graphics card deals guide, but I wanted to draw special attention to a couple of Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 and RTX 4060 Ti listings; the most attainable members of the infamously pricey RTX 40 series, now even lighter on the old wallet.

So after diving back into the demo pile myself, I have another recommendation for you: adventuring across the galaxy in roguelikelike spaceship deck-building dungeon-crawler Cobalt Core. If you enjoy Slay The Spire and FTL, do have a look, though I might argue that FTL's follow-up, Into The Breach seems a stronger influence. Ah, play the demo and see for yourself!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a few months since The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom was released, and since then, players have poured hundreds of hours into crafting clever contraptions and exploring every crevice of Hyrule. Despite this, there may still be aspects of the intricate world that most players have yet to discover. 


This became apparent during the Telegraph's interview with franchise producer Eiji Aonuma and video game designer Hidemaro Fujibayashi. Fujibayashi explains that, for example, holding a Cucco up to any suspicious-looking NPC will cause the bird to start fussing, alerting you that you're dealing with a Yiga Clan member in disguise. Never be fooled by the naughty ninjas again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After years of negotiations with various regulatory bodies around the world, it appears that Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard is nearing completion. This, of course, will bring some big changes to the gaming landscape, as Activision Blizzard has several major franchises under its belt, including Call of Duty and Diablo. 




Many people have been eager to know whether the acquisition will result in more Activision Blizzard games landing on Game Pass. On Twitter, the company clarified that it currently has no plans to put Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and Diablo 4 on Game Pass this year. However, once the deal with Microsoft closes, it anticipates that more of its games will show up on the subscription service as soon as next year.

The fate of Call of Duty following Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard


While many players may not particularly care about the economic factors surrounding the development of video games, the Activision Blizzard acquisition is impossible to ignore due to the massive impact it will have. Some players have been concerned about Call of Duty's future following the acquisition. 


Microsoft has clarified that the franchise will not be a console exclusive, at least for the next decade. Xbox players will have an easier time accessing Call of Duty if it does become a Game Pass regular. 


Signs indicate that the battle to finalize the acquisition may be coming to a close. After some criticisms from the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), Microsoft amended the deal, and reports indicate that it could close as soon as October 13.

Mineko’s Night Market finally arrived on the Nintendo Switch last month and while we enjoyed what this cosy game had to offer, it seems there has been quite a number of bugs and glitches encountered by the game's playerbase.
In response to this, the developer Meowza has issued a post on social media - apologising to players if they've had any "negative experience" and mentioning how there are two patches on the way. One will apparently "will be coming shortly" and is a minor fix, and the patch targeting next week will be much larger.

The news comes almost a month after the company announced plans to introduce a controversial install fee for developers, which resulted in an industry-wide backlash.
Riccitiello is stepping down as CEO, president, and a member of the board of directors. In a press release, Unity states that James M.

Whitehurst is a tech veteran who served as president at IBM from 2008 to 2020 and as a senior advisor from 2021 to 2022.

The sequel to the 2000s cult hit has been a long time in the making. Alien Hominid Invasion was announced way back in 2020, while the HD remaster of the original was just revealed earlier this year. The Behemoth has been sharing regular updates and gameplay videos of Invasion over the past year; now fans won't have to wait long to play it themselves, and they'll be able to pick up both titles on the same day on the console of their choice.

This week's physical charts in the UK are in, and despite two major new game releases, nothing has been able to top EA Sports FC 24's place at the top of the video game sales league.
While most players are picking up the title on PS5 — where an impressive 62% of copes have sold this week — the Switch's hold has only slipped slightly to 7% of the sales, compared to last week's 9%. Not bad at all. You'll remember last week that the physical sales for EA Sports FC 24 have dropped by 30% overall, but it's at least remaining steady. That's even with stiff competition from Assassin's Creed Mirage, Ubisoft's return to the traditional Assassin's Creed formula, which has landed in second place this week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The June 2023 reveal of Super Mario Bros. Wonder was met with many excited reactions; the art direction, the music, and the new enemies all looked like fun evolutions of what fans had grown accustomed to in the New Super Mario Bros. series. However, it was the final shot of the trailer that garnered the biggest reaction, as Mario grabbed an odd-looking fruit and turned into a massive elephant version of himself. Elephant Mario, who appears larger than life on our current cover art, quickly became one of the most recognizable elements of Super Mario Bros. Wonder.
Players won't need to wait long to play as Elephant Mario, as it appears in the very first stage, Welcome to the Flower Kingdom. The Elephant Fruit emerges out of a block, and true to the trailer, Mario transforms into this new for…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DLSS is coming to Starfield, but it won't be today. Developer Bethesda has released a bite-sized update for Starfield, bringing an FOV slider and support for Intel Arc GPUs. And that's roughly about it, folks.


The patch is perhaps a prelude to the larger one fans have been clamoring for, which Bethesda has hinted is coming soon. Granted, players have been asking for the FOV slider update in Starfield for around a month. But there are also requests for a brightness slider, along with a myriad of other accessibility options and quality-of-life features that are mysteriously absent from the game. Today's update hints at Bethesda putting a drip feed on the requested changes, leaving many to wonder when the big update is coming.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the nicest possible way, and with the greatest of respect, Remedy's comms director Thomas Puha would like people to stop fixating on frame-rate and resolution and get on with their bloody lives. Or at least, that's my summary of his thoughts following the recent announcement on Xitter that Alan Wake 2 will have a performance mode on PS5 and Xbox Series X, allowing consoleers for whom responsiveness is a priority to eke a higher frame-rate out of a game "built from the beginning as a 30fps experience focusing on visuals and ambiance."
Puha has subsequently been chatting to press about the creation of the mode and Alan Wake 2's visuals at large. In what has become a time-honoured ceremony for any AAA game developer a month or two before release, he took a moment to observe that focussing on frame-rate vs resolution is missing the wood for the trees. (The trees in question do take a toll on Alan Wake 2's performance, but we'll get to that further down the page.)

Choo choo! It's the Switch 2 rumour train, back on the track and calling at Hushed Whispers and Vague Suggestion, with a brief stop to collect several fistfuls of sodium from Expectation Management. The latest rumours come from SoldierDelta on Discord via wcftech and suggest that Nintendo may have two models of its next console planned — with a digital-only version accompanying a standard model that would accept physical media.
The rumour comes from a user who previously posted information on Team Ninja's Rise of the Ronin several months ago, so while a healthy dose of scepticism is undoubtedly called for, this leaker does have some form, at least. The suggestion is that Nintendo is currently eyeing a $400 price point for the digital-only SKU of 'NG' (apparently a developer codename), with the regular model costing $50 more. September 2024 is apparently the launch date being eyed, with a fallback to November if there are any unforeseen production hiccups — again, this is all unconfirmed rumours at this point, though.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My, how this year has gone by so fast! We're already in October which, for you demo lovers, means Steam Next Fest. If you haven't been keeping up, this is your reminder that the event will go live soon, at 10am PT.


The event gives you access to hundreds of demos of upcoming releases from a variety of studios. You can also chat with some of the developers or watch livestreams. It's basically a celebration of everything that makes indie gaming so good.




At the moment, we don't know exactly what'll be featured, but the above video teases what you can expect to find. Did I just hear something about a Grim Reaper dating simulator?


Sounds Steam-y


Anyone who games on PC knows that Steam is no stranger to events, celebrations, and sales. It's part of the reason Valve's service is still many people's go-to. While the Summer Sale is arguably the one that most look forward to, things like Next Fest offer up something in between the more mainstream events.


Steam also turned 20 years old recently, which was celebrated with – you guessed it – a big sale. I still can't believe the studio behind Half-Life would go on to create one of the biggest PC gaming clients out there. Sure, there are great alternatives, such as GOG, Epic Games Store, and Humble Bundle, but Steam is pretty much the OG of this market.


Next Fest goes on until October 16, so you have plenty of time to check out what's available from upcoming developers.

For $299.99, the bundle notably comes with a Steelbook display case, a patch with the Constellation logo, and a watch with its own custom case. However, some fans are now experiencing issues with the watch specifically, just one month after receiving it.


First spotted by The Gamer, a post on Reddit from user Tovrin says their collectible Starfield watch is now "dead". They go on to say that, after leaving it on charge, the item is no longer functional. Upon initially contacting Bethesda support about this, the initial response wasn't quite so helpful. However, after the post went live, a representative for Bethesda reached out regarding the issue.

You are, indeed, being buried alive. The person burying you is your girlfriend, who waves aside your protests that you aren't dead yet, pointing out that this is exactly what a dead person would say if they were trying to avoid being buried. Can't fault the logic.
Click the downward arrow below the animated image of your girlfriend burying you alive and you'll discover a murky fungal blackscreen where cartoon rats periodically try to eat you, unless you click to get rid of them. Below that, there's a kind of Alice in Wonderland-style alcove in which a tousled lady with a rat on her shoulder reassures you that being buried alive ain't so bad. As she points out, "underground is like, the only place to escape capitalism, plus it's nice and cool". Again, I can't fault the logic. Then she offers to play cards with you. The cards in question have rats doodled on them, including a wonderfully festive rodent Joker. There is passing mention of a "rat god".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been more than a hot minute since we've had a Silent Hill game. Last year's announcement that the series was making a return caused joy (and a bit of relief) in many fans' hearts. As well as brand-new interactive series, we're also getting a remake of Silent Hill 2, and some updates on Steam suggest we may hear more about this project soon.


If you head over to SteamDB – a third-party website that chronicles all things related to the Steam client – you can see that Silent Hill 2 has been quietly (dare I say...silently?) updated recently.




On October 6, Brazilian and Ukrainian subtitles were added, while Portuguese language support was removed, for whatever reason. Perhaps the most interesting thing to note, however, is the change ID above that says Steam achievements have now been added.


What does this mean in terms of a release date?


Naturally, many people (myself included) may conclude that news about the remake is imminent. Obviously, there's nothing officially saying this, but these recent updates suggest we might hear something soon.


We still have no idea when Silent Hill 2 will release, though a website did leak a potential date a few months back. Of course, the listed date was "September 29, 2023," which obviously did not pan out. Still, it's interesting to see activity on the Steam page only a week and a half after that date.




On top of that, it was recently revealed that Silent Hill: Ascension would begin on October 31. Ascension is the interactive SH experience that viewers can influence in real-time. We know few details about this one, so we'll learn more when it launches on Halloween night.


Will this (and the upcoming other entries) be the almighty comeback for Silent Hill many of us are hoping for? Only time will tell.

Now, we're in a post-Oculus world with the Meta Quest 3. Time to check in and see how much consumer-grade VR has progressed in the past three years. Spoiler: it's come quite far!

Product: Meta Quest 3
Manufacturer: Meta
Input: One USB-C charger
MSRP: $499 (128GB), $649 (512GB)


The first thing you'll notice about the Meta Quest 3 is the price tag. Previously, the Oculus Quest 2 was sold at $299 for 64GB and $399 for 256GB. Now we're up to $499 as a base price for 128GB, and $649 for a whopping 512GB. The doubling of storage space for the regular and premium models makes sense, as the ever-encroaching file sizes of VR games hav…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For any frustrations and confusion related to Meta (formerly Facebook) and whatever the Metaverse is, one consistent and more straightforward element of the company’s VR push is that from the beginning, its hardware has been pretty solid. The headsets have not been without their growing pains, but the path from Rift to Quest has been generally smooth, and the iterations have always added worthy improvements. Meta Quest 3 continues along that path to deliver what is, by a large margin, my favorite VR headset, but it doesn’t fix all the problems the medium continues to face.
Comfortability And Visuals
Wearing Meta Quest 3 is reasonably comfortable. The straps are easy to adjust and allow you to make the headset surprisingly tight against your face. This is good for blocking out light and mov…]]></summary>

There are less than two weeks to go until we finally get our hands on the first original 2D Mario adventure in 11 years. It's an exciting time, especially for those who weren't fully sold on the presentation style of the New Super Mario Bros. series when it launched on DS way back in 2006. Super Mario Bros. Wonder, as you'll have no doubt gathered from our earlier hands-on impressions and videos, strikes out from the somewhat...well...overfamiliar gameplay mechanics of New Super Mario Bros. U and its Deluxe Switch revamp, in favour of a fantastical mashing together of lots of all-new ingredients.
This game feels much more in line with the breathless invention of Super Mario Galaxy or Odyssey; full of big ideas, bold art direction and, from our time spent with it so far, we're fairly confident that 20th October will see the launch of one of the very best 2D Mario games we've ever played. Mamma Mia, indeed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“Baldur’s Gate II set the model, and I obviously loved that model,” says James Ohlen. “But there were a ton of people at BioWare who didn’t like it.” During leadership meetings over the course of the Canadian designer’s 22 years at the RPG studio, he’d sometimes feel totally outnumbered when talking about the importance of story. “Game developers don’t get into the industry to create stories, they get into the industry to create games,” he says. “And so there’s this conflict between game developers and story - my entire career it's been a constant fight.”


Ohlen picked his side early. He was telling BioWare stories even before he joined the company. The meeting of Minsc and Boo, one of the most enduring partnerships in PC gaming, came about in a tabletop Dungeons & Dragons game he ran as a teenager. Then a comic book store manager, he took advantage of his premises to guide no fewer than three concurrent D&D groups through their campaigns. “I didn’t really have much of a life outside of Dungeons & Dragons,” he says.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a side mission in Cyberpunk 2077 that involves abducting a notorious union-breaker. One wonders if any of the people who worked on that have joined the union founded by CD Projekt RED employees this month. The union is part of the larger Polish worker's organisation OZZ Inicjatywa Pracownicza, and comes in response to CD Projekt's firing around 100 employees in July due to "overstaffing". Its membership is anonymous and open to people in the industry who aren't employed by the Witcher and Cyberpunk studio, but are thinking about forming a union in their own workplace.


"We started talking about unionizing after the 2023 wave of layoffs when 9% of Reds (that is roughly 100 people) were let go," reads an official FAQ from the group. "This event created a tremendous amount of stress and insecurity, affecting our mental health and leading to the creation of this union in response. Having a union means having more security, transparency, better protection, and a stronger voice in times of crisis."

Legendary game designer Masahiro Sakurai has teased an upcoming "special crossover" with an apparently well-known YouTube channel.
In a post on Twitter, Sakurai confirmed that he will soon be playing "other" games via the planned collaboration (thanks, VGC), though details are scarce at the time of writing. Presumably, the word "other" probably means titles that Sakurai has not personally worked on during his career, though this is merely speculation on our part.

The rumour goes that Iwata created a compression code that significantly decreased the size of the games, thus allowing Game Freak to include the original Kanto region in addition to the newly introduced Johto.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atari and Cristales developer Dreams Uncorporated have pulled back the veil on Lunar Lander Beyond for this week’s Steam Next Fest. They’ve put out a trailer for the game, as well as a demo for you to try it out.


Based on the 1979 vector arcade title, Lunar Lander, Lunar Lander Beyond is a reimagining that ties a narrative and progression to the formula. Atari previously played it coy with a cinematic trailer that left a lot of questions. Especially considering the trailer’s more melancholy tone versus the synopsis, which boiled down to space deliveries.




I personally love the original Lunar Lander, but I was wondering how Dreams Uncorporated was going to tackle it. There have been a lot of adaptations of the game’s fight against gravity gameplay in the decades since its release. I didn’t expect stress.


The press release says, “Beware of mounting stress levels, as they may usher in harrowing hallucinations and the onset of cosmic-induced madness!”


Yeah, I usually start hallucinating when I’ve got a deadline coming up, or I’m visiting with relatives.


It honestly doesn’t look that bad, but, like I said, I'm a fan of the original. You select your pilot, there are four different ships that you can customize, and there are 30 missions across five celestial bodies. From that trailer, it looks like there will be a decent amount of variety between the mission types.


The demo can be test-driven from 10:00 AM today, October 9th, through October 16th. I think that’s in Eastern Time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You can circle December 7 on your calendar, as that's when The Game Awards will be held. This is the tenth annual show, and it'll take place in the Peacock Theatre, Los Angeles, at 04:30 PM PT. You'll have several options when it comes to how you want to watch the show, as it'll be streamed on several platforms including Twitter, Twitch, and YouTube. 




There are plenty of game awards ceremonies around, but few are as viewed as The Game Awards. Last year, the show earned itself a record-setting 103 million global livestreams. The nominees are selected by a jury consisting of over a hundred media publications and influencers around the world, and winners are decided by a combination of jury and fan votes. 


You'll have to wait a little longer to discover which games have been nominated and for further information regarding ticket sales. With as many massive releases as there have been this year, competition is sure to be tight in all categories. 


In 2022, Elden Ring won four awards, including Game of the Year while Stray nabbed two awards, including Best Indie Debut Game. God of War Ragnarok had 11 nominations, the most of any game, and it had 6 wins, including Best Narrative, Best Score and Music, and Best Performance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Redfall was a disappointment upon release, thanks to its open world which felt - as Ed wrote in his Redfall review - like "playing through an already abandoned live service."

Yet though its sparsely populated world made it feel that way, Arkane haven't abandoned Redfall. Yesterday they released its second major patch with a spate of fixes and attempted improvements.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The kart racing genre is known for many mediocre franchise tie-in titles. NASCAR, DreamWorks, and even Garfield have entered the party with varying results. Sonic and Crash are arguably the only two that can somewhat rival Mario and his friends. Disney Speedstorm is on the cusp of that. 


Disney Speedstorm hits and adds some new mechanics and twists to the genre. While the overall game is impressive, it will be hard for many to ignore the microtransactions that poison the sweet apple that's this game (expect many Disney references, you have been warned). 


Disney Speedstorm (PC, PS5 [Reviewed], PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Switch [Reviewed], iOS, Android)
Developer: Gameloft
Publisher: Gameloft
Released: September 28, 2023
MSRP: Free to play

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It might be an unpopular opinion, but I normally despise this trend of VRMMO/isekai-adjacent anime. There are only so many times I can watch the same story about a “regular guy” who dies in his sleep and wakes up reborn as an overpowered character in an MMORPG or a dating sim or what-have-you. And I promise — I’m not being unfair here, they’re all the same story, and I’m tired of pretending they’re not.


But this season brings us a fresh helping of new takes on a tired trope. If you think the genre is lacking when it comes to accurate gamer representation, there’s Shangri-La Frontier. If you like thinking about death and feeling sad, there’s Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End. And if you like lo-fi let’s plays to study/relax to, there’s A Playthrough of a Certain Dude’s VRMMO Life.

With Assassin's Creed Mirage on our minds, which is an overt throwback to the classic Assassin's Creed formula, we decided to take a look back at the first game in the blockbuster series. Some elements of the game hold up and others don't, but in any case, it's a fascinating historical look in multiple ways.
You can find our previous episode of Replay where we played Assassin's Creed right here.

What could we say, how could we act, or who could we woo to bag the ultimate prize? Everyman Trevor Hills - with his office getup, dad-sized ‘tache, and lanky build - isn’t quite so lucky in the upcoming American Arcadia. You see, he’s unknowingly stuck in a reality TV show where the penalty for unpopularity is death, and considering he has the personality of a pencil, his only option is to escape in genre-bending fashion.

Though the four distinct New Super Mario Bros. games were well-received and extremely successful, the developers wanted to deliver something fresh to fans of the 2D series.
"The New Super Mario Bros. series has been going on for a while since the release of New Super Mario Bros. on Nintendo DS, so we wanted to create an all-new 2D Mario experience," Super Mario Bros. Wonder director Shiro Mouri says. "That's how this project started."

Ahead of its launch in May, Xbox revealed that Redfall would only launch with a 30 FPS Quality Mode on Xbox Series X/S, noting that a Performance Mode would arrive at a later unspecified date. Nearly six months later, that date has arrived: Performance Mode is now live in Redfall. 
Publisher Bethesda's patch notes about today's Redfall update don't specify how exactly this Performance Mode works, but presumably, it runs the game at 60 FPS. This update also brings some heavily requested features to Arkane as well, including stealth takedowns, more accessibility options, multiplayer communication improvements,…]]></summary>

That allows HP to hit a more aggressive price target, making the Cloud Orbit S one of the most affordable ways to try a great planar magnetic gaming headset. 
The Cloud Orbit S debuted at a mighty £299.99, but today it's available on Amazon for just £209 - a nice £91 savings.

        <updated>2023-10-06T16:31:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft's long journey to acquire gaming giant Activision Blizzard is finally nearing an end. According to The Verge, a source familiar with Microsoft's plans indicated that it was aiming for Friday, October 13, as a date to close the deal. Ignoring the infamy of the date (it seems Microsoft and Activision Blizzard executives aren't very superstitious), it's not a surprising day to choose. Back in July, the two parties in the deal jointly agreed to extend the deadline of their agreement to October 18 in order to sort out any further regulatory concerns. At the time of publishing, that date is only twelve days away, so the deal would have to be closed soon.
Still, the Microsoft legal department will have to deal with a few more legal challenges before they're completely out of the woods. After restructuring the terms of the merger to grant Ubisoft the rights to stream Activision Blizzard games in the UK, the Competition and Markets Authority granted the deal a preliminary approval, but the regulator still has to make a final assessment sometime before October 18. Still, Microsoft and Activision Blizzard each took this as a major win.
We are encouraged by this positive development in the CMA’s review process. We presented solutions that we believe fully address the CMA’s remaining concerns related to cloud game streaming, and we will continue to work toward earning approval to close prior to the October 18…
September 22, 2023
This news followed the companies' victory over the Federal Trade Commission back in July. At this point, it seems fairly likely that the deal will go through, ending a saga that began almost two years ago. After documents from the hearings leaked and revealed Microsoft's hybrid console, a new Xbox model, and plans to acquire other companies like Sega and Bungie, Microsoft is probably ready to leave the entire matter behind it.

        <updated>2023-10-06T16:30:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Correction: In 2022 the Axis series switched from titling its games for their current year to titling them for next year. Since I skipped last year's installment, and searches for "Axis Football 2022" brought up nothing, I got horribly confused and wrongly stated that the series skipped 2022 entirely. I apologise for this embarrassing error, and for not realising it until the exact moment everyone at RPS went home for the weekend. Although that latter part is at least quite funny.
Axis Football 2024 is part of the little Americaball series that could. Since 2019 I've settled into a habit of skipping every second entry, only to learn that this time, its developers did too.
The result is still iterative improvement, but a more noticeable one in lots of small ways. Its animations in particular combine more naturally, with players visibly struggling to tackle, catch, or shake off an opponent. It feels like a punchier sport, making the significance of blocking and positioning clearer, and bringing out the drama that its coaching mode in particular really thrives on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The RTX 4060 Ti has emerged as something of a sweet spot in Nvidia's current-gen graphics card lineup, being more affordable than the RTX 4070 and above while providing better performance per pound than the 4060 below it - despite some reservations over its 8GB VRAM capacity and relatively modest gen-on-gen performance uplift compared to the RTX 3060 Ti. However, if you want access to Nvidia's DLSS 3 frame generation and 3.5 ray reconstruction features, and one of the most power-efficient cards on the market, then the 4060 Ti is definitely worth a look. 
The RTX 4060 Ti normally retails for $400 or higher, but today you can pick up the Zotac Twin Edge OC model for just $370, a sweet $60 savings versus MSRP on one of the best-looking and highest-clocked 4060 Ti models.

If you’ve followed CCP, you may get a sense of de ja vu. This isn’t the first time the developers have tried to make a shooter happen in EVE Online: it’s the fourth. It’s just they've only gotten one out the door before.

My enthusiasm for Silent Hill these days is approximately that of a dog returning to his vomit (or better, a depressive male protagonist with repressed memories that keep reeling him back to the same, misty high street). There have been so many middling sequels and spin-offs. But somehow, I can't let go. And Ascension does sound quite intriguing, not least for being a crowd-sourced storytelling enterprise akin to a massively multiplayer Until Dawn.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Diablo 4 has been on the back-burner amid the chaos of Baldur's Gate 3 and Starfield's launches, but much like an arch-demonness putting together the pieces of an inter-planar conspiracy, Blizzard have been doing a lot of work behind the scenes. The action-RPG's next big round of additions, the Season of Blood, launches on 17th October alongside the Steam edition of the game. It introduces a new season journey and questline, a new season event, and some skulking new enemies of the Nosferatu persuasion.


The new quest sounds quite fun from the promotional materials. It sees you investigating a mysterious outbreak of punctured necks, recruiting a local Van Helsing named Erys, and tracking down a Dark Master, while harnessing 22 juicy new vampiric powers care of some pact armour.  The latter range from turning into a cloud of bats, through cursing people, to treating yourself to a spontaneous bloodbath so as to enhance your channeled skills, The trade-off is that you'll have to acquire yet another Diablo 4 resource, potent blood, to perform these tricks.

The Pale Reach is Dredge's first DLC, and it launches in just over a month. For more on The Pale Reach, check out the reveal trailer below.


Set in icy waters, the DLC will include "1-3 hours of content" and is accessible at any point during a playthrough of the game. In addition to a new side story, the expansion will add 11 more fish and crab species to the world of Dredge, allow you to craft a ship add-on to break through small icebergs in the water, and add ice blocks to extend the shelf-life of some of your catches. The trailer also features new monsters, like a massive icy crab and a four-legged narwhal-like creature. The Pale Reach will be available to purchase on November 16, and Dredge is available on all major platforms. 
For more Dredge, check out this episode of the GI show. Then, read about how the game's publisher, Team17, announced a wave of layoffs this week along with the departure of its CEO Michael Pattison.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Cyberpunk franchise has been on a winning streak lately. From the acclaimed anime Cyberpunk: Edgerunners to the 2.0 update of 2077 and the release of Phantom Liberty, public perception of the series has largely turned around. Today, CD Projekt Red announced that they're taking the next step with the franchise – creating a live-action production.
The game studio is partnering with Anonymous Content, a media company known for its work on shows like Mr. Robot and films like The Revenant. The project will be produced by Garrett Kemble, David Levine, Ryan Schwartz, Bard Dorros, and Charlie Scully, who will develop the project "in close collaboration with the Cyberpunk 2077 creative team." That said, this is still in the earliest stages; there's still no screenwriter attached to the project.
There are still many questions in the air about the project. They've yet to announce (and perhaps, decide) whether it will be a film or a series. And while the project is "set in the world" of Cyberpunk 2077, there are a lot of approaches they could take. No actors have been attached to the project either, so whether Keanu Reeves or Idris Elba will show up is still up in the air. You can read the full press release here.
For more Cyberpunk, here's what we thought of the latest expansion, Phantom Liberty, and here's a list of tips and tricks to help you get started. After that, check out this feature to learn about lessons CD Projekt Red learned from the launch of Cyberpunk 2077.]]></summary>

More specifically, we look at the post-launch changes the devs are making in an effort to improve matchmaking and wait times. Specifically, we use this to think about games that have changed their reputations after a rocky start, what with Cyberpunk 2077's recent 2.0 update. What are the circumstances that allow games to do that? Why are they such outliers? How do we think about reviews in the context of something like No Man's Sky?
We've also been playing some big recent games, so tune in for discussions of Assassin's Creed Mirage, a call for pirate games, and a hilarious misunderstanding about Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor.

They'll grow in power the whole time, but you'll slow them by stealing and sabotaging with your team of colourful secret agents, who'll bash through gauntlets of mooks and monsters with munitions, magic, and mkicks to the stomach, mostly two action points at a time. All that makes for a colourful ride, and its 1930s setting and adventurous tone carried it for a while, but the more I played it, the more my wavering opinion turned into outright resentment. That's a damn shame, because it gets a lot right.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin’s Creed Mirage is, so says the Alice B review, "the most enjoyable Assassin’s Creed game for years." That’s thanks in part to a returning focus on classic AC stealthing in a single, densely detailed city, and this back-to-basics approach extends to the technical side too. Mirage cares not for being the glossy poster child of ray-traced glamour; it’s just a game that looks pretty nice and runs well on PC, older hardware and Steam Decks included.
It also keeps its list of graphics settings relatively brief, though there are a few in there that can dish out some extra frames per second at little cost to the visuals. Here it is, then: your complete guide to Assassin’s Creed Mirage’s PC performance, from its refreshingly reasonable system requirements to its best settings combinations.

No, the next Pokémon live-action project will be a drama about a woman trying to find adventure in her life through playing Pokémon, rather than it being set in the Pokémon universe.

Woah there, Dr Grant - what the hell are you talking about? Why, the just-announced Dinolords, of course - a blend of strategy and action-RPG from Northplay and Ghost Ship Publishing, in which you raise troops and build castles to fend off armies of T-Rex-riding Danes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year, Atari announced that it acquired Berzerk, its sequel Frenzy, and 10 more classic arcade properties. Now, as part of Atari's Recharged lineup, it has revealed Berzerk: Recharged, and its coming to consoles and PC later this year. 
The original Berzerk is an arcade game released in 1980. In it, players controlled a top-down avatar while shooting through hordes of armed robots in an electrified maze. The big bad was Evil Otto, who bounced around the maze as a giant smiley face, hunting players down. Atari says Otto is back in Berzerk: Recharged, "bringing with him updated graphics, deft twin-stick controls, and a new soundtrack by the acclaimed Megan McDuffee."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo has teased a collaboration between its Animal Crossing series and Lego. It did so today with a short teaser trailer showing Lego-fied versions of fan-favorite Animal Crossing characters like Isabelle and Tom Nook. However, the teaser doesn't reveal exactly what to expect in terms of Lego sets or when we might see this collaboration hit store shelves.
The tweet accompanying the teaser says, "Welcome to...LEGO Animal Crossing!" The video itself shows Isabelle and Tom Nook looking up at the Lego Animal Crossing sky before pulling out to show even more Animal Crossing characters. All of them are watching a gift rise into the sky by way of a balloon, in classic Animal Crossing fashion; somebody get them a slingshot or two. 
Check out the Animal Crossing Lego teaser trailer for yourself below:

This Animal Crossing collaboration with Lego isn't the first time Nintendo and Lego have worked together on Lego sets. The two have been steadily releasing different Super Mario sets for a few years now, with four Donkey Kong Lego sets releasing back in August. Even outside of Nintendo, Lego is no stranger to taking video game characters and turning them into Legos. It's been doing that with Sonic the Hedgehog Lego sets for a while now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rockstar Games revealed that it was bringing Red Dead Redemption and its Undead Nightmare DLC to PlayStation 4 and Switch back in August. It did so, and while the game looked great on both consoles, it was only playable at 30 FPS. PlayStation 5 owners were left wondering if Rockstar wasn't tapping into the power of the current-gen console to bring 60 FPS to the 13-year-old game. 
Now, weeks later, Rockstar has updated the PS4 port of Red Dead Redemption and the included Undead Nightmare DLC to include 60 FPS support on PS5 via backward compatibility. It did so randomly, with a quick tweet announcing the news. 
Red Dead Redemption, including Undead Nightmare, now supports up to 60 FPS on PlayStation 5 via backward compatibility. pic.twitter.com/XMLIe6gYo4
October 4, 2023
Elsewhere in the same update, Rockstar added an option to enable subtitles upon first booting the game. The update also includes general bug fixes and improvements, although Rockstar didn't list which. 
If you bought Red Dead Redemption on PS4 recently to play on PS5, or were looking for a reason to do so, this new update that adds a 60 FPS option might be the reason you were looking for. Now, Rockstar please bring 60 FPS to Red Dead Redemption II on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. And bring 60 FPS in Red Dead Redemption to Xbox Series X/S, too. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Red Dead Redemption review and then read our column on remembering the mundane greatness of John Marston. After that, read Game Informer's ranking of every single Rockstar game.

We've known for a while that the game would use Denuvo, together with the VMProtect software, but what's baking the noodles of many players is that the Denuvo functionality has been snuck in after the Assassin's Creed: Mirage review embargo, denying critics the chance to assess its impact on the game.

Alas, there's no word on a release date for the Steam edition's Adventure Mode beyond "not this year".

After several trailers, gameplay videos, and even a Game Informer cover (check out our hub here for exclusive behind-the-scenes content and more), the game is finally out for everyone. 
If you've kept up with Mirage, you know it's a bit of a return to the series' roots. After completing the game, it's safe to say that's definitely the case, with Mirage falling somewhere between where this franchise began and the modern RPGs of late. It feels modern but ditches the RPG mechanics and nature of the open-world games and instead embraces series tradition: a singular city to explore, a focus on stealth and parkour, one-hit assassinations, and more.

First released in 2021, New World has had players clamoring for rideable critters ever since, and although the privilege of straddling a horse, lion, or other mount, available only…

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another Crab’s Treasure hooked me with its underwater Soulslike premise and cutesy charm. But once you take a closer look at the game’s polluted ocean, filled with plastic shells and weapons, the comparisons to Dark Souls get a little clearer. This is a quiet and kinda melancholy post-apocalypse. We can now find out whether the crustaceans lean on cuteness or sadness more in the game’s new demo, released just yesterday.

The previous Detective Pikachu game, released over five years ago on 3DS, traded in traditional Pokémon elements for mysteries more familiar to the Phoenix Wright/Professor Layton crowd. Gone were the trainers, Poké Balls, and battles in exchange for evidence-gathering, deduction, and a Pikachu that can speak far more than its own name. A year later, the movie adaptation became the second highest-grossing video game film at the time. While the game left a central loose thread dangling, the movie, which is disconnected from the game series, tied everything up in a neat bow.…]]></summary>

As one of the most popular and influential series in video games, Super Mario Bros. must appeal to a wide audience of players across a massive spectrum of skills. The main stages of nearly every Super Mario Bros. game accomplish this daunting feat through balanced level design, innovative gimmicks, and fun challenges that nearly anyone can complete. However, late-game and special stages have traditionally been the place where Nintendo tests the mettle and skill of more veteran players.
Areas like Special Zone in Super Mario World and stages like Champion's Road in Super Mario 3D World are just a couple of examples of Nintendo flex…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Brian Jacques' Redwall books were my greatest obsession between the ages of approximately eight and 12-years-old. They're sort of The Lord of the Rings, but with talking woodlands animals, and their appeal for me consisted of three things 1) comedy British accents, 2) big fights, and 3) big feasts. I couldn't get enough, to the point that I tried to have one of my unborn siblings named after a badger warcry from the novel Salamandastron.
Fast-forward to 2023, and Oregon-based Soma Games are about to release a Redwall videogame, titled The Lost Legends of Redwall: The Scout Anthology. Will it measure up to my childhood fantasies about acorn pancakes slathered with gorseflower honey, or forest logboat armadas of squabbling guerilla shrews? Probably not, but what can? Here's a new trailer from publisher Forthright Entertainment.

We knew the game was coming late this year, but now it's official: The Last Faith hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on November 15. 
Kumi Souls Games announced this release date with a new gameplay trailer that you can watch below: 


If you don't want to wait until November 15 to jump into The Last Faith, you can check it out early with a new extended demo that's available right now on Steam. Kumi Souls Games says that in it, you can get a taste of Mythringal's brutal environment. 
"Often brutal, but always empowering, The Last Faith thrives on merciless and precise combat, with a huge range of custom executions to perform," a press release reads. "Players will unearth a formidable variety of melee weapons, arcane spells, and long-range firearms, allowing them to carve a path in their own style.
"Explore rich, gothic environments in order to piece together the fractured history of Mythringal, and survive intense encounters against swathes of blood-thirsty enemies who will stop at nothing to put an end to Eryk."
The Last Faith hits PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on November 15.

I'm not sure The Fabulous Fear Machine - devised by Fictiorama Studios in partnership with AMC and Shudder - is quite that horrifying, but it's certainly chewing on my nerve endings in an engrossing way. 


It's a top-down management sim, which might not sound very scary, but just look at those colours - irradiated and unwholesome shades of purple and yellow, spreading over chunky, HyperCard continents emblazoned with pulp comic fonts. The visuals wear away at you like the stink of hydrochloric acid. And then there's that red-eyed, turbaned figure, gazing at you in top left. This is the face of the Fabulous Fear Machine. Its offer: to enable your character's world-toppling ambitions. Its price: that your story will become part of its story. The game is out today, and I've got some thoughts ahead of a possible review.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What exactly is The Alters? It's a question I've been itching to get answers to ever since Frostpunk and This War Of Mine developers 11 bit Studios first announced their strange new game at notE3 last year. Until now, all we've had to go on is a cryptic CG announcement trailer that showed a gaggle of identical clone-looking men in bright pink medical gowns, all of whom seemingly live inside a giant wheel full of shipping containers. It didn't really tell us anything about what the game actually is, or how it plays, and we've heard precious little about it since. 
Happily, I've now seen about an hour of The Alters in action at this year's Gamescom, and first impressions are very promising. This is indeed a game about sort-of clones living in a big wheely shipping container, but these containers are actually modules you'll be building in XCOM/Fallout Shelter-style chunks to advance the capabilities of your big wheel base as you work to escape the broiling heatdeath that's slowly enveloping the planet. You'll also be venturing out onto the planet's surface to gather resources, all while managing your crew of clo- sorry, alternate selves - as you assign their daily work tasks, and then there's the fact that, well, you're all chuffing different versions of the same person and the literal embodiment of what your life might have been like if you'd done X instead of Y, or Y instead of Z. It's a fascinating blend of ideas, and if 11 bit can stick the landing, I reckon it could end up being something really quite special. Here's everything I learned.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[11 Bit Studios, the developer behind This War of Mine, Frostpunk, and Children of Morta, unveiled The Alters last year. It called it a sci-fi adventure where one man is trying to survive, and hopefully get home, after a space mission goes wrong. To do so, he must rely on both himself and various copies of himself. 
Today, 11 Bit Studios released a new trailer of The Alters that gives us our first look at its gameplay, which highlights that it's a third-person, base-building survival game. The team says the story is "driven by life-defining choices and exploring the diverse paths one could take" after Jan crash-lands on an inhospitable planet turning toward a massive sun. 
Check it out for yourself in The Alters gameplay trailer below: 


"In this desperate race against time, Jan must harness local Rapidium crystals to create his many versions: the 'Alters'," a press release reads. "Set within an ever-moving mobile base, both teamwork and building a wide range of expertise are indispensable for survival. By selecting diverging paths for other Jans during the alteration process, they acquire distinct skill sets. They become invaluable, not only for maintaining the base, but also for tasks like cooking, crafting tools for surface exploration, and gathering essential resources." 
11 Bit Studios says the Alters are more than mere resources, though, as they are sentient beings with their own emotions, problems, goals, and sometimes, existential doubts about their purpose. 
"Despite their differences, their collective goal is to escape, echoing Jan's determination to survive: I'll just do it all by myselves," the press release reads.

The Alters is due out on current-gen consoles and PC sometime in 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After 11 years, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has been, somewhat unceremoniously, shut down in favour of the newer, shinier Counter-Strike: 2. Whether you like it or not, Valve wants you playing CS2. For those who don't take their CS all too seriously, CS2 won't seem like much of a change from CS:GO, besides some grenade changes, more detailed maps, and a disappointing lack of fan favourite game modes. And for those who train their aim on the reg and line up their smoke grenades, CS2 might look the part but lacks the precision of CS:GO's movement and gunplay.
Still, CS2 captures what makes Counter-Strike tick and even if the foundation seems a little sparse and a touch shaky right now, I'm confident Valve have an FPS that'll supersede CS:GO in time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If Starbreeze themselves were actually a Payday 3 heisting team I suspect they'd be on the verge of putting money back into the vault at this stage - retracing their steps with bulging duffel bags, while apologising to security guards not so much for the whole bank robbery thing as for smashing so many utilities on their way out. Shortly after announcing plans to make the four-player PvE shooter less online-dependent, the developers have revealed that they're also reworking Payday 3's much-reviled progression system.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year, Nintendo ended eShop functionality for the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, marking the beginning of the end for these devices. Now, Nintendo has announced that online play and other device functionality that requires online communication is coming to an end, too. 
More specifically, Nintendo says online services for these devices will end in April 2024. 
As of early April 2024, online play and other functionality that uses online communication will end service for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U software. Thank you very much for your continued support of our products.
https://t.co/nOyzBImHCE
October 4, 2023
"In early April 2024, online play and other functionality that uses online communication will end for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U software," Nintendo's announcement reads. "This also includes cooperative play, internet rankings, and data distribution."
Nintendo says it will announce a specific end date and time at a later date and that it reserves the right to discontinue these online services earlier if "an event occurs that would make it difficult to continue online services" for the 3DS and Wii U. It also notes this includes software exclusive to the New Nintendo 3DS. 
The company then answers a number of questions in an FAQ section of the announcement. It notes that Pokemon Bank will still be usable following April 2024 and that "for the foreseeable future, it will still be possible to download update data and redownload purchased software and downloadable content from Nintendo eShop." 
The fan-favorite 3DS feature, StreetPass, will fortunately still work as it uses local communication between devices, but SpotPass, which uses online communication instead, will no longer be available after April 2024. 
For more, read Game Informer's farewell to the Nintendo Wii U eShop.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm close to being whatever the Assassin's Creed equivalent of a Pokémon genwunner is. It's not like I'm snobby about the newer, more action-oriented Creeds; I welcomed the shift brought in by Assassin's Creed Origins, which shook the series up a bit, and I loved Cassandra kicking her way around Ancient Greece. Valhalla, although it had a relative dearth of things to parkour around, was a fun open-world RPG. Which I suppose is the point.
Assassin's Creed hasn't been a game about a group of assassins following a creed and striking from the shadows for a long time. Here I would say that Basim, protagonist of Assassin's Creed Mirage kicks down the door and kills everyone in the room, except this new entry in the series is smaller, more focused, and once again concerned largely with stealth, and is all the better for it. So it's more appropriate to say Basim snuck in through an open window and is choking everyone out one by one.

For years, the Assassin’s Creed franchise has expanded the scope of its entries, offering ever longer adventures across increasingly vast open worlds. For players who first tried the series through those entries, Assassin’s Creed Mirage may be a shock. Set mainly within the single city of ninth-century Baghdad and playable to completion in under 20 hours, Mirage harkens back to the earliest entries starring Altaïr and Ezio. For more longtime fans, many elemen…]]></summary>

There's a lot to sift through there, which we'll get into next week, but we also found time towards the finish for some off-the-cuff chinwaggery about dream 4X or strategy game projects. What would the Oxide team make, if they didn't have to worry about budget, audience expectations or any of the other commercial factors that guide the creation of videogames? The answers may surprise you. They might also make you hungry.

It can be rare for a newer franchise to challenge a well-established genre leader for the throne, but that’s precisely what the Forza Motorsport series has done since its first entry in 2005. Since then, the sim-racing genre has featured dueling front-runners, with Gran Turismo and Forza Motorsport taking turns in the lead. The latest entry, simply titled Forza Motorsport, takes a back-to-basics approach to keep pace with its chief rival.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I was a computer science student, I developed a messaging app called HYPE with a few of my (more-talented) peers. It worked really well, and we even used it to talk during lectures, but of course we never released it out into the world and after leaving uni it was abandoned. Years later, I saw the brand called HYTE and my immediate reaction was "They stole our idea!"
Of course, my reading comprehension is poor, and HYTE - the iBuyPower PC case company - is unrelated to my unreleased, unannounced Linux-based chat app. 
And so it falls to me to tell you that if you don't have a knee-jerk reaction to four-letter words that look like acronyms but aren't, and you like small PC cases, you might be interested in this US deal for the HYTE Revolt 3. 
This critically-acclaimed Mini ITX PC case is down to $112 at Newegg or Ebay, a cut below its regular price of $200 and MSRP of $250. $112 is a bloody brilliant price for this case, especially as it comes with a pre-fitted 700W 80+ Gold SFX power supply.

When I played Super Mario Bros. Wonder in August, I came away extremely impressed by the creativity at play with the series' return to the 2D side of the coin. I enjoyed my time so much that I was upset when I had to relinquish the controller at the end of my demo session. Thankfully, as part of our cover story for our latest issue, I was able to get a lot more time with Super Mario Bros. Wonder. While a lot of that time was spent further exploring the levels I had already played, I was also the first to experience three courses that appeared as part of the Super Mario Bros. Wonder-focused Nintendo Direct in late August.

Activision have put up a trailer for nu-Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3's multiplayer, ahead of a full live reveal at the Call of Duty: Next event on 5th October. I caught the news on a social feed somewhere, went hunting for the Youtube version and, much to my distress, managed to dig up the multiplayer premiere for the original Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, released in 2011 - almost 12 years ago. 


Rather than just posting the correct video and going off to cry about my advancing seniority, I'm brazenly posting both so you can trace the evolution (or not) of this shootiest of first-person shooter franchises. It's bizarre to think of any game series being this venerable, and changing so much while remaining the same.

In the 11 years since the last 2D game launched, we've received multiple re-releases, two Super Mario Maker titles, two mainline 3D titles, and even a mobile auto-runner. After nearly two decades of the New Super Mario Bros. series dominating the 2D side of the iconic franchise, Super Mario Bros. Wonder represents a new era for the Mushroom Kingdom crew. To celebrate the impending release of this new 2D adventure on Switch, Super Mario Bros. Wonder graces the cover of our latest issue of Game Informer.

In his RPS review, Ed Thorn described it as "an action-RPG that wraps what could've been a wonderfully realised Gotham universe in a tired, slapdash mix of meaningless numbers and loot." I reviewed it myself as a freelancer and can't disagree with his verdict. Game ain't great. But I find myself itching to download and revisit this muddled open world contender all the same.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a fan of the modern Bethesda RPG, having spent nearly 100 hours with Fallout 4 - which, for me, is a lot more time than I'm usually willing to give up. My fondest memories lie with Oblivion, because I think it captured exploration beautifully. I liked emerging from a big cave as a big nobody and striking out along a cobbled path, excited to go for a summer's walk. Skyrim abandoned Oblivion's warmth for your average fantasyland, but kept the great outdoors.
If I don't have an objective in Starfield, I sort of freeze over and don't really know where to turn. And even if I do, I perform a deep sigh and open up my menus and curl myself into a pinball, ready to get pinged around the innards of whatever can lies beyond the airlock in front of me. So far, Starfield's adventuring forces me indoors and it's a shame.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kotaku is reporting that Naughty Dog, the PlayStation first-party studio behind The Last of Us and Uncharted franchises, has laid off at least 25 developers, cutting their contracts short. The layoffs reportedly began last week, according to two of Kotaku's sources and various departments, from art to production, were hit. The majority of those laid off were in Naughty Dog's quality assurance testing department. 
The 25 contract developers laid off were part of a downsizing at the studio, but Kotaku reports that full-time staff do not appear to be affected. The publication's sources say severance is not being offered to those laid off and those affected (as well as those still working at Naughty Dog) are "being pressured to keep the news quiet."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Forest Cathedral is an environmental thriller that hit Xbox Series X/S and PC earlier this year in March. Now, Game Informer can exclusively reveal it hits PlayStation 5 on October 31, making this a great spooky experience for the holiday. 
For the uninitiated, The Forest Cathedral is inspired by events surrounding real-life scientist Rachel Carson's investigation into Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, otherwise known as the harmful DDT pesticide. Publisher Whitethorn Games says this game is "a dramatic reimagining of Carson's environmental science book, Silent Spring." 
You can get a look at it in The Forest Cathedral PS5 release date trailer below: 


As you can see in the trailer above, in The Forest Cathedral, players take on the role of Rachel in her new field research biologist position on a mysterious island. What begins as simply completing weekly work tasks becomes something more horrific when Rachel learns about what DDT is doing to the area. Whitethorn says players "will slowly uncover the horrific effects of the pesticide using advanced environment technology to complete puzzles that weave together 3D exploration with 2D platforming." 

As far as gameplay goes, players switch between Rachel Carson in a 3D world and the "Little Man" inside the 2D world of Rachel's scanning tools. It's in this 2D world where players will solve puzzles and complete platforming challenges.
The Forest Cathedral is available right now on Xbox Series X/S and PC via Steam. It hits PS5 on Halloween.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel's Spider-Man is almost here. Set to hit PlayStation 5 exclusively on October 20, PlayStation and developer Insomniac Games have continued to ramp up excitement surrounding the sequel with trailers, gameplay, and more. And last night, PlayStation released a new extended 60-second TV spot that gives us a more cinematic look at these heroes' latest adventure. 
The trailer is CGI and it's gorgeous. We see Peter Parker and Miles Morales come to grips with the challenges before them, both in the suit and out of it; all to the backdrop of a massive fight in broad daylight against Venom. If this trailer is any indication, Venom is quite the formidable foe for these two. 
Check it out for yourself in the Marvel's Spider-Man 2 trailer below: 


As you can see, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 continues to look great, and fortunately, we don't have to wait long to get our hands on it because it hits PS5 on October 20. 
In the meantime, read about how Marvel's Spider-Man 2 features more than 65 suits and then read our thoughts on the game after going hands-on with it. Check out Game Informer's Marvel's Spider-Man 2 New Gameplay Today after that.

The new patch reverts companion behaviour to their pre-Patch 3 behaviour, for a less frustrating RPG experience. In even more momentous tidings, it re-shaves that cat everybody loves. Ah, videogames.

Designed by Volker Wertich, one of the original creators of The Settlers, the new village 'em up puts you in charge of medieval tribes scattered around an almost eerily scenic island chain. 


It's all about the little touches: check out those azure windmill blades, flickering in the breeze! And how about the little animations of people hefting barrels of water? Man, it makes me want to jump in there and start stamping on everything, wailing and babbling like a mad god. But let's not do that. Let's play the demo instead. It gives you three maps, and lands ahead of the game's early access launch on 13th December.

There are also fixes for a shader compilation bug that may, nonetheless, still exist for AMD GPUs when playing this latest iteration of the developer's free-to-play team and objective-based shooter. Many of the larger issues returning players have, such as the absence of Mac support, are yet to be addressed.

To get some insight into how the game came together and learn about working with Shigeru Miyamoto, we spoke with chief and programming director Yuji Kando and planning director Yutaka Hiramuki over e-mail.
Game Informer: In 2015, Shigeru Miyamoto said in an interview that Pikmin 4 development was “very close to completion.” Was that statement inaccurate at the time?
Kando: After the development for Pikmin 3 ended, we started development for Pikmin 4 as a small team.

A, of course, stands for Attacking by means of things like energy rifles, electro-batons and shotguns. B is for Back-stabbing, referring to the stealthy player who may stack objects so as to clamber into vents, and whack guards deftly in the noggin to escape detection.
And C is for Conversing, referring to the act of wooing civilians - who thus far seem miraculously unbothered by your menacing hooded appearance and sepulchral accent - so as to procure door codes and the location of keycards. You can see all these approaches in the game's new trailer, below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week ended with a dire flood of layoffs in the games industry, including Sega, Ubisoft, Blizzard, and Epic games. Unfortunately, this week seems to be following the trend – Team17, developer of the Worms series, and publisher of games like Blasphemous, Dredge, and more, has announced layoffs as well, according to Eurogamer.
The job losses, which are due to a "company restructure," will eliminate about 50 positions from the company, and the majority of those positions will be in the publisher's QA department. Eurogamer also reports the news was delivered to employees during an emergency town hall meeting this morning.
In addition to members of the QA team, Team17 CEO Michael Pattison will also be stepping down, according to a statement received by VG247. This stands in sharp contrast to many other recent layoffs, where executives had been exempt from cost-cutting measures. You can read the full statement below.
For more on the recent wave of layoffs, read about how Sega canceled several upcoming games and how Epic laid off over 800 people.

It's a game that's been on my radar since earlier this year: both because I love most anything related to pirates and because, well, Bilkins' Folly looks great. Between its visuals, throwback gameplay, nautical tunes, and modern reimaginings of old-school adventure gameplay, it caught my attention. And now it's finally out!
I spoke to developer Webbysoft, who is mostly just one person based in Australia, about Bilkins' Folly ahead of the game's release over email. We discussed the game's inspiration, the challenges of the adventure genre, the game's gibberish language, how the idea of it came from a missing wedding ring, and much more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Boomer shooter" is a recent video game genre term used to describe contemporary games that exist as throwbacks to the Doom-inspired era of first-person shooters where speed and firepower are everything. Phantom Fury is not the first game to explore this playground, and it likely won't be the last, but playing the demo left a good first impression. The visuals are cool, the shooting feels good, and protagonist Shelly “Bombshell” Harrison is not afraid to throw out a good one-liner when the mood strikes her.
Phantom Fury is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC sometime this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dark Side, the exciting sequel of the groundbreaking Driller, is ready for public testing!
Dark Side, like its predecessor, was released by Incentive Software Limited in 1988, shortly after Driller. The updated gameplay features a jetpack that allows you to leave the ground, providing a new and fresh perspective that emphasizes the excitement and challenges of exploring Tricuspid, the second alien moon of planet Evath.
This time, the vicious Ketars have scattered and hidden Energy Collection Devices (ECD) around their base to destroy your home planet. It’s up to you to destroy them first! The tricky part is many ECDs are connected to each other and can regenerate instantly, so you must figure out the right order to successfully complete your mission. 
Our reimplementation of the Freescape engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Dark Side support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC. Additionally, there are two playable demos if you want to test the game. Support for Amiga and AtariST will be available later! Please contact us if you have some other release.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.
