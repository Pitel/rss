        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some indie hits create a legion of copycats, but others, not so much. I don't think there are too many Papers, Pleaselikes, for example - perhaps for obvious reasons given that game's grim subject matter.

Lil' Guardsman is a Papers, Pleaselike though - and a seemingly delightful one. You play as 12-year-old Lil, who is a substitute guard at the castle gate for a fantasy kigndom, and you must decide who to admit and who to deny entry. It's out now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[astragon Entertainment and Mi'pu'mi Games have released Howl on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S today. It was initially released in November 2023 on PC and Switch.


Howl is one that escaped me. When I think back to November, it’s mostly a blur to me, so that’s no surprise. However, it looks interesting from screenshots and the title of the press release reads “critically acclaimed.” That phrase gets stretched pretty far in the PR world, but, sure enough, Opencritic shows a warm reception from the publications that covered it.




The announcement also describes Howl as folklore turn-based strategy. A strange howling turns anyone who hears it into werewolves. You play as a deaf heroine who is searching to cure it. From the trailer, it looks to be more of a puzzle game than a turn-based strategy title. You plan your moves in six steps, changing positions on the tiled field and completing actions to try and evade or take down enemies. If you’ll forgive the somewhat obscure reference, it reminds me of Trogdor the Board Game.


There are 60 stages through 4 chapters, and you unlock new abilities and upgrades as you progress through the world map. Most striking, however, is the art style, which looks like it’s hand-drawn in a simple storybook style. 


I’m bringing this up not just to warn PlayStation and Xbox players that it’s now available to their chosen platform but also for anyone else who, like me, might have missed it at first.


Howl is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, and PC.

With the character's inclusion, Fortnite will also be adding EMP Stealth Camo as a new item. It can render players nearly invisible for a brief amount of time. You can activate it as often as you like, though there is a cooldown timer you'll have to wait through in between uses.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After hoping for a release toward the end of 2023, we now know when the Death Stranding Director's Cut will be landing on iOS and Mac devices. 505 Games, the team handling the port, has confirmed the title will be delivered next week. 


The release will make the definitive version of Hideo Kojima's 2019 hit available to a substantial new audience.  It's playable for everyone with an iPhone 15 Pro or iPads and Macs with the M-series chip. It will be available for download via the Apple App Store on January 30. 




The Director's Cut was initially released for PlayStation 5 in September 2021. It was then followed with a PC iteration in March 2022. Within it comes the base game, as well as a new underground factory location, expanded story missions, and various delivery assists to make navigating terrain a bit easier. 


505 Games is publishing the port. The Death Stranding Director's Cut is being listed on the App Store for $39.99. However, those who preorder ahead of the January 30 launch can enjoy a nice 50% discount on their purchase. It's the first of potentially many future titles that Kojima has committed to bring to Apple's platforms. 


Players who own multiple newer Apple products should be aware that the game incorporates Apple's Special Delivery feature. This enables those with Mac and iOS devices to purchase the Director's Cut once and have it playable across all platforms. Just be sure to have space available, as the Death Stranding Director's Cut on iOS and Mac comes in at a sizeable 69.8 GB.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The team behind 2022's excellent movie-mystery Immortality is back with not one, but two new projects. Sam Barlow and Half Mermaid have stealthily launched Steam pages for Project C and Project D.


Both projects contain heavy redactions in their page descriptions and info, much like how Immortality was called "Project Ambrosio." Barlow responded to the teasers getting spotted by accounts like Wario64, though we don't have much more to go on now besides the pages themselves.




Project C is the new cinematic... something from Barlow and Half Mermaid, his studio that's produced both Telling Lies and Immortality. (Barlow's previous Her Story lists him as the sole developer and publisher.) You will appear to do something for the first time ever in a video game, for what that's worth.


Meanwhile, Project D is a survival horror game from the Half Mermaid crew. Keywords include "nurse," "1983," "nightmare," and "be careful." Seems like something worth paying attention to for Silent Hill fans, at the least.


Life preserved in the pictures


Alongside this news, Barlow and co. also confirmed a partnership with Lost in Cult for a new Design Works book about the making of Immortality. All that, plus Immortality hitting PlayStation today, makes for a big news day for the Half Mermaid team.


It's interesting to see the Half Mermaid crew tackle two projects, and tease them out at the same time. Immortality was an absolutely captivating game that easily stole a spot in my end-of-year favorites, so I'm keen to see what's next for them. Both a cinematic work and a survival horror effort makes me curious, though. We really only have a few screenshots and scattered text to go on, though. It's good fodder for all the House of Leaves fans, I guess.


We'll learn more about Project C and D soon, hopefully. In the mean time, play Immortality if you haven't, preferably with the lights off and sitting too close to the monitor.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is right around the corner on February 29, so Square Enix is capitalizing on the thirst for more Cloud and Sephiroth with special screenings of the CG-animated Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children film a week ahead of launch. 


Originally released nearly two decades ago in 2005, the Tetsuya Nomura-directed feature is a characteristically over-the-top look at the world of Final Fantasy VII two years after the events of the original game. The film's return to theaters is the result of a collaboration between Square Enix, Fathom Events, and Sony Pictures. It will mark the first time for the Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children Complete director's cut version to hit cinemas.

The screenings will be in theaters for just two days. Those who want to see Cloud's Buster Sword in the largest format possible can check out the English-dubbed version on February 21, followed by the subtitled version on February 22. The director's cut is a whopping 26 minutes longer than the theatrical release, packing in various visual improvements and around a thousand updated scenes. The story finds a mysterious new illness spreading quickly throughout the world, bringing old enemies back out of the woodwork and forcing Cloud to pick up his impossibly heavy blade and get back into action. 


If you do decide to head to the theater for this one next month, Square Enix wants you to prepare for a history lesson before the lights dim. Folks who show up early will be treated to exclusive introductory content like the history of Final Fantasy VII, how it connects to Advent Children, interviews with Tetsuya Nomura and Rebirth director Naoki Hamaguchi, and more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following some delays, Freedom Planet 2 finally made its PC debut in September 2022, and now it has its sights set on consoles. Publisher XSEED Games announced plans to bring developer GalaxyTrail's sequel to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch on April 4, 2024.


In addition to showing off the four heroines of Freedom Planet 2 and their high-speed exploits, the release date trailer previews a brand new mode. When Freedom Planet 2 hits consoles it will come with the oft-requested Boss Rush mode across all platforms, including a simultaneous update on PC. Split into two divisions with 17 boss challenges in each one, Boss Rush mode will be accessible via the in-game Battlesphere when it goes live. Beating the bosses in both divisions will unlock an in-game VIP room full of easter eggs that long-time fans should appreciate.




XSEED has digital releases set for all platforms, with the Switch eShop release offering 10% off pre-orders from now until a week after launch. The PlayStation release will include a bundle of both the PS4 and PS5 versions, and those who opt to check it out on Xbox will be able to take advantage of Smart Delivery to access the optimal version of the game on both platforms. 


I haven't played the sequel yet, but the first Freedom Planet was pretty much the ideal Sonic game I never knew I needed, so I'm psyched for this one to hit consoles. It all makes sense considering the series' origins as a Sonic the Hedgehog fangame by GalaxyTrail founder Sabrina DiDuro. If you can't wait until the console release, you can nab the sequel for the same price of $24.99 on Steam right now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're getting closer to Princess Peach's next act on the main stage. Princess Peach: Showtime! is coming to the Nintendo Switch in March, and Nintendo dropped a new trailer today teasing what's on the way.


The leader of the Mushroom Kingdom leaves the crown behind and takes on a series of new roles in the upcoming title. Many of which you can catch in the new Princess Peach: Showtime! trailer below. 




So far, we've seen Peach sport several different hats, including a cowgirl getup, detective 'fit, swordfighter ensemble, and even a patissiere costume complete with Yoshi's Cookie-inspired designs. 


The gist of Princess Peach: Showtime! revolves around Peach and a few of her closest toads putting on a show at the famed Sparkle Theater of the Mushroom Kingdom. However, shockingly to everyone, some bad guys arrive to heckle the performers and put an end to the show. 


Gameplay-wise, Peach will tackle a bunch of different roles as she travels from stage to stage in an effort to take down the nefarious Grape and the Sour Bunch. Yes, that is their real name.


To squash Grape and his crew, the Mushroom Kingdom Princess will take on numerous roles, including Swordfighter Peach, Patissiere Peach, Cowgirl Peach, Ninja Peach, Detective Peach, Kung Fu Peach, and likely several more that we haven't seen yet. 


Princess Peach: Showtime! gives us the Princess' first solo outing since 2005's Super Princess Peach on the Nintendo DS. It's one of the better non-Mario Mario games out there. The character is long overdue for a new outing of her own, especially after the character's strong depiction in The Super Mario Bros. Movie.


Peach will look to make Grape whine and go home when Princess Peach: Showtime! raises the curtains on March 22.

The "biggest impact" will be felt outside of core development, though the reductions will affect at least one major internal team - the developers of Legends Of Runeterra. Riot are also binning off the Riot Forge publishing label, under which third-party developers create smaller-scale games based on Riot's own intellectual properties.

But for the studio's next projects, it seems the mystery will begin before the games are even announced – today, two Steam listings were posted on Half Mermaid's developer page, but most of their information is redacted.
The games, currently called "Project C" and "Project D," have very few concrete details listed. White text blocks give the page a redacted look, so only a few words in each sentence are legible, and the images and videos in their galleries are surreal and vague. Obscure details are still details, however, so here's a breakdown of what we know about each game so far.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Full steam ahead!
We believe it quite impossible to be a shoot-'em-up lover and not have stumbled upon HOT-B’s cult classic Steel Empire, the 1992 Mega Drive-exclusive horizontal shmup that mesmerised players with incredible steampunk aesthetics, an epic soundtrack, and a stiff challenge. Far from forgotten, there have been in the past two re-releases/remasters of the game on console, one on Game Boy Advance back in 2005 and 3DS in 2014. Is this third HD revisit — based on the 2018 PC release — worth its price in coal or is it just a load of hot air? Strap in to find out.
The action takes place in a familiar yet bizarre post-industrial revolution civilisation during a great war waged between the nations of the Republic of Silverhead and the Motorhead Empire (no smirking in the back, now). In this alternate 19th century, the steam engine has become the world’s greatest invention causing military machine design to evolve into gigantic monsters of steel and fire that rule the land, the sea. and the skies. You take the role of a nameless Silverhead republican pilot onboard the aircraft carrier Rheinhalt. Despite being greatly outnumbered, the technology of Silverhead is more advanced than their opponent, evident through your choice of aircraft and the mighty 'Imamio Thunder' bomb devices that can cause devastating damage to the steel-dependent Motorhead military units.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s a little less than a month until Pacific Drive rolls out into the world. To get you ready for the game, Ironwood Studios has released a video that covers the core gameplay.


It isn’t hard to understand the basics of Pacific Drive, but there are a lot of deeper systems to keep in mind. For example, gathering anchor energy is important, but you might not realize how important it really is until you’re caught in an area with reality collapsing around you. So, you can learn from your mistakes like I did, or you can watch this video.




Having played Pacific Drive, I can tell you that this 10-minute video is pretty all-encompassing, covering car maintenance, survival, scavenging, and upgrading. If you’re not sure what the game is going to play like, this will tell you what it is and what it isn’t. Also, look at it this way, it will allow you to glide through the tutorial parts pretty easily.


I previewed Pacific Drive a while back, and while I have some reservations, my time with it left me excited to get my hands on the full experience. There’s a lot of elements of what I love mixed in there, and I’m wondering how well they’ll fare when stretched out to a full experience. I’m worried that the core gameplay loop will become repetitive, so I’m hoping to see a lot of surprises scattered about as you proceed further into the zone.


Pacific Drive is out on February 22, 2024 for PS4 and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've been itching to see retro games be given a bit of a pep in this modern gaming world, Nvidia's RTX modding toolkit is already realizing that dream. With the open beta now out, prepare yourselves for an upscaled return of some classics.


In a rather lengthy post, Nvidia has outlined exactly what the RTX Remix software is capable of. In a nutshell: it's a "cutting-edge modding platform" that allows for games from a bygone era to be given a bit of a remaster.




The above video shows what it can do. In this instance, we can see ray-tracing versions of Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind and Half-Life 2, complete with higher definition assets. We're already seeing it in the likes of Tomb Raider and Vice City, so expect a lot more to come out of the woodwork now Remix is out in beta.


Also comes with DLSS 3.5 and Ray Reconstruction


I suppose one of the questions modders may have is: will RTX Remix be compatible with any game? While it's designed to work with a lot of different titles, Nvidia says its "level of compatibility may vary depending on the complexity of the game’s assets and engine."


We know it works on older games because we've already seen it in action. The software "works best with DirectX 8 and 9 games with fixed function pipelines." Things like Hitman 2, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines, and Call of Duty 2 should work, as well as the aforementioned ones.


Whether you're sick of remasters, remakes, reboots, and other "re-" words or not, RTX Remix is probably going to see a boon in unofficial remasters of video games from yesterday that have been given a shiny new coat.

I'm currently burning one called Starry Night, which is a nice fresh scent but it's nowhere near as strong as I would like. I can never find fresh scents that are as long-lingering as the fruity or woody ones. Anyway, I have been discussing my new interest (and interrupting work meetings with pretend candle unboxing videos where I tell them to like and subscribe and check out my collab with WickManiac) with the rest of the Treehouse, which prompted us to talk about the idea of gamer candles. They exist! They're just candles of lies.

Still, it seems as if it's not enough to quench all that thirst for Pokémon content, as YouTuber ToastedShoes posted a video of a modded version of the game, replacing the pals with Pokémon and making the main character Ash.




Mechanics-wise, Palworld seems to remain essentially the same, but it feels like a weird new thing. It's hard to avoid looking at Misty holding a shotgun and not think of the possibilities for a zombie apocalypse game set in the world of Pokémon.



The mod isn't out yet for everyone, but Nintendo has shown they're watching by immediately taking down ToastedShoes' original a…]]></summary>

The importance of Project Zomboid's Build 42 cannot be overstated. The last major revision of the long-lasting indie zombie simulator, Build 41, came out in December 2021. From that point onwards, the majority of Zomboid's big and meaningful content and feature updates had been getting rolled up into Build 41. Examples include a substantial performance uplift, the addition of wildlife and animal/ husbandry, medieval-esque tools, fluid mechanics, map expansion, skyscrapers and bunkers, and loads more.

Currently, those playing on Game Pass still don't have the ability to join or create dedicated servers for up to 32-player multiplayer like their mates on Steam can. Instead, they remain limited to just 2-4-player co-op via the use of friend codes, meaning that Game Pass players aren't having quite the same experience as their Steam counterparts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Basically the only sort of strategy games I like are city builders, so I was interested in the playtest for El Dorado: The Golden City Builder, which casts you as the leader of an ancient Mayan-ish city. The playtest is only the prologue, but the eventual goal is to take over the Yucatán peninsula, and if nothing else it's refreshing to see a city-builder that doesn't feel overwhelmingly European. It also has a complicated system of religion. Whereas in a similarly polytheistic game like Zeus, the gods would turn up to stomp on buildings and/or bless them, at fairly large intervals, in El Dorado I was getting a home immolated every few days. Building shrines that have an area of effect, and that require resources to run and protect your town, is its own supply chain in El Dorado. This is a very interesting idea that I liked.
But. The aforementioned deities are figures from Maya mythology, and the Yucatán peninsula is the bit where the Mayans lived, so I just find it a bit sus the word "Mayan" does not appear anywhere on the Steam page or in the press release materials. Sometimes said materials say "the Yucatán peninsula", and sometimes "the mystical land of Jukatan", which could well be an innocent translation mistake, but doesn't make me less sus. I've hedged my bets by saying "Mayan-ish" - just as an uncharitable person could say the devs are doing...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Phantom Liberty now done and dusted, CD Projekt Red is keen to get cracking on some new projects. With that in-mind, it seems the studio is now looking to make some headway on the new Witcher saga.


That's according to a recent report from Reuters. The developer's joint CEO, Adam Badowski, tells the publication that the team is aiming to start the "production phase" on the first entry in the next set of Witcher games, currently codenamed Polaris.




Badowski goes on to say that the company would like to "have around 400 people working on the project by the middle of the year." CDPR is also at the "conceptual phase" regarding the follow-up to Cyberpunk 2077, with around 80 people expected to be working on that game by the end of 2024. CD Projekt Red has also apparently considered multiplayer elements for the new Cyberpunk, but isn't discussing details right now.


Win some, lose some


On top of this, a recent post on Twitter announced that Phantom Liberty has been nominated for "Outstanding Visual Effects in a Real-Time Project" at the 22nd Annual Visual Effects Society Award.


The Cyberpunk DLC was not only the culmination of a lot of work fixing the glaring issues that plagued the game, but it was also something of a swansong for the dystopian RPG. CD Projekt Red may well take what harsh lessons it's learned and apply them to the sequel.


However, the Reuters report goes on to say that the studio may be looking into artificial intelligence for some of its future releases. Michal Nowakowsk said he thinks "AI is something that can help improve certain processes in game production," but added that it couldn't "replace people." Make of that what you will.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio reset its flagship series with Yakuza: Like a Dragon, an aptly named title that saw newcomer Ichiban Kasuga take the lead in RPG hero fashion. With Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, RGG returns to the role-playing formula, with one foot in the future and the other in the past.


While Ichiban is back to lead, his predecessor Kazuma Kiryu returns, too. At first, the duo form a party together and then, eventually, split into two parties with each protagonist as their own leader. And while I dig a lot about what this does for the story, and the ways in which RGG Studio has clearly upgraded its blueprint from Y:LAD, it’s hard not to notice the stumbles it makes along the way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blake Hester is hard at work on Game Informer’s full review of the exceptionally long Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, but while he is gathering his final thoughts, I wanted to share my impressions so far.
Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth can be deathly serious when it wants to be. A character with a negative first encounter with the game’s protagonist, Ichiban, soon reveals he is in over his head with the local Yakuza and spent time in jail, leading to heartbreaking difficulties with his significant other. Ichiban is sympathetic and builds him up with his unique and often excessive brand of optimism. The moment is well-written and genuinely moving. Those moments (at least in the first 11 hours) are rare and hit hard as a result.

The majority of the game is an absurdist fantasy in a believab…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Though it hasn't made its way onto Destructoid's list of most hotly anticipated titles of 2024, Rocksteady Studios' Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League sure as heck is coming. Due to release on February 2, Suicide Squad is also getting a suite of post-launch content, in true live-service fashion.


The very first batch of this content has only just been revealed, in fact, giving players a taste of what's to come over the next couple of months. It should come as no surprise that much of what's been revealed is classic live-service fare. Notably, not only was Rocksteady quite unshy about the game's live-service leanings for some time now, but the whole thing got leaked not too long ago, adding even more fuel to the proverbial fire.

Remember the range of pastel-coloured Joy-Con controllers that released last summer? It sure would have been cool to get one of those adorable pink ones for the right controller, wouldn't it? Ponder these questions no longer! Nintendo has today revealed a new set of pastel pink Switch Joy-Con controllers which will be coming our way on 22nd March.
The new set will launch alongside Princess Peach: Showtime! (naturally) and will cost $79.99 (or your regional equivalent). These will be coming to "select retailers" and will also be available on My Nintendo Store for a limited time. Why for a limited time, you might ask? Because reasons.

Nintendo has revealed a brand-new trailer for the upcoming Princess Peach: Showtime! on Nintendo Switch, launching on March 22nd, 2024.
While the trailer is light on story elements, we get to see a whole bunch of cool costumes from the game, including the newly revealed Ninja Peach and Cowgirl Peach. Previously revealed costumes include Swordfighter Peach, Detective Peach (no relation to Detective Pikachu... we think), and Kung Fu Peach.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've stepped into the gaming world for even a yoctosecond these past few days, you'll have heard of Palworld. Maybe it's a bit cliché to say it's taking the industry by storm, but the data shows just how massive it's been in such a short span of time.


We've already spoken about how the game has been smashing Steam records, but the numbers just keep going up and up. At the time of writing, not only has Palworld surpassed 1.8 million players within the last few minutes, but it's also become the second-most-played Steam game ever, according to stats from SteamDB. This puts it ahead of Valve's own Counter-Strike 2.




On top of that, a recent tweet from the developer says the game has now sold more than six million copies. That's in the space of four days, remember?


Let me catch my breath, please!


I seriously can't keep up with the figures. Between pitching this story and writing these very words, Palworld seems to keep breaking expectations. By the time this article gets published, I'm anticipating news about how it's elevated itself above human comprehension and has taken over the very cosmos.


But how long can something like this last? It's not even been a week, but the number of people playing has exceeded what anyone could have predicted. It's knocked the Steam Deck off its number one spot, which is something that even the most hyped-up games struggle to do.


And the best part is, it is still in Early Access. It's pretty bug-ridden (it's straight up crashed my Xbox twice already, to the point where I thought it had bricked the console at one point), but there's something about a "Pokémon-with-guns" game that's got everyone talking. Surely the bubble will burst soon, yeah?

And speaking of Princess Peach: Showtime, in the latest gameplay trailer for it released today, we get a glimpse at several new iterations of the titular character, including Ninja Peach, Cowgirl Peach, and Kung-Fu Peach, as well as new looks at others like Patissiere Peach, Detective Peach, and Swordfighter Peach.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One might say that Steam has something of a reputation when it comes to video game sales. We get quite a few of them throughout the year, and this latest one will appeal to your inner pirate (and ninja. Don't forget the ninjas).


As of January 22, the Steam Pirates vs. Ninjas Fest began, providing a host of discounts on all things related to the aforementioned buccaneer and/or stealth assassin lifestyle. The best way to get an idea of what exactly is in the sale is to open the link above, but the video below gives a quick overview of what to expect. 




You'll find games like Sekiro, Ninja Gaiden: Master Collection, Pillars of Eternity II, Secret of Monkey Island, TMNT: Shredder's Revenge, and may more as part of the event. Essentially, if it's a pirate or ninja-themed game, it's probably here.


From laissez-faire economics to bootleggin'


Personally, I'm tempted by Monkey Island, as it's still something I haven't got round to playing yet. From the ninja category...well, you can't go massively wrong with the original Shadow Warrior. Ah, 3D Realms. Whatever happened to you? Oh, yeah. You were acquired by Embracer Group.


It feels like we've had one Steam sale event already since 2024 began. That's because we did. The Capitalism and Economy Fest was just a couple of weeks ago. These things tend to come around pretty quickly, I find.


Anyway, the Steam Pirates vs. Ninjas Fest is ongoing until Monday, 29 January. So the standard week-long event for these types of sales. Blow me down, me hearties, etc.

When a game cites as inspiration Papers, Please and classic Lucasarts point-and-clicks, it’s hard not to be curious, if a little cautious in your optimism. That’s exactly where Toronto-founded developer Hilltop Studios is coming from with Lil’ Guardsman – and it's come up with something pretty great.
The game starts with an interesting parenting decision by Hamish, a guardsman in the fantasy kingdom of “The Sprawl”. He has an important bet to place at the goblinball arena so, naturally, he asks his 12-year-old daughter, Lil, to cover his shift at the guard shed. That decision kicks off a series of events that run the gamut from time-travelling border control duty, to a fantasy game show, to all-out war.

Developers RGG Studio revealed, a full two weeks before launch, that Valve had awarded it coveted Verified status – a mark of honour for games that run, control, and generally operate well on the handheld.
What that golden sticker doesn’t explain is that to keep above a suitable 30fps, Infinite Wealth does demand that you swing the stolen bicycle of quality reductions directly into the soft skull of its graphical settings. It’s perfectly doable, mind, so if LADding around Hawaii sounds like as much fun to you as Ed’s review makes it seem, read on to find out how Infinite Wealth gets on with the Steam Deck and Steam Deck OLED.

The bar for the fighting game genre has been uppercut to astronomical heights in recent years. Exceptional one-on-one combat remains the primary bullet point, but other series have complimented their packages with robust suites of destinations, from cinematic story campaigns to comprehensive training dojos. Although Tekken 8’s fighting remains a treat thanks to some neat tweaks to its strong formula, the rest of the package, while respectable, falls short of some of its contemporaries.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my oldest memories is of a time when my sister wouldn’t let my Ghostbusters action figures bust ghosts in her Barbie doll house. The exclusion was my only major exposure to the toy.


I did watch the hit 2023 movie, which I enjoyed. I think it was a fun idea to focus on the generational impacts the toy had on women rather than try to contrive some sort of hero’s journey out of it. Wait… it was a hero’s journey! That structure shows up in the strangest places.


Anyway, that’s not the reason I bought 1993’s Barbie Super Model. I did it because I’m still recovering from one of the worst games I’ve ever played. I need some comforting shovelware. Gosh, did I get it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you feel recent roguelite games have been missing that platform fighter touch, Spiritfall is here to answer the call. Developer Gentle Giant's action game takes notes from Super Smash Bros., Brawlhalla, and similarly hectic platform fighter fare, and it's set to launch in full on February 28, 2024.


Spiritfall has been available in Early Access since April 3, 2023, and has garnered 'Very Positive' reviews from players in the months since. The release date news came along with a new animated trailer that shows off some slick cinematics and a sample of the fast-paced action at the heart of it all. 




When Spiritfall shared its Early Access update roadmap back in November, the devs detailed a few of the additions on the way to the full version. These include the final region and boss fight along with a new optional boss, fifth alternate weapon form, all challenge levels, and "more surprises." Gentle Giant has stayed pretty active in updating the game since it became available, knocking out 10 monthly content updates on top of the usual intermittent hotfixes. 


Even if you haven't played it for yourself yet, you can certainly see that platform brawler style at work in the trailer. Spiritfall combines that frantic fighting with roguelite features such as randomly generated maps and the ability to unlock new powers, upgrade skills, and gather a bunch of weapons to make the going a little less tough for each successive run. Brawlhalla by way of Dead Cells will no doubt be enough of a hook for most to at least dip their toes in what this one has to offer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Umbrella Academy meets Gekkoukan High. With Persona 3 Reload launching next week, Atlus West's YouTube released an out-of-the-blue live-action commercial with Aidan Gallagher.




Persona 3 Reload is an RPG/life sim where you take on the role of Makoto Yuki, a recent transfer to Gekkoukan High. He then becomes a member of the Specialized Extracurricular Execution Squad (S.E.E.S) and takes on the many levels of Tartarus during the elusive Dark Hour at midnight. 


The almost minute-and-a-half-long trailer, titled "Seal Your Fate", features The Umbrella Academy actor casually taking a stroll through the halls of Gekkoukan High and Tartarus and, of course, monologuing about time. Aidan becomes an in-game character at some points, ending off with slaying a Shadow himself. It's a weird mix …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Teyon has announced that RoboCop: Rogue City is getting a content update that will include new game plus, a new difficulty, and an Auto9 skin. It’s available now on PC, with the console versions getting it tomorrow.


RoboCop: Rogue City was a pleasant surprise last year. The licensed title went on to win a prestigious “On Zoey’s favorite games of 2023 list” award, one of the most unprestigious honors in the industry. One complaint I did have about the game is that I wanted to play it again after I completed it, but I didn’t want to start over from scratch. Now, it’s finally safe to reinstall it now that it will be getting new game plus.




On top of that, there’s a new, harder difficulty based on Murphy’s frequent utterance, “There Will Be Trouble.” Not much more has been revealed about the difficulty, but it’s safe to say it will be more difficult. Personally, I like playing as a walking tank, so I’m not sure being squishier will make the game more fun for me.


Finally, the Auto9 pistol gets a new skin once you complete the game. This one is gold plated, which is nicely garish. If you’re not familiar, RoboCop does allow you to pick up discarded guns off of enemies, but Murphy’s main sidearm never stops being effective. Rarely would I use anything else, except when it came to boss battles. However, not once did I stop and think it would be better if it was more ostentatious.


RoboCop: Rogue City is available for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. The new game plus patch has been released on PC, with the console versions getting it tomorrow.

The past couple of years have been pretty great for the Persona series on Switch. But the upcoming remake of Persona 3 — titled Persona 3 Reload — is skipping the hybrid console entirely. That's always been the plan, but it doesn't mean the idea isn't there at all, says director Takuya Yamaguchi.
Yamaguchi and producer Ryota Niitsuma recently spoke to the Spanish video game outlet Atomix (partially translated by Persona Youtuber Faz on Twitter). During the interview, Atomix asked about a Nintendo Switch version of the remake — given that Persona 3 Portable, Persona 4 Golden, and Persona 5 Royal have all made their way to the hybrid console and have all been well received.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Nvidia tools used to create that raytraced Portal mod and other fanciness are now in open beta, inviting all and sundry to jazz up everything from Deus Ex to Garry's Mod. Nvidia's RTX Remix tech lets people fancify old games by injecting fancy modern lighting, new models, textures 'remastered' by AI, new environmental decoration, and other such fanciness, even if the game doesn't have mod support. I'll be curious to see what people make with this, though I am wary of artlessly pumping new tech into old games.

Season 1 will kick off in March and includes the most famous villain in the DC roster: The Joker. Not only is The Joker joining the game, but he'll be a new playable member of the Suicide Squad. 
Notably, this take on The Joker is not the Mark Hamill-voiced character from the Batman: Arkham series. Instead, Brainiac is pulling Elseworlds together in an attempt to merge them into a unified multiverse. This is how The Joker in Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League joins the roster. In his universe, he was already a member of the Suicide Squad. His playstyle is fast and dynamic and requires players to stay moving, accor…]]></summary>

As highlighted in the Finish Your Story trailer, Cody Rhodes will don the game's cover when it releases on March 8. For the Deluxe Edition, former WWE Women's Champions Bianca Belair and Rhea Ripley have earned that honor.

        <updated>2024-01-22T18:30:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You may have noticed that at the bottom corner of your screen in Palworld, there is a string of numbers indicating what version you're playing. Steam and Xbox Game Pass have different versions, and here's why. 


A report from Windows Central highlighted comments from Pocketpair reps in the Palworld Discord server. There, Pocketpair's community manager, Bucky, explained a bit about what's going on with the different versions. The problem is that every game's version has to go through Microsoft's certification queue. This is something Pocketpair has no control over, though the team is "desperately trying to speed up," it highlights on Discord. 



So there are actually two separate versions of the game, "because the fundamental architecture is different," with version 1.2.0 awaiting certification from Microsoft. This isn't an act of malice on Xbox's part, though there are a few differences between the two versions. Though the version on Microsoft's Xbox One claims multiplayer is available, it isn't. Pocketpair also noted it's aware of "serious bugs" impacting servers, multiplayer, and more in an update on Twitter. 




There are also minor differences - bugs, some would call a few of them - such as the occasional lack of console keys on screen but I've been lucky to avoid most of them. These will also be fixed eventually, and it will take time before "content parity" is reached between PC and Xbox. 



It's argued that Xbox isn't necessarily "behind," but yet it is. Our list of differences demonstrates that this is the case. Nevertheless, you can enjoy the game on Xbox Game Pass without really noticing you're playing an earlier build. 


Until features parity is reached, keep collecting Pals, building weapons, and having fun with this survival game that shocked the world by being one of 2024's first hits.

        <updated>2024-01-22T18:15:50.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ratalaika has announced that they’re publishing a collection of the two modern NES titles of the The Adventures of Panzer series. The Adventures of Panzer: Legacy Collection comes to Xbox Series X|S, PS4, PS5, and Switch on January 26, 2024.


The original Adventures of Panzer title was released back in 2021 by Pixelcraft Games. It was built in NES Maker, which means that it runs on original NES hardware. A Kickstarter in 2022 allowed them to also publish the game on cartridge. The Adventures of Panzer 2 followed it up in 2023, and also went through Kickstarter for physical publishing.




Both games are action platformers, both touting a humorous and light-hearted narrative. The first game sees the eponymous Panzer traveling to five different levels to try and assemble his old team. The second game, set a year after the events of the first, sees that team fighting “a new evil.” In addition to being longer at 9 levels, you're also able to switch between the four characters.


Not much is said about the added features of the port, if any.


The NES is my happy place. Even though I was too young for it to really make an impact on my childhood, I’ve grown to love the simple graphics common on the system enforced by its hardware limitations. What I find weird about Adventures of Panzer is that the little characters look like they’re in a completely different resolution than the rest of the game, but they’re not, so maybe the pixel doubling is just a design decision. Weird.


The Adventures of Panzer: Legacy Collection releases on Xbox Series X|S, PS4, PS5, and Switch on January 26, 2024. It’s worth noting that at $8.99, the collection is roughly $2 more than buying the two games individually for PC on itch.io.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pocketpair's monster-collecting survival game Palworld has rekindled the eternal debate over what exactly constitutes a breach of copyright. While the game's mechanics are more reminiscent of Ark: Survival Evolved and other tree-punching, template-arranging wilderness sims, its monsters owe obvious debts to Nintendo and Game Freaks' Pokémon games. 
The developers have something of a track record on this front, with their older early access release Craftopia freely stirring in nods to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. But what separates copyright infringement from a flagrant, but perfectly legal rip-off? Given that a lot of people are making the case for Palworld being copyright theft online, I thought it might be useful to seek insight from (ominous roll of thunder) an actual lawyer.

You may remember Pathea Games' My Time at Sandrock, a life sim game released late last November that we weren’t massively enthused with. We awarded it a 5/10 in our review, saying that the launch version's "bland presentation and technical hiccups" affected this sequel to My Time at Portia. The Switch version sits with a Metascore of 62 from 11 critic reviews at the time of writing, although the PC version stands at 81.
Despite our reservations, this cozy game held a lot of potential and in the months since, the development team at Pathea has been hard at work to correct flaws and bring in new content to keep players engaged. Arguably its biggest update on Switch — version 1.1.4 — is due out imminently, and to get a better sense of what it contains and what’s on the horizon, we recently sat down for a lengthy conversation with some key staff on the Sandrock team to discuss its past and, crucially, its future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atari has announced that qomp2, the follow-up to the 2021 Pong continuation, will be released on February 20 on PC and console.


qomp was a game that dared to ask dangerous questions like, “What would happen if the Pong ball escaped from the confines of the court and went on an adventure?” I’m not sure how you extrapolate further on that, but Atari and Graphite Lab are going to try. They promise “An enigmatic story of doubt, fear, and self-acceptance, told wordlessly through simple effects and gameplay.” Sounds appropriately depressing.


Alongside the announcement of the release date, they released a short video of the Pong ball being interviewed in vertical cell-phone ratio, and I kind of hate it. I wonder if it’s the knee-jerk revulsion I have toward social media that’s the problem.


I didn’t play the original qomp, but it does sound like a fun premise. For a little while, at least. The first game was only played using a single button, but qomp2 adds a second one that is used for dash. It’s a logical evolution. Pong used no buttons, qomp used one, and qomp2 will use two of them.


This falls in line with Atari’s new focus on smaller games that leverage their existing brands. It’s a bit interesting that, while the original game was created by a group of indie developers under Stuffed Wombat, qomp2 has been handed off to Atari’s frequent collaborator, Graphite Lab. I have to wonder if they’ll be able to capture the same charm and impact of the original qomp.


qomp2 will launch for PC, Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 4 and 5 on February 20, 2024.

While that reveal included details about the survival aspects of the game, including multiplayer, crafting, and farming, viewers honed in on the idea of it being Pokémon but with guns. You can capture Pokémon-like monsters called Pals in special balls (and you can capture humans, too), but it's smart to shoot them or hack at them with an axe first to lower their health. And then, once under your command, you can give them their own guns to use, of course.

        <updated>2024-01-22T15:57:38.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, many of us were excited to see the official reveal trailer of MachineGames' upcoming Indiana Jones title The Great Circle. But footage shown at Developer Direct last week appears to be hinting at the return of Quake.


During the showcase of the upcoming Indiana Jones release – at around the 11:35 mark – we see a quick shot of a whiteboard, covered in barely legible red ink. However, among these scrawls you can clearly make out the iconic logo from the first Quake game.




Just above that, it's also possible to make out the characters "AKE 6." Given that the first letter is almost cut off from the screen, it could be inferred that this is the other half of the word "QUAKE."


Indy goes gothic


This could easily be nothing more than a throwaway reference, but the fact that it appears at all is interesting. Now, you don't need me to tell you that there's been no confirmation of any Quake projects in the pipeline. At least none that we're aware of.


Having said that, with developer MachineGames taking the reins on the modern Wolfenstein titles – not to mention last year's Quake 2 remaster, in which the studio contributed new maps – no one would be surprised if the team turned its attention to the original Quake.


Whether this would be a reboot or a new entry cannot be said, but given that the number six is present in the Indiana Jones trailer, it could be a continuation. If you're thinking there are only four games in the Quake series, consider Quake Champions the fifth installment. Or even Enemy Territory: Quake Wars.


In any case, these are just rumors at the moment. Chances are, if anyone was going to bring the legendary FPS back, who better than id Software? But MachineGames would definitely be a solid choice, so we'll just have to wait and see if the hidden clue in the video is more than just an Easter egg.

        <updated>2024-01-22T15:47:27.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Outside of Resident Evil, Alone in the Dark is one of the most influential survival horror games of all time. While we wait for Pieces Interactive's take on the upcoming reimagining, THQ Nordic has shown what you can expect if you opt for the special version of the game.


Over on the publisher's YouTube channel (as spotted by Bloody Disgusting), we get a little showcase on the Alone in the Dark bonuses that come with the Deluxe Edition. For starters, there are some "authentic Vintage Horror Filters," as well as the director's commentary, if that's your thing.




But the one that will strike a chord with older fans is the "1992 Costume Pack." This – as the name implies – gives the new game the same, low-poly look that the original AITD release had all the way back in the early 90s.


"Ma'am, please stop staring at my triangular nose."


Specifically, it affects the models, turning them from their more modern, highly detailed selves to how they originally looked. It's a nice little way of seeing just how far we've come in terms of video game visuals. Also, nostalgia. Nostalgia is good as well.


While it's been tough for Alone in the Dark to keep its head above the water – what with some mediocre reboots and new installments – this could be the one that reignites interest in the iconic series once more.


I'll tell you for why: For me, personally, this latest attempt to breathe new life into the franchise has been penned by Mikael Hedberg. Even if you don't recognize the name, horror fans will know his work from Amnesia: The Dark Descent, Amnesia: Rebirth, and – more importantly – SOMA. That's enough to get me excited for March 20, at least.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While there's nothing wrong with playing the remake of Resident Evil 4 as intended, some have been hoping for a first-person view. The VR update does allow for that, but now there is a mod for those that don't have a headset but still want a first-person RE4 experience.


As noted by PCGamer, Nexus Mods user elsuperaguas has released the beta version of a mod for Resident Evil 4 that switches the perspective. Now, without having to use the PSVR 2, you can play last year's remake in glorious first-person.




A recent video from the YouTube channel Residence of Evil shows it in action. It's as you would expect, bringing RE4 more in-line with the seventh and eighth installments in Capcom's iconic survival horror series.


Even Leon's curtains don't get in the way


There are some things you might want to take into account before you install the mod, however. On the download page, elsuperaguas says you will need to install a few things before you can play RE4 in first-person.


Those things are:



1. "Headless Leon" mod so you don't see inside Leon's head.
2. "Laser for every handgun" to fix the misalign of the laser beam.
3. "Invisible Weird Headgears" so you don't see the accessories.




You can also install "Headless Main Characters" if you want to play as Ashley or the Mercenaries content. Once all that's done, you should be good to go.


Unsurprisingly, we declared Resident Evil 4 the best remake/remaster of 2023. Much like the modern takes on RE2 and RE3, Capcom did a fantastic job of making the classic game feel fresh without losing what made the original highly praised special.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Does Apollo justice.
After the success of the original three Ace Attorney games, series creator Shu Takumi was ready to end Phoenix Wright's story. But the world wasn't done with these surprisingly intriguing lawyer games, and so he had to figure out how to make a new game without re-treading old ground. Thus, Apollo Justice, pointy-haired greenhorn lawyer, was born – and Phoenix was unceremoniously disbarred. The following three games, now serialised as the Apollo Justice Trilogy, serve as Apollo's version of Phoenix's story – but because of that tension between Takumi's wants and the players' needs, Apollo never quite gets the spotlight all to himself.
We begin with Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney, set seven years after Trials and Tribulations. In that time, a lot has happened, and the familiar angles of Wright's face are buried behind stubble, grime, and a deep sense of ennui after having lost his attorney's badge. But Apollo Justice, our new main character, isn't going to give up that easily, and joins the Wright Anything Agency (formerly known as the Wright & Co. Law Offices) hoping to make a real difference to the legal profession. Unfortunately for him, he's entered his career during the Dark Age Of The Law, where cowboy prosecutors and manipulative murderers will stop at nothing to get the results they want.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For a series that's defined by its trials and elaborate murder cases, the greatest crime in Ace Attorney history is arguably one we never get to see or take part in. Okay, maybe crime is too strong a word. Miscarriage of justice is perhaps more appropriate, and specifically that of Apollo Justice, the cover star of this latest trilogy in Capcom's beloved lawyer 'em up. Except poor old Apollo isn't really what holds this collection of Ace Attorneys 4, 5 and 6 together at all. Sure, he features in all of them, but at the end of the day, it's still the series' original bluffer supreme Phoenix Wright who heads up most of the casework here, relegating his new protegee back to bench-warming duties almost as soon as Apollo's debut game rolls its credits. What's more, he quickly has to share that space with Athena Cykes, another new hotshot lawyer that enters the firm in Dual Destinies and continues the scrappy defence trifecta in Spirit Of Justice.
The result is a set of games that feel considerably wobblier than Capcom's first and more robust Ace Attorney trilogy, and quite a bit more unfocused than the more recent Victorian-era spin-off, The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles. But despite a slightly unsure start, there are still plenty of career highs to be found here for Wright, Cykes and Justice, and Spirit Of Justice in particular remains one of the series' best entries to date. Those new to Ace Attorney should absolutely begin their journey elsewhere, but for series completionists, the Apollo Justice Trilogy is quite the welcome development.

Outsiders of the Ace Attorney series might not be familiar with the name Apollo Justice, but fans know the character is a big deal. He's second only to Phoenix Wright in terms of playable appearances, and his new collection, the Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney Trilogy, gathers all of those outings in one convenient package. While there's not much new content, quality-of-life improvements and a visual overhaul do a lot to modernize Apollo's courtroom saga, making it a worthwhile journey for fans new and old.

This week, my eye was caught by dozens upon dozens of spam accounts hijacking the tag to promote cryptocurrency garbage. Twitter's journey to uselessness continues. But after reporting dozens of accounts in the vain hope that Twitter might at least knock these particular bots offline (knowing it'll never actually address the wider problem), I was delighted to admire a great many attractive and interesting indie games.

The Switch has seen a bevy of Ace Attorney games over the past several years, and that's not stopping anytime soon, as Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney Trilogy will be launching this week on January 25th, 2024.
If that's not enough, however, then the good news is that fans can likely look forward to many more titles from the visual novel franchise in the future, as a recent interview from 4Gamer with producer Kenichi Hashimoto (thanks, Nintendo Everything) pretty much confirms that the series will never end.

Many speculated Piranha Bytes was another casualty in owner Embracer Group's purge of studios that began last year after a planned $2 billion deal with Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group fell through in 2023.


Studio closures at the hands of Embracer include Saints Row developer Volition Games and reformed TeamSplitters team Free Radical Design. Game Informer reached out to Piranha Bytes following last week's speculation to see if it was, indeed, another closure at the hands of Embracer, and today, studio CEO Michael Rüve responded, stating the studio's situation right now is difficult but that people shouldn't w…]]></summary>

Soapbox features enable our individual writers and contributors to voice their opinions on hot topics and random stuff they've been chewing over. Today, Lowell locks and loads up the Pokémon-inspired game that's been the talk of the town since it launched on Steam and Xbox Game Pass last week...

You might’ve heard about this little game called Palworld by now – it seems like everyone and their Growlithe is playing this Pokémon-with-guns crafting adventure. I largely ignored it leading up to its beta release as it seemed more of a gimmick than an actually compelling game, and only booted it up because I got commissioned to write a few guides for it elsewhere.

You've got a small, diminutive hero with a nasty little blade up his sleeve, a haunting and melancholy piano score, a beautiful hand-drawn animation style, and lots of mean-looking creatures to fight. Then again, the trailer also makes it clear there are lots and lots of spikes and traps to navigate here, which puts me more in the mind of Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown. Either way, I'm well up for another platforming-Metroidy hybrid, and developers Gami Studio have announced that there's Steam demo coming in February.

While there is a certain fear of burnout in the creator's message, the "insane" and "enthralling" scenario has us interested to see what the team has been cooking up.

As of this morning, it's among the most-played games in the world, one of just six to exceed one million concurrent players on Steam. Right now, it's doing almost twice the numbers of Steam's usual chart-topper Counter-Strike 2. We have entered the Pal Age, it seems - but how long will the feeding frenzy last? How much is owing to it releasing during the quiet time of year with a meme-ish premise, while capitalising on pent-up demand for a proper PC version of Nintendo's monster-catching series? Much will depend, I think, on how quickly developers Pocketpair can update it and stay ahead of the usual early access game avalanche of community requests and complaints.

Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is finally here and has quickly been racking up praise from seemingly everyone who plays it. With such acclaim, it was only going to be a matter of time before speculation began about what the Ubisoft Montpellier team would turn their talents to next and it seems like the devs themselves have some pretty big dreams.
Last week, two of the game's developers, Christophe Pic (world director) and Rémi Boutin (senior game designer), hosted an 'Ask Us Anything' chat on the r/metroidvania Reddit forum during which they were asked a series of questions about the game, its inspirations and what it means to the Prince of Persia series as a whole.

Welcome one and all to another week of addled product journalism care of your ever-salivating host, the Maw, ravenous hype god and certainly not a silly metaphor I’ve come up with to make my job sound grander than it should be.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nobody is surprised that Palworld turned into a big hit. Gamers love Pokémon, guns, and surviving. It should come as no big surprise that a game that competently mixes those elements is doing well. 


What feels completely wild, however, is this game from a mostly unknown company seemingly becoming a record-shattering hit overnight.


Palworld's official English-language Twitter account has just tweeted a thank you note for Steam users who made Palworld the game with more paid concurrent players out of any game in the history of the platform.




The numbers are amazing, but that's not quite accurate


Palworld, a game that came pretty much out of nowhere, did manage to beat huge company-backed juggernauts such as Cyberpunk 2077, Elden Ring, and even 2024's best-selling game. Yes, that one…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pocketpair, the devs behind the surprise record-obliterating Palworld, have just warned players about one specific bug that might seriously hinder their gameplay experience.


If you're familiar with the "Memory Reset Drug", which is used to reset character stats, take heed. The developers warn that there's a possibility that it can permanently reduce one's capture power. 


Screenshot from Pocketpair's Discord


Pocketpair says it's investigating this issue and advises players to refrain from, uh, doing drugs until they fix this issue. 


The developers don't specify exactly how much of your capture power will go down if this bug knocks on your door, but we have to assume your capture abilities will take a non-negligible hit. This sucks, especially if you've already committed to using these, but as far as release bugs go, it could've been much worse. 


Palworld has hit Steam and the Xbox Game Pass like a meteor — one of those from sci-fi tales that come full of wacky alien lifeforms. After not even 24 hours out, the Pokémon-inspired title was already doing numbers high to the point of dwarfing recent mega-hits such as Lethal Company. 


Some Pokémon fans have been pretty vocal in accusing Palworld of being nothing more than an edgy clone, but whether or not you care for it, I find it very hard to ignore all of the awesome — albeit sometimes questionable — things that this new title brings to the table.


As for this bug, it's completely natural for issues such as this to hit a game on launch, and it's expected that it'll get fixed soon. 


You can now capture cute animals and even human NPCs on Steam and the Xbox Game Pass.

With the power of time travel - and a flash-looking launch trailer - on its side, the indie hopeful certainly looks set to put up a decent fight when it exits Early Access in just over a month.

Oh, and we also try to guess the next game's subtitle. My money is on "Reloaded."

        <updated>2024-01-19T19:30:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For a game that's been repeatedly described as "Pokémon with machineguns", the first thing that strikes me about Palworld is just how un-Pokémon-like it actually is. To its credit, it does do quite a good Pokémon Legends: Arceus impression when you first step out on its big, Breath Of The Wild-style hilltop and take in the open world vista of its monster-stuffed starting continent. But if the opening moments of washing up on the island in nothing but your very scantily clad undies hadn't already given it away (seriously, why do shipwrecks always destroy the clothes you had on, but not your smalls underneath?), then the ream of tutorial prompts about punching trees to get more wood, building bases, putting pals to work on said bases, and the endless parade of crafting technologies you'll need to unlock to actually do anything on this godforsaken rock will quickly pull the wool clear away from your hopeful little face. 
For underneath the cute round eyes of its cover stars, Palworld is really a survival game wearing the dead skin suits of Game Freak's catch 'em all monster friends. In a lot of cases, those skin suits are quite literal, such are the blatant palette swaps and so-close-to-copyright-infringement-I-can't-believe-Nintendo's-lawyers-haven't-shut-this-down-years-ago rip-off creatures on display here. For that reason alone, Palworld can feel about as soulless and cynical as it comes. But that's not the worst of it. Even aside from all the survival gubbins, base building and sweatshop automation practices shoved down your throat, Palworld is just an awful example of monster-catching games in general. If it's a Pokémon game on PC you're after, go and play Cassette Beasts. Go and play Coromon, TemTem, or Monster Sanctuary. Anything but this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved. Archived episodes will be uploaded each Saturday on our second YouTube channel Game Informer Shows, which you can watch both above and by clicking the links below.

Pals can be used in battle or put to work, building structures and mining resources. You can also mow them down with guns. Yes, this game features realistic guns. It's a very strange but, thus far, entertaining experience.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It always breaks my heart a bit when a game I've been looking forward to for a while absolutely biffs it on arrival. Having quite enjoyed Golf Club Wasteland a few years ago (now called Golf Club Nostalgia for, I don't know, reasons), I was quite pumped when developers Demagog Studios announced not one, but two further games set in the same post-apocalyptic universe. The first to come out (albeit only on Netflix at the moment) was the turn-based strategy game Highwater (also a bit of a dud, based on the early Steam demo I played last year), but it's the second game, The Cub (out today on Steam) that has prompted this current moment of teeth-sucking sadness. 
I've been playing a bit of it over the last week, and oh man, it's trying so, so hard to be like Limbo and Inside, but just... doing quite a terrible job of it all. I was looking forward to any excuse I could get to have the soothing sounds of Golf Club's dystopian Radio Nostalgia From Mars show back in my ear drums, but alas. I simply cannot hear it over the sound of my own screams of frustration.

It's set to release in Q2 of this year, and there's a demo on Steam right now if you'd like to give it a try. Expect to make nice fortresses out of Lego-style bricks, then defend them from hordes of horrors. I'd say that's a recipe for a good time.

Even as a keen viewer of Leverage: Redemption, I was leery of the heist-o-rama tackling esports. And sure, its fake video game is baffling, but I was surprised by how many notes the esports episode hit right. With an Illumatrons team overworked to breaking point by an egotistical owner hawking dangerous supplements, it'll take a con, a frame, fisticuffs, and powerful cheat software to save the day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I disliked turn-based RPG Kingsvein at first. Quite a bit, in fact. An earlier version of this review would have been a very negative on, filled mostly with complaints and annoyances about opaque and frustrating systems, most of which I've since got over as the intent behind its design has become more clear.
It could definitely explain some things better, and its inscrutably tiny graphics remain a minor nuisance. But it's grown on me a lot, and though it may not be quite the kind of turn-based RPG I get on with best, it's an enjoyable one with a refreshing lack of bloat and timewasting, and with a class and combat system that will be pure catnip to a particular kind of player.

I don't hate it! But it's no Secrets Can Kill, and I think that's in part down to increased ambition, as our Nance is called upon to solve a poison pen puzzle at a TV studio.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Street Fighter 6 is getting its third DLC fighter in February, and the psycho-powered boxer Ed is next in line. 
Although Ed was first introduced in Street Fighter IV, he didn’t become a playable fighter until Street Fighter V (included in the Season 2 roster of characters). The protege of Balrog sports the same psycho powers that M. Bison wielded, but he thankfully isn’t an evil mastermind. That doesn't make him any less brutal, though, and you can watch him clear a subway car full of Mad Gear gang members in the cinematic trailer below. 


Ed joins Street Fighter 6 as the third fighter in the Year 1 character pass alongside the previously released Rashid and A.K.I. (leaving Akuma as the final Year 1 fighter) and will appear in the story-driven World Tour mode too.

Not that any of them could decide how to actually pronounce WASD when it came to talking about them on last night's Developer Update stream, though, as there were competing cries of "was-dee", "wased" and "double-you-ey-es-dee" all over the shop as they debated this clearly very "controversial topic" live on air. Read on for more details about what they're hoping to achieve with WASD controls in the game, but more importantly: how do you pronounce WASD? Let's get a poll up asap.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in the depths of 2023's February Steam Next Fest, Roots Of Yggdrasil was one of a handful of games that really caught my attention. Not because it was another beautiful-looking deckbuilder (though that does seem to be a steadily growing niche of mine these days), or because its colourful, inkwash visuals had the air of a Norse-flavoured Okami about them (though it did also help). Rather, it was the way its roguelike foundations meshed with its freeform, but still very goal-driven turn-based building systems, giving you drive and purpose in your construction choices, while also being light and chill, with just the right amount of existential threat nipping at your heels.
It struck me that if, say, my best puzzle strategy bud Dorfromantik was ever turned into a roguelike, this is probably a good approximation of what it would look and feel like, which is, frankly, yep, I'd like that game right now, please. Happily, with Roots Of Yggdrasil now approaching its early access launch on January 24th, I'm very happy to report that it's come on leaps and bounds since that Next Fest demo. This is already a very moreish and polished building game, and I've been struggling to tear myself away from it as I guide my longboat of magic Vikings away from their impending Ragnarok.

My Streak's brown switches became a bit loud and quite rattly, which, as someone with hearing declared by an audiologist to be so sensitive that I give myself tinnitus, started to get to me. 


So I type this to you now as someone who's graduated to Kailh low profile switches, which is proving as nutritious for my finger pads as I'd imagine its leafy homophone would be. Here's hoping that there's more low profile mechanical keebs out there in a few years, as the options seem very limited at the mo.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last summer, Sky TV obtained a somewhat mysterious pirate IPTV blocking injunction at the High Court in London. In the months up to November 2023, that led to UK ISPs blocking at least 400 IPTV domains/subdomains, potentially many more. Available data today suggests a perpetual war of attrition on an unprecedented scale. In the last four weeks alone, Sky blocked almost 4,200 IPTV service URLs; the pirates' response is simple: churn out more.

It’s a genre that has been gaining traction in recent years, but Ubisoft’s return to the Prince of Persia franchise is one of the best we’ve seen in a long time. It's even managed to make a spot for itself on our list of the Best Metroidvania Games you should make a point to play. 
The Lost Crown is also notable for the way it advances this game style with novel ideas and mechanics. While not everything on this list is brand new, these features combine to make Ubisoft’s new adventure one of the most rewarding, approachable, and satisfying releases in the genre, …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whether you call them Metroid-likes, exploration-based action platformers, big map adventures, or simply Metroidvanias, this sub-genre has exploded in popularity. What was once a criminally underused design template has become one of the most commonly used formats in games. That’s especially true for indie developers, who seem more than happy to make up for prolonged droughts between actual Metroid and Castlevania titles by concocting their own unique spins on the style. While some 3D games have adopted the formula to success (see: Batman: Arkham Asylum), this list will only highlight 2D-style titles for the sake of clarity. Here are 10 great modern Metroidvanias, in reverse chronological release order, that you’ll have a great time getting lost in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, during the most recent Xbox Developer Direct, Ara: History Untold, a new strategy game from Oxide Games, got a deep dive revealing gameplay and more. The game was first announced in 2022. 
Oxide talked up its "living world," a procedurally generated map for players to create the society they want in Ara. As the developers say, it will change over time based on players' decisions. You can watch the presentation starting at the 25:00 minute mark. 


Ara's Prestige System pits players to build a nation better than opponents'. The game's score system awards points based on what kind of leader a specific player wants to be. An example, as detailed during today's live stream, is building "Triumphs," or famous buildings throughout history that give large Prestige bonuses.
Oxide is a Maryland-based studio founded in 2013 by former Firaxis developers. Its previous games include 2016's Ashes of the Singularity and Star Swarm. 
Ara: History Untold is expected to be released on PC and PC Game Pass in the fall of this year. However, Oxide plans to keep its "Insider Program" after release, implementing player feedback.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During today's Xbox Developer Direct, Square Enix made a surprise appearance to pull back the curtains on Visions of Mana, the first new mainline game in the franchise in 15 years. Square Enix also revealed Visions of Mana will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC this summer.
Executive producer Masaru Oyamada discussed the franchise's history, noting there have been 17 entries across its 30 years of existence. He also points out that what is now the Mana series today actually began as Final Fantasy Adventure in 1991. 


Mana series creator Koichi Ishii also joined this segment of the show to discuss how he has supervised the team on its work and implementation of taking what were originally pixelated monsters and converting them into the 3D monsters players will fight in the game. 
Notably, Visions of Mana is the first Mana game coming to Xbox. Oyamada expressed Square Enix's excitement about this first for the series while diving deeper into its real-time action combat. This real-time action combat is what originally separated Final Fantasy Adventure from the Final Fantasy series, which was strictly turn-based at the time. 
Visions of Mana's combat continues to look great, as does its beautifully vibrant world. Unfortunately, there's still a few months to go until PlayStation, Xbox, and PC players can play it because it's due out sometime this summer. 

While waiting for its release, check out the Visions of Mana announcement trailer from The Game Awards 2023 last month.

Unlike the isometric styling of those titles, Avowed is a first-person adventure more in the vein of something like The Elder Scrolls, Fallout, or The Outer Worlds.
Today’s Xbox Developer Direct offered a deeper dive into several important aspects of the game, but the standout feature was an explanation of combat, which aims to be action-oriented but still tactically complex. Players are allowed to use customizable loadouts, including selecting different weapons or other tools for each hand. We saw combinations of swords, shields, wands, and spell usage, and pistols.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Ninja Theory appeared on Microsoft's Xbox Developer Direct stream to discuss its sequel, Senua's Saga: Hellblade II. The big news from the footage is the game finally has a release date: May 21. Microsoft also confirmed that the game will be a digital-only release.
The developer revealed it is in the final months of development and outlined some elements to expect from Hellblade II. Senua is not in as much fear of her voices as she was in the original game, but she is still a Celtic warrior who struggles with psychosis. Like the first game, Ninja Theory is working with professionals like Cambridge's Paul Fletcher to ensure Senua represents an accurate version of someone struggling with complex mental issues.


There are a number of new characters she will interact with. Some will appreciate her perspective and consider her an ally, but others will reject her and consider her an enemy. Like the original game, Hellblade II takes 10th century Iceland (which the developer visited for research), and she is fighting against Vikings who are enslaving her people. Ninja Theory is focused on making the game historically accurate but with an obvious layer of fantasy on top.
Combat has been overhauled for the sequel, with the game focusing on the fact that Senua is not a superhero. The goal of the combat is to make players feel like they barely survived each encounter, and the gameplay footage of the combat looks brutal.
Ninja Theory ended the stream saying it hopes to "craft life-changing art with game-changing tech." We will determine if the game lives up to that lofty goal on May 21.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think we're well into "milking the gimmick" territory for bodycam horror games now - last week's Digested may have been one giant snake too many - but Zoochosis does have the additional virtue of being heavily inspired by the cute doggy scene from The Thing. And also, perhaps, Five Nights At Freddy's.
In this latest, gruesome escapade from Sparky Marky developers Clapperheads, you are a zookeeper working the night shift. Your job, initially, is to feed the incarcerated animals and clean up after them while giving them an occasional pat on the nose. But Something Is Wrong. Giraffes aren't supposed to have that many legs, or mandibles. Kangaroos aren't supposed to stick to the ceiling, or have several sets of teeth.

But in 2023 alone, more than 10,000 developers and people in games-adjacent industries were laid off. Plus, the unchecked rise of A.I. continued, and Unity burned developers with its controversial new game engine policies, not to name a few other not-so-great parts about 2023 – it was a great year for games but one of the worst for those who make them. 
Now, just as 2024 has begun, the Game Developers Conference has released its 12th annual State of the Game Industry report. Its data was collected from 3000 developers surveyed back in October of last year…]]></summary>

Having tried the new RTX 4070 Super, though, it looks like Nvidia aren’t just redeeming the Super badge – they might just right the wrongs of the RTX 40 family as a whole.

The cooperative heist FPS got off to a right bumpy start when the ever-unpopular decision to only be playable if you're online collided with server issues that saw Starbreeze take the game down for a while. Since then, it has failed to rise above 'Mixed' review rating on Steam, not helped by Starbreeze releasing a £15 DLC pack when many players were unhappy with the game they'd just bought for £35.

The main reason being, it adds a new ecological hazard called Badwater, that doesn't only make your water bad, but your crops and beavers at risk of being bad. Still, there are plenty of new buildings to help you harness the power of the stanky water and errr, exercise halls for beavers to get their sweat on. I wouldn't recommend they rehydrate with the bad water, though.

The game is a thrilling adventure, with plenty of excellent combat, puzzle, and traversal challenges. Once you get far enough in the game, you’ll likely encounter one of the most challenging of them all; The Impossible Climb is a late-game platforming/traversal sidequest that demands careful timing, patience, and the use of nearly all the powers you’ve earned up to that point in the story. If you want to prove your mastery of The Lost Crown, it’s the sequence you’ll want to tackle.

It was an intelligent and somewhat loving take on a Zelda-y RPG - a small town hero gets a sword and goes on a rampage fighting some bosses - except the main character is a turnip. And also he tears up any paperwork handed to him. Turnip Boy Robs A Bank follows directly on from his Tax Evasion, and it's not quite as funny or as focused, but it's also an entirely different genre of game, and I have a huge amount respect for that.

This is a Mini ITX case which allows 360-degree access to the components therein, with space for a 240mm AiO or 155mm high air cooler, triple-slot graphics cards up to 330mm in length and seven fans in total. It's often as high as £94, but for a little while now it's been available for £70 - a great price that makes it well worth recommending to you, dear RPS reader.

Don't be put off by 'Core i3' either - this model is similar in speed to the last-gen Core i5 11600K and not too far behind the Core i7 10700K, such is the leap forward Intel made with its 12th-gen CPU architecture. Today this processor is even cheaper than normal too, with prices dropping to £88 at Ebuyer in the UK.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bethesda has announced The Elder Scrolls: Castles, a new mobile experience from the team behind Fallout Shelter.
Like Fallout Shelter, Castles is a management sim, with Bethesda stating in an X post that “you'll build your own dynasty where every day in our world is a year in the game's world. Citizens are born, they die, rulers change, and can be betrayed.” Players control their own castle over multiple generations of rulers, families, and subjects. Decision-making dictates how well your kingdom operates and how content your subjects are; unhappy citizens may plot to overthrow you. 
Your castle can be expanded with new rooms and items, plus workstations for underlings. It appears to feature a turn-based combat system with players equipping heroes with gear to battle enemies and gather resources to grow their kingdom. Though the game's App Store page states that it includes in-game purchases, it is unclear if Castles is free-to-play or not. 
The Elder Scrolls: Castles has soft-launched in the Philippines and will become available in other regions over the next few months. It is the third mobile game in the series, following The Elder Scrolls: Blades, a traditional RPG, in 2019 and The Elder Scrolls: Legends, a collectible card game, in 2017.]]></summary>

While subsequent launches and peripherals joined the mix in the succeeding years, the main pillar for that claim is the developer's steadfast support of the Rock Band platform through its aggressive downloadable content schedule. Today, however, the studio announced the end of Rock Band 4 downloadable content.
The news comes more than two years after Harmonix was acquired by Fortnite and Unreal Engine developer Epic Games. Epic has since leveraged the studio's expertise for a side game within Fortnite called Fortnite Festival, which utilizes gameplay similar to the Rock Band.

His broad takeaway is: that ain't it, chief. In a social media thread today, Vincke wrote that "it's going to be a lot harder to get good content if subscription becomes the dominant model and a select group gets to decide what goes to market and what not". He feels that "direct from developer to players is the way". As such you shouldn't expect Baldur's Gate 3, Divinity: Original Sin 2 or any other Larian RPGs to join the Game Pass bandwagon anytime soon.

I hadn't that expected that snark-off to be so one-sided but Morte's cussing taunt took 80% of the votes. You have to forgive Snarks for snapping at your finger one day, Gordon, they're just little critters. Onwards! This week, I ask you to choose between nostalgia and new styles, ya? What's better: playing on an old patch, or asymmetrical outfits?

In my bedroom, I have a drawer lovingly dubbed my "drawer of sentimentality." There's a hat signed by various members of my favorite bands of a 2010s Warped Tour, tickets to some of my favorite movies, sticks from my last year on drum line in high school, and cards. Birthday cards, Christmas cards, "just because" cards, ones I got for graduating high school, ones I got for graduating college – So. Many. Cards. I struggle to throw cards away with personal greetings. I struggle to throw out anything that means something to me, even more than a…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When cute crafting RPG Bandle Tale: A League Of Legends Story was first announced at the end of last year, I don't think I really appreciated the fact it was going to be the next game from the devs behind mortuary farming-me-do Graveyard Keeper. I keep turning this fact over in my head as I watch Lazy Bear Games' associate producer Vlada Redko play a portion of Bandle Tale over Discord for me, with creative director Nikita Kulaga and Riot Forge's creative director Rowan Parker telling me about what's happening onscreen in front of me. As Redko explores the whimsical, knitting-themed city of Bandle as one of League Of Legends' tiny fluffy Yordle creatures, it is, to put it lightly, quite the tonal shift from their previous work. But don't let its cute looks fool you.
This is a crafting RPG with a ferociously long set of skill trees to master, with 40-60 hours' worth of new abilities to learn, objects to construct, errands to run, friends to enlist and - crucially - parties to throw. For in the Bandle woods of Runeterra, life's problems are solved by having a good old fashioned boogie, including the rather urgent issue of fixing the world's portal network, which has collapsed in a mysterious accident. It may have a softer, fluffier-looking surface than Graveyard Keeper, but underneath it looks as though there's just as much to dig into here, so here's what I've learned so far ahead of its release on February 21st.

Developed by apparent Macbeth fans Walking Tree Games GmbH, and published by Starbreeze, it's a heavily horror-themed tribe management sim with a roguelike campaign loop, set in what the developers are calling the "Lovecraftian Stone Age", with flagrant disregard for my nerves. Does the Lovecraftian Stone Age feature any actual walking trees? We'll find out on February 22nd, when the game launches into early access.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I enjoy Games Done Quick, an organisation that raises money for charity (this year is the Prevent Cancer Foundation) by playing games at peak efficiency. If you've never watched it before, I recommend loading up the Twitch stream at about 1am and sort of gently dissociating while someone plays an 80s NES game you've never heard of. Speaking of, one of the headline acts for this year's stream - which is running through to this Sunday 21st - was Peanut Butter, a shiba inu trained to press buttons on command, "playing" a NES game that came out in 1985. Although Peanut Butter obeyed his training, some technical issues colluded to snatch a world best time from him - but he raised many thousands of dollars, so good for him.
Peanut Butter is the latest high tide line in the efforts to put more weird and difficult hurdles between you and the controls of games when speedrunning or streaming them. And I must ask: where next? A cat? A snapping turtle biting pressure sensors? A Grey parrot to play a game without any input from you at all? Where will this madness end!?

Along the way, you'll both fight deadly arcane constructs (fantasy robots), and enlist one called Ayuzhan as your Seneschal Companion. These machinations aren't just devilish, in other words. They are literal machinations, with all manner of automated foe awaiting beneath the deserts of Kehjistan.

Personally, I'm extremely pleased to see they've added a photo mode, for example, as I spent inordinate amounts of time making Lara do creepy side-eye smiles during inappropriate Shadow Of The Tomb Raider scenes. But I'm also heartened to see they've kept in the original tank controls as an optional extra, alongside a more modern control scheme to make them more approachable.

Technically, the game was soft-revealed in 2022 as Project TB and is a 4v4 and 5vr top-down competitive action game. The game follows a collection of factions trying to survive in a post-apocalyptic earth. The combat leans on a fast-paced system where players glide across the arena using acceleration and deceleration to their advantage as they engage in close-quarters combat. You will apparently be able to swap characters mid-battle, which will obviously affect strategies.

A demo will be available for the game during the next Steam Next Fest, which will include five different modes and seven playable characters. Right now the game is currently only confirmed for PC.]]></summary>

Now, just a little over a month since its release, Embark is set to release Update 1.5.0 and a new limited-time mode, Solo Bank It, tomorrow, January 17. 
Embark calls this mode an "experimental" one, pitting 12 single players against each other in PvP matches. The first to obtain a total of 40,000 "Cash wins" takes home the win in Solo Bank It. Similar to standard Bank It, which is already in The Finals, contestants earn Cash by collecting and depositing Coins that drop from eliminated players; Coins can also be found in vaults around the map. 
Watch The Finals Update 1.5.0 trailer for yourself below: 


Elsewhere in this update, Embark is fixing plenty of bugs and making balance changes as well. Plus, Update 1.5.0 "comes with a security update to anti-cheat and fair play" and a store update, too. 
Update 1.5.0 and Solo Bank It go live in The Finals tomorrow, January 17.

It did so with a quick teaser trailer revealing that it's "coming soon." Its announcement coincides with 2024's first Grand Slam tennis tournament, the Australian Open, which began Saturday, January 13. 
"Today, 2K revealed the return of TopSpin with the teaser trailer for TopSpin 2K25, the next must-play sports game from 2K that fully immerses fans into the world of tennis," a press release reads. It also notes more information about the game is "to come." 
Watch the TopSpin 2K25 announcement teaser for yourself below: 


2K did not reveal a release date or a release window, but given that "25" is in the title, it's likely releasing either this year or the next. The last TopSpin game was released in 2011 with Top Spin 4 during the Xbox 360/PlayStation 3 generation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Grand Theft Auto V developer Rockstar Games and Alan Wake 2 studio Remedy Entertainment have a history that goes back years, namely due to the two's work on the Max Payne series. However, the companies are at the center of two trademark disputes filed by Rockstar's parent company, Take-Two Interactive, as first reported by RespawnFirst. In the disputes, Take-Two takes issue with Remedy's new logo it unveiled in April of last year, which features a stylized "R," claiming it's too similar to Rockstar's own "R" logo. 
The trademark disputes – here and here – were filed in the United Kingdom, and Take-Two, based in New York, is named as the "opponent" in it. The disputes were filed on May 11, 2023, which is a month after Remedy unveiled its new logo. 
Notably, despite the trademark dispute, Rockstar and Remedy are working together on a remake package of Max Payne 1 and 2. In October of last year, Remedy said the Max Payne 1 & 2 remake, which is a single game, has "progressed into a production readiness stage."
While waiting to learn more about this trademark conflict, read Game Informer's review of Alan Wake 2, and then watch the official trailer for Grand Theft Auto VI, which Rockstar plans to release in 2025.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/01/16/world-war-2-horror-game-martha-is-dead-is-getting-a-movie"/>
        <updated>2024-01-16T17:22:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The 2022 World War II horror game Martha is Dead is the latest video game getting a film adaptation. The game’s Italian developer LKA, is partnering with production company Studios Extraordinares to bring the psychological adventure to the big screen.
Martha is Dead is a first-person adventure that follows identical twin sisters, Guilia, the protagonist, and Martha. Set in Tuscany in 1944, during the final stretch of World War II, the sisters are fathered by a Nazi general and have a strained relationship due to the clear favoritism Martha receives from their mother. However, Martha is suddenly found dead, and their mother mistakenly believes Guilia to be Martha, forcing her to assume her late sister’s identity. Supernatural occurrences abound centering on the malevolent entity known as the White Lady.
The film follows the same premise. Studios Extraordinares is led by screenwriter/directors André Hedetoft and Andreas Troedsson, and the company’s website states it’s a “creative powerhouse writing and making high-end action, horror, and science-fiction films from original stories and extraordinary games.” The studio is also working on bringing last year’s sci-fi horror game Fort Solis to TV and film, as well as a movie adaptation of the upcoming horror shooter Veil. 
We didn’t particularly enjoy what Martha is Dead had to offer as a gameplay experience. In his review, editor Wesley LeBlanc scored the experience a 6 out of 10, writing, “LKA’s love of Italy is the only warmth I felt in Martha is Dead. The rest left me feeling as cold as Giulia’s dead sister.” Given the recent success of video game films like The Super Mario Bros. Movie and Five Nights at Freddy's, here’s hoping Martha is Dead can achieve even a fraction of that success. Or, at the very least, we hope it makes for a better movie than a video game.]]></summary>

The studio announced this release date in a quick trailer released today, which also calls September 5 the "final release date," indicating GSC Game World is confident it won't be delaying its long-awaited shooter any longer. The game was set to release in the first quarter of 2024 before today's delay.
Check out the Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl final release date announcement trailer for yourself below: 


Officially confirmed in 2020, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl has taken some time to get off the ground after various starts and stops. Then, following what appeared to be smoother development, the team paused its work in February 2022 due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, where GSC Game World is based. Employees were forced to evacuate their homes in places like Kyiv, which is Ukraine's capital. Some employees even volunteered to fight for Ukraine – developer Vladimir "Fresh" Yezhov was killed in combat in 2022, as reported by GameRant.
In December 2022, GSC Game World returned with a new S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 gameplay trailer, and we've been waiting on the game ever since. It was set to launch in 2023 before it was delayed to Q1 of this year, and now we know it's coming to Xbox Series X/S and PC on September 5.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer 11 Bit Studio has unveiled the first full look at Frostpunk 2 gameplay. First announced in August 2021, the sequel to the bleak yet popular city-builder is also coming to Xbox and PC Game Pass.
The trailer provides a look at how decision-making appears in-game. The demands you’ll receive from your citizens appear to be as stressful as the first Frostpunk, as you control a Steward overseeing life in a city situated in an unforgiving tundra where resources are precious and everyone has their own ideas about how society should function. How do you ensure everyone gets fed? What does the education system look like? How do you keep the streets clean of literal and criminal filth? Set 30 years after the original game, citizens can vote to pass laws, and these decisions steer the city’s direction toward multiple outcomes and finales.


11 Bit also announced that Frostpunk 2 is launching on PC Game Pass, alongside Steam, The Epic Store, and GOG, in the first half of 2024. The game will also come to Game Pass on Xbox Series X/S at a later date and is targeting PlayStation 5 as well.

I still agree with that score today, too.
If I wrote what I want to say about The Last of Us Part II's story, I'm sure you'd find it very familiar because it's largely how I felt around the game's original release. Instead, my wife, Gabriella LeBlanc, played through The Last of Us Part II Remastered's story for the first time ever, mostly unspoiled of the adventure, and it was awesome listening to her thoughts in real-time about the game.

For those subscribers looking to add it to their library, or for non-subscribers looking to purchase the game outright, Foamstars launches exclusively on PlayStation 4 and 5 on February 6.


As for the game itself, Foamstars is a 4 vs. 4 online multiplayer game where players take on the role of the titular Fomastars of varying classes and abilities to participate in a game called Foamsmash. Rather than simply shooting your opponent, the goal is to coat them with enough foam so that you can slide-kick them to knock them out of the match. The foam also changes the layout of the arena by creating traversable hills and defensive walls, and you can move through your own foam faste…]]></summary>

Ever since I got my hands on Persona 3 Reload over the summer, I've described it to folks as "Persona 3 redone in the form of Persona 5 Royal." While that may be a gross oversimplification, it's also pretty high praise. Longtime fans of the Persona series point towards Persona 3 as the entry that changed the course of the series, pointing it down the path it's been on for nearly the last two decades. While Persona 3 may be the most important entry from a mechanical perspective, Persona 5 has the most mainstream relevance, particularly in 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In February 2022, former designers from CD Projekt Red announced the formation of a new studio called Rebel Wolves. The team revealed its first project would be, unsurprisingly, an RPG, and today, we learned a couple more details about the game, including its title.
The game is called Dawnwalker, and Rebel Wolves describes it as a “story-driven dark fantasy role-playing adventure.” Billed as being the team's dream RPG project, the game has officially entered the alpha stage of development, and Rebel Wolves plans to share more information about it later this year. 
The studio also announced another CD Projekt alumni Mateusz Tomaszkiewicz as the game’s creative director. Tomaszkiewicz work includes Cyberpunk 2077, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, and Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales.
“We want to craft a world that you will want to explore and dive deep into and tell stories that make you care about the characters,” said Tomaszkiewicz in a press release. “We aim to deliver an experience that will allow for a variety of choices and room for experimentation when replayed. Helping craft this experience with so many talented people will be my mission at Rebel Wolves, and I can't wait for everyone to see what the team has been up to for quite a while now.”
Rebel Wolves didn’t share any more info on Dawnwalker, so questions about its premise, narrative, mechanics, and platforms will go unanswered until hopefully later this year. Until then, the team did release a piece of promotional art, posted above, that should help fuel imaginations of what the team is cooking.]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-01-15T17:34:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bandai Namco has released Tekken 8’s opening cinematic to whet fans' appetite for the game as its release date draws ever closer. The publisher also confirmed that long-time favorite Eddy Gordo will kick off the roster of Season 1 DLC fighters.
The intro cinematic is impressively rendered and, in true Tekken fashion, utterly absurd. In addition to seeing the main cast throwdown with implausible displays of martial arts, we even see them engage in a full-on battle reminiscent of the Wakanda fight in Avengers: Infinity War. 


The video concludes with the reveal that Eddy Gordo is joining the roster this spring. Since his first appearance in Tekken 3, Eddy has been both beloved and reviled for his extremely effective use of Capoeira, so we're excited to see new tricks he has up his sleeves. 
In a neat behind-the-scenes twist, the trailer shows off some of the motion capture and animation that went into bringing Eddy into the current generation of Tekken. Eddy is the first of four characters that will be added to Tekken 8 throughout the year for purchasers of the Year 1 Season Pass or owners of the Deluxe, Ultimate, or Collector's Editions of the game in which the pass is included.
Tekken 8 launches on January 26 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. You can read our impressions of the game’s Story mode and Arcade mode here.]]></summary>

The game's logic was all hardcoded, so we really need people to try all sorts of weird actions, and make sure the game handles everything correctly and matches the original implementation.
