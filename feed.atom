Coming off the back of the ice cream-themed event from a few weeks ago, Nintendo has today announced that Splatoon 3's next Splatfest will be getting underway next month — running from 12th-14th August, to be precise.
Away from the bright colours of ice cream or battles for the Triforce, the upcoming event takes a much more personal turn, asking the question "Which is the most important to you?" The three different teams on offer this time are Money, Fame and Love, but which will come out on top?

While it wasn’t the first, and most of its mechanics were accomplished previously by Technos’ own Renegade in 1986, Double Dragon’s popularity both in arcades and through its home ports established the success of the formula. It has been cemented in the annals of game history (or however that saying is supposed to go).
Because of this, the series has never really died, even after the original developers, Technos, went bust. However, since 1995, it’s largely been remakes...or worse. In 2012, there was WayForward’s excellent Double Dragon Neon, but that kind of stands apart from lesser attempts to revive the series.

When violence is the core vice of most video games, and in the case of Mortal Kombat, viscerally so, it’s worth exploring how it translates to sensory player feedback. Double Dragon Gaiden works well in terms of negotiating increasingly difficult enemy gangs with creative use of your expanding moveset, and, while the series' signature knee-to-nose routine is still here, it isn’t carried off with the hard edge it once was.
Developed by Secret Base, and hailing out of Singapore, the team has added plenty of nuance to the belt-scrolling formula. Now, you choose two of four initial characters (with a generous nine more available for unlocking) and have the ability to tag between them as long as your super gauge is full. If one character is taking excessive damage, or has better range for certain sections, just switch them out. Likewise, if one of your duo desperately needs a health item, you can keep them safely in the background until one turns up.

Double Dragon may be one of the original pillars of the beat ‘em up genre, but that foundation has weakened in modern times. Infrequent sequels of varying quality have tested Jimmy and Billy Lee’s modern relevance, but Double Dragon Gaiden does a solid job of reinventing the pair with a neat tag team mechanic. Though as enjoyable as this contemporary throwback can be, it often gets in its own way with frustrating combat design.

Starting today, The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages and The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons are now available for the Nintendo Switch Online service. Like with other classic Game Boy and Game Boy Color titles, you only need the standard NSO subscription to access these two bizarre and wonderful games.
If you missed out on the Oracle titles, the games are the product of a developer known as Flagship, which released several high-profile titles and ports between 1998 and 2006. It developed four Zelda games for portable consoles during that time, including the original Four Swords and Minish Cap.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Subscribers to Nintendo Switch Online can now access two of the most beloved Game Boy Color games of all time. The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages and The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons join the roster of playable classic games as part of the Nintendo Switch Online's Game Boy catalog. 
As was true with the original Game Boy Color cartridges, you can experience the games on their own in any order that you wish, but if you link them together through a password system, some characters and enemies will change, some items can be upgraded, and you can take part in the climactic final battle. It's also worth noting that these games served as Hidemaro Fujibayashi's directorial debut within the Legend of Zelda franchise. Fujibayashi would go on to direct The Minish Cap, Skyward Sword, Breath of the Wild, and Tears of the Kingdom.
The Nintendo Switch has steadily become one of the best places to experience the Legend of Zelda series. From Switch releases like Breath of the Wild, Tears of the Kingdom, and the Link's Awakening remake to nearly every classic Zelda game available through Nintendo Switch Online and its Expansion Pack, Zelda fans can enjoy nearly every beloved mainline entry – though Wind Waker and Twilight Princess remain conspicuously absent. However, with the Oracle games now available, fans of Link and his adventures have two more easy-to-access adventures on Nintendo's massively successful hybrid system.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We know that Larian Studios' upcoming Baldur's Gate 3 is a big game. With the story-driven RPG releasing on August 3—a Thursday—how does anyone expect you to wait until the weekend? At that point, you may as well take off until Friday so you can have four full days to explore the Sword Coast.
As a service to players, Larian had their legal team draft up a special leave form. To be precise, the form is a request for Special Dispensation for the aptly titled Baldur's Day. As Larian says, just give the note to your boss—they'll understand. All we need now is a disclosure form to give to our partner explaining why they might not see us for a few days while we're glued to our PC.
As the form says, this isn't our choice, but rather fate calling.
"I, the undersigned, hereby request a Special Dispensation from my regular duties and obligations in observance of the momentous occasion of the release of Baldur's Gate 3 ("Baldur's Day"). As fate would have it, I am compelled to answer a calling to gather my party and embark on an epic adventure."

There are definitely worse reasons to miss work, right?

The release date shuffle
Don't forget that Larian recently announced they were moving up the PC release date of Baldur's Gate 3 by almost a month. Early September was looking pretty congested, especially with the release of Starfield on September 6.
Summerfall Studios followed up by pushing the release of their musical RPG Stray Gods back by one week. As our own Eric Van Allen pointed out, an extra week can be a silver lining for last-minute polish. Especially when Stray Gods ls launching on PC, Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch all on the same day.
Baldur's Gate 3 releases on PC on August 3. PlayStation 5 players will have to wait just a little longer when BG3 releases on September 6.

Headcannon continued working with the Sonic brand through 2022's Sonic Origins and its 2023 update Sonic Origins Plus, while Whitehead founded his own studio, Evening Star, alongside fellow Sonic Mania developers in 2018.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new Belmont takes up the whip and mantle for the animated Castlevania series soon. Powerhouse Animation Studios has announced that Castlevania: Nocturne will have its Netflix premiere on September 28.
A teaser image was posted from the Castlevania Twitter account earlier today, with the confirmed date. There's another news beat on the way too, as a trailer for Castlevania: Nocturne will arrive on July 27.
https://twitter.com/Castlevania/status/1684217339036725250
Nocturne will follow Richter Belmont, the lead in Castlevania: Rondo of Blood who also appears in several other games. We don't know too much more at this point, but the forthcoming trailer will probably illuminate what's at stake. (Hold for applause.)
The original Castlevania run from Powerhouse followed Trevor Belmont, Sypha Belnades, and Alucard in a loose adaptation of Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse. It soon veered off into its own story, tying in plot beats from Castlevania history ranging all the way to 2005's Curse of Darkness. And it was, in my humble opinion, a pretty damn good series. The castle entrance fight in Season 2 is still an all-timer for me.
Streaming at large
Of course, this series arrives during a tumultuous time for streaming in general. Both the Writers Guild of America (WGA) and Screen Actors Guild (SAG-AFTRA) are currently on strike over, among other complaints, disputes with streaming companies. Animated work is part of this issue too, as late night host Stephen Colbert recently noted at a WGA animation rally.
Neither the WGA nor SAG-AFTRA have called for a boycott at this time, so it doesn't seem to affect Castlevania: Nocturne. But it's an issue worth looking into and learning about. A lot of creative talent goes into making shows like these. It's frankly amazing we get adaptations like Castlevania these days.

Homeworld Remastered Edition 
Homeworld 2 Remastered Edition 
The Homeworld Remastered Multiplayer Beta (including cross-store play between Epic and Steam users)

A fun tactical Sci-fi RTS epic
If you haven't had the chance to play Homeworld, this is a great opportunity to do so. It's a very formidable entry in the RTS genre with over 100 unique spaceships and more than 30 single-player missions. Those interested in multiplayer can also access the improved Homeworld Remastered Multiplayer beta. This new version of the multiplayer mixes the two, so Homeworld races can compete against Homeworld 2 races with up to eight players on 23 maps. Furthermore, the new multiplayer includes brand-new game modes.
Gearbox recently delayed Homeworld 3 to February 2024, so you have plenty of time to catch up on the series before it releases.
If you're interested in grabbing Homeworld Remastered Collection for free, simply head to its listing between July 27 and August 3 on the Epic Games Store. You will be able to add the game to your library and download it right away.

        <updated>2023-07-26T20:00:50.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft has reportedly cancelled its plans for an Immortals Fenyx Rising sequel. Multiple sources anonymously told VGC that a follow-up was in early development at Ubisoft Quebec, but leadership ultimately decided to cancel it.
Kotaku has also corroborated the report. Ubisoft has commented on VGC's original reporting, saying it's "reallocating some creative teams and resources within the Quebec studio."
“As part of our global strategy, we are redirecting and reallocating some creative teams and resources within the Quebec studio to other unannounced projects," the company told VGC. "The expertise and technologies these teams developed will serve as an accelerator for the development of these key projects focused on our biggest brands. We have nothing further to share at this time."
Fading into myth
Ubisoft's Breath Of The Wild-inspired title from 2020 was good, and found moderate success among players. Still, VGC's sources claim that Ubisoft canceled the Immortals sequel over perceived challenges around establishing the IP.
Ubisoft's original plan revolved around turning Immortals into a franchise that would explore various mythologies. The original game and its DLC explored the Greek and Chinese mythologies, respectively. Journalist Jeff Grubb reported last year that Ubisoft intended to explore things such as Hawaiian Polynesian myths in the future, but that won't be happening anymore.
Immortals is Ubisoft's fourth known cancellation this year. It follows the axing of three unannounced games as the company shifts focus to its best-selling IPs. To give you an idea of how closely Ubisoft is sticking to their bigger properties, this year's Assassin's Creed Mirage is but one of at least six games in the series currently in development.
This casts yet another large shadow over the fates of upcoming titles such as Skull & Bones and the poster child of development hell itself, Beyond Good & Evil 2.

Currently "in development," the manager would serve as a link between Splatoon 3 itself and the SplatNet 3 app, which will allow tournament organizers (TOs) to create and control their own tournaments, which includes bracket creation (!), and the automatic creation of lobbies, as well as automatic reporting (cutting down on a lot of the administrative work running tou…]]></summary>

Intel's AVX10 announcement noted initial support with Granite Rapids processors that will debut next year but no mention of the E-core-only Sierra Forest. With the AVX10 only coming to P/E core client processors after Granite Rapids, it would appear the high density Sierra Forest generation will miss out on AVX10/AVX-512 and not appear until Clearwater Forest.

The League of Legends company showed off more footage of its in-development fighting game Project L today with the reveal of Duo Play, a co-op option for the tag-team fighting game.
Project L is a two-on-two tag fighter, similar to games like BlazBlue Cross Tag Battle. This means each side fields two characters, picked out of the League of Legends universe of Runeterra, for its matches.
While you'd normally pilot these teams solo, Project L is also offering Duos, which lets two players team up and each handle an individual fighter. It basically turns Project L into a co-op tag fighter, where you can combo off each other, throw out assists, and tag in and out.

The other two additions for this month are digital playground Dreams and Action-Adventure RPG Death's Door.
While these new entries certainly won't change anyone's mind on the quality of the service, Dreams and Death's Door are both great and PGA Tour 2K23 isn't a bad add for the sports fans out there.

While delays are never fun, it's always understandable when it's ensuring game quality. Based on the recent Sea of Thieves official podcast episode, it sounds like some heavy-hitting new systems are coming to the pirate adventure:
"As we assess the ongoing development of Season 10, looking at the work we've got remaining, and the expectation that there will still be unforeseen issues that will crop up," said Creative Director Mike Chapman. "And even though the team is working incredibly hard to pull this ambitious feature set together, ultimately we're not where we want to be in the development timeframe. So we've taken the difficult decision to delay Season 10 to October 19. This has been an incredibly hard decision for us to make on the Sea of Thieves. It's a very difficult thing for us to do with the plans that we had, but this is right for us. Especially for the ambitions that we had for Season 10."

Season 10 appears to be full of new content
Rare typically doesn't disclose SoT features ahead of time but this is shaping up to be a big update.
Typically each season comes with one headline content feature. However, with the new timeframe, the plan is for two headliner features in the first two months of Season 10. The team explains that while things may feel slow right now, Season 10 should re-energize the SoT world with multiple feature releases, events, and experiences.
Sea of Thieves Season 10 is scheduled to release October 19 on PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.

The second part of the Final Fantasy 35th Anniversary Special Interview has been shared today on the official Final Fantasy YouTube, and this nostalgia-filled interview focuses on the Super Famicom / SNES trilogy that was recently rereleased in the Pixel Remaster series on Switch — Final Fantasy IV, V, and VI.
Hosted once again by Final Fantasy fan, voice actor, and announcer Matsuzawa Chikai, this chat follows Part 1's discussion a few weeks ago. Returning to discuss the series' legacy is the creator of Final Fantasy Hironobu Sakaguchi, pixel artist and video game artist Kazuko Shibuya, and current Final Fantasy brand manager Yoshinori Kitase, the latter of whom joined Square in 1991 and began work on Final Fantasy Adventure — or Seiken Densetsu, the first Mana game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in the '90s, id Software was the gaming company, responsible for bringing the world Doom and Quake. Two of the founding members of that company were John Carmack and John Romero, both now considered giants in their field.
However, since Romero's departure from id in 1996 (post-Quake 1), the two Johns have never come together to work on another project. And if you were hoping they would reform and create something together, Carmack has pretty much shot that idea down.
https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1683542191350661120
In a post on his Twitter page recently, the former Doom developer praised Romero on the recent publication of his autobiography Doom Guy: A Life in First Person. Carmack then pre-empted an inevitable question about whether the two programmers would make anything together again.
And never the Johns shall meet
Unfortunately, the answer is no. He pretty much spells it out in black and white: "we aren’t planning to make a new game together." It's said in a good-natured way, though, and there doesn't appear to be any bad blood between the two.
It's possible that many were hopeful that something Doom-esque (or anything from the two legendary developers) would eventually come to fruition, thanks to a recent Reddit AMA from Romero.
In response to one question, Romero says the pair "could have stayed working together if we did things differently at the start of Quake." He also added that he and Carmack have talked about options, which features in his book.
John Romero is still active in the development world (it looks like he's in talks for a new FPS through a major publisher). Conversely, John Carmack has pretty much left video game creation behind, having been a major player at Oculus VR up until 2022, and now works on AGI—artificial general intelligence—under Keen Technologies.

Devolver Digital has today given us another look at The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood, a witch-filled narrative experience which we now know will be materialising on Switch on 16th August.
The game comes from Spanish developers Deconstructeam — the team behind 2019's great cyberpunk tale The Red Strings Club — and will see you taking on the role of Fortuna, an exiled witch who takes her Tarot card-reading powers into her own hands in an attempt to regain her freedom. Creating your own deck of divination cards and using them to investigate your fellow witches' lives, you will guide Fortuna through a heartfelt story that looks to tackle some pretty heavy themes.

        <updated>2023-07-26T16:19:46.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The studio behind The Witcher and Cyberpunk video game series is parting ways with a chunk of its staff. CD Projekt Red is laying off around 100 workers, which it estimates is roughly 9% of the entire team.
As announced in a letter shared on CD Projekt's site from CEO Adam Kiciński, the layoffs will run up through Q1 2024. Its announced the layoffs now in the "spirit of transparency" and to give team members a chance to process. Additionally, CD Projekt assures that those affected have been offered a "comprehensive" severance package.
The reasoning behind these layoffs is CD Projekt Red's new direction, it seems. Kiciński writes that CDPR has reshaped its development process and incorporated Agile methodologies, and is now turning its eye towards staff.
"We’ve carefully assessed all teams in the company in terms of their expected contribution to the delivery of our strategy," said Kiciński. "There’s no easy way to say this, but today we are overstaffed. We have talented people on board who are finishing their tasks and—based on current and expected project needs—we already know we don’t have other opportunities for them in the next year."
The future of CD Projekt Red
CD Projekt has quite a few projects in development, as the letter notes. There are new Cyberpunk and Witcher games in the works. Plus, CD Projekt is also working on a new franchise, under the codename Hadar. All that, plus the impending release of Cyberpunk 2077's first and only big DLC expansion, Phantom Liberty, in September.
With all these games in the works, it's a little strange to see a cut like this. Especially since CD Projekt also made fairly recent cuts on other projects, like Gwent and Molasses Flood's Witcher spin-off. Hopefully, those affected can land on their feet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ideally, the story of Remnant II’s launch would start and end with it being an ambitious success of a shooty Soulslike. Sadly not: in a Reddit post addressing complaints of wonky performance, even on higher-end graphics cards, developers Gunfire Games admitted to having "designed the game with upscaling in mind." 
Working the likes of Nvidia DLSS, AMD FSR, and Intel XeSS into a game wouldn’t normally be a cause of incredulity. Indeed, as optional performance boosters, they’re pretty much always a welcome sight amid the duller texture filtering and ambient occlusion toggles of the average settings menu. The problem here is that with its dismal performance at native, non-upscaled resolutions, Remnant II essentially forgets about the 'optional' part – and in doing so, undermines what makes DLSS and its rivals such valuable tools in the first place.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's nothing quite like a new take on a classic game, and Resident Evil 4 should be no exception. We've already encountered enough mods for the remake, so it's nice to see the 2005 version of Resident Evil 4 still getting some love in 2D form.
This one comes courtesy of DooMero over on Doomworld (spotted by PCGamesN), and is essentially a sort-of "demake" of Resident Evil 4 which turns the third-person horror title into a 2D shooter.
https://youtu.be/pJcanNT5iQg
A recent video uploaded to the modder's YouTube channel shows 30-minutes of action from the project. Indeed, we get to see Leon Kennedy, as he was in the original RE4, making his way through the village in glorious side-scrolling action. The twist here is that it's being created in the Doom engine; GZDoom to be precise.
So when do we get to play it?
At the moment, there doesn't appear to be any release date for what's being called Resident Evil 4 2D. DooMero says they've been working on the mod since 2016, but had to take a break. All we can really say is that a demo is hopefully coming soon. We just don't know when.
It's pretty impressive to see something like RE4 being recreated in Doom. It kind of goes to show just how versatile the latter continues to be, not to mention how creative the modding community can get.
It's a bit of a new take on what many would consider to be the best Resident Evil game ever. Admittedly, going to 2D side-scrolling does give it an antiquated kind of charm, but it's just one more way we can admire Leon's golden bangs.

Patrick's Parabox is the kind of game you have to play to truly understand. This brain-bending puzzler deftly reinvents itself dozens of times over without deviating from its very simple, programmatic rules revolving around infinitude and recursion.
Chances are, you've heard of this premise before: push an object around a grid-like playing field and try to figure out how to navigate obstacles. Think along the lines of the puzzles you'd find in an icy cave in a Pokémon game. You have to plan every single move just right to get yourself, a box, or both, into the right spots. Chances are just as high, however, that you haven't seen the Patrick's Parabox's take on this puzzle. Instead of just pushing around a box to solve a puzzle, the game tasks you with navigating infinitely recurring boxes while also pushing boxes into place.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Under the new rights holders Studio 2.21, cult classic series Little Big Adventure was set to make a comeback after three decades off-grid, with original creator Didier Chanfray attached to the projects. The comeback plans included an all-new reboot, plus remasters for the two 1990s action-adventure games. But today, the studio announced that they were “unsuccessful in securing a publisher,” which has led to the reboot’s cancellation and layoffs at the developer.


“Despite our earnest efforts,” CEO Ben Limare wrote in a blog post, “we were unsuccessful in securing a publisher for the reboot of Twinsen’s Little Big Adventure.” According to Limare, the reasons for this are threefold: genre appeal, the series’ limited recognition, and the planned costs. “Despite a passionate, albeit small, community of fans, Twinsen’s Little Big Adventure isn’t globally recognized, which added to the hesitations of potential publishers,” wrote Limare.


“While indie game studios can often deliver remarkable games with lean teams (as we've seen with Death’s Door and Tunic), our vision for this project involved a team of 15 to 20 people, echoing the original game's size,” he continued. “This considerable investment, juxtaposed with the risk inherent to the genre and IP, was a factor in the decision.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m guessing there’s an unwritten and unbreakable commandment that states every 2023 game must release next month. As evidence, the action RPG slasher Wayfinder is entering early access on August 15th. The game has some faint MMO flavours and comes from developers Airship Syndicate (the studio behind Darksiders: Genesis and Battle Chaser: Nightwar) and publisher Digital Extremes (responsible for the long-running Warframe.) The game previously held various closed playtests, but now the metaphorical doors are being opened for more players.

I’m not sure I agree with the iconic murder clown. I’m watching the first teaser for Peacock’s Twisted Metal, and while I wasn’t sure what to expect from an adaptation of one of my favorite childhood franchises, whatever hopes I had fell away watching this strange out-of-context clip. Sweet Tooth dancing to and singing the lyrics to Sisqó’s “Thong Song?” Showing a comedic fistfight instead of vehicles blowing each other up? I know the showrunners are aiming for laughs, but what have they done to my game?
After watching the show’s first season, I must confess: I really like Twisted Metal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Given that it was one of the most popular shows on TV back in its prime, it's not surprising there have been a number of video game adaptations of The Simpsons.
Some have been less than impactful, while others have been downright abysmal. However, one that tends to get mentioned (even these days) is Simpsons: Hit & Run, the collective of open world adventures of the titular yellow characters that parodied the likes of GTA.
https://youtu.be/AHAY-teQoFc
Now, it's made a comeback. Sort of. That is to say that someone has managed to remake Hit & Run entirely in Unreal Engine 5. Taking a year to complete, developer reubs has now finally managed to do a full recreation from scratch of the iconic 2003 Simpsons game.
Not for public consumption
Sadly, reubs says he won't be making his UE5 version available for all to play, stating clearly that this is not a downloadable mod. However, we do get to see the first 30-minutes of this unofficial remake.
There's plenty of content that the developer goes through, showing us the new graphics (with artwork done by technical artist korylonplay) and the new cutscenes. It still has that Simpsons: Hit & Run charm that Radical Entertainment gave us 20 years ago. It just looks more up-to-date.
For those who remember playing the original, it's a little trip down memory lane. Okay, so we can't play it, which kind of sucks, but you can imagine the litigation that would have to be traversed to get a remake approved by Disney (which now owns the franchise).
Simpsons writer and joint showrunner Matt Selman has expressed interest in seeing the game get remade, but describes the "complicated corporate octopus to try to make that happen." Given that, reubs' proof-of-concept is probably the closest we'll ever get to a modern take on Hit & Run.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the last few years, Sony has been steadily porting its hit AAA titles to PC. Though most ports, such as God of War (2018) and Horizon Forbidden West, have been successful, others, like The Last of Us Part 1, have been poorly received. Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is the next title up for a PC port, and Insomniac has confirmed that it is Steam Deck Verified.

Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart hits PCs
Rift Apart was initially released in 2021 as one of the PS5's flagship titles. It caught the attention of PlayStation players worldwide thanks to its dimensional rifts that allow players to jump between environments instantly.
PC players will get to experience Ratchet and Rivet's adventure soon, as the game is set to launch on the platform on 26 July. Initially, many believed that the port would require a beefy PC with a zippy SSD. Though you will need a reasonably specced PC to play Rift Apart, it will run just fine on hard disc drives (HDDs) at minimum settings.
https://twitter.com/insomniacgames/status/1683953133825716224
Rift Apart is Steam Deck Verified, meaning the portable gaming device can handle it. Though some variations of the Steam Deck have SSDs, players have to settle for lowered settings on the handheld, as has been the case with previous Sony ports. Those on high-spec PCs get to enjoy 4K 60FPS ray-traced gameplay.
This isn't the first time Insomniac has ported its titles to PC, as Spider-Man Remastered was ported to PC in 2022 (with help from fellow first-party studio Nixxes Software). The web-slinging game is also Steam Deck Verified.
Rift Apart is a visually stunning title that does a phenomenal job of presenting a truly next-gen experience. Though some may feel that it is a little pricey for its short length, it is packed with non-stop excitement.

It has been a long old time since the release of the original Simon the Sorcerer on PC — 30 years to be precise — and developer Smallthing Studios are marking the occasion by bringing the series back. Publisher Leonardo Interactive has today announced that the fantasy point-and-click series will be making a comeback on Switch in 2024 with the all-new title, Simon the Sorcerer Origins.
We first caught wind of this one back in May 2022, though today's announcement of a release next year is all new. The fresh teaser trailer (above) showcases some more of the game's Monkey Island-esque hand-drawn visuals, which the publishers note still carries all the original series' charm.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Capcom is one of the giants in the gaming industry, and it earned its reputation through its stable of hit franchises. This year has been a good one for the company, with titles such as Resident Evil 4 Remake and Street Fighter 6 releasing to critical acclaim. Capcom’s most recent quarterly report revealed the company’s bestselling franchises, and there aren’t many surprises.
[caption id="attachment_393594" align="alignnone" width="640"] Screenshot by Destructoid.[/caption]
Capcom franchises continue to thrive - here are the top five as of July 2023
As a surprise to nobody, Resident Evil tops the list, with 146 million units sold in the franchise's entire lifetime. This number has been boosted by Resident Evil 4 Remake, which has sold 5 million units as of July 2023.
Other titles in the series also continue to sell well, with Resident Evil 2 Remake surpassing 12 million units sold. Fans of the franchise can look forward to RE4 Remake’s VR mode which is in development.
The rest of the list looks like this:
2. Monster Hunter - 94 million units
Street Fighter - 52 million units
Mega Man - 40 million units
Devil May Cry - 29 million units
Dragon’s Dogma - 7.7 million units
Monster Hunter’s lifetime sales are to be expected, as the report also reveals that Monster Hunter Rise has sold over 13 million units, with Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak selling over 6 million units. Street Fighter 6, the latest entry in the series, launched in June and has already sold over 2 million units.
Plenty of upcoming Capcom titles will ensure those sales numbers stay high. This includes Dragon’s Dogma 2 and Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney Trilogy. Hopefully, the indefinitely delayed Pragmata also sees the light of day eventually.

So, in an evening spare of stuff to do, I booted the game up and created a druid called ANIMALS. After a few hours of pressing 1,3,2,4, in either the same pattern or different patterns, I've come to realise the game doesn't make me feel anything. I bash some skeletons, I equip a staff, I exit to Windows, I couldn't care less. Maybe, though, it's not such a bad thing?
I know I said I'd like Diablo 4 to channel Vampire Survivors and give me an auto-attack switch, so I could just steer my character through encounters without having to think at all. I still stand by my stubbornness! But having obliterated more packs of rabid wolves and legions of demons, I've come to develop what I think is ARPG muscle memory.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CD Projekt Red have announced another batch of layoffs, this time affecting “around 100” employees, or roughly 9% of the company’s total headcount. The redundancies won’t take place immediately, according to CDPR, as some employees won’t lose their jobs until early next year at the latest.


“There’s no easy way to say this, but today we are overstaffed,” said CEO Adam Kiciński in an ‘organisational update’ posted to the company’s website. “We have talented people on board who are finishing their tasks and — based on current and expected project needs — we already know we don’t have other opportunities for them in the next year,” he continued. 


“To meet our own high expectations and ambitions to create the best role-playing games, we not only want to have the best people but also the right teams,” says Kiciński. “What we mean by that is having teams that are built around our projects’ needs; teams that are more agile and more effective… After reshaping our development process and incorporating Agile methodologies, we’re now focusing on refining the shape of our teams.” Those projects in question include another Witcher trilogy, a Cyberpunk 2077 sequel, and an all-new IP codenamed Project Hadar. That’s in addition to the upcoming Cyberpunk 2077 expansion called Phantom Liberty.

We have seen Resident Evil 4 reimagined in a variety of ways over the years. Aside from the recent swanky remake, fans of the series have regularly taken the 2005 GameCube game in new and creative directions, but now we have seen it in a new dimension too (thanks, PCGamesN).
Yes, one fan by the name of DooMero is working on a complete remake of the survival horror game in the style of a 2D side-scroller. The project has been underway for a good while now, with DooMero using the engine and modding tool GZDoom to bring the concept into reality — and from what we have seen so far, this is giving all the GBA vibes.

The original Remnant: From the Ashes was a surprise success thanks to its Souls-inspired action combined with third-person shooting and randomized environments. The sequel is a refinement with new environments and expanded lore. I enjoyed my time with the game and its final boss and the shooting mechanics feel great, but Remnant II ultimately doesn’t do enough to separate itself from the genres and games that inspired it.

        <updated>2023-07-25T22:00:40.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Did you have trouble getting into Max Payne 3’s melancholic bullet-time extravaganza but couldn’t put your finger on why? I’ll tell you: it’s because the eponymous pouty-pants wasn’t wearing the face of Sam Lake, the original face model for Max Payne. Now’s your chance to finally get immersed in the dour, gritty spectacle with a new mod that transforms Max’s face back to the way the Gods of Visage intended.
The mod comes to use from Nexus user Alexsavvy. It’s no hack job either, as Max’s goes through a lot of abuse throughout the game. Alexsavvy has made sure that every scrape, bump, and misplaced strand of hair still reflects on the hero’s mug. Meanwhile, the distinct nonplussed look of the New York detective stays in place while he’s still able to move and show the full range of emotions that the original Max model did.
https://youtu.be/qAoKMhw5QmM
It goes even beyond that, as the burly physique of Max has been paired down, and all of his clothes have been altered to fit. To give a better idea of the changes, here’s what Alexsavvy had to say in their own words.
“In total, the mod replaces 98 models and 66 textures. Plus, models and textures in the mirror for the scene where Max shaves his head. Yes, you will see how Sam Lake shaves his head!”
It looks great, and I am tempted to give the game another playthrough just to check this mod out in closer detail. Sam Lake probably didn’t give permission for the use of his face, but knowing the guy (not personally), I imagine he’d be flattered. Oh, as it turns out, he just might be.
https://twitter.com/SamLakeRMD/status/1683864006233137152?s=20
You can grab the Sam Lake mod over here on Nexus.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Horror game publisher Feardemic has revealed that the 2D psychological horror adventure game Afterdream will also be coming to consoles. Afterdream will be available on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S sometime this year.
The spooky title is in development by sole developer Jesse Makkonen. Makkonen is well known for his other 2D scary titles Heal, Distraint, and Distraint 2. Afterdream is also coming to PC via Steam, through publisher Gamera Games.
To celebrate the news, Feardemic also released a creepy console reveal trailer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opqd5ri1_cM
Explore lucid dreams with a spooky camera
Visually, Afterdream looks great, with eerily creepy 2D stylized pixel art. Players use a special camera to navigate a ghastly mansion that blurs the line between reality and lucid dreaming. The camera will allow you to interact with hidden objects only visible through the lens of the camera.
I love the atmosphere of Afterdream.  It's hard to pull off a scary game using pixel art, but Makkonen definitely knows what he's doing. Also, with it being somewhat of a side-scroller, Afterdream seems honestly perfect for consoles. I'm curious to see where the story can go with this one, because I know his former games left quite an impact.
Afterdream will release sometime in 2023 on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.

In a post on the r/Starfield subreddit (as spotted by GamesRadar), user u/asd8dhd has posted their deductions from "around 200 hours" of reverse engineering. Alongside a 44-page Google Doc, they also shared a massive library of suspected skill images, collected from all the information and footage the public has seen so far.
It is, to put it frankly, exhaustive. Even though u/asd8dhd acknowledges there are some misses—and asks for readers to point out anything provably incorrect—it's an impressively in-depth investigation.

It was over seven years of waiting, but Pikmin 4 finally bloomed onto Switch last week and we love it. Bigger than any other title in the franchise, this fourth entry adds a boat-load of helpful new features, gorgeous environments and game-changing Pikmin types, but if we had one teeny tiny issue with the base game, it's that it does fall a little on the easy side of things.
To be clear, this was not enough to put us off the game in any way (you can find our 9/10 review at the bottom of this article), though on an initial playthrough, we did wish for a little more challenge. Fortunately, there is an extra helping of difficulty once the game is all wrapped up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bethesda is making up for the radio silence that engulfed much of Starfield's development by turning on the hype machine. It has just released The Settled Systems, a compilation of three Starfield animated shorts that show the game's universe.
First, there's Supra et Ultra, which is Latin for "Above and Beyond". It shows a bit of the life of a pilot who goes to New Atlantis to enlist in the Vanguard, The United Colonies' military faction. This naturally provides a good excuse to show off a neat little space battle. The animation feels a bit bare-bones at times, with a segment that barely even features any coloring, but that's clearly a stylistic choice and it looks nice overall.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kj6wulHMsA
Then there's Where Hope Is Built. It's a cute little short about a teen left orphaned by the war who saves an old man and ends up getting much-needed help in return. It's a bit formulaic, but it does a good job of reassuring players that yes, there will be side quests.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9trjxvaWP_0
Lastly, there's The Hand That Feeds. It shows a Neon City scoundrel having a fallout with her partner following a change of heart while robbing an employee of Ryuijin Industries, a mega-corporation from the planet Volii Alpha. The whole thing culminates with her getting a job at her would-be victim's megacorp. This is probably the most interesting of the bunch, as it hints that simple situations can have various possible outcomes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mX2iDI00FM
We still don't know if any of these characters will show up in the game. We also don't know whether we'll be seeing more episodes of The Settled Systems. Either way, we doubt these are the last promos we'll see from Starfield.
Bethesda will likely keep the hype machine in high gear until Starfield launches on September 6, 2023, on Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, Nvidia revealed a 16GB version of its RTX 4060 Ti graphics card. It didn't look popular based on early reports, especially as it seemed to be underperforming when compared to its 8GB variant.
Now it looks like you can already grab this card below its Recommended Retail Price (RRP), at least in Germany. According to a report from Hardware.info (as spotted by PCGamesN), the MSI Ventus 3X model of the Nvidia RTX 4060 Ti 16GB has already been dropped to €519, which is about $573 US according to XE.com.
The report goes on to say that this is $40 less than the asking price, and the damn thing only came out a few days ago.

Given the benchmark test mentioned above, the early discount isn't terribly surprising. Even Nvidia's board partners weren't excited about the 16GB version of the 4060 Ti. This isn't a worldwide price drop, but it suggests that Team Green's newest card could go cheaper elsewhere.
Honestly, I'd forgive you for not even knowing the RTX 4060 Ti 16GB was even out. Its launch hasn't result in much fanfare. Critics already felt sour on the $100 price increase compared to the 8GB model, especially considering the only difference between models is VRAM.
In any case, if you want the 16GB version, you may want to hold off for now. Price drops may be on the horizon for other countries too.

Shotguns might not be the first thing that springs to mind when you think of a game of chess, but it's a combination that developers PUNKCAKE Delicieux and Headbang Club have dreamed up for their strategy, roguelike, chess game Shotgun King: The Final Checkmate which will be blasting onto Switch on 24th August.
The game sees you play as the dejected knight of a chess set having seen all of his troops convert to the white side. Armed with only a shotgun (because why not), you have to move around the board and teach those other pieces a lesson. Eliminating the opposition king will move you onto the next floor and more upgrades — see? it's a roguelike, but chess.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Modern Wolf has announced that Afterschool Studio’s tactical space game, Cantata, is leaving Early Access and getting its full release on August 15.
Cantata is about a future war between the dickish humans and the oppressed robot masses. It takes place on the planet of Shoal, where the wildlife isn’t too happy that their habitat is being fought over. The game was pitched to me as Advance Wars meets Dune, and I can see it. But beyond the turn-based skirmishes, there’s also some base-building and exploration to be had.
https://youtu.be/vxyfRxWUQX4
I haven’t had the chance to try Cantata, but it looks pretty incredible. The bizarre neon art design is a great foundational aesthetic, but the gameplay looks expansive and tight. It’s somewhat hard to find a game that manages to capture mechanical depth and aesthetic splendor. Since I haven’t wrapped my filthy mitts around it, I can’t say for sure it’s successful, but all this evidence is pointing to yes.
It’s an unholy marriage of tactical skirmishes and grand strategy. Also, there’s a map editor and multiplayer for people who like to confound their friends.
Cantata is currently available on Steam Early Access. On August 15, it gets its full 1.0 release.

Having finished the main story of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, you are left with a few options. You can scour the rest of the world, crossing off every side quest, Shrine and Korok along the way; you can put the game down, content that you given enough hours to it already; or you can start playing around and push this version of Hyrule to its limits.
For us, it is safe to say that the third option has consumed most of our time. On an almost daily basis, we ask ourselves whether something is possible in the game and then spend a good few hours testing different methods to get there. This time, we're thinking about horses.

The announcement of Sonic Superstars sparked excitement among the fan base thanks to the return to the 2D style of gameplay found in the beloved retro entries in the franchise but complemented with gorgeous modern visuals. The game plays very much like an homage to those games that primarily lived on the Genesis, but developers Arzest and Sonic Team are adding various new elements to Sonic Superstars to expand on the classic gameplay fans are looking forward to.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You know how some games are notebook games? Well, The Banished Vault is a manual game, no two ways about it. Sure, you could theoretically make meticulous notes about all the planetary symbols and construction costs of the various buildings you'll need to harvest and convert resources into fuel, alloys and elixirs as you hurtle through space trying to escape the terrifying Gloom based on its in-game manual. But when there's a physical paper booklet that replicates all that for you in a much more easily accessible format, with several gorgeous illustrations of its mysterious space monastery to boot, not to mention infinitely better explanations of what everything does than I could ever hope to describe, it's quickly become an essential part of my play experience. 
I'm still working on my review for The Banished Vault (hopefully coming later this week), but as it launches on Steam today, I'd strongly recommend spending the extra £5/$5 to get one if you're at all interested in Lunar Division's space survival management 'em up. I don't think I could have survived in the game without it.

There have certainly been titles with mechanics of abyssal depth or vast nuance that I don’t have the dedication to wrap my head around, but this is an absolutely new level. It’s layers of things that just make me feel mentally deficient.
And I actually had to stop playing far earlier than I intended, because there was this ever-present shame that kept clawing at my spine. I was hoping that if I kept scratching at the game’s layers, something would click and suddenly it wouldn’t seem like such a monumental task. Yet, the more I played it, the more uncomfortable I was. Enough is enough. I just need to unpack right now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's gratifying to know that the FPS genre is still going strong. However, these whippersnappers wouldn't be anywhere without the granddaddy of all shooters that is the original Doom from 1993. The following year saw the release of a sequel, Doom II, which was equally impactful. So much so that people are still making mods for the game.
This one from Cheello is rather special indeed. While it's not out yet, their Voxel Doom 2 project is just around the corner. It may not look like much at a cursory glance, but it'll bring a more modern element to the iconic game without losing that original spark.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQK8m41daAk
As the name suggests, this upcoming mod will implement 3D voxels into Doom 2. Specifically, enemies, weapons, and items are being swapped out for three-dimensional models. A recent trailer (with a kickass soundtrack to boot) shows that it's going to be releasing on August 1. You can also check out some additional content on Cheello's Twitter, as well as support them via their Patreon page.
The legacy continues
Look, if you've played Doom, chances are you've come across some mods in the past. Even if you haven't played any of them, you can appreciate that a series almost 30 years old still getting love and attention is quite something.
With the recent Myhouse.wad map craze, not to mention scientists now looking to grow neurons that could potentially play Doom, id Software's iconic FPS is a legendary part of video game history.
No matter which Doom you think is the best, the franchise will stay in the limelight so long as people like Cheello continue to tweak the formula and improve on the OG releases.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sabotage Studio has revealed that the upcoming retro-inspired RPG Sea of Stars will be available as a PlayStation Plus Game Catalog title on day one of its release. The official release date for the pixel RPG is August 29. By joining the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog, all PS+ Extra and Premium members will get full access to the game on launch day.
If the visuals remind you of a lot of old-school SNES RPGs don't worry, that's intentional. Sea of Stars is technically a prequel to 2D action platformer The Messenger, which was also created by Sabotage Studio. We gave The Messenger a flawless 10/10 when it was released back in 2018.
The list of games coming to PlayStation Plus for August has not been released, though I expect it will soon. The free games are added on the first Tuesday of the month which for August is actually August 1. With Sea of Stars coming to the catalog, August will already be a great one for PS+ members.

Demo available now on PS4 and PS5
A demo for Sea of Stars was also released on PS4 and PS5 today. Sabotage Studio made sure to point out that while the areas in the demo will be in the final game, the exact slice of the demo does not reveal any major spoilers from the main story. The demo highlights some gameplay systems and the mechanics around dungeon crawling and combat. And, while there are no major story spoilers, it does provide a sense of tone and vibe.
The beautiful pixel RPG looks reminds me a lot of Chained Echoes. Our very own Eric Van Allen called Chained Echoes a surprise RPG hit when it was released late last year. It's possible Sea of Stars could share a similar fate when it releases next month.
Sea of Stars releases on PC, Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S on August 29.

And with even games like Elden Ring seeing big popularity on the portable PC platform, it's an obvious question as to whether FromSoftware's next title Armored Core VI Fires of Rubicon will also be Steam Deck compliant.
We got the chance to play Armored Core VI in a recent hands-on preview and chat with two of the team's leads, director Masaru Yamamura and producer Yasunori Ogura. During the roundtable interview, the pair were asked about the prospects of Armored Core VI on the Steam Deck.
"Obviously, seeing how Elden Ring performed on Steam Deck, we're very happy, and we wanted to at least create that as a baseline going forward for this handheld," said Ogura. "So it is f…]]></summary>

We recently got some hands-on time with Armored Core VI ahead of its August release, along with the chance to speak to the developers behind it. And as director Masaru Yamamura puts it, building the Armored Core (or AC) you pilot is a key place FromSoftware built upon.
"This has always been a staple of the series, and it’s always been a part of Armored Core’s identity," said Yamamura in a roundtable interview. "So we wanted to see what that would look like in a modern-day AC. We felt like that was an element that could translate very well, even in a modern day game and a modern day…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I sat down with GGRecon for a roundtable-ish interview with Armored Core 6: Fires Of Rubicon director Masaru Yamamura and producer Yasunori Ogura to talk more about their upcoming mecha action game. And their answers gave us more of an insight into the game's early development, where the story might take you, and how you might overcome some of its trickiest nuts and bolts.
While it won't come as much of a surprise to Armored Core veterans, Armored Core 6 isn't an open world game. If you're a new FromSoftware-liker brought on board by the expansive world of Elden Ring, then yes, you might be a bit surprised. As I mention in my preview, Armored Core 6 sees you play a mecha-mercenary who selects jobs from a drop down menu and jets off to destroy whatever needs destroying. But Yamamura says FromSoft actually considered going down a more open world route in early stages of the game's development.

And rather like Red Bull's metallic fizz of aspartame and rocket fuel, I'd say the game shares a similar makeup. It doesn't give you wings, but what it does give you is a mech as nimble as a Eurasian Blue Tit darting at a confetti of stale bread.
As a historic mech-disliker, the game actually managed to instil a desire to become a skilled mech pilot. I want to buy new metal legs and attach gatling guns to my spine! But I'm apprehensive about the grind to get those parts and whether some of AC6's Souls influences clash with its rapid pace.

But being a director requires turning a switch in his brain. He's an introvert. But when he goes to work, he has to be an extrovert. He has to lead teams, micromanage, make tough decisions, and accept making mistakes – all skills he says he learned without clear guidance. 
To be able to do that, to make that switch, Johanas says you need to be a "weird psychopath." Though he likes to think he isn't a weird psychopath. "Maybe to some people I am," he says. "I don't know." Nevertheless, no one can be at that level all the time. And yet, here he is.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sea of Stars is one of the most anticipated RPGs of the year and even graced Game Informer’s cover back in March. While the game is heading to all platforms, its playable demo has only been available on Switch. Today, it’s PlayStation fans’ turn to sample the upcoming title.
A PlayStation Blog post reveals that you can download the demo on PlayStation consoles, which unfolds in an out-of-context, spoiler-free slice of the game. Additionally, when Sea of Stars launches next month, it will be available as part of the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog for Extra and Premium subscribers on day one. 
Sea of Stars comes from Sabotage Studios and serves as a distant prequel to 2018’s The Messenger. Inspired by games such as Final Fantasy VI and Chrono Trigger, players control one of the two protagonists, Valere and Zale, who wield the power of the sun and moon to stop an evil alchemist. In addition to its dynamic turn-based combat, it features a hefty share of platforming and other traversal mechanics, creating a more active form of exploring its vibrant world.  
Sea of Stars releases on August 29 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. You can learn by checking out our exclusive coverage hub with features such as an interview with Chrono Trigger composer Yasunori Mitsuda about the soundtrack he crafted for the game. We also have a video interview with creative director Thierry Boulanger breaking down Sea of Stars’ RPG inspirations.]]></summary>

The game is such a knowing snake ball of mating tropes that it ouroboroses round into being brilliant, flawless, ridiculous. And also Alan is a terrible writer, I would hate his books.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Three decades have gone by since the original Myst graced the world, providing endless online debates about whether it's smart or just pretentious. Magical or plain bad. Some indie developers chose the latter with a Myst FPS remix that spoofed the senior adventure game. The RPS readership seemed split on the subject when we asked "Have You Played Myst?" years ago. But Humble Games leans toward the former as it’s choosing to celebrate the classic's whopping 30th birthday with a returning charity bundle, available now until August 3rd.


The Humble Myst & More Bundle packages the titular point-and-clicker, alongside several other sequels, spiritual successors, and odd offshoots from developer Cyan Worlds. You can pay anything over £7.80/$10 for the 11-game bundle, or you can pay at least £15.60/$20 to also grab the Myst remake from 2021. 


Cyan Worlds loves a good re-release, and this latest bundle is a reminder of how many Mysts have Mysted over the years. There’s Myst: Masterpiece Edition which remasters the music and imagery, and is otherwise as close to the original as you can get. Then there’s realMyst: Masterpiece Edition which added changing weather, day-night cycles, free roam movement, and a bonus epilogue. And finally, there’s the most recent pretty remake that’s also compatible with VR.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dying Light developer, Techland has announced a partnership with Tencent that will see the massive Chinese holdings company become the studio’s majority shareholder.
In a blog post penned by Techland founder and CEO Paweł Marchewka, he explains the studio has partnered with Tencent for support of its continued expansion of the Dying Light series and to ensure its upcoming fantasy RPG lives up to expectations.
“Teaming up with Tencent will allow us to move full speed ahead with the execution of the vision for our games,” Pawel writes. “We have chosen an ally who has already partnered with some of the world's finest video game companies and helped them reach new heights while respecting their ways of doing things.”
Pawel states that he will remain CEO, and Techland will retain full ownership of its IPs. He also assures the studio has full creative freedom. While the Polish company is best known as the maker of the Dying Light series, Call of Juarez, and the original Dead Island, it also has a publishing branch. Titles released under Techland's umbrella include Arise: A Simple Story and Torment: Tides of Numenera.
This is business as usual for Tencent, which has dipped its hands into a number of game studios in recent years. It has invested in (or has outright acquired) companies such as Epic Games, From Software, Turtle Rock Studios, Riot Games, Ubisoft, Activision Blizzard, Remedy Entertainment, among others.

As someone who grew up primarily in the 1990s, I’ve played more than my fair share of 2D platformers. With those decades of experience, it’s no surprise that I consider myself a relatively strong platforming player. However, despite its precise controls, Mr. Run and Jump’s challenging, neon-bathed obstacle courses and hard-to-reach collectibles had me second-guess my skills at every step.
Developed initially as a homebrew Atari 2600 game, Mr. Run and Jump errs on the side of simplicity with i…]]></summary>

The fast-paced, swashbuckling fights are endless fun, and the sun-kissed towns were a treat for the eyes, but it was honestly swoon at first sight when I first saw Adalia de Volador.
What can I say, folks? I'm in love. Let me list everything I adore about Adalia like this is my high school diary. She’s an amazing sword fighter; her acrobatic and graceful nature lets her outwit anyone who crosses her blade. She’s got panache, cheek, and a sharp wit to boot. And speaking of - her boots! Her hat! Her cape! She’s got endless style! And when she punts a soldier off a dock ledge and into the sea, my heart skips a beat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following its announcement in June, we traveled to EA Sports in Redwood City, California, to learn all about what players can expect from this iteration of the long-running Madden NFL franchise. Madden NFL 24 brings new improvements to the FieldSense system, Franchise, Superstar, and even the skeletons of the on and off-field character models. Not only that but this year signals the return of the popular minigames that have been missing for many years. 
However, one of the biggest announcements each year comes in the form of the player ratings heading into the new season. Not only does this give fans, players, and media personalities various talking points about which players are overrated and underrated, but it also lets us know which teams will be the most fun to play when the game launc…]]></summary>

Join us today on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. Central as we kick of the adventure, which will continue each week until we roll credits. We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel (or you can watch the videos in the above playlist or by clicking the links below). 
Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.
Join me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey.

Not out of a lack of enjoyment or interest, but because they were so satisfying that they left nothing else to want. Or because it would be too hard to recapture the joy of a first playthrough. Or maybe because they just ended really damn well. Whatever the reasoning, join us as we ponder our favourite games that we’ve never returned to.


Plus! We chat about the games we have been playing, from Nate’s eel-dense management adventures in Clanfolk to my wilfully patch note-ignorant return to Minecraft.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Based on the shooter series of the same name, the Borderlands film now has an official release date: August 9th, 2024. The action-comedy adaptation wrapped principal shooting in 2021, but it’s been somewhat stuck in post-production limbo ever since with several rounds of reshoots pushing out the release further than expected. 


This comes after reports that co-writer Craig Mazin - best known as the showrunner behind HBO’s The Last Of Us and Chornobyl - removed his name from the project in favour of a pseudonym. More recently, Mazin confirmed to Variety that the pen name reports were false and he’s instead “not a credited writer” on Borderlands at all anymore. Mazin is instead focusing on The Last Of Us’ second season.


The Borderlands was mostly directed by Eli Roth, known for his work on the Hostel films and Cabin Fever. Roth was reportedly busy during reshoots, however, so studio Lionsgate enlisted the help of Tim Miller, the director behind Deadpool, to helm the project for a few weeks.

There's a time-travelling detective story at the heart of it, in which you and a very Minority Report-style AI work together to stop crimes that will disrupt the one true timeline throughout history, and it's all played out on gorgeous black and white tableaus like Adriaan de Jongh's wonderful Hidden Folks. You'll rewind and fast forward time to plot suspicious movements, track stolen objects as they move across town, and work out who (or what) is causing all this chaos. I'm having good fun with it, but I do wish it would stop whisking me away from its lovely maps to go and complete yet another tedious mini-game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Asus ROG Ally has once again made itself impossible to write about without also mentioning the Steam Deck. Its latest BIOS update - out now via the MyAsus app – includes a fix that allows the handheld Windows PC to correctly run in its fastest, power-hungriest Turbo mode when connected to sufficiently high-wattage, third-party docking stations and USB-C hubs. In other words, it now works with more of the best Steam Deck docks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Pokémon Company has released another trailer for Pokémon Horizons: The Series, and it’s also the first English-dubbed trailer, too. 
This anime is the one replacing the long-running Pokémon anime that recently wrapped up after 25 seasons of pocket monster adventures. Horizons features new protagonists, Liko and Roy, who are joined by Friede, the Professor of this series, alongside Captain Pikachu. In this new English-dubbed trailer, we see Liko and her Sprigatito, Roy and his Fuecoco, Friede and Captain Pikachu, and plenty of other Pokémon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Steam Sim Fest is the latest genre-specific event, discounting dozens of games about emerging cities, dad hobbies, tactical warfare, and other stimulating simulations. Heavy hitters such as Disney Dreamlight Valley and the newest Bus Simulator are enjoying nice discounts, but as always, some hidden gems require a little bit of scrolling. The sales last until July 24th, so here are some good old recommendations from the event.


Surprise! Lakeburg Legacies is a hybrid between village management and mediaeval matchmaking , and it’s out now with a 15% sale bringing the price down to £16.50/$19.50. Love is almost as hard-to-manage as the economy, but worry not, a soothing storybook aesthetic should make this one slightly less stressful than couple’s therapy and/or mayoral duties. 


Wobbly person sim Human: Fall Flat has a hefty 70% discount and is currently £4.80/$6.50. To celebrate the puzzle-platformer’s seventh anniversary, the team are also sharing some mysterious news tomorrow. That’s in addition to a new level coming in August, so look forward to more clumsy flailing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I can't remember the last time I struggled so much to get through a game.
You misunderstand. I'm not saying ΔV: Rings Of Saturn is a chore or grind. I found it hard because any time I boot it up, I can get lost for hours just playing it. Not trying to win, not following the story, not looking for (ugh) "progression". Just mining, exploring, idly drifting through the void. It is a game I don't want to exhaust because I'm enjoying it too much. I went back in "for a quick dive" twice during this intro.
It doesn't have Content. It's not one of those compulsive, manipulative forever games. You could barge efficiently through it, finding probably all its secrets and items as fast as possible. That wouldn't be wrong, exactly, but it's missing the point: this is a game to be savoured, not consumed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another week means more freebies are available from the Epic Games Store, and this week two very different games have slashed their price tags. Starting today, The Elder Scrolls Online and Murder By Numbers are both free to keep from the digital store. Something for multiplayer dragon slayers and solo picross lovers alike. 

 
The Elder Scrolls Online is, well, The Elder Scrolls but online. The long-running MMO has been unlocking doors into every corner of Tamriel, most recently with the Necrom expansion’s otherworldly tentacles and massive mushrooms. It's good at accommodating solo players who are looking to scratch a Skyrim-sized itch - since the next Elder Scrolls is at least five years away. That approachability got the game into our list of the ten best MMOs on PC. 


On the other end of the humanities versus maths spectrum, we have Murder By Numbers, a murder mystery visual novel where you complete picross puzzles to further the investigation. Plus there's a robo-friend who pulls out a monocle every now and then, which is just plain cute. AliceB said the game was “worth a poke around if you’re a fan of either genre involved,” in our Murder By Numbers review. Even though neither half “are given enough space to breathe,” it should be worth a try for the affordable price of zero pence, though.

While the last showing of Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 focused on gameplay, today’s is all about the narrative, and it seems to be teasing who our Venom might be. 
Check it out for yourself below in the new Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 story trailer:

That pitch is getting even stronger with today’s update, as our giant friend (Onbu) is taking the village on his back (the human headlice) into the ocean. According to developers Stray Fawn Studio, the Ocean Update is the game's biggest to date and adds new buildings, decorations, random events, and of course, the titular ocean biome.

        <updated>2023-07-20T16:36:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Much has been made about Armored Core VI Fires of Rubicon’s mech-based gameplay, but a new trailer shines a light on its narrative. To the surprise of no one, though, this new look still packs in plenty of cinematic action. 
Despite the "VI" in the title, Fire of Rubicon serves as a reboot. The game unfolds on planet Rubicon in which its most sought-after resource, Coral, was the cause of a disaster that engulfed the planet in flames. Decades later, the now-contaminated planet has been condemned, but the rediscovery of Coral has attracted various factions, sparking a new war on the destroyed world. Players control mercenary C4-621 or "Raven" for short, who is thrown into this epic struggle pitting megacorporations, military forces, and other groups against each other. Based on the trailer's somber tone, it won't be pretty. 


Armored Core VI Fires of Rubicon launches on August 25 for PlayStation/Xbox consoles and PC. You can learn more by checking out our recent cover story.]]></summary>

More specifically, Skull Island: Rise of Kong will come to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC sometime this fall, according to publisher GameMill Entertainment. The game is being developed by IguanaBee and is a third-person action-adventure game set on Kong’s home turf, Skull Island. As the name implies, you control Kong (presumably before he becomes King) to take out dinosaurs, massive snakes, and other creatures vying for the top spot on the island.

He doesn't give two hoots you're here to save the world from extinction, leading (probably several) teams of nine (unwitting) brave souls into the unknown (i.e.: repeated death by alien overwatch). He's got research to do. Organs to pickle. Dead alien carcasses to splice. Yeah, the same ones you literally strapped into your troops' tactical belts in the last mission so you could bring them home. We had stinking brain monsters wrapped round our torsos, guy!

        <updated>2023-07-20T15:10:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite launching in less than a month, we haven’t seen too much of Atlas Fallen since it was revealed nearly a year ago. A general overview video released last month gave curious players a primer on what to expect from this world of sand, magic, and monsters. Publisher Focus Entertainment has followed that up with a new gameplay-focused video breaking down the game’s combat.
The five-minute video shows off the action RPG's sand-shaping action. Players can equip two main weapons to alternate attacks in fast-paced combat. These include arms like a whip, axe, and even giant fists made of sand. Attacks build momentum, which raises your power and can be spent to unleash flashy special attacks. However, the higher your momentum, the more damage you take, promoting a strategic risk/reward system.


The video also provides a look at customization, showing off Essence Stones. There are over 150 of these skills, which range from aerial attacks to setting traps to firing projectiles. The trailer also shows off the game’s two-player online co-op. Two players can complete Atlas Fallen, including its story campaign, in its entirety together. In fact, the video states some Essence Stones promote cooperative play. 
Atlas Fallen looks promising, and developer Deck13 has a decent track record (The Surge series, Lords of the Fallen), so we hope this information dump at the eleventh hour is a sign of confidence instead of a bad omen. We look forward to seeing how it shapes up when it arrives on August 10 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I thought Exoprimal somehow managed to make dinosaurs versus mechs, aka the coolest concept ever, boring in my review-in-progress. I held out hope it would improve, though, as lots of commenters assured me it's fun side would finally surface. "Just play several more hours and things really open up! Variety in the dinos, in the modes, in just about everything!". To some extent, they were right. There are fun moments to be had as you queue up for Dino Survival and suddenly, remarkably, things have changed a bit.
But the game doesn't respect your time. It forces you to sit through hours of repetitive dino-slaying and then only offers you the chance, the chance to slay dinos in a way that isn't excruciatingly samey. Even as someone who finds the fun in mindless carnage, I'd much rather ditch my mech suit and let the dinosaurs run rampant. The dinosaurs don't deserve this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gundam Evolution, the competitive multiplayer title set within the popular Gundam universe, is shutting down.
Despite launching less than a year ago in September 2022, executive producer Kazuya Maruyama shared in a blog post that support for the game will be winding down, though he doesn't provide any specifics as to why.  
“We wanted to create a title that brought FPS fans and Gundam fans together," Maruyama writes. "We challenged ourselves to create an authentic Gundam FPS game that could be played globally. Unfortunately, we have determined that it is no longer possible for us to provide a service that satisfies our players.”
A livestream detailing the sunsetting roadmap will air tomorrow, July 21 at 11 p.m. PT. Gundam Evolution’s services officially end on November 29. Until then, Maruyama states that it will still receive updates. Season 6 arrives on August 23, and the final season hits on October 25. Both seasons will introduce a new unit and maps. 
Today, the following services will be suspended:
Ending sales of EVO Coins
Ending sales of EC Pod Limited
Ending updates to EC Pods, CAP Pods, and Ticket Pods
Gundam Evolution was announced at a PlayStation State of Play in March 2022. The FPS title lets players suit up as their favorite mobile suits to battle in 6v6 matches across various game modes. Unfortunately, it now joins the growing list of multiplayer titles that closed their doors this year, which includes Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier, Babylon's Fall, Rumbleverse, Apex Legends Mobile, and Knockout City.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Might & Magic: Clash Of Heroes was one of those Nintendo DS games that I never played at the time but had always heard was very good. Its unusual triple-decker sandwich of strategic, match-three RPG puzzling hasn't really been replicated in the fifteen-odd years since it first came out, unless you count its own HD remaster that came out in 2011. Alas, with that version now having gone off sale on PC in favour of this further spruced up Definitive Edition, this is now the best and only way to play it. Originally developed by the same core team at Capybara Games that went on to make the excellent Grindstone, this Definitive Edition has been handled entirely by remake house Dotemu, and yep, I now see what all the fuss is about. However, I also have quite a lot of reservations about it. For all its clear, obvious brilliance, it's also a very hard game to love. Because it really is very hard, and I still can't quite decide if I'm having fun or not.

Then again, given the mild horror themes in many of the levels and the general terror the excellent enemy design invokes, you probably shouldn’t be playing it around kids in the first place. As a fan of this sequel’s predecessor, Remnant: From The Ashes, I had my hopes set unreasonably high, and not only has Remnant II completely met my expectations, but it also kept messing around with what I thought I should be expecting. It left me in a constant state of awe. This is a furiously ambitious follow-up and has everything I could have ever wanted.

Mortal Kombat creator and director of MK1, Ed Boon, tweeted yesterday what fans can expect at the SDCC panel, “Resetting Mortal Kombat: A New Beginning With Mortal Kombat 1,” tomorrow, and it’s going to be perhaps the most significant drop of new information we’ve received for the game yet. Boon says MK1 voice actors will be there alongside NetherRealm Studios developers to tell the “making of” story of the game. Plus, there will be three new MK1 trailers during the panel, including gameplay and a “surprise.” 
Mortal Kombat fans at San Diego Comic-Con. Wanna see a TON of new #MortalKombat1 stuffs?

July 20, 2023
As for when, the “Resetting Mortal Kombat” SDCC panel begins tomorrow, July  21, at 3:15 p.m. PT and lasts one full hour, ending at 4:15 p.m. PT. If you’re ready for new Mortal Kombat 1 footage, be sure to tune in!
MK1 was announced two months ago with a teaser trailer indicating the wider Mortal Kombat universe has been completely reset (hence the “1” in the title). The following month, in June, NetherRealm released our first look at MK1 gameplay with a trailer that featured new looks at the roster, story details, the reveal of Kameo fighters, and more. 
During Summer Game Fest, we went hands-on with it that same month and had a blast with the Kameo fighters and gory and fun fighting action. You can check out some of that action in our MK1 New Gameplay Today here. 
The latest news NetherRealm released about MK1 was a trailer earlier this month revealing Smoke and Rain in the game’s fighter roster. And tomorrow, we’ll receive more information, including three trailers. 
Mortal Kombat 1 hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC on September 19.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision Blizzard has laid off around 50 employees, according to a new report from The Verge. 
This news arrives the same day Activision Blizzard released its Fiscal Year 2023 Q2 results, which highlights a murky future for the company’s esports efforts despite an otherwise financially successful quarter for the Overwatch 2 maker. Activision Blizzard’s results show that net bookings grew 50% year-over-year in the second quarter, from $1.64 billion to $2.46 billion, due to a lucrative Diablo IV launch, an increase in revenue from various franchises, mobile growth, and more. But, despite that growth, the company laid off around 50 employees in Blizzard’s esports department, Activision Blizzard esports senior director of global communication Brad Crawford confirmed to Game Informer.

In a blog post, Blizzard explains it wants to expand its reach to players beyond its proprietary PC launcher. It believes the free-to-play Overwatch 2 is the best game to kick off this major shift in its PC release strategy. There’s currently no word on what other Blizzard games are coming to Steam, but the publisher says it will announce them “when the time is right.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Join Wesley LeBlanc, Marcus Stewart, and Kyle Hilliard as we discuss The Crew Motorfest, Ubisoft's upcoming threequel in its open-world racing series that began back in 2014 with The Crew. Wesley played roughly four hours of the game in a hands-on remote preview to learn more about its open world Oahu, Hawaii, various vehicles, racing playlists, Main Stage mode, and more. 
Enjoy more than 15 minutes of new gameplay from The Crew Motorsport in the latest NGT below: 


Ubisoft Ivory Tower developed both 2014's The Crew and 2018's The Crew 2, and the Lyon, France-based studio returns to developer The Crew Motorfest. Unlike the first two games in the series, which feature maps spanning the entire United States, The Crew Motorfest takes place in just one state: Hawaii. The island of Oahu, Hawaii, to be specific, and it features Honolulu, plenty of beautiful beaches, mountain paths to drift through, and more. 
In our NGT for The Crew Motorfest, we showcase some gameplay from the Vintage Garage playlist, which is a racing playlist devoted to vintage cars from as far back as the 1950s, the Made in Japan playlist, which is all about Japanese street racing, and a boat race on the ocean surrounding the island. 
For more about The Crew Motorfest, read Game Informer's full preview here. 
The Crew Motorfest hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on September 14, 2023. 
For more previews and discussions of some of the biggest games of 2023 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for NGTs about Ra Ra Boom, Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons, Mortal Kombat 1, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, XDefiant, and Sea of Stars.

This is the lowest price we've spotted for AMD's fastest GPU since it launched last year and a great deal for a card that originally retailed for north of £999. 
This particular model is the Asus Tuf Gaming OC design, which has been well-rated for its thermal efficiency and performance. However, this is a big card, so it's worth checking its dimensions (352.9 x 158.2 x 72.6mm) versus your case to ensure that it will fit, especially in smaller Micro ATX or Mini ATX enclosures.

The Crew, Ubisoft’s racing franchise akin to Microsoft’s Forza series and EA’s Need For Speed, has been around for nearly a decade. And since its inception, it has struggled to make a cultural dent in the racing genre, despite sales greenlighting a sequel and, now, a threequel in The Crew Motorfest. I went into a four-hour, hands-on remote preview of Motorfest, hoping to feel something different about this series. But, like The Crew 2 and The Crew before it, Motorfest feels uninspired, even if still a competent racer.

Pikmin has always held a strange spot in Nintendo’s library of games and franchises. Its creation is credited to Mario and Zelda’s dad, Shigeru Miyamoto, which means Nintendo holds it in high esteem, but it has never quite reached the cultural ubiquity of his other works. And maybe it’s unfair to compare the adorable strategy game about dragging the corpses of defeated foes into your spaceship to the iconic plumber and the Hero of Time, but Pikmin 4 might be the one that moves the series closer to those legacies. It represents a high point for Pikmin, thanks in large part to Oatchi, the helpful dog th…]]></summary>

To neznamená pro praktické používání v podstatě nic, nadále je potřeba se držet uzavřeného ovladače Nvidia. Dokud Nvidia nevydá podepsané firmwary karet této generace a od té chvíle neuběhne několik let vývoje ovladačů, nepůjde o nic použitelného pro běžný desktop.]]></summary>

That’s why Astroneer won me over with its more chilled take on the not-so-chill genre. But for those who enjoy the scary parts of space, Astroneer can now be turned into that hardcore survival experience. Or anything else you want. That’s thanks to the expansive Custom Games Mode update which launched last week - I've been working in Interstellar's timezone, sorry!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We often hear it's a miracle games even get made, but it's a statement I understand a lot better after speaking with the developers of As Dusk Falls, one of my favourite games from last year. "The script is the equivalent of twelve movies," Interior/Night's CEO and creative director Caroline Marchal tells me. "Twelve hundred pages of script. It's big, it's very big." As the team developed that script through countless drafts, they did frequent writer's rooms across three years for As Dusk Falls, but with frequent plot changes, backyard trailer shoots and the sheer grind of making it to the finish line, Marchal and studio director Charu Desodt reflect on just how ambitious it was for the studio's debut game.

In other words, Lisa was a bit of a cult classic thanks to its freaky world, absurd humour, and brutal consequences. And when I say brutal consequences, I mean your party members can permanently lose limbs or turn into mounds of saggy flesh. How’s that for a debuff? Its Definitive Edition is out now, though, so maybe its "cult" status will finally blossom into mainstream appeal. Lisa: Definitive Edition bundles in the original game and its expansion, Lisa The Joyful, as well as new enemies, bosses, stories and endings, and an easier “Painless” mode.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It looked like the upcoming PC version of Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart had already exhausted its supply of glossy, Windows-exclusive features to show off; we already knew it’s coming with DLSS, DLSS 3, FSR 2 and ray traced lighting and shadows. Turns out there’s plenty more, as port developers Nixxes Software have used a  Sony blog post to detail quite a few new tech toys – including Rift Apart’s Microsoft DirectStorage 1.2 support.
DirectStorage is simultaneously one of the most exciting recent developments in gaming hardware, and one of the most underutilised: it basically adapts your PC’s process for reading data from an SSD or hard drive in a way that can massively reduce game loading times, but has so far only made it to prime time in Forspoken. I suppose the upside is that once Rift Apart is out on July 26th, DirectStorage’s compatible games list will increase by 100%?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega has released the opening animation for Sonic Superstars ahead of the game's release later this fall. 
Sonic Superstars is a modernized 2D adventure with four-player co-op, which you’ll need to utilize to play as Sonic the Hedgehog, Tails, Knuckles, and Amy. Its announcement was one of the biggest surprises of Summer Game Fest, and after getting to go hands-on with it during SGF’s Play Days event, we came away excited about the blue blur’s latest adventure. 
Now, Sega has released the game's opening animation. Check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see, Sonic Superstars features a Sonic CD-esque opening, with its bright blue skies and emerald green plains. After dashing through some enemies, Sonic joins his buddy Tails before teaming up with the rest of the Sonic Superstars playable cast, Knuckles and Amy. Together, the four prepare to take Eggman on before speeding toward the screen. 
The trailer ends with the news that if you preorder the game, you’ll receive an “exclusive Lego Eggman in-game character skin, acrylic display stand, and reversible cover.” This preorder bonus will go great with the other Lego Sonic Superstars skins coming to the game as DLC. 
Sega has yet to reveal a release date for Sonic Superstars but it’s due out sometime this fall on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.
While waiting to learn more, read about how Microsoft, at one point, considered acquiring Sega, and then read about why we think Sonic’s latest outing, Sonic Origins Plus, is two steps forward and one step back.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I never thought I'd hear the words 'roguelite' and 'Minesweeper' together in the same sentence but here we are. Let's! Revolution! is a joyous mix of both Minesweeper and a roguelite, tasking players with hunting down a deliciously repugnant king through a series of increasingly complex tile maps to enact their titular coup. With all tiles facing down on arrival, you'll need to hop from square to square to flip them over and reveal the king's hiding place before progressing to the next level. But with several of his royal agents stalking the roads and highways, you'll need to choose your route carefully, making good use of your character's unique set of skills to arrive at your final destination of Beebom City. That, and employing a bit of the old Minesweeper noggin, of course. 
You see, tiles come in two types in Let's! Revolution! The aforementioned road tiles, and surrounding landscape tiles. The latter all have numbers denoting how many road tiles surround it, giving you just enough information to build up a picture of where the road (and the king's lackeys) might be lurking. Take care, though. This lot are a tricksy bunch, and can quite quickly overwhelm if they're revealed too soon and all at once. That's Let's! Revolution! in a nutshell, at least, but the real joy of this run-based rogue comes from its gorgeous presentation and its brilliantly conceived character classes that twist and mould its basic building blocks into fresh new forms each and every time. It's great fun, and I can't get enough of it.

That's $80 below its normal price and a great deal for a well-reviewed name-brand monitor with these specs. For context, we saw a deal price of only $10 lower during Prime Day, making this a great choice if you missed it the first time around.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unpacking is, for the most part, a laid-back puzzle game. I’ve had a cosy ol’ time taking out all the protagonist's items one by one and placing them in the various places around her rooms. From her childhood bedroom right up until her first house, I love how relaxing and gratifying it is to decorate each room. But after replaying it for this month's RPS Game Club, there’s one section that gave me quite the opposite reaction.
A big part of Unpacking is learning about the character’s personalities through their objects: what clothes they have in their wardrobes, what items fill their bookshelves, which kitchen utensils make it from move to move, and so on. These contextual clues act as a subtle but incredibly effective story-telling device. There is one level, however, where it’s not all laid-back fun times and it's when the protagonist moves in with her first partner, who I will henceforth be referring to as ‘finance bro boyfriend’ - and wow, he is the absolute worst. Spoilers ahead for those who have not played Unpacking.

Xbox Live changed the industry more than two decades ago with its multiplayer network features, but the program’s premier Xbox Live Gold has waned in popularity for the past few years, likely due to a lack of compelling free games to download. Now, Xbox is ending Xbox Live Gold on September 14 and replacing it with Xbox Game Pass Core. This new subscription tier of Xbox Game Pass will cost $9.99 per month, or $59.99 a year, and serves as an evolution of Xbox Live Gold, according to the company.

Last week, California Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley denied the FTC's request for a preliminary injunction in its case to block Microsoft and Xbox from acquiring the Call of Duty maker. The FTC sought this preliminary injunction to have the court order the tech giant to cease its attempt at acquiring Activision Blizzard for a colossal $69 billion. Following the court ruling, the FTC had until July 14 to file an appeal and it did so on July 12.

Viewfinder is all about playing with your perception and giving you the tools to do so yourself. It belongs to the difficult-to-define sub-genre of video games popularized by Portal, where you have access to a mind-blowing ability in order to solve puzzles. The danger with giving the player these kinds of god tools to get them to their destination is sometimes the well of creativity can run dry by the end, or it all just gets so complicated that the fun disappears.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Adibou, the first game in the beloved children's series, is now ready for public testing!
Also known as Adi Jr.'s World of Discoveries, this 1991 Coktel Vision title began the educational Adibou collection aimed at children of age 4 to 7 years.
Many of the iconic activities and mechanisms of the series were already part of this first opus: planting flowers, playing the game Breakout, and being rewarded with sweets upon completing Read/Count exercises. And of course, this was Adibou's first appearance! Although the floppy release has him speak the same strange gibberish as heard in the Goblins series, he is still the patient and funny learning partner that he's remembered for being in later games.
ScummVM supports all of the game's releases, from the initial 16-color floppy ones to later 1994 CD versions with richer graphics and sound effects. So dig out your dusty Adibou disks, get a ScummVM daily development build, and start collecting sweets while completing math and reading exercises! Please also contact us if you own a version ScummVM is not yet aware of, and report to the issue tracker any problem you may encounter.
As much as ScummVM aims to replicate the original gaming experience, there is one feature we are unfortunately unable to support. When hardworking children complete their virtual sweets collection, a message invites them to mail a floppy disk with their savegame to Coktel Vision, who would send them a parcel containing Coktel goodies and actual sweets! So if you are introducing children to Adibou through ScummVM, be prepared to go to the nearest shop and buy some candy for when they finish the game!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stray Gods: The Role-Playing Musical has been delayed by one week. 
Initially due out on August 3, the musical RPG will now hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on August 10. As for why, publisher Humble Games and developer Summerfall Studios says it is taking the extra week to work on performance parity across all platforms and to allow players the space to play Larian Studios’ upcoming RPG, Baldur’s Gate 3. 


Here’s what Humble Games and Summerfall Studios have to say about the Stray Gods delay: 
For the uninitiated, Stray Gods is a hand-illustrated role-playing musical where players will decide lines in songs, similar to picking dialogue choices in an RPG. The music is composed by Grammy-nominated composer Austin Wintory (Journey, The Pathless, Assassin’s Creed Syndicate), Tripod, and Montaigne. 
These songs are performed by a cast filled with names you might recognize, too, like Troy Baker, Ashley Johnson, Rahul Kohli, Janina Gavankar, Felicia Day, and more. Laura Bailey voices the lead, Grace, a college dropout in the game’s modern fantasy world granted the power of a Muse. This power is what Grace uses to “find out the truth behind her predecessor’s death before time runs out,” according to a press release.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[U.K. regulatory agency, the Competition and Markets Authority, has extended its deadline for delivering a potentially new ruling on Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard acquisition by six weeks. 
In April, the CMA blocked this acquisition over cloud gaming concerns, making Microsoft’s fight for the green light in this acquisition more challenging. But it shifted its sights on the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S. afterward, with plans to appeal the CMA’s ruling in the meantime. 


Earlier this week, California Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley denied the FTC’s request for a preliminary injunction in its case to block Microsoft and Xbox from acquiring Activision Blizzard. Shortly after that decision, Microsoft announced it paused its appeal efforts in the U.K. to negotiate with the CMA. The deadl…]]></summary>

The move away from the FIFA license was announced last year, and today, we got our first look at this year's EA Sports soccer title.
The big pitch this year from EA Sports is around its advanced technology. EA's proprietary Frostbite engine returns, but with enhancements, including the new Sapien character model skeletons first introduced through our Madden NFL 24 coverage last month. The skeleton ensures that players look more true to life when standing still but also in motion, making for more realistic movement that affects both the game's visuals and gameplay. This year's implementation of Frostbite also includes new GPU cloth technology, which i…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Clock Tower series is a favorite among horror game aficionados, but the first game has never been released outside of Japan. That finally changes as the 1995 classic is getting spruced up for a modern, international re-release.
For any Americans thinking, “But we got the first Clock Tower on PlayStation,” we actually didn’t. The 1997 game known as “Clock Tower,” which did release in the West, was really Clock Tower 2 and was titled as such in Japan (watch us play it in this classic episode of Replay).
The actual first game arrived on Super Famicom (SNES) and stars Jennifer Simpson, an orphan adopted by the Barrows family only to find that a murderous stalker called the Scissorman is terrorizing their mansion. As a point-and-click adventure, you use a mouse cursor to guide Jennifer and interact with your surroundings to solve puzzles and find clues while evading the Scissorman. The game also features multiple endings. Clock Tower is considered one of the forefathers of survival horror and has been ported to different platforms, such as PC and the Wii/Wii U eShops, several times in Japan. 


Wayforward is handling this port, which is being made using Limited Run Games’ Carbon Engine. As discussed in the developer diary video above, improvements include the game's first official English localization (along with multiple language options), a new animated intro, motion-comic cutscenes, and a new vocalized theme song by famed anime and Silent Hill singer Mary McGlynn. It also includes an art gallery, save states, and other modern tweaks. 
Clock Tower is coming early next year for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC. Limited Run Games is also releasing premium physical versions of the game.]]></summary>

The survival genre is one that’s never entirely worked for me. Life is already stressful enough, and playing a game built on the idea of stress, resource management, and, well, survival has never appealed to me in my off-hours. But Keen Games, the studio behind Portal Knights, let me watch roughly an hour of gameplay of its new survival game Enshrouded behind closed doors, and I came away excited about everything it’s doing to alleviate the stresses of the genre. 
Keen Games describes Enshrouded as an open-world survival action RPG set in a post-apocalyptic fantasy world drowned by a mysterious fog. You play as a unique person brought back to life by a powerful force called The Flame. From there…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Join Wesley LeBlanc, Marcus Stewart, and Kyle Hilliard as we discuss Ra Ra Boom, an upcoming beat 'em up headed to PC in early 2024. Wesley played through the demo multiple times, using each character to take down AI and robots alike. He, Marcus, and Kyle discuss the game's visual style, use of lanes in combat, fully-voiced characters, and more. 
Enjoy roughly 12 minutes of all new Ra Ra Boom gameplay in the latest NGT below: 


In 2008, Chris Bergman, who later co-founded Gylee Games and now works as its CEO, bought the domain to raraboom.com. Today, that site takes you to the Steam page for Ra Ra Boom, the beat 'em up featured in our latest installment of New Gameplay Today. Gylee Games started work on the game back in 2019, before the resurgence of beat 'em up games, but Bergman is stoked about said resurgence. He calls it a "rising tides raise all ships" scenario. 
After playing through this demo multiple times, I'm excited for Ra Ra Boom's full release. Its inclusion of lanes has fixed my largest problem with beat 'em ups: my inability to properly target and hit enemies. Add in the fully voiced characters, beautiful art style, fun cast of ninja cheerleaders, and an emphasis on story that's somewhat rare in the genre, and I'm ready to smash some robots. 
Ra Ra Boom hits PC early next year.
For more previews and discussions of some of the biggest games of 2023 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for NGTs about Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons, Mortal Kombat 1, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective, Eternights, Bramble: The Mountain King, Humanity, Afterimage, Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster Collection, XDefiant, Sea of Stars, and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor.
Editor's Note: This article has been updated to reflect that Ra Ra Boom will launch early 2024.

In the first post, we went into a bit into the infrastructure that runs OpenTTD, from BaNaNaS to our main website. In this post, we will explain a bit about the migration we just did to get to this infrastructure. After over 2 months of work, I am happy to announce we finished (another) infrastructure migration. Today is the day I removed the last few DNS entries pointing to AWS’s DNS servers, and I am proud to mention that (almost) all traffic is now routed via Cloudflare (and we aren’t even receiving sponsoring to say so). In this post I want to take you with me why this migration was needed, what the benefits are, and why you possibly care. But in short summary: (Much) smaller monthly bill as AWS charges insane amounts for bandwidth. Faster download speeds for you (ranging from the in-game content service to downloading the game from our website). Easier maintainability of our infrastructure with thanks to Pulumi. This will be a bit nerdy, so if you like these kind of things, continue the read!]]></summary>
