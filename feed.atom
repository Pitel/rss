        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A little over a week after the release of the first two episodes of Star Wars' The Acolyte, an attempt at negatively review-bombing the new series on Rotten Tomatoes has begun. 


Seeing anything Star Wars-related requiring more than one second after its release to gather an avalanche of negative reactions nowadays is already pretty surprising, but this story gets even better. It turns out that the review bombing campaign pretty much ignored the actual Star Wars Acolyte TV series, and accidentally ended up hitting other works whose creators were unlucky enough to name after the word "Acolyte".




The biggest victim is a 2008 Thriller called Acolytes, which is now sitting at 35% Audience Score after a barrage of negative SW-related ramblings.

Super Smash Bros. creator Masahiro Sakurai has previously mentioned how he planned to wrap up his YouTube channel, and now he's shared another update about this on social media. According to a rough translation, he's now finished recording the final episode. Just don't expect to see it any time soon, as it will apparently be a while before it's released.
Until then, you can continue to enjoy his regular uploads like his most recent video focused on attack collision in games. Throughout his channel's lifespan, he's also shared plenty of other tips and insights about game design - covering areas such as sound, graphics, controls, animation, and various other interesting topics related to this subject.

Sometimes, however, we get answers for questions nobody would ever think to ask, such as "Does Mario happen to have around 254 more brothers who are not fit to be in the game?". The answer is "Yes, and what a good guess!" Mario has exactly 254 more brothers.

Ahead of the Founder's Packs going live and players flooding the servers, developer Mainframe Industries invited me to take a look at the game and get a sense of its vision. 


Calling Pax Dei an MMO would be underselling it. Once players load into the game, they're able to choose their server, which is a chunk of the 400 square kilometer space available at launch. Each server or shard is a place where players can work together to build a settlement, but not in the traditional way you might think.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Video game adaptations have a harder job than most TV shows. While they come with an audience built in, game-inspired series have to do more than simply appeal to fans of the original medium. They've got to attract longtime fans and lorehounds, all while simultaneously telling a story that can be understood by the uninitiated. 


While the task is difficult, it isn't impossible. The Fallout TV show has shown itself to be a perfect example in this regard, earning praise from critics, Fallout fans, and general viewers alike. But what is it about the show that accomplishes what so many adaptions can't? The secret sauce lies within a few of its classic narrative techniques, cleverly working in faithful nods to its source while creating a world for the general audience.

Pickaxe spawns have been temporarily disabled


Screenshot by Destructoid


Unfortunately for players hoping to get some easy Legendary modules, this exploit was busting the economy of Fallout 76. Bethesda released a hotfix to temporarily disable Pickaxes from spawning in the world. This also means that if you have the blueprint to craft a Pickaxe, you’ll get a “lack the requirements” message when you try to make one.


However, even after the hotfix, Pickaxes still appear in some locations, and they occasionally drop from Scorched enemies as well. Here are the places you’ll want to check out to find a Pickaxe after the hotfix:



Foundation – Exterior


Gauley Mine


Glassed Cavern


Nuka World On Tour – Tunnel of Love



Where to find Pickaxes in Fallout 76 normally


Screenshot by Destructoid


If you want a Pickaxe because you’re a completionist and need to collect every weapon in the game, you might want to know all the places you can find them in normal circumstances. In addition to the above locations, Pickaxes usually spawn in the following areas:



Blackwater Mine


Garrahan Mining Headquarters


Greg’s Mine Supply


Lucky Hole Mine


Miners Monument


Tygart Wastewater Treatment Plant 



Though Pickaxes can currently still be found in Fallout 76 even after the hotfix, it’s only a matter of time before Bethesda notices the oversight and also disables those spawn locations or patches the Legendary module glitch. So if you’re hoping for some easy looting, you might want to hurry.

Now it's getting a shot at video games with the newly-announced and tentatively-titled Kaiju No. 8 THE GAME. 


Akatsuki Games is in charge of development and distribution for the Kaiju No. 8 game. The studio is also behind Extreme Baseball action-RPG Tribe Nine, which was first announced in 2021 and finally has a closed beta test on the way this August. Neither that nor Kaiju No. 8 have release dates in place yet.

Welcome back, one and all, as we delve into the Nintendo Life Mailbox once more.
It's Direct season, and Summer Game Fest has done a good job of whetting our appetite for hearty Nintendo announcements sometime soon. It's been a little quiet recently on the Switch front, which may have something to do with the small amount of correspondence we received this month. Perhaps you're all out enjoying fine weather and great video games, but Mr. Postman had just a handful of letters in his bag for us. Publishable ones, at least.

From the lighthouse in Arcadia Bay to the record store in Haven Springs, the spaces created for the games are filled to the brim with nostalgic feelings. As the series has grown, so too has the complexity of its timeline. 


Not counting Life is Strange: Double Exposure, which is due to come out later this year, the Life is Strange series currently spans about 12 years. However, the choices you make, particularly at the end of the original game, can send this timeline into a spin. Here’s a more organized look at all the Life is Strange games in chronological order.

No, it’s not the key on your keyboard. Rather, it’s a detective story set on a distant planet. Important data has been stolen, and the perpetrator is a shape-shifter laying low in a spaceport dive bar until he can flee off-planet. You play a hard-boiled detective who has the skill to psychically visit bar patrons’ memories to gather clues and narrow down suspects.
This is thanks to the kind people at ZOOM Platform, who provided us with the original game sources to work with. Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game features a lot of options to chat around with bar patrons’ and do various actions in the different flashbacks. So we really need people to spend time experimenting and make sure everything works correctly. And please take some screenshots along the way.
If you don’t own The Space Bar, you can try one of the free demos or purchase it digitally from the ZOOM Platform. Testing is also available on Steam via a beta branch, check the Steam announcement for more details.
Now, good luck, and fingers crossed you can find the perp. Otherwise, your bureau chief will have you getting up close and personal with toilet duties for the rest of your career. Oh, and PS: The viewpoints of different aliens differ. For the Bartender, who has segmented eyes, even the original developers felt it was difficult and left in a cheat key of ScrollLock to switch back to a single viewpoint. Feel free to use it if, at any point, the flashback becomes too much for you :)

As a series, Doom has not only survived against an ever-changing industry, but has stayed relevant and continues to be successful. Sure, there was a period where it felt like it may not ever make a glorious comeback, but it's stuck around because somebody needs to keep the demons of hell at bay.


With the new game on the horizon, I thought it was time to remind ourselves just where it all began. This brief history of Doom aims to reflect on the…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XVI ended up being one of my favorite games from last year. Clive’s journey to liberate the oppressed magic-weiding Bearers of Valisthea and cleanse the world of the spreading Blight won me over with its earnest and lovable characters, flashy and frenetic fights, serene and grandiose soundscapes, and the titanic, cinematic boss battles that are simply unforgettable.


But for all of its many achievements, Final Fantasy XVI felt a bit simple and underdeveloped at times. A number of design choices seem derived from the developer’s previous experience with Final Fantasy XIV, while other elements fail to meet the same complexity and variety as its MMO counterpart.


If the recently rebranded Creative Studio III gets an opportunity to follow up on this style of Final Fantasy game,…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Resident Evil developer Capcom recently announced that it will bring the seventh entry in its iconic series, Resident Evil Biohazard, to all Apple devices with an M1 chip or better. For Mac laptops, that means any Mac Book Air or Mac Book Pro from late 2020 onwards will be able to run the game.


However, this isn’t the first time Capcom has released a Mac and iOS port for the Resident Evil series. The current Mac Resident Evil games are essentially a dedicated showcase of just how powerful the M-series chips and integrated graphics cards can be, especially on devices such as the Mac Book Air, which don’t have a fan. 


Resident Evil Games for Mac Available Now


Mac and iPhone users can currently purchase both Resident Evil Village and the Resident Evil 4 remake via their device’s App Store. Resident Evil Village on Mac in particular is a spectacle to behold; I can personally vouch for its impressive performance on the M1 Mac Book Air. While there have been a few audio glitches here and there, the port is exceptionally well optimized.

The Resident Evil 4 remake on M1 devices also has generally positive reviews on the Mac App Store, though users should note that you’ll need approximately 125 GB of free space on your drive to install the game, which is nearly double the listed size requirement in the store. 


Upcoming Resident Evil Games for Mac


The Resident Evil Biohazard Mac and iOS port is currently slated for July 2nd, 2024. However, Capcom has also announced on its Apple games page that it will be bringing the Resident Evil 2 remake to all M-series Apple devices as well. We don’t have a release date for this one yet, but if the previous Mac Resident Evil ports are anything to go by, it’s sure to be an exceptional experience.

Through fan art that usually shows memes or epic landscapes, players are instead highlighting those they fight for in the Helldivers universe. 


Usually, Major Orders are little more than flavor text that justifies playing more Helldivers 2. Yes, they add to the story, but the gameplay is what we're all here for, and if we can make it into just one more mission by shouting, "Won't someone please think of the children?!" then we're absolutely going to do it. Right now, though, Helldivers 2 players are experiencing a more somber mood, sharing artwork that commemorates the children and civilians they save on a daily basis, not just in the recent Major Order.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’ve become very accustomed to seeing new Paldeck videos released by Palworld every weekend, but the one released on June 15 is slightly different. Rather than showcasing a Pal we’ve come to know, they showed off a Pal that we’ve yet to meet — Chillet Ignis. 




Chillet has become a huge fan favorite among players. The original Ice type Pal is a fluffy looking Dragon capable of inflicting huge damage, all while looking cute, and the Ignis variant is no different. 


Chillet Ignis looks like someone took the original Chillet and turned up the color temperature, which is apt, because as a Fire type this Pal is likely to bring the heat. Apparently, Chillet Ignis is capable of spinning so fast it will emit sparks, so it might be best to give this one a wide berth until it warms up to you. Pun intended. 


The Alpha Chillet Ignis shown in the Paldeck video is a level 52, which is an exciting reminder that more levels are coming when the Sakurajima update arrives on June 27. This is excellent news to anyone like myself, who has taken a break through a lack of levels to climb or new content to experience. 


We’re usually given two Paldeck videos each weekend, so the next should release tomorrow. The sneak peak at the end of the Chillet Ignis video shows another much loved Pal, despite the fact that it’s not even in the game yet — Croajiro, the small frog armed with a stick.

From plushes to figurines, clothing and even terrifying nightmare fuel, if you look hard enough you’ll be able to find everything Palworld related, but none of it is official merch. 


Posting on Twitter this morning, Pocketpair has assured that there is indeed some official merchandise on the way, if fans can wait a just little longer to get their hands on it. 




Accompanying this plea was a purposefully faded image of a Cattiva plush, giving fans something to get excited about. However, the comments were mostly focused on fans asking for their favorite Pal in plush form - although a staggering lack of those are after a Depresso plush, I must say.

Anthology for the Killer is a compilation of nine previously available, completely absurd, short-form horror titles that have decided, as many of us have, that reality really sucks. But while there’s a heaping dose of comedy mixed inseparably with the rest of the horror stew, the pure discomfort of not finding a reliable grip is enough to make you sweat. Or whatever people do when they’re afraid.

#10 Wayfarer Series - Becky Chambers


The Wayfarer Series by Becky Chambers is one of the most recently published science fiction series on this list, but it still deserves its place. For anyone new to the genre, it is a fantastic gateway into the world of space-based drama and adventure.

As part of Shovel Knight's 10th anniversary celebrations, Yacht Club Games will be going back to where it started, with the original game Shovel of Hope - only this time it's getting the 'DX' treatment! You might remember a few titles of yesteryear getting the same treatment after their initial run and now we've got Shovel Knight: Shovel of Hope DX.
This is a new "enhanced edition" of Shovel Knight's adventure that started it all. Apart from Steam, no other platforms have been confirmed (but a Nintendo release seems highly likely given the series' history) and we don't have a release date just yet, but we do know that it's "coming soon", so hopefully there's not long to go.

A portion of it has been overtaken by a desolate post-apocalyptic wasteland occupied by sparse thrown-together structures. Players don't want to be caught traversing it on foot, either, seeing as massive weapon-equipped vehicles of all varieties roam the landscape. It's all very much Mad Max-inspired, and yet, there's no Mad Max tie-in to be seen.


The very same day Fortnite Chapter 5: Season 3 kicked off, Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga released in theaters. After ages of development, the story of Mad Max: Fury Road's favorite Imperator Furiosa (Anya Taylor-Joy) was told on the big screen.

Players take turns choosing a card from their hand of fanciful picture cards, describe it with a word or very short phrase, and then every other player also chooses a card from their hand that they feel matches that phrase. The chosen cards are shuffled together and players have to decide which they think was the original card. It sounds easy, but the tric…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fashionably late.
Yes, yes - we know Nintendo Switch is old now. There comes a time in each console's life when the games start to dry up and we look to the future, and the Switch is very much in the autumn of its years. Back in May, two months into its eighth year, Nintendo said a new hardware announcement is coming at some point before April next year, and with that acknowledgement comes a sense that the really good stuff will be saved to launch the next console with a bang.
However, looking back at past Nintendo systems, it doesn't necessarily mean Switch will be running on fumes for the rest of the year. You would have been forgiven for thinking Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom was the Switch's last hurrah, and then Super Mario Bros. Wonder turned up. You may have thought the release of Switch in 2017 meant that the might 3DS' days of quality exclusive software were numbered, but as we'll highlight below, that wasn't the case. In fact, Nintendo has good form when it comes to putting out brilliant games at the very end of a console's lifecycle and having sold over 140 million Switches, there's a high chance that there's still gold in them first-party hills, as well as all the third-party stuff we already know about.

The Switch has an extensive library of games covering all sorts of franchises and while it's got plenty of Final Fantasy titles nowadays, one game still missing in this particular series is Square Enix's massive (and highly successful) multiplayer role-playing game Final Fantasy XIV Online. So will we ever see it on a Nintendo system?
Game director and producer Naoki Yoshida (also known as Yoshi-P) was recently asked by Easy Allies about the possibility of a Nintendo release and mentioned how he wants to see the game available on as many devices as possible in the long run. This apparently includes Nintendo's hardware, and at the rate it's going, the new target could potentially be the Switch's "successor".

It's the weekend once again folks, which means it's time to shake off the stress and responsibilities of the week and wind down with a bit of gaming. Bliss.
Before we get cracking with what we're playing, however, let's just recap some of the top stories of the week, hm? First up, Summer Game Fest was a whole thing, and you can check out every game that we managed to experience during the Play Days event. With Nintendo's own Direct showcase on the horizon, too, we thought we'd lay out our predictions for what may be one of the final Switch Directs before Nintendo reveals its new console.

Yacht Club Games held its special 10th anniversary celebrations for Shovel Knight earlier on, and to go out with a bang it shared a big surprise - revealing a new game in this series is currently in development. It's not just another sequel or spin-off, either - it's a "new mainline" game described as the next big "bold new adventure".
The team behind Shovel Knight says it's "committed to crafting an experience that not only honors the Shovel Knight legacy but also pioneers groundbreaking, innovative gameplay mechanics". What's even more exciting about this is it will apparently launch Shovel Knight into an "entirely new dimension of gaming"...could we finally see a 3D release or maybe some other generational leap?

Let me get this out of the way – being at Summer Game Fest was amazing.
The people were amazing. The variety of games, both big and small, were amazing. I was lucky enough to go to E3 twice back when I wrote for a different site, and I would take the laid-back vibes, the layout, and the ability to socialise at my own pace any day of the week over the crowded convention centre of E3.

With 10 different packs to pick from, it becomes an increasing fuss to remember which pack has which game in, and then boot it up just to play its highlight before repeating the process when you choose to play something else.

Until now, there hasn’t really been much of a choice on Switch. There’s EA Sports FC (which thankfully, finally, is worth getting now), but with Konami’s eFootball (formerly PES) nowhere in sight, the other options are arcade-style indie games whose quality varies wildly.

Our Adventurer Guild is cheerfully simple in appearance, and its turn-based fights and griddy missions establish its parts at once as familiar, potentially even by-the-numbers. But those parts are arranged into an original and deceptively detailed mercenary management game that got harder to put down the longer I played.

This week, it was a completely context-free message containing several photos of what appear to be artificial houseplants from a man named ‘Harold’. We take criticism seriously here, so I can only assume the sender intended the contents of these imposter pots to be judged as such. Well, I’m nothing if not obliging. Apologies for the quality of the images. I screen-grabbed then resized them up because I was too scared to download them in case they contained explosives or something.

It seems mad to think of Kanitsu-Gami: Path Of The Goddess this way, given that on some level, it is a tower defence game. Tower defence! The archetypal browser-based strategy experience and darling of emerging smartphones. The great-uncle once-removed of today's idle clickers. Without meaning any disrespect to those currently working in the genre, which I've had a tonne of fun with, when's the last time you were seriously excited by tower defence? As of this week, I am seriously excited by tower defence, because Path Of The Goddess has captured my imagination. It's a stately, beautiful thing. I had a go at this year's Keighleycon, and it's one of two games at the show I wanted to carry on playing once my time was up.

Japanese developer M2, known for its work on Castlevania Advance Collection, Legend of Mana, and the superb Dodonpachi DaiOuJou Blissful Death Re:Incarnation, has stated that it wants to bring more of its games to the Nintendo Switch.
Speaking to Touch Arcade, M2's CEO and founder Naoki Horii confirmed that the studio is "always looking for that opportunity" to release more games on the Switch. He also later clarified, however, that "there are so many things I want to do compared to what I can actually do", which likely means that Switch owners may have to make do without a few titles, despite M2's best efforts.

14th June 2024 marks the 30th anniversary of Donkey Kong for the Game Boy's Japanese release. It's one of the finest games on the system and a hybrid arcade port/spin-off that ushered in the Mario vs. Donkey Kong series which recently came to Switch.
In honour of the occasion, we thought we'd highlight this 2020 video examining the game made by erstwhile NL YouTube chap and all-'round good bloke Jon Cartwright. Here's hoping Nintendo adds this to the Switch Online GB lineup soon. Enjoy!

Ubisoft has been pretty quiet on the upcoming launch of Beyond Good & Evil 20th Anniversary Edition. However, the discovery of the game's trophies via Exophase (thanks, VGC) may indicate that its release is just around the corner.
It would make sense too, right? With Nintendo confirming a Direct showcase to be aired at some point this month, Beyond Good & Evil feels like the perfect game to crop up during the presentation. Ubisoft also confirmed that it would be released in 'early 2024', but since we're arguably well beyond that point now, we feel it could drop on the Switch eShop at any point.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ten years ago, we were drowning in early access survival games about chopping trees and crafting camp fires. Rust pit monstrous players against one another, DayZ had us dashing around for beans and bleach, while The Forest creeped us the hell out in a dark jungle. There was even a week-long celebration here at RPS called survival week to get the genre out of our systems. A lot of those games have since graduated to a full 1.0 release, but one survivalist shambled on. 7 Days To Die is a solid sandbox craft 'em up with zombie hordes, and it never left the comfort of its early access log cabin surrounded by spikes and land mines. But a (tentative) release date is finally on the horizon, according to the developers. And it's quite soon.

The demo in question was for Monster Hunter Wilds, which they probably should rename Monster Hadron Collider in that a major selling point appears to be making the megafauna converge and murder each other. It's possible to do this in previous games, especially 2018's Monster Hunter: World, but not like this. Not like this. Alas for the Alpha Doshaguma.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No, it's not Silversun. Sit down, Brian. Let somebody else have a go at answering. Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector is a sci-fi RPG with plenty of dice and a heavy nod towards tabletop role-playing. The first Citizen Sleeper saw your bio-robotic protagonist landing on a donut-shaped space station where they learned to make a new life for themselves among interstellar farmers and ramen-serving rapscallions. In the sequel, a demo of which I've played [smug face], the hook is a little different. This time you're being pursued across a bunch of backwater truck stops, colonies, depots, and derelicts. All the while your misfit crew will clash and commingle. You still haven't got it, have you? Ugh. I suppose I'll let the game's designer tell you then.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disco Samurai is a game that’s so difficult I’d have given up playing sooner if it didn’t contain so many of my absolute favourite action game things. Tense, decisive duels. Violence that’s both brutal and a little silly. Scalpel-sharp parry n' strike back-and-forths. Short stages that dole out chunky progression hits of dopamine, as quickly as they wrest those hits away from you with another humbling beatdown. Perhaps most importantly, it aims to do one thing - rhythm combat - and does it brilliantly. It's got teeth, but it's also got groove.

Alice thought it over for a week, and then emailed her response: no.

Thank god I was able to change her mind, so I could spend the next six years giving her shit about it. But now Alice is leaving RPS, and you should join me in saying goodbye.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a little sheepish about how much I'm looking forward to Cat Quest 3. It's neither big budget and mainstream, nor a conceptually thrilling indie. If the first two games are anything to go by, it'll be a paint-by-numbers action-RPG with simple combat, lots of grind, and endless cat and dog puns.

Yeah. That's why I like it, though. Now it has a release date: August 8th.

      <p>Netflix had released a new trailer for Season 2 of <em>Arcane</em>, the hit animated series set in the League of Legends universe. Set to premiere in November, show creators Christian Linke and Alex Yee confirm the upcoming season will be the show's last.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AEbfiLaOdJA" width="640"></iframe>

<p>Season 2 is billed as "the final chapter" and will center on Jinx's attack on the Council, which will be the centerpiece of the escalating Piltover/Zaun conflict. Hailee Steinfeld (Vi) and Ella Purnell (Jinx) will reprise their roles in Season 2. While <em>Arcane</em> will conclude, Christian Link stated during a League of Legends dev update today that it won't be the last animated tale based on the franchise.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“<em>Arcane</em> is just the beginning of our larger storytelling journey and partnership with the wonderful animation studio that is Fortiche," said Linke. "From the very beginning, since we started working on this project, we had a very specific ending in mind, which means the story of <em>Arcane</em> wraps up with this second season. But <em>Arcane</em> is just the first of many stories that we want to tell in Runeterra.”</p>

For those of you only now noticing that tens of thousands of Twitch viewers have been religiously watching video game Hot Wheels, let me elucidate. Deep Dip 2 is a fan-made tower of racetracks that was published as a challenge to the racing game's community last month. It is 16 floors of unfathomably difficult ramps, tunnels, ledges, pipes, and beams. A simple mistake sees drivers plummeting to the bottom, like the sad cauldron man of Getting Over It. The first three players to finish would share a prize pool of over $32,000. Over the weekend, one player has now managed it, and another has since joined him. Third place is still up for grabs but, mate, I wouldn't recommend it.

      <p>Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is getting an update on June 18 that "addresses some community feedback and adds stability improvements to the game," but the more exciting detail is the addition of eight new suits, one of which is in reference to the Spider-Verse films.</p>

<p>A suit inspired by Peter B. Parker's look will be available for Peter Parker, seen below, although it does lack his telltale gut. The other seven suits, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/11/marvels-spider-man-2-update-includes-suit-collab-and-fan-favorites-available-june-18/">which can be seen on PlayStation's blog</a>, have been created by guest designers KidSuper, Vini Jr, Lando Norris, and Rina Sawayama. There are also a few suits referencing specific Spider-Man lore, and a new Mile Morales suit (seen above) that "is reminiscent of classic cartoons and comics of old."</p>

Dragon Age: The Veilguard - previously Dragon Age: Dreadwolf, strictly speaking Dragon Age 4 - is not the bantzy heist romp suggested by its debut trailer. Less Good News for returning players: going by the 45 minute segment I was shown at Summer Game Fest, Dragon Age: The Veilguard is more of a single-character action-RPG plus entourage, than a proper party-based affair in the vein of 2014's Dragon Age: Inquisition. You do get a party, drawn from a retinue of seven, larger-than-life, romanceable companions encompassing a range of classes, abilities and go-faster hairdos, but control of that party has been streamlined, and there's a God Of Warlike emphasis on booting Fade demons into pits. Hmmm.

For as long as I’ve been excited, I’ve also been worried. It’s been a polarising experience, like being alternately fed delicious sandwiches and those inedible rotlogs they sell at Subway. Still, I’ve remained cautious: is all this great pixel-art just a shroud pulled over a ho-hum tactics game to rescue it from naffness? It’s with this in mind I hungrily dove into the Steam Next Fest demo, as one might hungrily dive into a bin to eat literal garbage if their only other option was Subway.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The playable area in Caravan SandWitch’s Steam Next Fest demo isn’t all that big, but within seconds you’re plonked at the rusty wheel of an offroading motorhome and let loose to roam it. It’s a figurative "Go nuts," and given how much more this narrative-heavy, third-person exploration yarn seemingly has to give, it's an attitude I’m seriously hoping holds firm throughout the full game.

Nearby to this now-famous site of grace camps a merry band of blood-cursed Albinaurics, as well as a stupid gross bird you can trick into killing itself over and over again. I do not give a single solitary biscuit about that leperous avian, but I’ll be damned if I’m going to waste my new-found position of prominence on this glorious website by not moralising at you heartless rune-hoarders about the unconscionable violence you keep inflicting on my bulbous, shiny frog sons. With Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree out soon, the amount of violence the community is collectively inflicting is breaking my tiny heart.

Piracy Shield launched in February under new law that compels all 300+ of the country's ISPs to block pirate streaming services. It now transpires that Italy's blocking system was only designed to accommodate 70 ISPs and now times out under the strain. By end of 2024, Piracy Shield Phase 2 will make its debut.

In a literal sandbox that might be anything from a kid burying a freshly-laid turd like a mischievous cat ready to be stepped on by an unsuspecting trespasser, gathering handfuls of grit to lob in a another kids’ eyes or swallowing a bunch of sand (hopefully turd-free) in pursuit of alchemising diamonds in their stomach. There don’t seem to be turds of any kind in upcoming sandbox RPG Streets of Fortuna, but that’s about the only thing that this ambitious “megasim” appears to be missing in its sprawling go-anywhere, do-anything open world.

Here are some basically non-scoundrelly, very Ubisofty things I did during my 60 minutes with Massive Entertainment's open world adaptation at Summer Game Fest this week: climbed around rectangular arrangements of yellow handholds. Shot at baddies over rectangular cover layouts. Collected 7/10 pieces of scrap with some Star Wars flavour text that unlocked an item recipe of some kind. Deployed my chibi Chewbacca sidekick Nix to distract Imperials with cute wiggles and belly boops so I could sneak behind them. Got discovered sneaking behind them and murdered them all before one could run to a terminal and summon reinforcements. OK, maybe that last one is getting there.

I was similarly tickled by the sight of her breathing through a bamboo pipe while swimming underwater, and I emitted a gentle hum of approval, like a smartphone switching on for the very first time, when she impaled a silhouette through a paper door. Respectable shinobing, for sure. Papa Tenchu would be proud.

      <p>When your entire franchise revolves around sneaky assassins lurking in the shadows and running up buildings, it's no surprise fans of the series have been clamoring for a ninja-themed protagonist for years. Assassin's Creed Shadows is the answer to that oft-repeated request, but it's far more than that, thanks to the introduction of a second protagonist, Yasuke the samurai. He's a playable historical figure (a first for the series) and his approach varies wildly from the shinobi protagonist, Naoe. We got a first-hand lo…]]></summary>

      <p>Prince of Persia: The Sands Of Time reemerged during Ubisoft's Forward event, but only slightly. Basically, Ubisoft confirmed the game is still in development, but it won't be releasing until 2026.</p>

<p>The game has hit some development difficulties over to course of its creation. When announced, Ubisoft Pune and Ubisoft Mumbai were said to be developing the game, but in 2022 it was shared that development duties would be handed over to Ubisoft Montreal.

      <p>Ubisoft Forward kicked off with a lengthy gameplay demonstration for Star Wars Outlaws. The open-world scoundrel game shows protagonist Kay Vess, a thief looking to start a new life, trying to hunt down a gunslinger to learn her talents. This takes her from a space station marketplace to Tatooine's iconic Mos Eisley.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 10-minute guided walkthrough focuses on one aspect of Outlaws, which is tracking down elusive experts in order to learn their craft. From being the fastest draw in the galaxy to mastering sleight of hand, these skills will help Kay go from a common (though wanted) thief to a legendary outlaw. The video shows off the seamless ground-to-ship gameplay, one of the optional space dogfights you can engage in, speeder bike gameplay across the sands of Tatooine, as well as stealth and shootout sequences.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you'd like a more condensed summary of what Star Wars Outlaws entails, another trailer serves as a shorter tour through some of the planets players will visit, the characters they'll meet, the systems at play, and a glimpse into some story moments.&nbsp;</p>

The multi-limbed coffee shop owner of Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn is, indeed, a reassuring sight, since they are the ones who sell the player fashionable jackets and trousers to wear while you axe enemy heads to bloody fragments. In this soon-to-sally-forth soulslike from the makers of Ashen, the creature design is a highlight. Whether it's a good souls 'em up remains to be seen. I've only played a couple of hours in the Steam Next Fest demo. But I want to make clear that, among the reservations I've collected on my murder jaunt, nothing will diminish the espresso-pumping hand-haver of the game's first café.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my absolute most favouritest Steam Deck cases, besides the one you get for free with the Steam Deck OLED, is the Dbrand Project Killswitch. It’s not so much a carrying vessel as a hardened second skin, providing protection without all the bag-hogging bulk of a traditional case – while throwing in handy bonuses like a clip-on kickstand and grippy thumbstick covers. For owners of the Asus ROG Ally, the recent launch of a Project Killswitch for their own handheld PC should therefore represent glad tidings with extra gladness, even if it won’t also fit the upcoming ROG Ally X.
Thank the new device’s bigger battery, wider SSD and reworked connection layout for that particular lack of forwards compatibility, as the ROG Ally X’s thicker dimensions will make it just slightly too beefy to slip into the Killswitch’s skintight silicone. A shame, but at least it makes a quality addition to the original Ally right this second. I’ve been manhandling one for a week now, and it’s just as practical and protective as the Steam Deck version.

Then I kick the elevator control panel to pieces, climb out the hatch, and cut the cord with a buzzsaw I smuggled in earlier. "It's also total chaos!" I yell, as the elevator plummets. "Ha ha ha ha ha ha!" Streets of Rogue 2 is looking similarly chaotic. But one thing has been brought to order: its release date. It's coming to early access on August 14th, while a new trailer (below) shows horse riding, flame throwing, and speed boating. My favourite moment is when a man pumps magic gas into a room full of people doing zumba, and it turns them all into giants, and they freak out and start smashing the walls in a panic.

      <p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was one of the brand-new reveals during today's Xbox Game Showcase. Developed by Sandfall Interactive (its debut title), the turn-based RPG unfolds in a fantastical world governed by a powerful figure who wipes out countless innocents every year via a mysterious number.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Clair Obscur's world is at the mercy of the Paintress, who awakens once a year to paint a cursed number on a monolith. That number causes every person of that age to instantly vanish in wisps of smoke. The citizens dealing with this recurring threat know that her next number is "33" and a brave collection of them have one day to mount an expedition to her island to stop her once and for all. However, these "Expeditioners" are merely the latest of dozens of failed attempts at killing the Paintress. Thus, this team will retrace the steps of every squad that came before them as they explore a dreamlike world filled with dangerous threats.</p>

      <p style="margin-bottom:11px">In a press release for the newly announced Winter Burrow, the game is described as a “cozy woodland survival game,” though we have some doubts about the cozy part, given that the tail end of the trailer features the protagonist’s friend being taken away to be eatern by a hungry owl.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:11px">With that said, much of the rest of the game does seem to match an expectation of crafting, baking, resource gathering, and many of the other features you’d expect out of a survival game, albeit with an adorable aesthetic of anthropomorphic mice as the visual style.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:11px">Publisher Noodlecake intends to release the game on Xbox consoles, and PC in early 2025.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:11px">Give a look to the trailer to get a better understanding of how the game plays.</p>

      <p>This month, Dragon Age: The Veilguard (you read that right – Dreadwolf is no more) graces the cover of <em>Game Informer</em>. After years developing Baldur's Gate and its sequel early in its history, BioWare struck out to create its own fantasy RPG. That series began with Dragon Age: Origins in 2009. It was followed up with Dragon Age II in 2011, and then Dragon Age: Inquisition in 2014. While the Dragon Age series' history has its ups and downs, fans have been patiently waiting for BioWare to return to the franchise, and 2024 is finally the yea…]]></summary>

      <p>The next expansion for Fallout 76 is called Skyline Valley and it launches next week. More specifically, Skyline Valley expands the game's map southward to the all-new Shenandoah region on June 12.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There, players will investigate the cause of an electrical storm circling overhead and unveil the mystery around Vault 63. In this mysterious vault, players will meet its dwellers and discover a new Ghoul type called The Lost, too.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Check it out for yourself in the Fallout 76: Skyline Valley trailer below</strong>:&nbsp;</p>

<p>As you can see from the trailer above, the Shenandoah region is not looking so great in post-apocalyptic America. Plus, the trailer also reveals that Fallout 76 players can play as Ghouls starting sometime next year.&nbsp;</p>

The next Gears of War won’t be a sequel like Gears of War 6, but instead looks to be a prequel to the entire series that returns to the very beginning of the bloody battle between humanity and the alien Locust.

      <p>Today, we received an in-depth look at Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, the latest entry in Treyarch's popular, long-running subseries to one of gaming's biggest franchises. As part of that, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2024/06/09/hoping-to-sprint-in-the-right-direction">we learned the series is implementing a new movement system</a>, bringing back round-based Zombies and Classic Prestige, and taking us to the year 1991 for its campaign. We also learned another key piece of information: when we'll be able to play it.</p>

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on October 25. Alongside that, players can expect a campaign that hopes to instill a sense of paranoia and intrigue with the Black Ops team going rogue in order to remove an entity that has infiltrated the highest levels of government, as well as a competitive multiplayer suite that includes 16 all-new maps.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft have released a new trailer for South Of Midnight, a third-person action adventure from Compulsion Games, who created dystopian Britpop survival game We Happy Few. I thought We Happy Few had some wonderful ideas and presentation - it's sort of Fable by way of Clockwork Orange and Bioshock - but found its mixture of pill-popping satire and survival game mechanisms self-defeating. South Of Midnight seems no less vivid, but a lot more assured in its God Of War-style action... and it's perhaps a bit less intriguing, as a consequence. Still, don't just sit there reading my opinions. Watch the trailer.

It does have snow nazis in however, possibly the rarest flavour of Nazi after Cookies n’ Cream and Original. You’ll find the trailer below. Be careful: it’s official. Also, it’s mainly just one very long cutscene, so if you want to save that stuff for when the game’s out, maybe don’t bother.

      <p>Xbox has revealed Gears of War: E-Day, and it's a prequel "origin story" set 14 years before the very first Gears of War game. Revealed during today's Xbox Games Showcase, E-Day stars fan-favorite hero Marcus Fenix and gives players the chance to experience the terror of the infamous Emergence Day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the trailer, which features an orchestral remix of Gary Jules'&nbsp;<em>Mad World&nbsp;</em>(the very same&nbsp;<em>Mad World&nbsp;</em>from the Gears of War launch trailer), we see Marcus and returning hero Dom Santiago come face to face with the Locust Horde. And though we know the Locust Horde quite well, it appears to be Marcus and Dom's first bout with these infamous enemies.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Check it out for yourself in the Gears of War: E-Day reveal trailer below</strong>:&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Experience the brutal horror of Emergence Day through the eyes of Marcus Fenix in the origin story of one of gaming's most acclaimed sagas," the trailer's description reads. "Fourteen years before Gears of War, war heroes Marcus Fenix and Dom Santiago return home to face a new nightmare: the Locust Horde. These subterranean monsters, grotesque and relentless, erupt from below, laying siege on humanity itself."</p>

<p>Xbox says E-Day has been developed from the ground up with Unreal Engine 5 and promises to deliver "unprecedented graphical fidelity."&nbsp;</p>

<p>There's no release date or window for E-Day yet.&nbsp;</p>

      <p style="margin-bottom:11px">The new trailer for Assassin’s Creed Shadows was shown off today at the Xbox Showcase, in which we got a much more comprehensive look and understanding of the gameplay we can expect later this year.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:11px">The video's opening shows off the ninja stealth action players will explore when playing as the shinobi named Naoe, with plenty of rooftop antics and nighttime assaults. The subsequent sequences showcase the samurai Yasuke, a bruiser who can hold his own in a big fight.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:11px">Check out the trailer to see the distinction between the two. Assassin’s Creed Shadows is set to launch on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Mac, on November 15.</p>

      <p>Microsoft has released a new trailer for developer Obsidian Entertainment's <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/avowed">Avowed</a>, and though there's still no release date for the game, this trailer confirms, once more, it's still due out on Xbox Series X/S and PC sometime this year. Revealed during today's Xbox Games Showcase, the new Avowed trailer highlights more of the game's first-person fantasy RPG action, and it continues to look great.&nbsp;</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft and Playground's genuinely long-awaited Fable reboot will launch in 2025, and they've released a new trailer which... seems... good? And is also quite informative about the moment-to-moment of the game. The video is framed as the memoir of a paunchy retired champion, Humphry, who once mentored a young heroine I presume will be the game's main character, though it's ambiguous. She could also be the villain. Then again, Fable is a series in which you can be the villain. Egad, such shenanigans!

      <p>The latest footage of MachineGames' Indiana Jones game showed an extended cutscene, some gameplay clips, and a tease of the first film's boulder run. In the footage we see Jones and a companion coming across a battleship somehow perched on top of an icy mountain. What follows is an extended cutscene where Jones comes face to face with a verbose Nazi who really wants the stone Jones discovered. A punchout ensues and the ship begins to fall before the footage switched to a series of gameplay snippets. Perhaps most exciting, however, was a tease of Indiana Jones outrunning the boulder like he did in the first film. Maybe the Great Circle will feature classic moments from the films?</p>

<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is planned for release this year, but we still don't know the release date.</p>

What's not to like.

      <p>Blizzard Entertainment has released a new trailer for <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/diablo-iv">Diablo IV's</a> upcoming <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/11/06/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-expansion-brings-players-to-a-lush-jungle-biome-late">Vessel of Hatred</a> expansion, and its looks gorgeously horrific. This trailer also reveals the expansion hits Xbox, PlayStation, and PC on October 8.</p>

<p>In the cinematic trailer, we get another look at the terrifying and dark world of Diablo IV by way of Vessel of Hatred's opening cinematic. If you're curious about what to expect, give it a watch – otherwise, it's likely the cinematic that will play at the start of the expansion later this year when Vessel of Hatred hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.</p>

<p><strong>Check it out for yourself in the Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred cinematic below:&nbsp;</strong></p>

      <p style="margin-bottom:11px">We got a first glimpse at the new Life is Strange game at today’s Xbox Showcase. Life is Strange: Double Exposure brings the return of fan-favorite character, Max Caulfield, as she seeks to solve the mystery of her friend’s untimely death.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:11px">The twist is that she experiences that death in one timeline, and her unusual powers allow her to transition into one where the murder didn’t happen, leaving her to try and figure out what happened, and somehow prevent the death in the first place in both timelines.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:11px">The new game comes to us courtesy of Square Enix and Deck Nine Games, and is targeting release on Xbox Series X/S and PC on October 29.</p>

Not miles from the premise of Dragon Age: Inquisition, then. That footage, tho? Not entirely Inquisitiony.

State Of Decay 2, on the other hand, I found to be disappointing - the same game with more money behind it in a way that seemed to magnify its faults. The threequel? I have tempered expectations, but I do want it to be good.

Why does it need to be set in a virtual reality game show? So it can do things like transport players to Kyoto in the year 1568, which is what will happen when season three arrives on June 13th.

The yearly collection of games that may or may not be cosy, but which definitely do not involve stabbing men in the neck, always contains some games worth keeping an eye on. This year was no different, and you'll find the archived stream below.

When that failed to happen, the terms of the injunction seemed to be up for negotiation, at least for a while. Having done little to convince the court that infringement wouldn't continue, DoodStream's operators and associates are now banned from running the site.

Most of them we can't play yet. But as a general rule, talking about games makes us want to play games, even if they're completely unrelated. Everyone has those moments where they see the trailer for a new multiplayer hero shooter or some such thing, and for reasons only known to themselves, they say, "yes, I really must play more Simpsons: Hit And Run." So: here's what we're all clicking on this weekend!

        <updated>2024-06-08T00:51:35.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Computer Artworks' 2002 videogame adaptation of 1982 movie The Thing was a ghoulish and gripping third-person shooter with some terrific mechanics that weren't quite fleshed out, flesh being the operative word. For instance: you can enlist surviving soldiers as squadmates, but are they really surviving soldiers, or are they human-shaped warrens of teeth and mandibles poised to split open and shower you in digestive juices? You have a limited supply of blood tests with which to determine whether any people you rescue are Things in waiting - and even as you're worrying about them, they're casting suspicious eyes at you, care of some embryonic "trust" and "fear" systems.
Sadly, much of this acute paranoia could be easily gamed out in practice - back in 2002, I deduced that contact with enemies increased the odds of infection, and adopted a policy of shooting anyone who'd been in my squad for too long. But it's the kind of system an intelligent remake could pounce upon and have fun with. Sadly, Nightdive are not working on a remake, like their previous System Shock remakes. They've just announced that they're making a remaster, due later this year. Still, I will take a Thing remaster and thus, the opportunity to write more about The Thing, over no remaster at all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A goat or a lamb - which makes the better sacrifice? Trick question, it's neither. The best sacrifices are old rich people. In Cult of the Lamb's next update, Unholy Alliance, you can sacrifice folks with a pal. The upcoming free update will add a co-op goat character so a friend can indoctrinate and stab alongside you. The developers have shown off the two-player update amid the summer news plague that is threatening to tear entire branches off the RPS treehouse this week. "Summoned by blood and born in corruption, this wicked new ally can join the holy Lamb in local co-op," say publishers Devolver. Ah, local co-op. Not online then. I guess this is for real-life people with real-life friends and a proper real-life sofa. Well. Good for them. I'm happy for them. Couldn't be happier. Happy happy happy.

Not least this humongous cube sticking out from the sands of a tropical island at a jaunty angle. It is called the Hexahedron, and its interior constitutes a “large, continuous puzzle cluster” that the player will navigate. As one of those dweebs who has walked around London saying “aha, brutalism” at every insignificant piece of concrete he sees, this pleases me. Come and see it up close in the trailer.

Firstly, this game clearly contains a non-zero quantity of blades, from whacking great axes to katanas. Secondly, I do not accept the premise that these are phantom blades. They are very obviously non-spectral, going by the amount of stabbing and clanging on show in the video. With these potentially ruinous caveats out of the way, I am now free to tell you more about a game that looks like it's out to eat Sekiro's lunch.
