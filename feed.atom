        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lethal Company developer Zeekerss released the Patch Notes and update for Version 64 of the popular survival game today, indicating that while the patch is a smaller one, he wanted to get it out as soon as possible because it has a couple of nice features. Here are all the details we know about about Lethal Company Version 64 and the Patch Notes for the update titled The Bag Patch.





Lethal Company Update 64 Patch Notes


Compared to previous updates, Version 64 for Lethal Company is a rather small update. However, as Zeekerss mentioned, it does have some pretty important additions such as a new item, a new rare weather event, and a ton of bug fixes. According to Zeekerss, he's been spending a lot of time working on another project, titled Welcome to the Dark Place, with hopes of finishing it soon.


The last two versions were mostly bug fixes, and so is Version 64, but with at least two new pieces of content, it's a great update for Lethal Company fans to get back into it. Here are the full Lethal Company Version 64 Patch Notes, for the update titled The Bag Patch:



New Tactical Belt Bag - The tactical belt bag can now be bought from the terminal. It holds 15 non-scrap items and can be accessed by other players while it's around your waist. Use "INFO" to learn more about it.


Rare Weather Event - A new, rare 0.6% chance weather event can now occur on any day at a random time.


Bug Fixes - A few bug fixes.



While Zeekerss didn't go into detail about the bug fixes, it's typically changes that overall improve the quality of the game by fixing the rare bug or issue that may occur when playing Lethal Company. The Version 64 update is live now on PC via Steam.

We even wanted to replay a lot of what we’d already done because we knew there were other ways we could have done things, and because the game doesn’t really care how you solve something as long as you solve it."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Winged Keys are one of the common currencies in Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions that you can earn in several ways and they help you unlock different characters, wands, broom trails, and more.


Unlike the Firebolt, you need these Winged Keys to unlock certain iconic characters from Harry Potter movies such as Draco Malfoy and Cedric Diggory. They cost a certain amount and earning this currency is not as easy as earning Gold and Moonstones.


Fortunately, there are a handful of ways to earn Winged Keys, and here's how you can do that.

How to earn Winged Keys Quidditch Champions


There are two ways of earning Winged Keys:



Complete Daily and Weekly Challenges


Reach different milestones in Seasonal events



Completing Daily challenges such as playing five PvP matches, winning a game, completing assists, or more can fetch you 2 to 3 Winged Keys. Weekly challenges on the other hand take longer to complete and reward you with 7 to 10 Winged Keys.


The current Season has several milestones and reaching at least level 50 will get you 100 Winged Keys in total. You can continue leveling up; each level beyond 50 will give you 10 of this currency.


Screenshot by Destructoid


How to use Winged Keys in Quidditch Champions


Once you have enough Winged Keys stacked up, you can head to The Vault under Market to spend them on characters such as Draco Malfoy, Cedric Diggory, Ginny Weasley, and Cho Chang. They are known as the Heroes of Hogwarts and each of their bundles cost 250x Winged Keys.


These characters have their dedicated bundles in the store which also offer other items such as styled wands, house-wise goal celebrations, and colored broom trails.


Winged Keys are the enchanted Flying Keys you've read in Harry Potter: Philosopher's Stone. Just like the series, Winged Keys are equally rare to get in Quidditch Champions, and have many uses we've mentioned above.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Carrier AI Fragment is an interactive component in No Man’s Sky, which is primarily used to detect crashed Sentinel Interceptors in the game. Players can find Carrier AI Fragment in No Man’s Sky through a variety of ways.


However, the method which guarantees Carrier AI Fragment is go after the Sentinel Capital Ships, and destroy them. A Sentinel Capital Ship is the last sentinel force sent against the player when they’re fighting sentinels in space. A Sentinel Capital Ship arrives at a level 5 wanted level. This freighter comes with regular Sentinel Interceptors to defeat the player.





You have to damage the hull of the freighter and destroy it, which will also cause nearby Sentinel Interceptors to retreat. You will receive the Carrier AI Fragment among other items as loot for defeating the Sentinel Capital Ship.


There are also other ways in No Man’s Sky where you might stumble upon a Carrier AI Fragment, but the chances are slim. Nexus missions can sometimes offer Carrier AI Fragment as reward for completing a task. You might also receive Carrier AI Fragment as loot from successful combat frigate expeditions.


Video via Hello Games


Regardless, the chances for both of these scenarios are slim, so if you are specifically looking for Carrier AI Fragment, your guaranteed way of obtaining it is by defeating the Sentinel Capital Ship.


Defeating Sentinel Interceptors, then the Sentinel Capital Ship is not as easy task to accomplish, so make sure your starship is equipped with enough shields and weapons technology upgrades to aid you well in battle. It’s best to equip a starship with maneuverability and upgrade it with technology and weapons, as large inventory ships move and turn way slower than sleek, combat ships.

Granted, a toggle to drop the UI isn't exactly innovation defined. But it should increase the spooky immersion of the horror game.


Bloober revealed the options earlier today on its social media channels. I'll be the first to say that the tiny screens on X/Twitter and Instagram don't really do the footage much justice. But take it from someone who spent the last 40 seconds with their face against the monitor, the filter does give the video an eerie quality. Or maybe that's just the poor encoder?

Following the latest round of industry whispers about this anticipated device, "industry insider" Nate the Hate is now claiming this new device "has backwards compatibility support". This latest update (via VGC) follows similar backwards compatibility claims from peripheral maker Mobapad earlier this year.

You might not expect to have a huge variety of customization options for your character in Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2, but it fits the universe incredibly well. Think about it. Warhammer 40K is a tabletop game that's just as much about customizing your miniatures as it is about actually playing against others using the armies you've made.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sprayfeather Gill in Genshin Impact is an ascension item that can help Mualani level up. It's a beautiful Natlan flower that can be picked up throughout the African-inspired nation. 


Sprayfeather Gill Genshin Impact location


You'll find the majority of the Sprayfeather Gills in Genshin Impact by visiting the Ameyalco Waters area in Natlan. It's in the northern section of the Toyac Springs region.


Screenshot via Appsample


The Sprayfeather Gill grows near the water. Look at the shrubs and rocks within this area, and you'll spot the blue and orange plant that's, in fact, taller than Bennett. 


How many Sprayfeather Gills do you need to ascend Mualani?


To ascend Mualani to her max level, you'll require 168 Sprayfeather Gill. Additionally, you'll need a grand total of 46 Mark of the Binding Blessing that can be gained by taking down the Holawaqa Ngoubou boss. 420,000 Mora is also needed to get to her maximum level, which can be gained in multiple ways.


Screenshot by Destructoid


To get Mora in Genshin Impact, you can use promo codes, redeem a special PlayStation Plus-exclusive pack, finish quests, and have characters complete expeditions with the Adventurer's Guild. You can also get your Daily Commission Rewards finished. 


You'll also need the following materials to fully level up Mualani:



1 Varunda Lazurite Sliver


9 Varunda Lazurite Chunk


9 Varunda Lazurite Fragment


6 Varunda Lazurite Gemstone


18 Sentry's Wooden Whistle


36 Saurian-Crowned Warrior's Golden Whistle


30 Warrior's Metal Whistle



The whistles drop from many different Saurian-Crowned Warriors across Natlan. Varunda Lazurite materials can be gathered from a bunch of different bosses, such as the Hydro Hypostasis from Inazuma and Rhodeia of Loch from Liyue

The DLC first came out in 2019. As it is licensed content from the movie, its days were always numbered, and it looks like those days amounted to (a bit over) five years. Still, a little more notice would have been appreciated.


The Ghostbusters DLC features decorations and rides based on the film franchise. The Ghostbusters Experience ride also includes a sort of interactive mini-game. There’s also a “narrative” campaign featuring the voice of Dan Aykroyd and William Atherton (Who? Oh, Peck!). It was praised as being a fairly robust expansion, whereas other licensed DLC for the game were more cosmetic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Once you enter the endgame of Black Myth: Wukong, you might want to pay attention to the Bull King Iron Horn resource. Getting one of the better sets in the game will be important. 


Here’s what you need to know about the item and how to get it.


How to get the Bull King Iron Horn in Black Myth: Wukong


To get the Bull King Iron Horn in Black Myth: Wukong, you have to beat the boss, Bishui Golden-Eyed Beast, in the secret area of Chapter 5. This area can be accessed in this chapter while doing the Pale-Axe Stalwart’s quest.


Once you can start crafting Mythical level gear, you’ll see that this item will be necessary for crafting the Bull King’s set, which grants you the Unyielding Resolve set bonus.


It should be noted that you can only obtain four units of this resource per story playthrough. If you want to craft the whole set, you need to go into New Game Plus and defeat the Bishui Golden-Eyed Beast again. 


At most, you can only craft three of the four pieces of the set in one run. However, there are incentives to run the game again as you’ll unlock additional gear to use in the second playthrough.

Additional uses for the Bull King Iron Horn


Not only will you be able to get an additional four units of this crafting item, but you’ll also unlock the Dark Iron Staff. This Mythical weapon comes from the Cloud-Patterned Stone Staff upgrade tree and will also require the Bull King Iron Horn. 


While not directly part of the set, its unique effect coincides with the armor’s stats. It’ll “considerably” increase your damage based on how much defense you have. So, with the high defense stat the Bull King set has, this weapon is the perfect match for it. 


Now with a full set and potentially the staff to go with it, you can take on the next level of New Game Plus and see how strong this setup can get.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Normally, as you're playing Fortnite, you want to avoid taking damage and eliminate others to get a victory royale. However, finishing quests occasionally requires inflicting and taking damage from specific sources. Let's find out where you can find some fire.


Where to find fire in Fortnite


The easiest way to create a fire is by visiting any gas station and blowing up the gas pumps. While you'd typically use gas pumps to refuel your car, letting them explode causes fire on the ground, allowing you to step in it and take damage for your quests.


Screenshot by Destructoid


You'll find gas stations all around Fortnite, particularly surrounding major POIs. My go-to is one directly southwest of Doomstadt, but it'll mostly depend on personal preference and the circumstances of your current match.


Just be careful while doing this, as the explosion will cause a significant amount of damage to your character. Gather some shields beforehand and keep your health high to make sure you don't eliminate yourself during this process. You can damage gas pumps using guns to maintain a safe distance from the blast or use a pickaxe and quickly run away if you have no other options.


A fire will appear on the ground once you cause a gas pump to explode. Stepping in this will damage you, completing any quests related to it. Like before, you'll want to make sure you have high health and shields so the fire doesn't kill you instantly. It doesn't do a ton of damage, but it can still give you a disadvantage against any incoming players.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every TCG evolves over time, and Flesh & Blood is no exception. Ahead of the game's fifth anniversary and the release of the Rosetta set, the creators wanted to share the most updated banned and restricted card lists so that everything else can be enjoyed to the fullest. 


Bans and restrictions aren't put in place in Flesh & Blood to bring the game's meta back to what it was. They're used to help keep the game fair and remove damaging combos that might compromise the game's integrity or just not be fun to play with or against. It's important to continuously change the game because the player base can find those making the game can't because they see it through a different lens. That's why the following bans and restrictions have been brought into place from September 4, 2024.

        <updated>2024-09-04T19:09:17.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some recent Destiny rumors have been corroborated by reputable industry sources that allege a mobile entry for the franchise, reportedly called Destiny Rising, is currently being worked on by Chinese developer NetEase. While details on the project remain scarce, prominent insiders like Jeff Grubb have commented on its existence and seemingly confirmed that it's still being worked on.


This news comes in the wake of some turmoil at Bungie. At the end of July, the company had its second round of layoffs within a year, with additional employees getting integrated into Sony. Since then, conversations about the studio's mismanagement have coalesced alongside high-ranking departures and scandals.


Previous reporting from Bloomberg and Forbes indicated that a Destiny mobile game may have been among the projects canceled alongside project Payback. However, more recently, The Game Post reported that notable insider Kurakasis posted on X, formerly Twitter, saying, "Destiny Rising is the title of an unannounced Destiny mobile game being developed by NetEase and Bungie[.] It has not been canceled."


The info was seemingly backed up by another insider, Jeff Grubb, who made a comment about the post on Threads. Grubb wrote, "Yeah, this is real. Not a lot of people from Bungie working on it. It could get announced soon." When pressed for further details in the comments, Grubb talked about gameplay, saying, "It's going to be Destiny on mobile, but with a lot of changes. Hero characters instead of building your own character, for example."


While this new information comes from reputable sources in the industry, it should be taken with a grain of salt. Bungie has not announced Destiny Rising or any Destiny mobile project in any official capacity, and plans can always change.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thundering Fury is a powerful item in Type Soul (in Roblox) that can imbue your character with electricity and enable some powerful attacks. Its use is pretty simple, but how to get it is less straightforward.


Where to get Thundering Fury in Type Soul


To get Thundering Fury in Type Soul you’re going to need to go to AFK World. I have heard at least one other person say they got it as a Clan Wars review, but the only place I know of from my experience is AFK World.


However, to get to AFK World you need to get a World Ticket. That is totally something you can get from Clan Wars. World Tickets can also be bought, redeemed from a code, or won in ranked matches. Once you use a World Ticket the AFK World option will unlock on the main menu, and you can enter.


AFK World rewards you for… being AFK. Away-from-keyboard, that is. As you wait, every so often (every hour, it seems), it will drop a random item for you. You can increase this by winning PVP battles, which increases your Soulian Streak. The higher your Soulian Streak, the higher the drop rate. However, anyone can attack you once you enter the PVP arena, so if you want to maintain it you need to either hide or protect yourself, which kind of defeats the purpose of AFK World, but I digress.


Wait around long enough, and you may come into possession of Thundering Fury. It’s a very rare drop, so you may have to leave your game running for quite a long time.


How to use Thundering Fury in Type Soul


Using Thundering Fury in Type Soul is pretty straightforward. You set it to one of your quick key slots, then activate it. Your character will erupt into an aura of lightning, signifying it’s active. The item isn’t used up upon activation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are a series of quest chains in Hallowfall that result in you receiving a Wooden Figure, an object with no easily discernible use or purpose. However, it's actually used as part of another quest, and ultimately part of the Lost and Found achievement. Here is where to find and turn in the Wooden Figure in WoW The War Within.


Screenshot by Destructoid


How to get the Wooden Figure


You will receive the Wooden Figure item as a quest reward for completing the Time Borrowed quest from Maera Ashyld in Hallowfall. In fact, she will give you three items: a Calcified Journal, a Wooden Figure, and a Sturdy Locket. All of these items pertain to various local quests that will earn you the Lost and Found achievement.


In order to pick up the Time Borrowed quest, you will need to complete the Memories of the Sky quest chain with Maera Ashyld, which is unfortunately locked behind two weekly reset timegates. This means the first time you can actually pick up and do the Time Borrowed quest is on September 3, 2024, as long as you have been completing all the previous quests each week you can.


Next, you need to get 6 Mementos for Maera by farming the mobs around the area. Once you've gotten all 6, turn them into Marea who lets you keep three, including the Wooden Figure.


Where to turn in the Wooden Figure in The War Within


Now that you've got your hands on the Wooden Figure, you can use it to get the quest properly titled, well, Wooden Figure. You must then take the Wooden Figure to the NPC Barahl Lynflayme, located in the area called Dunelle's Kindness in Hallowfall.


Handing it over to Barahl will complete the quest and earn you progress toward the Lost and Found achievement. If this was the last step of the achievement for you, you will also receive the Sandy Quotidian Wear cosmetic ensemble appearance for completing the achievement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2 is right around the corner, promising beautifully grim landscapes, more than enough tyranids to slaughter, and guns. Lots of guns. Before you can get to slaughtering for the Emperor, however, you'll need to decide which edition of the game you want. Here's which Space Marine 2 edition you should buy, depending on your launch day plans. 


What does each Space Marine 2 edition give?


Space Marine 2 sports four separate editions: Standard, Gold, Ultra, and Collector's. Each offers something more than the previous edition, increasing in cost as a consequence. Here's what each edition brings to the table:



Standard Edition - $59.99

Macragge's Chosen DLC (if preordered)


Base Game




Gold Edition - $89.99

Both Standard Edition rewards

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Silent Hill 2 PC system requirements are pretty beefy, and for a seemingly gorgeous horror game like this, it makes sense. Publisher Konami recommends that you have an SSD and at least 16GB of RAM for both minimum and recommended specs lists.

Silent Hill 2 PC minimum system requirements


Silent Hill 2 will be pushing some impressive current-gen visuals on your PC. This means you'll need the following specs to play the game on Low or Medium settings at 1080p, according to Silent Hill 2's Steam listing.



OS: Windows 10 x64


Processor: Intel Core i7-6700K | AMD Ryzen 5 3600


Memory: 16 GB RAM


Graphics: NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 1070 Ti or AMD Radeon™ RX 5700


DirectX: Version 12


Storage: 50 GB available space



These specs will also have you running Silent Hill 2 at 30 frames per second at Low or Medium. With this in mind, it may be time for you to upgrade your computer's specs before trying to play this horror remake. Is this spooking you to go to Best Buy or Amazon right now? Thankfully, you won't need as much storage as games like Starfield (125GB) and Horizon: Forbidden West (150GB).  


Image via Konami


Silent Hill 2 recommended specs


To play the game at 1080p (or up-rezzed 4K with DLSS) on Medium settings (with 60 FPS) or High settings (with 30 FPS), you'll need the following:



OS: Windows 10 x64


Processor: Intel Core i7-8700K | AMD Ryzen 5 3600X


Memory: 16 GB RAM


Graphics: NVIDIA® GeForce® 2080RTX or AMD Radeon™ 6800XT


DirectX: Version 12


Storage: 50 GB available space



Hopefully, the way to play Silent Hill 2 on your PC won't be too foggy, but at least the high end settings aren't as bad as they could be, considering some of the demands of other current-gen games out there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No Man’s Sky Expedition 15: Aquarius is the first Expedition in the game's history based around fishing. Players have wanted this mechanic in the game for a long time, so it made sense for the Expedition to kick off as soon as the update with the activity was added. 


The Aquarius update for No Man's Sky was released on September 4, 2024, and the Expedition hit the game on the same day. While there's no need to speedrun it, Expeditions are only ever live for a limited amount of time, so it's worth completing every Milestone and Phase while you have the chance and without rushing. After all, fishing is meant to be relaxing, but quests can make anything stressful if you don't know how to complete them.

We didn't write about it at the time, because I suppose re-writing the very fabric of the galaxy seemed small-time.

Today's new update, however, adds fishing, and I can't not write about that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Cole Palmer Make Your Mark item is one of the most fun cards I have played with in EA FC 24. Not everyone scored the card back at its debut, but now you've got a second chance to recruit Palmer for yourself. 


I was thrilled to get the card when it was released as part of the Make Your Mark promo back in Season 7. If you didn't have that same luck, Season 9 has some good news for free. You can unlock this card, and the Ferland Mendy Make Your Mark, for free by completing the latest objective set. 


EA FC 24 Pre-Season Draft Play objective rewards


The Pre-Season Draft Play objective revolves around the Draft mode of EA FC 24. You'll need to spend FC Points, coins, or Draft tokens to play. You can obtain a unique token on a daily basis in Ultimate Team. Use them to complete all the objectives, adding two special cards to your squad. 



Play 1: Play 1 match in any Ultimate Team game mode.


Play 1 Draft: Play 1 Ultimate Team Draft match.


Play 2 Draft: Play 2 Ultimate Team Draft matches.


Play 4 Draft: Play 4 Ultimate Team Draft matches.


Play 6 Draft: Play 6 Ultimate Team Draft matches.


Play 10 Draft: Play 10 Ultimate Team Draft matches.


Win 3 Draft: Win 3 Ultimate Team Draft matches.


Win 5 Draft: Win 5 Ultimate Team Draft matches.


Win 8 Draft: Win 8 Ultimate Team Draft matches.


Win 3 Online: Win 3 Ultimate Team Draft matches.


Win 8 Online: Win 8 Ultimate Team Draft matches.



Here's what you need to get the two Make Your Mark cards that are part of this objective set in EA FC 24. 



Ferland Mendy: Play 10 Ultimate Team Draft Matches. 


Cole Palmer: Complete all 11 tasks as it's the group reward. 



It's pretty easy to complete the objectives, and you won't even have to spend any coins. Both cards can do well even in this endgame season, and the grind is certainly worth your efforts.

Add onto that, "Blops 6" will be available on Xbox Game Pass at launch, and you've got yourself an unstoppable profit-making formula right there. But what if you aren't planning on playing the game on console? What if you have aspirations of getting your military-based FPS on via PC, or better yet, on the move with a Steam Deck?

Pre-orders for The Legend of Zelda - The Complete Series went live on Amazon over the weekend (via @VideoArtGame) — we're honestly not sure how we missed it — and the rerelease will be out on 22nd October 2024. Should give you plenty of time to finish Echoes of Wisdom then, right?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nikhil Murthy's Syphilisation is a "postcolonial 4X game", which might sound like a contradiction in terms. While approaches to 4X and grand strategy vary hugely between games, factions and players, the genre as a whole is firmly wedded to imperial conquest, both structurally and at the level of narrative aspects and set-dressing. Many 4X games are triumphal re-enactments of specific periods of colonial settlement and expansion. All of which is to say that Syphilisation is fascinating. It's a reworking of the genre which dismantles and reconstructs concepts such as diplomacy, research and production. It's also just left early access - find more details and a playthrough video below.

And while we're still waiting for a specific release date, hands-on previews for the game have dropped and given us some new information.
One of the coolest features of the game was highlighted in PlayStation Blog's impressions — a customisable soundtrack that harks back to Sakaguchi and composer Nobuo Uematsu's past. Yep, you'll be able to select Final Fantasy songs and listen to them while you're in combat. Very, very cool.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been 13 years since the first Space Marine came out. While it wasn't outstanding in the grander landscape of gaming, enough Warhammer 40K fans seem to have cherished the escapades of bulky blue boltgunner Demetrian Titus for the action game to merit a sequel a decade later. It left its story on something of a cliffhanger, with said hero being dragged away to face untold tortures by the Inquisition, the most zealous sect of this preternaturally paranoid sci-fi universe. Today, Titus is free again. Free to stomp towards hordes of alien foes, blast them with a plasma incinerator, and shred the stragglers with a chainsaw sword. Space Marine 2 is an often-satisfying scrapper that has me  convinced of 40K's merit as a crafting ground for excellent-looking environments and creatures, even if I'm not particularly moved by the bland character of Titus and his fellow Ultramarines.

We are mere weeks away from the release of The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom on 26th September and just to get the excitement levels even higher, we have a crisp 15 minutes of brand-new gameplay footage to share with you.
The above footage comes from our recent trip to a hands-on event, where we got to play through the opening section of Echoes of Wisdom and see all its new features in action. The gameplay sees Zelda exploring some of the game's early locales, taking on monsters and solving puzzles with the handy Echoes tool — something we'll be heavily reliant on for the rest of the game, we'd wager.

Quick disclosure: I worked with Mojang and Microsoft on a book about Minecraft's first 15 years, shortly before joining Rock Paper Shotgun. As such, I am now obliged by the eternal laws of journalistic accountability to state that anything Minecraft-related is rubbish. But even if that weren't the case, I would describe this as pretty dismal.

Listen. If you're fed up with roguelikes, deck-builders and the like, we feel you. In the indie sphere in particular, there are an awful lot of games in these genres right now, enough to have us auto-glaze over anytime we see the words mentioned, and even though there are plenty of good 'uns, it does get a little tired. So it's great when examples, like Robatino's Shogun Showdown, pop up every now and again to remind us that there's still gold in them there hills. Thanks.
So, why is Shogun Showdown so special, you ask? Well, it's one of those rarefied experiences that make you feel a special sort of stupid. It's what all the very best games do. Alongside your Darkest Dungeons' and your Into the Breaches, this is right up there with the cream of recent crops.

Releasing in cinemas on 4th April 2025, the film sees a group of ordinary humans (played by Jason Mamoa, Sebastian Eugene Hansen, Emma Myres and Danielle Brooks) pulled into Mojang's blocky world thanks to a mysterious portal. There, they meet "expert crafter" Jack Black sorry, Steve, who will have to help them make their way home.

Now, thanks to a few social media posts circulating from key industry figures, rumours of a potential 'Switch 2' reveal (or at least something Switch 2-related) happening this month are beginning to swiftly gather pace. The first comes from Gameindustry.biz's Chris Dring, who posted a tweet that simply states "With industry whispers around ‘something’ Switch 2-related happening this month, I thought I’d remind everyone of the official list of the greatest games consoles of all time" (it's the Switch, of course, but that's not the important thing here.

But the real test to see if all this non-swordy-style gameplay could actually work is actually playing it. Thankfully, Nintendo graciously invited us to do just that, so we’re the experts on the matter now. Accept no substitutes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wario would be proud.
Nintendo’s Wario Land series has always occupied a unique niche in the company’s extensive catalogue with its weird humour and unconventional approach to platforming tropes, which is why fans have been greatly let down by the fact that there hasn’t been a new entry in over 15 years. To fill the gap, an indie team called Tour De Pizza came out early last year with its own spiritual successor called Pizza Tower, offering a polished and thrilling adventure into a truly insane food-themed world. Since release, Pizza Tower has quickly built up a high reputation for its creativity and gameplay design, and now that it’s come to Switch, we’re pleased to report that it is indeed a fantastic platformer.
Pizza Tower places you in the role of Peppino Spaghetti, the chef and owner of a failing pizzeria who finds himself threatened by an evil sentient pizza named Pizzaface who lives nearby in the titular tower. Pizzaface has a laser on top of the tower which he’s going to use to destroy Peppino’s pizzeria, so our daring chef dashes off to climb the tower and destroy the evil pizza and his minions once and for all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Babbdi was a game of stark and severe Brutalist aesthetics, and also, a game about playing scales with a trumpet, walljumping with a baseball bat and using a leafblower to fly. Snuck out over winter 2022, it was a sombre but delightful freebie with immense though well-hidden imagination, in which your only explicit objective was to find a way out of a small concrete city.
Now, developers Lemaitre Bros are making a gott-dang 1v1 FPS called Straftat, slated for release on 24th October 2024 with over 100 arenas. It's similarly in love with concrete, but it also has blunderbusses, dual-wielding, Gatling guns, corner-peeking, curved swords, cowboy hats and beehive hairdos.

Deliver At All Costs is a chaotic courier sim set in those heady days that sees the player barrelling around a "semi-open" US town as they take on absurd odd jobs. "From delivering a giant flailing Marlin, to the disposal of an atomic bomb teetering on the edge of explosion," say the developers, "always expect the unexpected." It's maybe best understood by witnessing the moment in the trailer below where the player drifts right through a menswear store, bringing the whole building down. Yep, that looks like a good time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When it comes to the Rust programming language support within the Linux kernel one of the limitations is that the CPU architecture support isn't as widespread. Currently Rust for Linux supports x86_64, AArch64 (ARM64) little-endian, LoongArch, and RISC-V. While those cover the main targets, POWER is notably missing and many other niche CPU architectures supported by the Linux kernel especially for aging platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ač to podle počasí nevypadá, prázdniny skončily. Nesmutněte však, neboť již tento čtvrtek bude Virtuální Bastlírna - setkání elektroniků, bastlířů, ajťáků a všech milovníků techniky! Jaké novinky a témata tam čekají? Nový procesor na trhu zpravidla vzruší jen uživatele PC, největší novinka tohoto měsíce se týká spíše bastlířů. Raspberry vydalo nový procesor RP2350, který je výrazným vylepšením původního RP2040. Kromě Arm Cortex M33 jader skrývá také RISC-V jádra a značné množství zajímavých digitálních periferií. Ač oficiální desky ještě nejsou dostupné, samozřejmě se strahovákům procesor i tak dostal do rukou a možná i do hledáčku elektronových mikroskopů. A poví si i proč má nový Bus Pirate s tímto procesorem lehké trable a jaké zajímavosti se nachází v erratě procesoru.

Tím samozřejmě novinky nekončí - ještě se bastlíři zmíní o novém nativním konfiguračním nástroji pro síťové prvky od Mikrotiku a o podpoře jednovrstvých plošných spojů v Altiu. Protože jsou ale bastlíři, nezapomenou i na čistě hardwarová témata.

Ze světa hardwaru ukáží nejen novinky nebo praktické poznatky ohledně minimalistických sad nářadí, které se dají vždy nosit s sebou, ale i pár lehce "retro" projektů. Vznikla například replika klávesnice k počítači Ondra a ke starým osciloskopům se dá v současnosti koupit emulátor disketové mechaniky, který používá standardní USB flash disky.

A jak je zvykem, mají strahováci nachystaná i obskurní až bizarní témata, kupříkladu simulátor 555 na Attiny, čínské klony karet MIFARE Classic s nedokumentovaným backdoorem nebo velice osobité útržky z legendární knihy Rozeberte si PC.

Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat ve čtvrtek 5. září od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.]]></summary>

Two years later, the defendants are paying a heavy price and the main case hasn't even started.

Hot off the back of the Borderlands movie's whimpering performance at the box office and a disastrous launch of Risk of Rain 2's 'Seekers of the Storm' DLC, Gearbox founder Randy Pitchford has finally spoken up about the company's success rate on Twitter (thanks, PC Gamer). Unfortunately, he has done so by comparing the company's output to... The Beatles. Oh boy.
Celebrating Seekers of the Storm hitting the top of the Steam charts, Pitchford was called out on Twitter by @RealBrodohub for his recent "judgment and shot calling ability" — a reference to both the movie's box office failure and the DLC's buggy launch after Gearbox brought the series rights from original developer Hopoo Games.

Alongside a global release time map (or two maps, technically, since they’re pulling that pay-more-to-play-early nonsense), there’s a big Q&A covering all your burning questions about burning 'nids. Among these is a confirmation that, no, the action game won’t be implementing DRM software such as Denuvo.

Parcel Corps is a light-hearted bicycle courier sim set in a colourful totalitarian regime where the police do not like things to be delivered in time, or at all. Perhaps that's why the game, which was due to arrive on Steam tomorrow, has been delayed until an unspecified date. That's okay, half the news stories we write seem to be about release setbacks. At least the developers announced the delay in a funny and thematically appropriate way.

To shreds, I say - it’s currently sitting at 79% ‘mostly negative’ rating on Steam. Among the chief complaints are…uh, everything, it looks like. The DLC is reportedly so bug-ridden that it’s taken many of the base game’s core systems down with it.
Gearbox - who acquired Risk Of Rain from Hopoo Games in 2022 - have since put out a blog with a list of known issues they’re targeting, and encourage players to keep submitting bug reports. Among the listed issues are a boss named Mithrix becoming invincible (“definitely not intentional”), and “an issue that allowed players to get stuck while smelling the flowers”.

Throughout the chaos, the Maw simply grins, although it does seem to have a few more seeds betwixt its teeth than last week. Perhaps the Maw will deign to spit a single seed at us, from which we can grow the sapling of a new world and finally abandon this cursed, Medium Loafless existence. Until then, here are this week’s PC game releases of note.

Instead, I had one of the worst flu illnesses I've ever had, followed by a nice bout of tonsillitis, for which I'm still on antibiotics. Thankfully, I can now look at a monitor screen for more than an hour before feeling sick, so gaming is no longer out of the question for this weekend.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the first post for my series on "saving" open world design, I complained that many of today's open worlds feel like checklists of formulaic tasks and rewards, their geography a vaporous staging ground for itemisable, cycling content-gathering opportunities, which flies in the face of the sense of freedom and wonder they're supposed to inspire. My interviewees, Elder Scrolls veterans Matt Firor and Nate Purkeypile, argued that this reflects the expense and scale of today's open world productions, which constrains experimental design both at a practical level and in terms of overall direction.
CD Projekt open world designer Jakub Tomczak doesn't, as far as I know, have an answer to the issue of production bloat, but he does have a disarmingly obvious solution to the 'checklist problem', based on his time creating missions for Cyberpunk 2077 and its Phantom Liberty expansion: get better at hiding the checklist. Weave it into the landscape and setting more artfully, with an elegant balance of randomisation and responsiveness to the player's behaviour which keeps everything fresh.

Since that reveal developers Fun Dog Studios have mostly been sending out small "burst transmissions" - essentially footage from the hellfront - like this patriotic beheading and some panicked gunfights. But today they've made a longer video revealing an early access release date. And - oh! - it's quite soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I won an awful board game from Nickelodeon once. I say “won”. Actually, I got disconnected phoning into a competition line after I’d gotten through, got upset loudly, my mum called them to complain, they fast tracked me to the next competition thing, I got the quiz answer wrong, and the presenter pretended he’d heard the right answer and pulled a prize out of the big prize bucket. It was a copy of The Game of Life, possibly the least exciting board game a child can win.
The game was dog water, and there’s probably a lesson in there somewhere about how cool and good it is to whine until you get free things, but we don’t have time for that. Instead, I’d like to draw your attention to Floops Big House Adventure. It’s a grungy, slimy, Aaahh!!! Real Monsters meets Ren and Stimpy Saturday morning shooter. Some of you will already hate it from the header screenshot, I imagine. Personally, the art drew me right in.

It’ll set you back $25, £20 or €25, and my drive-by analysis of the trailer below is that they've done a decent job with the ports.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first time I encountered Jack King-Spooner's work, it was when he sent me a copy of Sluggish Morss: Pattern Circus over hospital wifi late at night. The game was a bright spot in a bad time, which might seem peculiar given that Sluggish Morss often looks like a whale's upset stomach, but it's such a feverishly inventive creation. It blew the dust from my synapses.
The same appears true of King-Spooner's upcoming Judero, on which he is collaborating with Soul Searching developer Talha Kaya. It casts you as a "pagan seer" armed with a big stick, who is searching the mythical Scottish borderlands for evil creatures to clobber. It looks cheerier and airier than Sluggish Morss, with a more overt emphasis on mechanics such as combat, but it has the same pickled 3am energy to it. It's also now got a release date - 16th September - and a new trailer below.

In parallel, the Vietnamese Government is organizing a promo tour in Hollywood.

The solution: Deathsprint 66 is getting a set of PvE-focussed "Episodes" in which just one human player plus optional bots hurtle through the spiked and bladed contours of a futuristic megacity.

The opening radio chat between starting squad member Sid and a pal has that telltale charming tinge of overeager cockney. It also contains the words “bloody” and “arse” in quick succession, though thankfully not next to each other. The only piles are the logs Sid’s crouched behind as he prepares to sneak up to a cable car guarded by Nazis. That is the only haemorrhoids allusion I will ever make on this website. Until the next time I have to write about Andrew Wilson.
“Oil just use my trusty knoife” mutters Sid as I take down my first guard. Straight away, the animation and noise indicators evoke the same Shadow Tactics or Desperados III goodness you’re probably expecting. Fine with me - that’s exactly what I’m here for. Mimimi’s closing was a real gutpunch, and while I don’t expect anyone to match their exceptional work any time soon, it’s at least reassuring to see Warsaw studio Artificer picking up the torch.

It seems there was more to that story than concern about the progress of Marathon. According to a new Bloomberg report citing anonymous sources, Barrett was in fact fired this spring after he was accused by several female Bungie staff of inappropriate behaviour.

Please let it still be under 40 – and realise with alarm that, by extrapolation, a lot of the people reading this probably have children. Augh, children! Please excuse me while I go stand on a chair, clutching a broom. I’ve never understood the craze for generating smaller versions of yourself. It’s one of those weirder subcultures you read about in the papers, but rarely observe in daily life. 


I do, however, understand the appeal of same-screen co-op games like Run From Mummies - which, being a bloodless comedy dungeon romp, seems like a fair pick for those encumbered with boisterous selfspawn. Don’t worry, the “mummies” of the title are just regular old disembowelled corpses wrapped in cloth, not those sinister, non-embalmed “mothers” you’ve been hearing about down the grocers.

When ten citizens dropped dead on the roads of one of my settlements in post-apocalyptic city builder Endzone 2, I had to work fast to avoid a sickness breaking out. But graveyards require a lot of space, and if you've already filled your shanty town with a sea of corrugated metal roofs, this poses a problem. Welcome to the pleasant headache of town planning in a post-nuclear world, where most of the land is brown and uninhabitable.

While it's not quite as chaotic and entangled as say, Disgaea, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is one of those games. I'd call it "baroque", but that would be out of synch with developer Sandfall Interactive's stated influences: the new RPG takes place in a molten and fragmented fantasy world based on the Belle Époque or "beautiful era" of late 19th century France. Your job as player is to stop a sorcerous Paintress from painting everybody over a certain age out of existence. We'll circle back to the plot, though. First, the excessively ornate battlin'.

It's a free-to-play game, but has a business model that makes you feel like you're getting a rougher deal than if you just dropped thirty notes for it outright. It's available now in Early Access, but has already been available in a kind of gravity-defying Super Early Access for several weeks (which you had to pay to get into).


All of which has made me feel very tired, and yearn for the days when you went into a shop and bought a game in a box for a set amount of money, and the whole game was in the box and you went home and put it on your PC and played it until your mum said "Richard!" (only my mum calls me Richard) "get off that computer and go outside and get some exercise! Do you want to be dead at 35?" Well, I'm 36 now mum. Nearly 37. So who's laughing through their heart palpitations now?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update:  This evening, we received the following "communication from the Spiders studio":

Paris, 28th August 2024 – The Union of Video Game Workers (Syndicat des
Travailleurs (ses) du Jeu Vidéo) has publicly relayed allegations concerning the
working environment at Spiders. The false and even defamatory accusations made by
the STJV in no way reflect the reality of the day-to-day working life of the company's
employees and are an attack on the reputation of the studio, whose teams are fully
mobilized to produce quality games and enthusiastically ensure the Early Access
release of GreedFall 2.

Spiders' management is committed to open and constructive social dialogue. After
unsuccessful attempts over the last few days to meet with a delegation of employees,
they have proposed a meeting again by the end of the week.

Spiders' employees are the heart of the studio, and we are determined to maintain an
inclusive and stimulating working environment in which every talent can flourish and of
which we can all be proud.

The email was signed by Consulting Director Caroline Richard and Associate Director Laurence Tovi.

A shiny whippet to the first of you to correctly identify which of these are real, and which were invented for “roguelite word puzzle RPG” Sternly Worded Adventures. Actually, scratch that. I’m not made of whippets, and you can just as easily find out yourself via the Steam demo.

While it would be a monumentally silly heel turn to go back on their promise of only charging Space Marine 2 players extra for cosmetics a mere week and change before the shooter’s September 9 release date,  the new year one roadmap does at least look piously forthright.
Chatting to James at Gamescom recently (possibly from his cathedral ship made out of graphics cards), Saber boss Tim Willits dragged out an armoured horse and proceeded to flog it mercilessly, saying that players don’t want to be sold the equivalent of Oblivion's infamous deadbeat daddy of DLCs. As several of you identified, this seemed like an odd comparison when Spice Maureen 2 specifically plans to charge for comparable cosmetics, although I imagine Willits was referencing the “packs” that his space game’s baubles come in. “Our fans never thought we ripped them off in World War Z,” he said, comparing Space Marine 2’s optional spendables to that game.
Whether you see the cosmetic's pricing as egregious or not, yesterday’s roadmap does look to make good on Saber’s promise to keep wearables and playables separate. Here’s it:

Yet last night, a site with close to two billion visits disappeared in similar circumstances, rapidly followed by another, and then many others after that. In the absence of an official announcement, earlier today we took an early sift through the wreckage.

I have ample nostalgia for the old marsupial myself, with his second Naughty Dog-developed outing being a particular obsession, but come now, we're all about deckbuilders, soulsliking and battle royale nowadays, right?
Still, I'll admit to a twinge of disappointment after reading that a Crash Bandicoot 5 was once in development at Crash 4: It's About Time developers Toys For Bob, and might have featured an interdimensional team-up with one of Crash's old rivals. No, not Mario.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When we talk about a game having a sense of place, it’s often about how adroitly it covers up the necessary falsehoods of a world contrived to accommodate the player character. It’s the good kind of lie. One with purpose, like Lucas smearing vaseline over the camera lens to cover up the landspeeder’s wheels. Star Wars Outlaws, then, is a strange case. Because while its planets and cities do feel ersatz as living places, they’re kind of incredible as film sets. That’s your job here. This is where the game is. You don’t play it so much as you perform your role in a series of loving, enthusiastic callbacks. That’s a star war. This is a star war. Oh, hey, I know that! That’s one of my favourite star warses.

When he is eaten by a passing disco lizard or ravenous skull-faced vulture, it is because he is basically a delicious Squirmle existing in a horrifying cryptozoological ecosystem. He is, however, never stepped upon by a mech with a missile launcher. He is never given a shotgun and tasked with shooting the other animals. Yet that basically seems to be the elevator pitch for Uruc, a sci-fi metroidvania set in a distant future where strange life battles mechanical monstrosities.

That's not necessarily a bad thing, and with TWW out this very second it does make me think, "Hmmm, what if I do make a return". This happens every time.

Supermassive Games and Behaviour Interactive must have gotten the memo too. They've just released a demo for their next horror game The Casting Of Frank Stone, in which you are a policeman, Sam Green, who is investigating the disappearance of a child. The search leads you to Cedar Hills Steel Mill, "where chilling secrets await, revealing a far more sinister truth than anyone could have anticipated". I am anticipating: QTEs during escape sequences, branching choices that get people killed, and General Mature Content appropriate to the coming of Halloween.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Almost a decade after his acrimonious departure from Konami, the shadow of Hideo Kojima still looms over Metal Gear Solid. He's there, barely camouflaged, in the undergrowth of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater - a remake of the fifth Metal Gear game, originally released in 2004, which tells the tale of a lone US special operator hunting superweapons and old mentors in the jungles of the southern Soviet Union. 


I say "remake" but this feels more like a re-release, in spirit. True, it now runs on Unreal Engine, with the option of a manual, third-person perspective and cover-shooter controls in addition to the old top-down viewpoints. Yes, it boasts new flourishes, such as wounds now leaving scars, and clothes picking up stray leaves. Yes, there's a new interface with floating in-world menus, which makes shuffling between the layers a bit less awkward. It's the product of much labour, with development split between Konami and external support partner Virtuos. But where Konami's other big restoration project, Bloober's Silent Hill 2 remake, is a creative dialogue with the original game, Delta seems consumed by faithfulness to Kojima's original design.

The sweetest, smartest dumbo in the world, yes she is. Ahem. This week, it’s Supermassive, Niantic, and Sensible Object narrative designer and Limit Break mentor, Anastasia Dukakis! Cheers Ana!

The second season ended earlier this month after the eighth episode, though many fans had hoped for more. Pirates who downloaded the unexpected 'House of the Dragon S02E09' release got a surprise bonus, but not the one they were hoping for.

Neither Mantel nor Beaton mention mechs, which are a core feature of Studio Imugi's new "ideology driven" turn-based strategy game Bonaparte: A Mechanized Revolution. I, for one, feel like I've been grossly ill-informed. Kate, Hilary - I've been quoting you for years at parties and it seems like all this time, people have been silently judging me for my ignorance of the role giant clockwork soldiers played in the fall of the Bastille.

It’s also not a terribly accurate one. From what I saw of the game, Dinolords is more about the lords than the dinos, having as much in common with Diablo-style ARPGs as it does with classic strategy. And that’s a distinction which might just elevate it out of novelty status.

Trailered this week at Gamescom 2024, it's the fifth installment in the hitherto mobile-focussed Nikki series and it's seemingly going down a storm, with over 12 million pre-registrations so far (albeit, many of them motivated by the prospect of collectively unlocked in-game bonuses). It's also a free-to-play game, and I have the usual unanswered questions about currencies and gacha, but I'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt for the minute, because I have not spent nearly enough of my life considering the tactical applications of ballgowns. Here's that trailer.

That discussion was back on my mind as I sat down to play Reignbreaker, a new action-roguelike from Studio Fizbin, at Gamescom 2024 – slightly wary of its self-described medievalpunk styling. However! Turns out you’re trying to kill the queen. Yep, that’s, uh, that’s pretty punk.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my formative video game moments is the final mission of Psygnosis cyberpunk flight sim G-Police. (It came out in 1997, and as such, I think the statute of limitations on spoilers has passed, but if you still intend to play, stop reading now.) The mission completes the long arc of foreshadowing begun by the intro's mention that capital-class spacecraft have been outlawed, following a ruinous war. It turns out that one particular evil corpo has been sneakily building one of these megaships - not only that, but you get to fly inside it, cannons ablazing. It was while doing so that teenage me realised the true exceptionality of the Video Game Artform. You can't fly inside capital ships in, like, symbolist poems or baroque symphonies, can you? You can't fly in poems or symphonies at all, unless you do so metaphorically - "metaphor" being a kind of poor man's graphics card.
The technology of flight simming has advanced mightily since G-Police's day. For instance: in Everspace 2's just-announced Titans DLC, you get to fly inside not just regular old spaceships, but massive space kaiju with procedurally generated digestive systems. Here's the trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin's Creed: Valhalla, Odyssey, and Origins all have one thing in common: they've got a Discovery mode, which replaces murdering with learning. You can, quite literally, go on tours curated by historians around each of the game's respective maps. Instead of diving off a Sphinx and plunging your hidden blade into someone's spinal column, you can look up at the Sphinx and read a paragraph on its significance. Maybe view an actual, real life bit of ancient Egypt from an actual real life museum collection in-game. Perhaps embody an Anglo-Saxon lad in Valhalla, instead, and like, cook up some nettle soup having just got a fresh "Friar Tuck" at the local hair choppers (no guarantees on this last bit).
This is all to say that Black Myth: Wukong deserves such a mode, too. There were so many times throughout my review time where I stopped and stared and wondered as to something's meaning. Not only in the architecture, but in the characters, too. So here I am with a proposition: how about instead of thwacking things with my staff, I can use it as a walking stick and point it at things I want to learn about.

Or I assume we have, for why else would we not have yet posted about the Steam Rhythm Fest, which began on Monday and runs until August 26th at 10am PT/6pm BRDST*.

Yeah, a new Tokyo Xtreme Racer was just announced from original developers Genki, and it's targeting a Steam release next year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft have announced Heroes of Might & Magic: Olden Era, a fresh instalment in the exceedingly olden turn-based strategy RPG series, which began life under New World Computing in 1995. The new game will “return to the world of Enroth and the origins of the legendary saga”, inviting “both veterans and new players” to go on a quest to Jadame, “a mysterious continent in turmoil”. Expect new factions, biomes and creatures, together with such M&M standbys as castle management, army clashes, hex-based maps, and, who knows, maybe some heroes.

Developers Striking Distance and publishers Krafton have revealed [REDACTED], a scifi roguelike dungeon crawler set in the same universe.
The square brackets are part of the title, yes, and they're also calling it "punk rock" - a combination of factors that fills me with a rage so obliterating, I can barely perceive the announcement trailer, below. It's a machinegun montage of comicbook panels and sizzling melee arcs and quips like "there's a lot of wankers between you and the sweet taste of freedom". I didn't even like The Callisto Protocol that much but still, what have they done to you, boy? Where did all the horror game go?

It’s just that I find myself rooting so hard for this not to just be a vapid bit of meme-ware that I’m getting more concerned as we rapidly approach its 29th August release.

If a park sim based on Tim Burton’s 1996 B-Movie homage Mars Attacks wasn’t on my bingo card, it’s because I’ve recently binned it and replaced it with a bobble head that simply nods in amused acceptance at whatever videogames decide to do next. And conceptually, Jurassic World Evolution with captive humans instead of dinos isn’t not a potential winner, is it? Still, I was mildly bemused to learn that Mars Attracts, coming sometime next year, is the film’s first licensed game. But then I realised that I’d never thought to check before, which might go some way to explaining the lack of them. Do you reckon they did the pun then worked backwards from there? Respectable, honestly.

My turn to puff out my cheeks and look not angry, just disappointed: why haven't we covered The Stone Of Madness prior to the below Gamescom 2024 story trailer? I mean, it's only a real-time tactical stealth game set in a cursed 18th century Jesuit monastery, developed by the people behind gorgeously gross metroidvania Blasphemous. It's only got isometric art inspired by Goya and a sanity/trauma system redolent of Darkest Dungeon. Sounds like an automatic RPS write-up to me.

He'd tackle headscratchers by unwinding the very fabric of his body, similar to how a human being might feed their intestines through a karabiner and use it as a tether for a spot of rock climbing. Well, some of the minds behind Unravel are working on new game called Hela. This time it's less about yarn and more about being a small mouse who does parkour. Still, it does retain some of the bodily gymnastics of its predecessor. Namely the use of tongues as bungee ropes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've yet to discover a SteamWorld game I don't like. Whether plundering the earth in SteamWorld Dig 2 or mucking about with magic in SteamWorld Quest, these are solid and approachable adventures that enthusiastically embrace whatever theme the developers have decided upon. Cowboys? Sure. Wizards? Why not. It barely matters, as long as it results in some good puns. As a studio, Thunderful have a reputation for hopping from one style of game to the next, boiling entire genres down to their essence, and reconstituting them with competence and style to exist within a now-familiar steampunk world of colourful pals and Saturday morning cartoon jokes. The studio is a perpetual notion machine. Yes, with SteamWorld Heist 2, they're revisiting the sci-fi bullet-bouncing of their 2016 tactics game SteamWorld Heist, but they're also introducing significant changes to create a compulsive XCOM-like full of sea-faring submariners that may be their best work yet, even against a back catalogue of blinders.

The Shattered Space expansion, out on September 30th, probably won’t refurbish the RPG’s reputation as an overall miss – but it does ditch the proc-gen planet bloat for a single handcrafted hellhole, a true Bethesda speciality honed by years of Fallouts and Elder Scrollseses. And, if its - sadly hands-off - Gamescom showcase is any indication, it might just double down on Starfield’s own strengths as well.

In development at Sniper Elite makers Rebellion, it’s a "survival-action game inspired by real-life events" – specifically the Windscale fire, which in 1957 coated much of northern England in radioactive fallout. Atomfall’s alternative history makes Britain’s worst nuclear disaster even more disastrous, plunging the realm into full-on post-apocalyptica and leaving your good amnesiac self to dodge death with nothing but a cricket bat and whatever you can scrounge out of sheds. I like it! Mostly.

I dare boldly to maintain that there is such a thing as Too Wide, a point beyond which the extra visual estate becomes a waste of electricity, unless you watch the screen in pairs. I can only assume people who use ultrawide monitors live in constant terror of flanking manoeuvres and demand the maximum amount of peripheral vision. Mind you, I tend to play games with my nose about 10 centimetres from the screen. Forget being flanked - it's the prospect of snipers up ahead I'm worried about.
If you're among the people who fret excessively about flankers, I've got great news from Uncle BioWare. Forthcoming RPG Dragon Age: The Veilguard will support 21:9 ultrawide monitors. The ultrawide functionality extends to cinematics - you can disable "cinematic aspect ratios" to switch off the black bars that otherwise hem in the view. It's one of several PC-specific flourishes they've just blogged about. Have a look.

Unfortunately for James, he accidentally walked straight into Gamescom. “I’m starting to think that there are a lot of video games” he informed us yesterday. Horrifying if true. Still, it does sound like he’s managing to have some fun there, mainly by hitting up Saber Interactive COO and former id Software co-owner Tim Willits for some top tips on how to avenge Edwin’s thieving ways.
Tips about kill-stealing aside, James found time to ask Willits about Space Marine 2's microtransactions, and whether there was any nervousness returning to a cult hit series… especially one a lot of people had almost given up on ever seeing again. “Even the “push forward” combat of the original was part of [id’s] inspiration when we created Doom 2016,” answered Willits. “So for me personally, it’s this huge circle. It’s always intimidating working on a franchise that people love.” But, with the right team, technology, and vision he says, “it just comes together.”

But I had a fun time with its mixture of Halo-esque trigger pulling and portalling around! So I was intrigued to give the alpha version of Splitgate 2 a go and see if it had a little more substance to it than its initial reveal, which gave off a, "it's Splitgate but with more money" feel. 
Well, I think it's… a bit serious? It certainly has more polish and some extra additions, yet I didn't come away from it thrilled by its more competitive, class-based FPS leanings. I think it just needs a bit more time, perhaps, for a portal to open and some silly rocket launchers and baseball bats and zombies to come tumbling out of it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lo, a ripple in the release date sands. Stand still a moment while we study this phenomenon. Yes, yes, it is the unmistakable rumble of a large survival MMO pondering its release date. Dune: Awakening is having a think and has decided "early 2025" is a good non-specific time period to come out in early access. That could mean January or February. Or March, I guess. April? Now don't be silly, that's spring. Not April, surely. This beast seems hungry. It will eat before then. I have foreseen it. Mostly by watching the trailer that dropped at Gamescom.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arc Raiders was announced back in 2021 as a free-to-play co-op third-person shooter, and has been delayed several times since. That's partly because Embark Studios' other in-development game, The Finals, progressed faster than planned and stole its momentum. It's also because it was re-tooled at some point as a PvPvE extraction shooter.

Now it's back again, aiming for release next year, and it's been re-tooled a little more: it's no longer free-to-play.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oh, and new Indiana Jones And The Great Circle trailer! Great. I’ve been looking forward to a nice, juicy chunk of extended gameplay. You know, something to really convey the flow of the game, rather than the admittedly impressive but nonetheless very fragmented snippets we’ve gotten so far. Now to sit back and…oh, wait. Hang on. It’s just actor Troy Baker telling me about all the great acting he’ll be doing. It is great, by the way. He’s doing a fantastic job. Maybe just, you know, a crumb of acknowledgement or elucidation over the whole ‘interactivity’ part?
Anyway, don’t mind me. I’m just an old fool who likes to press buttons. And, to be fair, it's not like Machinegames don't have a great track record. Anyway, here’s some good news: The game releases December 9th this year. Have a release date trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Little Nightmares DNA runs strong in Tarsier Studios’ new game. So much so, in fact, that I’d assumed the trailer I watched during an online preview event last week was for a new entry in the horror cinematic-platformer series, right up until the name Reanimal appeared on the screen - shortly followed by a snippet of voiced dialogue.
It’s not just the horror setting, but the Grimm’s fairytale threat, the distorted adults-made-monsters through the trauma-tinged lens of a child’s imagination. A long-limbed man riding a bicycle in a threadbare suit chases children down an alley. A gangly, bowler-hatted pursuer scuttles down a long table like a spider. It's familiar enough territory, at least at first glance. But when Tarsier have a body of work subconsciously scarred by phantasms this vivid, recurring nightmares are just as potent.

Devastating, especially since it's only ever happened to me once. Anyway, this is a long but no less meaningful segue to a game from the Far: Changing Tides and Lone Sails devs Okomotive that's just been announced at this year's Geoffcom show. It's called Herdling and it's nothing to do with sailing across a decaying universe, but very much to do with alpine expeditions and friendly beasts. Very unexpected.

There are Nazis to fight in Indiana Jones And The Great Circle - a globe-trotting, tomb-robbing adventure featuring a Lost Ark-era Harrison Ford - but as you'd expect from a Lucasfilm adaptation, there's rather less of the bloodshed.
