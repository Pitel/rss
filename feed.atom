        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unlike traits and races, titles in Verse Piece don't increase your damage or your stats in any way. However, good titles make grinding levels and Gems a lot easier, especially early on. So, to help you out with unlocking all of them, we prepared the following Verse Piece title guide below.


What are Titles in Verse Piece?


Titles in Verse Piece multiply all Money, Gems, and XP that you get by killing mobs and Bosses or by rolling on the gacha machines in the Verse Arcade. Titles are unlocked in various ways. For example, you can get titles by leveling up, completing quests, and killing Bosses. Some titles are also needed to unlock certain Specs and Swords.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unlocking the option to play with other humans (multiplayer) increases the scope of Civilization 7 by a massive margin, as it allows you to test your wits and strategization powers to the fullest.


While the AI can prove to be a stern test, it can feel repetitive after a while. Thankfully, Civilization 7 fully supports multiplayer, as you can play with your friends to find out who's the best. In fact, the presence of online play also raises the scope for playing with strangers over the internet or organizing local events.


How to setup multiplayer in Civilization 7


To play online, you'll have to open a 2K account. This step is free, but it's mandatory for any online session. If you already have an account, just log in.


Once you're signed into your 2K account, you'll be able to join a lobby and participate in the game present on it. Alternatively, you can even create your own lobby and invite your friends/other players to participate. Civilization 7 offers you full control over your lobby, as you can tweak the basic rules, decide on the starting age, and more.


You can also enjoy an offline multiplayer mode, which works via a functioning LAN network. This is suitable if you and your friends are present at the same location and have multiple devices. It's a great alternative to the online system. If you're on a console, you'll need an applicable subscription to host/participate in the online sessions.




Does Civilization 7 have hot seat multiplayer?


As of the early access, there is no hot seat multiplayer function. Having the feature is perfect if you're looking to introduce the game to your friends, as they can play on the same device. There's always a chance for the feature to be introduced later as part of a future update.

If you're planning to add these limited Eels to your Beastiary, this guide can help you. Here's how to catch the Lovestorm Eel in Roblox Fisch.


Before you catch a Lovestorm Eel

Before you catch these limited Eels, keep in mind that they can only be caught during the Lovestorm event. Simply log in during the Valntines event, do your usual thing, and wait for a message to pop at the top which says that the Lovestorm event has started. Head to the location, look for the fish pool (obviously, use a fish tracker to find the pool), and start casting.


How to catch a Lovestorm Eel


Lovestorm Eels are really difficult to catch. You'll know you hooked one if you get a whopping -90% Progression Speed. It's definitely going to be a long battle, so it's advised you equip yourself with a rod that boosts progression (A Zeus Rod, Kraken Rod, or the No-Life Rod are fantastic for this). Check out our Complete Fisch Roblox Rod List, Locations, & Crafting Recipes if you need help with finding any of these.

While the Lovestorm Eel is going to be a bright Valentine pink, you can also catch many of its mutated forms.


That's all there is to it. Good luck with catching a Lovestorm Eel, and don't forget about everything else in the Valentines Update. If you need a boost, check out our Fisch codes guide.

Electric-Type Pokemon make up around 88 entries in the Pokédex. It is also the typing of the series mascot, Pikachu. With such a powerful force in this typing, it can be tough for some to counter it.
After all, Electric-Type Pokemon are some of the most resistant in the series. They have few weaknesses and resist a fair bit of types at the same time. On the other hand, they are matched by a somewhat low number of Pokemon they are super effective against. In most cases, when you face off against an Electric-Type Pokemon, chances are you’ll be in for a neutrally damaging battle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm convinced a Forza Horizon 6 announcement is on the horizon, if you'll excuse the shoddy pun. 2025 marks four years since the launch of Forza Horizon 5 -- longer than the gap between any Forza title ever. While a formal announcement has yet to be made, I think the hints are out there. 


All cheekiness aside, there genuinely are reasons why one might expect Playground Games to finally come out and reveal that Forza Horizon 6 is in some stage of development. This is one of Xbox's most successful game series by far, and it stands tall even in the wake of Halo's failures and Gears of War's long absence. It's so successful that it's even being ported over to PlayStation 5.


This is one of the key reasons why I think we'll be getting a Forza Horizon 6 announcement in 2025. Before we get to …]]></summary>

One of the best reasons to play the Luigi’s Mansion series is the simple joy that comes with exploring new, spooky environments. Truly, the locations are the star of the show.
The first entry in 2001 was arguably too short and a bit too easy and repetitive, but its titular mansion was a compelling backdrop. Cobwebs adorned the walls, bats fluttered through the corridors, and of course, spooky ghosts inhabited every dank, dusty room of the majestic manor. It wasn't the Mario game everyone wanted for the GameCube's launch, but it proved a solid first stab at something new.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Regardless of how you feel about the game, Starfield at least offered something a bit different from Bethesda that wasn't under the Elder Scrolls or Fallout umbrella. And it scratched that sci-fi, space-faring itch when we weren't engrossing ourselves in No Man's Sky.


Now, if you really want to experience the awesome spectacle of space exploration, Bethesda is giving away the chance to see one up close. As noted in a recent blog post, you could be the lucky winner who will get a chance to take a trip to the Kennedy Space Center to watch Lonestar's upcoming Freedom Mission launch to the moon.




The launch will take place on February 26 and will give one person (plus a guest) the opportunity to rub elbows with astronauts and others in attendance.


Moony McMoonFace


As if that wasn't enough, the winner will also have the chance to transmit their own message to Earth's moon. Now, we all know that giving people on the internet the opportunity to deliver something special to the population is typically a recipe for disaster (or hilarity), so it stands to reason that this message will be massively vetted and made appropriate before launch.


Here's everything the winner will receive:



A flight to and from Orlando, Florida


A hotel accommodation in Orlando, FL, for the duration of the trip


One Day Pass for the Kennedy Space Center on launch day


Access to view the Freedom Mission launch



The mission itself is a chance for Lonestar to send the first-ever data center to the moon "for the future of humanity."


Sadly, according to the competition rules, it's only eligible for people who live in the US. If you do qualify to enter, you can fill out this form, which is also where you will get to suggest what message you'd like delivered. The sweepstake ends February 13 at 12 pm ET. Make sure you check the full rules before entering.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, A Feast for the Poor quest introduces you to Chenyek, who will test your abilities with a set of questions.


You'll first meet him when you arrive in Kuttenberg. Chenyek is part of the guild, and he will assign you certain tasks. But to complete them, you'll have to join the first crew, which will make it necessary for you to complete the quiz. The quiz can be completed successfully if you manage to answer all three questions successfully.


Chenyek's Guild Test correct answers in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2


Chenyek's quiz has three questions, and you won't get a second chance. If you fail to get the correct answer during the first attempt, you'll have to forego the quiz. When you make a wrong choice, Cheynek will tell you the correct answer. Thankfully, the quiz isn't reliant on your in-game stats and skills, and there are no skill checks as well. To solve the challenge, you'll have to answer all of them correctly in the first attempt. 


Question
Answer




What is Wycliffe's first thesis?
Repentance


Which estate has the greatest reformatory potential?
The Common People


Who is the rightful King of Bohemia?
Wenceslas






Interestingly enough, getting a wrong answer will forfeit the quiz, but you will still be able to join the guild.  I am not sure why Warhorse has designed the quest in this fashion, as answering wrongly doesn't appear to have a negative effect. However, the guide will certainly help you get all the correct answers.

In many ways, the quiz is pretty similar to Riddler Barley's riddles, which can help you to win Groschen by solving all of them. Here's a detailed guide that will help you crack all the riddles thrown at you by Barley. While he appears randomly in the game, some of his riddles can be pretty tricky to find the correct answers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Poison recipes represent a special category of Alchemical potions that can be obtained in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, and they can be extremely helpful in combat.


To craft these items, you'll first need to unlock the recipes. Then, you'll have to get the required ingredients in the right amounts to manufacture the items. Let's first take a look at all the available resources, followed by how to obtain them to use in the game.


All Poison Recipes in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2


So far, we have discovered three different recipes that belong to the Poison type.


Poison
Ingredients
How to obtain




Bain Poison
Amanita Muscaria, Belladonna, Wine, and Wormwood
First, pour the Wine and Wormwood. Boil for 2 turns, and then add the Belladonna after grinding it. Finally, add Amanita Muscaria before using the Distiller. 


Dollmaker Potion
Herb Paris, Spiritus, and Valerian
Add the Spiritus, followed by Herb Paris , and then boil for three turns. Grind the Valerian and it to the cauldron, and boil it for two turns. 


Lullaby
Oil, Poppy, Herb Paris, and Thistle
Add the Oil to cauldron as the base, and then add Poppy to boil for one turn. Add the Thistle, and boil for one turn. Finally, add Herb Paris and boil for one final turn. 






How to use Poison on weapons in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2


Once you have crafter a Poison recipe, it will be available along with your potions. Select the item you want to use. Then, select the item you want to use it on, and it will gain the effects. You can also use Poison on a food item, but make sure to not consume it (lest you want to feel its ill effects). 


Thankfully, the process of crafting a Poison is pretty much the same as crafting any other potion. Most of the ingredients are easy to find, and they can be used in other Alchemy recipes as well.

The Switch 2 is obviously the big focus for Nintendo moving forward, but one other area of business it plans to continue is mobile applications.
During the company's Q&A for its latest financial earnings, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa was asked about the company's "current position" when it comes to smart devices and the "plans for them going forward". Unsurprisingly, it's "continuing to develop new game applications" for mobile as it remains a "very important" touchpoint for consumers.

Whether you're looking to max your alchemy skill or want to finish an optional mission objective, knowing the best spot to find Comfrey will help you out.


Comfrey location in KCD2


The best spot to find Comfrey early on is in the Apothecary's herb garden in Troskowitz. The garden has several crops you can gather from to obtain this ingredient, among numerous others, quickly. Most NPCs won't notice or care if you take Comfrey from this spot, especially if you go at night when fewer people are around.

It probably says something about the system that the question 'y cant metroid crawl?' is one of the most memorable nostalgia nuggets from the Wii U era.
Don't get me wrong - while the initial messaging was poor, the GamePad's killer apps never really arrived, and the system itself was slow and bulky, I still loved my Wii U. But with Nintendo spending the last eight years picking at its carcass and making its greatest hits accessible on 150 million more consoles, many memories made by the Wii U's faithful few are now muddled with the shinier 'Deluxe' versions.

Cobalt Core, Wildfrost, Shogun Showdown (if you squint). All excellent, but Diceomancer stands out above even those, thanks to a clever gimmick and a hefty dose of chutzpah. It’s there in the strapline, you know the deal, but to emphasise: you can reroll ANY number on your screen. 

Your health, enemy health, attacks, blocks, buffs, mana, gold - all fair game. The numbers in encounters. On Relics. Have at ‘em! Heck, and that’s before you start scribbling in the rulebook.

It's a rare blip in what is otherwise an exceptionally well-crafted Zelda title in which you're presented with a single row of echo abilities that simply widens further and further as you accumulate more during your playthrough.

Yet beyond the sparkling glamour of marketing slides, however, path tracing remains exceptionally niche: nearly six years since Quake II RTX served as the tech’s de facto gaming debut, you can still count the number of compatible games on your fingers. Compare and contrast with the dozens upon dozens of games that have embraced ray tracing, path tracing’s less demanding nephew, and you’ll likely start wondering why more game devs don’t go for it.
We’re not here to answer that, though. This is Should You Bother With, here to investigate whether you should start using path traced effects to give your games – some of them, anyway – the full maxed-out-visuals treatment. Even if it takes a graphics card upgrade to do so.

Hideki Kamiya has stated on social media that he would rather players not experience Okami via the 2008 Wii port (thanks, Automaton).
Originally released on PS2 back in 2006, Okami's move to the Wii was handled by the now-defunct American studio, Ready at Dawn. When creator Kamiya was approached by a fan and mistakenly asked whether it's recommended they start with the Wii original, Kamiya responded to clarify that the PS2 version is the true OG.

Cape Cosmic, the developer behind the fabulous Phoenotopia: Awakening, has announced its next project — Star Iliad, a Metroidvania set inside a star whale. And, par the course, the pixel art looks gorgeous. Platforms have yet to be announced yet.
In a blog post on the developer's tumblr, Cape Cosmic reveals that its new game leans much closer to a Metroid game rather than Phoenotopia's Zelda-esque trappings. The map is much larger, with the devs promising 40 hours of gameplay, and guns are your weapon of choice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's do the time warp again.
On Western shores last yast year, Falcom started a fresh arc in its long-running flagship franchise with The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak, breathing new life into the series while offering a great jump-in point for newcomers looking for a place to start. With the overall Trails series rapidly nearing the conclusion of the epic story it’s been building up for the last couple of decades, Falcom has now released The Legend of Heroes: Trails Through Daybreak II, allegedly the final release in this arc. This sophomore outing for Van and crew feels a little more uneven than its predecessor, but is ultimately a worthwhile new entry.
The plot picks up not too long after the previous game, starting once again with protagonist Van Arkride taking a midday nap on the couch in his office. He’s soon visited by his old friend Elaine from the Bracer Guild, who alerts him to reports of a new serial killer on the loose in Calvard. As the local Spriggan (a sort of private investigator), this would already be in Van’s wheelhouse, but there’s an additional detail that raises the stakes: the killer somehow has their own Grendel form, which was previously thought to be unique to Van. The two thus set out on the trail (heh) to track down the killer.

This one looks like it will appeal specifically to Castlevania fans, and seems to be taking quite a few cues from Castlevania II: Simon's Quest. You've got day/night cycles, merchants, allies, and of course, lots of beasts to slay. In another nod to Castlevania, it's also been confirmed that Robert Belgrade, famous for his role as Alucard in Symphony of the Night, will be providing narration duties.

It’s always a bit disappointing that they don’t do the same when the leak’s coming from inside the house. Such is the case for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, after Sony seemingly accidentally…

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's not the destination, they say, it's the pickled eggs we slurped along the way. In Keep Driving, a turn-based RPG of swishing scenery and smooshed roadkill, you are on a road trip in the early 2000s that will see you gulping coffee and stuffing cheap snacks into your mouth, all in an effort to get to the other side of the country in time for the big concert. It is a hypnotically involving game of picking up hitchhikers and battling tailgaters, a pixel art drivealong with tactile, chunky buttons and perfectly suited sound effects, as much fuelled by nostalgia as it is by gasoline. At first, I thought it was too loose and open-ended to elicit any deep feelings. But then I had to sell my guitar for half a tank of petrol, just to visit my dying grandmother. Dude, this is a game that goes places.

Less blowing, actually. More taunting me from my screen maddeningly like a middle finger salute from a man with no hands. It was a baffling piece of licensed merch from Disco Elysium studio ZA/UM and Atelier, who I assume are three hyenas in a board room sniffing each other's crotches for eternity.
I couldn't tell you exactly where I first saw the bag - which has actually been on sale for a few months now - but I soon realised why it had likely entered the zeitgeist again: an extensive set of a documentary podcasts by YouTube creator The 41st Precinct, the latest of which interviews writers Dora Klindžić and Argo Tuulik for more time than I have ever spent on anything. Here's a clip on Atelier and that fucking bag.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[True to the word of Capcom’s German social media marketing, Monster Hunter Wilds has a new, generally less extravagant set of PC system requirements ahead of its February 28th launch. There’s also a standalone benchmark tool that you can download from the game’s Steam page, so you can see for yourself how the beast-biffing RPG will run on your hardware.
In theory, these are great developments. Lower requirements mean a more widely accessible game, and the benchmark tool – which covers a good six minutes of combined cinematics and simulated free roaming – brings reassurance and accountability to this otherwise hype-reliant prerelease period. Sadly, there are two problems. One, the benchmark confirms outright that Monster Hunter Wilds will run like stagnant goulash on low-end PCs, and two, it does so to the extent that I’m not sure that the revised minimum specs are even reliable.

The studio revealed their plans in a video showing three prototypes they're currently working on. The working title for this one is "Humanity 2.0" and it'll see you carving up derelict ships to build your own vessel and sometimes defending that ship from pirates trying to take it over. It sounds like you'll still be the sweaty cybermaster of a bunch of glitchy drones, who now might suffer "fun personality quirks" when you install upgrades, "like not wanting to go down narrow corridors because it's now claustrophobic". 
Sad, busted-ass space robots just trying to get by? Yes, I'm interested.

To a normal person, adding a 2 to the end of your game's name is the sign of a sequel. But as the attendant decimal and zero suggest, it's not clear if that's exactly what he means. It could mean a revamp with new features, or some other new direction for the existing game. His later words do make it sound more like this is what EA have in mind. Or at least what they're prepared to tell folks in a financial report.

This ends the fight immediately. Sometimes I resort to this low move out of frustration, when a dull fight has dragged on for too long. Sometimes I resort to it out of panic, because I’ve accidentally set fire to every hard surface within ten feet, or frozen myself to a wall. Often it’s just for the pleasure of it. 

In Eternal Strands, Yellow Brick Games’ debut title, you play the leader of a "weaver band", a crew of freelance magicians, in a world where something extremely bad happened to magic. Some years ago, the Enclave, a city state acting as the isolationist heart of the world’s magic, exploded in a kind of power surge - one part tsunami, one part blown fuse - and just as quickly sealed itself off from the world outside. Somehow managing to breach the wall, your band finds themselves the first people to set foot inside the ruined capital since the calamity and sets about uncovering the mystery of what exactly went wrong.

Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has earned Playable status on the Steam Deck, and it’s a shrewd assessment on Valve’s part: there are some shortcomings that keep the coveted Verified badge out of Deliverance 2’s reach, most notably its cramped UI, but I’ve been bumbling around the medieval RPG for hours now and it is indeed plenty functional in handheld mode. Despite its system requirements arguably suggesting otherwise, it can even manage some decent 40fps-plus performance without dumping all the quality settings to their lowest.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vendrán Las Aves - "The Birds Will Come" - is a brief, quiet, hopeful game about burnout recovery. Summarised as a "slice of life tamagotchi" and available in Spanish and English, it's a gamejam production from Francisco Riolobos, Chuso Montero and Deconstructeam, the Valencia-based developers behind The Red String Club and The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood.
It's free to download from Itch.io, and takes the form of a snowglobe perspective of somebody's one-room apartment. The person in question has just left their job after a rough spell, and has impulsively bought a guitar. They are also, however, totally exhausted, with barely the willpower to do anything beyond getting out of bed, let alone make music. Your task is to help them through each day and rebuild their morale till they feel able to pluck a few chords.

Wreckfest 2 is the follow-up to smashing racer Wreckfest, which came out in 2018 but which I only discovered last year while listing our best racing games. My friends, it got on the list. Developers Bugbear say they have "overhauled its physics engine to deliver the most intense crashes, deeper component damage, and absolute vehicular mayhem." We can see a little bit of that in a new trailer below, which also gives us an exact early access release date.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warhorse's medieval muck-o-rama Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 launches today. It's an engrossing RPG, despite developer co-founder Dan Vávra's tendency to throw his weight behind alt-right harassment campaigns. Also, a relatively bug-free one. 


In the course of my 51 hours as reviewer, I've encountered only a smattering of more significant technical issues. Firstly, some heavy slowdown while roaming Trosky Castle, the centerpiece of the opening Bohemian Paradise region, which I resolved by quitting and reloading. Secondly, a mildly terrifying moment in a dugout when a wounded soldier I was supposed to be treating struck a T-pose, as though afflicted by lightning early onset arthritis. And thirdly a repeated crash bug which I feel warrants its own article given that, together with Deliverance 2's eccentric saving system, it cost me several hours of progress.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Several hours in, it’s become apparent that I lack the patience for much of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2’s much-publicised historical accuracies, like needing to bathe yourself every six minutes or how 15th century Bohemians can take several consecutive sword swings to the neck without dying. Ah well! If you’re going to play it, know that it’s also a decent performer on PC – despite the almost threatening tone of its recommended system requirements – and, as far as I can see, isn’t anywhere near as bug-prone as the infamously unstable original.

Terry Cavanagh, also the maker of VVVVVV and Dicey Dungeons, is releasing a collection of his freeware bits and bobs on Steam next week, called simply Terry's Other Games. Looking at the games included, it summons a nostalgic giggle just to see just how many of Terry's short games have been intriguing enough to grab the eye of an RPS writer over the years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Peter Akemann - co-founder of Call Of Duty's Treyarch and recent president of The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners studio Skydance Interactive - has pleaded guilty to crashing a drone into a firefighting plane assisting with the recent LA wildfires. The crash, which grounded the plane by damaging its left wing, occurred after Akemann ignored temporary drone restrictions in order to survey the Palisades fires before losing control. Thanks, Eurogamer. For first noticing the case, I mean. I'm not blaming Eurogamer for the drone crash. Not this one, anyway.
The drone was traced back to Akemann, who has agreed to plead guilty to one count of unsafe operation of an unmanned aircraft. That's a misdemeanour that usually carries up to one year prison time, but he's "hoping to escape the prison term in exchange for 150 hours of community service in support of wildfire relief and the approximately $65,000 USD it cost to repair the plane," write Eurogamer, as part of a plea agreement.

He's co-developing this with Evil Gingerbread Studio but his other big project is the Total War: Warhammer III overhaul mod SFO, and it seems barely a month passes without some huge update to that. Venris once told me he mods for around "eight to 12 hours a day", though, so I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that this cult-shepherding roguelite is now available in Steam early access. Edwin described it as "Darkest Dungeon, but you're running the dungeon". That's better than anything I could come up with, so let's stick with that.

"The last carrier bag you’ll ever need," begins the description of this tribute to the plastic bag Disco Elysium's protagonist uses to collect bottles to exchange for cash at Martinet's local off-licence. "Frittte brings reassurance that the bag will serve your everyday needs on the toughest streets."
This nod to people whose main takeaway from Fight Club was how rad Brad Pitt's taste in shirts was is being sold by ZA/UM's collobrative merch store with company Atelier. They've previously put out things like a replica of Kim Kitsuragi's jacket. I'm not going to link them, as a pathetic act of rebellion.
As the man who couldn't afford an ambulance to get the gash on his head sewn up once said, let's try and keep an open mind about this. The bag's Dyneema fabric "is up to 15x stronger than steel on a weight-for-weight basis and provides the highest tear and tensile strength of any competing materials".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Watch out for that falling breezeblock! It's about to-- ah, too late, you've been donked. A clip of loud wreckage, gunfire, and bazooka'd buildings has fallen dustily into our lap via a promotional video for Battlefield 6 (or whatever the developers plan to call the next of these large-scale first-person shooters). Mostly, it's a lot of producers talking a big game about "levelling up" the "core experience", which seems to remain blasting a building you don't like with a rocket-propelled grenade. We can tell from the final 10 seconds of the video, which show some of the game's actual running and/or gunning.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After several hours of battles, sieges, imprisonment and torture in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, a groggy Henry of Skalitz is woken by a servant girl in a castle outside Kuttenberg. She greets him like a nobleman. I have Henry push back. He's a blacksmith's son. He might have some blue blood care of his biological father, but he grew up in the soot and clamour of the forge. The girl nervously insists, however: Henry must be from the upper crust, or he wouldn't have been welcomed and feasted by the lord of the estate. He wouldn't be lying in his very own chamber with its very own hole for shitting in - and in any case, it's more than her job's worth to treat him otherwise. In a timid, not quite spiteful show of reverse class policing, she refuses to end the dialogue until she's dismissed in a manner befitting her station.

Resident Evil 4, Fallout 3, Gears Of War - all bleary examples of a grubby visual style. This peaked in Clive Barker's Jericho, a shooter so desaturated it felt like the colour settings on your monitor were banjaxed. I have heard this called "the piss filter" and generally lamented in industry circles. But it was always a puposeful choice, intended to add some grittiness to the world. And there's at least one developer who is reviving "smeared dirt" as an art direction. As Time Surrenders is a very brown stealth game that takes a lot of inspiration from Metal Gear Solid V.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the internet's leading shadow libraries is calling for an overhaul of copyright law. Anna's Archive believes that if countries want to stay relevant in the AI race, change is a necessity. While it's unlikely that the trove at Anna's Archive will ever be legally accessible by consumers, the site argues that access for AI companies is paramount. "It's a matter of national security," Anna's Archivist says.

Yet, over the past 15 years or so, the major Hollywood studios have convinced authorities in dozens of countries that blocking pirate sites benefits everyone. If the FADPA bill passes, the MPA's export-only site-blocking system will be reimported to the U.S. at close to maximum strength, straight off the bat.

In the U.S., rightsholders are taking a hard line, pursuing legal action against AI companies that utilize copyrighted works without permission.  However, other countries are adopting more lenient approaches, allowing AI models to learn from the vast troves of data found in 'pirate' libraries. This 'copyright schism' could have far-reaching consequences.

Kindly Uncle EA has taken a break from his busy layoff schedule to rustle up a pair of Legacy collections that include a bunch of old expansions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nvidia DLSS 4 has launched under not-terribly-happy circumstances. It’s a mostly AI-powered technology at a time when mistrust in artificial intelligence, fuelled by underbaked applications and anti-creative policies, is at all-time high – not to mention how the new GeForce GPUs it’s released alongside, the RTX 5080 and RTX 5090, have immediately entered 2020-style stock shortage purgatory.
However, having tried it out in a few different games, I suspect time will prove kinder to DLSS 4 than the RTX 50 series launch has been. It is, in fact, a rather nifty collection of upscaling improvements that can help out older graphics cards as readily as the very newest, while building on DLSS 3’s frame generation tool with Multi Frame Generation (MFG) to send visual smoothness skyrocketing. If you care even the slightest iota for how your PC performs in modern games, DLSS 4 demands your attention.
Here, then, I’ll break down DLSS 4’s various tricks and components, looking at how they really affect performance – and whether it’s worth upgrading your rig to maximise compatibility with it.

It may have a splash of Dredge when it comes to inventory management too. Oh, also, a strange man might imply you are "disappointing someone". Nothing to worry about. And the ocean may or may not turn completely red. These decisions have not been finalised. Everything is okay. It is possible the fish are safe to eat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hidden away on NASA's Golden Record, an interstellar archive of music, image and sound, there is a recording of a poem by Charles Baudelaire, Élévation, which describes the astral ascent of the soul. Well, part of a poem. Both to free up room on the disc and perhaps, to edit out "the vast sorrows and all the vexations" of the second half, only the first two stanzas appear. The recording in fact ends halfway through a line, which conjures up an intriguing problem for the listener, inasmuch as the thwarted rhyme scheme reveals that the piece is incomplete. A poetically-minded alien might be tempted to fill in the gap. A fancier alien who took a module in postmodernism might hail the poetics of the fragment. A resolutely practical alien who thinks poetry is for losers might read the whole thing, instead, as a set of incoherent navigational prompts, made up of loose prepositions - au-dessus, au-dessus, par delà, par delà.

Yes, I'm well aware that "2.5D" and "Soulsvania" are nonsense words, woven by pestilent market forces. Samuel Johnson is turning in his grave, I expect. He has risen from his grave and equipped himself with an ironbound dictionary and is even now making his way through the layers of the English language, hellbent on slaughtering every 'vania yet coined.
But never mind Samuel. Oversized rodents and spiders aside, Mandragora is notable for being written by Brian Mitsoda, writer of the original Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines and the former narrative lead for its sequel at Hardsuit Labs, which lives on in the hands of The Chinese Room. Primal have just announced a release date - 17th April. Here's a trailer.

It's a crunchy, dicey machine of vibrant world-building that sometimes forgets itself in wandering prose. A compelling universe to sail through, with more habitats and hovels than its predecessor, more stations and stellar gateways. It can't - for me - escape the dense gravity of the first game's compact storytelling and novel character building, no matter how often it funnels you from one space caper to the next. But it has a good time trying.

Nowhere in the post did the word "layoffs" appear. But this is what the post was actually about. The closest it got to addressing the facts of what happened to an unspecified number of workers is the phrase: "we don’t require support from the full studio." 
It's one of the most disingenuous announcements of job cuts in a recent and plentiful history of job cuts. A weirdly impressive feat from BioWare, considering the last two or three years have seen some spectacular verbal gymnastics from games companies when it comes to shitcanning people. Let's take a look at some of our "favourite" mealy-mouthed press releases in which people have their jobs poetically "sunsetted" rather than, say, dropkicked out the window.

It was David Cronenberg's Minesweeper: The Substance Edition, and I was sincerely worried that I'd put you all off Minesweeper for life. But before you mop your last munition and turn in your index finger for good, give Dragonsweeper a try. It's Minesweeper with an altogether less atrocious twist which you can hopefully deduce from the name.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The layoff train has come for BioWare. A number of Dragon Age: The Veilguard staff are leaving the celebrated RPG company in the course of plans to become "a more agile, focused studio", as BioWare move ahead with the next Mass Effect game. Posting on Bluesky, senior systems designer Michelle Flamm, producer Jen Cheverie, editor Karin West-Weekes, lead writer Trick Weekes and narrative designer Ryan Cormier have all announced that they're looking for work.


All of which feels like it warrants a mention in general manager Gary McKay's recent blog about BioWare's future, but he comments only that they're "taking the opportunity to reimagine" how BioWare operate between projects, and "have worked diligently over the past few months to match many of our colleagues with other teams at EA that had open roles that were a strong fit." Which is a very slippery way to say that you're making a load of people redundant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mere hours before it’s January 30th release – wait, that’s today! – Sony have finally spilled the beans on system requirements for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, as well as the eye-blistering, GPU-rending special features that more powerful rigs can support. Happily, all these ray tracing and frame generation accoutrements seemingly won’t preclude Spidey 2 from working on older, slower PCs as well, as the minimum specs are surprisingly reasonable.
Granted, they’re only rated for 30fps at a lowly 720p, and you’ll still need to find a honking 140GB of SSD space, but the basic GPU and CPU requirements aren’t too lofty at all. The likes of an RTX 3060 for 60fps/1080p are quite reasonable as well, though you’re staring down the barrel of Nvidia’s pricey RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 cards for high-rez ray tracing.

"An account for PlayStation Network will become optional for these titles on PC," said PlayStation in a short and quiet blog post that includes the upcoming PC release for Spider-Man 2, and The Last Of Us Part II. It's been eight months since PlayStation provoked mass annoyance among PC players by making a PSN account mandatory to play Helldivers 2, and later Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered. They soon walked back the decision for Helldivers 2 after a rough review-bombing but the company didn't seem to fully take the hint. It looks like they've now conceded that, yes, the obligatory sign-up was an unpopular move.

The government considers a 'viewing ban' for citizens but, there appears to be no clear idea how or even if that would work.

The blocking orders would apply to both ISPs and DNS resolvers. The latter is a novelty.

"Look at my spaceship go," you say to yourself, "look how fast it crashes into that other, smaller ship." Building your own galactic snowpiercer from scratch in Space Engineers 2 will bring a smile to anyone who once revelled in clicking together Lego podracers and bashing them into one another on the living room carpet with a violence eight-year-olds should not yet have mental access to. That said, this is the precise extent of the things you can do in the game so far. Build 'n' crash. Every feature fits in this opening paragraph. There's good reason to trust the developers' ability to deliver the rest of this crafting and survival game. But right now, it's all core, no loop.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Open world spec op gun-brandisher Phantom Line takes place during a paranormal crisis of such intensity that the outbreak of nuclear war gets relegated to bullet point five on the latest press email. Atomic apocalypse? Ehhh. That's a roadside picnic compared to what S.T.A.L.K.S this alternately Lynchian and Tarkovskian battlefield. You'll wish you'd been dusted by nuclear fire when you're being torn open by some kind of demon puppet in a labyrinth of red curtains.


If you do get torn open by a demon puppet, the good news is that players have a range of artificial bodies to choose from. Among Phantom Line's headline features is the HUSK system, which lets you switch between members of your squad right in the middle of combat. Unless, presumably, the body in question is already occupied by one of your co-op partners. If all this sounds appealing, the even-gooder news is that there's now a demo available via the developer Discord.

Or can you? News comes via Nic himself that modder FrancisLouis, whose previous works include performance-enhancing rejigs of various games (and one that turns the Silent Hill 2 remake’s pipe weapon into a rigid, A-posing wife), has produced Fantasy Optimizer: an overhaul of how FF7 Rebirth handles shaders and streamed visuals.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Has any genus of graphics card been as dramatically storied as the GeForce XX80s? The RTX 3080 was a thing of beauty, only to be tarnished by the worst wheeler-dealing spree (and crypto mining misappropriation) in PC component history. Then the RTX 4080 rocked up with its laughable £1269 / $1199 price tag, a miscalculation so severe that the RTX 4080 Super looked good – despite hardly being any faster – simply for not repeating it. For the new RTX 5080’s sake, you almost want it to be boring.
It isn’t. But then, neither is it a blood-boiler like the RTX 4080, nor a largely aspirational show-off piece like the RTX 5090. By maintaining the 4080 Super’s course correction on price while tooling up on compelling DLSS 4 improvements, the RTX 5080 is an agreeable GPU from the off. Particularly, if you’ve got the 4K monitor to take full advantage of it.

Your goal is to expand an insect colony that is also a motherboard, where glittering pheromone trails double as silicon circuits.

Unwelcoming but oddly comfortable in its rusty soviet Ozymandism. The first sign of sentient life this immersive sim offers me is the greeting of a gasmasked freakdroid as I leave a warehouse. Tinny propaganda songs play from TVs too big to comfortably fit in anyone's car. The warehouse is so huge I thought it was outside until I looked up and there was writing on the sky and I realised it was a roof. I'm still messed up about it, honestly.

Given the scope of the allegations, narrowly focused on a single defendant, the action seems unusually punitive. Yet if the plan was to push Keighin into a corner, the Colorado resident hasn't read the script. Allegations of destruction of evidence, obstructing service, and abuse of Nintendo's legal team, combine to make a dire situation even worse. But not for Nintendo.

I am thankful that the handheld LCD graphics of the era did not allow me to witness my companion blob's amiable decline into shit-caked starvation. I am also thankful that my tamagotchi did not itself have a tamagotchi, because the only life principle I ever taught my tamagotchi was neglect. This is also the reason I may never play the reportedly pretty decent virtual pet game Yoke Heroes: A Long Tamago, whose developers 14 Hours Productions are defying God and Man by developing another virtual pet sim inside it.

E-Day itself is aiming to have a pronounced horror slant, with the 'Emergence Day' of the title referring to the insectoid Locust's first visit above ground.

It's sort of Journey for plague doctors, or possibly The Hobbit: Cosmodick Turpin Edition. I enjoy feeling the weight of those distant peaks upon my brain and eyeballs, but it's nice to fire up Kingdoms, the new free DD2 game mode that's launched just today, and have a choice of disasters to trundle toward.  


Over here is an inn being overrun by slathering beastmen. Over there is another, safer inn, but it's inconveniently perched behind a nest of tentacular cultists. In the middle there is you, with the customary DD party of half-dead, half-mad adventurers, equipped with an exciting smorgasbord of sharp edges, cursed artefacts, phobias and diseases. Let us proceed laughing and wailing to the launch trailer.

It's a single-button affair, having you navigate levels by alternating a pivot-point on a shape I don't know the name of so I'm just going to call a spinny stick.
There are moving background elements in some stages - in others, you make your own pace. Except I can't really make my own pace, can I Bauhaus Bonk? Because the swing soundtrack makes me feel like a plodding buffoon if I'm not responding with appropriate gusto. This is entrapment, game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Continuing last week's Maw merchandising roll-out, may I introduce by popular demand the first official Maw-endorsed letter opener. Now now, don't act coy! I know some of you are old enough to know what a letter opener is, or even to own one. Statistically, most of the RPS readership are Lich Lords. The Maw letter opener differs from regular letter openers in that when you open a letter with it, you will encounter not a letter but a perfect copy of yourself opening a letter in the opposite direction. The two of you must now fight to the death to decide who is the letter-opener and who is the letter. It's yours for a piffling three pints of any available body fluid, but if you don't want to buy a letter opener you can always buy one of this week's new PC games instead.

Something to ponder on, perhaps, as we behold the Steam Brick. As reported by PC Gamer, one Crastinator-pro has documented their journey to transform the Steam Deck into a controller-less, screen-less creature of ineffable bricktitude. Why? Because the Deck didn't fit in their backpack.

When you offer me a five-hour video essay about an obscure adventure game from 1998, I will hide in the closet. But if you idly wonder where the rivers in Skyrim go, I will follow along dutifully like a baby elephant. This is how I ended up spending much of my afternoon watching David Cage characters pissing. One video creator decided to painstakingly count every instance of playable pee time in cinematic adventure game Heavy Rain. This is vital work. This is important work.

In fairness to Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, which Nic says can be great as a game per se, it does make some effort at settling into Windows. It has rebindable M+K controls. It has DLSS. It has generally more consistent framerates than FFXVI, which could bait you in with silky visuals before grabbing your head and shoving it into the cold ice bath of sub-30fps.
Yet it also steps back from that game on its supported tech, while raising its hardware requirements so far above Final Fantasy 7 Remake that it won’t even launch on a lot of older graphics cards. Even so, hitching and microstuttering issues from FF7 Remake return once more, along with plenty of other signs that this PC version didn’t get the love that a lot of other erstwhile PlayStation exclusives – like Horizon Forbidden West or God of War Ragnarök – did for their ports.

We've been keeping a weary middle-aged eye on its development, and yesterday it got a release date. It's too late for most of us in the RPS treehouse.

It's out right now on Steam and Microsoft's Game Pass service. I'd say it has materialised from the darkness like a ninja, but there are a lot of ninjas in circulation at the minute, and my analogy-jitsu gauge is running dry. So instead, I'm going to say that it has materialised from the darkness like a resurfacing duck, its beak stuffed with pond vegetation. The pond vegetation, here, stands for "tweaks to the weapons upgrade system". Here's a trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Typical, really. I get all excited about sharing details from a preview event for upcoming FPS Doom: The Dark Ages, then it turns out the gameplay reveal video is going public before the embargo anyway. Then the alleged release date allegedly leaks, allegedly. How am I supposed to present myself as a font of knowledge now, Id? Fortunately, we had a roundtable interview afterward with executive producer Marty Stratton and game director Hugo Martin. Sweet, job-justifying details!
Writing up the interview in full would involve typing out the words "awesome", "slaughter", "core pillars", and "iPod" more times than anyone realistically needs to read. Instead, here's a list of every detail I found interesting that isn't already covered in the showcase.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We called Amplitude's fiendish and fanciful strategy game Endless Legend the best 4X of 2014, and its hexcellence hasn't dimmed with age. "The music, the amazing variety in terrain and units, the sheer quantity of words bringing to life every last quest, minor faction, creature, and environmental anomaly," breathed a reverential Ollie in 2023. "It's a simply splendid game." Like somebody commenting on the sturdiness of an original Picasso's frame, I will only add that it now runs pretty comfortably on the current least expensive Dell Thinkpad.
Why in Meier's name would Sega choose to sell off the studio behind such a worldly wonder? The answer is lost in time (it's through that link, there), but fortunately, Amplitude endure as an independent - and they've just announced Endless Legend 2 with no less than Hooded Horse as publisher. Here's the announcement trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin's Creed Shadows has a lot riding on it. Between its multiple release date delays in response to Star Wars Outlaws not selling as well as Ubisoft would've liked, and Ubi potentially being bought by Tencent as they clamour for help, there's a sense that Shadows needs to deliver not only a great game, but corporate redemption.
I've now played Shadows for four hours, having dipped into a bit of prologue action, some open world exploration, and a questline as both the hulking Yasuke and the lithe Naoe. Have Ubi delivered? I think there's a strong chance. What I played was a lot of comforting Creeding, carried along by a gorgeous interpretation of Edo Japan, and some subtle tweaks to up stealth stakes. Although I do think the two protagonists are a split personality that doesn't quite work for me.

Mělo to mít nějakou jinou "message" než "když jsi psychopatický gangster, špatně dopadneš"? Ale docela to uteklo. Jednoznačné mínus a nechtěný (zřejmě?) humor tkví ve skutečnosti, že hlavní hrdinka (t.j. žena) pořád vypadá jako nabušený chlap v paruce a během celého filmu to žádné jiné postavě nepřijde divné.
