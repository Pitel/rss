        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You've got a friend in me (in a few weeks)
The next update to the mouse-powered isekai Disney Dreamlight Valley is arriving at the start of next month. The Toy Story realm joins Disney Dreamlight Valley on December 6, 2022.
The new update will arrive on all platforms on December 6, adding the new realm and Toy Story leads Woody and Buzz to the game. Plus, there are some Toy Story cosmetics in store for Disney Dreamlight Valley players to collect.
We got a good look at what's in store for the new area in a recent trailer. It highlights what's in store for intrepid Dreamlight Valley players who wander into Andy's Room.

Buzz Lightyear definitely looks like Buzz Lightyear, but Woody has some wild energy to him. The animations are really moving, in a way that makes me think this cowboy will definitely jump-scare at least one player on a stream.
That said, I've really enjoyed the way Disney Dreamlight Valley reimagines some popular Disney characters. Mickey's entire storyline of being a sad wife guy and seeing ghosts around town was a spin I did not expect, and made me like the character a lot more than just a normal Mickey storyline would have.
Venture into the valley
Disney Dreamlight Valley launched into an early access version this year, and it seems to have had a warm reception. It's a little bit of Animal Crossing meets famous Disney characters, but the appeal makes a ton of sense. Slowly building up a town full of Disney mainstays and seeing them interact, as well as completing some chill quests for them, is an interesting premise that seems to have worked out.
We'll see what kind of energy Buzz and Woody bring to the neighborhood when they arrive in the valley on December 6.

The tactics genre is an old one, and few stand out like Tactics Ogre. The original Let Us Cling Together has hit a number of devices, from the SNES to the PlayStaiton, on to the PSP and finally, with Tactics Ogre: Reborn, our current crop of modern consoles and PC.
Reborn is a remaster of a remake, bringing forward the PSP strategy classic to somewhere it’s more readily playable and fine-tuning it in the process. There are tons of videos and resources out there to grapple with all the changes, massive and miniscule, that Square Enix has made to this classic.

That changed with RimWorld 1.4, which adds "cross-expansion integration", so now you can use the ideology system from the Ideology expansion to, for example, tell stories about people who have ideologies about the biotech from the biotech expansion.

Nintendo has announced that will be adding golf to its sporting compendium Nintendo Switch Sports next week. The game enjoyed by rich capitalists and corrupt officials the world over will find itself added — free of charge — for all players on Monday, November 28.
The golf update will feature an adaptation of the much-enjoyed Wii Sports golf effort, complete with all of that title's 21 holes. Also included is a new "Survival Golf" tournament mode, which will support up to eight players online in a knockout competition to complete holes in the fewest strokes possible.
Of course, casual local play with pals will also be available, so you can probably get your relatives up off of the sofa this Holiday season. Spirit of '09 is back in action, baby.
Nintendo Switch Sports is available now on... Nintendo Switch, naturally.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PC Engine Memories
Japanese studio Edia has announced that it is currently developing retro compilation Telenet Shooting Collection for Nintendo Switch. The compendium features a small handful of shmups that jetted out of developer Telenet Japan in the early '90s, finding an audience on Sega Mega Drive and PC Engine.
The new collection is the spearhead of a project by Edia to archive the works of Telenet Japan, a developer/publisher that produced a huge library of games for the console era's formative years. From arcade adventures to platformers, beat-'em-ups to shmups, Telenet Japan would develop and/or publish titles for a wide variety of platforms including Sega Mega Drive, MSX, PC Engine, Game Boy, and the Sharp X68000.

The Telenet Shooting Collection will feature four titles in total: Sega Mega Drive releases Granada (1990) and Gaiares (1990), and PC Engine titles Avenger (1990) and Psychic Storm (1992). No details have been released in regards to any new modes or additional content, nor has a western localization been announced. The collection is set to launch in Japan on Nintendo Switch in the latter half of 2023.
Additionally, Edia has launched a crowdfunding campaign on Makuake to help fund the development and marketing of the title. With an achievable goal of around three million yen (around $22,000 USD), Edia hopes that the money can be put toward additional features, as well as marketing materials for the title's official release. With the archiving of gaming's earliest eras now more important than ever, this project is increasingly important and could bring some long M.I.A. releases to new audiences.
In related news, Cosmic Fantasy Collection will launch in Japan, December 15, on Nintendo Switch.

Eastasiasoft and Idea Factory have confirmed that they will be re-releasing the anime-style JRPG Mugen Souls on the Nintendo Switch in Spring 2023, with physical editions available for pre-order soon.
The game was originally released for PS3 back in 2012, but drew criticism from fans after it was discovered that some content was cut from the western release, including risqué mini-games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cha cha real smooth
Ah, the "Cha Cha Slide." A simple, groovy party song that somehow wormed its way into every elementary school gym class in America. There's truly nothing better than a choreographed song that just yells out the moves to you, because even someone with two left feet can make that work. The song is truly a staple of organized events, but thanks to a Call of Duty streamer with a sense of humor, the "Cha Cha Slide" has made its way into Warzone 2.0 in the most wholesome, hilarious way.
I had almost completely forgotten the "Cha Cha Slide" even existed until I saw a video of @JhbTeam playing the song over his microphone in the Warzone proximity chat. As any reasonable person would do, a crowd of enemy players formed in front of him to participate in the greatest line dance known to man. It's surprising how well the "Cha Cha Slide" translates to Call of Duty, although I am a bit disappointed no one actually slid when the song instructs them to slide.
https://twitter.com/JhbTeam/status/1594785851242090496
According to JhbTeam, it took them a bunch of tries to get enemy players to stop shooting long enough to get in on the joke. I can absolutely say that whether or not someone is willing to do the "Cha Cha Slide" in Warzone is a litmus test for whether or not they would be my friend. All of these players passed the vibe check. You can even see that JhbTeam is receiving friend requests from the other players while conducting the group in the classic dance, so here's hoping that this will be the start of some beautiful friendships.
As much as I love CoD, I sometimes find that the series, and some of the people who play it, take themselves a bit too seriously sometimes. Seeing something like this is a great reminder that we're all out here to have fun, and getting a win is often less important than getting into the spirit of the game and sharing in a cool moment with others.

Nintendo Japan has released a new trailer for its upcoming fantasy epic Fire Emblem Engage, which launches on Nintendo Switch in January of the new year. The new trailer focuses on the strategic gameplay of the RPG sequel — specifically the magical mechanic known as "Emblem Rings".
The Emblem Ring mechanic allows the protagonist to infuse their skills and abilities with the spirit of other Fire Emblem heroes, whose powers are harnessed within literal rings. Once activated, the Emblem Ring expands upon, boosts, or otherwise enhances certain abilities, as the protagonist takes on the skills and combat arts of their chosen Emblem Ring. In a fashion, it is similar to the Persona mechanic in the series of the same name — except instead of Pixie or Nekomata, you have Celica or Byleth.

As they grow alongside their chosen Fire Emblem rings, the protagonist will inherit weapons, skills, and spells from this roster of classic characters, while building up overdrive abilities and all-new ultimate attacks, defined by the classic characters you have chosen to grow alongside. Six rings are featured in this trailer (Sigurd, Celica, Corrin, Lyn, Byleth, and, of course, Marth. But maybe there will be more rings to be discovered, (or purchased), as the quest continues.
Fire Emblem Engage launches January 20, 2023 on Nintendo Switch.

In case you missed it, Fallout 76 is still around, and still pushing out major free updates. On December 6, the "Nuka-World on Tour" expansion is set to drop,
Bethesda and the powers that be are still pushing the "Fallout 1st" subscription, and it'll apparently offer a new feature called the "ammo storage box." Yep, it's exactly how it sounds, as the team is offering "unlimited space to store all your excess munitions [with the exception of Plasma Cores and Fusion Cores." It's fascinating to see premium elements that impact direct gameplay creep in over time, and how the community responds to it.
Whether you're thinking about jumping back in or you're excited for the update: there's some gameplay and developer commentary you can watch below. One of the best parts of the episode is actually near the start, where Carl McKevitt, senior quest designer, talks about how they carved out an existing area to make room for the actual "tour" in the Nuka-World on Tour location.
We don't really have a clear view of many things coming after this, so we'll see what 2023 brings. Next up, the team promises an update on December 1 with more info on Nuka-World on Tour.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The return of virtual college football is still a ways away
Electronic Arts' return to college football is still a ways off. EA Sports confirms it's aiming for a summer 2024 revival of its college football series.
Speaking to ESPN, EA Sports VP and general manager Daryl Holt said the timing is due to how much of an undertaking this will be.
"That's the best date for us to bring the game that we think is going to meet or exceed our player expectations," Holt told ESPN. "And cover the breadth and scale of what we want in the game. We're trying to build a very immersive college football experience."
Part of this involves use real college football players in the game. Before, using players' likeness in a new EA Sports college football seemed like a non-starter. But as Holt describes it, "the road's open now, but it's still under construction."
This echoes some comments from July 2021 about the possibility of using real players in the virtual experience. An EA source told ESPN that players will be compensated if they appear in-game.

Back to school
EA first announced back in February of 2021 that college football would be returning to the EA Sports fold. Alongside today's window, EA also confirms that both Road to Glory and Dynasty modes will be in store for the new series.
Since we've been without virtual college football since 2013, this news probably sparks some hope for fans of the sport. That being said, player likenesses and compensation still seem to be a lingering question mark. At the very least, a summer 2024 window gives Electronic Arts some time to figure it all out.

The Pokémon series is slowly, painfully evolving its games into open-world exploration games, rather than the linear route to the Pokémon League that they used to be. Pokémon Sword and Shield had wide, open areas, but was still a linear path; Pokémon Legends: Arceus had more open areas, but each one was separate; now, we have Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, the first "proper" open world Pokémon games, which promised us from the beginning that we could do things in any order we liked.

Rainbow Six Siege is about to enter the final season of its seventh year, with the arrival of new event Operation Solar Raid. Not only will this season bring players an intriguing new operator, but it will also add some long-awaited new features to R6S including the long-in-development crossplay and cross-progression.
Rainbow Six Siege players can now link their accounts across multiple platforms via Ubisoft Connect, transferring their rosters, purchased items, currencies, Battle Pas progress, and statistics to all PC and console accounts, (while also earning a free Alpha Pack for the trouble). Once connected, players can start doorkicking with or against their friends across PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms. If, however, this is not your vibe, t…]]></summary>

If you go for the black model, that’s a £65 saving off the RRP, and it’s £95 off if you opt for the white version, which is £45 as well.
£45! And it's full-size to boot. There are always nice savings to be had among Black Friday’s gaming keyboard deals, but even then, the only way you’d normally see a mech board this cheap was if it was secondhand. And had keycaps missing. And was haunted, possibly by some kind of dismembered hand ghost.

This 2022 set is available in paper Magic, and although it isn't something I'm constantly playing, it's a nice thing to come back to, and have sets ready for. It has also been confirmed that Jump Start 2022 would not make it into Arena. Without further ado, onto the card previews!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Nick Popovich was a kid, his parents ran the Sprague Road Tavern in North Royalton, Ohio. "Everything was a dive bar," Popovich, now co-founder and CEO of Monomi Park, says of the drinking scene in the Cleveland suburb. "It was all working-class, like dive-bar kinda thing. Which is basically what this place was." His mum and dad wanted to do up the joint, make it into something resembling what today would be called a sports bar. As part of this plan, Popovich's father added a game room to the building, filled with pool tables, shuffleboard ("As a result I'm hugely into shuffleboard", Popovich notes) and most importantly of all, a rotating stock of arcade machines.
Back in the day, explains Popovich, the cabinet was the expensive thing. So his dad would find a cheap cabinet, they'd put in a cheap second-hand board and monitor, and paint the outside to make it look like the official version of the game. To the regulars drinking and shooting pool, it didn't matter that the arcade cabinet looked like a bootleg – that Donkey Kong was just a picture of a monkey that Popovich Senior had stencilled onto the side of the cabinet. What mattered was that the cabinet did what it needed to do, and that the game inside was legit. This line of thinking, of making something only as good as it needs to be, was an essential component in the development of Slime Rancher, Monomi Park's massively successful sci-fi farming simulator. "The original Slime Rancher cheated. A very small group of people made it, and it looks like many more people than that made it," Popovich says.

Set in a post-apocalypse with no women, you play as Brad who one day finds an abandoned baby girl, names her Buddy, and raises her in secret. Years later, Buddy is kidnapped by a militia group and Brad sets off to rescue her. When you put it like that, the story is pretty basic, but it’s so much more than it seems. The absurdist comical world together with the awful decisions forced upon you make this a special kind of bleak RPG.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[And you won't believe who is bringing the goods
The legendary Japanese release Tetris: The Grand Master, considered by aficionados the most difficult release in the iconic block-dropping series, is finally coming to PS4 and Nintendo Switch. The almost mythic puzzler will launch in the near future courtesy of, of all people, Hamster's Arcade Archives range.
Developed by Arika, and originally released in Japanese arcades in 1998, Tetris: The Grand Master follows the typical ruleset of Alexey Pajitnov genre-defining classic, but offers up a staggering 999 levels of play and introduces the "20G" mechanic beloved by dedicated players. Essentially, this mechanic sees blocks appear directly on top of the wall, offering the player a split-second to effectively move them into place.
Check out the wild action in the classic run below, courtesy of YouTuber Sega-16.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEzvyMI4I9I
Tetris: The Grand Master is recognized by the Tetris community's expert players and speedrunners — those who you see performing almost reality-breaking feats of organization at events such as Awesome Games Done Quick, (or alternately, my friend Jonster, whose own Tetris skills leave me utterly flabbergasted. Look how happy he is in this tweet!). While TGM would receive several readily available sequels, this Arcade Archives release will represent the original's first-ever home release outside of Japan, and as such is a major reckoning for Tetris players.
No date has been revealed for the title's launch but, as regular readers will be aware, we cover each and every Arcade Archives release right here on Destructoid, and have done so for many, many years. Thus, we'll be sure to let you know when TGM is headed to a platform near you. In the meantime, get practicing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Creepy cutouts.
Thunderful has announced that it will be bringing Space Lizard Studios' creepy cardboard roguelite, Paper Cut Mansion, to the Switch on 5th December, 2022.
There are many of us out there who find the aesthetic design of Paper Mario somewhat off-putting - just look at those ever-staring those cold dead eyes. Paper Cut Mansion takes these chills and looks to dial them up to 11, with a spooky mystery being the central aim behind exploring the creepy hand-made mansion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been playing Pokémon Violet over the past few days, and fortunately I haven’t suffered many of the glaring tech issues that have gone viral since launch. There are fairly frequent frame drops and a few camera glitches, but nothing that’s ruined my experience just yet. What has caught my eye, though, is simply how small some of the Pokémon are in Paldea. They’re tiny little things, and the onslaught of oddly small critters reminds me that sometimes, size really does matter.

As Monster Hunter Rise continues to trek into 2023, we have one more major patch scheduled for November 24.
"Version .13.0.0" will be implemented this week, and will add more rewards, monsters, quests, and cosmetic paid DLC. After that, we have the "winter 2023" Free Title Update 4, followed by another one in the spring.
There's way, way more on the game's official site: but you can read the highlights below. Thankfully, Capcom has continued the tradition of breaking down individual items that will apply to the game as a whole, and stuff that only will work if you have the Sunbreak DLC.

Encountering and catching a shiny Pokémon is undoubtedly one of the most satisfying moments of any Pokémon game. The feature returns with Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, of course, but it appears that an exploit has been discovered that, upon discovering a shiny Pokémon under specific conditions, will let you catch it over and over again.
As spotted by the folks over at VGC, the exploit comes via YouTube channel Austin John Plays, who goes over the very specific conditions that must be met in order to carry out the exploit. In a nutshell, you'll need to be able to hightail it to a nearby open town (by "open", this means one that doesn't contain a loading door) after you've caught the shiny. Keep in mind that a closed town or an open Pokémon Centre won't yield the same results.

One thing I hadn’t thought of it as, at least until now, was a dance simulator, but then I’ve never used Tiktok. A cunning Warzone 2 player has managed to convince the enemy team to abandon their hostilities and indulge in a spot of shuffling to DJ Casper’s classic turn of the millennium hit Cha Cha Slide. It’s an odd choice, particularly considering they’re jumping around in a cemetery, but each to their own.

Our odyssey was one of carrots and boars, half-naked sails and bees.

Following on from recent rumors and speculation, publisher Ubisoft has confirmed that it will be rolling out its catalog of recent releases in a return to Valve's popular PC storefront, Steam. The lead title will be Viking adventure Assassin's Creed Valhalla, which will arrive on the Steam platform December 6.
"We're constantly evaluating how to bring our games to different audiences wherever they are, while providing a consistent player ecosystem through Ubisoft Connect," said Ubisoft in a statement to Eurogamer. "Assassin's Creed Valhalla, Anno 1800, and Roller Champions are among the Ubisoft titles that will be releasing on Steam."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eCw20F0zmA
Ubisoft had been regularly releasing its games on Steam since the platform's advent back in 2003, but chose to separate from the storefront in 2019 to publish its wares through its in-house Uplay service — and then later via Epic Games Store. Ubisoft's return to Steam was heralded by several database leaks spotted by known Ubisoft leaker YoobieRE, before the publisher finally confirmed its storefront comeback yesterday.
Assassin's Creed Valhalla, originally launched in 2020, is getting set to receive its final DLC update — titled The Last Chapter. As such, this is a smart time for the game to make its Steam debut, allowing new players to pick up the epic adventure alongside all previously released DLC content. The next Assassin's Creed title, Mirage, is currently in development at Ubisoft.

Pokémon Scarlet and Violet are now out in the wild and people sure are playing and posting about 'em.
While our own review of the latest generation was relatively positive, heaping praise on the games' new open world setting, the new Let's Go feature, and its heartfelt story moments, we also couldn't ignore the fact that they just don't seem to be ready for the prime time. Dodgy visuals, jittering frame rates, and a heap of bugs and glitches point to Scarlet and Violet being some of the least polished games in the franchise's history.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m rounding up Steam Deck-ready microSD sales over in our best early Black Friday SSD deals hub, but thought it worth highlighting the Samsung Pro Plus more directly. This is, of all the ones I’ve tried, the best microSD card for Valve’s handheld PC, and it’s currently enjoying some discounts in both the UK and US.


These focus on the 256GB and 512GB models, the latter being the roomiest capacity that the Pro Plus comes in. Assuming that you do indeed find yourself constrained by your Deck’s own SSD, I’d suggest aiming for 512GB if you can – 256GB  will hold a fair few games but might also fill up fast if you’re installing a lot of gigabyte-hogging AAA games. Then again, an extra 256GB might be fine otherwise – many of the best Steam Deck games, like Vampire Survivors, have a tiny installation footprint. Your call.

There's a new gun in town in Player First Games' madcap smack-'em-up MultiVersus, as classic Looney Toons character Marvin the Martian joins the roster as the first DLC combatant of Season 2. Marvin is available to purchase today on all platforms for 3000 Gold or 700 Gleamium.
Debuting in the 1948 Bugs Bunny cartoon Haredevil Hare, Marvin the Martian is a diminutive intergalactic warrior with a bad attitude and an amusingly bureaucratic voice. Marvin would appear in several shorts with Bugs, but is perhaps best known for his ongoing, decades-long feud with Daffy Duck's space-age alter-ego, Duck Dodgers.
As a foil to both Bugs Bunny and Duck Dodgers, Marvin is recognized by his fast-moving legs and his tendency to get "verrrrry angry indeed" when things are not going h…]]></summary>

Having heard of what is going to be made available in Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak's upcoming Title Update 3 via an announcement last week, Capcom has now taken to the game's official site to share the patch notes that we can expect to see installed on 24th November.
The rather meaty patch notes (thanks, Nintendo Everything) mark the addition of new monsters to the game as well as the ability for followers to accompany you in more quests. There is also mention of new weapons, armour, skills and prizes which will be added to the game alongside the usual bug fixes and adjustments.

Legendary game creator Masahiro Sakurai continues to throw out one video after the next on his YouTube channel 'Masahiro Sakurai on Creating Games', and his latest effort delves into the development of the GameCube classic Super Smash Bros. Melee.
Widely regarded as one of, if not the best entry to the Smash Bros. franchise, Melee launched on the GameCube back in 2001, serving as a direct sequel to the N64 original and introducing new playable characters such as Bowser, Falco, and Ganondorf. It was highly praised for its slick gameplay, wide variety of game modes, and a comprehensive collectible trophy system.

Ah, the things that people will do while waiting for a localisation. Though it seems unlikely that Mother 3 will ever officially come to consoles out west, we can at least comfortably say that its fanbase has now discovered every last one of the game's details - right down to the wood used on the logo.
Symbolic of Porky's takeover of the Nowhere Islands (man vs. nature and all that) the Mother 3 logo depicts the title in a combination of metal and wood. There are many of us who have never looked at this image close enough to really see whether it was real wood in the first place. Then there are people like @PineappleCarl3, who not only has looked closely enough to see that it is indeed real wood, but has gone on to study tree pictures until they found the mother tree - the wood used in the logo.

What this 4K gaming monitor lacks in brand recognition, it makes up for in smooth performance, despite being absolutely dirt cheap – and you can pick one up for yourself, brand new, in the early Black Friday sales.


This is a UK-only deal, as I can’t find as the eiQ-32M4K144FS on sale at all from a US retailer. But I can’t stress enough what good value this monitor is for £380: that’s 1440p money, usually, but the eiQ-32M4K144FS is a full 3840x2160 display with a generous 32in of screen space. Between the 144Hz refresh rate and AMD FreeSync/Nvidia G-Sync support, it’s also remarkably stacked for gaming features; I’ve seen for myself how well G-Sync, for instance, eliminates screen tearing on the IPS panel.

I got into the works of Yasuhiro Nightow at a really young age. Pretty much directly after being mesmerized by Trigun, I knew I had to follow his work through any means necessary. That loyalty paid off when he got involved in video game development: partially helming the Gungrave franchise, which became an anime based on the first game.
He's had a crazy career, and it isn't done yet based on Gungrave Gore (and that upcoming Trigun anime).

Gripping the man around the neck, Ezio holds him steady so that a nearby thief - hired at a fixed rate of 150 florins for an indefinite period of rooftop troublemaking - can take a free swing at his exposed abdomen. The sword connects, though not with its intended target. Instead it catches Ezio in the shoulder, knocking the assassin off-balance. He teeters backward across the tiles and over the lip of the building, falling three floors into the packed street below. The farce of it all is worth every one of the twelve hitpoints he loses in the process.

Switch emulation is a thing, and it's something Nintendo obviously isn't happy about - with a lot of first-party releases often leaking ahead of official street dates, and in most cases, running on other devices at much higher resolutions and frame rates.
Nintendo's taken action in the past against piracy and emulation, and most recently it's gone on another DMCA spree. Following the leak of Pokémon Scarlet & Violet, Nintendo is now targeting images of Switch games being published on the website SteamGridDB.

There are a lot of Pokemon games. This should come as no surprise, given Pokemon is the largest media franchise in the world and has over 25 years of history. Still, if you haven’t followed the series since its first generation, deciphering it can be overwhelming.
The mainline Pokemon series is classified by “generations." This is because many Pokemon games are virtually identical, save for a handful of differences or a few enhancements. For example, Pokemon Scarlet & Violet are similar enough that only hardcore fans will play both. This can get especially confusing once you include remakes and rereleases of past Pokemon games. There are over ten games that could be considered “Generation 1,” and you only need to play one of them!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sin brings a flag and some meat to the party
A familiar face is returning to Guilty Gear with a fresh look. Sin Kiske is the next fighter to join the Guilty Gear Strive roster as part of its Season 2 pass, arriving on November 24.
Sin, the son of Guilty Gear mainstay Ky Kiske and Dizzy, shows up here as the "ever-growing wild boy." He's still wielding his flag weapon. And yes, he can still pull out a hunk of meat to chow down on, mid-match.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQoNLBJ0xSc
The younger Kiske also makes mention of his mom, lending more fuel to the fire that we might see Dizzy alongside Sin Kiske in Guilty Gear Strive. As for gameplay, IGN had a special presentation revealing the new trailer, as well as some gameplay demonstration of Sin Kiske and how he's changed for Strive.
He's got a special bar, a stamina bar, rather than his hunger meter. He seems to have some interesting potential in his follow-ups using this gauge, as well as a buff he can pick up from chowing down on some grub mid-fight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMfsw4BwiNI
The fight continues
At the end of the Sin trailer, we also get confirmation that two more fighters are due out in 2023 as part of Season 2. It looks like the content roadmap shown off earlier this year is holding up.
Crossplay is also hopefully getting officially integrated soon, as its held some beta tests already. Considering an Xbox release is set for next spring, that will be of interest to the new platform's players.
As for the last remaining fighters? Well, Slayer seems to be a much-requested addition, and Dizzy getting mentioned in the trailer plants some speculation. I've really liked the original characters so far too, though, so I hope there's at least one more newcomer in the pipeline for Strive.

While the Pokemon series has had multiplayer since Red and Blue, it's been mostly just trading and battling. The Let's Go series might have allowed dual Trainers, but not individual avatars brought in from their own games and worlds.
In Scarlet and Violet, Game Freak opens the doors for players to form groups and explore the open world together. Up to four Trainers can link up using a room code and play in one instance together, via the Po…]]></summary>

The Wii U turned 10 last week, and boy oh boy, what a weird-and-sad-but-endearing flop that was. It sold about 1/10 as well as its predecessor, and common consensus is, people passed on it because they didn't realize it was a new system. I think the real problem though was that people felt like it was just another Wii thing. They could have just asked Google, or a store clerk, if it was a new console, but they didn't. They were too bored to.
By 2012, the Wii brand instantly put people to sleep. The market had been flooded with so much Wii stuff by that time that anything that said "Wii" on it was instantly sent to the "ignore" section of people's brains.

Each new generation of Pokémon promises changes and iterations to the long-standing franchise formula. Pokémon Scarlet and Violet kick off the ninth generation of Pokémon games, offering some of the biggest changes to date. An open world, four-player co-op, and other additions effectively push the series forward in meaningful ways, but the technical shortcomings often break immersion and temper an otherwise strong Pokémon game.
The Pokémon formula remains mostly intact through Scarlet and Violet. Your main goals still involve catching, training,…]]></summary>

There is absolutely nothing more frustrating than playing your very best in an online game, only to be taken out by some technical issue that's outside of your control. How does the old saying go? Oh yeah: "Video games don't cause violence, lag does." Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0 players are in a world of hurt right now, but not because of lag; there's a bug floating around right now that causes enemies to become completely invisible. I can't think of anything more rage-inducing than that.
Originally reported by PCGamesN, there's currently a lot of mystery surrounding the issue. Players can't seem to find any reason for the Warzone bug, or a way to trigger it in game. Some are even calling foul play, suggesting that hackers might be using the bug as an exploit int…]]></summary>

Pokemon Scarlet and Violet are out in the wild, and players have been discovering all kinds of weird glitches and tricks. One in particular involves not just a copy of the new Pokemon, but two controllers too.
As discovered and shared over on Reddit, you can use two controllers to make your Trainer in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet run faster than usual. Others, including myself, have since verified that it does indeed work.
This seems to really only work in handheld mode, in my experience. And likely best with Pro Controller and attached Joy-Cons as the configuration; the Reddit video uses Joy-Cons, but a Pro and Joy-Con combo felt better to use in my case.

It's a bit finicky to manage, as you have to tilt both sticks at an angle. But it definitely felt li…]]></summary>

Note: This Cloud Version of Resident Evil 2 was tested on 100MB UW Broadband over WiFi and wired ethernet cable, along with a 5G mobile connection.

Following up Resident Evil 2 — whether it’s the 1998 original or the 2019 remake — is no easy task. Indeed, in the run-up to the launch of the PlayStation 2, Capcom found itself in a tricky position: the company was in the midst of producing multiple Resident Evil projects, yet none would be ready for Sony’s next console debut. As such, it saw fit to upgrade a smaller, spin-off title to mainline status in order to satiate a vastly expanding audience, and so Resident Evil 3: Nemesis was born.

While Good Smile Company's catalogue of delightful Nendoroid toys is well into three figures, it is staggering to believe that WayForward's cute genie gal Shantae was still yet to join the roster. After all, The Half-Genie Hero seems custom designed for such pint-sized stylization.

Well, after years of longing, Good Smile has finally opened pre-orders on the new Nendo of the purple-haired wonder, ready to come dancing out of the screen and onto your toy shelf. As is the case for all Nendoroids, Shantae stands around four inches in height and features dynamically poseable limbs, so you can have our gal cutting a rug in any way you choose.
In terms of accessories, Shantae comes complete with a stand and three separate faceplates, offering her a cute smile, a cheeky wink, or as much of an "angry face" as she can muster... Somebody gon' get a hair-whuppin'. Shantae also has alternate arms posed for dancing, pointing, and fireball flinging, as well as a replacement ponytail in freeform whip action. As the cherry on the cake, Shantae is accompanied by a teeny figurine, reflecting her Monkey form from the smash hit series. Adorbs.

If you fancy inviting the Shantae Nendo into your home, then she is available to pre-order from the Good Smile Co. website and other dedicated merch retailers, priced at ¥8,900, (roughly $57), not including shipping or any potential customs charges. The Shantae Nendoroid is expected to ship in summer 2023.
Now we just need to get Rotty, Risky and other friends in the mix.

D3 Publisher has released a 10-minute gameplay video of its anime hack 'n' slash adventure Samurai Maiden. Developed by Japanese studio Shade, the action-packed tale of swords and sorcery will hit PlayStation, PC and Nintendo Switch platforms in early December.
Utilizing the time-honored marriage of anime schoolgirls and time travel, Samurai Maiden sees a young lass from the 21st Century whisked back to Sengoku era Japan where, accompanied by her newfound friends, our hero takes up steel against a deathly army of monsters and ghouls. As she battles her way through the underworld, our young maiden will mastery the ancient art of the samurai, defeating ungodly creatures on her journey to return to her own time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZOnAzJOXvI&t
Despite the overall cheesiness of the characters and setup, I have to admit that I think Samurai Maiden looks pretty sharp (pun fully intended). I'm digging the super-colorful locations, the crazy-creepy enemy design, and the slick-looking combat. The visual effects also aren't to be sniffed at. The action appears to move both smoothly and with precision, and overall it looks like it could be a fun, low-key, way to spend a lazy weekend... Even if you do gotta roll your eyes a little at the game's "kiss other girls to power up" mechanic.
I mean, that's never worked for me, and I've tried it over three times in my life.
Samurai Maiden launches worldwide, December 8, on PlayStation, PC, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's all about perspective
Fun news for puzzle fans: Pillow Castle Games' extraordinarily smart adventure Superliminal is now available on ninth-gen platforms PS5 and Xbox Series X, following on from its critically acclaimed 2019 release on PC and consoles.
For those less inclined, Superliminal, (also known as Museum of Simulation Technology), is a first-person adventure title in the vein of Valve's iconic puzzler Portal, and follows a protagonist as they attempt to escape from a looping dream sequence, guided by the voice of a mysterious overseer. Superliminal's "kick" lies in the concept of optical illusions, and tasks the player with escaping a series of chambers utilizing elements of forced perspective, object scaling, and the manipulation of the third dimension in order to craft a path to the exit.
Better demonstrated than explained, you can check out the action in the trailer below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KY87ldajFY
The new PS5/Xbox Series X port of Superliminal supports 4K resolution with a framerate of 60 frames per second. In addition, the ports receive the recently patched "Developer mode", which includes commentary from the team at Pillow Castle, and "Challenge Mode", which limits the number of movements that the player is allowed to perform in each chamber, requiring a little more forethought before attempting each topsy-turvy situation. Best of all, these new editions are now available as free upgrades for all players who already own Superliminal on PS4 and Xbox One respectively.
Now go get your brain melted.
Superliminal is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

Team Ninja is not done with its flagship franchises Ninja Gaiden and Dead or Alive — What's more, it appears that the Japanese developer is actually making preparations to reboot both franchises for something of a fresh start for both long-running series.
At the G-Star conference in Busan, South Korea this weekend, Team Ninja President Fumihiko Yasuda held a panel on the future of the studio. As part of Yasuda's presentation, a slide was shown that featured logos and images from action RPG franchise Ninja Gaiden, and 3D scrapper series Dead or Alive, complete with a header of "Reboots of popular series". A translation from Ruliweb suggests that Yasuda said news of these projects would arrive "as soon as possible".

It’s a 12-player crazy golf game that dials up the crazy, and as we soon found back in those pre-vaccine days, one that reaches a whole other level of club-and-ball chaos with a single settings tweak.


See, with ball collision switched off, Golf With Your Friends is pretty fun. The courses are oversized and fantastical, and because everyone’s balls are in play at the same time, you get all the light-hearted competition of a real putting contest without waiting for the person in front to take their turn. All fine and dandy. Turn ball collision on, however, and it becomes outright pandemonium.

This is one of the best early Black Friday PC deals we've spotted so far, and well worth picking up for games that benefit from controller input, like those in the racing, platformer, action and fighting genres. Of course, it's also an essential pickup if you like playing around with emulators, and of course works on two generations of Xbox consoles as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A notebook and a highlighter set
Another first part Nintendo release: another My Nintendo reward. This time Pokemon Scarlet and Violet is getting an expected physical item release, and it actually entails two things.
Here's all we know at the moment:
"Two new rewards - Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Violet partner pokemon mini-notebook and Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Violet violet highlighter with case are coming. Stay tuned for more info."

The notebook is adorned with iconography of the new generational starters, and the highlighter set is themed after the two legendaries (and the coloring of Scarlet and Violet itself). It's hard to say what point value these could clock in at when they hit the system, but count on at least 500 Platinum Points per item.
Also, it's very important to note that nearly all Pokemon items (even the crossover keychain with Splatoon 3) "sell out" of My Nintendo stock shortly after they launch. Make sure you have the points for the one(s) you want!
As a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked.

As MultiVersus tweeter and data miner LaisulMV noted, to complete the original Season 1 battle pass you’d need to accrue 47,650 XP to make it from Level 1 to Level 50. Season 2’s battle pass, on the other hand, requires a total of 87,450 XP. Levels 41-50 alone take almost as much effort as the first season’s entire battle pass, weighing in at 46,200 XP.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Morning everyone. Black Friday 2022 is upon us and we’ll be covering it a bit differently to previous years – better, hopefully, albeit still in a way where an explanation might help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was once a regular Counter-Strike player, but that was almost twenty years ago. What's remarkable about Valve's team shooter is how little its fundamentals have changed over those twenty years. The AWP and M4A1?

For example, a recent update turned previously placid Sims into moody, argumentative jerks who were constantly scrapping with one another. That sounds great to me, although if you disagree there's bad news. EA Maxis say that their fix, intended to release this past week, has been delayed until early December.

        <updated>2022-11-18T18:25:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Legendary Sonic designer and Balan Wonderworld director Yuji Naka has been arrested in Tokyo in connection to an insider trading investigation involving the reveal of a Dragon Quest game. 
According to the Japanese news outlet FNN, the last 24 hours saw ex-Square Enix employee Taisuke Sazaki and his friend Fumiaki Suzuki arrested on suspicion for insider trading. In 2020, developer Aiming had been set to announce its mobile game Dragon Quest Tact, and Sazaki and Suzuki are alleged to have known details about the game before it was publicly revealed. The pair reportedly purchased a combined 162,000 shares of Aiming for roughly 47.2 million yen (or over $335,000) in advance with the intent of profiting on a potentially higher stock price stemming from Tact’s announcement. 
Yuji Naka is now suspected of being involved in this scandal as well. He is accused of purchasing 10,000 shares worth 2.8 million yen (roughly $20,000) in Aiming for the same purpose of profiting from Tact’s reveal. Naka was apprehended by Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office, and the investigation is ongoing. It’s currently unknown if the suspects still own their shares or if they already sold them.  
This is the second major controversy Naka has found himself involved with this year. In April, Naka publicly blasted Square Enix on Twitter over his removal as director from Balan Wonderworld prior to its release, blaming Square for the game’s critical failure. This outburst came after the conclusion of a lawsuit he’d previously filed against the publisher. Naka is best known as the lead programmer behind the original Sonic the Hedgehog games for Sega Genesis and Nights into Dreams.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Each time we start up a new mainline Pokémon game, we begin our journey with a choice. Sometimes it's an easy one. Sometimes it's agonizing. But regardless of where on that spectrum each generation lands for you, the general choice remains the same: grass, water, or fire. Thanks to the rock-paper-scissors nature of the types on offer, no one option is, by definition, superior. For Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, those types are represented through Sprigatito, Quaxly, and Fuecoco.
Now that Pokémon Scarlet and Violet are officially out in the wild, we want to know which starter you're rolling with. While you're at it, which factors go into making your decision? Do you always choose that type? Did you research what the final evolutions look like? Or do you just go with your gut based on how they look and behave?
Let us know if you're kicking off your Paldea region adventure with Sprigatito, Quaxly, or Fuecoco in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anyone who's had to physically stop me from banging on about Black Sails will confirm that I love a bit of piracy. Games mostly don't do it justice at all, either making "piracy" shorthand for "mindless omnicide for no reason" or slapping a parroty theme onto a generic action game.
Buccaneers! isn't primarily a piracy game, but they're one of its four factions. It doesn’t try to be more than a naval combat and light action RPG either, let alone the “real” pirate game I dearly want, but I can’t hold that against it either.  If I was being reductive, I'd call it a budget hybrid of Sea Of Thieves and Sid Meier's Pirates By Sid Meier Aged 33 And 3/4. It's probably unfair to set such high expectations, but the core design is compelling and enjoyable enough to merit it.

I'm saying this to emphasise that I loathe singiing the praises of anything even tangentially related to Marvel, without also revealing that I have stashed a steel chair and bag of thumbtacks under the ring as a surprise attack against Kevin Feige.
Spider-Man is about as Marvel-related as you can get. I said back when the remaster of Insomniac's first Spider-Man game came to PC that the reason to not buy it was that Miles Morales was coming to PC in a few months. A few months has become now. And I must own that Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales is a good game. It's a big, bold action adventure full of heroics and quips, and it's still the better Spider-Man game. I think a large part of that is because it's shorter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft celebrated Spinter Cell’s 20th anniversary by releasing a new video reflecting on the series and discussing its upcoming remake. The video revealed some details on the project’s status as well as some early images. 


The Splinter Cell remake was first announced last December, but we’ve known very little about it other than it’s being rebuilt from scratch in Snowdrop Engine (used to make The Division, Mario + Rabbids games). In the video, the team states the experience will be identical to the 2002 title but it wants to implement improvements and features introduced in later Splinter Cell titles as well as smooth some rough edges. For example, the team wants to give players more opportunities to de-escalate situations when things go awry instead of getting an instant Game Over. 
The dev team also shares that the project is still in the early prototyping phase. As such, the studio will be going dark “for a while” to focus on making the game, so it will likely be a good while before we hear anything substantial about the remake again. In the meantime, you can take a look at the gallery of new concept images shared during the presentation below. 

Splinter Cell doesn’t have a release window or announced platforms. This remake is only one of many on the horizon, and you can keep up with all of them by checking our big list of upcoming video game remakes.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hot on the heels of their Solium Infernum announcement at the end of September, the studio behind strategy RPG Armello have announced another new game they're working on during tonight's PC Gaming Show Preview stream. It's called Jumplight Odyssey (or "J-Lo" for short, as League Of Geeks studio director and co-founder Trent Kusters affectionately referred to it during an early preview presentation I attended last week), and it's a starship roguelite colony sim that has big 70s anime vibes. Specifically, Star Blazers, the English adaptation of Leiji Matsumoto's seminal Space Battleship Yamato, with which Jumplight shares a lot of its core visual DNA. 
In it, you play as Princess Euphora, who's on a mission to save her people from the space conquering Zutopans, jumping from planet to planet in search of their Forever Star. It's not due to arrive in early access until sometime next year, but I've seen a sneak peek of it running in an early alpha build, and lemme tell ya. FTL, Rimworld and Two Point Hospital likers (bear with me on that last one) are going to want to take note of this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever had a real-life experience where you’re something like 90% sure you’re actually in a horror film? Answers in the comments, please. Now, imagine that, but also someone asks you to pop your phone in a lockbox, you know, for safekeeping. Also, they say something like “You won’t need it where we’re going” and then do a murder wink at an imaginary camera. Something quite similar to this happens to our ill-fated documentary crew early in The Devil In Me. 'Aha!' I thought. Supermassive are being knowingly, playfully tropey again. Great. These games are best when they lean into the cheese like a drunk buffet guest, and I was pumped to watch it stumble around a schlocky murder party and get baked brie all over the elbows of its best tux.
For those yet to stick their snout into Supermassive’s truffle-trove of horror offerings, the basic premise of these narrative adventure games can best be summarised: What if shouting at the screen to try and stop idiot characters performing horror film no-nos actually worked? The formula was both invented and, miraculously, perfected in 2015’s Until Dawn. Since then, the studio have released three ‘episodic’ (although narratively independent) Dark Pictures titles, and The Quarry, all of which can best be summarised: Like Until Dawn, but not as good.

You can get a glimpse of some of the Karakuri battles that Wild Hearts contains in the trailer below, including a rather awesome looking monocycle and a furious monkey with a very nasty skin condition.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Saints Row, a reboot for the series, was released back in August and while some players were happy with the end result, others were not. And now, due to Saints Row failing to meet the full expectations of Embracer Group, developer Volition will become part of Gearbox Entertainment. 
This news comes by way of Video Games Chronicle, which reports that Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors discussed this transition in a statement released alongside the company's second-quarter earning results. 


"The reception of Saints Row did not meet the full expectations and left the fanbase partially polarized," Wingefores said in the statement. "The game development studio, Volition, has been working hard to improve the player experience. Financially, Saints Row has performed in line with management expectations in the quarter. Going forward, Volition will transition to become part of Gearbox which has all the tools, including an experienced management team in the US, to create future success at Volition."
Wingefors notes that this is the first time the company has performed an "internal group transfer where we transfer a major studio between operative groups," but says that "it is not necessarily the last." 
Saints Row currently sits at 61 on Metacritic (for the PlayStation 5 version), with a user score of 2.1. Game Informer gave the game an 8.5 out of 10 in its review and you can read what we liked about Saints Row here.

Originally due out on February 3, this upcoming zombie romp will now hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC on April 28. It's a delay of roughly 12 weeks, which isn't too much longer considering fans have been waiting close to a decade for this sequel. As for why developer Dambuster Studios and publisher Deep Silver have delayed Dead Island 2, the team wants more time to ensure the game is the best it can be at launch. 
Here's the full statement on the delay:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A short teaser for the next horror game in Supermassive’s The Dark Pictures Anthology series has emerged on YouTube. Called Directive 8020, it seems like this one is going full sci-fi and heading all the way into outer space, Event Horizon style. The teaser video seems to have been taken from the end of an advance copy of its predecessor The Devil In Me, which is released tomorrow so keep your eyes peeled for our review. Supermassive will likely follow up with an official teaser after The Devil In Me's out. You can watch the leaked teaser below, if you’re not spooked by the possibility of spoilers.

Bethesda tweeted their statement last night, calling Gordon’s lengthy post explaining his experience working on Doom Eternal’s soundtrack "a one-sided and unjust account of an irreparable professional relationship”. Gordon had replied to an open letter published on Reddit by id Software executive producer Marty Stratton, more than two years after Stratton’s letter was posted online.

First, the online servers are not yet available, and with four-player co-op serving as a big addition to the series, we want to fully test it out before delivering our review. I also just want a tad more time with the game before slapping a score on it; I've finished most of the main story, but I haven't fully explored the end and post-game content.

Normally a full keycap set of PrismCaps will cost you $30, but as an early Black Friday deal you can find these keycaps for 50% off - just $15. At that price, these are in impulse buy territory for me, as they'll provide an immediate uplift over your existing keycaps and last for decades.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The long-awaited Pokémon Trading Card Game Live app is now available in beta worldwide on PC and mobile devices after a staggered rollout last month. The successor to the now-defunct Pokémon Trading Card Game Online game has been in the works since its reveal last September. 
For fans of the previous mobile game, TCG Live aims to offer a more polished, robust digital card game experience. You can collect cards either by scanning code cards or purchasing booster packs with digital currency earned in-game by completing quests and working through battle passes.
Players represent themselves with a customizable avatar and can challenge players to matches across the globe. It also sports a much sleeker presentation. Essentially, TCG Live is positioned as the Pokémon equivalent of modern card game apps such as Magic: The Gathering Arena and Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel. Check out the original teaser trailer below.


Since the game is in beta, expect updates to roll out over the coming weeks/months. Pokémon TCG Live can be played on iOS, Android, and is downloadable on PC.]]></summary>

It sounds like you’ll only get a short while to step into this other, as yet unnamed character’s shoes, however, as they’re only playable in the early game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So. Funny thing about our RTX 4080 review: I sort of don’t have time for it. We are amidst the busiest few weeks in PC gaming hardware for at least four years, with major product launches all round (from its rival Radeon RX 7900 XT to Intel’s 13th Gen CPUs) and a neverending stream of other components and peripherals that still need appraising. Also, I get the impression that if I don’t do more Black Friday stuff, senior ReedPop figures will show up at my flat and start taking my fingers with chisels.


Still, there will no doubt be potential graphics card upgrade-makers looking at the RTX 4080 to see if it’s more of a palatable purchase than the RTX 4090. That vanguard of Nvidia’s next-gen Ada Lovelace architecture is by far the most powerful GPU I’ve ever tested, and introduced a very cool new feature in DLSS 3, but with prices starting £1679 / $1599 it’s just not a sensible option. And since I did have an RTX 4080 show up at the last minute – Asus’ customised ROG Strix GeForce RTX 4080 OC Edition – I can at least provide some quick benchmarks and initial thoughts as to whether it’s a better deal.

I've never really graduated from storing my clothes on the floor like I did when I was 16 (every 12 weeks or so I tidy them all away and then start the process again). It is cold, so I have a pink blanket that is my work chair blanket, which I have had for at least five years and I cannot remember washing. I store things using a cunning system of my own devising i.e. the cellotape has been behind the left monitor on my desk for months, so by the transitive property that is now Where The Cellotape Goes. If I put the cellotape somewhere more logical, like in a drawer for keeping things like cellotape, then I would forget where the cellotape is. 
The area in and around my desk is a nonsensical melange of things, a place that would probably deal you +12 psychological damage if you approached without the necessary preparation. But after playing A Little To The Left I can rebrand my desk as being a deliberate series of whimsical organising puzzles.

Drinking too much wine and playing the piano badly and getting chased out of a hotel lobby is easy — most of us could do it — but it takes a degree of talent to sound entertainingly rubbish.
Likewise, Goat Simulator 3 is an expertly janky game about being a silly little goat and running around causing mischief. It’s a dumb, open-world simulator in which bugs have been promoted to features. Your goat is a horrible little kooky guy who mostly interacts with the environment through the medium of headbutts and licking. They’ll occasionally be catapulted into the sky by a spasmodic police car, or have their head irreversibly enlarged by a special machine, or bleat so hard at a beanstalk that it vanishes into thin air, but even during the most chaotic moments things feel entirely under control. As though the invisible hand of a very, very tired QA tester is always on the tiller.

You can expect 18 more leaders spread out over six DLC pack releases between November 21st and March 2023, 12 of whom are new leaders. Another six will be “new takes” on existing leaders from previous games in the Civ series.

I vaguely recall booting it up once, perhaps a decade ago, and getting no further than its main menu. Painkiller was destined to rot in a digital purgatory of my own design forever, an unassuming icon that I would scroll past on my way to reinstall Destiny 2 for the 12th time without giving it a single thought. That is, until Valve finally sent me my Steam Deck.

It’s an odd pairing on paper - a detective thriller about a string of grisly murders set in the quaint countryside of 16th-century Bavaria - but, surprisingly, this coupling is a match made in heaven. 
Its captivating story of conspiracy and murder is as rich and dense as its setting, and it's clearly made by a passionate team who have a deep love for the period. Playing Pentiment feels like riffling through the painterly pages of a medieval manuscript, but instead of finding the written gospel of saints and sinners, there are tales of angry farmers, greedy landowners, church scandals, religious turmoil, and murder. Fundamentally though, it's a historical tale about faith and truth, and the lengths that people are willing to go to preserve them.

I say with great affection: it feels (and looks) like it could have been a Flash game on Newgrounds. Plus it's only £4.

The best stories in video games manage to fuse narrative, art, and gameplay in a way that elevates all three. Pentiment, the latest from Obsidian Entertainment, is a perfect example of this, telling a deep, complex story about religion, truth, and history in the form of a book, which the player experiences as it’s being written. Despite a few sections with inconsistent pacing, it’s a must-play for fans of adventure games.
Pentiment tells the story of traveling artist Andreas Maler and his time spent in Tassing, a fictional town …]]></summary>

These two games represent the start of Generation 9, which will surely bring its own competitive meta, anime, and even Pokémon card series to the franchise, and we can't wait. However, there's still some time before we actually get to play these games, so for now, we'll be scanning every second of the reveal trailer (and subsequent trailers) for new locales, features, and of course, Pokémon. 


As any Pokémon player knows, with each generation comes two games to choose from. This time around, it's Scarlet and Violet (is this a callback to Red and Blue, perhaps?). With two different versions, there are always some differences between…]]></summary>

As you can see, this trailer is packed with lots of new looks at characters we'll meet in Paldea, new Pokémon to catch and party up with, and more.

Somerville begins with a peek into the life of a young family and their dog. Everyone fell asleep watching TV on the couch, but the curious toddler gets themselves into some inconsequential trouble, forcing the family into their routine. Both the child and dog need to be fed and the kitchen needs to be cleaned, but something feels off. In an explosive moment that truly caught me by surprise, the family is suddenly reckoning with an alien invasion. An intense, often scary adventure kicks off from there.

        <updated>2022-11-14T13:12:14.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The end of Fortnite Chapter 3 is upon us as Epic Games has revealed that its finale event will take place next month. 
More specifically, the finale event will take place on December 3 at 1 p.m. PT/4 p.m. ET. This news was revealed through a title card teased at the end of the Fortnite Champion Series, which took place over the weekend, as reported by Eurogamer. You can see the title card at the top of this story, if you're curious. 
Unfortunately, that's all that Epic Games teased in terms of the end of Fortnite's Fracture era. As for what's in store for Chapter 4 or what this finale event might play like, that remains unknown. Fortunately, we don't have to wait too much longer, though, because the event begins in just a few weeks. 
If it's anything like previous Fortnite chapter finales, then expect huge PvE battles across the island, plenty of spectacle, an exciting conclusion, and of course, some downtime as the game prepares to launch the next chapter.

Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. You can also catch up on previous episodes by visiting our new Game Informer Shows YouTube channel or watching the embedded episode below. 
Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. 


Join me, Marcus Stewart, and Blake Hester as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure. If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes. You’ll also be granted entry to the official Game Informer Discord channel, where our welcoming community members, moderators, and staff gather to talk games, entertainment, food, and organize hangouts!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remedy Entertainment has announced a new deal with publisher 505 Games to co-develop and market Control 2. The news also provided insight into the sequel's development status. 
According to a press release, Control 2 (once known as Codename Heron) is currently in the concept phase, being built in Remedy’s proprietary Northlight engine. The game will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Remedy will publish the PC version while 505 will handle the game’s console releases. Control 2 has no release window, but Remedy did release a piece of concept art, posted below. 
The press release also states that Control 2’s development budget initially sat at 50 million euros. Remedy and 505 will equally split marketing and development costs, as well as revenue generated by its release. Remedy retains full ownership of the Control IP, however. The press release also reveals that the first Control has sold over 3 million copies since launching in 2019. 
“We are excited to deepen our cooperation with Remedy and continue the success story of Control together,” say Rami and Raffi Galante, co-CEOs of Digital Bros Group/505 Games. “... Control is the biggest investment 505 Games has ever made, so it has a special place in our hearts. We are grateful to the whole player community that has made Control such a long-lasting and loved game, and are even more excited to bring out Control 2.”
This announcement was first teased last June, when Remedy and 505 revealed plans for new triple-A Control experiences. That same update revealed an upcoming multiplayer spin-off title known as Project Condor. Earlier this year, Remedy also struck a deal with Rockstar to develop remakes of Max Payne 1 and 2.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon Age: Absolution is coming to Netflix on December 9. A new trailer provides a deeper look into the adult animated series' premise and new heroes. 
The story centers on Miriam, an elven mercenary and former slave tasked with stealing a powerful and dangerous artifact. When the heist goes awry, the situation escalates into a larger fight for survival for Miriam and her friends. Set in Tevinter, the show features an original cast of heroes and, potentially, some old favorites (the characters at 0:45 look a lot like Cassandra and Leliana). Check out the trailer below. 


First announced during Netflix Geeked Week in June, Dragon Age: Absolution’s cast includes Kimberly Brooks (Miriam), Matthew Mercer (Fairbanks), Ashly Burch (Qwydion), Phil Lamarr (Roland), and Josh Keaton (Rezaren). The series consists of six 30-minute episodes. 
Though steeped in Dragon Age lore, it remains to be seen if the show has any connection to the upcoming Dragon Age: Dreadwolf. Absolution is far from the only video game adaptation Netflix has in the works. The CG-animated Sonic Prime also premieres in December. The streaming giant also announced a live-action Gears of War movie and its own animated series.]]></summary>

Beyond our coverage of Street Fighter 6 in the latest issue of Game Informer, issue 351 also includes a deep dive into Tchia, and the unusual trip where we learned more about the game.  
Tchia is created by the development studio known as Awaceb. Awaceb’s founders grew up in a small French territory east of Australia called New Caledonia, and this debut game from the studio is inspired by their childhood there. I visited New Caledonia in September, and joined the team from Awaceb to learn more about the culture, peoples, and geography that make it such a memorable place.  
Check out the new issue to discover more about the trip and the game.
Our video below features a small part of the lovely Tchia soundtrack alongside glimpses of video taken during the trip, as well as gameplay footage of Tchia.  


Tchia is set to release in early 2023 on PS5, PS4, and PC.

While we were in the city, Game Informer video editor Alex Van Aken and I thought it would be a great idea to take advantage of our proximity to Universal Studios Japan to visit Super Nintendo World. Like you, we saw the tour provided by the legendary Shigeru Miyamoto, but we needed to see it for ourselves. And to be quite frank, we are so glad that we did.
It's impossible to fully convey how cool most of our time at Super Nintendo World was. From the moment we exited the giant warp pipe at the entrance, we felt transported into an actual Mario game. Check out the photos from our time at Super Nintendo World to get a sense of how incredible the experience is.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Stadia’s impending shutdown in January, Google has begun fulfilling its promise of issuing refunds to its customers. The process started yesterday, and Google has posted an FAQ breaking down how it works. 
As previously announced, Google is refunding all software purchases through the Stadia Store (such as games, DLC, in-game currency, and current pre-orders) and hardware purchases made through the Google Store; physical store purchases cannot be refunded. Eligible hardware includes:
Stadia Controller
Founder's Edition
Premiere Edition
Play and Watch with Google TV packages
Stadia Pro subscriptions will not be refunded, but members can play their Pro titles until the shutdown. However, those who purchased a subscription on or after September 29, 2022, and were charged for it will have that money returned. 
Refunds will be issued to the form of payment used to make the purchase. If that account is no longer available, Google will send an email with instructions for setting up an alternative method of receiving the refund.
Users may have already received an email notifying them of their refund status. Although payments are now being issued, that doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll get yours today or this week. This will be a gradual rollout that will continue up until January 18. There's no way of knowing when you'll receive your refund, so eligible users should keep an eye on their inbox and bank account over the coming days or weeks.]]></summary>

Ken Masters, one of the two original playable Street Fighter characters, steps back into the spotlight with an all-new backstory.

We spoke with Williams about why God of War 2018's director, Cory Barlog, had to convince him to take on the role, why nearly every God of War game has a new director, how he discovered he is not able to generate visuals in his mind's eye, how the surprising casting of Richard Schiff as Odin came about, and plenty more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Escapism increases with yet another ScummVM release!
The ScummVM Team is thrilled to announce the immediate availability of ScummVM 2.6.1.
ScummVM 2.6.1 is a maintenance release mainly focused on improving the new features and engines we introduced in our previous release.
This update includes upgrades for the following engines:
AGS
AGOS
Asylum
Ultima
SCI
SCUMM
Tinsel
Toltecs
Toon
Other improvements include upgrading the icon-based grid view in the ScummVM launcher and fixing OpenGL render graphic corruptions.
Finally, Android users will be able to properly use a mouse on virtual screens, and Windows users will not have any duplicated icons folder issues.
You can find all of this goodness available for a number of platforms on our downloads page. If you are using Windows, macOS, the Ubuntu Snap package or the FlatHub repository, the auto-update robots will assist you in updating to ScummVM 2.6.1.
As always, the detailed list of improvements is available here.
Thank you for your continuous support — happy adventuring!

Luckily, I can offer you the first testing release of the 13.X release series. We collected whatever we could find on the cutting room floor to get you a Halloween release. Some of the higlights of this release include: Build NewGRF objects over an era with click-and-drag. Wider rivers on map generation. Improved handling of HiDPI and mixed-DPI screens. Some more GUI improvements like a cleaned up finance window. Many bug-fixes (over 50 of them), tweaks, changes, and other additions. (As ever, see the changelog for further details). The usual titlegame competition has been announced on the forums. See the page for the exact competition rules if you are interested. Download Changelog Bug tracker]]></summary>
