        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The BEUC, an umbrella group for 44 independent consumer organizations from 31 countries, and 22 member organizations, submitted a complaint to EU authorities on September 12, 2024, regarding "video games’ manipulative spending tactics." The group believes that many games that use premium currencies breach EU consumer protection laws. 


The group shared news of the complaint this week. After conducting its own analysis, it has found that games such as Fortnite, Minecraft, Clash of Clans, and EA Sports FC 24 all breach EU consumer protection laws through unfair practices. It's calling on the relevant authorities to investigate and crack down on these practices to ensure a safe environment for everyone who plays these games. Many of whom studies show are children without the financial litera…]]></summary>

Just take the board with nails out of the door and politely ask the occupant to leave. This is when enemies start showing up, by the way. You reach this room after you descend from the third floor to the second in the apartment complex. There is not only a monster, but also a dead woman and a few other things in the apartment to look at.


Most importantly, there’s a safe with a keypad; an always tantalizing feature in home decorating. The keypad requests a four-digit code. I’ll give you that code, but first I’ll just give you hints to help figure it out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The standard way to play Hollowbody is with its fixed-camera system that sometimes swaps to follow behind Mica’s back. It’s a throwback to the PS2 days of survival horror, and it’s effective. However, there is a first-person mode (or Dungeon Crawl mode, as the game calls it) if you want another perspective. And this is how you unlock it.


To unlock first-person mode, you first need to complete the game. It doesn’t really matter what difficulty you do it on.


As far as I know, there is no way to unlock first-person mode early. There may be a way to modify the files or a cheat code to input, but I’m writing this before the game’s actual release, so I don’t know of either of those. If one of these things are revealed by the developer or discovered by the community, I will update this article.

How to turn on first-person mode in Hollowbody


It’s really not immediately obvious how you actually access first-person mode in Hollowbody. It isn’t a menu setting, nor does it give you the option when starting New Game+. In fact, when you start New Game+, you can’t even access the option. You need to play the introduction with Sasha in the usual perspective.


You can activate first-person mode by opening your inventory. During a New Game+, you’ll have access to a couple of the cheat items: one for Big Head Mode, and the other for First-Person. By using the item, you’ll then change perspective.


Hollowbody is actually pretty fun in first-person. You can take a better look at the environment, though it loses some of its cinematic appeal. Certain actions (such as climbing) will take you out of the perspective. If you watch closely (at least in the pre-release build I played), Mica’s head will disappear right before it switches you into first-person. Good stuff. Otherwise, it works pretty well.

The PS2 was the best platform for horror. It was the last platform where a girl could feel safe to avoid monsters while dressed in her finest, shortest skirt. Dudes could search for their missing wives in the outfit she picked out for them. Combat barely functioned in most instances. Hollowbody longs for those days, as do I.

Development studio Odyssey Interactive has announced that it is working on a prototype combining Smash Bros-style platform fighting with 40-player battle royale gameplay. What's more, it is releasing this prototype to the public (thanks, Eurogamer).
Byte Breakers, as the dev is currently calling it, initially looks a lot like Smash when it first appears in the above reveal trailer. But, as the screen gets bigger, you'll see that this is a fair amount larger than anything we've seen in Nintendo's beloved fighting series to date. Forget a brawl, this is an all-out battle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Boosters have undergone a change in eFootball 2025, and they have been empowered even more in the current version.


In Dream Team, you can now get cards with not one but two boosters. Moreover, you can choose between the type of boosters you want. You can opt for random boosters and try your luck. You can also invest more resources to select the booster you want on a given card. Let's take a look at how you can apply them to cards and how you can gain the resources required to craft them in the first place.


eFootball 2025 boosters guide


In case you're new to the game, boosters aren't new. They have been there for a long time, and the epic icons released over the last year can get a booster applied to them. There are also unique cards for active footballers who can take advantage of stat boosts during a game.

Earlier, you could only apply one booster to a card from 'player actions.' Now, some cards will have one booster already applied to them. You'll be able to read its effects by going into the details. Now, you can have two different ways to proceed with the second slot:



Apply a specific booster - You'll need 100 Select Booster Tokens. Once you have enough of them, you'll be able to select your choice from a wide type of boosts.


Apply a random booster - You'll need 1 Booster Token. You can overwrite your selection later if you're unhappy with your choice.



How to get Select Booster tokens in eFootball 2025


Image via Destructoid


You'll need a lot of Select Booster tokens, and they're expected to be available in multiple ways. One of the best methods currently available is to release the Showtime cards you might have in your squads. Doing so will give you eight Select Booster tokens for every released card. Konami will likely likely release more objectives down the road to help players gain these tokens.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Layoffs continue at Microsoft as the company has cut another 650 jobs today, according to an internal memo from Head of Xbox Phil Spencer that was acquired by The Verge. Not even eight months ago Microsoft laid off 1,900 employees from Activision Blizzard and Xbox, bringing the total number of jobs lost across Microsoft's Gaming Division to over 2,500 in 2024 alone.


According to Spencer, the cuts are part of "aligning our post-acquisition team structure and managing our business", with the post-acquisition referring to the $68.7 billion deal to purchase Activision Blizzard that was completed late last year. Spencer also went on to point out that "no games, devices, or experiences are being canceled" as part of today's round of layoffs, and no studios are being closed.

Last week, Team Asobi and Sony released the adorable 3D platformer Astro Bot (you might have heard of it) and in the time since, the game appears to have taken over the minds and hearts of everyone lucky enough to lock eyes on it.
Very good, but not all that Nintendo-relevant, right? Well, as we noted earlier this week, fans were quick to point out just how much Astro's latest adventure borrows from the Big N's back catalogue, with Super Mario Sunshine, Galaxy, Pikmin and Splatoon as a handful of the games to which it's 'inspiration' has been compared. In short, there's a lot of Nintendo in this non-tendo title.

I've never been able to perform it consistently. It's one of many moderately fiddly special attacks - written down for posterity in a tear-stained journal I keep sorrowfully beneath my pillow - which have walled me out of enjoying fighting games, much as I love thinking about them. 


That wall grows ever higher as I age and my digits turn to dust and my dreams of launching Ryu like a sack of potatoes fade into the twilight. Still, at least I can still play and have fun with shooters, right? All you have to do in shooters is press a button once to make stuff go boom. Wait, Nightmare Operator, what are you doing?

Since its launch on 6th September 2024, PS5's Astro Bot has been making waves in the gaming community thanks to its high quality and ingenuity. By taking heavy inspiration from Nintendo (and specifically the Super Mario franchise), developer Team Asobi has undoubtedly crafted one of the finest platformers in recent memory.
One individual who has been spending time with the game is none other than Masahiro Sakurai, the legendary creator behind the Kirby and Super Smash Bros. franchises. In an effort to plug his latest YouTube video on game runtimes, he posted a tweet to state that he has completed Astro Bot and rescued all 300 of the lost bots. He says that while this didn't take a great deal of time, he found the game interesting enough that he simply couldn't help but play it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Better check those desert dunes again Caravan SandWitch, someone’s buried the lede. An open world you can explore in a few relaxed evenings? One that favours the joyous freeform sightseeing of an Elden Ring or Breath Of The Wild; where you’ll scramble up vast industrial concrete ruins on scavenging missions for inquisitive frogs, instead of being nagged by bothersome checklists?
Ok, rain check on that last point. SandWitch can’t help but eventually funnel the freedom of ambling around in your chuffy yellow van into restrictive collect-a-thons. Still, for much of its breezy runtime, this one’s a real panacea for gaming’s more bloated map-scourers. Plus, even when you are sent off to hamster-cheek scavenged components before making progress, there’s very little in this world that doesn’t feel intentional. Sidequests and storytelling crumbs are deliberately scattered throughout, and each building is a thoughtful concrete puzzle box. It is, in brief, a nice time.
You play as Sauge, a spacefarer returned to her planet of Cigalo after receiving a distress signal from her missing sister. Cigalo’s a cheery place, though economically and environmentally devastated after being exploited by an evil spacecorp named The Consortium. It’s populated by small settlements of people, some large talking frogs named the Reinetos, and the occasional friendly robot. Everything’s friendly, as it goes - even gravity itself. There’s no danger, no death, no damage from flinging yourself off the tallest building you can find. Just helping out your desert buds, upgrading your van with more gadgets to solve puzzles, or working on finding exactly where Sauge’s sister has go to.

I suppose it would take an unnecessary amount of setup to lampshade that my dexterity brawler, Mischief, actually switches out her regular poison for bone-hurting juice when fighting skeletal undead. So, you get a pass for now, game. Here’s a trailer:

This means that, yes, when you all sit down together in the evening, you can enjoy a hearty family meal in the knowledge that between you, you technically own six copies of the Cities Skylines Big Butt Skinner Balloon.
Each person on the account will have one of two roles: adult or child. Adults can manage parental controls, set hourly or daily playtime limits, approve purchase requests, and control store access. Valve appear very proud of making it easier for parents to spend money, streamlining the “time-consuming” task of buying games for their kids.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are cold opens and there are freezing ones. Sci-fi roguelike shooter Wild Bastards doesn't start on its strongest cowboy boot. You are dumped into the middle of an interstellar chase and summarily shown the ropes. The guns feel simplistic, the arenas bare, the loot vanilla, and the entire loop of beaming down to a planet and getting into small-scale "showdowns" threatens to become stale within the first hour or so. But then you find an outlaw buddy who offers a new way to shoot human dirtbags. Then another fellow bandit. And another. By the time your spaceship is half-filled with scoundrels and weirdoes shouting at each other, the game has warmed up enough to reveal its central idea. This ain't no grand FPS campaign, nor is it quick as roguelikes go. It's a snacky shootout sim with tumbleweed towns that feels best when you savour the pre-fight suspense.

1. Call of Duty (2003)

After making the incredible Medal Of Honor: Allied Assault, some devs at 2015, Inc. decided that they wanted more, and so went on to form Infinity Ward and give us the original Call Of Duty. The result was an even more faithful and grittier redo of some of WWII's most important battles. It became a critical and sales success, naturally spawning Activision's most famous franchise.

The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is just weeks out from launching on the Switch and Nintendo isn't holding back with its marketing campaign. Apart from some lifestyle ads here in the West, in Japan it's also releasing some new commercials.
The latest ones give fans a closer look at Zelda and how she'll be able to utilise the Tri Rod in-game - summoning all sorts of items to deal with enemy threats. It is only a brief look but there's still a lot to see. There's also a reminder in there that the Hyrule Edition Switch Lite will arrive on the same day.

For instance, when you begin your MyCareer save, you usually pick a team where you have the best chance of becoming a starter. When things didn't go according to plan, a trade was beneficial. This year, however, the same privilege isn't available as of writing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disney Lorcana's sixth major set is called Azurite Sea. It brings characters from Big Hero Six and just about everybody from Rescue Rangers to the TCG in a fresh new setting: The Azurite Sea. Characters take to the seafaring setting with brilliant abilities to build a new deck around. 


The Disney Lorcana Azurite Sea set was revealed during September 2024's Lorecast livestream. It's one that's been in the works since the game's creation and brings some very exciting cards to the game. As you'd expect, the set can be used to build upon decks from every previous set, but you could also build a brand new one from cards you pick up specifically from Azurite Sea and still potentially beat your opponents without too many issues.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’ve been hoping to take The Plucky Squire on the road, or in places where your PC can’t quite go, then you’re in luck — All Possible Futures has revealed that the game has obtained Steam Deck Verification in time for digital release on September 17. 


This is amazing news for anyone with a Steam Deck, as the in-and-out-of-the-storybook adventure can now be played both in and out of the house, and there’s nothing stopping you from taking the cutesy cartoon world wherever you’re going. 




Back in December 2023, Devolver Digital cheekily noted on Twitter they were playing on Steam Deck, so the verified status should come as no surprise to future players. However, it has been a fair while (9 months, but who’s counting?) since then, and I for one was beginning to worry that verification wouldn’t come until after the digital release. 


The Plucky Squire doesn’t appear on the Steam Deck website's list of officially verified games just yet, but just knowing that it should soon be there is more than enough to keep me happy.


If you’re a Steam Deck owner twiddling your thumbs as you wait for release, The Plucky Squire will be joining a long list of other epic games that are verified, including Fields of Mistria, No Man’s Sky, and Baldur’s Gate 3, so there’s plenty to keep you occupied while you wait.

First, we’ll break down the weapons you should use for this build. Do not worry if you haven’t gotten to the later tiers of weapons yet. The base weapons themselves with earlier upgrades will do fine, but you should work your way towards the Relic tier.

Hieroglitch Pyramid in Camo Cosmos is one such level, and it hides a Lost Galaxy exit so well, that you'd think you missed it. 


Hieroglitch Pyramid is one of the tougher levels in Astro Bot. It challenges you to survive an ancient Egyptian-inspired labyrinth filled with enemies and deadly traps. You're given the metal ball ability partway through the level. You'll need it to not only make it to the end but to find the Lost Galaxy exit once you get there.

In order to actually deal damage to the God Statue and therefore kill it, you first need to kill four statues around the outskirts of the Double Dungeon Disaster stage that come to life once the final stage starts and the God Statue spawns.

If you haven't read Leviathan and its two sequels, let me give you a quick sum-up. It's 1914, and the flames of World War I have just started burning across Europe. This isn't our great-great grandparents' World War I, though; in Westerfield's reimagined 20th-century Earth, the forces of the Allied and Central powers wage war against each other with bio-engineered beasts and diesel-fueled automatons.

Some even reward you for specific actions, including dancing, punching, and capturing photos. In this guide, we'll focus on one achievement by showing you how to unlock the Astro Bot Let's Twist Again trophy.


How to unlock Astro Bot Let's Twist Again trophy


Based on the trophy hint, you'll need to find an "iconic marsupial" at the Crash Site. This mysterious character is none other than Crash Bandicoot, who can be unlocked relatively early in the saga. Go up to Crash Bandicoot and dance with him by pressing down on the D-Pad, earning you the Let's Twist Again trophy in Astro Bot.

If you still need to acquire the character, travel to Gorilla Nebula and enter the Az-Tech Trail. Progress through the course until you see a stack of fruit crates. Hit it to place Crash Bandicoot in your collection.

You may also need his Spinning Marsupial animation, purchasable from the Gatcha Lab for 100 coins. Now, locate Crash Bandicoot, who will be to the right of the Crash Site's desert region, and start dancing. You can commemorate the occasion, too, with a photo by pressing down on the D-Pad.


In addition to the trophy, you can punch the marsupial to uncover another distinct animation. You'll also discover plenty more unlockable trophies nearby, including going to the top of the Mothership for the At the Top of My Game achievement or dancing with 100 bots in Bot Bot Revolution.

This gooey, melt-in-the-middle dessert is a 3-star, level 20 recipe made in tier two Kitchens.

Back in 2021, Black Tabby Games — an indie studio formed by husband-and-wife team Tony Howard-Arias and Abby Howard — released the first episode of the episodic visual novel Scarlet Hollow on Steam. Visually striking with ink drawings and a deep branching narrative, the duo put the studio on the map from episode one, and fans have been lapping it up since.
But one episodic release just wasn't enough, and in 2023, the team launched Slay the Princess, a visual novel that asks you to do what the game says on the tin: slay the princess. It's an expectations-subverting masterclass that received rave reviews upon its release on Steam. A year later, Tony and Abby are back with an expanded version of the game that's coming to all consoles — Slay The Princess - The Pristine Cut.

Following a hugely successful launch on Steam back in 2020, indie developer Spiderling Studios has brought the physics-based medieval vehicle-builder Besiege to Switch. What's more, it's available right now.
This is a game that will see you building deadly devices to take on whichever army is unlucky enough to stand in your way. What you build is entirely your call, with over 70 different blocks at your disposal and enough inspiration out there to keep you going for a while (just take a look at the above trailer).

Nic, I have no interesting ways to describe mushrooms right now. I used up all the mushroom lore I've ever gleaned from real-life foraging when I wrote about Morels 2, and I spent most of that article whining about unicorns. The best I can do as regards Shroom And Gloom is to say that these Shrooms do indeed look very Gloomy, possibly because some mad human has wandered into their warren and is now stabbing and eating them.

A new overview trailer has been released for developer Sam Enright's upcoming RPG Beyond Galaxyland, and it's looking quite lovely, if we do say so ourselves.
Clocking in at over five minutes in length, the trailer goes through what you can expect from the game's bonkers story, how you can catch creatures and even bosses to summon during combat, and provides an overview of some of the outrageous side-quests you'll be encountering on your journey.

It boldly describes itself as a "Cult-of-the-Lamb-lite, Rimworld-lite, Majesty-like mixed with Black & White with a pinch of Against the Storm". Whoa there, pardner, save a few subgenres for the rest of us! I think that's half the New & Trending keywords on Steam in one sentence. If you're mystified, best watch the announcement trailer - it paints a clearer picture, though it does involve a startling amount of cartoon decapitation and dismemberment.

        <updated>2024-09-11T15:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Old dog, new tricks.
A couple years ago, a small studio called Medallion Games released a cute platformer called Grapple Dog, which as you could probably guess, is a platformer about a dog with a grappling hook. The simple premise played host to an impressively well-made and enjoyable adventure that felt like a meaningful homage to — and evolution of — classic platformer game design, although it never quite captured the audience that it deserved. Clearly sales were sufficient to justify a sequel, however, and Medallion Games has now graced us with Grapple Dogs: Cosmic Canines. This sophomore outing for Pablo and friends proves to be an even stronger game than the first one, and we’d highly suggest you give it a look if you’re a fan of 2D platformers.
Grapple Dogs picks up almost immediately where its predecessor left off, which teased that Pablo’s adventure wasn’t quite over with his defeat of the robot, Nul. It turns out that Nul’s antics inadvertently released an evil godlike being named Vyr, which threatens to destroy the entire multiverse if the four pieces of the shattered Allkrystal aren't collected. Pablo isn’t the only hero whose universe has a stake in this brewing conflict, however, and he's soon joined on his quest by another grapple dog named Luna—a no-nonsense, gun-wielding pup who doesn’t have time to play nice. Together, the two set out to track down the pieces of the Allkrystal and hopefully find a way to defeat Vyr before all is lost.

Like most Sonic fans, we here at Nintendo Life love the GBA's 'Advance' Series. We have fond memories of playing through the Advance trilogy (and even the tangentially related fighting RPG and pinball spinoffs) in the early 2000s, but bar the SonicN N-Gage port and a Virtual Console release in Japan, we haven't had the chance to play them on any new hardware since.
With the fan adoration for these games, a remake or remaster feels like a no-brainer, no? Well, in a recent interview with VGC, Sonic Team head Takashi Iizuka confessed that he would be very much up for it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[$699 is the new $599.
Recently, we asked you if $499 would be too much to pay for a 'Switch 2'. 20% of respondees said 'nope', nearly 30% thought it would be too much, and the majority (rather sensibly) said that it would depend on how big of an upgrade Nintendo's next generation of hardware represented.
Yesterday Sony pulled back the curtain on the long-rumoured PS5 Pro, an iterative update to its existing console which offers a spec-bump that, as Mark Cerny said in his presentation, looks to close the gap between performance and fidelity modes. Showcasing a modest but noticeable boost (at least when zooming in on the pixels as the presentation did) to several games in Sony's back catalogue — including Marvel's Spider-Man 2 (2023), Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart (2021), and The Last of Us II Remastered (2024) — the price was then revealed: $699 / £699 / €799.

That’s a lot of cheddar for a living room games box, and while us Windows lot can’t quite claim pointing and laughing privileges – speccing a 4K-capable, DIY build desktop for seven hundred quid is certainly beyond me – the fact is that if you can get some pretty nifty PC kit for less. While still, let’s not forget, being able to play most of the PS5’s best games. It would not surprise me if someone from Sony’s PC division is already trying to entice Astro Bot underneath a cardboard box held up by a stick.

This might seem unreasonable if you're not into modding, but the price of updating a game is often that you break any mods designed for it. Hence, the parts of Minecraft's history many seasoned Minecraft modders - together with server owners and pro mapmakers - remember most fondly are the longer lulls between updates.

Nintendo has revealed a special manhole cover which will be housed in Kyoto's Nintendo Museum and it's quite the looker (thanks, GoNintendo). Nope, we never thought we'd be saying that about a manhole cover either, but here we are.

Private Division and Wētā Workshop have announced that Tales of the Shire: A Lord of the Rings Game will be getting its own showcase as part of the upcoming 'Hobbit Day' celebrations on 22nd September 2024.
In case you're unaware, Hobbit Day is pretty well known within the Tolkien community and represents the respective birthdays of Bilbo and Frodo Baggins (the former of which, at 111, hasn't aged a day, don't you know). Generally, some fans like to emulate the celebrations held for Bilbo during the 'A Long-Expected Party' chapter of Tolkien's book, while others simply opt to spend the day with bare feet. It also presents an opportunity for libraries to shed a light on Tolkien's work and get more folks reading - always a good thing, if you ask us.

Given that The Crew is an online-only game, that signalled its death knell… or death horn, more accurately. Then in April, they tow-trucked the game out of people's libraries and revoked their purchases. This led to a backlash, as you'd expect, and Ubisoft are accordingly taking a different approach with The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest. They're giving both an offline mode to "ensure long term access to both titles".

There was a time when the yearly NBA 2K Switch entry was something to look forward to. Each year was a step back from the next-gen counterpart, of course, but the Nintendo port offered a near-full-fat experience with the added bonus of portability. Those were the days, eh?

Whenever I visit family in the States and find myself in a derelict shopping plaza or some other place affected by America's depressing sense of architectural planning and overreliance on cars, I can't help but feel a sense of dread.

I like to walk in the woods around evening time, after a hard day of writing stupid listicles about Call Of Duty. Forests are a critical preoccupation of mine, actually - check this lumpen thinkypiece I wrote about Alan Wake 2 - but they're also spaces for retreat and reflection, where I can shrug off the angst and lose myself in the spectacle of sycamores and silverbirch, arching over the path.

That process begins with the speedy release of several fan reworkings of the trailer that use something like vanilla Minecraft graphics, rather than the original, unholy fusion of LB Photo Realism and Jack Black. This'll teach Johnny Hollywood to run his grubby hands all over our beloved Creepers, eh.

A modder has cracked open some previously disabled abilities in the official modding toolkit for Baldur's Gate 3, making it possible for folks to create their own levels or alter the game's existing environments. The toolkit (which was only made available last week) previously wouldn't let you do any of that, due to "technical constraints and platform-specific guidelines," according to developers Larian. But modders neither care nor sleep. It took them just two days to worm their way into the devkit's innards and make the impossible possible.

The Maw is ascendant during the darker months, its constellations growing visible to the naked eye. We will need a steady dosage of new PC games to keep it quiescent. Fortunately, this week is looking quite bountiful.

It features ship travel, combat, trade, and base building, and you can do all of it alone or with space mates. It’s got a demo, but it’s also on the cheaper end if you fancy buying into early access. Considering the pricing, I’d say it’s a real looker, too.

Overhauls to enemies are on the way, less-loved guns will be more effective, reworks to armor penetration and health values are on the boil, and they're taking inspiration from "player fantasies" for certain weapons and stratagems. All of these tweaks are set to go live on the 17th September, so not long to wait.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Gearbox developers working on Risk Of Rain 2 have released a patch for its poorly received expansion, Seekers Of The Storm. The recent DLC for the action roguelike came out of the oven a little doughy, with enough game-breaking bugs to thoroughly upset some fans. Including one bug that sometimes made the game's final boss accidentally invincible. Ah. Yesterday's patch seems to target the worst of these bugs, and the dev team promise there are more fixes are to come.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[About 12 years ago, we drew our breath in pain to report that Lone Survivor developer Jasper Byrne's new "Zelda x Demon's Souls" action-RPG was no more. "It was too big for a single person to make," Byrne wrote at the time. "This is the root of the problem. It wasn't that I fell out of love with the idea, just that I can't physically do it." That was then and this, thankfully, is now. Byrne has tentatively returned to the project and begun sharing screens on social media.

The suspect has been charged with copyright infringement. While posting small clips from movies or TV-shows typically doesn't result in criminal action, taking nude clips out of context is considered a breach of actors' and filmmakers' integrity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Black & White was a god game that frustrated more often than it delighted, but which was nevertheless delivered with enough verve and ambition to be worth playing. It's a crying shame that it's not currently available to buy anywhere digitally, presumably because the rights are soaked in a gutter between EA (the original publisher) and Microsoft (who bought and closed developers Lionhead).

If you do still own a physical copy of Black & White however, you might be interested in Openblack. It's a fan-led project to create a modern, open source engine for running Black & White, and its first build was just released yesterday.

"Creature" is perhaps too narrow a word - the game's "playable characters" range from geese, microscopic life and triceratops to menhirs and small rocky islands. Each forms the heart of a diamond of delicately drawn, isometric grid terrain with a baby mobile canopy of clouds and sun. It looks like an illustration from an old botanical or geographical textbook, although the inviting emptiness around the visible area also dimly reminds  me of certain elder RPGs I used to play on Macintosh.

I grab the faulty power transformer without listening, and am immediately electrocuted. Worse still, I have to hammer a quick-time button to recover.

Jerry is being tasked with repair work beyond his job description, learning the ins and outs of an escape pod's machinery from his co-worker via radio. This may come in handy, as the station is about to explode. Tin Can is not a new game (it came out in 2022) but it is on sale as part of Steam's space exploration fest.

Graham always has his hands on the video game pulse, gliding them over Xwitter or Steam or wherever and waiting for that "ker kun, ker kun" of a new Cool Thing. And that cool thing is Bakeru, described by its Steam page as "Japan-esque", but is in actual fact, very Japanese. I mean, you travel around 47 Japanese prefectures as a metamorphing tanuki who bashes evilness with his taiko drum sticks. Come on.
What I hadn't suspected was Bakeru's chops not only as a platformer, but as a means to increase your chances at success in pub quizzes. The game is a certified trivia Tardis, where you'll learn all sorts about Japanese culture as well as just like, the colour sepia being a genus of cuttlefish.

They're claiming (via in-game broadcast) that the fleeting appearance of a weird purple blob on the map screen is actually the result of fluids leaking from the corpse of a long-dead comms technician, stranded on a server farm somewhere. Who to believe? Ah, if only we had some means of shedding light on the reports. Some way of Illuminating the situation.

The court upheld a lower court's decision, stating that IA's practice of scanning and lending copyrighted books without permission is not fair use.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bear with me on this, but I adore how swordfighting works in Dune. Ubiquitous wearable sci-fi shields repel any attack that comes in too fast, so everyone has to learn this unique, overtly dance-like form of close-quarters combat where every thrust and parry is necessarily slow and considered. Picture it: careful judgments of your movements, weighing up the right time to strike, every measured jab part of a wider strategy that culminates in the kill.
MOBAs are like that. Both in the fights themselves, sort of, where probing lunges lead up to bursts of lethality, but more broadly in each match as a whole. They’re map-wide knife fights, where a thrust is a well-judged lane push and a parry a savvy item buy. At first, playing Smite 2 felt akin to watching on helplessly as my opponents repeatedly shoved their crysknives through my ribs. After 30 hours, it often still feels like that - but I am enjoying myself. Mostly. Despite Valve’s third-person elephant in the lane.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nikhil Murthy's Syphilisation is a "postcolonial 4X game", which might sound like a contradiction in terms. While approaches to 4X and grand strategy vary hugely between games, factions and players, the genre as a whole is firmly wedded to imperial conquest, both structurally and at the level of narrative aspects and set-dressing. Many 4X games are triumphal re-enactments of specific periods of colonial settlement and expansion. All of which is to say that Syphilisation is fascinating. It's a reworking of the genre which dismantles and reconstructs concepts such as diplomacy, research and production. It's also just left early access - find more details and a playthrough video below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been 13 years since the first Space Marine came out. While it wasn't outstanding in the grander landscape of gaming, enough Warhammer 40K fans seem to have cherished the escapades of bulky blue boltgunner Demetrian Titus for the action game to merit a sequel a decade later. It left its story on something of a cliffhanger, with said hero being dragged away to face untold tortures by the Inquisition, the most zealous sect of this preternaturally paranoid sci-fi universe. Today, Titus is free again. Free to stomp towards hordes of alien foes, blast them with a plasma incinerator, and shred the stragglers with a chainsaw sword. Space Marine 2 is an often-satisfying scrapper that has me  convinced of 40K's merit as a crafting ground for excellent-looking environments and creatures, even if I'm not particularly moved by the bland character of Titus and his fellow Ultramarines.

Now, developers Lemaitre Bros are making a gott-dang 1v1 FPS called Straftat, slated for release on 24th October 2024 with over 100 arenas. It's similarly in love with concrete, but it also has blunderbusses, dual-wielding, Gatling guns, corner-peeking, curved swords, cowboy hats and beehive hairdos.

"From delivering a giant flailing Marlin, to the disposal of an atomic bomb teetering on the edge of explosion," say the developers, "always expect the unexpected." It's maybe best understood by witnessing the moment in the trailer below where the player drifts right through a menswear store, bringing the whole building down. Yep, that looks like a good time.

I, a terrestrial chump, cannot help be taken in by it all. But I get the sense all this spacey wonder is just so much unremarkable grease pooling at the rim of a diner plate for my Star Trucker. He’s seen a couple things, that’s for sure. Taken the long way round the spiral arm to slip past security checkpoints and offload cases of booze for off-the-record cash.

Parcel Corps is a light-hearted bicycle courier sim set in a colourful totalitarian regime where the police do not like things to be delivered in time, or at all. Perhaps that's why the game, which was due to arrive on Steam tomorrow, has been delayed until an unspecified date. That's okay, half the news stories we write seem to be about release setbacks.

To shreds, I say - it’s currently sitting at 79% ‘mostly negative’ rating on Steam. Among the chief complaints are…uh, everything, it looks like. The DLC is reportedly so bug-ridden that it’s taken many of the base game’s core systems down with it.
Gearbox - who acquired Risk Of Rain from Hopoo Games in 2022 - have since put out a blog with a list of known issues they’re targeting, and encourage players to keep submitting bug reports. Among the listed issues are a boss named Mithrix becoming invincible (“definitely not intentional”), and “an issue that allowed players to get stuck while smelling the flowers”.

Well, this'll make things easier: both games are currently free to keep as part of the Fallout Classic Collection over on the Epic Games Store.

Fallout Tactics is free, too, but I don't know whether Todd's cruel enough to want people to experience that one as it was.

Fortunately, I've spent my penance playing the demo for Witching Stone, which applies the magic of shape-matching to the magic of, well, magic. Out on 16th September, it's a pixelart charmer that "combines elements of puzzle games, roguelites and deckbuilders", much as you'd combine a red circle and two golden triangles to spark a lightning bolt.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the first post for my series on "saving" open world design, I complained that many of today's open worlds feel like checklists of formulaic tasks and rewards, their geography a vaporous staging ground for itemisable, cycling content-gathering opportunities, which flies in the face of the sense of freedom and wonder they're supposed to inspire. My interviewees, Elder Scrolls veterans Matt Firor and Nate Purkeypile, argued that this reflects the expense and scale of today's open world productions, which constrains experimental design both at a practical level and in terms of overall direction.
CD Projekt open world designer Jakub Tomczak doesn't, as far as I know, have an answer to the issue of production bloat, but he does have a disarmingly obvious solution to the 'checklist problem', based on his time creating missions for Cyberpunk 2077 and its Phantom Liberty expansion: get better at hiding the checklist. Weave it into the landscape and setting more artfully, with an elegant balance of randomisation and responsiveness to the player's behaviour which keeps everything fresh.

If you missed its announcement in May, The Forever Winter is a co-op extraction shooter set in a grim future where you struggle to survive amid an unending hyperindustrial war. Since that reveal developers Fun Dog Studios have mostly been sending out small "burst transmissions" - essentially footage from the hellfront - like this patriotic beheading and some panicked gunfights. But today they've made a longer video revealing an early access release date. And - oh! - it's quite soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I won an awful board game from Nickelodeon once. I say “won”. Actually, I got disconnected phoning into a competition line after I’d gotten through, got upset loudly, my mum called them to complain, they fast tracked me to the next competition thing, I got the quiz answer wrong, and the presenter pretended he’d heard the right answer and pulled a prize out of the big prize bucket. It was a copy of The Game of Life, possibly the least exciting board game a child can win.
The game was dog water, and there’s probably a lesson in there somewhere about how cool and good it is to whine until you get free things, but we don’t have time for that. Instead, I’d like to draw your attention to Floops Big House Adventure. It’s a grungy, slimy, Aaahh!!! Real Monsters meets Ren and Stimpy Saturday morning shooter. Some of you will already hate it from the header screenshot, I imagine. Personally, the art drew me right in.

It’ll set you back $25, £20 or €25, and my drive-by analysis of the trailer below is that they've done a decent job with the ports.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first time I encountered Jack King-Spooner's work, it was when he sent me a copy of Sluggish Morss: Pattern Circus over hospital wifi late at night. The game was a bright spot in a bad time, which might seem peculiar given that Sluggish Morss often looks like a whale's upset stomach, but it's such a feverishly inventive creation. It blew the dust from my synapses.
The same appears true of King-Spooner's upcoming Judero, on which he is collaborating with Soul Searching developer Talha Kaya. It casts you as a "pagan seer" armed with a big stick, who is searching the mythical Scottish borderlands for evil creatures to clobber. It looks cheerier and airier than Sluggish Morss, with a more overt emphasis on mechanics such as combat, but it has the same pickled 3am energy to it. It's also now got a release date - 16th September - and a new trailer below.

The only piles are the logs Sid’s crouched behind as he prepares to sneak up to a cable car guarded by Nazis. That is the only haemorrhoids allusion I will ever make on this website. Until the next time I have to write about Andrew Wilson.
“Oil just use my trusty knoife” mutters Sid as I take down my first guard. Straight away, the animation and noise indicators evoke the same Shadow Tactics or Desperados III goodness you’re probably expecting. Fine with me - that’s exactly what I’m here for. Mimimi’s closing was a real gutpunch, and while I don’t expect anyone to match their exceptional work any time soon, it’s at least reassuring to see Warsaw studio Artificer picking up the torch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unionised workers at Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 studio Raven Software have filed a complaint with the US National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) against parent companies Activision Blizzard and Microsoft, as reported by Game File (paywalled), and covered by Game Developer. The complaint, write Game Developer, is over “bad faith bargaining” and “concerted activities” - which covers "retaliation, discharge, [and] discipline."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in March, Bungie announced a leadership reshuffle on their Marathon reboot project, with former Valorant dev Joe Ziegler replacing veteran Bungie designer Christopher Barrett as director. It seems there was more to that story than concern about the progress of Marathon. According to a new Bloomberg report citing anonymous sources, Barrett was in fact fired this spring after he was accused by several female Bungie staff of inappropriate behaviour.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every now and then I reflect on the statistically determined average age of a Gamer – what is it now, 36, 37? Please let it still be under 40 – and realise with alarm that, by extrapolation, a lot of the people reading this probably have children. Augh, children! Please excuse me while I go stand on a chair, clutching a broom. I’ve never understood the craze for generating smaller versions of yourself. It’s one of those weirder subcultures you read about in the papers, but rarely observe in daily life. 


I do, however, understand the appeal of same-screen co-op games like Run From Mummies - which, being a bloodless comedy dungeon romp, seems like a fair pick for those encumbered with boisterous selfspawn. Don’t worry, the “mummies” of the title are just regular old disembowelled corpses wrapped in cloth, not those sinister, non-embalmed “mothers” you’ve been hearing about down the grocers.

When ten citizens dropped dead on the roads of one of my settlements in post-apocalyptic city builder Endzone 2, I had to work fast to avoid a sickness breaking out. But graveyards require a lot of space, and if you've already filled your shanty town with a sea of corrugated metal roofs, this poses a problem. Welcome to the pleasant headache of town planning in a post-nuclear world, where most of the land is brown and uninhabitable.
