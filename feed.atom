        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Heihachi Mishima, the mustachioed malevolence of the Tekken series, is going to be the next DLC character for Tekken 8. He was last seen with his loving son Kazuya, who threw him into a volcano. Of course, to be fully submerged in impossibly hot liquid rock is merely a long-running family prank for the cast of this 3D fighting game, sort of like forcing your granddad to do the ice bucket challenge, but with lava. Nobody truly expected the horn-haired headbutter to be fully removed from the series. But I am a little surprised to see him back so soon.

While obtaining pre-war nuclear launch codes was a privilege only a few in the world had, the post-apocalyptic wasteland hands out codes as if they were phone numbers. If you're looking to leave a radioactive scar upon Earth yourself, you're gonna need to know what Nuke Codes are currently active.


Currently active Fallout 76 Nuke Codes (July 15 - July 22):




Alpha: 
340 14 750




Bravo:

Charlie:

A recently discovered loot farming location in The First Descendant is capable of an unlimited output of loot. Called 'The Valby Run' by the community, the Strategic Outpost location within the Fortress can respawn enemy mobs infinitely. As a result, it's capable of offering item drops at around a 2-3 times higher rate than other locations, according to the developer.


Since this was completely unintentional and because we're so used to it with other loot-based games, everyone expected this to get patched out sooner than later. Instead, the Director, Minseok Joo has announced Patch 1.0.4. Instead of removing the incredibly high efficiency of loot within this mission, all other Strategic Outpost locations will now match the efficiency. 


The First Descendant Patch 1.0.4 notes


Although the developer originally stated no additional patch will be necessary next week, it will instead deploy a hotfix, titled Patch 1.0.4. It will do the following:



Reduce cooldown time for Vulgus Strategic Outpost


Rebalance locations for collecting Void Fragments


Update other farming locations to match efficiency equivalent to The Fortress Outpost



Far too often we see developers nerf everything fun and efficient into the ground to prevent players from progressing more quickly than intended. As a result, the rare buff-everything-else method the developers of The First Descendant are taking is much appreciated.

Still, even if you’re a stranger to the genre, you’re likely to have already watched “Official EVO moment #37" somewhere. That's the name of a clip from an early iteration of the tournament in which Daigo Umehara has an unbelievable comeback after seeing his HP reduced to a point that it becomes invisible. Yesterday, on the second day of Evo 2024, we witnessed what many fighting game experts are already heralding as Official Evo moment #38.


In short, long time pro and legend Hayao likely made the best use of Hugo in the history of Street Fighter to seal the win against FrankieBGF's Ken.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Out of all the new characters to be announced for Guilty Gear Strive at EVO 2024, I don’t think Lucy from Cyberpunk: Edgerunners was on anyone’s bingo card. 


In a now private video, Arc System Works revealed a new three-versus-three mode, new stages, and four new characters including fan favorites Dizzy and Venom as well as Unika from the upcoming Guilty Gear Strive anime. But most surprising of all is a guest character: Lucy.


We here at Destructoid love Edgerunners – it has a gripping story that expands the Cyberpunk world in whole new directions and just has some phenomenal characters. Lucy is an odd addition to the world of Guilty Gear, but in the grand scheme of things it isn’t all that weird.


Guilty Gear has similar themes and visuals to the world of Edgerunners, with bombastic over-the-top artwork and individualist ideas. Both Arc System Works and Studio Trigger are known for their flashy action, so I think Lucy will fit well into the roster.


We won’t see Lucy playable until 2025, so we’ll have to wait a while until we get to see her in action and how she fits.

Despite being one of its highest-grossing films, Iron Man 3 is one of the most divisive movies in the history of the MCU.

An interception is the act of blocking your opponent's pass from reaching the intended receiver. The motive is pretty apparent - stop the pass, and the resulting turnover could help to change your team's fortunes. While the process of intercepting the ball isn't rocket science, there are certain mechanics to master.


College Football 25 Interception guide


The controls in College Football 25 are pretty simple. As your opponent receiver tries to grab the ball, press the Y/Triangle button on your Xbox/PlayStation controller. This will make your defensive player try to catch the ball and attempt to reach it before the offensive receiver.

The new quest is called The Lotus Eaters and is a prologue to Warframe: 1999 that will set up the story for those who have already tackled everything Whispers in the Walls and Jade Shadows has to offer.

Nilou Bloom teams are very strong, but are they strong enough to be worth spending your Primogems? Here’s an analysis of Nilou’s pull value in Genshin Impact.


A word of caution: I would label Nilou as “whale bait.” She’s decently strong at Constellation 0 with free weapons, but splurging on Constellations and her signature Sword results in noticeable damage increases. Keep this in mind when pulling for her since the added incentive to keep pulling might affect you more than you realize.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ahead of 1999, players received the AX-52 assault rifle in Warframe. It’s a weapon that is much more than meets the eye, so if you’re looking for a solid build for the AX-52 to carry you through almost everything Warframe has to offer, look no further.


Best AX-52 build in Warframe


The AX-52 is a strong automatic rifle that has a really high critical chance and multiplier. Its status chance is also something to not look past, especially since it only has Puncture as a damage type. Lastly, its passive ability gives you ammo efficiency when firing at the hip and a 100% critical chance bonus when aiming and hitting headshots.


With all that said, here’s a build to really make all of its strengths shine:



Vital Sense


Critical Delay


Malignant Force


Rime Rounds


Galvanized Aptitude


Serration


Galvanized Chamber


Hunter Munitions


Exilus: Vigilante Supplies


Arcane: Primary Merciless



Screenshot by Destructoid


If you do not have the Galvanized mods, you can replace them with the following:



Galvanized Aptitude: Heavy Caliber, Hammer Shot, Rifle Elementalist, or Vigilante Armaments


Galvanized Chamber: Split Chamber



With this mod setup, you’re heavily increasing all the stats above while also adding Viral and Slash to the mix of status procs dealt. It’ll be versatile across all factions, making this a critical machine that chews through armor and health. It'll only struggle a bit against Corpus shields, but it should still do just fine.


What makes the weapon versatile is that it does great work whether you’re a good shot or not. 


If you can’t trust yourself to hit headshots while aiming, then you can opt for hipfire. It won’t deal easy orange criticals, but the ammo efficiency will allow you to stack more viral, slash, and puncture procs onto enemies.


Either way, you’re going to be softening up mobs by just spraying and praying with this mod setup.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nilou teams are capable of significant damage, but there’s a catch. Nilou’s ability to turn everyday Dendro Cores into potent bombs only works when her teammates are all Dendro or Hydro. So, given this strict team restriction, what are Nilou’s best teams?


Teambuilding advice for Nilou


Nilou’s best teams are usually double Dendro, double Hydro. This means there should be a total of two Dendro characters and two Hydro characters, including Nilou herself. Having two of each element means you can trigger Bloom more often, resulting in more Dendro Cores and more explosions. While you can try to increase Bloom damage by building Elemental Mastery on your characters, it’s often better to just maximize the sheer number of Blooms by applying as much Dendro and Hydro as possible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Genshin Impact’s Nilou is truly one of a kind. She doesn’t contribute much raw DPS, but she’s not a support, either, since her teams have to be built around her. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to actually play Nilou in Genshin Impact.


How Nilou’s Skill works


Nilou’s Elemental Skill is activated by pressing her Skill key once. Once activated, you’ll see a blue icon above her head. In this activated state, you can follow up with three more Skills or Normal Attacks, which will all deal Hydro damage. Depending on whether you end this combo with a Skill or Normal Attack, Nilou will gain different abilities. You must complete Nilou’s Skill combo to activate her Bloom buffs, so make sure the blue icon above her head disappears before proceeding with your rotation.

This means that anybody will be able to sign up on the official Soulframe website, reserve their Envoy name, and almost instantly get into the game.


At the time of writing, anybody can sign up and reserve their Envoy name for Soulframe, but invites are sent out  every week on a first-come-first-served basis. This means that there's sometimes quite a long delay between signing up and getting an invitation. Fall 2024 will see the system completely change, opening the game up to so many more players and allowing the fan base to grow exponentially.

During TennoCon 2024, fans were shown a brand new slice of gameplay featuring some updates and new features coming to the game's early access program, Soulframe Preludes, later this year. 


Soulframe is a wonderful title that puts players in the role of an envoy in a world inspired by folk stories and tales of fae. It's an ARPG with some of the soulslike mechanics you may expect from the genre, but Digital Extremes has put its own strange twist on not only the genre, but the game's entire world to make it feel fresh, vibrant, and full of life.

It's been over four years since this writer last spoke to George Perkins of Super Rare Games, the boutique publisher of limited-run physical Switch releases which set up shop back in 2018.
Since then the firm has branched out into both physical PS5 releases and digital publishing, and with its catalogue of physical Switch games now standing at a whopping 115, it seems that despite the tumultuous state of the gaming industry right now and the long-heralded decline of physical media, there's more than enough interest to keep a company like Super Rare in rude health.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 1:00 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, which includes those perks, will have its monthly price raised from $17 to $20.

You'll likely be familiar with the Western design already: it features Classic Sonic, Modern Sonic, and Shadow all looking suitable badass against a backdrop of what we're assuming is one of Shadow's levels. The Japanese version, meanwhile, highlights the apparent rivalry between Sonic and Shadow, showcasing the two hedgehogs in a kind of jin-and-jang juxtaposition.

Deep in the Dark Place of Alan Wake 2 there is a forest that is not a forest - a zig-zag tunnel adorned with murals of a grisly woodland scene. Entering that tunnel, you find yourself sealed in at either end. But the mural suggests a way out: it changes when you turn around, following an unspoken narrative. It's a device as delicate as the graffiti elsewhere in the Dark Place is obnoxious. In hindsight, it feels like an example of "metsänpeitto", a concept from Finnish folklore about forests which, as writer Sinikka Annala explains, saturates the design of Alan Wake 2. It's a fascinating idea I'd love certain much larger, less intriguing video game worlds to learn from.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our former editor Katharine "Thorsbane" Castle has long since quit these turgid shores for the sunny uplands of Eurogamer, where the consoles multiply like rabbits, but her legacy endures. For instance, it's thanks to her that I know and am excited about Roots of Yggdrasil, a roguelike deck-and-city-builder which casts you as a posse of vikings in a flying longship, touching down on floating islands to found a quick settlement and harvest some magic before the apocalypse - here known as the Ginnungagap, a swirling purple void - catches up with them.
Katharine called it "a real grower" before the early access release in January, likening it to both Dorfromantik and The Banished Vault - a chalk and cheese comparison if ever I heard one. Well rejoice, perverted chalk-and-cheese mixers, because Roots of Yggdrasil now has a 1.0 release date - 6th September 2024.

Developer Phoenix Labs has released a brand-new bug-squashing update for Fae Farm and it's available on Switch right now.
Away from the game's big DLC additions that we have seen pop up over the last year, the ver. 3.1.0 update is all about fixing what's there. In a thank you message shared on the Fae Farm website, the developer states that it has "finally had the chance to take a breath, and look over our known issues lists" after the release of the 'Skies of Azoria' DLC and so this update is all about the "changes and improvements we’ve been wanting to make across the game".

Forget your lore-establishing backstories. Forget your character introductions. Forget your long cutscenes. A game's opening needs to be fast, it needs to be exciting, and it needs to throw us into the action as quickly as possible. At least, that's according to Masahiro Sakurai's latest YouTube video.
The legendary game designer is back with another masterclass and this one is all about starting with a bang. "If you're going to make a game," Sakurai says, "consider kicking things off with a climactic scene right from the start!" Over the ensuing two minutes, he shows examples of just that.

Especially the Game Pass build, which is significantly worse for it.

He shouldn't have slept with the Queen's sister, for example. He shouldn't have insisted his lover subsequently pay him for a confession to absolve herself of the guilt accrued from sleeping with him. He shouldn't have felt safe in a room next to the Queen, a woman described as "reckless" in her character traits, and who is perilously close to having a nervous breakdown. This, my holy friend, is how your bed chamber becomes a raging inferno. 
By the end of my first game of Norland, the village of Nandos (you can name your own settlements) is covered in more blood than the back end of the bard's best work. In storytelling terms, it is a tragedy. In terms of fantasy management games? It is great fun. The failure cascade as waterslide.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paramount has canceled Halo, the live-action TV adaptation of Xbox’s flagship franchise, after two seasons. The show’s second season premiered on Paramount+ earlier this year. 
According to The Hollywood Reporter’s sources, Halo showrunners Amblin, Xbox, and 343 Industries are seeking a new outlet for a potential third season, with Paramount reportedly supporting the move. 
“Paramount+ can confirm that ‘Halo’ will not move forward with a third season on the service,” Paramount said in a statement. “We are extremely proud of this ambitious series and would like to thank our partners at Xbox, 343 Industries and Amblin Television, along with showrunner and executive producer David Wiener, his fellow executive producers, the entire cast led by Pablo Schreiber as Master Chief and the amazing crew for all their outstanding work. We wish everyone the best going forward.”
After years of development, Halo premiered on Paramount+ on March 24, 2022, and stars Pablo Schreiber as Master Chief. Season 1 received a mixed reception from critics and fans, with many lambasting it for deviating from the games’ established lore and characterizations. Season 2, which premiered earlier this year on February 8 and concluded on March 21, was received more positively, with several critics and viewers hailing it as a dramatic improvement. Season 1 currently sits at 70% on Rotten Tomatoes/61 on Metacritic. Season 2 garnered a 90% on Rotten Tomatoes/64 on Metacritic.

Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn does its best to provide an epic adventure despite clear limitations. This semi-open world action game’s bright spots include an exciting premise, a unique tag-team spin on Souls-inspired combat, and an entertaining exploration mechanic. Unfortunately, it falls short of providing a wholly satisfying or polished adventure, resulting in a respectable but flawed revenge quest.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's Frogger, but emotional.
Though 3D platformers often go down the collectathon route to varying success, it can be interesting to see new entries in the genre try something a little different. SCHiM is one such fresh title, eschewing a focus on cartoonish characters, wacky levels, and mountains of things to grab in favor of a semi-narratively driven adventure that just offers a beautiful, artful experience. SCHiM may not be the kind of game that’s ‘fun’ in the way that most other platformers are, but it’ll stick out as a memorable bright spot when you think back through the new releases you tried out this year.
SCHiM’s story is told through a series of pantomimed cutscenes, leaving a lot of room for interpretation. You begin by playing as a shadow frog quietly following the adventures of a young boy enjoying his childhood, and you're right there with him as he rapidly grows up and experiences the various joys and hardships of life. After the poor dude gets dumped and loses his job in a round of layoffs, you're suddenly separated from him, leaving the young man without a shadow. Thus begins your long journey across the shadows of the world to make your way back to him.

NetherRealm Studios, the developer behind the Mortal Kombat series, is reportedly facing multiple layoffs after select staff members from the studios' mobile team shared posts on LinkedIn announcing that they have been put out of work (thanks, Eurogamer).
The NetherRealm mobile team seems to be the most affected by the layoffs, after the branch was reportedly shut down despite working on multiple active live-service projects including Mortal Kombat Mobile, Injustice 2, and Mortal Kombat Onslaught. Tony Lazzara, a quality assurance analyst, wrote "Netherrealm’s mobile team was shut down. A ton of very talented people were put out of work".

It’s something I always appreciate in films (Brendy mentioned Fleabag, I brought up Shane Meadows), and although the flow of many of Exodus’ scenes were quite awkward, it was still refreshing to see a game break away from the common, unnatural back-and-forth line delivery. Bioshock and Judas’s Ken Levine has a name for this - “turn-based dialogue.” According to Levine, it’s “one of the biggest problems” in the way games portray conversations.

        <updated>2024-07-19T01:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Skeleton Crew, the team behind the 2021 side-scrolling action game Olija, and Devolver Digital have revealed an intriguing new project: Forestrike. The game sports a unique premise: as a martial artist, you can foresee and simulate future combat encounters, allowing you to perfect your execution before laying a finger on anyone. 
The fighter battles to free a captive Emperor from an evil Admiral, and doing so involves mastering Foresight, a meditative technique to mentally predict and play out battles before they unfold (for Dragon Ball fans, think of image training). Gameplay-wise, players are pitted against different combinations of enemy types. They use Foresight to play the battle in advance to find the optimal approach to defeating them while taking little to no damage.
For example, using Foresight may help you learn to dodge a charging enemy so they trample an ally, then finish him off by lobbing a nearby weapon. Determining the best approach may take several Foresight attempts, but once you have your strategy down, you then execute the battle in real-time. After winning a fight, a replay feature allows you to rewatch it using slow-motion and other editing tools to study your strategy or generally feel cool about your performance. 


Using the Foresight makes Forestrike's combat feel puzzle-like in its execution, and winning fights as flawlessly as possible matters. That’s because you have limited health to fight through multiple stages in a roguelike-style branching map. Along the way, you’ll earn upgrades that carry over to future runs, as well as perks called Techniques that enhance your abilities. 
Forestrike is a neat spin on the action genre, and it's slated to launch sometime in 2025 for Switch and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A good immersive sim, by its very nature, offers myriad varied approaches to solving problems. And yet, I find myself wanting to get hyper-specific when writing about the action of Corpus Edax, because it has an incredibly gratifying metal pipe sound, whether you’re stealthy wrapping it around the back of a blissfully unaware fool’s noggin, or lobbing it directly at their knee caps. In fact - although the game does have a delightful array of classic verbs, along with a few surprises - many of them are simply conducive to a stirring round of fisticuffs, to write my most British sentence of the week.

The new game brings back said wormhole-based carnage together with newly "faction-forward" teamplay, and if you want to know what "faction-forward" means when it's at home, I encourage you to stick your whole head into the below crackling cinematic trailer-vortex. I promise nothing bad will happen to it on the other side.

        <updated>2024-07-18T13:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Splitgate’s combination of Halo-esque first-person shooter with Portal-inspired portal jumping mechanics made it quite the sensation when it launched in open beta in 2021. With its servers regularly buckling under the weight of its players, the game caught lightning in a bottle but petered out when the game finally went 1.0 and simultaneously ceased receiving support in 2022. Now, developer 1047 Games is back with Splitgate 2 and aims to refine the original's winning formula. 


Like the first game, Splitgate 2 will be a free-to-play 4v4 shooter that arms players with a portal gun and more traditional firearms to battle each other in aerial, dimension-hopping combat. The sequel is being built in Unreal Engine 5 and has a new emphasis on factions. Players can suit up to compete in the Sol Splitgate League as members of one of three groups: the agile Aeros, the time-manipulating Meridian, or the trigger-happy Sabrask. According to a press release, “Factions will grant players the ability to choose and progress based on their preferred gameplay style or competitive strategies.” Splitgate 2 will feature new objective-based game modes across new arenas and upgradable weapons. 
Additionally, a special Splitgate 2 companion app is available to download now. The app lets players explore the game’s universe through collectibles that unlock in-game rewards when Splitgate 2 launches. It also features quizzes and a new comic series called Splitgate: The Games We Play. The five-issue series will flesh out the backstory of the characters featured in the announcement trailer and additional issues will arrive monthly. 
Splitgate 2 launches in 2025 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Check out the first batch of screenshots below.]]></summary>

Friends, Romans and countrymen: this is a game about a war between two sets of body-stealing monsters, waged in the neon shadows of a fictional East Asian city. It all puts me strongly in mind of a certain John Carpenter movie about squelchy goings-on in Antarctica.

And what's frustrating is that I just don't get on with them, despite knowing that they can convey brilliant stories through all sorts of interesting cuts and shots and whatnot. I'm sorry to report that certain stories won't grab me if they're not ticking along at just the right pace or if they don't pull me in straight away. I'm a needy soul, someone who demands immediacy and a special emotional sauce.
Until Then is, without a doubt, the only visual novel-y game I've truly enjoyed. In fact, I'd say I've more than enjoyed it - I think it's superb so far. The teens that drive this story are written with an authenticity I've not encountered before, and the 3D interwoven with the 2D adds some surprising - besides the literal - depth.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If DICE's Battlefield series lacks for one feature, it's surely the option to dig trenches. Properly dig them, I mean, not just waft them into existence with a wave of your magic trowel, a la Battlefield V. Think Minecraft, but with howitzers instead of Creepers. I have never been to war, but I do own several shovels, and let me tell you, if I ever hear artillery fire or even just dangerously raised voices round these parts, the first thing I will do is tunnel straight down.
Fuck it, I might do that if I read any negative comments on this news piece. Vex me not with your pestilent talk of "map balancing". Watch this trailer for Flying Squirrel's new FPS Over The Top WW1 instead. It abounds with trench-digging, and it looks like you can make some decent-sized craters, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo is, relatively speaking, a family-oriented company. Their games are aimed at kids, their parents, and everyone in between with bright colors, wholesome storytelling, and extremely approachable game design. That said, there are exceptions to this rule, like in this creepy 15-second teaser uploaded to the company's YouTube channel last week. A man in a trench coat wearing a paper bag with a smile drawn on it stares into the camera while a distorted music box plays in the background. The only additional context we got was the hashtag #WhoIsEmio, leaving fans scrambling to figure out what exactly this was hinting at.
Today, that mystery has been cleared up. Emio, also known as "The Smiling Man," is the star of a new game in the Famicom Detective Club series, which hasn't had a new entry in 35 years. The game was revealed today alongside a video featuring series producer Yoshio Sakamoto, who wrote the first two games and went on to direct titles like Super Metroid and Metroid: Zero Mission. According to him, they decided to make this new entry during their time developing the Famicom Detective Club remakes back in 2021.
"In Emio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club, a student has been found dead in a chilling fashion, his head covered with a paper bag with an eerie smiling face drawn on it," a press release reads. "This unsettling visage bears a striking resemblance to a recurring clue in a string of unsolved murders from 18 years ago, as well as Emio (the Smiling Man), a killer of urban legend who is said to grant his victims 'a smile that will last forever.'" Players will assume the role of a private investigator and set out to solve the case and stop the killer for good.
Emio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club will be released for the Nintendo Switch next month, on August 29. Hopefully, the titular killer won't murder too many people before then.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in 2011, Robot Entertainment released tower defender Orcs Must Die!, adding an exclamation mark to spark some urgency and also, irritate anybody who has to write about video games for a living, though not as much as the absolute maniacs behind Tom Clancy's H.A.W.X. Evidently, players did not sufficiently meet their demand for wanton Orc-massacring, for Robot were forced to release two sequels, which I personally would have titled Orcs Must Die!! and Orcs Must Die!!! or perhaps Orcs Must Die!!?, to indicate a mounting existential crisis.
Now, Robot have stepped things up by announcing Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap, a newly roguelite, four-player spin on the goblin-farming formula, whose subheading throws bumbling Orc murderers a bone by specifying that you might try building a trap of some kind, a deathtrap possibly. Please find below a suspiciously innocent trailer, which I promise you isn't covering a wall of arrow launchers or similar.

Rather than just being routes around to the other side of a barred door - though there are plenty such Lordrannish loops to find in this game - they consist of aerial chains of magic, purple triangles that suck you toward them when you hold a button. They lend vigour to a branching, faux-Napoleonic world that might otherwise be a collection of atmospheric strolls between bonfire-equivalents and fights defined by taut resourcing systems. They're idiot-proof grappling points from which you can launch yourself at another triangle, a ledgeful of upgrade materials, or a loitering musketeer who is in urgent need of a ground-pound.

NES games are difficult to revisit. They’re easy to find and play, but they are showing their age and have been for some time. To play the original Legend of Zelda, for example, rewards a difficult-to-control, often obtuse puzzle game whose importance to the industry is undeniable, but its contemporary fun factor is low. Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition counters this with a strategy that WarioWare has been using to great effect since its inception: you only play classic Nintendo games for exactly as long as they’re fun – which in 2024 is anywhere from three secon…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fmovies, one of the most visited pirate sites in the world, has been unreachable for more than a day. Earlier this month, the site stopped displaying new releases, which in itself was unusual. Without any explanation from the team, some fear that the operators have discontinued the Fmovies brand, which had established itself as streaming piracy's poster child over the years.

In your hand is a clicker counter. Moose-face stares. What do those eyes convey? Patience? Intent? Longing? If nothing else, they betray a deep certainty that whatever else happens, you’re going to click. If you stop clicking for a moment, a prompt appears in the corner telling you the controls. At least, I think it's a prompt, because it might actually be a threat.
Left click to click. He'd like you to click 10,000 times, please.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Xbox 360 digital store shuts down later this month on July 26. Amid a wave of price reductions and other end-of-life updates, nostalgic fans can relive the console's earliest days via a new dynamic background modeled after the old “Blades” interface.
For those too young to remember or didn’t get an Xbox 360 until years later, the Blades interface was the console's first dashboard design. It was the first thing players saw from the console’s launch in 2005 until it was updated to an entirely different interface in 2008. Navigating it felt smooth as butter, and some diehards still believe it's the best UI of any Xbox console. 
Although it's less detailed, and you can’t flip through the Blades of this dynamic background and hear that satisfying “whoosh” sound, it’s nice to see Microsoft acknowledge the 360's like this. Here’s how you to make the Blades your Xbox background:
Press the Xbox button on your controller to open the guide.
Navigate to Profile & system > Settings > General > Personalization > My background > Dynamic backgrounds.
Choose Xbox 360 Blades under Featured or Xbox dynamic backgrounds
Select the background art you want using the A button.

        <updated>2024-07-16T17:33:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dead by Daylight’s 8th-anniversary stream revealed a few big updates for the popular asymmetrical horror game. The most immediate is the addition of Lara Croft as the game’s latest crossover survivor along with the impending addition of the much-requested 2v8 mode. 
Tomb Raider Chapter
Lara Croft (the 2013 reboot version, specifically) joins DBD today, and though she lacks her pistols and bow, she sports three new perks highlighting her adventuring prowess. Here's an explanation of each per DBD's website:
Finesse: Your fast vaults are faster when healthy, with a cooldown after a successful use.
Hardened: When you open a Chest and cleanse or bless a Totem, Hardened activates for the duration of the Trial. From that point, every time you scream, you’ll instead reveal the Killer’s Aura.
Specialist: When you open or rummage through a Chest, gain 1 Token (up to 3). When you do a Great Skill Check, consume a Token to reduce the max required Generator progress.


2v8 Mode
On July 25, a new 2v8 multiplayer mode descends into the game. This pits two Killers against eight survivors in expanded versions of five classic maps. The number of generators has been doubled, and Survivors must now repair 8 out of 13 to escape. Captive Survivors are now sent directly into cages, and Survivor perks have been reworked into a new role system designed to encourage teamwork. 


Cross-Progression
Cross-progression is being implemented on July 22. This means players can now sync their progress across multiple owned versions of the game. Everything can be shared across any platform except for Switch, which has a few restrictions as you can see in the chart below. 
Today’s stream also revealed a new trailer and the release date for The Casting of Frank Stone, the single-player DBD game developed by Supermassive Games (Until Dawn, The Quarry). You can read all about that here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Casting of Frank Stone, Supermassive Games’ single-player narrative-driven horror game set in the Dead by Daylight universe, has a release date. This intriguing horror collaboration will arrive on September 3, and a new trailer provides a proper introduction of the main cast. 
Developed by Supermassive (Until Dawn, The Quarry) and published by Dead by Daylight developer Behaviour Interactive, The Casting of Frank Stone stars five teenagers – Christine Gordon, Jaime Rivera, Linda Castle, Robert Green, and Bonnie Rivera – who film their own horror movie in an abandoned steel mill. Unfortunately, this mill has ties to a notorious murderer named Frank Stone, and the youth’s innocent art project goes horribly wrong.


We still don’t know much about the narrative other than that it is set within the world of Dead by Daylight and takes place in the town of Cedar Mills during the summer of 1980. Gameplay-wise, The Casting of Frank Stone follows a similar blueprint to Supermassive’s previous horror titles in that it’s a choice-driven adventure where characters can be permanently killed off based on your decisions. You can check out a recent gameplay trailer here to see it in action. 
The Casting of Frank Stone is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The word "kiss" occurs 10 times in the latest blog post for the seventh major Baldur's Gate 3 patch, while the word "bug" occurs 14 times. I think this ratio captures how BG3 updates at large walk the line between dealing with stuff like progression blockers, and sating the inexhaustible horniness of the fanbase. There's more to patch 7 than glitch-hunting and snogs, however. Due in September, it introduces dynamic splitscreen functionality, expansions for Honour mode, modding tools, new endings for evil playthroughs, and a brace of tweaks for Origin characters.

Take Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 4060, whose positioning in the RTX 40 series hierarchy would suggest an affordable mid-range GPU, yet routinely pushes £300. Here, though, you can nab the Gigabyte GeForce RTX 4060 Windforce OC edition at a 15% discount, bringing it down to a far more agreeable £238. Nice.

Here is when you can jump into each beta: 
Weekend 1: Early Access (for preorder customers/Xbox Game Pass subscribers) - August 30 at 10 a.m. PT to September 4 at 10 a.m. PT

Not bad, for a device with a higher-rez display and more graphical horsepower than the Steam Deck or Steam Deck OLED.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My favourite ever mode of travel in games is flying, so I was already poised (in mid-air) to really enjoy swooping around the world of Flock. It's a gentle exploration game from the people who brought you Wimot's Warehouse and I Am Dead (including Pip Warr, RPS in peace) where you never touch the ground, instead gliding around the strange forests and rippling meadows atop a giant bird with a beautiful trailing tail. Big Journey vibes, but more whimsical and colourful.

While I do think this is a rather metal logo, there's an argument to be made that it's not current or trendy enough. With this in mind, I think the words "Call Of Duty" should represent the endless, unstoppable nature of existence. And with Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 revealing its multiplayer open beta and early access dates, we must further consume and be consumed by the circular march of COD. Let's dolphin dive in, shall we.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know as much about programming video game monsters as I do the exact flavour and consistency of the sands on Mars, but I've always thought the chief advantage of the Slime monster archetype is its economy. A slime, in most games, is a squashy smiley face. Why, I could grow myself one of those right this very instant, by doodling a circle in MS Paint and squinting very hard. Slimes do take more complex forms - chrome slimes, fire slimes, slimes with angry eyebrows, etc - but come now, it's not on the same level as rebooting Lara Croft's hair to billow in the blowback from grenades.
The simplicity of slime creation may soon become a distant memory, however, for Epic Games tech artist and current Duck Shake Games Asher Zhu is hell-bent on reinventing the homely Dragon Quest sludgeball as a technical tour de force on par with his previous contributions to Unreal Engine showcase Matrix Awakens. That's the impression I garner from the below video of Zhu's latest project, anyway, whose description also tantalises with talk of "Splatoon mechanics in dungeons".

It’s a first person pilot-em-up that puts you in the cockpit of a grasshoppery rust-bucket carrying out a critical mission on an industrial desert planet. The more the intro text stresses the importance of this mission, the more guiltily useless I feel, because I cannot get this beautifully run-down mech to do anything of note, unless you count violently hopping into walls to be notable.

As such, those companions are key to everything happening in Veilguard. 
With such a significant emphasis on these characters, I spoke to some of the game's leads to learn precisely about BioWare's philosophy on companions in Veilguard.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed, the video game follow-up to last year’s TMNT: Mutant Mayhem animated film, has its first trailer and a release date. The game was first announced last September. 
A Heartful of Games is developing the game, which retains the stylized Spider-Verse-inspired art direction from the hit film. The story unfolds after the movie's events and sees Leo, Raph, Donny, and Mikey battling a new wave of mutants invading New York City. 


As previously covered in our exclusive preview earlier this year, Mutant Mayhem is a third-person action/platformer game, and each turtle features a unique playstyle. The game also supports up to two-player local co-op. 
TMNT: Mutants Unleashed launches on October 18 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. The game is also getting a fancy Collector Edition, and you can see the contents of that here. Mutants Unleashed is one of several TMNT games to arrive in recent years (and the third in 2024 alone, following Wrath of the Mutants and the Switch port of Splintered Fate), and you can read all about the franchise’s history in video games in our in-depth retrospective.]]></summary>

It’s a great hospital, by the way. Spotlight-headed phantasma shamble about corridors reminiscent of The Division 2 or The Last Of Us’s naturalia.
Striking, but also within easy reach of comparisons. And if Once Human was purely the collection of x from ys it very much appears to be, I’m not sure I’d have much positive to say about it. On the surface, what you're getting here is a 6/10 third-person shooter from ten years ago that gleefully spills thumbtacks along any simple paths to progress with live service obfuscation, propped up by a detached crafting and building economy that has you popping mined rocks and chopped wood in the oven then taking out freshly baked shotguns a few minutes later. Its systems run the gamut from numbly enjoyable to being a source of major psychic damage, and even the simple act of replacing your initial tier I rustic baseball cap means navigating several menus, currencies, and resources.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat 1’s final Year 1 DLC fighter arrives next week, and it’s Takeda Takahashi. The young Shirai Ryu warrior makes only his second appearance in a Mortal Kombat game and looks every bit as capable as his older clanmates, Scorpion and Smoke. 
Although Takeda was Kenshi’s son in his debut appearance, Mortal Kombat X, the remixed timeline of Mortal Kombt 1 has changed him to Kenshi’s cousin. Like Kenshi, Takeda grew up a Yakuza but was more faithful to the clan than his cousin. As such, the Yakuza tasked Takeda with killing Kenshi, and the two battled, with the latter coming emerging victorious. Takeda was mortally wounded in the battle and rushed to the aid of the Shirai Ryu, where Kenshi protected him from being killed by the Yakuza for failing his mission. This causes Takeda to have a change of heart and join the Shirai Ryu to wage war against Earthrrealm’s criminal underground and, eventually, the evil forces of Outworld. 
Takeda still utilizes the Shirai Ryu fighting style, including his signature pair of bladed whips. He also sports shurikens, a barrage of teleporting flame attacks, and an aerial grapple best described as mid-air corkscrew piledriver. Check Takeda out below.  


Takeda will be available on July 23, both as a standalone purchase and as a free download for Kombat Pack owners. The same day also sees previously revealed Kameo fighter Ferra become available to buy. Both Takeda and Ferra will be playable for the first time during Evo 2025 this weekend.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crocs and Pokémon are teaming up again for another collaboration, this time bringing four classic Generation 1 pocket monsters into the shoe line sometime this year. This news comes by way of Sole Retriever, which reports that Crocs is releasing four new pairs of shoes, each themed after a specific Kanto Pokémon: Charizard, Gengar, Snorlax, and Jigglypuff. 
Though there isn't a release date for these Crocs yet – Sole Retriever simply reports 2024 – we know each will cost $70. While each pair has unique theming based on the Pokémon it's representing, each pair of Crocs comes with Jibbitz, which are the detachable charms on the tops of the shoes, the classic Pokémon title on back of the shoe strap, and the classic Pokéball logo as the buttons holding each of the straps in place. 
Charizard

Gengar

Snorlax

Jigglypuff

Sole Retriever says these Crocs will be available through Crocs and online and in-store retailers. 
While waiting to learn more, read about an upcoming Nike x Tekken 8 shoe collaboration.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Death Game Hotel came out last week - a comically gory game in which players play casino-style card games around a table and raise the stakes by betting their own limbs. It's a VR game, which is a break from the norm for White Owls, the studio run by Hidetaka "Swery" Suehiro (then again, what is their "norm"?). It's also got a big multiplayer component, with lots of jovial bubble-popping and chicken-squeezing between the comedy blood spurts. And this taste of multiplayer mischief has Swery's head percolating. This game won't be his last dipped toe in the multiplayer ocean, he told us.
"In the future," said Swery, "I would like to leverage this experience to challenge myself with something new in the online multiplayer realm (something you probably haven't even imagined yet)."

One could, I believe, make a convincing argument for Yakuza 0 being - if not the best videogame ever made - then at least the most videogame. While this coming October’s Amazon series won’t be the first live action adaption of Yakuza, I am hopeful its episodic format will give its characters a bit more room to breathe. Or, according to Kiryu actor Ryoma Takeuchi in an interview with IGN, to find the love they’ve always longed for.

Supraworld, the sequel to toybox explorer Supraland, is going to hit early access this year, say developers Supra Games in an update post on Steam. These are happy words for anyone who enjoyed 2019's dander among the sandcastles and erasers. A lot of games offer a "sandbox" but in Supraland, the entire world really did take place in exactly that - a sandbox out in a garden, full of toys. The sequel's launch into early access "might be in october," says the post. "We'll see."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lots of games use frogs as a means to appeal to those who believe they are cute, me being one of those people. The humble croaker dominates the wholesome category, where they take centre stage in farming sims or as detectives or as green lads who hop over platforms and hurt enemies by lashing them with their tongues.
Schim is different: you play as a frog of the shadows, not some green attention-seeker. And in a mundane world of vibrant colour, you're to bounce between patches of shade in search of a human pal whose shadow you've been unwittingly severed from. What ensues is a charming puzzler of both freedom and flow, which genuinely has you view everyday environments through the googly eyes of a phantom amphibian. It's a lovely thing, if perhaps not as emotionally charged as it implies early on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Concord is in beta this weekend and Alex Van Aken and I decided to jump in, play a few rounds, and figure out which characters we liked from the impressive roster. Together we discovered that Lennox, the hot sauce eating green man seen in the game's trailer shouts "exploding knife!" when he throws his exploding knife, but he had nothing on It-Z who had a great SMG, the ability to clone herself when she dodges, and teleportation ability making her easily and indisputably the best character in the game. Alex also liked Duchess. You can check out the archive of the full stream below.


For a while lot more on Concord, which releases on PlayStation 5 and PC August on August 23, head here to read about how it plays like Destiny meets Overwatch.

In its fifth major expansion, Dawntrail, Final Fantasy XIV is facing its biggest existential crisis yet: where does your story go now that its 10-year A-plot is over? Dawntrail forges ahead with an enjoyable summer adventure to the land of Tural, doubling as a trojan horse for what lies in store for the future of the long-running MMO’s story. Dawntrail doesn’t match the narrative highs of the previous pair of expansions and is flawed in several ways, but its themes of legacy, the importance of culture, and responsible…]]></summary>

Sometimes, honest accessibility aids are falsely accused of being cheating tools; other times, a monitor will straight-up play League of Legends for you. This week, developments in gaming keyboards have sparked a new debate on what does and doesn’t fall within the scope of fair play, with mechanical keeb specialists Wooting declaring in no uncertain terms that "Rappy Snappy is not the same as Snap Tap." Cool, glad that’s cleared up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo added three new games to its Game Boy Advance Nintendo Switch Online library, and though none of the them are Mother 3 (or a Pokémon game or Astro Boy or Drill Dozer or any other GBA game we've been clamoring for) they are none-the-less interesting and completely unexpected.
Starfy isn't a particularly familiar franchise to America players. They have received four games – three for Game Boy Advance, one for DS – but only the 2009 DS game ever released in America. Today, the original three Game Boy Advance games are now available for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers. The games retain their original title, Densetsu no Stafy, and have not been localized. The gameplay has been describe as Kirby-esque, but I have never been able to confirm that myself until today.

The second I wrested this privilege from Ed Thorn's resentful fingers, however, developers Edgeflow Studio and publishers Hooded Horse delayed the early access release. Perhaps this reflects Hooded Horse's atypically forgiving, when-it's-ready approach to game publishing. Or perhaps they just hate me and wish to deny me things that might bring me pleasure. It matters not, because the game now has a new early access release date - 30th August 2024 via Steam, GOG, and the Epic Games Store. Catch a celebratory trailer below.

This rampant enthusiasm for teledoors might seem strange, given that video games are make-believe worlds held together by arbitrary squiggles of magic language. There is fundamentally no reason any video game door should obey the customary laws of spacetime. But don’t let that stop you watching the announcement trailer for Motion Blur’s Black State, a third-person stealth shooter which is heavily redolent of Metal Gear Solid but also, awash with doors that work in mysterious ways.

Following a backlash in the user reviews (the game was Mostly Negative on Steam at launch, but has since risen to Mixed) and on social media, the game's developers Starry Studio have published a blog insisting that they harbour no dark intentions for your personal details - or at least, that they harbour intentions no darker than those of the many other developers who collect your personal information.

Much like its predecessors, it aims to allow users to create games in its chosen genre without any programming experience, using a “node-based visual scripting system” (draggable arrows and concepts, basically). Could this finally be the opportunity to create the legally distinct Little Shop Of Horrors management sim of my dreams? No, of course not. The technology does not yet exist powerful enough to manifest it. Also, it's not an action game. Also, I don't know how to make games. Also it's Friday and I'm tired. Also, AGM isn't out yet. Still, I’m intrigued!

However, his contempt for anonymity drove him to inspire the creation of an upcoming (crowdfunding allowing) graphic novel. The book stars Raziel, the first-born of his lieutenants, and It’s a canonical prequel story to the original Soul Reaver. I have waited a millennium. Over time, I became less human and more…games blogger. I have had the chance to write about Legacy Of Kain precisely once.

Before we properly dive in, Marcus breaks down his review of Anger Foot, developer Free Lives' new first-person shooter. Afterwards, Alex highlights a small desktop game (literally) called Rusty's Retirement. We hope you enjoy this episode and find new games to play!

Welcome to kick-exalting FPS Anger Foot. Violence is brutal and cartoonish. Slight mistakes kill you instantly. The soundtrack slaps. There’s an easy Devolver labelmate orientation point here, but if Hotline Miami was a cocktail of chemical euphoria and gut guilt, like realising you’ve accidentally pocketed someone’s lighter at a festival, Anger Foot is doing whippits out of balloon animals then having a great time rhythmically headbutting a portaloo for a few hours. Similarly, it’s also a bit of a masochistic ordeal to put yourself through. But, man. What a buzz.

Anger Foot exemplifies a simple idea executed to the nth degree. As a furious sneakerhead possessing seemingly the deadliest legs in the world, you must retrieve your prized collection of stolen footwear by kicking everything in sight. The bombast accompanying this wacky premise – fast-paced, split-second action, satisfying gunplay, and delectable destructibility – turns Anger Foot from a one-kick pony into one of the year’s most exciting, challenging, and tough-to-put-down adrenaline rushes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Planet Coaster 2 arrives later this year and its big update, alongside all the rollercoaster and theme park simulation gameplay of the first title, is the inclusion of water park mechanics. You will be able to create water slides, wave pools, lazy rivers, and more. You will also be able to visit your friend's parks and build together in a shared sandbox mode (though you will apparently have to build one at a time) across platforms. You can check out the announcement trailer below.


Frontier is promising its first look at gameplay on July 31, and Planet Coaster 2 will arrive later this year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. To read Game Informer's Planet Coaster review, follow the link.]]></summary>

Righetti says that at times it may appear that Italy's Piracy Shield blocking system is malfunctioning or ineffective, but that's not true. It's all down to pirates' use of "sophisticated services" offered by American intermediaries.  Fortunately, the solution is straightforward; force companies like Cloudflare into compliance and prosecute users.

Not for me it isn't, because now I have to compare my shabby flat, in which there are exactly zero waterslides at the time of publication, with Planet Coaster 2, in which you can expect such aquatic attractions as "meandering lazy rivers", "adrenaline-pumping wave pools", "looping flumes" and "exhilarating water coasters". Please watch the trailer while I yet again revisit the possibility of sneaking into Stoke-On-Trent's Waterworld and trying to pass myself off as the resident ghost.

        <updated>2024-07-11T14:04:49.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Double Dragon series has been around since the arcades in 1987 and has managed to maintain a surprisingly consistent release cadence in those more than 35 years. It was only last year that we played Double Dragon Gaiden, a pixelated throwback brawler (or belt-scroll action game, per its official YouTube description) take on the franchise.
This next entry is decidedly more modern, with fully 3D visuals. It's not the first time the series has explored this dimension, but it is a rare occurrence. The game is being developed by Yuke's, the developer that worked on the WWE 2K franchise until 2K19 and most recently developed AEW: Fight Forever. It is being published, or presented by, as the trailer implies, Arc System Works, the developer behind Guilty Gear and Dragon Ball FighterZ.
Double Dragon Revive is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and One, and PC sometime in 2025.


For a whole lot more on Double Dragon, but maybe not the version of Double Dragon you're thinking, head here to read all about the 1994 movie. Back in 2019, I tracked down the film's director, James Yukich, to talk about the bizarre film's trajectory, what went wrong, and what he would have done differently had he been giving a chance to try making the film again.]]></summary>

This in itself would be borderline post-worthy, but it's also heavily inspired by Game Boy Advance RPGs such as Golden Sun, and features music created by Golden Sun composer Motoi Sakuraba alongside Terranigma composer Masanori Hikichi.

As such, I don’t have enough experience to tell you whether the currently free Pizza Hero is an especially interesting or innovative riff on the formula. However, I am simple-minded enough to enjoy the epic bacon 1.5 humour of a sentient pizza slice with a dog for a companion upgrading itself one topping at a time. This action roguelike reeks of concentrated internet like a week old-slice nestled amidst a stack of free AOL disks. But! It’s cute and fun and free, and that’s enough for me.

And that's when Veilguard game director Corrine Busche smiled, likely knowing full well that nudity in the character creator means nudity elsewhere in the game, like in Veilguard's romances, something I know BioWare fans will be delighted to hear. "This is a mature RPG," she tells me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We haven't written nearly enough about Fallout London, a gargantuan Fallout 4 total conversion that takes place in a whole new map based on England's capital city - the Big Smoke and/or Great Wen, whose real-life incarnation probably harbours at least one nuke at any given moment, though I haven't asked the King about that lately. Best not speculate.
Anyway, Fallout London is a huge effort from modders Team Folon that was recently sabotaged when Bethesda treated Fallout 4 to a next gen update to capitalise on the Amazon TV show's popularity, rendering several mods incompatible and breaking a lot of stuff. Team Folon have now fiddled with the workings and sent a Fallout London build to GOG for QA testing, which suggests that release is imminent. The catch, however, is that you will need to downgrade your copy of Fallout 4 to play the mod, because even with Team Folon's last-minute adjustments, Fallout 4 next gen and Fallout London simply don't get on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starting today, Xbox Game Pass will be experiencing some changes which includes redefining of certain tiers. And later this year, there will be a handful of price increases for various tiers. Here's the exact text as it is presented on Microsoft's website.
Starting July 10, 2024, the following updates to Xbox Game Pass will take effect:
    Price changes will go into effect for new members for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, Xbox Game Pass Core, and PC Game Pass.
    Game Pass for Console will no longer be available for new members.
    Members who are already subscribed to Game Pass for Console and have automatic payment renewal enabled will be able to continue to enjoy their membership.
Also, a new Game Pass option, Xbox Game Pass Standard, will become available in the coming months. These changes will enable us to bring members more value and more great games to Game Pass.
The new Xbox Game Pass Standard tier for new members will be $15 a month and will not include access to Day One releases, EA Play, Game Pass for PC, and cloud gaming.
Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, which includes access to all the bonuses now not included in the Standard tier is increasing its price from $17 a month to $20.
Xbox Game Pass Core, which offers online access and a much smaller library of curated games, is changing its yearly from $60 to $75. The $10 monthly price for that tier, however, will remain unchanged.
PC Game Pass is increasing from $10 per month to $12, but that tier will still include Day One releases.
All of these price changes will be reflected starting on September 12.
Price changes for services you already pay for are always frustrating. What do you think of the change? Do you plan on maintaining your subscription? Or is it time to cancel?]]></summary>

Zenless Zone Zero is a game deeply informed by the philosophy of juice. Like the lootbox hawkers of yesteryear, gacha designers understand the appeal and power of a pleasingly animated gizmo, ker-chunking open and fizzing with potential. This poppy visual and sonic language stretches across Hoyo's latest game, from its cinematic moments, to each character's attacks, to the cute bunny mascots that erupt into gatling guns, to the barista's coffee-making ritual and the recipes of the robo-limbed noodle server. The menu screens, the maps, the free-to-play storefront, everything. It is all very juicy. It is pumped with juice, but only in the same way supermarket chicken is pumped with water.

Yes, yes, it’s a metaphor, but we don’t have time for all that. Your kingdom is under attack by goblins, and the only way to get your useless underlings to chop the wood, till the fields, and train the guards needed to defend it is to provide constant surveillance. The King Is Watching is a minimalist resource-chain-em-up and wave defense goblin-knocker with a brilliant twist. I'm now a little bit obsessed with it, I think, and what is RPS if not a vehicle for chronicling my many fleeting obsessions?

Even fantastic games like Baldur's Gate 3 suffered from this overly obliging approach to relationships. A game letting you tell your own tales is dandy and all, but those stories don’t mean much if the cast feel like input/output affection bots, ready to drop trou like a clumsy Levis temp once you’ve adequately filled their invisible bonkometer.

After half a decade on shelves, it’s still the best low-profile mechanical gaming keyboard going, and quite possibly the best wireless keyboard to boot – while the tenkeyless version, the G915 TKL Lightspeed, is just as lovely to use.
Between their nimble performance, crisp mech switches, and impeccable build quality, the only way in which the G915 duo underwhelms is their high pricing – very much the kind you’d want to wait for a Prime Day or Black Friday to dull the pain of. Now, though, there’s an alternative: the new Logitech G515 Lightspeed TKL. I’ve been using it. It’s good!

That's because developer Sucker Punch Production's Ghost of Tsushima, which originally launched on PlayStation 4 back in 2020, was the best-selling game of May 2024 in the U.S. And that's almost assuredly due to the recent PC release of Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut on May 16. 
Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut hit PC almost four years after the game's initial launch on PS4, which speaks to PlayStation's PC release strategy it detailed last month. It said its live-service games, like this year's Helldivers 2 or the upcoming 5v5 hero shooter Concord, will launch day-and-date on PC, but its tentpole single-player games, like Ghost of Tsushima Directo…]]></summary>

According to ragdoll-prone shooter Helldivers 2, however, it’s better to stand to attention in mid-air and perform a crisp salute. It’s long been known that the game’s emotes confer unexpected defensive advantages, with emergency hugs sometimes shielding you against artillery fire, but now, one redditor has proven via careful scientific experimentation that they also protect you against the force of gravity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nike and Bandai Namco are teaming up to release a Tekken 8-inspired shoe that will be available for purchase this September. Dubbed "Tekken 8 x Nike Air Foamposite One Fist," these shoes will be available through Nike, SNKRS, and select retailers in-store and online for $250, as reported by Sole Retriever. 
The shoes themselves are inspired specifically by Tekken 8's primary antagonist, Kazuya Mishima, as the colorway of the shoe is basically a spin on his outfit in-game. Sole Retriever describes the shoes as featuring an iridescent Foamposite material across the design's upper region in armory navy, with a faux crocodile skin texture across the Foamposite material, and black hues over the leather eyestays, shoe collar, and tongue. 
Check out the Tekken 8 x Nike Air Foamposite One Fist shoes for yourself below: 

As you can see, the shoes also feature the Tekken logos, a Fist logo with Tekken's signature lighting, and a nice box to hold the shoes. 
Sole Retriever reports that a second colorway in this lineup is on the way and it will reference Jin Kazama, although there's no images of what it will look like yet. 
These Tekken 8 x Nike Air Foamposite One Fist shoes will cost you $250 when they release this September. For more, read Game Informer's Tekken 8 review.

The publishing giant has reportedly closed Piranha Bytes, the studio known for cult RPGs like Gothic, Risen, and Elex, according to a worker who spoke to Polish games site CD-Action. The studio's existence had been under threat since early this year, after being targeted in Embracer's purgatorial studio massacre. At that time the German studio were hopeful to avoid being closed down, insisting "don't write us off yet!" Unfortunately, it looks like those who worked at the studio have since been laid off.

The best-known is probably Frostpunk, with its perpetual raging against the dying of the light, its ceaseless scrape for coal and wood as the temperature falls. Anoxia Station, announced this month, is similarly driven by the gathering of fossil fuels, and similarly shaped by questions of worker death and morale, but it takes you deep underground - into a sumptuous, brutal world of quartz crystals, salt caves, magma lakes, moonmilk rivers, swirling gases and, judging from the below trailer, enormous maggots and centipedes. Larva lakes, amirite.

It was reported that Pirahna Bytes was looking for a new publisher following job cuts last year. In January, following a period of radio silence and inactivity from the studio, CEO Micahel Rüve addressed reports of an impending closure by stating the company was in a “difficult situation” while expressing optimism about finding a partner by saying, “Don’t write us off yet!”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer-publisher GungHo Online Entertainment has revealed Disney Pixel RPG, an upcoming 8-bit adventure starring Mickey Mouse, Winnie the Pooh, Genie from Aladdin, Baymax from Big Hero 6, and many more beloved characters. It launches in Japan on iOS and Android devices this September, and is expected to be released in other regions of the world at a later date. 
According to the game's website, Disney Pixel RPG will feature a story about merging worlds, fast-paced strategic battles (with simple controls for mobile and even an auto-play function), customization for your own avatar character, and expeditions that allow you to send pixelated Disney characters out on missions to gather materials and more. Players in Japan can pre-register for Disney Pixel RPG right now ahead of the game's September 9 launch – there's no word on if other regions will be able to pre-register anytime soon, however. 
"The game world that these Disney characters call home have suddenly been invaded by strange programs, and are starting to break down," the story description reads on the game's website. "These previously isolated game worlds have merged, throwing all the characters into confusion. Take on the role of a player of these games and join Disney characters as you embark on an epic quest across multiple game worlds to restore order." 
The game's listing on Apple's App Store notes it will be free-to-play but will feature microtransactions. 
Here's a look at the game's combat: 
And here's a look at the game's avatar customization: 
Disney Pixel RPG launches in Japan on iOS and Android on September 9, 2024. There's no word on when to expect it in other regions of the world.

Two days after returning home from my vacation in Japan, Tokyo-based developer Nagai Industries Inc. released a trailer for its upcoming adventure game, InKonbini: One Store. Many Stories, and I was immediately taken back to my convenience store (“konbini” is Japanese for convenience stores, generally) adventures days prior. From Lawson’s excellent spicy chicken to 7-Eleven’s life-altering egg salad sandos, convenience stores in Japan are incredible, as strange as that is to write. InKonbini is a ’90s love letter to the konbinis of Japan, and after speaking with Nagai Industries founder Dima Shen about InKonbini, I couldn’t be more sold.

The genre uses the best elements of traditional filmmaking to amplify what will always be the greatest story ever told: reality. Whether it’s an educational look at the natural world, a gripping true crime tale, or an enlightening biography of a noteworthy figure, the best documentaries manage to educate as effectively as they entertain.
The video games industry is now old enough to have been subjected to its fair share of documentaries, from The King of Kong to Indie Game: The Movie to Netflix’s High Score. But no matter how good they are, they all generate a tough-to-pin-down anxiety in me I never consciously noticed until recently: By the time the film ends, or, more often, in the middle of it, I just want to stop watching and play the…]]></summary>

Who thought hip-hop would take it this far?
As we celebrated the 50th anniversary of hip-hop last year, it’s now a good time to look back at how ingrained hip-hop music is in gaming, from NBA2K (remember that 2K13 soundtrack curated by Jay-Z?), Mortal Kombat, and Need for Speed, to Cyberpunk 2077 and, of course, Fortnite.
Mortal Kombat 11 came out of the gates in 2018 with a fiery trailer featuring music by 21 Savage, and later Megan Thee Stallion live-streamed an MK11 match on Twitch. The lore of Grand Theft Auto continues to grow, powered by recent GTA Online upda…]]></summary>

Just within the character creator, there are hundreds of options to customize things like hair, body type, what your playable character Rook's face looks like, and so much more. There are also a ton of armor options, too. 
Companions have an armor slot, a ring slot, an accessory slot, and a weapon slot, while Rook has access to even more – a helmet, two weapon slots, a belt, an amulet slot, and two ring slots. A belt having its own slot might sound odd as it's not an armor piece people typically think of when kitting out an RPG warrior. However, the belt is an important facet of Rook's kit.

And it’s always satisfying.
The parry mechanic is one of the novel additions of the 2023 remake developed by Capcom. Whenever a bolt or melee attack from an infected villager is about to impact Leon Kennedy, you only need to press a button to deflect with the in-game knife. This action grants an opportunity to follow up with an attack on the spot while simultaneously adding to RE4’s original close-quarter smackdown.
Adapting this to the PlayStation VR2 wasn’t easy. Instead of Leon doing a swift animation with just a button press, you need to grab the knife from your chest, lift it up in the air, and match the incoming attack. I…]]></summary>

The first Monaco released in 2013 at a point when Xbox Live Arcade had hit its stride, and there was a new appetite for the type of creative and unique game that existed below the huge budget triple-A, high-fidelity experience. Those kinds of games vastly outnumber the big-budget experiences we are familiar with today, but in 2013 we were discovering such experiences and marveling at their ingenuity. The competition is stiffer for Monaco 2 as it nears release, but creator Andy Schatz is clearly excited to revisit the criminal gameplay saying, “If Monaco 1 is about cat and mouse, Monaco 2 is about complexity and creativity.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA has announced that it will delist three Battlefield titles from the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 digital storefronts at the end of the month. 
On July 31, the PS3/Xbox 360 versions of Battlefield 3, Battlefield 4, and Battlefield: Hardline, along with their associated DLCs, will be removed from sale. Owners of these games will still be able to play their single-player content, but online support for these titles will end on November 7. The embedded announcement post on X also includes a link to an FAQ to answer additional questions about the sunsetting process. 
https://t.co/2W8dLlGjBM
June 28, 2024
While the digital PS3/Xbox 360 versions of these games are going away, Battlefield 3 will still be available to purchase on PC. The same is true for Battlefield 4 and Hardline, and these two titles will also remain on sale for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The PC/PS4/Xbox One versions will remain unaffected by today’s updates.
It never feels good to see games get removed from sale like this. The reason likely has to do with EA sunsetting online support; it wouldn't be right to continue selling games with popular online modes if that component doesn't work anymore. For those still logging into Battlefield matches on PS3 and 360, you've got a few more months to enjoy the ride.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Stormind Games and publisher Saber Interactive have released a new story trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead showcasing more of this upcoming first-person horror game's silent alien-infested world. And it continues to look like a scary new addition to the A Quiet Place movie universe. 
Though there's still no release date – it's launching sometime this year on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC – this story trailer reveals more about the state of the world in The Road Ahead. It seemingly begins on Day One, when the aliens, which possess incredible hearing that requires people to remain silent to survive, attack Earth. It then jumps ahead to Day 105, with Alex, an asthmatic college student trying to survive the end of the world with her boyfriend Martin, on the hunt for supplies and more. 
Check it out for yourself in the story trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead below: 


As you can see, it seems Alex might be pregnant, which, if you've seen the first A Quiet Place movie, can make trying to remain silent in this world quite difficult. We'll have to wait a little longer to find out how the story of A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead plays out because it launches later this year on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.
