        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Sega Genesis didn’t technically get Valis II. Instead, it got the remake of the first Valis and Valis III. However, between these two games was a title that remained exclusive to the platform, and that was the bizarrely named Syd of Valis. The Japanese title makes more sense. It’s SD Valis, named such because it uses a “super deformed” anime art style, which might be better known in the West as “Chibi.”


Why? Fucked if I know.


Syd of Valis is presumably a play on the whole “SD” thing, but then the game goes on to refer to Yuko, the protagonist, as Syd, while the manual and box cover do not.


So, anyway, that’s a great start. Syd of Valis tells the same story as Valis II, but with smaller characters, essentially. And with a dumber name.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stardew Valley remains among the most beloved indie games of the past decade, and its content updates over the years help maintain its popularity. Developer ConcernedApe fuels the farming fanfare with additions both big and small, and it looks like he's teasing another. 


The newest of these teases is an image of a parrot on top of a blue perch. It's a cute picture, but the bird's demand for money and capital J on the perch implies there's more to it.




Fans noted these features and ascribed them to Jojamart, the supermarket chain that works as Stardew Valley's antagonist. Blue is the company's primary color and is transparently greedy just as this bird seems to be. 


Stardew Valley's farm-hungry community also noted the tropical setting, leading some to speculate that Joja reached Ginger Island. Some assume Jojamart expanded into Ginger Island, so its reach goes beyond Pelican Town. Others speculate that the parrot is an upcoming incentive for players to pursue working with Jojamart.


Whatever the answer is, ConcernedApe is keeping mum about the situation. Whether it's for Stardew Valley's 1.6 updates or screenshots from the upcoming Haunted Chocolatier, any context given is often vague.


It's an effective way to stir up Stardew chatter, as fans get a look into an upcoming project only to have more questions than answers. I'm among them, so I eat these teasers up while coming up with my own wild theories. 


Part of me gets annoyed these teasers have no elaboration, but it also adds to the fun of wondering. Whatever the answer is, a parrot demanding money from players fits right in with all of Stardew Valley's oddities. As for when we'll see the bird, no one knows for now. Stardew Valley version 1.6 doesn't have a release date yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[8-Bit Legit has announced they'll be handling the publishing duties for Project Blue, an NES-style cyberpunk sidescroller by ToggleSwitch/FrankenGraphics that is coming to modern consoles with a physical release on NES.


Writing about new NES games never gets old. Project Blue casts you as Blue, a child trying to escape a research laboratory in Neo Hong Kong. The trailer advertises Perfect Blue as being built from 256 screens, which kind of makes it look like the underappreciated Legacy of the Wizard. In fact, a lot of the game looks like a futuristic Legacy of the Wizard, which I am totally down for. The publisher also says that there will be three difficulty levels that will modify the game’s layout, which is pretty spiffy.




It’s worth noting that you can already grab Project Blue on PC over on Itch. 8-Bit Legit is the publishing arm of Retrotainment Games and Mega Cat Studios, and is just handling publishing on consoles. I know Retrotainment from Garbage Pail Kids, which was a pretty terrific NES release.


I’m always on board for a new NES game. We’ve come a long way from the early days of homebrew titles. Now, we’ve got boutique publishers who handle all the curation and quality control. It’s nice to have the option to play it on modern consoles, but given the option, give me that plastic rectangle and let me slot it into my computer-toaster.


Project Blue is currently available on PC. The console version will be available for pre-order starting on September 29, 2023, and the retail release will follow on October 6, 2023.

That's still a hefty chunk of change, but it's worth it for a gaming CPU that outfights the Core i9 13900K and trades blows with the much more expensive Ryzen 9 7950X3D, coming well ahead in some games and a tiny bit behind in others.

It's no surprise that, after the massive popularity of the Studio Trigger and Netflix anime, CD Projekt would find a way to work the world of Edgerunners more into its digital Night City in Cyberpunk 2077. Heck, we've already seen a few additions, ranging from a special gun to David's signature jacket. With the 2.0 update, though, CD Projekt Red put in a tribute to not just one or two, but several different characters who all made Cyberpunk: Edgerunners what it is.

        <updated>2023-09-22T20:02:48.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[HoYoverse, the company behind several gacha hits, has announced a follow-up to one in Honkai Impact 3rd Part 2. The next step in Honkai Impact 3rd's journey is due to depart in February 2024.


While many in the western world became familiar with HoYoverse / miHoYo through Genshin Impact, Honkai Impact 3rd was the game that came before, and still holds a solid playerbase throughout its seven-year lifespan. This new chapter, Honkai Impact 3rd Part 2, heads to Mars.


Check out the first look below to get a glimpse at what HoYoverse is cooking up for this new chapter:




It seems like Honkai Impact 3rd Part 2 is a direct follow-up to the base Honkai Impact 3rd, but in what manner, I'm not sure. HoYoverse looks to be improving the combat, exploration, and more in Part 2, as well as departing on a new story branch of some kind.


I've played some Genshin and actually really dug Honkai Star Rail, but 3rd has eluded me a bit. Still, that might make this new release of Honkai Impact 3rd a good jumping-on point. Taking some of the popularity drummed up by Genshin Impact and Honkai Star Rail, and then funneling it back into the two games' predecessor, would be a good play to grab some curious folks already intrigued by HoYoverse's world.


A world away


Still, Part 2 isn't the only impending HoYoverse title. Alongside updates to Genshin and Star Rail, the company is also still working on Zenless Zone Zero, a stylish action RPG that's been on my radar for a while.


HoYoverse recently confirmed that Z3 (as I call it in Slack) is coming to consoles, alongside a PC and mobile version. It's unclear when that might be, exactly, but it's a nice addition.


And it's another game to add to the growing roster of HoYoverse titles. Keeping up with them all seems like quite a lot, but if you like the look and charm of these games, it sure seems like you won't be hurting for more of them next year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cozy games have carved a chill little niche for themselves, and you don't get much cozier than the Shire. The home of the Hobbits is the subject of a new game from publisher Private Division and developer Weta Workshop. The two paired up to announce Tales of the Shire: A The Lord of the Rings Game, currently planned for 2024. 


Specific platforms weren't announced, but the official Twitter is live and lists the game for consoles and PC. You can see a quick live-action preview in the teaser trailer.




Pipe-weed dreams


There isn't much in the way of information beyond what little we see in the teaser. Like anything chill and Hobbit-related, the video shows someone putting the finishing touches on some book illustrations. If said book covers another harrowing journey, we're not likely to take any part of that in this quaint entry. The official accounts describe it as a "cozy The Lord of the Rings game set in the Middle-earth universe." 


This all follows last August's news of Private Division and Weta Workshop signing a deal for a new game set in Middle-earth. Weta has worked intimately with J.R.R. Tolkien's world, handling effects for Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings films, among many other projects. Now we'll just have to wait to see exactly how relaxing this take on the material will be once it launches.


Tales of the Shire is just one of the new projects in the works based on The Lord of the Rings. There's also Return to Moria, which will hopefully wipe the taste of Gollum (yuck, sorry) out of everyone's mouths.

It only took just over a week for Unity to make changes to its brand new Runtime Fee policy, but that's exactly what it has done.
Announcing the changes in an open letter published today on the Unity Blog (shared on social media), the revamped model includes some pretty sweeping changes from the initial policy. Unity Create lead Marc Whitten started the letter off with an apology, acknowledging that "We should have spoken with more of you and we should have incorporated more of your feedback" before making last week's announcement.

As part of his "Grab Bag" segment (which includes random things Sakurai feels like sharing with the world), this time he's focusing on collectibles (which he calls "rare belongings"). If you're the type of person who gets easily jealous, you may want to look away.




When Sakurai leads some of these reveals with "only about three of these exist," you know you're about to see some real stuff.

Here's a full list of gaming collectibles Sakurai shows off



A Wii remote that has Sakurai's likeness printed on the back, given to him as a gift by Nintendo "when Miis were first implemented."


A Pit and Palutena figure that was printed as a reference for a float for a Nintendo-related event: only three of them exist in the world


Autographed copies of Mario Anniversary for Wii (signed by Miyamoto)


A signed bit of artwork for Kid Icarus: Uprising, from manga artist Shigeyuki Fukumitsu


An Xbox 360 Elite with Sakura's name engraved on it: he got the plate directly from Microsoft as a gift (and funnily enough it got the Red Ring of Death [RROD])


A SEGA Associate Planner Certificate from the late '80s, awarded by SEGA to Sakurai



The last item is perhaps the most interesting; as Sakurai notes that he was awarded the certificate for coming up with the idea for Active Time Battles (ATB) in the RPG genre, before the ATB mechanic was widely adopted; and before he was part of the industry proper. What a milestone!

No matter how much I play Lies of P, I can’t get over how heavily it borrowed from FromSoftware’s Souls series. I get it. The video game industry is built on trends. In the wake of every big success, there are always a number of followers who try to capitalize on the newfound hunger. But this isn’t Cities: Skylines borrowing the zoning system from SimCity 2000. This isn’t even Final Fantasy using the party system from Dragon Quest.


Lies of P borrows everything from FromSoftware’s titles. Movement, combat, right down to the aesthetic. A brief glance at Lies of P, and you could easily mistake it for Bloodborne. Lies of P is Bloodborne with puppets, and that is such a waste of Neowiz’s obvious talen…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Mortal Kombat 1 on the horizon, we're revisiting the entry that set the series on its current trajectory: 2011's Mortal Kombat (aka MK 9). Join us today on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. Central as we take a bloody journey through the game's genre-defining story campaign. Episodes will be uploaded to our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel the following Saturday morning. 
After 2006's Mortal Kombat: Armageddon seemingly concluded the franchise's main narrative, 2011's entry picked up the bloody pieces. It moved the saga forward by resetting the timeline, serving as a soft reboot that brought Mortal Kombat back to its 2D fighting roots and ushering in the return of the classic roster. MK 9's cinematic story mode served as an epiphany for the series and fighting games as a whole, establishing the blueprint for narrative fighting campaigns still utilized today. MK9's story also serves as the first chapter of the modern trilogy of games that Mortal Kombat 1 builds upon. For a whole lot more on MK9 and its development, you can read this feature on how the reboot saved the franchise.
Join editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they battle their way through MK 9 to see how its reimagined tournament holds up.

Under the new structure, the Unity Personal edition will remain free and incur no runtime fee. The new cap before the fee starts has been increased from $100,000 to $200,000, and no game with under $1 million in trailing 12-month revenue will be subject to the fee. Interestingly, the new Runtime Fee will only apply to the next version of Unity that is shipping in 2024. Already shipped and current in-development projects will not be subject to the fee unless they upgrade to the 2024 version of Unity. In the post, Marc Whitten, leader of the Unity Create team apologized for what has transpired in recent weeks.

If you've never played Separate Ways before (it was a side/unlockable mode in the original release and not a paid DLC), it's a gaiden of sorts that deals with what Ada Wong was up to behind the scenes while Leon was out hamming it up and kicking ass. You'll occasionally meet-cute with Leon during the narrative, and deal with old/new enemy types, as well as run through old/new locations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft and Rare have given details on the upcoming Season 10 of their shanty-inspiring game, Sea of Thieves. If you have friends, you might be interested in guilds. If you’re like me and don’t have friends, then the private sessions are going to be more up your alley.


First off, Season 10 is going to introduce guilds into the game. These are organizations for up to 24 players. Within these guilds, players and crews team up to accomplish common goals. Their success will help boost the Guild Reputation, and doing so will unlock new cosmetics for everyone involved. Guilds can be customized with names, branding, and mottos so you can all unite under a single humiliating banner.


Season 10’s addition of private sessions is more geared toward the introvert. Whether you have a tight group of friends or would just rather play alone, the “Safer Seas” mode strips out the PvP involved with other players sailing around. Instead, you can focus on completing Tall Tales or doing some fishing without worrying about distant cannonballs.


However, if you hate people and want to get back at them for existing, then there’s also a competitive addition in Season 10. This comes in the form of a new world event where you attempt to find the Skull of Siren Song. The catch is that any crew that accepts the quest has the same map, leading them to the same spot. Moreover, if you get there first, you’ll only find half of the treasure, which immediately illuminates you with a beacon that everyone can see. So, whoever has that second half is going to be looking for you.


Sea of Thieves is available on PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. Season 10 starts on October 19th.

You get gorgeous looks at outer space, intense shootouts with Spacer Scum, and some good companions to enjoy your adventure with. The game also features a stellar soundtrack courtesy of audio director Mark Lampert and composer Inon Zur.


If you've fallen in love with Starfield's soundtrack, you can enjoy the lo-fi version of it courtesy of Bethesda. The studio released Lofi Girl remixes, giving you the perfect background music when you're sailing across the Settled Systems. 




In typical Bethesda fashion, Starfield features a soundtrack that is grand yet sits neatly in the background as you embark on your adventures. There are plenty of spacey synths and grand orchestras that lend themselves quite well to both space exploration and lo-fi remixes. 


If you're interested, you can listen to Zur and Lampert discuss how they created Starfield's captivating music. They are cleverly able to explain some of their more abstract ideas, such as how the melodies have been composed to form circular patterns. Players who have completed Starfield and headed into New Game+ will understand how this mirrors the game's structure. 


Can't get enough of the soundtrack? You can grab it and the artbook on Microsoft Store.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In January 2022, Microsoft announced its intention to acquire Activision Blizzard for a whopping $68.7 billion. Since then, Microsoft has had to overcome several hurdles to get the deal approved in various regions. The UK has been one of the biggest obstacles, though it appears some important progress has been made. 


A press release from the Competition and Markets Authority reveals that it is pleased with the adjustments Microsoft has made to the deal following prior objections. As previously reported, Microsoft will no longer purchase Activision Blizzard's cloud gaming rights. Instead, they will be sold to Ubisoft. This is being done to stave off any sense of Microsoft's monopolization of cloud gaming.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a week of hints and teasers, Paradox Interactive has finally revealed its new title: Millennia. In Millennia, players will create their own nation in a historical turn-based 4X environment. From there, players will shape the nation across 10,000 years of history starting with the dawn of humanity and stretching into the future. According to Paradox, each playthrough will be unique as you craft an epic story based on your actions. The new strategy title is being developed by C Prompt Games, who doesn't seem to have much of a history. Based on their Steam page, the only previous title by them is a digital board game called Heretic Operative. A teaser trailer was included in the announcement that briefly shows some of the many different Ages you can experience.




Many ages throughout the Millennia


In the trailer alone we see quite a few Ages starting with some rather common periods for the genre. Stone, Bronze, Iron, Kings, and Discovery, are all familiar periods in a historical 4X strategy game. However, near the end of the teaser, we get a glimpse at some rather peculiar Ages such as the Age of Old Ones, Age of Visitors, Age of Archangel, and even Age of Rogue AI. Wait did that say Old Ones? Where do I sign up?


Based on the screenshots on the Millennia Steam page, it looks like gameplay will be similar to the Civilization series and Humankind. The big difference here though appears to be the many different ways your nation can go, as opposed to just vertical technological advances.


I'm a huge fan of Paradox titles, but don't get into Civilization-like games as easily. For comparison, I have almost 400 hours in Stellaris yet only 50 in Civilization VI. As such, I had trouble really getting into Humankind. I'm hoping Millennia does enough different to keep me playing like previous Paradox titles.


Millennia is aiming for a 2024 release on PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zenless Zone Zero, the stylish new game from HoYoVerse (MiHoYo) looks to be releasing on consoles, in addition to PC and mobile devices, as announced at the Tokyo Game Show Special Program. In past looks, the game was only announced for PC, iOS and Android.


Which consoles Zenless Zone Zero will be released for is, unfortunately, still a mystery. But if this game follows in its older sibling Genshin Impact’s footsteps, we can probably expect it to come to PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5. It most certainly could also come to Nintendo Switch, though Genshin Impact has not been made available for that platform as of writing — though it has been confirmed.




The TGS Special Program for Zenless Zone Zero features Yuka Iguchi and Yumi Igarashi, the voice actors behind Koleda and Corin, who discuss the game at length, from its setting as “the last urban civilization,” to “aspects such as the city and character design,” according to HoYoVerse. It’s about nineteen minutes in length, but as of writing, it has yet to be translated into English.


Zenless Zone Zero is, according to the official YouTube channel, a game taking place in “a dangerous world under constant threat from the mysterious calamities known as the "Hollows", where the old civilization has been destroyed and world order lays in ruins.” It’s up to a variety of characters to take a stand and defeat the Hollows, each with their own unique reasons for fighting.

It's also an incredibly cool 2D beat 'em up that is, at its best, comfortably the best I can think of. But the boundaries between the two are too frustrating to make it the legend it ought to be.
It's a sequel to The Friends Of Ringo Ishikawa, a game I didn't really vibe with. FA is much improved, a sort of pared down Yakuza game about beating rival gangsters up in between story bits about an ageing Maruyama trying to get the band back together after leaving prison and apparently not caring that he's dying. I do recommend it, but be prepared for some friction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While the Steam Deck has set the trend for portable PC-style gaming handhelds, there is some stiff competition aiming to make waves. The ASUS ROG Ally released recently and the Lenovo Legion GO is on the horizon. As such, Valve needs to keep ahead of the game, but a new iteration of the Deck may be some time off.


According to a report from The Verge, Valve's own Pierre-Loup Griffais told the publication that he doesn't anticipate a leap in performance that won't compromise on battery life for "the next couple of years."




This suggests that a Steam Deck 2 may not be on the horizon for some time. Indeed, Griffais, speaking to CNBC at the Tokyo Game Show, said the company is looking at a "stable target" over the next two years, suggesting that the team may not be looking to pursue a newer, more advanced model just yet.


How will Valve keep up with the market?


We know that the Half-Life developer is considering a follow-up to its popular Steam Deck device. However, Griffais' words make it seem like there won't be one on the market for the foreseeable future.


A lot can happen in terms of technological leaps in a couple of years. How will Valve hope to retain its position in the mobile gaming world if it's not looking at a new model just yet?


The report from The Verge speculates that a refresh of the Steam Deck could be a possible go-between. With the Nintendo Switch and graphics cards getting refreshed mid-generation, we could see something similar happen to the Deck, but it may not be one with more processing power or better hardware overall.


Of course, that's all just speculation. You never know what can happen in this industry and as competition heats up in the market, Valve will likely be keeping a close eye on how the technology advances.

Not because I love Game Boy Advance games, though that is certainly true. Rather, because I could never wrangle together the peripherals and people needed to make many of the system’s unique multiplayer experiences work. So when I saw this morning that Kirby & The Amazing Mirror would be coming to Nintendo’s subscription service next week, I couldn’t help but smile.


For the uninitiated, Kirby & The Amazing Mirror is a unique curiosity of a game. On one hand, it is as much a Kirby platformer as any. It has all the copy abilities and cute characters you could ask for. But instead of the traditional level-by-level structure, it veers…]]></summary>

Even among Elden Ring’s cast of bastard-hard bosses, the Goddess of Rot distinguishes herself as an ender of lives, a relentless steel tempest that has shredded the most prepared and dextrous of adventurers. She’s also been beaten, rather soundly, by a man using only his mouth.

Or, to be more precise, a QuadStick FPS, a specialised game controller comprised of a mouth-operated joystick and several 'sip and puff' switches. It’s the favoured tool of professional streamer and Guinness World Record holder Rocky "RockyNoHands" Stoutenburgh, who in 2022 used it to become the first quadriplegic Elden Ring player to claim Malenia’s scalp. This was a win for a QuadStick as well: a showcase of how adaptive hardware and clever controller design could make games more accessible than ever, enabling players with disabilities to match and exceed the heroics of their able-bodied peers. And yet, there’s little sense – among disabled players, advocacy groups, or even controller manufacturers – that accessible hardware is entering its golden age. While major breakthroughs have been made, high prices and commercial concerns still carry the threat of willing, eager players being left behind.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The polished-up 2.0 update for Cyberpunk 2077 is out now, ahead of its Phantom Liberty expansion on September 26th. I’ve been trying out both, partly to see if the 2.0 newly raised hardware requirement of SSD storage is a warning worth heeding.


Hard lines against hard drive installations are new to PC games, but it was only a couple of weeks ago when Starfield showed the dangers of crossing them. Broken audio, regular freeze-ups, load times so long you could measure them with a calendar...  an SSD really is the only way to play Starfield, and it sounded like Cyberpunk 2077 would follow suit. "We advise against running the game on an HDD (or on a SD card on Steam Deck) due to lower bandwidth which may cause new content to not stream properly," reads CD Projekt Red’s 2.0 patch notes. That’s us told.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a clear decade since the last entry in this co-op crimeathon FPS series, so I was interested to play Payday 3. Payday is exactly the sort of online multiplayer I can get behind: PvE with clear but theoretically malleable goals (theft!). But although compared to Crime Boss: Rockay City it's a crushing 60st monster truck tyre, Payday 3 isn't really reinventing the Payday 2 wheel. In some respects you might think it's rolling backwards, and while dedicated Payday 2 players may well switch over to the current gen iteration, you get the sense they'll be complaining about things the whole time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It was only a matter of time until people started mashing Starfield up with Skyrim. Combining some of the assets of one Bethesda game with the world of another (or vice versa) was an inevitability. Trust the modding community to come through for us.


If you head over to Nexus Mods, user ndreams has just released a mod for Skyrim that lets you become companions with Starfield's own Sarah Morgan, aka the Chair of Constellation.


Image via ndreams/Nexus Mods.


It looks like a fairly simple change to The Elder Scrolls 5, adding Morgan in as a "vanilla follower" who can be seen wearing a standard miner outfit. Unfortunately, it doesn't say whether or not she still retains any of her dialogue, so we may have to assume that she doesn't.


Where can I find her?


Like with any follower – in Starfield or Skyrim – you'll need to seek Sarah Morgan out before you can have her in your employ. The mod description page says she can be found wandering the streets of Whiterun during the day, or by the Temple of Kynareth at night.


You might need to do some tinkering before you can get her as a follower. For example, ndreams recommends some different textures. Other than that, it should be a pretty straightforward install.


Since Starfield came out just a few weeks ago, we've already seen a ruck of custom mods for the game. And more are coming out all the time. Indeed, there's even been some crossover, such as this one, which is aiming to turn the Bethesda RPG into Star Wars.

We have taken a look at the YouTube channel Macho Nacho Productions a few times on Nintendo Life (remember the world's smallest GameCube and the 'thicc boi SP'?), but we were particularly interested in the channel's latest video, which saw a Switch OLED get converted into a dedicated home console, and run a lot cooler in the process.
In the video (above), Tito from Macho Nacho showcased the TVii Switch Re-Shell Mod (working title), created by a modder called Set. This build converts a standard Switch into a dedicated home console, removing the chance for handheld play, but letting the system run much cooler in the process. The casing even works on Switch consoles without a working display — making handheld play impossible from the get-go.

Developed by Wētā Workshop, the New Zealand-based special effects and props company that worked on Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings movie trilogy, and published by Private Division, Tales of the Shire promises to let players live their best cozy Hobbit life. 
Private Division revealed little about the game with its announcement yesterday, although it did release a teaser trailer that captures the vibes of living on The Shire. Check out the Tales of the Shire teaser trailer for yourself below: 


"Your cosy Hobbit life awaits in Tales of the Shire, a heart-warming new Lord of the Rings game by Wētā Workshop and Private Division," the teaser's YouTube description reads. "Coming 2024." 
And that's all we know about the game. Here's hoping we learn more soon because it sounds like a great premise.

In fact, despite a laundry list's worth of tweaks, fixes, improvements, and implementations, a post on the game's Steam page says that the changes are "way too long to publish."




Having said that, what is listed is worthy of note. From AI enhancements to an overhaul of the perks and skills to even some remixed music from Idris Elba, version 2.0 of Cyberpunk 2077 could well be the ultimate way to experience the game.


CDPR has even said that a new save is highly recommended, given how many changes the game's been through.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[LEGO's Super Mario line is about to add a very hungry desk display piece in the form of a Piranha Plant figure. It may not be to scale, but it's over nine inches tall and priced at $59.99. The set is yours to build and, if you choose, set alight with a fireball on November 6, 2023.


The LEGO Piranha Plant comes in a buildable pipe, which, yeah, I guess all LEGO things are buildable. Its head, mouth, stalk, and leaves are all posable. You'll finally be able to capture that perfect "Mario's about to get eaten alive" pose right on your shelf. Listed for builders 18 and older, the set is made up of 540 pieces.

After-hours flowers


That's right, this is an adults only Piranha Plant. Like The Mighty Bowser set before it, the Piranha Plant is marketed to all the grown-ups out there who need more Mario foes on their shelves. I am absolutely including myself in that demographic. For my money, they nailed the look of this one, at least more so than Bowser. You might think it's hard to mess up a Piranha Plant, but you'd be surprised. 


One thing this set is missing is any kind of digital play functions. It can't interact with any of the other Super Mario LEGO sets, but it looks fine enough on its own. The best part is the fairly reasonable price. It would be hard to top the wallet-busting Bowser and NES LEGO sets, priced at $269.99 and $229.99, respectively. This is one plant I may actually be able to keep alive for longer than a week.

One month later, the CMA has granted preliminary approval to Microsoft due to its new Ubisoft deal. 
The CMA says it has "identified limited residual concerns with the new deal" but that Microsoft has put forward remedies (see: Ubisoft's role) that the CMA "has provisionally concluded should address these issues." The CMA is now consulting on those remedies before making a final official decision ahead of the October 18 deadline to do so.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Although a decade old, Final Fantasy XIV remains one of the best live-service games/MMORPGs to jump into. Its sprawling narrative and fascinating world were big draws to players like me, and now fans will can experience the world again from a new perspective.


In commemorating FFXIV's 10th anniversary, Square Enix is adapting the game into a tabletop RPG. Many popular games make their way to the tabletop format and FFXIV is not a bad pick to adapt.


Based on the announcement and teaser website, FFXIV TTRPG operates something like Dungeons & Dragons. Anywhere from 3-5 players work as adventurers in Eorzea to complete quests and go on TTRPG hijinks. Also like D&D, a gamemaster manages sessions and controls the general pacing assuming the players don't hijack the session.


A starter set is all that's available, but for $60 it comes with guidebooks for players and gamemasters along with some accessories like a map and character tokens. There are also multiple scenarios pre-planned by the FFXIV development team to give players/gamemasters an introduction to its structure. It's not a bad deal assuming everything included is high-quality.


I love FFXIV and D&D, so this package is tailor-made for me. Potentially remaking my Miqo'te as a tabletop character is an awesome prospect and already a big sell for me.


Anyone who wants to pick up FFXIV TTRPG has to wait until May 2024 for it to come out. Pre-orders are available on Square Enix's website, and the wait gives me enough time to pester my friends into trying out FFXIV.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pick a card, any card.
These days, Monolith Soft is well known for being one of Nintendo’s finest internal teams, with the Xenoblade Chronicles games delivering some of the finest open-world JRPG goodness available. Long before the company was acquired by Nintendo, however, some of the first projects it produced were the two Baten Kaitos games, both of which were originally created to address the lack of RPGs on the GameCube. Unfortunately, neither title sold very well, but they’ve now been given a second lease on life on modern hardware with Baten Kaitos I & II HD Remaster. Though neither of these games prove to be exceptional, they’re still enjoyable refreshes of an interesting phase in Monolith’s past and stand as welcome additions to the Switch's enormous RPG library.
The narratives of both games here — Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean (2003) and Origins (2006) — are related, though just isolated enough that you can play either release first without feeling like you’re missing out too much on important context. Baten Kaitos follows a somewhat unlikeable protagonist named Kalas, a self-interested sellsword who is hellbent on getting revenge for the deaths of his brother and grandpa. Early on in this quest, however, he inadvertently releases an old seal placed on the God of Destruction, Malpercio, kicking off a race to get to the other seals before the evil Alfard Empire can use them to fully unleash chaos across the world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We won't be getting a Sonic Mania sequel just yet, but we can expect a classic Sonic experience this year thanks to Sonic Superstars. We already know that the game will feature 2D side-scrolling, though it has ditched the pixel art style of Sonic Mania. Jun Senoue will be handling the soundtrack with some help from Tee Lopes. 




As the release date draws nearer, Sega has been dropping quite a few teasers, including a music track reveal. The latest tease comes in the form of a gorgeous animated short movie serving as the prequel to Sonic Superstars. You'll be familiar with this colorful animation style if you've played Sonic games released in the past few years such as Sonic Origins.

Sonic's troublesome trio


The short movie, titled Trio of Trouble, starts with Fang the Hunter up against Sonic, Tails, Amy, and Knuckles. Fortunately, Sonic and his friends outsmart Fang. 


Fang isn't the only villain around, however. Dr. Eggman also makes an appearance and we get to see more of Trip, who is a new foe. As the prior reveal illustrated, Trip is dressed in metal armor, and she is quite clumsy and prone to setting off booby traps. 


Working together, Fang and Trip subdue a slippery serpent, but that isn't quite what Dr. Eggman had in mind. Though they seem like a ragtag group of villains tripping over themselves, it does seem like they'll pose a significant challenge.


You can play Sonic Superstars when it launches on October 17 on Nintendo Switch, PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S.

Wētā Workshop and Private Division have announced Tales of the Shire, a "heart-warming" experience that will release on PC in 2024. I've got a live action trailer for you, in which a young person doodles pictures of Hobbits, while seated at a desk intriguingly strewn with modern appliances such as laptops and assorted Lord of the Rings paraphernalia. The book she's doodling in contains sketches of celebrated locations such as the Green Dragon pub in Bywater, and there are drawings of dolls, Hobbit-holes and onions. Take a peek!

Over at the Tokyo Game Show this week, Japanese hardware firm Tassei Denki has been showing off some hardware prototypes that could potentially give us a glimpse into the near future. One of these is of particular interest to us and appears to be a new concept for the Nintendo 3DS.
The two units on display are powered by Ryzen and are presumably emulating 3DS titles for the purposes of the demonstration. They both boast 6-inch screens with a 1080p AMOLED display and are capable of running games at 90Hz.

The CMA blocked the deal in April this year over concerns that it would "alter the future of the fast-growing cloud gaming market", and might lead "to reduced innovation and less choice for UK gamers over the years to come". Microsoft attempted to woo the regulator by agreeing to sell Activision Blizzard game cloud streaming rights to Ubisoft, and while the CMA have "limited residual concerns", they've largely accepted Microsoft's modifications.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Resident Evil fans have been waiting for Resident Evil 4 Remake's VR mode, and at this year's Tokyo Game Show, we saw a bit more of what's in store. The free VR mode, which will be released on PS VR2, will allow you to experience Leon Kennedy's tale in the most immersive way possible. 




As we learned from the latest trailer, the mode will feature realistic gunplay. You can experience this in Resident Evil Village's VR mode where guns need to be physically reloaded and cocked back before you can fire, raising the tension in the game's most frightening moments. The ability to throw knives is also back. 


Care has been taken to ensure a smooth VR experience. Hence you'll be able to break crates holding loot with a single button press. You'll also get to enjoy immersive 3D audio, allowing you to sense which direction foes are coming at you from.

Resident Evil 4 VR mode questions remain


Though we've learned a lot about the upcoming VR mode, there is still a lot that is left unanswered. There's been no word yet on whether the DLC will support VR but if it's anything like Resident Evil Village, it'll be an exclusively main story feature. 


There's also no certainty of whether you'll be able to transfer your progress from the regular mode to the VR mode. Village did not have this feature which doesn't give much hope that we'll get it this time around. 


You can expect the game in Winter this year. Until then there's the action-packed Separate Ways DLC to indulge in.

While it hasn't been officially announced for Switch (or, indeed, any specific platform at the moment), we're getting ourselves all excited about Tales of the Shire, an upcoming "heart-warming" Lord of the Rings game from Wētā Workshop and Private Division, due out on "consoles" in 2024.
Now, we don't actually know all that much about this one for the moment — the above teaser is more of a title reveal than anything else — though the following description from the Tales of the Shire website has us thinking that this might not be quite as action-packed as many of the LotR games that we have seen in the past:

Alas, it comes too late for the Wood Elf Druid I rolled during my first try at the 1.0 version. I wanted her to look like a sort of Kung Fu Galadriel, with cool tattoos and aerodynamic scars, but she emerged from the character creator looking like she'd been mugged by a packet of demon crayons. I've left my active character, a High Elf Sorceress, safely tattoo-less.

Development on Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak officially wrapped some time ago, and now it seems Capcom is gearing up for a big 20th anniversary, which will take place in March 2024.

Immediately I remembered the feelings I had when playing the original Dragon's Dogma over a decade ago. I remember exploring the huge open world and scaling colossal beasts for the first time in an attempt to spam attack their head and drop them quickly. For the most part, Dragon's Dogma 2 looks like an enhanced modern version of Dragon's Dogma. And to be honest, that's exactly what I want. Here's the full nine-minute deep dive in its entirety:

Thankfully, they shared relief while looking at how well both games have held up over the past two decades.


The original Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean launched on GameCube in Japan and the west in 2003 and 2004, respectively.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Nintendo Family Computer (more commonly known as the Famicom) launched in 1983 in Japan, a full two years before its Western analog, the NES, debuted in North America. This was right as the video game market underwent a temporary implosion in other parts of the world and was strangely the best time possible for Nintendo to break into the home market. 


Collecting for a Japanese console can cause some hesitation for an Anglophone. The fear is that the best games will remain in their native language, and you’ll be left with piles of RPGs where you can't even navigate the menus. That can certainly be a problem as you get into later generations of consoles, but with the Famicom, there are a lot of great games that don’t require much reading comprehension.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[French gaming accessory distributor Nacon opened preorders for its Revolution 5 Pro controller for PS5, PS4, and PC. The officially licensed, polished-looking product is listed at €229, or $245, approximately half the cost of a new PlayStation 5. But if you can’t stand stick drift, maybe that’s a small price to pay.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[But there's no stopping Pikmin 4.
It's time to cover the weekly Japanese charts once again. The latest figures from Famitsu (via Gematsu) have come in, and the Switch is back to filling out all spots in the top ten.
Pikmin 4 is incredibly still at number one, selling another steady 23,489 units in the week of 11th to 17th September. It's now just shy of shifting 850,000 physical copies in Japan alone. Pokémon Scarlet & Violet — a mainstay in the JP charts since its release last year — has jumped up a few places to third, shifting 9,319 units, likely due to the release of the first half of the Expansion pass, The Teal Mask.

That love has only been amplified by having a kid whose first instinct in any game is to create his own character, unit, level - whatever is available.

The best creative games inspire that creativity by having some innate flavour of their own, though. Some personality that inspires you to lean in, or nudge it in some other direction. By comparison, the new trailer for Everywhere, seems like metaversal porridge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Octopath Traveler II is one of the year’s most celebrated RPGs, and now Xbox fans have been invited to join the party. The game is coming to Microsoft’s consoles and Windows PC early next year.
The RPG was first released to PlayStation consoles, Switch, and PC in February. Octopath Traveler II, like its predecessor, sees players guide eight adventurers across a sprawling adventure in an HD-2D rendered world. Though similar on the surface, the sequel has been praised for its improvements in storytelling, character development, progression, and navigation. 
In our review, we scored Octopath Traveler II an 8.5 out of 10, with guest writer Josh Broadwell writing that “Octopath Traveler II does what an excellent sequel should. Instead of breaking new ground left and right, it improves on the original in nearly every way and feels more confident about the stories it tells.”]]></summary>

Tomb Raider developer Crystal Dynamics is the latest subsidiary of Embracer Group to be hit with cuts, with the studio announcing yesterday on Twitter that ten staff had to be let go "due to an internal restructuring".
And, at Embracer's annual general meeting (which you can watch on YouTube), CEO Lars Wingefors has stated that the company will need to "continue making tough decisions" in order for the company to become "more cost-efficient" (thanks, Game Developer). Wingefors reiterated that these cuts were projected back in June, and is "confident to deliver on the targets we set out for the end of the fiscal year," which means the cuts will continue until at least March 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin's Creed Nexus VR hits Meta Quest devices in less than two months on November 16. This release date was revealed in a new gameplay trailer from IGN for Assassin's Creed Nexus VR, which gives us another look at the game's three protagonist assassins: Ezio from Assassin's Creed II, Connor from Assassin's Creed III, and Kassandra from Assassin's Creed Odyssey. 
In the trailer, we get a look at how combat and parkour will work in the game. As expected, given the game is a VR exclusive title, everything happens from a first-person perspective. As Connor, players will explore 18th Century America during the American Revolution. As Ezio, players will parkour through 15th Century Italy during the Italian Renaissance, and as Kassandra, players will fight as a mercenary assassin through ancient Greece. 
Check out the Assassin's Creed Nexus VR gameplay trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Assassin's Creed Nexus VR looks pretty much exactly as you'd expect for an Assassin's Creed game in VR. All the assassin tropes are still there, fortunately, like leaps of faith, hidden blades, parkour, and more. 
Assassin's Creed Nexus VR hits Meta Quest devices on November 16. 
While waiting for its release, check out this Assassin's Creed Nexus VR trailer from June and then read our preview after checking out more of the game earlier this summer.

At this year's annual Tokyo Game Awards, which are held during the Tokyo Game Show, the Family Computer — known as the Famicom or NES (to us) — won the Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry Award (thanks VGC).
That's a rather long title for an award that recognises someone or something that has contributed significantly to the growth of the Japanese games industry. The official website says that "Rather than just being a hit toy, it laid the foundation for the world's game industry, which has continued to develop for 40 years up to the present day", and that the video games industry would not be where it is today without the Famicom. For reference, FromSoftware president Hidetaka Miyazaki won the award in 2022.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baldur's Gate 3 is one of the biggest games of the year, but it launched with its fair share of bugs. Luckily, developer Larian Studios has released two major patches to the game, and while the third was set to release today, it's been delayed to tomorrow. In a post on X, the site formerly known as Twitter, the developers announced the patch would be delayed "to ensure thorough testing." This is likely done to avoid the issue they ran into when they had to roll back a hotfix last month.
While we know the patch has been delayed, before now we didn't have much of an idea of what that patch included. While specific bug fixes are still unknown, Larian tweeted about a new feature to expect tomorrow: the ability to change your character's appearance. This includes details like pronouns, voice actor, and specific facial features, but notably does not allow you to change your race, which could alter the story depending on your choice. 
With Patch 3 comes the Magic Mirror, which lives in your camp and allows you to change your Tav’s appearance whenever you’d like!

Even though the patch plans have been derailed, Baldur's Gate 3 still launches on Mac today, so if you've been meaning to grab it on that platform, now's the chance to do so. We'd highly recommend it, and you can read about why in our glowing review of the game. If you've been playing the game and enjoying it, maybe it's a sign you should try D&D, the game it's based on, as well.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MythFarce.
With its bright, cel-shaded models and notably more tame environments, MythForce targets nostalgia for Saturday Morning cartoons from the 1980s like He-Man and Thundercats. A lot of people don't remember just how poorly a lot of those cartoons hold up, though. They have their die-hard fans, and they're fun to look back at with your tongue in your cheek and a drink in your hand as you muse about how easily entertained you were as a kid, but for most they're not much worth revisiting outside of a good laugh about reused animation and some occasionally fun character designs. Similarly, even beyond its horrendous performance on Switch, MythForce proves to be an uncompelling experience that hardly holds up.
MythForce is a first-person roguelite dungeon crawler intended (though perhaps not designed) to be played in online co-op. For all intents and purposes, it's a pretty standard multiplayer roguelite; the entire game resets itself after you lose a run, and aside from incremental upgrades, nothing you pick up will stay with you in between runs. You can choose from one of MythForce's four members, each with their own special abilities, for each run.

Capcom has announced that Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney Trilogy will be launching on Nintendo Switch on January 25th, 2024.
The collection contains Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney, Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Dual Destinies, and Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Spirit of Justice, all of which are playable on the Nintendo 3DS. However, since the unfortunate closure of the 3DS eShop earlier this year, a collection on Switch sure sounds like the perfect remedy, right?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week we wrote some articles about the hilariously comprehensive Microsoft leaks, and Alice0 wrote one in particular about Bethesda's plans to not remaster Morrowind. It is, she points out, understandable why the sanitised Bethesda of today would leave well enough alone: "2002's Elder Scrolls game is an overambitious, odd, scrappy, and spiky beast. It is a game happy to leave you lost, confused, misunderstanding, weirded-out, frustrated, and stuck."
Yet, Morrowind is loved! And in the comments of that article Nic Rueben mentioned the demo for Ardenfall, an RPG with no release date but a Steam demo. So off I toddled to have a look, and though I haven't played much of it yet, I'm confident in saying that if you liked Morrowind you should check the demo out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paradox Interactive and new indie team C-Prompt have announced their debut 4X strategy game Millennia, which I got to play for an hour at this year's Gamescom. With development being led by former Irrational Games co-founder Robert Fermier and Age Of Empires II lead designer Ian M Fischer, Millennia will see you attempting that classic quad of Xs across ten distinct historical ages, starting in the Stone Age before eventually ending up in a "post-modern future", designer Ben Friedman tells me. 
The twist here, however, is that you've also got what C-Prompt are calling 'Variant Ages', which let you bend the timeline to your will. Some of these variants are more historical in nature, such as an Age Of Monuments where everyone's building Egyptian pyramids, Friedman explains, while others are more fantastical, with the words steampunk, alchemy and space alien invasions all mentioned in the same sentence. I had a good time with it during my demo, but the real delight was seeing my home army of Kyoto go and invade neighbouring settlement Telford, before going on to conquer Rome - as you do. So if historical melting pots are your kind of 4X jam, read on.

CD Projekt have spent years attempting to address the underlying systemic and workplace issues and claw back some goodwill - hence, the general atmosphere on Xitter of developers needing to take five and stare at a flowerbed for a while.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ahead of Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, which we just learned will be released in January, Ryu Ga Gotoku (RGG) Studio will release Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name. Announced in September, The Man Who Erased His Name stars longtime Yakuza series protagonist Kazuma Kiryu and focuses on his life after Yakuza 6: The Song of Life before he appears in Infinite Wealth. And now, thanks to Xbox's 2023 Tokyo Game Show broadcast, we know we'll be hanging with Kiryu on Xbox Game Pass on the game's November 9 launch day.
The Man Who Erased His Name will also hit Windows PC as part of Xbox's PC Game Pass program on day one as well. 
Alongside this news, RGG Studio revealed that Like A Dragon: Ishin!, a Yakuza spin-off entry that hit PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3 in 2013 in Japan (but never came to the West), will hit Game Pass later this year on both Xbox and Windows PC. 
While waiting for these games to hit Game Pass, read Game Informer's Like A Dragon: Ishin! review and then check out the latest Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth trailer. After that, read our hands-on preview of Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ellis Tucci grew up playing games like Thief, System Shock, and Deus Ex. Now she's making an immersive sim of her own. It's called Spectra, and it's set in the US in an alt-history 1972 where Soviet Union is the dominant military power after President Roosevelt was deposed in a fascist coup. You play as a Soviet agent tasked with infiltrating and fomenting revolution in a fortress city called Hiwatha.
Tucci wants Spectra to meet the criteria players will expect from an immersive sim. "To me, the immersive sim is the platonic ideal of the video game" she says. "I've tried to deliver on that immersion by creating an environment that is extremely interactable and flexible in the ways it can be used." She explains that "a quite frankly silly proportion of the buildings in each map are enterable and that "you can turn off the lights, set traps, and use things like televisions, radios, or payphones as lures."


It sounds like everything immersive sim fans want. But there's one big difference between Spectra and the games that inspired it. Tucci is making it on her own. And she isn't the only indie developer working in one of the most ambitious, developmentally complex genres in the industry. Games like Shadows Of Doubt, Fallen Aces and Gloomwood are merely the steam rising from the bubbling magma chamber that is indie immersive sim development, Like the recent revival of retro shooters, the indie space is on the verge of an immersive sim eruption.

There are actual vampires that come back from the dead less often. But I'm piqued nonetheless by Chinese Room studio design director Alex Skidmore’s thoughts on how this Seattle-set World of Darkness action-RPG adaptation will differentiate itself from other games in the genre, and especially, how it will put its vampiric premise to use.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Baldur's Gate 3 "no possibility left unpossible" choice-and-consequence train continues with the revelation that, if you break up with a lover in the game, you can slowly repair the relationship and spark a bit of your old chemistry. This might not sound earthshattering to anybody from outside the videogame world - what are you doing here? Run along and watch your silly non-interactive movies and TV shows - but it's quite novel for a fantasy RPG in the BioWare tradition. In my experience, at least, most RPGs only give you the build-up to a character romance, then flash-freeze the relationship post-consummation, perhaps because you've unlocked a sexy "loyalty" companion ability and the developers don't want to take it away from you. Baldur's Gate 3 is one of the few that thinks about how chemistry  might come and go.

How Did Rebirth's Development Compare To Remake's? 
Rebirth launches on February 29, a couple of months shy of Remake’s fourth anniversary. According to Hamaguchi, Remake’s development cycle was around four years, making the turnaround for Rebirth, a much larger game, seem relatively quick.

Final Fantasy VII Remake felt like the realization of an impossible dream when it launched in 2020. Not only did it feel willed into existence after years of fan requests, but it largely lived up to sky-high expectations based on its generally positive reception. Tack on a good story expansion with the Yuffie-focused Intermission, and the series is riding a wave of momentum into its second chapter, Rebirth. To learn how the sequel is shaping up, I visited Square Enix’s Los Angeles studio to play two slices of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth: a flashback sequence of the ill-fated Mt.

Among the sicker jokes I've played on various editors as a freelancer is to review triple-A games on this sorrowing technological Igor, which - I swear to you - physically flinches and begins to whimper frantically when presented with any game more demanding than Far Cry 2. Thing is, I'm pretty sure I can run Ubisoft's forthcoming Assassin's Creed: Mirage on this hapless relic. The publisher have released minimum and recommended system specs for their latest historical throat-slitter, and they're pretty dang reasonable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In an announcement I personally never could have predicted, the 2001 PlayStation 2 Capcom video game Onimusha: Warlords (and subsequent sequels) is getting an anime adaption for Netflix. The reveal is surprising for a number of reasons. The franchise is not one that is particularly well-known or currently popular. Also, the anime seems to have little to do with the original game. Protagonist Samanosuke Akechi does not make an appearance in the trailer. But, like Samanosuke, who was modeled after Japanese actor Kaneshiro Takeshi, the anime's protagonist, Miyamoto Musashi, is modeled after the late Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune. Coincidentally, Onimusha 2's protagonist, Jubei Yagyu, was modeled after Japanese actor Yūsaku Matsuda, who had also passed away well before the game released. It's an odd throughline for the series but is a key element.
The other surprise for the adaptation is it is being co-directed by Takashi Miike. Miike is known for films like Ichi The Killer and Audition, but he also has another big Capcom franchise under his directorial belt with Ace Attorney, a film adaption of the Phoenix Wright games.
I played Onimusha for the first time in earnest when it released on Switch and enjoyed revisiting it and finally beating it. You can find more of my thoughts on that topic here.


The anime premieres November 2 on Netflix.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Farming life sims like Stardew Valley remain enduringly popular, and until Stardew dev ConcernedApe's Haunted Chocolatier arrives, there are plenty other games popping up like cute life sim mushrooms to horn in on our shared desire for a simpler, more rustic way of life. The route to this in Stardew Valley is actually quite hard, requiring mastery of several different interlocked systems that each ask a level of expertise that, on most days, I cannot be arsed to work towards. I love Stardew Valley, to be clear, but I hold no expectation of ever getting the most out of the farm space alloted to you as a result of your grandfather's death.
Fae Farm is a Stardewlike with a fantastical veneer and 3D graphics, but importantly it frontloads progress. It's slightly easier, in ways that seem small but cumulatively mean it takes up way less of your brain's runtime on bad days. For example: all activities, including watering your crops, use less energy than in Stardew Valley. This means you can run around clearing farm space and gathering resources, and have a working plot in just a couple of days. Heck, you can have a pretty full day in the mines before you've mechanised your farm. Game changer!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cyberpunk 2077's triumph was that it offered a sprawling story, dozens of hours long, which cohered around just a small number of themes. Or maybe even a single thesis: that the cynical, defensive, self-centred voice in your head - personified by ancient, soul-trapped, anarcho-rockstar Johnny Silverhand - offered only a literal dead-end, and that real rebellion in the face of a messed-up world lay in helping friends. It was Frank Capra with robot arms and samurai swords, and I ate it up.
V doesn't go to Washington in Phantom Liberty, but Washington comes to her. CD Projekt Red's major expansion to the first-person RPG opens up a new district and a new cast of characters, including the President of the New United States and an aging sleeper spy played by Idris Elba. The themes remain the same, but the thesis is being tested: how can you help your friends if you don't know who they are, and if their goals are mutually exclusive?

Since its disastrous launch in 2020, developer CD Projekt Red has delivered critical updates to Cyberpunk 2077 to align it more closely to the original vision, but Phantom Liberty, coupled with the free Update 2.0, is its biggest yet. This new expansion trades in the high-octane mercenary vibes of Cyberpunk 2077 for a more subdued spy thriller, and offers a well-made trove of new ways to experience Night City. The expansion features a great cast of personalities, all well-performed, even if some are underused. Interacting wi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spencer Yan's My Work Is Not Yet Done is a narrative-driven investigative horror game that combines elements of the survival and simulation genres with a plot exploring "the imbrication and dissolution of human identities/meanings within uncanny wilderness", to quote the project's Github page. It follows the final days of Avery, last surviving member of a doomed hunt for the source of a strange transmission, and sees you performing complex acts of maintenance upon environmental sensors, while picking through journals and other found documents so as to "to discern the most viable 'truth' behind both Avery's mission and the signal itself". 


It's all wrapped up in a dense, warping two-tone aesthetic with shifting naturalistic sounds that makes my breath catch in my chest. I love everything I've seen and heard about Yan's game, but I don't think I've ever done it justice in writing, and I doubt today's efforts will address this. For you see, what I'd like to call your attention to right now is the game's complex recreation of shitting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega and Like a Dragon series developer Ryu Ga Gotoku (RGG) Studio held a presentation this morning sharing all kinds of new details for its upcoming games, Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth and Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name.
First up, it shared a 10-minute story trailer for Infinite Wealth, which shared so many details that I am hesitant to write them all here in fear of spoiling potentially major plot beats in the game. The summary is that Ichiban Kasuga is offered the opportunity to find his mother, which means he must travel to Honolulu, Hawaii. Returning characters make an appearance, Ichiban will apparently be fighting sharks and giant squids, taking part in fun Hawaii activities like surfing, and, expectedly, will be getting into all kinds of trouble with the local gangs. Kazamu Kiryu's role also gets somewhat defined in the trailer.


Some details not in the trailer include the fact that the playable party now has full freedom of movement while fighting, allowing for more strategy. The game includes a Crazy Taxi-inspired minigame, among many other money-making opportunities. Actors Danny Trejo (Machete) and Daniel Dae Kim (Lost) will also be playing Dwight, the leader of the Barracudas gang, and Masataka Ebina, the ruthless captain of the local yakuza syndicate, respectively. You can check out some additional screenshots for the game below.

Alongside the story trailer, there is also a five-minute gameplay trailer.


Arguably, the biggest news from the event, however, is Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth's release date, which isn't far off. The game releases January 26 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, and PC. Preorders for the game will net you the Hero’s Booster Pack, to level up faster, and a Special Job Set that includes the Linebacker and Tennis Ace jobs.
Alongside all the Infinite Wealth details, Sega and RGG also released the full opening cinematic for Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, which you can watch below.]]></summary>

It's "by far the biggest expansion Stardock has ever made", according to company founder Brad Wardell, who claims this latest dollop of interstellar tyranny will "transform the gameplay in ways not seen in a 4X game before". By which he chiefly means that the Supernova Edition uses large language learning models to generate civ backstories on demand. Let's dig in!

        <updated>2023-09-20T12:21:47.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Among the chunkier morsels from yesterday's leak of Microsoft documents is an extended email from Xbox CEO Phil Spencer, dating from 2020, in which he argues that today's largest AAA videogame publishers remain dogged by their "failure" to adapt to the shift from physical to digital videogame distribution, and especially, subscription models such as Microsoft's own Game Pass. This inability to move with the times, Spencer suggests, has created a situation whereby the largest publishers rely on sheer "production scale" to attract and retain customers. 


In turn, this has meant that publishers are unwilling to bet on new IPs - it could be billions down the drain, after all. Instead, "AAA publishers are milking their top franchises but struggling to refill their portfolio of hit franchises", while relying on "rented" IPs such as Star Wars. This is an older email, of course, and there's an obvious element of self-flattery in the shape of Microsoft talking up Game Pass. Still, it's a persuasive account of recent industry history, bolstered by Spencer's notes from conversations with Assassin's Creed outfit Ubisoft and GTA publisher Take-Two Interactive in particular.

Not only is Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth launching on January 24th next year, it's taking Ichiban and co. to the sunny island of Hawaii! Kiryu's back and in a battle with his biggest adversary yet. And you can become an unhinged Pokémon master, among many, many other things. We're so back. We're so effing back.

In a statement posted to X (formerly known as Twitter), Saber explains that despite only releasing the game last May, it’s effectively moving on from it. Saber doesn't give a reason behind the decision, but states that it still plans to fix any major bugs and will keep the servers running “for the foreseeable future.” Check out its full statement below. 
Evil Dead: The Game is an asymmetrical multiplayer game set within the popular film universe where players control Ash and his friends to survive against a player-controlled Kandarian Demon. We weren’t particularly enamored with the title at launch, with video editor Alex Van Aken scoring the game a 6 out of 10, writing in his review, "It’s incredibly one-sided for a game all about two sides. And it’s majorly unbalanced." You can watch a team of editors tackle the game in this episode of New Gameplay Today.]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-09-19T21:44:35.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this morning, various Xbox and Microsoft documents leaked online: emails, in-development plans, internal details, and more. It's how we learned Xbox head Phil Spencer considered acquiring Nintendo and Warner Bros. Games at one point, that Xbox is planning an Xbox Series X/S refresher for next year, that it might be working on remasters of Fallout 3 and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, and that Microsoft has plans for a next-gen hybrid console in 2028. 
The leaks were quite extensive, and after some online confusion, we learned via Bloomberg that Microsoft accidentally provided federal courts with confidential (and not redacted) documents. Following news of these leaks, Spencer has now addressed what’s happened with a brief statement on Twitter. 
We've seen the conversation around old emails and documents. It is hard to see our team's work shared in this way because so much has changed and there's so much to be excited about right now, and in the future. We will share the real plans when we are ready.
September 19, 2023
He shared that on Twitter, but The Verge has obtained a more in-depth memo sent to Xbox employees. Here it is, in full: 
Something of note, especially for those particularly excited about something that might have leaked today, is that in both the internal memo to Xbox employees and the public-facing statement posted to Twitter, Spencer says these leaked documents and email are old and plans have changed. He also says the team will share "the real plans" when ready. Now, he obviously can't say the leaked information is what's happening and must downplay it as a result, but it's also a reminder to take everything that has come to light with a grain of salt because it's very likely plans have changed.

I'm a Soulsavoider, so I'm more interested in the other games coming to Microsoft's Full Convergence stepping stone in the next couple of weeks, including Cocoon and The Lamplighters League.

'Luckily', what appears to be the platform's web portal can be located in seconds.

The past decade of innumerable remasters has been boring enough, but remastering these two games is particularly boring. When even bother when all Bethesda have made since Oblivion is Oblivion remakes with added spacesuits or yelling? Boring. But while I think the torrent of remasters is a miserable sign of big publishers just giving up, if they're going to do it anyway: why not Morrowind?

Scumhead's Franzen - released a few days ago on Steam and Itch - has a couple of big draws, straight off the bat. Firstly and least importantly, it's free, which it really shouldn't be. Secondly and more significantly, it's one of those rare RPG miniatures that is both richly imagined and snappy, with a busy and befuddling world in which you have immediate clear motivations that escalate rapidly and breed Dire Implications. It also looks like a 16-bit Pathologic, so consider me firmly on board.

        <updated>2023-09-19T15:30:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At first glance, Lies Of P looks like a wannabe Bloodborne reskin, replacing the Gothic edges of Yarnham with a twisted version of a kid's fairytale. There are silhouettes in windows sheltering from an infection that's plagued the populace and puppets who've gone awol. Take damage and you've got a chance to recoup the costs by smacking the baddie back. There's a bit where you platform down a large well, thin planks of wood marking your descent. Survive and you might want to visit your doll-like maiden and spend your souls.
But is Lies Of P just another boring pretender to Bloodborne? No! I think it's worked with its Gothic Pinocchio theme remarkably well, and the option to snap and configure your puppet lad to your liking makes its journey feel distinct. Sure, Lies Of P might lack some of the presence of its main inspiration, and not all of its parts come together to form a cohesive whole, but the game is an undeniable must for Soulslikers who crave the dark. It's perhaps the closest any Soulslike has felt to a FromSoft game, in everything from its presentation to the cadence of your character's jog.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I dunno if you've heard of this game Starfield, but there's a lot of talk about it at the moment. It is a roleplaying experience where the role you play is not "Viking-ish warrior who can shout with the power of a million metal frontmen" or "wasteland wanderer downing cans of irradiated coke" but "person in space following a broadly unexciting A-plot". Much of the most interesting stuff in Starfield is on the periphery of the main story, as is the case with most Bethesda RPGs, but I find Starfield to be much less whimsical (something I won't relitigate here). As an RPG, Starfield is taking itself seriously, and sometimes this collides with the design game systems and menus.
An example of this is that you are supposed to experience the vastness of space, but cannot do so without going through a lot of loading screens. Another is that you have two sets of clothes: a spacesuit for places that are hostile and have no breathable atmosphere, and street clothes for planets that do. And NPCs keep making fun of me for wearing my spacesuit when I don't need to, and I hate them for it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overnight, in what Edwin called an "unredacted document oopsie" related to Microsoft trying to buy ActiBlizz, two things have been revealed that interest me. Well, three. Firstly, Phil Spencer capitalises "Gaming", which I hate. Secondly, as noted in that linked story, Phil Spencer wants to buy Nintendo and, in pitying also-ran brackets, Valve, which has some of the same energy as me walking into an estate agent and demanding a six bedroom house with a new fitted kitchen and a hidden library. And thirdly, according to a release schedule from a presentation dated 2020, Bethesda and Zenimax have planned out their next few years of games in depressing MCU presentation-style. Boy, are the next couple of years going to be whelming.
As is predictable now, it is largely a list of sequels and remasters, many of them dated quite optimistically, it must be said. This document pegs Starfield for 2021, for example, and obviously that didn't happen. There are also two unnamed games on there for this year (Projects Kestrel and Platinum; 2021's Project Hibiki we know refers to the surprise-released Hi-Fi Rush) and it seems unlikely they're going to appear before the end of the year. We know The Elder Scrolls 6 isn't coming for at least another five years. They're going to remaster Oblivion (but not Morrowind, the weird cousin everyone else likes most, but whose parents aren't sure what job to give them in 2023). And they're going to make Dishonored 3. I'm excited about that! But also fearful.

And not because its planets are all mostly dull, lifeless husks. It's mainly because wherever I go in the universe, I'm haunted by the fleshy spectre of a misshapen man. I'm not even talking about the adoring fan (though he does also stalk my every step, too). Rather, I'm alluding to my own in-game father, who's randomly generated face and features are so utterly horrifying to me that I do a little sick in my mouth every time I run into him. Who can blame me, honestly, when his mouth is so high it clips right through his goddamn nose?

Hah, the only thing it doesn't let you do is commune with the dead! Actually, there are a few other things it doesn't let you do, but let's stick to the positives for the moment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As you've hopefully read elsewhere on here, there's been an overnight windfall of insider info about Microsoft's long-term gaming biz objectives, thanks to documents accidentally released by the US Federal Trading Commission during its court case against Microsoft's Activision-Blizzard acquisition. We've learned that Microsoft are still rather keen on buying Nintendo (and Valve), and that the company had planned out the release of Dishonored 3, an Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion remaster and a Ghostwire: Tokyo sequel during the run-up to its acquisition of ZeniMax. 


The leaked documents also include extensive internal pitch and presentation materials regarding Microsoft's first-party gaming operations all the way to 2030. We can apparently expect a mid-generation Xbox console refresh, code-named Brooklin, in 2024; more intriguing, from a PC gaming perspective, is the promise of a 2028-bound "hybrid" Xbox platform, which will centre on a "thin client" OS that runs cloud-based games on “< $99”, "consumer or handheld" devices. Oh no, it's the power of the cloud all over again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft and Xbox representatives appeared in court earlier this year to get its $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard legally greenlit. Per usual court proceedings, various emails, documents, and more were sealed away from the public and press, but many unseen documents leaked this morning. It's how we learned Xbox head Phil Spencer considered acquiring Nintendo and Warner Bros. Games at one point, and that Microsoft is planning an Xbox Series X/S refresh with a new controller for next year. Other documents point to potential remasters of Fallout 3 and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, alongside other games. 
More specifically, a "ZeniMax Management Forecast" document details plans for various games, including the aforementioned remasters of Fallout 3 and Oblivion, alongside a potential sequel to 2022’s Ghostwire: Tokyo and a third installment in Arkane's Dishonored series.
You can take a look at the document for yourself below (credit to Game Pass Tracker on Twitter):

September 19, 2023
As you can see, this document mentions other games we know about, like Machine Games' Indiana Jones project, 2021's Deathloop, and the recently released Starfield. 
It also mentions The Elder Scrolls VI, which we just learned will launch no earlier than 2026 and will not launch on Sony's PlayStation 5. 
It's important to note that this leaked document is over three years old, so it's safe to assume plans have changed and that this schedule likely does not represent the company's current plans.
For more, read about how Xbox head Phil Spencer considered acquiring Nintendo and Warner Bros. Games in 2020, and then check out the refreshed Xbox Series X/S and new Xbox controller coming next year, according to internal Microsoft documents. 
Which of these games would you be most excited about? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am in control of the RPS Game Club this month, so therefore I can do whatever I want - and this time I'm delving into the world of Hypnospace Outlaw's music. No other game sounds like Hypnospace. Featuring a veritable mountain of tracks (most of which was composed by the game's creator, Jay Tholen), Hypnospace’s extensive catalogue stretches across genres both real and imaginary. While Seepage’s Nothing Left For Me is a clear pastiche of Linkin Park, Fre3zer’s Icy Girl is a purposefully poor attempt to mimic Coolpunk, a genre built upon remixes of a jingle for a discontinued soda brand. The most exciting thing about Hypnospace is that its soundtrack is so dense and complex that there's opportunity to hyperfocus on one particular area to an intense - even problematic - degree.
Enter The Chowder Man, a stetson wearing Kid Rock analogue who makes frequent appearances throughout Hypnospace. A prominent rock musician in the 80s, Erik Helman (portrayed beautifully by musician, comedian and inventor of the Rick Roll Hot Dad) is attempting a last-ditch revival after his music career flatlined, transforming him from Jagger-esque superstar to sold-out jingle writer. The Chowder Man’s in-game discography is strange and varied, spanning from glorious rock ballads to 22 second earworms about a microwavable butter-based dessert. Totalling ten tracks, I have decided that it is my duty - nay, my fate - to rank and review them in their entirety. So let us commence this spiritual journey together, my friends, into the complex mind of The Chowder Man.

A sizeable helping of the same, if a 2020-dated release schedule leaked as part of today's accidental FTC Microsoft court document blowout is to be believed. The document is from a July 2020 Microsoft presentation about the acquisition of ZeniMax, during the early months of the Covid pandemic - as such, it doesn't reflect Microsoft and ZeniMax's plans today, following global lockdowns and the buyout, and several of the dates are obviously bogus. Still, it's probably a good steer as to current and future Bethesda and ZeniMax projects, which may include Dishonored 3 and remasters of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion and Fallout 3.

The email was sent 6th August 2020 to Microsoft's current chief marketing officer Chris Capossela and commercial chief marketing officer Takeshi Numoto. It begins with Spencer speculating that Nintendo may be receptive to approaches, thanks to one of Microsoft's allies, San Fran investment fund ValueAct, buying up Nintendo stock and so, attempting to steer the company's board towards accepting an acquisition.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With its steadfast love of imploding skulls and disintegrating ribcages, Mortal Kombat has always been the most adolescent of fighting games. Mortal Kombat 1 might be using its conspicuous numeric digit to suggest a reset or rethink of some kind, but in truth it isn't remotely concerned with reinventing its world of misfits. While part of me wishes this surface-level overhaul had been more radical, it's maybe unwise to expect that. For decades this series has embraced its love of brainless ultraviolence and childish storytelling. If Mortal Kombat 1 can be praised for anything, it is unwavering kommitment to the bit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Often when we talk about "hype" surrounding a release, it’s in anticipation of shared cultural euphoria more than that of a great gaming experience. Either way, a great RPG game hits different. Recently, Elden Ring and Baldur's Gate 3 have both been landmarks. Not to mention the enduring sweep of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and the Minesweeper-esque ubiquity of Skyrim. When studios get the RPG right, the end result inspires excitement and devotion in ways that feel utterly unique to the genre.
To this end I chatted to Dragon Age, Baldur’s Gate, and Mass Effect maestro Mark Darrah, some of the folks at Studio ZA/UM, and the minds behind the two definitive tomes on CRPG history: Matt Barton of Dungeons And Desktops, and Felipe Pepe of The CRPG Book. I wanted to ask these genere experts about all things choice and consequence, player freedom, and Baldur’s Gate 3’s phenomenal success. What turns a niche into a phenomenon? What goes into creating a great RPG? And what makes the genre so special to people? Turns out that last one is a big question to ask.

It's part of the surprisingly prosperous genre of "team up to complete some big unwieldy task with multiple moving parts" games, and while it hasn't yet hit the highs of Overcooked or reached the terrible depths of Barotrauma, I think the recently launched Early Access build might be worth your time. Amongst other things, it's trying for a curious blend of jolly party game and macabre theocracy work simulator. And it does have some rather swanky-looking ships.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the weekend, Starfield players began to share reports of a strange paranormal infestation. There are asteroids in the game that, for reasons known only to gods and/or programmers, follow you from orbit to orbit, flying eerily in formation with your ship, and sometimes even accompanying you to a planet's surface. "In one of my weirdest Bethesda glitch experiences, I've got a tiny asteroid that's been following me for the past 30 hours," user ReverendRoo posted on Reddit, triggering an avalanche of comments reminiscent of UFO chasers spotting each other at a NASA open day. "I would catch a glimpse of it from time to time," wrote fattfett. "I tried to approach it but you can't. It stays away. I assumed it had a deeper meaning [toward] the endgame." Some players, like Blackdius, have multiple asteroids in tow. It seems impossible to blow them up. I've dug up a Youtube video below of one such clingy space boulder from a couple of weeks back. As you can see, it's not just a fixed background point like a screen artefact, but seems to move in response to the player's ship. Most peculiar.

"Denuvo is no longer in Paday 3," they announced yesterday, ahead of its release on September 21st.

You can get £30 back on the 2TB size, bringing the price to £94, while the 1TB size offers £20 back, resulting in a final price of £52. (This cashback offer runs until 9th October 2023, for the record; see their site for more info.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is a fantastic game, largely due to the fact that it does such a good job of mimicking the Star Wars cinematic style. Whether it's the rush of stars streaking past a ship going into hyperspace or the distinct hum of a lightsaber, Respawn really went all out to match the aesthetic of one of the world's biggest movie franchises. One of the most important elements in achieving that is through music, and while the Star Wars sound is iconic and well-known, a good video game score has to be more than just an imitation of what came before. The music for Jedi: Survivor was written by Stephen Barton and Gordy Haab, and when I ask them what makes a good video game soundtrack, they answer in unison.

The scientific research paper in question - uploaded in August this year, and brought to my attention by RPS contributor and apparent ant enthusiast Matt Cox - sees researchers Samuel J. Lymbery, Bruce L. Webber and Raphael K. Didham use Age of Empires 2 to study how human shaping of the environment affects the balance of power between the indigenous Australian "meat ant", or Iridomyrmex purpureus, and the Argentine ant, or Linepithema humile, who are one of the world's more invasive ant species.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the things I like best about Die Gute Fabrik's forthcoming Saltsea Chronicles is an optional feature. It's a card game, Spoils, which you can play while sojourning upon the game's islands and searching for clues about your ship's missing captain, Maja. Here's how it works: two teams of two characters take turns to play cards, moving in clockwise around a table. Players must follow the lead player's suit, and the highest-scoring card wins the trick, with four tricks comprising a round. It might sound like a straightforward competition, but different islands offer different house rules, and there are twists that reflect the game's ethic of community, mutual respect and diversity, and help animate the detail of its gently post-apocalyptic oceanic world. 
The winning card from each trick is handed to the loser, so victory is, in its way, an act of generosity. Score more than 100 points in a round, meanwhile, and the "Hoarding" rule means you must relinquish those points to the other team. As Die Gute Fabrik's CEO and creative lead Hannah Nicklin observes, this fits the anti-capitalist politics and mythology of Saltsea, in which "hoarding is sort of seen as the apocryphal cause of the flood". The Spoils tutorial menus riff on this with a cute but mildly unsettling image of a sinking ship.

With two fantastic Spider-Man games under Insomniac’s belt, Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 feels like the culmination of the 2018 game and 2020’s Miles Morales in all the best ways. At a recent preview event, I spent roughly 90 minutes swinging and gliding across its new and improved New York City, taking down scores of bad guys and even challenging the Lizard. When my session concluded, I walked away thinking one thing: The first two games swung so that this third act could soar. 
This preview contains spoilers for Spider-Man (2018) and Spider-Man: Miles Morales.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Friends, I am excited. A new trailer for Final Fantasy VII Rebirth dropped last night during the Playstation State Of Play stream, and holy cow, despite feeling a bit ill and exhausted and generally not firing on all cylinders at the moment, I think I might be more pumped for this than literally any other video game on the horizon right now. Even that long-awaited PC release of Final Fantasy 16 can't quite compare to this, if you ask me, and I might even be more enthused by it than the prospect of a Switch 2. And I don't even really like Final Fantasy VII! That's how much Nomura's mad, timey-wimey game child has sunk its teeth into me. I'm mostly here just to see what mad nonsense comes Cloud's way next - and from the looks of things, it's a lot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A big shout out to indie games that are successors to existing games in all but name. It's gotta be one of my favourite trends. Fed up of waiting for a big publisher to revive a series that’s been lying dormant for decades? Simply do it yourself instead. 11 years after the release of Jet Set Radio Future, and with Sega seemingly unwilling to exhume their cult-favourite rollerblading series outside of weird crossovers with Ubisoft’s Roller Champions of all things, Team Reptile have done exactly that.
Enter Bomb Rush Cyberfunk, as authentic a sequel to Jet Set Radio as you can get. Dripping with style and oozing cool, the team have crafted a carefully observed love letter that both respects and advances the original duology in meaningful ways, while taking a step back in others.

More specifically, the year 861 is when protagonist Basim Ibn Is'haq's journey begins in this city, the technological and cultural epicenter of the region at the time. After playing more than two hours of Assassin's Creed Mirage in developer Ubisoft Bordeaux's France-based office, I was impressed with its take on Baghdad. 
I love the open-world RPGs of the series' recent years, especially Assassin's Creed Origins and Odyssey, but I’d be lying if I said I was a fan of their respective cities. It's not that I didn't enjoy them, but they weren't memorable in the same way Assassin's Creed II’s Florence or Assassin's Creed Unity's Paris was. And that's because these cities were inserted into gigantic map…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[US author and artist Bill Willingham has rather dramatically announced that he is placing the Fables comicbook property in the public domain, including all Fables spin-offs and characters. This means that - pending a judgement from third-party legal experts, anyway - anyone can now create art of any kind set in the Fables universe. "What was once wholly owned by Bill Willingham is now owned by everyone, for all time," the author wrote on his Substack. "It's done, and as most experts will tell you, once done it cannot be undone. Take-backs are neither contemplated nor possible."


You might recognise Fables as the universe in which Telltale's The Wolf Among Us is set. It's a grubby noir fairytale world in which bedtime story characters like Snow White and Prince Charming live discreetly among regular humans, aka Mundies, having been driven from their homelands by a mysterious Adversary. I confess I've not read any of the original comics - I've only ever played the Telltale adaptation, which I enjoyed. I feel guilty about that in hindsight, because Willingham seems to have a pretty dim view of Telltale's work, though that's partly to do with what he considers to be his longstanding unfair treatment by Fables publisher DC Comics.

In November 2021, they launched the double whammy of rhythm runner Hextech Mayhem and turn-based RPG Ruined King, and this year alone we've already had action RPG The Mageseeker and narrative platformer Conv/rgence. As you can probably tell, they're all focused on different genres, different League heroes, and have all come from different developers - and soon they'll be joined by Song Of Nunu, the next game from Rime developers Tequila Works. 
I got to play a very small slice of it at Gamescom last month, and yep, if you've been craving another low stakes adventure that's all but guaranteed to wrench at your heartstrings and wibble your tear ducts, Song Of Nunu will almost certainly fill that Rime-shaped hole in your life when it comes to PC on November 1st.

Alongside news of Rebirth's release date, Square Enix and PlayStation also released a new and expansive trailer during today's State of Play.

There is a new fast-travel system
There are over 65 suits to unlock and wear

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, during Sony's recent State of Play livestream, we got a look at both the upcoming PSVR2 update and story DLC for the Resident Evil 4 Remake. 
The VR trailer is brief but does show the game in action. Much like the other VR port of RE4, the move brings the whole game into virtual reality. The big news is that the update is coming this winter.


More immediately, we finally got confirmation that "Separate Ways" is coming to RE4. For the uninitiated, Separate Ways was a side campaign starring, you guessed it, Ada Wong, initially released with the PlayStation 2 and all subsequent versions of the original Resident Evil 4. Separate Ways will be released next week, on September 21.
Moreover, Both Ada Wong and Albert Wesker will be made available as playable characters in the Mercenaries game mode.
For more Resident Evil 4 Remake, check out our review.
Correction: An earlier version of this story mistakenly identified "Separate Ways" as "Assignment Ada." We regret the error.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bennett Foddy, the developer behind Getting Over It, released another trailer for Baby Steps during today's PlayStation State of Play. Foddy, along with fellow developers Gabe Cuzzillo and Maxi Boch, are bringing Baby Steps to PlayStation 5 next summer. 
Today's trailer stopped short of revealing a more exact release date, though. Baby Steps was revealed during a June PlayStation State of Play earlier this year. In it, players control Nate, an "unemployed failson with nothing going for him until one day, he discovers a power he never knew he had: putting one foot in front of the other." And as you might expect, players will control Nate on his journey to discover more of the world around him.

Baby Steps will hit PlayStation 5 and PC during the summer of 2024.]]></summary>

Ascendant founder and CEO Bret Robbins released a statement on Twitter today, explaining the large reduction in staff. He says it was a painfully difficult decision but a necessary one following the release of Immortals of Aveum on August 22. Here’s Robbins’ statement in full:

The hearts of the Game Informer staff are with everyone affected by these layoffs and those still at the studio. 
These layoffs follow the release of Immortals of Aveum, a game we thoroughly enjoyed, on August 22. Before its launch, we went hands-on with Immortals of Aveum at Ascendant Studios and talked with the team about creating a new first-person shooter in Unreal Engine 5.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another Code: Two Memories, or Trace Memory as it's known in North America, is a Nintendo DS game that launched on the handheld device way back in 2005. Its sequel, Another Code: R – Journey Into Lost Memories, launched on the Wii in 2009, but it never came to North America. Now, players can experience both games when Another Code: Recollection hits Switch in January. 
Another Code: Recollection is an enhanced collection of Trace Memory and Another Code: R launching on Switch on January 19, 2024. During today's Nintendo Direct, Nintendo revealed this collection of games with a new trailer showing enhanced visuals while pulling back the curtains on protagonist Ashley, who is traveling to the remote Blood Edward Island in search of her father. 
Check out the Another Code: Recollection reveal trailer for yourself below: 


After Ashley receives a letter from her father, who she believes to be dead, a chain of mysteries and visions from the past is set off, sending her to Blood Edward Island. There, Ashley must investigate her surroundings while solving puzzles to reveal the truth. Another Code: R completes Ashley's tale. In it, she journeys to Lake Juliet two years after the events of Trace Memory to uncover the hidden truth surrounding her mother. 
"This collection includes fully enhanced versions of both original games, featuring overhauled visuals, fully explorable environments, new voice acting, puzzles, music, and more," Nintendo's description of the game reads. "Optional hint and navigation systems have been added to help players new to adventure games." 
Another Code: Recollection will cost $59.99 and launch on Switch on January 19, 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dave the Diver has been one of the sleeper hits of the very busy year of video games that 2023 has been so far and continues to be. Dave the Diver hit PC earlier this year but now, developer Mintrocket has revealed the sushi restaurant management game will hit Switch next month. 
More specifically, Dave the Diver will launch on Switch on October 26, and it will do so with Switch-exclusive bonuses, but only for those who preorder.


The game will cost $19.99 on Switch and you can preorder it on the Nintendo eShop right now. You can also check out a demo of the game on Switch right now, too. Preordering the game before its release will get you a bonus skin for Dave's boat and an exclusive lamp decoration for the sushi restaurant. Mintrocket describes the boat skin as nostalgic and themed after an 8-bit visual style, whereas the lamp depicts Dave "in [a] charming retro style." 
"We're over the moon seeing and hearing the reception to our first game," Dave the Diver game director Jaeho Hwang writes in a press release. "Bringing this to the Switch community has been an important goal for us as we think the console is a home where the players will truly appreciate everything Dave the Diver has to offer." 
For the uninitiated, Dave the Diver tasks players with diving underwater to gather ingredients by day that are used to serve hungry customers at a seaside sushi restaurant at night. However, there's a mystery bubbling up from "the deepest depths of the Blue Hole, the setting that [Dave] will swim through in this incredible journey." 
Dave the Diver is currently available on PC. It hits Switch on October 26. 
While waiting for its Switch release, read Game Informer's Dave the Diver review.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Robotality and publisher Chucklefish have announced that Wargroove 2 will be released next month. More specifically, the sequel hits Switch and PC on October 5, just a few months shy of the first Wargroove's fourth anniversary. 
Chucklefish announced the Wargroove 2 release date during today's Nintendo Direct alongside a new trailer showing more of the game's beautiful pixel art and challenging turn-based combat. It also highlighted the new commanders to control, a new playable faction in Wargroove 2, and the sequel's three interweaving campaigns. 
Check out the Wargroove 2 release date trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, this new trailer reveals the Faahri Republic, which Chucklefish describes as "a nation of curious mouse-folk who have landed in Aurania on a scholarly expedition."
"What the Faahri Republic lacks in military experience, they more than make up for with academic theory," a press release reads. "Equipped with mysterious crystal technology, Commanders Lytra, Pistil, and Rhomb must work together in pursuit of information for their mysterious benefactors." 
Elsewhere in the press release, Chucklefish says Wargroove 2 features new recruits and veteran wardogs to control alongside the game's new commanders. You can supercharge those commanders with a newly updated Groove system, too. Once you're done with Wargroove 2's three campaign arcs, you can battle with or against friends in co-op and multiplayer modes, both locally and online, with up to three other players. 

Preorders for Wargroove 2 are now live on PC and Switch. On Steam and Nintendo Europe and North American eShops, you can preorder for 20% off today. The game's full price is $19.99.
Wargroove 2 hits Switch and PC next month on October 5.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vanillaware released 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim in 2020, and it was a bit of a sleeper hit. However, this team is also behind other games like Dragon's Crown and Odin Sphere. Now, Vanillaware has announced Unicorn Overlord, a new tactical fantasy RPG, and it launches March 8 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4 as a digital-only game, and Switch.
During today's Nintendo Direct, the team announced this new game with a trailer showcasing its various characters, unique art style, and tactics gameplay. And perhaps unsurprisingly, it looks great. 
Check out the Unicorn Overlord reveal trailer for yourself below: 


Vanillaware says Unicorn Overlord combines overworld exploration with an innovative battle system that's very reminiscent of Vanillaware's combat style. In the game, you'll "traverse the vibrant world, cultivate a grand army with over 60 uniquely designed characters, and grow your renown throughout the five nations in this unique epic fantasy experience." 
In addition to a Standard Edition of Unicorn Overlord, Vanillaware will also release a Collector's Edition that includes a physical copy of the game, a premium box, a 16-bit BGM soundtrack CD that consists of two discs with 10 tracks on each, a 132-page artbook, and an original card game for Unicorn Overlord that includes 239 cards, tokens, and markers. The Collector's Edition also includes the "Atlus x Vanillaware Heraldry pack and preorder DLC, which lets you customize the Liberation Army’s flag with emblem designs from Odin Sphere, Dragon's Crown, and 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim." 
Unicorn Overlord launches on March 8, 2024, on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4 (digital only), and Switch.

Ultimate roster. 
All five Amiibo look great, as Nintendo has especially become great at making these figures compared to the first few runs of Amiibo. Nintendo announced that the Zelda and Ganondorf Amiibo for Tears of the Kingdom were coming back in June, and now we know exactly when: both hit stores on November 3. While the two figures were announced together, each will be sold individually. Each Amiibo unlocks a special fabric for your paraglider in Tears of the Kingdom and special materials and weapons for the game. 
The Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Noah and Mio Amiibo go live on January 19, 2024. These two will be released as a single set. The Noah Amiibo gets you Consul N’s Armor for Noah in-game and the Leisure Time outfits for Noah, Lanz, and Eunie. The Mio Amiibo unlocks Consul M’s Armor for Mio and Leisure Time outfits for Mio, Sena, and Taion. 
And finally, the Kingdom Hearts Sora Amiibo for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate will join the figure lineup sometime in 2024. 
While waiting to get each, read Game Informer's review of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and then read Game Informer's review of Xenoblade Chronicles 3. After that, watch the Kingdom Hearts IV reveal trailer.

The terrible beauty of that generator-based exploration and scavenging loop. That moment when you walk just a little too quickly down a corridor, and hear the awful rummaging in the walls. The agonising discovery that not only is it possible to roam with the lights out, but pretty much required, beyond a certain point. The dense burden of grasping more or less where to go, without knowing how to survive the journey - and above all else, those goddamn rats, always encountered where least convenient. Shoo! Shoo!
It's by far the most oppressive and demanding horror game I've played in recent memory, and it'll get considerably worse with the release of the Halloween update.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On paper, Final Fantasy XIV doesn’t do a very good job of encouraging fishing. FFXIV’s lead director and producer Naoki Yoshida — known as Yoshi P — wanted to create something that was "fun, but relaxing”, and there aren’t a lot of material rewards for the time you put in. You can sell the fish or break them down into other materials, but really the only reason to fish is for the sake of fishing itself. 

And yet today Final Fantasy XIV is home to a close knit fishing community of over 27,000 people. This single shared interest has spun off into many different directions, including fishing as a competitive journey, the process of building a space for the hobby itself, and even a kind of metagame. But the main thread tying these all together is the love for fishing, and the community’s central hub is actually located outside of the game - in a Discord server called Fisherman’s Horizon, lovingly nicknamed Fishcord.

Immediately after conquering the Chimera in Part 2 of the Starfield No-Planet Run, I commandeered a UC Longsword II on the other side of the same system. The Longsword has proven a predator without equal, charging straight through opposing craft even when they've got several levels on me, its unforgiving autocannons forming the dominant bassline of every encounter. Frankly, it's getting repetitive, and while the obvious remedy is to plunge cackling and crying into a star system with an AI threat level in the high double digits, I doubt that will really alter the rhythms of Starfield's ship combat - it'll just mean I have to do some grinding.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I didn't sleep a lot at the weekend and nothing interesting happened during the week (please bear in mind that we recorded this episode of The Electronic Wireless Show podcast before Unity made any announcements) so we decided to look at how Starfield is doing post-launch. Plus, Nate has been playing Baldur's Gate 3 and has thoughts about it, so that's double SEO juice for this episode.
There's double beans metaphors this week, and James talks about the latest Steam Decklike, the Lenovo Legion go, which is like if a portable PC made love to a Switch, kind of. Some fun recommendations this week, too, especially if you like cathedrals.

Anyway, I like a kick, and I like a game that manages to actually be funny, and I have been playing Deathbulge: Battle Of The Bands. You do the math(s).
I actually wrote about Deathbulge in a round up of best demos in a Steam Next Fest back in 2020, at which time I enjoyed the RPG antics of a band entering a cursed Battle Of The Bands competition and finding out that it's a fight to the death. The full thing came out a month ago without my noticing, and got past the endpoint of the demo. It's fun! I'm enjoying the combat, which is both real-time and turn-based, and has some surprisingly deep tactics attached to it. But more importantly, the full Deathbulge game starts in a town where you enter houses by kicking doors in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When the Lenovo Legion Go revealed itself, I was unconvinced by its portability credentials but enticed by the wireless mouse transmogrification of its detachable, Nintendo Switch-like controllers. A sparkling sliver of Swiss Army handheld design, providing a familiar taste of desktop play that the Steam Deck or Asus ROG Ally could never achieve without a USB dock.
Turns out, now that I’ve tried the Legion Go for myself, I was worried about the wrong thing. It’s nowhere near as heavy or cumbersome as it looks, and while the breakaway controls remain an exciting prospect, they also risk introducing an acute pain point. At the very least, the model I tested proved highly vulnerable to lead-handed RPS hardware editors, because I left the building very much with the impression that I’d broken it.

There are tasty treats simmering in the kitchen, like the remake of The 7th Guest and sequels to I Expect You To Die and Arizona Sunshine, but right now all the fine dining is happening on Quest and PSVR2, covering which would involve running my thumb under RPS' hermetic PC seal.


In my desperation, I've turned to golf, something I would never consider under normal circumstances. I feel about golf the same way I feel about the UK Conservative party, insofar as both occupy space that would be better filled with trees. But I haven't gone totally tartan slacks. We're only entering the realm of minigolf, which I am more positively inclined toward. It lacks the pretensions and exclusionary nature of its bigger, paunchier cousin. Anybody can rock up to a minigolf course with a putter and nobody will sneer at you for being shit at it. It's also small and inherently naff, traits I can likewise relate to.

The company will only make developers pay extra for the first installation of a game on a new device - so no fees for reinstallations, in theory, and no prospect of spiteful players "install bombing" games to drive up costs for their creators. However, the company haven't stated how or indeed, if they can distinguish legitimate from illegitimate installations in advance, seemingly because their method for tracking installations is based on "estimates" using a proprietary data-gathering system, which they aren't able to discuss in depth.

Since Lars Sundström, aka lman, joined our team as the iOS porter, we have made significant progress. Thus, you no longer need to compile ScummVM yourself in order to add it to your iOS or iPadOS device. 
If you want to help by testing this version, just follow this Testflight link and enroll yourself in the test program. This may require installing Apple’s Testflight app. You can find instructions on how to install games and how to play them on our documentation portal.
We truly appreciate your feedback. You can share your thoughts with the Testflight feedback feature, where you can attach screenshots and post detailed descriptions. Alternatively, you can use our bugtracker, e-mail us at ios@scummvm.org, or post on our Discord Server. Your help will let us eventually add ScummVM to the App Store.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following our announcement about affiliation with ZOOM-Platform, we would like to give a note that they have just started to offer the Macintosh versions of  Syberia 1 and Syberia 2 bundled with ScummVM.
This is important because ScummVM currently supports only the Macintosh versions of these games. These versions were produced by Tetraedge and are built on a completely different engine than the original Windows versions; basically, they are reimplementations, not ports. Now, thanks to the folks from ZOOM-Platform, you can easily obtain these game variants.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are pleased to announce an affiliate partnership with ZOOM-Platform, a supplier of DRM-free games. If you use a link from this website (or from our Wiki), the ScummVM project will receive a small amount of money to be used for web hosting and other expenses.
Any purchases from ZOOM-Platform qualify, but we especially encourage you to check out games supported by ScummVM, such as the Syberia 1, 2, Galador,  Obsidian as well as 18 titles from the Living Books series. In total, we counted 25 games supported by ScummVM, and this list is growing.
We will keep an up-to-date list of the games available from this platform on our Wiki and have added an affiliate link on the sidebar here.
