Echoes can help you navigate the world around you, attack monsters you encounter in the wilds of Hyrule, and access secret areas. There are many of them around, and you’ll encounter a lot before you even escape the castle.

There are two types of Echoes in EoW: those that will help you navigate the world and those that can be used to help in battles. Despite their differing uses, all Echoes are unlocked in the same way.

It gives you something fun to look forward to throughout the year. Some of these events are an annual tradition, while others haven't appeared in ages. Let's rank the items received from these holiday events, shall we?


Valentine's Day


The Valentine's Day event was held for the first and last time in 2014, making this a simple ranking. There's just one item!



Box of chocolate strawberries (2014)



The box of chocolate strawberries was a cool reward, but it was removed from the game a while ago to prevent the creation of a discontinued tradeable item, much like party hats in the original RuneScape.

Speaking as both a news editor and a former paperboy, who broke his mind and body hauling obese Sunday editions to the millionaire houses at the top of the valley, Paperboy is my role model. Or he would be if my role model weren't actually Steven Spielberg's Freakazoid. Paperboy's heyday has long since passed into history, however, and the business of journalism has changed beyond recognition. People don't read newspapers anymore, they just eat pizza. This, at least, is the condensed analysis offered by Food Boy, which launched this week on Steam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For whatever reason, if you want to uninstall Valorant from your PC, it’s a bit of a process. Here, we’ll walk you through how to delete Riot’s hero shooter from your computer for good.


How to uninstall Valorant from your PC


To uninstall Valorant from your PC, you must first ensure your Riot Client and Vanguard tray notification programs are closed. They may be running in the background when booting up your PC since they default to being a startup app.


Once that is all done, follow these steps:



Press the Windows Key and i.


Click on Apps.


Find “Riot Vanguard” and uninstall it.


Select “Uninstall” again when told that the app and related info will also be uninstalled.



You will see a message that tells you that the process will uninstall “Riot Vanguard,” and any programs, depending on its functionality, will stop working. 



Select yes.


Next, while still in your Apps & features window, look for Valorant. 


Hit “Uninstall” and wait for the program to finish uninstalling.

Everything Valorant-related should be deleted from your main files, but some will remain in your AppData or ProgramData folders rooted in your PC. 


Depending on whether you originally installed Valorant to be accessible to all users on your PC, there will be multiple “Riot Games” folders in areas of the drive on which your game is downloaded. 


In any case, open up your File Explorer and find the drive on which you installed VALORANT. If you find a folder with “Riot Games” on it, it’s now safe to delete, as you have uninstalled the base components of the launcher and the game.


To make sure, you can also just enter “Riot Games” on the search bar on your window to find any folders with the name. At most, there should only be two folders in this instance unless you have multiple users on your PC.


Once that is all set and done, Valorant and all other components that come with it should be gone from your PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Monopoly GO seasons typically last anywhere from one to three months. During this time, you collect stickers to complete albums, which reward you with dice, cosmetic tokens, and a ton of cash for your landmark upgrades. 


Let's find out what happens to any leftover stickers you have at the end of a season and whether your stars carry over to the next.


What happens to sticker stars when a season ends in Monopoly GO?


What happens to your stars at the end of a Monopoly GO season depends on the season itself. For example, Monopoly Games will convert your stars into dice like the previous Making Music season. However, past seasons like Monopoly Origins turned your stars into vaults for future albums, so it's unknown which route the upcoming Marvel season will go for.


Screenshot by Destructoid


For the Monopoly Games season and album set, any leftover stars you have will convert to dice rolls. Although Scopely didn't specify the exact conversion rate, previous seasons had one star equal one dice roll. Like before, Monopoly Games' maximum conversion is 700 stars, which converted to 750 dice in previous seasons. In other words, if you don't plan to purchase a last-minute vault for extra stickers, you'll at least start the Marvel season with extra dice.


If Monopoly Games' conversion is the same as previous seasons, then this is a solid rate compared to what you get from vaults. With each vault, you can get a maximum of 200, 350, and 500 dice, while the star-to-dice exchange at the season's end can give you far more. On the flip side, you can also get extra stickers by buying vaults, but this comes at the risk of not getting what you need to complete your albums. You can also give sticker stars to friends if they want to take a shot at an expensive vault for extra cards.

You can decide for yourself before signing up, because all back issues of the newsletter are available on this site. If you haven’t signed up, you can only view the first few paragraphs which is maybe the least exciting part. You’ll just have to take my word for it that below those words is a blurb about something I played for the week (often weird, usually retro) and a recap of the best news and all the review for the week.


Also, we’re doing a thing where if you refer a friend using a link that arrives in the newsletter, you get access to our exclusive monthly special edition that arrives on the last Monday of the month. It will include an interview with someone interesting. This month, it’s TheCatamites, the creator of Anthology of the Killer. It’s not your average interview. Learn what desperation drives someone into game development.


I hope to see you there (figuratively). And if you have any feedback on how to make the newsletter better, the comments below are a good place to drop it.

The biggest changes brought by the Helldivers 2 buff patch 1.001.100


To answer that question, I decided to get my boots dirty. No, I didn't cherry-pick what I felt were the most significant changes from the list of patch notes. I dove. I dove hard. Starting last week and through the weekend, I dropped on bug- and bot-infested planets, putting the patch to the test. It was a scientific process. And by that, I mean I squished and dismantled many enemies. It was great.

It’s partly a story about mental health, partly about the absolute horror of not just managing a Sim but actually being one, and partly about seeing how many wanks and cheese sandwiches you can fit into a single morning. Yes, I washed my hands afterward. Ah, but after which?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even though Ubisoft has pushed out a few very interesting games as of late, they've not been hitting their financial targets. In response, the CEO has announced a set of major new changes to how Ubisoft operates, including a grand return to Steam.


Specifically, this information comes from Ubisoft's latest financial target update for the financial year 2024-25. According to the CEO Yves Guillemot, the reasonably well-acclaimed Star Wars Outlaws has had a "softer than expected" release window. There's a variety of reasons as to why this might be the case, but it doesn't seem like Ubisoft's taken kindly to this apparently subpar performance, and so the company is now finally coming back to Steam for day-one flagship releases.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a whole lot of uncertainty in the Destiny 2 community as of late, and for good reason. 2025's content structure is basically yet another humongous revamp, which really could go either way. Thankfully, the Raids and the Dungeons are still on the docket to some extent.


Specifically, Bungie finally chimed in on how Raids and Dungeons will be handled from Frontiers onwards. The good news is that they're not entirely foregoing this content (I feel that'd be suicidal, honestly), but the bad news is that there will be a fair bit less of it. As per Bungie's latest blog post, we can expect one new Raid and one new Dungeon every year, and that's about it. This is, in effect, 50% of Bungie's current endgame content output, though it's not an entirely black-and-white sort of situation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rayman The Board Game is set for launch at the end of this year after smashing its Kickstarter target. The project has currently reached more than five times its minimum target with another 10 days still to go.


It’s more than 10 years since Rayman Legends, the most recent full title in the Rayman series, launched on PC and consoles. While there is no sign of a new video game release, fans of the series, of which there are still many, will be able to get their fill of the platformer later this year, albeit in analog form.


Ubisoft has teamed up with Flyos Games to launch the Rayman The Board Game Kickstarter project. Despite only launching on September 17, the crowdfunded project has amassed more than $200,000 in pledges, smashing its initial target of $37,117. The project is set to run until October 8 so is likely to pick up a lot more backers in the meantime.


The designers describe the game as a race that pits one to four players as they attempt to evade dangers and rescue Teensies throughout the Glade of Dreams. The standard game includes four-player mats, a deck of 54 action cards, and four stunning vinyl player figures as well as a host of tokens and counters.

There is an expansion and several addons, that aren’t sold separately, which take the player count up to six people and include upgraded wooden tokens as well as improved skins for those who like to plus up their board games (who doesn’t?).


The original Rayman series of games were hugely popular platformers and even led to the launch of spin-off titles featuring the game's antagonists, the Rabbids. And while Ubisoft has continued to develop Rabbids games, at least for Switch owners in China, there has been no sign that the developers are planning any new titles in the main series.

Alice B (RPS in peace) dedicated an article series to it back in 2019, summarising it as "a sad, quiet, meditative game about breathing and loneliness and drawing pictures in the stars". Stone's forthcoming Known Mysteries is a ritual of the sun, I guess. Slated for launch on 23rd October, it's the first of several, creatively low-carbon projects that will run off a custom, solar-powered server Stone has set up on her apartment balcony in Calgary, Canada.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The concept of blending unlikely genres continues to take shape in the gaming world, proving that titles don't need to be known for that one thing. In my experience, it's brought out some of the best gameplay, from Dave the Diver's restaurant and fishing mechanics to the Yakuza series' many genre-bending elements. 


I thought I had seen it all until Blue Rider Interactive's Apartment Story threw me for a loop with its combination of Sims-esque and narrative thriller gameplay. Although a somewhat cozy game like The Sims seems unusual for this particular genre, Apartment Story is definitely onto something here, and it certainly had my interest piqued.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Critical Reflex has revealed Denkiworks’ upcoming courier title, Tanuki: Pon’s Summer. It stars one of Japan’s beloved “raccoon” dogs and is coming to Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC.


It’s going to be very difficult to not make juvenile innuendo here, so I’m first going to point you in the direction of this article to help you understand what I’m referring to when I speak of the Tanuki’s substantial endowment.


I’m not sure said tacklebox is going to be alluded to in Tanuki: Pon’s Summer. Instead, you play as the stripèd canid as they go about their business as a bike courier, which must be uncomfortable for them. I feel like I’ve been talking about mail delivery games a lot lately, but I also think that it’s a good profession to center a game around. 




But beyond just thrusting packages toward waiting recipients, you also can take part in other summer activities such as bug catching, plating sushi, karaoke, baseball, and everyone’s favorite summer pastime: sumo. If this game doesn’t end with a fireworks festival, I don’t know what’s real anymore. You can also pull off tricks on your bike. I doubt it will be quite as stylish as Courier Corps, but I also see no reason why you wouldn’t want to do backflips on your bike.


Tanuki: Pon’s Summer is clearly aiming for the cozy descriptor, which I’ve had mixed feelings on. It also promises that you can befriend the locals and “manage your relationships with an intuitive, emoji-based dialogue system!” My snob sensibilities go into overdrive at the word “emoji.” Surely a Tanuki would have other ways to impress the locals.


Tanuki: Pon’s Summer is coming to Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC.

As a collection of imagery, it's powerful stuff. As a game that you can play (with up to three pals) it is very rough, and not just around the edges.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The PlayStation 30th Anniversary Collection looks great. A lot of people seem to think so. And when retro nostalgia collides with rabid console fandom, things tend to sell out quickly. Pre-orders begin at 10:00 a.m. ET (7:00 a.m. PT), with fans able to hop into a virtual queue as early as 9:00 a.m. Here are some steps…

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is war.
Despite the sheer wealth of Worms titles over the years (most of which are, at the very least, decent), most fans would argue that the series reached its peak fairly early with the immaculate Worms Armageddon in 1999. Indeed, it’s quite telling that, of all the possible games to revisit, this is the one that Team17 and Digital Eclipse have decided to spruce up for the Nintendo Switch.
We’re almost certain that those who played the original, extensively or otherwise, will already have an inkling of how this Anniversary Edition turned out. In short, it’s flippin’ great. This is the Worms Armageddon you know and love, with every mode included from the original release alongside a generous selection of documentary features detailing the creation and development of the franchise. If that’s not enough, you also get immediate access to the emulated Game Boy Color release, rounding out a clean, extensive presentation of a turn-based strategy classic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Star Wars Outlaws Steam release is boosting into hyperspace as it will be launching for Valve's platform on November 21. The first story pack also launches on that day and features the suave icon Lando Calrissian. 


Star Wars Outlaws finally heads to Steam


After being exclusive on Ubisoft Connect for a few months, Star Wars Outlaws will finally be available for purchase on many PC gamers' preferred client Steam in November.

This news comes after Ubisoft released a financial targets update report on Wednesday, which said that there was a "softer than expected launch for Star Wars Outlaws" (via Wario64). Assassin's Creed Shadows has also been delayed into February 2025. 


Ubisoft working on title updates for Star Wars Outlaws


In an X post, thanking the fans, Ubisoft has said it's "hard at work creating multiple title updates, which will bring optimization, gameplay polishing and tweaks as well as quality of life changes including adjustments to combat and stealth gameplay."


The silver lining to Star Wars Outlaws hitting Steam late is that PC gamers on that client will enjoy a more refined version of the game than its launch counterpart. 


"While most of the time it’s firing on all cylinders in the immersion department, I’ve had times when enemies who are searching for me will all group up in a random building, shouting about looking for me and how important it is to do so, but for some reason not actually doing so," said our review-in-progress. "I’m talking 5+ enemies all standing inside the same building just standing around shouting about how I’m done for when they find me."

So, trash game. Fortunately, I can finally experience what it’s like to actually enjoy Chrono Trigger - Canadian Studio Riyo Games are making what they describe as a "spiritual successor". It’s called Threads Of Time, it’s "aided by legendary developers and composers from Japan who have helped define Xenoblade Chronicles, the Mana series and more," and it looks beautiful.

It's giving off heavy Unpacking vibes with its relaxing, simplistic gameplay in which you simply need to match the wooden shapes from your inventory to the corresponding item located within the scene.

I'm glad, so here's another. Cold And Afraid is a murder mystery that aims to channel the 1990s with chunky characters and lots of lovely dithering. You play a detective out to stop a serial killer with a grisly pattern who's preying on the young women of an unnamed US city. On top of the obligatory tank controls, it aims to have "consequential dialogue choices" and a "Time Event system where you must meet certain people at specific times to forward different story threads". Ah, forgive me, you're here to see the chunky limbs. Here's a recent trailer that shows 'em.

Looked for new codes! 




Slimes might seem small and easy to kill, but in Slime Slaying Simulator, you're faced with killing so many in a world packed with them that they'll become the bane of your existence. In these vast worlds, fighting slimes is a noble cause for which you're handsomely rewarded. 


While the game's name might make you think of a cheap knock-off Dragon Quest title, this Roblox game is far from it. In Slime Slaying Simulator, you're taught the basics and then are sent out into the world to kill slimes, earn new gear, and unlock new parts of the world so you can conquer the Slime Queen and many more monstrous enemies. You can even hatch friendly slimes to help tackle the bigger enemies and ensure the world is saved from a sticky, gooey end…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developers Visual Concepts continue to fix critical issues in NBA 2K25, and Update 1.5 has been announced for the next-gen version of the game.


The upcoming patch, set to go live later today, on September 26, will be released on Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5. It's also going to be released later on Steam for PC users. Let's take a look at some of the bugs that are being targeted by the upcoming update.


NBA 2K25 Update 1.5 patch notes


Like Update 1.3 and Update 1.4, the new patch doesn't have too many changes. That said, the changes listed on the official Discord do include fixes for some severe issues that users have reported in the recent past.



Fixed a number of user-reported hang/stability issues when playing MyCareer or in the City.


Fixed a hang that some users were reporting when loading into a MyCareer save.


Fixed a user-reported issue that prevented advancement during offseason in MyCareer.


Removed the 1.5x REP bonus that was erroneously attached to certain clothing items in MyCareer.


Resolved an issue in MyTeam that allowed for players to be subbed at ineligible positions.



Image via 2K


With the first two fixes, playing MyCareer should be a lot more stable. There have been incidents where NBA 2K25 had either hung or crashed when players logged in to the City. With the latest update, that issue should no longer exist. Similarly, a few items would often give the wrong REP bonus, which has now been removed as well.


Additionally, the developers have also announced that there will be at least another patch before the start of Season 2, and it will contain more bug fixes and optimization procedures.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tactical RPG Triangle Strategy is headed to Meta Quest, Square Enix announced today. The popular RPG is currently only available on PC and Nintendo Switch, but this Halloween you'll be able to manage the battlefield of Triangle Strategy in full VR on the Meta Quest 2 and Meta Quest 3.




I'm still not really on the VR train, but for those who are, Triangle Strategy could be an actual solid entry onto the platform. Even though it's not necessarily a traditional idea, being able to get a birds-eye view of the grid-like battlefields could be very advantageous with the experience Triangel Strategy offers.


According to Square Enix, the Meta Quest version of Triangle Strategy will utilize 360-degree 3D movement on the playfield and supports the Meta Quest's Passthrough feature which meshes the game environment with real-world surroundings to further the immersion even more.


Triangle Strategy is a deep tactical RPG from the team behind Octopath Traveler and Bravely Default. With its stylish HD pixelated art style, Triangle Strategy could be a solid choice for porting into VR. Eric Van Allen reviewed Triangle Strategy when it was released on Switch back in early 2022, calling it "a perfect blend of strategy and RPG" and stating that despite its faults, "Triangle Strategy is ultimately the tactical RPG I was hoping it would be."


Pre-orders are available now on the Meta Quest 2 and Meta Quest 3 with a 13% discount ahead of Triangle Strategy's Meta Quest release on October 31, 2024.

Well, as you can see in the headline, according to Miyamoto this won't be happening. In a recent Game Watch interview, the Nintendo legend mentioned how the company had "no intention" of expanding its museum to other locations.

Earlier this week, Level-5 lifted the lid on its brand-new Yo-Kai Watch concept 'Holy Horror Mansion' and while this "cross-media project" including a "Ghost Craft RPG" looks quite promising at a glance, it's believed something may be going on behind the scenes.
Some fans of the Japanese company have taken a closer look at the initial "teaser trailer", and are now claiming at least part of it features AI-generated artwork. There are already a lot of threads on social platforms like 'X' going into apparent specifics and are now calling on fellow fans to raise awareness.

        <link href="https://www.destructoid.com/metaphor-refantazio-massive-five-hour-prologue-demo-out-now/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=metaphor-refantazio-massive-five-hour-prologue-demo-out-now"/>
        <updated>2024-09-25T21:11:08.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my most anticipated releases of the year, Metaphor: ReFantazio, is set to release in just over two weeks. Ahead of the upcoming launch, Atlus and SEGA have released a massive roughly five-hour demo that covers the entire prologue of the RPG. The demo is available now for PS4 and PS5 on the PlayStation Store, Xbox Series X|S via the Microsoft Store, and on PC via Steam.




First things first, don't worry. With a five-hour-long demo, surely you aren't going to want to play through those five hours again in about two weeks when the full game releases. Thankfully, your progress from the Prologue Demo will transfer to the full release of the game.


It appears the demo is pretty meaty, featuring the RPG's first four dungeons, seven of the over 40 classes, also known as Archetypes and six of the followers that accompany the Protagonist by joining your party.


If you're unfamiliar with Metaphor, think Shin Megami Tensei or Persona set in a new medieval fantasy world that mirrors the contemporary real world. With beautiful landscapes and stylish anime cutscenes, not to mention the same lengthy expansive story that Atlus fans have come to expect from their RPGs. I don't have the time, but screw it I'll find time for this one.


I normally don't bother with demos unless I'm really on the fence about a game, mostly just due to time constraints. But for Metaphor: ReFantazio where I already know I'm going to get it, AND the demo progress carries over to full launch, this is like an early Christmas.


Those interested in checking out the demo now can do so on your respective platform. Metaphor: ReFantazio is set to launch on October 11.

If you're having trouble completing the Weekly Quest tied to it, here's how to defeat an enemy with a cannonball in LEGO Fortnite.


LEGO Fortnite Defeat an enemy with a cannonball quest guide


For starters, you must unlock the recipe for the cannon by obtaining Blast Powder from pirates or cowboy skeletons. Collect six Planks and three Copper Bars (Dry Valley caves) to craft it, then start making cannonballs. Build ammunition on the crafting bench using two Granite and one Blast Powder. I utilized these materials to set up a cannon in front of Pirate Camp, but there are better ways to do it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mörk Borg is spreading its dark tendrils off the tabletop and onto Steam. Originally released in 2020 by Free League Publishing, Mörk Borg has been the undisputed, award-winning breakout hit from the Old School Renaissance world of game design. The tabletop role-playing game strips back the d20 ruleset to its most deadly and fill the empty space with bright and harrowing death metal-inspired art, equal parts vicious and colorful, like its mechanics. 


On September 24th, indie game designer Morbidware announced that they were working on a new video game inspired by Mörk Borg's world, deadliness, and art design. The game is called Mörk Borg Heresy Supreme. The game is a 2D action sidescroller, and the Steam page makes its dark promises of death with a "Roguelike" tag. From what very little of the game we have seen so far, it resembles its peers like Blasphemous and Corpse Keeper.

Mörk Borg Heresy Supreme vows not to forget its OSR roots, featuring RPG elements in the form of stats and rolled skill checks. As the Steam page threatens, "You should always put your life in the hands of a die roll. That's why it's called a die roll." In many ways, the game promises a mix of gory gorgeousness and the knowledge that you will churn through many, many characters before you finally reach the end of its pitch-black apocalypse. 


Mordbidware's previous game was The Textorcist, an exorcism-based bullet hell typing game, which only makes this partnership with Mörk Borg make more sense as I say it. Mörk Borg Heresy Supreme announced a Kickstarter to fund this new digital vision of their surreal hellscape. The Kickstarter goes live on October 1, and the game is said to be released in late 2025.


The tabletop game advises you to burn your book; I suppose now we should burn our PCs too. I just hope they've kept the femur club.

Where to find Souffle ingredients in Disney Dreamlight Valley


In order to make a Souffle in Disney Dreamlight Valley, you'll need the following ingredients:



Eggs


Milk


Butter


Cheese



All four of these items can be bought from Chez Remy. You'll need to complete Remy's quests in the Ratatouille realm inside the castle.

He needs to join your valley and then establish his restaurant to get access to the ingredients necessary. Once that is done, it will cost a total of 820 Star Coins. You can earn those by selling crops like Pumpkins, Blueberries, and other dishes you can make at Goofy's Stalls. 


Once you've gathered all of the ingredients, go to a stove at Chez Remy or your house and throw in the Cheese, Milk, Eggs, and Butter into the pan. You'll soon have a Souffle to either eat for 2,386 Energy or sell for 1,230 Star Coins. Valley residents may ask for the dish as well at the restaurant, adding a significant boost to their friendship level. Now you know how to make a Souffle in Disney Dreamlight Valley!


Other Dishes with Eggs


If you want to make some more eggcellent meals, Disney Dreamlight Valley certainly has you covered. Bell Pepper Puffs, for example, are a quick three-star dish that is made up of Red Pepper, Egg, and Cheese. Buñuelos are also an easy four-star meal that is formed from Wheat, Cheese, Milk, and an Egg. If you're up for fishing, you can also create a Wonton Soup with Shrimp, Egg, Wheat, and Onion. All of these can get you quite a few Star Coins.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The latest Slayer's Corp update for Anime Vanguards added a handful of cool new items, including the Fortune Catalyst (Slayer) item. However, you'll need to know exactly how to get your hands on it as it doesn't use the previous Gold or Gems currency. Here is how to get the Fortune Catalyst in Anime Vanguards and what you can do with it.

How to get the Fortune Catalyst


You can get the Fortune Catalyst (Slayer) item in Anime Vangurds buy purchasing it from the new Raid Shop NPC, Renguko, located in the Raid Wing from the main hub. You will need to purchase the Fortune Catalyst for either 400 Red Webs, which is easily farmable, or by spending 199 Robux. If you need more Red Webs, you can get them by completing the new Spider Forest raid that was introduced in the 0.5 update.


In total you can purchase up to 999 of the Fortune Catalyst item, as it is a consumable that only lasts a limited time. To buy more than one, simply revisit the Renguko NPC and buy them.


What does the Fortune Catalyst (Slayer) do?


The Fortune Catalyst item currently in Anime Vanguards will increase the chance of acquiring the secret exclusive Renguko unit when completing the final act of the Spider Forest raid. By default, you have a 1% chance of getting Renguko every time you complete the stage. If you consume a Fortune Catalyst item it will double that to a 2% chance. This may seem minor, but think about it this way: if on average it will take you 100 completions to get Renguko, but you can cut that down to 50 completions, isn't it worthwhile?


The only negative is that each time you consume your Fortune Catalyst, it is used up, and only lasts for one completion. Therefore, you will need quite a lot of Red Webs if you want to effectively farm out Renguko using Fortune Catalysts every time.

Caesar King, SOC's defensive leader, has already made waves in the Signal Search, but the second Agent has yet to make her debut. Here's when to expect Burnice White to release in Zenless Zone Zero.


When does Burnice White come out in Zenless Zone Zero?


Based on the Version 1.2 Special Program, Burnice White will be released on Oct. 16, 2024, during the second half of the ZZZ update launch. If you tune into the new Tour de Inferno Chapter, you'll get a sneak peek of her energetic personality and explosive abilities. However, you must progress through the main story, requiring a Senior Proxy Inter-Knot Reputation.

As an S-Rank Agent, Burnice White possesses a Fire ability and an Anomaly role. She also has a signature W-Engine, Flamemaker Shaker, which is perfect for her Anomaly class. Use it with her build to unlock White's Exclusive Skin effect, changing her appearance in a unique way.


Burnice offers a variety of perks to utilize, like her Core Passive Nitro-Fuel Cocktail and Mixed Flame Blend attack. Thanks to her fire skills, you'll inflict significant damage from her flammable Sorched effect. Earn enough Energy to unlock her EX Special Attack, Intense Heat Stirring Method. With this, you'll unleash a ton of Fire DMG using her robust flamethrowers.


Be sure to equip Burnice White with the rest of the Sons of Calydon, providing extra boosts for faction ensembles. There are a few members to choose from, such as Caesar King, Piper Wheel, and Lucy. Lighter, another SOC member, should also arrive soon, giving you more options for Burnice White's build in Zenless Zone Zero.

Nonetheless, you can get creative with male model outfits and still reach the top spot on a round's pedestal if your clothes fit the theme.


How to swap to male and female body types in Dress to Impress


You can switch between male and female model types using the mannequins in the Dress to Impress dressing room. Once you spawn in, turn toward the area next to the VIP room to find two statues on the back wall. Using a gender mannequin resets your character, so make sure you do this early in the round so you have time to dress yourself up.

Once you use a male or female mannequin, you'll take on the body type shown in the preview and reset your character. Doing this also removes any makeup, clothes, and hairstyles you have on, restricting you to masculine-styled options. In short, you won't be able to wear any dresses or have flowing long hair as a boy in Dress to Impress.


Admittedly, there are fewer options for male characters than for females. Most of the male-specific outfits also have fits for girls, giving you the freedom to use a more androgynous if you want to keep a feminine body shape. Otherwise, swapping over gives you a noticeably larger body shape and height and more defined muscles that can help make certain outfits stand out more.


Despite these restrictions, guys have their unique hairstyles and masculine facial features that females can't use, which can help spice things up a bit. They also get six-pack abs, which is always a fun bonus. There's no right or wrong answer when it comes to Dress to Impress, especially with how open-ended most themes are.

AI is, for better or worse, one of the hot topics of 2024. It's bloomin' everywhere at the moment. Naturally, there's a lot of speculation on whether major video game companies will implement the technology into their work (and many, it seems, already have), but Nintendo fans will no doubt be delighted to hear that the Japanese firm may be steering its ship in a completely different direction.
In fact, famed creator Shigeru Miyamoto pretty much said as much during a recent interview with The New York Times (thanks, IGN).

Nintendo's marketing campaign for The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is in full swing ahead of the game's launch this week on 26th September 2024.

Oh, and beds solve all problems.
Okay, in all seriousness, as the first brand-new top-down Zelda since 2015’s Tri Force Heroes, Echoes of Wisdom is a near-perfect marriage of the old and the new. As with many of Nintendo’s best titles, this adventure completely understands the magic of play, the wonder of curiosity. This time, however, that essence has been distilled into a tiny, top-down experience, complete with that beautiful minfigure look from Grezzo's Link’s Awakening remake, and the developer is back to make magic yet again with the franchise.

President Javier Tebas has just informed the Europa Forum that LaLiga will file criminal complaints against Google in Spain, France, Brazil, and Ecuador.

Mortal Kombat 1's 'Khaos Reigns' update is finally here, adding in fresh story elements and characters. There's also a batch of free content to cover, so let's dive right into it.
The game's 'Year 2' expansion is the biggie here, with fighters Cyrax, Sektor, Noob Saibot, Ghostface, T-1000, and Conan the Barbarian all available for those with the DLC. On the free side of things, we have new arenas, arena variants and 'Animalities' — those creepy animal-based takedowns from the '90s.

If you aren't, let me explain: Zachtronics are or were a US-based video game developer founded in 2000 by Zach Barth, who put the studio on ice in 2022 and now works at Coincidence Games, a "flexible business framework" involving many former Zachtronics devs. Zachtronics have thrown together all kinds of things - Infiniminer, a block-builder from 2009, is probably the single greatest individual influence on Minecraft, while Eliza is a tremendous visual novel about AI chatbots and labour politics. But if there's a type of game they're known for, it's engineering puzzles and factory games.

I reviewed it way back when and thought its Burtonesque setting and story were top notch, but it felt a bit reliant on samey fights. Moonhood Studios, founded by the creators of LIR, just announced The Midnight Walk at last night's PlayStation State Of Play showcase. And it looks to continue their appreciation of the dark and the strange. Case in point: it's a first-person adventure where you play as The Burnt One, who must steer a hideous pot creature through a twisted universe.

Open world samurai action game Ghost Of Tsushima is getting a follow-up called Ghost Of Yotei, developers Sucker Punch have announced (or Ghost Of Yōtei, to include the technically-correct-but-annoying-to-reproduce-on-UK-keyboards diacritic that I will hereby drop to secure our sanity). It looks very picturesque and, like its predecessor, inspired by the Kurosawa showdowns of old. You can see for yourself in the trailer that acted as the finale of Sony's marketing show.

And Edwin noted that the other would probably be a crossover with Remedy's other big game, Control, featuring secret government agency, the Federal Bureau of Control. He was right, judging by the trailer shown at yesterday's PlayStation Showcase.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the Intel Xeon 6900P "Granite Rapids" launch today the review embargo has now expired. I began with my Intel Granite Rapids Linux benchmarking a few days ago and have initial benchmarks to share for the flagship Xeon 6980P processors paired with MRDIMM 8800MT/s memory. This is just the beginning of a lot of Granite Rapids benchmarks to come on Phoronix. Compared to the existing AMD EPYC competition and prior generation Intel Xeon processors, the Xeon 6900P series performance surpassed my expectations and has debuted as an incredibly strong performer. In some areas of HPC and other workloads, Intel is able to regain leadership performance with Granite Rapids paired with MRDIMMs. In AI workloads where the software is optimized for AMX, the new Xeon 6900P CPUs can showcase staggering leads.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like a samurai poised patiently for an opening in their opponent’s defences, Shogun Showdown understands that focus and finesse are the means to delivering an impactful blow. This rare roguelike distils the genre down to its purest components, all in favour of amplifying its dizzying combat that plays gracefully with the concepts of positioning and patience. Highly refined, stylish and complex, Shogun Showdown is a delight.

It turns out the game they are playing is: a remaster of amazeballs vampire odyssey Legacy Of Kain: Soul Reaver, together with its less amazing but sturdy sequel. Said remaster project was rumoured earlier this year, when Sarafan scouts caught sight of a telltale plaque at San Diego Comic-Con. Consider that rumour strongly trending towards the status of a Real Thing, because Sony are in the habit of publishing Real Things, and they've just (accidentally, I guess) popped a bunch of screens and a trailer with a release date - 10th December 2024 - on the PlayStation website.

It's fun to write about Spiders, because you get to frighten people for a moment, before they realise you're talking about the game development studio, Spiders. They have just released GreedFall 2: The Dying Land into early access. For those who don't remember the first GreedFall, it was a colonial-styled RPG about landing on the magical shores of another continent and getting into scrapes with monsters and frontiersfolk. This time the story is furthering the fantasy Columbian exchange by putting you in the role of a native who's been uprooted against their will and taken to the "old world". The game's release comes against a backdrop of dissatisfaction in the studio. But workers have gained some concessions in talks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For years, a dangerous and charismatic game has evaded the grasp of many designers. Some say it doesn't exist, that no publisher would ever back it. I'm talking about the one city block RPG that Warren Spector has often mentioned. Sure, we've seen a few usual suspects already - Deus Ex Mankind Divided, Disco Elysium, even Else: Heart.Break - they all grimace in the line-up but nothing ever sticks. Now, out of the gloom of indie development, comes another perp ready to have his mugshot taken. Shadows Of Doubt is an open world detective sim that comes perilously close to being our guy. Its clothes, stature, gait, and fingerprints match the description of what Spector often describes. And yet, if you tilt your head, something is just a little off. The game isn't confined to one block. It's not an RPG precisely. And its simulation has plenty of bugs, jank, and unintentional comedy. But after all this time, in the absence of a smoking gun, shouldn't we just put this guy in the slammer and call the case closed? I say yes, let's. Officers! Arrest this game, it's brilliant.

If you really want to showcase your knowledge, though, you may want to mention that dinosaurs may have actually fought with large swords lodged between their teeth. Dinoblade demonstrates this! And no, they haven't discovered swords alongside dinosaur fossils yet because palaeontologists have been unlucky thus far. "Soon", you tell them.

If it's none of these things, I would much rather have a shiny turret on spindly steel legs skitter besides me.
Nomada Studios have, incredibly, thrust their hands into my chest cavity and given me a blood-pumping mechanism. Having spent some time with upcoming action-platformer Neva (the game) and Neva (the dog from the game), I have to admit: I did enjoy petting Neva (the dog).

It’s hard not to be moved by the exaggerated kineticism of it all – the magic-enhanced swordfights, the jumping off cliffs and turning into a flying shadow monster, the ability to drift horses. Yes.

It was the work of Junction Studios led by Warren Spector, best known for being The Deus Ex Guy. No, sadly Mickey could not nano-augment his brush for better target acquisition, nor project laser-guided anti-tank rockets from his podgy white mitts.
And no, Rebrushed doesn't let him do anything of these either. Clearly a missed opportunity. But is it better nonetheless? With an updated look, some added secrets, more moves for Mickey, and controller/M&K support, I'd say longtime Mickey heads will adore this nostalgia trip. For total newcomers like me, I'd say it's a platformer that's certainly charming and clever and wonderfully experimental, but a bit flat in places too.

In addition to blocking 69 domains associated with the service, the court has ordered Google to "immediately uninstall" Magis TV apps from Android devices.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spoilers throughout. TLDR: fun, generous, beautiful animation and cinematography. Worked mostly fine on my PC. I would not have given it the best narrative award if it were up against Gran Turismo 7. 
Writing of the frigid framing of Clockwork Orange’s atrocities, the film critic Pauline Kael asked: “is there anything sadder - and ultimately more repellent - than a clean-minded pornographer?” The lavishly directed and animated universe of God Of War Ragnarok is far from repellent, but it also feels spiritually squeegeed; a world of pulpy violence so chirpy and chaste as to strain belief that the scars that haunt its reformed anti-hero could have ever been inflicted there.

Reported by Bloomberg as a disagreement over attempts to "spin off the video-game division as an independent entity," the details were nonetheless somewhat scant. A  new report from Rebekah Valentine at IGN has since shed some more light on the walkout, which reportedly involved “disagreements over the direction of the Interactive division, chaotic departures, communication breakdowns, and a perceived lack of leadership transparency.” It’s a thorough account of some messy events I recommend reading in full, but here’s a brief rundown.

We've been excited to get our hands on its shears for a while, thanks in part to an excellent demo, and in part due to it being from Sokpop Collective member and Bernband developer Tom van den Boogaart.

Now it has a release date: October 4th.

X Corp. challenged the subpoena, citing the user's anonymous speech rights under the First Amendment. In an order published this week, a district court judge denied X Corps' motion to quash, in theory exposing the alleged leaker's identity to Cognosphere.

I'm currently being sued by Nintendo for making myself a nice soft boiled egg for breakfast on Tuesday, the bright yellow yolk of which was apparently too reminiscent of Pikachu’s ballsack. They’ll likely take everything I have, including my typing keyboard, so this is goodbye from me. With my last digital breath, I only wish to inspire a bit more joy in the world, so I’m demanding everyone in the comments give me cat updates whether or not they own a cat. Just make up some lore for the cat you don’t have and tell me about it. Here's what we're all clicking on this weekend.

You can do that anywhere.”
A QA tester with Zenimax currently on union leave, Mitchell joined the Communications Workers Of America (CWA) as a full-time organiser after she and her colleagues formed what was, at the time, the biggest union in videogames - ZeniMax Workers United. Now she helps the CWA do what they did for her and her colleagues at Zenimax: provide support, training, resources and guidance for workers in the videogame industry who have decided, for whatever reason, that they want to unionise.

The major one is that a lot of its quests exist to create distance between places and plot beats. They are overwritten errands such as bringing people lunch or fetching herbs or carrying letters - dessicated, MMO-ish fare, thrust into a moderately enjoyable action-RPG for the sake of incremental worldbuilding and scale.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few months ago, Minecraft's original console developer 4J Studios showed off a new in-house engine they had created, called the Elements Engine. Now they've announced what game they're making with it. It's called Reforj, and it's an "open-world multiplayer survival sandbox." But it's not aiming to be Minecraft 2, they say.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fifteen months on from its PS5 release, Final Fantasy XVI – that actiony RPG of emo-fringed hack ‘n’ slashing and disquietingly sexy Ralph Ineson characters – is now on PC. Enough time, you’d think, to do a proper job of rejigging it with Windows spanners, especially after Final Fantasy XV’s port got so much stick for its lack of features and performance issues.
FFVXI does make some improvements, adopting a full set of DLSS and FSR upscalers and frame generators, and its mouse and keyboard integration feels generally slicker than XV. Sadly, it’s still no first-rate adaptation, neglecting numerous PC features and giving low-end systems an even deeper kick in the plums. Cutting the quality settings can help, as per the guide down below, but overall performance is so up-and-down than you’ll likely never achieve a perfectly smooth ride.

It’s a turn-based battler with an empire-building component in which you play as several emperors in succession, passing on abilities and knowledge to your heir. In what I consider to be a poetic complementary flourish, you can also pass on save data from the demo to the full game. Look, this is what counts as “poetic” just before lunch on a Thursday.

The developer's next game, Welcome To The Dark Place, is more about hearing. It's an "open-world, auditory text-based adventure" which mostly takes place in pitch blackness.

It's also now got a story expansion, Mask Of Darkness, which came out yesterday.

I then combed through several thousand comments below said video, many of which expressed similar longing for the hypothetical Good Old Days, before those wily feminists invaded the medium, transformed every game into a LGBT+ weeping simulator, and threw all the Real Men into a big hole. I did this because I was searching for one particular comment written by somebody claiming to be Matthew Karch, CEO of Space Marine 2 developers Saber Interactive.

Folk hero or not, Marko certainly has some heroic facial hair: his moustache floweth so bountifully that it can’t be contained in his character portrait. Extremely powerful of him.

The existence of the game was first confirmed by Cal Kestis actor Cameron Monaghan, during an Ocala Comic Con panel. “We’re working on a third and we’re in the process of doing that right now,” said Monaghan, which is about as straightforward an affirmative as one could want. It was also double-confirmed this February, following news of layoffs at EA, via Eurogamer.

It's difficult to write about the new skate. game because if you choose to write skate. with the imposed stylings which skate. publishers Electronic Arts insist, you end up putting a full stop after every instance of skate., which makes your sentences about skate. sound fucking stupid. and. belaboured. with. pauses. Game makers, please stop putting punctuation in your game names.

In your temerity and ignorance, you have cried out unto developers Maxis and publisher EA for another sequential helping of the cuddly/sociopathic neighbourhood-building game - a "sequel", if you will. Know ye not that we live in the time of Disrupted Models? Sequels are archaisms devised by the old gods in their dotage. Let us all join hands and set forth into the sunny uplands of the Connected Cross-Media Cross-Platform Universe.

“We combined your favorite genres into one grotesque piece of software! You're welcome, game journalists,” reads the Steam page for the demo. That is a very polite way to kick me in the head and call me a bitch, LYMBUS.

We've already seen a description for the PC version appear briefly on the PlayStation store (of all places). And earlier this year a snoopy fan of the studio who monitors the backend of Rockstar's launcher found similar game descriptions buried amid metadata. Yesterday, that same practice yielded yet another clue - the game's Steam app number.

With survival achieved, and the introduction's excellently sinister advisor whispering evil Tory ideas, the whole city you built in Frostpunk is now just the headquarters for a sprawling expansion effort, and your rule is no longer absolute. Rather than retread the same "prepare for ultra-Winter" ground, your biggest obstacle will likely be your own people, now formed into shifting political parties, and looking outward with colonial eyes. The result is a complicated, laborious survival citybuilder that's two parts compelling, and one part frustrating for the wrong reasons.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I really wanted to like action adventure The Plucky Squire more than I do now, having given its charming 2D to 3D platforming a proper whirl. Yes, it's lovely to look at. Yes, hopping out of a storybook and making friends with an illustration on a coffee mug is cool. And yes, everyone can have a mildly fun time with its puzzles and fights. But that's the problem: who is everyone? At first I thought, "This game is for young kids and that's fine!", given its relative simplicity. Then I hit some puzzles and thought, "Ain't no kid figuring this out".
Then it hit me. It struggles to balance the fine line between being approachable for tiny tots and layered enough for people who've graduated from "goo goo ga ga" to "oo oo aa aa my back hurts". And that's down to how plucky you're allowed to squire at any given time, because it can be surprisingly limited and, sadly, a bit underwhelming.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You can't travel back to the 1980s. But what if I told you it was possible to gently warp your memories of that time? UFO 50 is a kart of 50 games that once existed for an old computer system, all lovingly restored by a gang of coders. The old console, of course, is a fiction. The LX-I never existed. But it's a fun pseudo-history against which to create a grab bag of small games (some throwaway, others mighty) all designed with a distinct 80s look. It's an exercise in adhering to an aesthetic. Like an oil painter working with a limited range of colours, the developers of this bundle have stuck to a 32-colour equivalent of the Zorn palette. Yet play a little of each game, and you start to sense the smirk of chronos. These games aren't stuck in the past, but they are enjoying a holiday there.

        <link href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-should-redefine-live-service-games-as-the-living-dead"/>
        <updated>2024-09-17T14:37:14.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why is every blockbuster video game now some kind of live service game? Speaking as a clueless idiot, the explanation I find most convincing is that it's an attempt to bridge the gap between the returns publishers want from video games, versus how much we're able or willing to pay upfront. "Triple-A" projects now cost exorbitant sums to develop, partly thanks to wider economic inflation, but also because publishers have spent decades teaching players that every sequel has to be More and Shinier. Premium game prices have not risen in proportion, and investors want growth, as they do.
Live service games sneak around this difficulty by dragging out the time we spend playing them. Whether premium or free-to-play, they seek to install themselves as habits by means of regular, planned updates and additions. This is time that can be monetised by way of a subscription model, time in which other products may be sold to you, like skins and paintjobs, and time that becomes a commodity in itself, "engagement", which can be transmuted and exploited to various end. I'm not sure it's ever been expressed this way in any press release boast about longevity, but the unspoken principle/logical extrapolation seems to be that ideally, a live service game should keep us plugged in and plugging away till we die.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Strange Scaffold’s newly released FPS I Am Your Beast is very fun for quite a few reasons, but chief among them is a deep appreciation for the poetry of good videogame violence. I’m not using the big P word just to throw out an overly worthy comparison to something we might associate with craft or beauty, but as a nod toward the game’s playful application of what I previously called ‘a euphoric splurge of murderous game verbiage’ one morning where I had clearly eaten my wordy Weetabix. The way its hurled knives and curb stomps and inexplicable decapitations flow together have an assonant, almost Suessian quality to them.
But it’s also, well, just a bit like Mad Libs. You play as Harding, a man who’s mythical lethality is established very early on. The showing is there in the moment to moment, but the telling is conveyed through cute tricks like how everyone you meet is so deeply afraid of Harding that they loudly keep track of exactly what weapon he’s holding at all times. The Mad Libs comes in through the fact that you can draw Harding a route between A and B, and it’s a given that multiple heads are going to come unstuck from necks along the way. You’re sort of just casually filling in the verbs that seem the most fun to you in the moment. One of the verbs is ‘hornet’. Hornet is a verb now.

Developers Proletariat, Inc announced plans to yank the servers back in August 2022 in the course of being acquired by Activision Blizzard, bringing an end to many happy hours spent skating on conjured ice ramps and hurling boulders around like bunny rabbits. Yes, I am the kind of wizard who hurls a bunny rabbit, if there are no boulders to spare.
Happily, it transpires that Proletariat have resurrected their creation and handed it over to posterity in the shape of a free standalone Community Version, available on Itch.io.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In theory, vampires and immersive sims go together as naturally as bats and caves. Immersive sims tend to involve a balance of stealth, acrobatics, raw strength and crafty manipulation, and vampires are celebrated for all of these things. Despite this, actual vampire-themed immersive sims are rare. My list starts with Vampire: the Masquerade: Bloodlines... and sort of ends there. In a devastating betrayal, Arkane Austin's Redfall wasn't an immersive sim but an open world co-op shooter (a not very good one). The much-delayed Bloodlines 2 was recently downgraded from immersive sim to RPG by new developers The Chinese Room. Arkane Lyon's Blade adaptation seems promising, but it's a ways off. 


Here to paper over the immersive vamping gap in the market is Byte Barrel's Trust, "a new first-person shooter with immersive sim elements". It takes place in a world where the vampires are hunted for their blood, which has become an everyday human energy source, used for everything from car batteries to streetlights. The irony! I feel like, in the circumstances, the ideal solution would be for humans to let vampires suck their blood in return for vampires letting humans use their blood for electricity, but that wouldn't make for a very thrilling shooter. Anyway, here's the trailer.

You're constantly repairing corroded doors and swapping out busted engine parts with cobbled-together technology. But maybe this tinkering was a little too much.

An update now lets you fiddle the difficulty options a generous amount, say developers Ironwood Studios, making the game easier and bringing crafting needs right down.
Buuut... if you thought the opposite - that the game wasn't hard enough - you can now tick a box that makes hitting yourself with the trunk door kill you stone dead.

It's "a compact and high-density Metroidvania, with a focus on sequence-breaking and playing things out of order". It uses a square aspect display ratio calibrated to give wizened Game Boy enthusiasts the shakes, and is made up of 200 single-screen rooms that "slot into the larger puzzle-box of the world". Also, you play a thorn witch who looks a bit like 1950s Tinkerbell, with a touch of Betty Boop. Here's a trailer.

The latest update for the physics-based open world build-a-car game introduces a mountable theodolite, which lets you stitch together monorail networks you can then ride about on.
If monorails strike you as frivolous, don't worry. It's more of a Shelbyville idea. And in any case, the theodolite also lets you construct networks of pipes, power lines and rail-less tarmac roads - the ready-salted crisp of the road family. It’s a chonky expansion that, in the words of lead developer Ian MacLarty, has only “scratched the surface of where this new system could go”. I am predicting an eventual pivot into either themepark management or factory simulator.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For all the nightmarish enshittification modern life throws at us, we can at least feel warm and fulfilled about the resurgence of demos. Bountifully they await on Steam, like a friendly worker offering you toothpick-skewered cheese chunks at your local supermarket. And, oh, would you look at that: this cheese has some guns in it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[British musician Eddy Grant has prevailed in his copyright infringement lawsuit against Donald Trump and his 2020 campaign team over their infringing use of the iconic track 'Electric Avenue'. After consuming four years of Grant's life, the case turned on a fair use defense; under scrutiny of the court, it effortlessly failed to convince on any of the four factors that combine to indicate a permitted, non-infringing use of a copyright work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In recent years Brazil's telecoms agency has claimed significant success in its mission to prevent pirate set-top boxes from accessing premium content. Whether Anatel  is feeling a little vulnerable, or would simply like some new blocking ideas, is up for debate. However, in roughly ten days' time, hackers will descend on São Paulo for a two-day hackathon. Cash prizes await those who manage to disable pirate IPTV devices to the extent they can no longer communicate with their owners.
