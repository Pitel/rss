        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sure, surviving the frosty tundra of a frozen Earth is rough enough, but what if you add dinosaurs to the mix? Well, that may just be an option when the post-apocalyptic sequel Frostpunk 2 launches in September. Developer 11 bit studios teased mod support for the survival city-builder via Twitter earlier today with a brief video clip.




Mod support would be pretty chill-y


Throughout the video we see a variety of, let's just say, not normal Frostpunk entities including a T-Rex, a dragon, the massive circular roaming base from 11 bit studios' other upcoming title, The Alters, as well as an army of adorable pink creatures from their recently released Creatures of Ava.


Frostpunk 2 already looks to be a quality sequel to the original, putting players in the role of building a prosperous settlement in the Arctic wastes, managing the various factions that reside inside instead of focusing purely on surviving. But the official mod support always has the potential to add a ton of new content as well, once players are able to learn how the modding works and start pushing what can be done with it.


The video teased that we will learn more in just a couple of days on August 28. Popular mod solution mod.io also commented on the tweet asking, "What could it be?👀". With more recent titles adding mod.io support, it's quite possible that's the route that 11 bit studios have taken with integrating mod support into Frostpunk 2. But as the video says, we will find out more on August 28.


I already have a ton of ideas of what types of mods I'd love to see in Frostpunk 2, but dinosaurs and dragons aren't a bad start. Frostpunk 2 is set to release on September 20, 2024, on PC via Steam, Epic Game Store, and GOG as well as on Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5. It will also be a Day One on Game Pass release.

        <updated>2024-08-26T18:37:10.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Twitter user playsegasaturn has posted images from Gamescom displaying a Sega Saturn arcade stick and a prototype wireless Dreamcast controller. These haven’t been officially announced by the company and seem to be in an early state, but they’re a good indication of future plans.


The arcade stick is somewhat similar to the console’s Virtua Stick (it’s displayed next to a Virtua Stick box) while also being evocative of the Sega Astro City control panel. It has 8 buttons and (confusingly) labeled for both Switch and other platforms. There’s a large number of sync options on the dial for xinput, dinput, Switch, Sega Saturn, and so on.


Besides that, there is the wireless Dreamcast controller. It looks to largely be a similar form factor as the standard-issue console controller. However, there are additional face buttons and a different stick and d-pad. Notably, there is no window for a VMU display. However, there is also what looks like the preliminary mold for something that would contain a VMU. Either way, it looks like a very early prototype, and it could change. I don’t know why it would have such a large face without the VMU window, so I imagine it just isn’t implemented yet.


Neither device has yet received Sega’s approval, so things may change to meet their vision. Retro-bit has previously released replica Genesis and Saturn controllers, and have even released a new wireless Saturn controller with added analog sticks.


I could honestly use a wireless Dreamcast controller. Living rooms have changed, and I have had to buy cable extenders for my wired ones. On the other hand, I don’t need a new stick. I’ve done modifications on the one I currently use to make it suit my preferences, and they take up a lot of space. However, if the design changes to something closer to a Sega Astro City panel, then I may be enticed.


No word on when we’ll see either of the controllers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the Black Ops 6 beta on the horizon, Treyarch and Raven Software aim to increase the excitement even more with its Multiplayer Reveal trailer.


The trailer jams in plenty of new and returning Call of Duty features, with one of the stand-outs being the body shield tactic. You may remember this Black Ops Cold War mechanic, allowing you to pick up a body and use it as a defense mechanism. Black Ops 6 offers this maneuver once again, which will go along nicely with its new Omnimovement.




Besides the body shields, we got a brief snippet of some shiny new toys to try. One, in particular, is a baseball bat melee weapon with a brutal Finishing Move. The RC-XD (Remote Controlled Explosive Device) also makes an appearance, bringing chaos along with it. Both tools were a part of past Call of Duty iterations, and now they'll be revamped in BO6.


The list of returning CoD features from this latest trailer could go on and on, including the classic tomahawks and Prestige system. Plus, the reveal confirms the comeback of the Prestige Master, a mechanic that permits players to reach Level 1,000. Although you won't be able to use it in the beta, it should be good to go by launch day.

In addition to this content, you can look forward to plenty of new features, especially with the 16 Black Ops 6 exclusive maps. The trailer already gave us a sneak peek into the brand-new locations, from the tropics to desolate buildings. It also teases the upcoming Operator skins that may tie into the Zombies Terminus crew.


You can experience this new world of Call of Duty once the Black Ops 6 beta and early access drops. But, if you want to make more preparations, get ready for the COD Next event on Aug. 28 for additional BO6 content.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The adorable yet powerful ensemble of Generation 8 will finally be coming to Pokémon Go as Niantic unveils a teaser of the upcoming Max Out event.


Sword and Shield fans will quickly notice the sightings of Grookey, Scorbunny, and Sobble. The creatures made their mark as starters in Pokémon SW and SH, encapsulating Grass, Fire, and Water Types. Now, they'll seemingly return to Pokémon Go for the Max Out event from Sept. 3 to Dec. 3.




The teaser also showcases a possible Gigantamax Form toward the end, which is another Sword and Shield exclusive. This form substantially increases a Pokémon's size, similar to Go's XXL creatures. It also offers G-Max moves that take their normal attacks to new heights.


Although the event is still under wraps, the starters and the Gigantamax Form Pokémon will likely be obtainable during the celebration. Grookey, Scorbunny, and Sobble have the potential to work their way up the meta, as we've seen with Generation 7's Popplio and Generation 9's Fuecoco.

Grookey proves to be an excellent Grass Type, with its two robust evolutions, Thwackey and Rillaboom. Then, there's the fiery Fire Type, Scorbunny, considered the best starter of Sword and Shield. But, if you're more of a Water enthusiast, Sobble can be a beast on the battlefield, especially with its all-powerful evolution forms.


Since the Pokémon Go Max Out event is out in September, we should be getting more news on what it will entail. Many other events, including the Ponyta and Galarian Community Day, are already in the works. So, clear your calendars and get your Poké Balls ready for Generation 8's debut on Sept. 3.

Over the years, I have played with franchisees of all caliber and squad strengths. Having a sound scouting policy is second to none.

This makes it vital for you to understand the basics and master all the concepts.

The critical part is to have a good scout setup. In Franchise mode, you can have a maximum of five scouts, who are graded between 1-star and 3-star. You can't have all five of them to be at 3-stars; there will always have to be three 1-star s…]]></summary>

Most of these leaks have come from FC content specialists and leakers like @ASYFutTrader and @FUTSheriff, along with @FUTScoreboard. Of course, I am a firm believer in waiting for the official data reveal, since EA Sports can change the numbers anytime prior to the launch. Still, it's always a fun task to look at what the rumors suggest, and I will be pretty amazed at some of the reportedly "leaked" overalls of some footballers.

This is made easier by Valve offering a default build for every character, but you can ultimately do much better than that. Here's the best build for Grey Talon in Deadlock.

Grey Talon's power is based mostly around a barrage of Bullet Damage combined with a metric ton of Spirit damage. As such, we want to focus the build around mixing these two things together so that, while you aren't doing an insane amount of one or the other, you're doing more than enough to pepper your targets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While killing enemies and controlling lanes are the main objectives in Deadlock, other objectives matter just as much and are crucial once you step into the late game.


One such buff that might not be self-explanatory is the Rejuvenator, and its Rejuvenation Credit buff. Here's what the Rejuvenator does in Deadlock.


What does the Rejuvenation Credit buff do in Deadlock?


Image via Destructoid.


The Rejuvenation Credit buff is given upon killing the Mid Boss, marked by a small golden symbol in the middle of the map. This boss, when killed, drops the Rejuvenator, which you need to heavy melee to secure. Once you do, all living teammates will be granted the Rejuvenation Credit buff for a lengthy period. This buff causes all minions you kill to drop 50% more souls and reduces the timer on your next respawn by half. It also grants increased health regeneration.


The Rejuvenation Credit buff is lost upon death, though the respawn reduction applies to this death. It's also worth noting that this buff can be stolen by the enemy team. If your team manages to kill the Mid Boss, but fails to melee the Rejuvenator before the enemies do, they'll receive the buff instead.


When should you go for the mid boss and Rejuvenator?


Your team should attempt the mid boss either when you have a substantial lead or when several enemy players are dead. If you attempt the Mid Boss while all enemies are up, there's a good chance they could rush into the mid boss room and melt your team. 


Worse yet, one person could sneak in and steal it. If the enemies are defending all lanes from minions in their base, it could be worth the risk. All in all, you should attempt it very cautiously and assess the situation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’ve got the stomach for some disturbing space horror, Mouthwashing will have you covered on September 26, 2024. It’s coming to PC.


That’s exciting. Y’know, in an “I can’t wait to be existentially distressed” kind of way. Did you play the demo? I can’t see this one having a happy ending. It’s about a crew of five people stranded in space after a disaster upends their long-haul delivery mission. The captain has been left immolated and is dubiously alive. Supplies are low, and chances of rescue are slim. Everybody hates each other, and these contents are under pressure.




The crew decides to open up the cargo hold and find stacks of boxes packed with bottles of mouthwash. High in both sugar and ethanol, great for what ails you. The game jumps around back and forth in time, and nightmarish sequences are interspersed throughout.


The scariest part, though? Each time the scene transitions, the game looks like it glitches out, and the audio hitches like your computer is crashing. It got me more times than I want to admit.


This is all based on the demo, by the way. Anything could have been changed by now. However, it was a ridiculously effective demo, which is still available if you want to try it out. Its audio-visual tricks just make things all the more uncomfortable. It doesn’t matter if a monster shows up at that point. The isolation of the ship, the people inside, and the vast vacuum around it are scary enough.


Mouthwashing releases for PC on September 26, 2024.

The Casting of Frank Stone is a story set in the Dead by Daylight universe and intrinsically linked to its lore.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atari has revealed Fatal Run 2089, a very late sequel to the very late 1990 game Fatal Run. More importantly, I don’t remember the last time I played a decent, new vehicular combat game. Maybe Gas Guzzlers Extreme or Carmageddon: Max Damage. Quite a drought in games about stapling miniguns to station wagons.


Fatal Run was a very latterday game for the Atari 2600 and 7800. As such, it was pretty much unknown to anyone outside the core fanbase of those consoles until its inclusion in the Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration. That’s when I played it, and while the 2600 version just feels significant for the way it translated the game to well-fermented hardware, the 7800 version was fun. Of course, as a fan of raster racing games and car combat, I was set.




Fatal Run 2089 looks pretty fun. It’s running on Unreal Engine 5, but I wouldn’t have guessed that. It has the grungy metal look and simple terrain of an Unreal Engine 3 title. However, it does have it where it counts, by which I mean when you land a jump, the camera shakes to make it seem like your car is very heavy. Like in Burnout 3 or Split/Second.


There are corkscrews, 20 tracks, and I spy boss vehicles. The press release promises “branching paths, hidden shortcuts, and explosive set pieces that keep every run intense and unpredictable.” There are seven vehicles, four bosses, and you can upgrade your vehicle by picking up (in-game) currency.


Fatal Run 2089 is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch (?) and PC sometime in 2025.

But as many might have realized during its tests, although welcoming, the game has a pretty steep learning curve, especially for those new to fighting games in general. To help you get ready for its official debut, here are the 10 best fighting games to play while waiting for 2XKO.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Supermassive Games and Publisher Behaviour Interactive have announced that from August 26, 2024, fans have a chance to try out a Steam demo for their upcoming title, The Casting of Frank Stone. The demo allows you to test out the horror before its September release date. 


In this demo, players take on the role of Sam Green, an extremely determined policeman who is on a case to find a missing child. This case leads him to the disturbing location of Cedar Hills Steel Mill, a place brimming with secrets yearning to terrify those willing to discover them. Those secrets will reveal a truth so sinister it will turn Green's stomach, but he must continue in his pursuit of hopefully saving a life.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new Nintendo stream is upon us, and it's airing on pretty short notice. Tomorrow, August 27, Nintendo will host a two-part stream featuring an Indie World Showcase followed by a Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase.


The stream goes live at 7 a.m. PT / 10 a.m. ET on Nintendo's YouTube and other channels. The Indie World Showcase will air first, followed by the Partner Showcase, for a total of roughly 40 minutes, after all is said and done.




In case the names didn't tip you off, don't expect any news about the successor to the Nintendo Switch here. Not only do these streams normally not focus on Nintendo news (Partners and Indies are both third-party showcases), but Nintendo is outright saying that there will be no mention of the Switch successor.




What can we expect then? Well, the Silksong faithful are already donning their clown masks. And I mean, we have to hear something about that game again at some point, right? Oh no. It's happening to me too.


I expect the Indie World side of things to be full of surprises and, fingers crossed, a "later today" drop or two. Those are always exciting to see, and my Switch could use a new indie game or two to pick away at.


As for the Partner Showcase, that will be all third-party offerings. My best speculation is to expect some frequent collaborators; Square Enix, for example, or Marvelous. I'd love to get some more details on whatever Level-5 has been up to as well. After the delay of Fantasy Life i into 2025, I'm curious about where that's left their other games, like Decapolice.


We'll find out what's in store for the Switch as we head into the Nintendo Direct double-header tomorrow at 7 a.m. PT.

The studio, itself, is relatively new, as a Belgium independent-led company in Brussels. Koira marks its first-ever game release with Life Is Strange and Jusant publisher Don't Nod. I got the chance to play the entry's demo for a brief sneak peek. Although it lasted less than an hour, it was the most calming part of my day, with the melodic tunes of its peaceful soundtrack and the heartwarming moments shared with its dog companion.

Retro Games Ltd has been creating mini consoles based on microcomputers for a while now and has released The C64 Mini (Commodore 64), The A500 Mini (Commodore Amiga), and The 400 Mini (Atari 400). This time around, they’re resurrecting Sinclair’s ZX Spectrum, which is, in my opinion, one of the coolest 8-bit home computers. It’s the distinctive color palette that makes it for me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disney Dreamlight Valley has over 1,000 clothing types you can obtain between the base game and its expansions, giving you limitless ways to design your day-to-day fashion. What better way to appreciate your favorite outfits than to save them as a preset and return to them whenever you'd like?


Where to find and save outfit presets in Disney Dreamlight Valley


Here are the exact steps you can use to save outfit presets in Disney Dreamlight Valley:



Open your inventory.


Select Wardrobe.


Open the Favorites category.


Pick Add New and choose a name for your outfit preset.



Screenshot by Destructoid


You can save up to four presets at a time, giving you several, albeit not unlimited, outfit options. From here, you can select any preset to equip it, giving you a quick and easy way to wear those clothes again if you have to swap them out for any reason.


Screenshot by Destructoid


Alongside equipping your presets, you can also overwrite them to replace the outfit with what you're wearing now, rename it to make it easier to distinguish from others, or delete it to make room for another set. Since there's a four preset limit, you can't have hundreds of clothing options to swap through, but you can have a few of your favorites that you can tweak through the regular wardrobe categories.


Having presets is especially helpful if you're completing quests or completing Daisy's Boutique challenges and don't want to risk losing your current outfit. That way, you can wear the mission's clothes or accessories and return to your previous outfit later without searching through each category for items.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Almost a decade after his acrimonious departure from Konami, the shadow of Hideo Kojima still looms over Metal Gear Solid. He's there, barely camouflaged, in the undergrowth of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater - a remake of the fifth Metal Gear game, originally released in 2004, which tells the tale of a lone US special operator hunting superweapons and old mentors in the jungles of the southern Soviet Union. 


I say "remake" but this feels more like a re-release, in spirit. True, it now runs on Unreal Engine, with the option of a manual, third-person perspective and cover-shooter controls in addition to the old top-down viewpoints. Yes, it boasts new flourishes, such as wounds now leaving scars, and clothes picking up stray leaves. Yes, there's a new interface with floating in-world menus, which makes shuffling between the layers a bit less awkward. It's the product of much labour, with development split between Konami and external support partner Virtuos. But where Konami's other big restoration project, Bloober's Silent Hill 2 remake, is a creative dialogue with the original game, Delta seems consumed by faithfulness to Kojima's original design.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The longest journey for a slice of strawberry pie.
Would you battle fearsome monsters for a homemade strawberry pie? If so, you’re in good company. WitchSpring R is a whimsical, story-driven RPG that follows the story of Pieberry, a talented young witch who’s grown up in the woods by herself.
As the name might suggest, Pieberry is a big fan of pies. And strawberries. The story starts off calmly enough, with Pieberry attempting to leave her magical forest home to track down a strawberry pie like the one she ate as a child, all while trying to understand why she was seemingly abandoned by her parents. It spirals from there, with a vast world and vibrant roster of characters, ranging from pudding monsters and lightning lions to witch hunters and celestial beings. It’s a narrative-driven experience, but the gameplay switches from turn-based combat to fun puzzles quickly.

Neither Mantel nor Beaton mention mechs, which are a core feature of Studio Imugi's new "ideology driven" turn-based strategy game Bonaparte: A Mechanized Revolution. I, for one, feel like I've been grossly ill-informed. Kate, Hilary - I've been quoting you for years at parties and it seems like all this time, people have been silently judging me for my ignorance of the role giant clockwork soldiers played in the fall of the Bastille.

It’s also not a terribly accurate one. From what I saw of the game, Dinolords is more about the lords than the dinos, having as much in common with Diablo-style ARPGs as it does with classic strategy. And that’s a distinction which might just elevate it out of novelty status.

Trailered this week at Gamescom 2024, it's the fifth installment in the hitherto mobile-focussed Nikki series and it's seemingly going down a storm, with over 12 million pre-registrations so far (albeit, many of them motivated by the prospect of collectively unlocked in-game bonuses). It's also a free-to-play game, and I have the usual unanswered questions about currencies and gacha, but I'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt for the minute, because I have not spent nearly enough of my life considering the tactical applications of ballgowns. Here's that trailer.

However! Turns out you’re trying to kill the queen. Yep, that’s, uh, that’s pretty punk.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my formative video game moments is the final mission of Psygnosis cyberpunk flight sim G-Police. (It came out in 1997, and as such, I think the statute of limitations on spoilers has passed, but if you still intend to play, stop reading now.) The mission completes the long arc of foreshadowing begun by the intro's mention that capital-class spacecraft have been outlawed, following a ruinous war. It turns out that one particular evil corpo has been sneakily building one of these megaships - not only that, but you get to fly inside it, cannons ablazing. It was while doing so that teenage me realised the true exceptionality of the Video Game Artform. You can't fly inside capital ships in, like, symbolist poems or baroque symphonies, can you? You can't fly in poems or symphonies at all, unless you do so metaphorically - "metaphor" being a kind of poor man's graphics card.
The technology of flight simming has advanced mightily since G-Police's day. For instance: in Everspace 2's just-announced Titans DLC, you get to fly inside not just regular old spaceships, but massive space kaiju with procedurally generated digestive systems. Here's the trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin's Creed: Valhalla, Odyssey, and Origins all have one thing in common: they've got a Discovery mode, which replaces murdering with learning. You can, quite literally, go on tours curated by historians around each of the game's respective maps. Instead of diving off a Sphinx and plunging your hidden blade into someone's spinal column, you can look up at the Sphinx and read a paragraph on its significance. Maybe view an actual, real life bit of ancient Egypt from an actual real life museum collection in-game. Perhaps embody an Anglo-Saxon lad in Valhalla, instead, and like, cook up some nettle soup having just got a fresh "Friar Tuck" at the local hair choppers (no guarantees on this last bit).
This is all to say that Black Myth: Wukong deserves such a mode, too. There were so many times throughout my review time where I stopped and stared and wondered as to something's meaning. Not only in the architecture, but in the characters, too. So here I am with a proposition: how about instead of thwacking things with my staff, I can use it as a walking stick and point it at things I want to learn about.

If a park sim based on Tim Burton’s 1996 B-Movie homage Mars Attacks wasn’t on my bingo card, it’s because I’ve recently binned it and replaced it with a bobble head that simply nods in amused acceptance at whatever videogames decide to do next. And conceptually, Jurassic World Evolution with captive humans instead of dinos isn’t not a potential winner, is it? Still, I was mildly bemused to learn that Mars Attracts, coming sometime next year, is the film’s first licensed game. But then I realised that I’d never thought to check before, which might go some way to explaining the lack of them. Do you reckon they did the pun then worked backwards from there? Respectable, honestly.

My turn to puff out my cheeks and look not angry, just disappointed: why haven't we covered The Stone Of Madness prior to the below Gamescom 2024 story trailer? I mean, it's only a real-time tactical stealth game set in a cursed 18th century Jesuit monastery, developed by the people behind gorgeously gross metroidvania Blasphemous. It's only got isometric art inspired by Goya and a sanity/trauma system redolent of Darkest Dungeon. Sounds like an automatic RPS write-up to me.

He'd tackle headscratchers by unwinding the very fabric of his body, similar to how a human being might feed their intestines through a karabiner and use it as a tether for a spot of rock climbing. Well, some of the minds behind Unravel are working on new game called Hela. This time it's less about yarn and more about being a small mouse who does parkour. Still, it does retain some of the bodily gymnastics of its predecessor. Namely the use of tongues as bungee ropes.

Whether plundering the earth in SteamWorld Dig 2 or mucking about with magic in SteamWorld Quest, these are solid and approachable adventures that enthusiastically embrace whatever theme the developers have decided upon. Cowboys? Sure. Wizards? Why not. It barely matters, as long as it results in some good puns. As a studio, Thunderful have a reputation for hopping from one style of game to the next, boiling entire genres down to their essence, and reconstituting them with competence and style to exist within a now-familiar steampunk world of colourful pals and Saturday morning cartoon jokes. The studio is a perpetual notion machine. Yes, with SteamWorld Heist 2, they're revisiting the sci-fi bullet-bouncing of their 2016 tactics game SteamWorld Heist, but they're also introducing significant changes to create a compulsive XCOM-like full of sea-faring submariners that may be their best work yet, even against a back catalogue of blinders.

The Shattered Space expansion, out on September 30th, probably won’t refurbish the RPG’s reputation as an overall miss – but it does ditch the proc-gen planet bloat for a single handcrafted hellhole, a true Bethesda speciality honed by years of Fallouts and Elder Scrollseses. And, if its - sadly hands-off - Gamescom showcase is any indication, it might just double down on Starfield’s own strengths as well.

In development at Sniper Elite makers Rebellion, it’s a "survival-action game inspired by real-life events" – specifically the Windscale fire, which in 1957 coated much of northern England in radioactive fallout. Atomfall’s alternative history makes Britain’s worst nuclear disaster even more disastrous, plunging the realm into full-on post-apocalyptica and leaving your good amnesiac self to dodge death with nothing but a cricket bat and whatever you can scrounge out of sheds. I like it! Mostly.

I dare boldly to maintain that there is such a thing as Too Wide, a point beyond which the extra visual estate becomes a waste of electricity, unless you watch the screen in pairs. I can only assume people who use ultrawide monitors live in constant terror of flanking manoeuvres and demand the maximum amount of peripheral vision. Mind you, I tend to play games with my nose about 10 centimetres from the screen. Forget being flanked - it's the prospect of snipers up ahead I'm worried about.
If you're among the people who fret excessively about flankers, I've got great news from Uncle BioWare. Forthcoming RPG Dragon Age: The Veilguard will support 21:9 ultrawide monitors. The ultrawide functionality extends to cinematics - you can disable "cinematic aspect ratios" to switch off the black bars that otherwise hem in the view. It's one of several PC-specific flourishes they've just blogged about. Have a look.

Unfortunately for James, he accidentally walked straight into Gamescom. “I’m starting to think that there are a lot of video games” he informed us yesterday. Horrifying if true. Still, it does sound like he’s managing to have some fun there, mainly by hitting up Saber Interactive COO and former id Software co-owner Tim Willits for some top tips on how to avenge Edwin’s thieving ways.
Tips about kill-stealing aside, James found time to ask Willits about Space Marine 2's microtransactions, and whether there was any nervousness returning to a cult hit series… especially one a lot of people had almost given up on ever seeing again. “Even the “push forward” combat of the original was part of [id’s] inspiration when we created Doom 2016,” answered Willits. “So for me personally, it’s this huge circle. It’s always intimidating working on a franchise that people love.” But, with the right team, technology, and vision he says, “it just comes together.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Now, I never played quite as much as our Brendy did of the original Splitgate. But I had a fun time with its mixture of Halo-esque trigger pulling and portalling around! So I was intrigued to give the alpha version of Splitgate 2 a go and see if it had a little more substance to it than its initial reveal, which gave off a, "it's Splitgate but with more money" feel. 
Well, I think it's… a bit serious? It certainly has more polish and some extra additions, yet I didn't come away from it thrilled by its more competitive, class-based FPS leanings. I think it just needs a bit more time, perhaps, for a portal to open and some silly rocket launchers and baseball bats and zombies to come tumbling out of it.

And in a "hah, take this Overwatch!" way, they've also announced that all of its heroes will be unlocked for everyone straight off the bat (man). Oh no wait, he's DC isn't he. To be fair, I've only watched one Avengers film, two Captain Americas, and Thor: Ragnarok (without seeing the other Thors). All of which I have zero recollection of. Anyway, yes, Marvel Rivals.

If you have have experience of the London rental market, you are probably reading this and thinking: “He’s got a front door? Such extravagance. I live in a folded umbrella.” Touché, my friend. I guess it’s just as well we have spaciously proportioned first-person puzzle adventures to console us in our time of compound elbow bruises, rising damp and preposterous financial debt. On which note, Looking For Fael seems fun.

Yes, yes, it is the unmistakable rumble of a large survival MMO pondering its release date. Dune: Awakening is having a think and has decided "early 2025" is a good non-specific time period to come out in early access. That could mean January or February. Or March, I guess. April? Now don't be silly, that's spring. Not April, surely. This beast seems hungry. It will eat before then. I have foreseen it. Mostly by watching the trailer that dropped at Gamescom.

That's partly because Embark Studios' other in-development game, The Finals, progressed faster than planned and stole its momentum. It's also because it was re-tooled at some point as a PvPvE extraction shooter.

Now it's back again, aiming for release next year, and it's been re-tooled a little more: it's no longer free-to-play.

Maybe just, you know, a crumb of acknowledgement or elucidation over the whole ‘interactivity’ part?
Anyway, don’t mind me. I’m just an old fool who likes to press buttons. And, to be fair, it's not like Machinegames don't have a great track record. Anyway, here’s some good news: The game releases December 9th this year. Have a release date trailer.

So much so, in fact, that I’d assumed the trailer I watched during an online preview event last week was for a new entry in the horror cinematic-platformer series, right up until the name Reanimal appeared on the screen - shortly followed by a snippet of voiced dialogue.
It’s not just the horror setting, but the Grimm’s fairytale threat, the distorted adults-made-monsters through the trauma-tinged lens of a child’s imagination. A long-limbed man riding a bicycle in a threadbare suit chases children down an alley. A gangly, bowler-hatted pursuer scuttles down a long table like a spider. It's familiar enough territory, at least at first glance. But when Tarsier have a body of work subconsciously scarred by phantasms this vivid, recurring nightmares are just as potent.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MachineGames have made a decent living as the creators of satirical alternate histories in which you messily murder Nazis using mighty double-handfuls of shotgun. There are Nazis to fight in Indiana Jones And The Great Circle - a globe-trotting, tomb-robbing adventure featuring a Lost Ark-era Harrison Ford - but as you'd expect from a Lucasfilm adaptation, there's rather less of the bloodshed.

In development at Molyneux's 2012-founded studio 22cans, it looks like a mix of Populous and Black & White with knocked-together, toylike visuals, and a loose tower-defence format whereby monsters attack your villages at night. Here's the first trailer.

Do a game related verb I can’t accurately name because I never played past that beach at the beginning of the first game, and do it in the general direction of the trailer below. Watch it.

Out in 2025, Directive 8020 is the story of the good ship Cassiopeia, a human colony vessel that is infiltrated by Something Icky. The Something Icky is capable of mimicking humans. So that'd be a bit like Alien and a bit like The Thing, then. Sorry, human colonists!
Directive 8020 was teased at the end of the last Dark Pictures instalment, 2022's The Devil in Me. A trailer also leaked back in November 2022. Now, we have an official announcement video.

"To show appreciation for the community who patiently waited for the DLC, Techland will be offering Dying Light: The Beast at no extra cost to all owners of the Dying Light 2 Stay Human Ultimate Edition, delivering a full standalone adventure instead of just a DLC." That's nice! 
This seems like an odd one. I’m only tangentially familiar with the Dying Light games, but I was under the impression that the model here was releasing a single game, then updating and expanding it for years. Whether standalone adventure Dying Light: The Beast represents an attempt to course correct after Dying Light 2’s mixed reception, then, I’m not entirely sure. But if nothing else, it does share something in common with all the other adverts at Gamescom tonight: it is a game that exists, and will presumably be playable at some point.

Think a mixture of logistics, cars, cranes, and paving some lovely new roads from a once dilapidated junk heap.

You could make the same argument at the opposite end of spectrum, of course. Cosy games seem locked in a perpetual arms-race to twee each other into the dirt, chopping their rival’s dog-petting hands off and taking a sparkly tinkle on their pastel corpses. But hand-drawn RPG Heroes Of The Seven Islands feels more authentic than all that. It’s bedroom antifolk by way of chill dungeon synth, by way of an antelope sorcerer named Jean-Pierre.

Reviewer Edders went so far as to find the world more engaging than that of Elden Ring - proper defying-the-gods level rhetoric. Players seem to agree. The game launched last night, and has already accrued a concurrent player peak of 1.44 million - Steam's fourth highest ever, exceeded only by Counter-Strike, Palworld and PUBG. By that metric, it's the platform's most popular strictly single player game of all the time.
All that goodwill has been spoiled, however, by a Steam code handout message to streamers and other "content creators" before launch which includes some reactionary, non-binding requests - no mention of "trigger words" like "Covid-19", no talk of "politics" or "feminist propaganda", and no mention of "China's game industry policies, opinions, news, etc".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tactical Breach Wizards is a tactics game for people that don’t like tactics games. Magically, it’s also a tactics game for people who love them like nothing else. It’s permissive and demanding; playful and tense. Its globe-spanning plot covers conspiracies, PMCs, and brutal theocratic dictatorships. It also features a traffic-summoning warlock named Steve wearing a hi-vis robe. It’s finding that one absolutely, perfectly ridiculous XCOM turn, every turn…and at the same time knowing it’s absolutely, perfectly fine if you don’t. In short: it’s one of the most enjoyable tactics games I’ve ever played, and the only tactics game with a pyromancer so rubbish he relies on making his enemies pass out from heatstroke.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Please lock your Chocobos to attack position and set your Phoenix Downs to stun: Square Enix have released fresh details of Final Fantasy 16's PC port, which has now been dated for launch on 17th September. They've also shared a little about why it's taken so long to arrive - the (generally decent) action-RPG hit PS5 over a year ago, back when I was still some filthy console-playing freelancer.
According to director Hiroshi Takai, it was "impossible" to create the PC and PS5 versions at the same time, even if Square Enix hadn't been restrained by a timed exclusivity clause. He also thinks that the Final Fantasy series faces no "existential risk" right now, despite lower-than-hoped returns from both Final Fantasy 16 and, going by Square Enix's latest financial reports, the more recent and currently PS5-only Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Silent Hill has a messy, up-is-down relationship with time and history, so let's go about this hands-on with the Silent Hill 2 Remake in a messy, up-is-down way. Developed well over two decades ago, the original Silent Hill 2 is the magnum opus of Polish horror stalwarts Bloober Team. Running on then-innovative "Unreal Engine 5" technology created by Jazz Jackrabbit publishers Epic MegaGames, it's a wonderful abyss of a game that remains perfectly playable today, given a certain amount of tolerance for the quirks of the era.
It begins with your character, James Sunderland, descending from the road towards the eponymous Midwestern nowhere-town. Like many games of the period, Silent Hill 2 uses a third-person, over-the-shoulder manual camera, which allows you to glance fearfully up at the monstrous pine trees that fringe the path - each rising from a bulging tide of fog that menaces with the suggestion of approaching figures. There is moisture everywhere, gushing from drain pipes and dribbling down concrete barriers. As you amble into the murk, deathly chords and groaning, unmechanical motifs reverberate from somewhere deep underground.

This is not the same as Lovecraft refreshment, no matter how much I might want to return to the days before old one plushies and Cthulhu children’s books terrorised the internet en masse. There’s not quite enough information about “story generator” sim Marry a Deep One: Innsmouth Simulator for me to confidently say it’ll cut through my exhaustion with all things tentacular and horrifically be-gilled. But it is beguiling, isn’t it? There’s all sorts of little widgets and details shown off that remind me of everything from Sid Meier’s Pirates to classic adventure games, and maybe even a little Rimworld? It’s a heady soup, although one I’d recommend against quaffing, given where the water comes from.

Twitchy slashfest Dead Cells received its final major update, introducing new enemies, fresh weapons, and a few mutations. Unfortunately, all this new stuff is very cursed. In other words, it all toys with the game's "curse" status effect, a hex that causes you to be killed if you take even a single hit. You'll probably die a few times as a result of this update, which in some ways is a fitting finalé for this fast-paced jar smasher of a game. You can see the new features in the trailer below.

The 2022 version of Modern Warfare 2 lacked the original’s multiplayer, and H2M was so highly-anticipated that Steam sales of the 2016 FPS balooned in the lead-up to the mod’s planned release date. It didn't hurt that Activision had it on sale, of course, but the timing lined up so well that some fans speculated the discount was a deliberate bait-and-switch on the publisher’s part to profit from excitement over a mod they were already planning to shut down.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Bloober and Konami announced that they were remaking Silent Hill 2 as part of a comprehensive series reboot, it made immediate if slightly deflating sense to me. Silent Hill 2 is the more feted of the Hills - if I were a calculating franchise custodian tasked with 'bringing back' one of the acclaimed original trilogy, that's probably the instalment I and my spreadsheets would fix upon. I mean, it's the game with Pyramid Head in it - the nearest thing Silent Hill has to a mascot, and it's not like there's an issue of cutting out plot material: each game in the Silent Hill series is, on some level, a distinct story with a distinct protagonist.
Still, the decision to 'skip' the first game in the series, whose world, narrative themes, music and art direction set the parameters for all the rest, made my brain itch a bit, and when I ran into Bloober's creative director Mateusz Lenart and lead producer Maciej Głomb at a Konami event, I had to ask about it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've got a real soft spot for Trombone Champ, a rhythm game about tooting along to music that works perfectly with the mouse. I'm also a huge fan of Beat Saber, a rhythm game in which you slice at blocks that whizz towards you in VR.

You can see where this is going. Trombone Champ: Unflattened transports that 2022 tooting into 2024 virtual reality.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Minecraft's Realms servers have been down for most of the past four days. Mojang's official account for reporting service status updates noted that "intermittent failures or slowdowns" began on August 13th, and despite similarly intermittent reports of uptime in the days since, the servers remain inaccessible to most players today.

NVIDIA admittedly used pirated books to train these models, which triggered a copyright infringement lawsuit. This week, the company informed the court that these claims fall flat, arguing that copyrighted books are nothing more than statistical correlations to its AI models.

The complaint followed the familiar 'repeat infringer' format, with damages for works in suit worth over a billion dollars and everything on the line. A joint filing this week reveals that the lawsuit has been dismissed with prejudice, never to see the light of day again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baroque wilderness-builder Nightingale has not been doing brilliantly since Ed Thorn described the launch early access version as "a numbers grind disguised as a gaslamp survival game". We had moderately high hopes for it before the early access release - I personally enjoy the fairytale setting, with its pop-up Pucks and magic umbrellas, but I also think I've raised enough hovels on procedurally generated maps for one lifetime. Still, I'd quite like it to come good, if only so I can justify op-eds about Lewis Carroll, and I'm somewhat encouraged by what I've heard of the game's forthcoming Realms Rebuilt update.

Wham! Bam! You reel back in consternation as I bounce into the path and clobber you with a sack containing no less than eight venerable RPGs, from Baldur's Gate to Warhammer 40,000: Rogue's Trader - well over a thousand hours worth of dungeons, dragons, dicerolls, dwarven shopkeepers and many other things I refuse to spend time alliterating, all of which will (currently) set you back just £32.07. 


Were you planning to spend this weekend playing some cute two-hour artgame sideshow, without any levelling at all? Shut up, you DOLT. You will play what the nice journalist tells you to play! Best lay in extra caffeine tablets, because it's going to take you till Monday just to get through the character creators alone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Black Myth: Wukong is an action RPG that leans a bit into the Souls camp and a bit into the adventure camp. And either way, it's a spectacular journey that works for mostly everyone: those after challenging fights against Chinese mythological creatures, and those after the same thing, but with a little less challenge than your typical Soulslikes. What separates Black Myth from the crowd, though, is its slick presentation and a sense of generosity. You're to witness the most lavish, cinematic worlds and its creatures. And you're to enjoy battering everything with your staff as a highly athletic monkey with copious spells at his furry follicles and fingertips. It's been a while since I've played anything quite as impressive as this.

The strategy game’s 5.2 update is on the horizon, and tagging along with it are the first of the “extra bits” the team teased in June. I’m very excited about them. They sit somewhere between the usual patch fare of stat tweaks and errata, and the weightier faction facelifts that come alongside paid DLC. They’re also focused right where Immortal Empires needs them the most: depth, rather than width. In the dawi’s case, quite literally.

Alongside the likes of the Descenders and Riders Republic, it offered a more laid-back game, open to furious time trialling but always remembering to let you stop and appreciate the view. Both the stakes and the poly count were low. Happy news then, that it is getting a snowy sequel. In Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders you'll be swapping your bike for a pair of skis, and you'll be able to barrel down the mountainside with friends in co-op.

Like 13th century peasants straining to convey huge, teetering loads of freshly quarried LMGs, our SSDs cry out for justice. Perhaps scenting imminent rebellion and a mass audience desertion to low-poly shooters with more civilised file sizes, Activision have relented. Future installations of the much-padded FPS will be "smaller and more customised", though in a last cruel stroke of villainy, they want you to download a large update to prepare the ground.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The management game progression chart is supposed to go: zoo, then theme park, then hospital, then school. Apparently no one told Springloaded Software, who are following up their 2021 tycoon 'em up Let's Build A Zoo with a game about building an MMO. 

Let's Build A Dungeon marries the business aspects of Game Dev Tycoon with a more hands-on approach to constructing your company's game, and there's a first trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Space 4X strategy game Stellaris launched in 2016, but Paradox can't stop adding to the universe. Last time I checked in, it was school trips to other dimensions. Now, it's Cosmic Storms. Due for release alongside the Stellaris 3.13 Vela update on September 10th, these are a paid "mechanical expansion" (priced at a rather chunky £11, $13 or €13, and available as part of the current season pass) that builds upon the game's existing Space Storms, "providing a deeper experience with strategically meaningful gameplay and beautiful upgraded visuals". Wash that down with new civics, precursor narratives, anomalies, archaeology sites, techs, edicts, a new Ascension perk, and new galactic community resolutions.

You remember that thing, right? Plus, no-one’s got a big enough table. Or the new errata. Also, Trevor’s been banging on about lady Custodes for five months straight and nobody wants to be around him right now. Thank the Omni-trevor, then, for the three-player co-op of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2. “Warhammer with the boys?” said Horace as he stretchily dished out preview keys from an entirely different postcode. James, Edwin and Nic were initially all booked-up for the week, but Horace repeated himself, making it absolutely clear that it wasn’t a question.

Some readers characterised this as a familiar species of cultural hypocrisy regarding video games - emphasising violence is A-OK, but for the love of god, don't mention sex. Good news, those people: Dread XP's latest horror signing The Lacerator has both. It casts you as hirsute 1980s porn star Max - surname not given in press release, but presumably something like Jackin' or Girth - who has been abducted by a large scary individual called the Lacerator.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over 2000 hours spent in various factory games makes me a bit of a purist, I suppose. In theory, I should then be the ideal reviewer to enjoy Shapez 2. But I'm also the ideal reviewer to tear it apart over the most minor hiccups and defects. I'm the Anton Ego of factory games. I don't like food, I love it. If I don't love it, I don't swallow.
Ah, you needn't worry. This is by far the most fun I've had reviewing a game, and Shapez 2 has, in my mind at least, turned the holy trinity of factory games (Factorio, Satisfactory, Dyson Sphere Program) into a holy quartet. Its pared back, everything-is-free-forever approach is quite liberating, and I've never had so much fun placing conveyor belts in my life. But 40 hours into my save file, I've often found myself yearning for a bit more creativity in the challenges, a few more curveballs sent in my direction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s an oddly Halloweeny summer week for games, this one. Dragon Age: The Veilguard’s October 31st release date leaked earlier, Steam have put together a Summer Fright Night bundle featuring RPS fave Hauntii, and I’ve got a strange urge to gorge on Haribo and mini Double Deckers until blood comes out of my eyeballs. What a perfect time, then, to dive into the alpha demo for vampire management game Blood Bar Tycoon, especially since Two Point seem to be resting on their laurels a bit too comfortably for my liking.
The idea here is you build a swanky bar serving claret cosmopolitans, ichor-ish coffees and uh, viscera vampiros to your undead clientele. But (with the sorta exception of the crimson-sapped Dracaena cinnabari) blood doesn’t grow on trees, so you’ll also be moonlighting as a human-nabber. You’ll research a slew of “whacky contraptions” to extract their blood, which I greatly enjoy, because “zany exsanguination” is a real winner of a feature. You can’t frivolously phlebotomise with impunity, however - you’ll also want to be on the lookout for vampire hunters aka the fun police.

The changes are part of their ‘New Helpfulness System’, outlined here.
The new system, which will be enabled by default but can be toggled off, aims to “help potential players make informed decisions about the games they are considering purchasing by understanding the attributes of the game that other players like or don't like.” Ah, so a sort of ‘review’, if you will.

It's 2D pixel art, with a limited colour palette as in EGA games, and you control it with a text parser, like King's Quest or one of them other Sierra adventures old men like Graham remember. It's important to mention this up front because it's very possible that, despite The Crimson Diamond's tale of betrayal, murder, and mineral rights in 1914 Canada, the text parser element will be a Rubicon you instantly can't be arsed to cross. A not unreasonable stance - though I think the text parser in The Crimson Diamond is fantastic. Such beef that I have with this adventure game is down to the specificity required to solve some of the puzzles.
