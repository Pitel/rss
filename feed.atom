        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The hit historical anime The Elusive Samurai wrapped up its first season in Japan, but the fun isn't over just yet. The Elusive Samurai Season 2 is officially coming, though an official release date and synopsis are still under wraps. 


The announcement came in the form of an elegant calligraphy piece by artist Kamari Maeda.




For those unfamiliar, The Elusive Samurai is based on Yusei Matsui’s manga. The manga runs in Shueisha’s Weekly Shonen Jump and is available in English through Viz Media and MANGA Plus. The anime tells the tale of Hojo Tokiyuki, a young noble on the run after the Kamakura shogunate collapses in 1333. Betrayed by Ashikaga Takauji, one of his most trusted vassals, Tokiyuki escapes the bloodshed. With the help of Suwa Yorishige, a wise Shinto priest and lord of Suwa Province, he sets out to reclaim what’s rightfully his using his elusive ways.


CloverWorks produced the first season of the anime, and Aniplex of America licensed the series for North America. Yuta Yamazaki leads the production team as the director, while Yoriko Tomita manages the series composition. Yasushi Nishiya is responsible for the character designs, while Akiyuki Tateyama and GEMBI are behind the captivating soundtrack that brings the world of medieval Japan to life.


The Elusive Samurai's first season can be streamed via Crunchyroll, Disney+, and Netflix, though availability varies per region.

It's been a little over a year since F-Zero 99 shadow-dropped onto Switch and, after receiving a bumper update earlier this month, it looks like Nintendo still has some event ideas up its sleeve.
While digging through the files of the recent 1.5.0 update, dataminer 'LuigiBlood' uncovered references to a Mario vs. Donkey Kong Festival Event — something that might appear a little late, but could just as easily tie in with the platformer's first anniversary in February 2025.

As with the previous couple of Moogle Treasure Trove events, The Hunt for Goetia will be completed via the Mogpendium. This means that, once again, players will have Standard, Weekly, Minimog, and Ultimog challenges to complete…]]></summary>

I imagine that most developers with their fingers in the horror genre would love to get all handsy with what has long been considered one of the pinnacles of the art form. On the other hand, it invites endless scrutiny from its legions of passionate fans, and you will never, ever please everyone.


In fact, attempting to improve on the original is suggesting that it wasn’t already perfect. It wasn’t, but the sentiment is somewhat understandable. Without getting to the most granular of details, it’s hard to tell what compromises the original team had to make and what did and didn’t live up to their visions.

        <updated>2024-10-08T15:53:31.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Good-Feel launched Ganbare Goemon sendup Bakeru on PC and Nintendo Switch in September, and now it's getting a physical release on Switch. Spike Chunsoft unveiled all the details ahead of a February 25, 2025 launch in North America and Europe.


From the looks of it, this is going to be a pretty straightforward physical release, but it's nice to know we're getting one either way. There's very little in the way of bells and whistles outside of the novelty of having Bakeru on a cute little Switch cartridge. Those who pick it up will also get a double-sided A3 paper poster, though. Like the digital version, the physical version of Bakeru will run you a cool $39.99 when it launches. 


Bakeru doesn't appear to be listed in the US store just yet, but it's currently up for pre-order via the Spike Chunsoft UK and EU stores.

With Etsunobu Ebisu producing and Tadanori Tsukawaki directing, Bakeru is colorfully described as part of the "Japan-esque Wild Action" genre. If that doesn't get you excited, nothing will, and the results have proven to be reasonably solid. Even if it doesn't hit the same highs as many of the entries in Konami's classic Goemon series, it manages to serve up a boisterous love letter to Japan in the process.


The more games we can get out of the digital-only doldrums the better. Hopefully Bakeru has been successful enough for Spike Chunsoft to warrant a revisiting, or at least another crack at a Goemon successor. If we get another entry in the lauded Japan-esque Wild Action genre out of it, we'll consider it time well spent.

Gliding in Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is done by summoning particular Echoes and then holding on to them while walking off a cliff. While this sounds like a scary thought, the Echo will keep you aloft and gently lower you down towards the ground. This can be particularly useful when exploring the Eldin Volcano or Hebra Mountain.

Where to Find Heroes World Trello Link


Unfortunately, the Trello link for Heroes World doesn't exist. While that's not ideal, there's always a chance some player will create an unofficial Trello board or Wiki page, at least until developers jump in. With lots of new content coming to this Roblox experience, it's safe to say that Trello is becoming a necessity. The good news is that you don't need this board to get free rewards; just visit our Heroes World codes page.


What is the Heroes World Discord Link?


The Heroes World Discord server is your main source of information for this My Hero Academia-inspired game. This server has many channels, but I advise you to focus on the #announcement channel. Here, you'll learn more about the latest game updates, such as the All For One + Jungle Zone update. You'll spend a lot of time in the #general channel, as that's your go-to place for chatting with other players.


How to use Discord


Screenshot by Destructoid


To maximize your experience, download the Discord app and create an account. These steps are necessary for the verification process. After you complete all requirements, you'll get access to all Heroes World Discord channels. If you use Discord on a PC, it's much easier to browse all available servers and channels. The mobile app is also a good choice, especially for chatting.


While the Heroes World Trello link may be useful, you can learn much from our guide Quirk Tier List here on Destructoid.

Xilonen is shaping up to be an incredibly strong support for Pyro, Hydro, Electro, and Cryo teams. Xilonen’s flexibility and ease of use in Genshin Impact teams definitely make her worth your pulls. Even at Constellation 0 with 4-star weapons (Favonius Sword or Flute of Ezpitzal), she can enable your team to hit for bigger numbers while simultaneously keeping them alive.

While the company's core business in grand strategy remains prosperous, their approach to games outside this niche has been mired by delays, cancelations, closures and layoffs. Let's run through the big setbacks: The Lamplighters League, which we overall liked, was a $22 million financial flop - Paradox have now parted ways with creators Harebrained Studios. Cities Skylines 2 should have been a victory lap, after the success of the first game, but it launched with severe bugs and performance issues. Prison Architect 2, another follow-up to a hit game, has been delayed indefinitely, and Paradox have split from developers Double Eleven. Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is borderline vapourware: originally announced in 2019 with Hardsuit Labs at the helm, it's currently in the hands of The Chinese Room, and was recently delayed for the umpteenth time into 2025.
And then there's the abrupt cancellation of Life By You, a life management sim designed to compete directly with The Sims 4, and the closure of its creators Paradox Tectonic. Writing-down the development of Life By You cost Paradox around 208 million krona, or $19.2 million. It was the primary contributor to a 90% decrease in the company's operating profit for the second quarter of 2024, versus the same quarter in 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Manhwa's rise in popularity granted its reader base access to a slew of titles, and this demand in turn prompted more narratives to be written. However, it's not all pros. The more series are released, the harder it becomes to stand out. And so, common tropes from successful series are frequently adapted, resulting in saturation. Regression manhwa is a good example of that. 


Much like tower climbing and transmigration, there is no shortage of manhwa utilizing this trope. Certainly, not all of them utilize the trope well — at least, not enough to be considered masterpieces. As such, here are 10 regression manhwa that are worth reading.

Remember earlier this year when SEGA announced the strangely Fall Guys-esque free-to-play mobile game Sonic Rumble? Yeah, we do too (unfortunately), but today, we've learnt a little more about the game, making it appear somewhat more attractive: namely, there will be no gacha or pay-to-win mechanics (thanks, VGC).
That is according to Sonic Team head Takashi Iizuka and the game's director Makoto Tase who, in a recent interview with Automaton, explained how the team opted against the mechanics due to how poorly received they tend to be in the West.

Just a few weeks back, I decided the time was right to give Warframe a shot once more. Full disclosure: I'm very familiar with the game due to spending just under three thousand hours playing it. I did stop a while back, but now that I'm more-or-less done with Destiny 2 as well, I felt it might've been good to check what Digital Extremes had been up to.

Why is Roblox Paradox Offline?

You can't play Roblox Paradox, as the game is back in development. Many reasons forced developers to take down the game and return to work. While the game's launch regarding player count was promising, it was soon apparent that changes were necessary. Let's just mention a couple of reasons why you can't play Paradox at the moment:

It's a 1993 range of Super Mario Bros. 2 figures that are stealing the spotlight this time, with five new designs featuring Birdo, Shy Guy, Ninji, Mouser and Wart. As was the case with Keshi Corner's previous collections, these figures would be a difficult find today, but their 3D scans are now available on the Internet Archive for home printing or more general preservation.

That’s a recipe for an SSD upgrade, and if it’s space you’re after, then Amazon Prime Big Deal Days has the 4TB Crucial P3 Plus on some big discounts.

For a brief moment yesterday, it appeared that Tomonobu Itagaki's game studio had been dissolved. But fear not, the Devil's Third creator still has his dev team, albeit under a slightly different name (thanks, Gematsu).
A company dissolution notice was published in Japan's government gazette yesterday, with the Gematsu translation reading as follows: "Dissolution Notice:  has been dissolved, so if you have any claims against our company, please submit your claims within two months from the day this notice is published".

While obtaining pre-war nuclear launch codes was a privilege only a few in the world had, the post-apocalyptic wasteland hands out codes as if they were phone numbers. If you're looking to leave a radioactive scar upon Earth yourself, you're gonna need to know what Nuke Codes are currently active.

You would have to ask him or the psychiatrist he badly requires. And it's unlikely he'd explain himself. This isn't the type of story in which the protagonist has difficulty accepting the existence of horrors, nor struggles with the surreality of what he needs to do to get through a locked door. In the opening minutes, James finds a well with a glowing red square floating inside, stares into it (it saves your game), then makes a calm remark about the odd sensation he feels, and moves on. The human corpses that pepper the town of Silent Hill are noticeably that of James himself, his head bludgeoned and bloodied beyond recognition but his jacket and boots unmistakable. He makes no remark on this. It's probably nothing.

However, the new expansion is giving players an Unable to find a valid license for Diablo IV error at launch. Here is how to fix the Unable to find a valid license for Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred at launch time.


How to fix Unable to find a valid license for Diablo IV


In order to fix the Unable to find a valid license for Diablo IV error that's occurring at the launch of Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred, you're just going to have to hang tight and wait it out. Unfortunately, Blizzard issued a last-minute slight delay for the highly anticipated expansion, indicating the company needs additional time to ensure a simultaneous launch across platforms.




According to Diablo Global Director of Community Adam Fletcher, the goal is still to launch this evening and he anticipates a delay of no more than a couple of hours. At approximately 7pm EST, Adam indicated that the login servers were locked and that Steam players could now download the 2.0.2 patch for launch.


Until the servers come back online, and Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred officially launches, you will not be able to login to access the game and will continue to receive errors such as Unable to find a valid license.


We will update this post in realtime throughout the evening as we join you in the excitement for the first Diablo 4 expansion launch! What class do you plan to go first? Spiritborn, right?

To be perfectly frank, there are a lot of reasons why a Destiny player might be getting excited about Revenant. Between Onslaught updates, the removal of content time-gating, and a whole suite of cool new weapons and armor, Revenant is already looking mighty fine. If all of those things didn't sell you on it, though, Bungie's new trailer may well do so.

They’re not quite mini-games, even if some are quite simple and short, but rather, they’re full nouveau retro games that you get to dig through.


While fictional, the games are assigned a release date from 1983 to 1989 and are depicted with similar limitations to game development standards at the time. In this way, it provides a similar experience to actually digging through a real console, publisher, developer, or genre’s back catalog.

Chasca the Anemo archer


If you’ve played through the first couple of Archon Quests in Natlan, then you’ve already met Chasca. She’s a Bow user from the Flower-Feather tribe, which represents the Anemo element. Apparently, Chasca was raised by Saurians, resulting in a combative nature. When she was found and adopted by a human family, Chasca had to learn how to navigate human interactions in a more peaceful manner. Now, Chasca embraces her role as Peacemaker, resolving tribal conflicts wherever they may arise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you have a PlayStation console (either PS4 or PS5) and have not played Kojima's Death Stranding yet, Best Buy has an amazing deal for you.


Ahead of the festive season, you can make the masterpiece your own for a bargain price. The Standard Edition, originally priced at $39.99, is now $30 cheaper. You can make it yours by just paying $9.99. In terms of discount on offer, it's certainly one of the cheapest prices of all time.


Is the Death Stranding Sale on Best Buy worth buying?


In one word - yes. Death Stranding is a kind of video game that might not be suitable for everyone. It's not a typical run-of-the-mill RPG with a linear system. Instead, it's an amazing experience where you'll have to enjoy everything that's happening around you.


The Standard Edition has a few shortcomings compared to the more expensive Director's Cut. To get the Director's Cut, you'll have to shell out $40 extra, as you'll have to get it at $49.99. At $9.99, it certainly allows you to experiment as well. Even if you don't like Death Stranding after playing the game, you've only spent a fraction of its original price.




Additionally, Death Stranding 2 is in the making, and it's set for a release in the future. We have no idea as to what the exact storyline will be, but there's confirmation about it being a sequel. There's no better way to set yourself up for it than to play the first title. With the Best Buy deal and a festive season coming up, there's no better time to grab your copy of Death Stranding on PlayStation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In an unexpected crossover, music channel Lofi Girl and Alien Isolation have released a lo-fi collab based on the fan-favorite game. During the Halloween season, you can now listen to some chill music inspired by the horror title while studying or working. 


Lofi Girl Alien Isolation collab's taken some by surprise


This is "a collab I was not at all expecting," said YouTube user @Owlgineer with the top-rated comment. "At least now I can vibe out while hiding from Xenomorphs."




It may seem like a strange collab out of the blue, but it has been published on SEGA's YouTube channel as part of the publisher's 10th anniversary celebrations for the hit horror game. "Put on your headphones and relax through space… but don't forget to check your motion tracker," warns SEGA in the video's description. HoKø has created the music, which successfully chills you but at the same time, maintains its horror-like essence with odd atmospheric sounds sprinkled in.


SEGA also announced on Monday that an Alien Isolation sequel is in the works. The creative director Al Hope returns with the game's original studio Creative Assembly back to develop the title. It's currently in early development. "We look forward to sharing more details with you when we're ready," said Hope in a social media message released Monday. 


Alien Isolation is a beloved horror game from 2014 that has high critical praise. It has an 81 Top Critic rating on OpenCritic. "Isolation has some flaws, but it’s faithful to the film series, and I’d love to see a follow-up with a few extra alien evolutions," said our 8.5/10 review from Destructoid's Editor-in-Chief Chris Carter, who will likely get his wish.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Throne and Liberty is currently one of the biggest games on Steam, but an issue has been ruining the otherwise great experience to a lot of players. I'm talking about of "Different Milestones", an ominous and mysterious message that shows up before players get barred from joining one of the game's servers. What's that all about?


"Different Milestones" pertains to a problem stemming from the early access version of the game's integration with the launch version. If you created your character and started your quest during the early access period, you might not be able to join a server running the final version of the game. That's because some of the milestones you've achieved in the early access period of the game are not compatible with the launch server.


Image via Reddit


Even worse, some players are complaining that characters created in Launch Servers can join Early Access servers, but won't be able to return to Launch Servers. I do not know if this will happen to all accounts or has to do with the amount of progress achieved, but I advise against risking it for the time being.


To avoid the problem altogether, you should just create a new character in the launch server and avoid ever switching to the old ones. 


This issue is bumming a lot of players, as many paid for early access and already had a lot of progress from the early days of Throne and Liberty. It's possible that Throne and Liberty's devs at NCsoft will at some point fix this issue and allow players to join with their characters made in early access, but there's no guarantee of when or if it will happen.


Issues between early access and final versions aren't unique to Throne and Liberty, but they're a bummer that can totally be prevented. Larian, for example, managed to gracefully avoid similar issues before the release of Baldur's Gate 3

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Throughout Metaphor: ReFantazio’s roughly 80 hours, the RPG’s protagonist carries a novel with him as he travels through the fantastical world of the United Kingdom of Euchronia. The book depicts an idealized metropolis of skyscrapers where equality is written into law. It’s clear this story envisions a pristine…

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graham asked me if I'd discovered what the metaphor in Metaphor: ReFantazio might be, and I replied, "I don't know haha", or something along those lines. Having given it more thought, I think there are two metaphors: 1) It plays quite like Persona. 2) Its story is like a commentary on our society… or something to that effect.
Metaphors aside, though, the game is a gigantic fantasy RPG that's technically better than Persona 5 in a lot of ways. Structurally, it feels less repetitive. It has more animated cutscenes that elevate those key story moments. You can brush aside weaker enemies in real-time combat, rather than face them in tiresome turn-based tangoes. And overall, I think it's the best game Persona or Persona-like Atlus have put out - it really is brilliant. But there's a part of me that feels like it's missing something that'll leave it less ingrained in the memory than Persona 5 once its final chapter has closed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s a genre of lesser fun that only makes itself known to me once I’ve completely given up on enjoying a game in any traditional sense, lurking under the surface like a silly icon on a losing scratchcard. I’ll call it ‘system tourism’ in lieu of something better. It’s not like the actually fulfilling virtual tourism you might do in something like Yakuza’s Kamurocho, where you’re scarfing down deep fried whiskeys, entranced by the lights. It’s more like doing a Google street view tour of Venice’s canals to see if you can spot someone taking a leak off the side of a gondola - hunting for anarchic anomalies because, honestly, the sights just aren’t grabbing you.
At the risk of sounding like some sort of horrible joy-mathematician: My experience with open world zombie survival game Dread Dawn involved precisely two and half discrete instances of fun, plus some additional appreciation for a few genuinely good ambient bits I’ll get into shortly. With a significant overhaul of basically every player interaction Dread Dawn offers - from the abysmally tedious looting to the rusty combat -  it might some day be worth your time. It harbours some incredible ambition, though it’s surrounded by murk and detritus, like a dictatorial rat in a toilet bowl. Mostly, though, I can only give you advance warning to avoid it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My default movement mode in horror games that actually scare me is: meandering. I seek to approach without approaching, scooting back and forth across the path like a stray hamster, worrying at the corners and avoiding clear perspectives of the route ahead, while keeping the route behind me in my peripheral vision. I have been trained to do this especially by Amnesia, where tilting your gaze too decisively at anything nasty drives your character nuts.
Lurks Within Walls has no time for my hamstery antics. Developed by Here Be Monsters, it's a grid- and turn-based first-person dungeon crawler - a long-lost cousin of Etrian Odyssey that has wound up in an asylum jammed with internet cryptids, reminiscent in cinematic texture of F.E.A.R. In keeping with other grid-based dungeon crawlers, it only lets you turn the view by 90 degree angles and travel in straight lines. Going by the demo, it's a promising restraint for a horror game, though they really do need to expand on the combat, which is currently a slight waste of some terrific creature art.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Playing Phoenix Springs feels like David Lynch spliced together the ripped pages of a pulpy sci-fi comic with the storyboards of a broody noir. Its visuals are stark and foreboding, its dialogue delivered in riddles, and its haunting choral music sounds like it's been recorded in a wind tunnel. It’s a point-and-click that calls back to early 90’s Lucas Arts adventure games, and while it shares the same frustrations, the presentation makes it feel entirely contemporary. What begins as a standard detective game - chatting to strangers, rummaging through junk, finding addresses found on the net - soon spirals into something else entirely. I’ve finished it twice and I’m still not sure I totally understand what it all means.

Back in July, Nintendo filed a lawsuit against Modded Hardware — an online store which, as you might expect, sells modded Switch consoles and chips — in its continued attempt to clamp down on piracy. Three months on, the alleged owner of the store, Ryan Daly, has filed his answer to the complaints where he denies any wrongdoing (thanks, TorrentFreak).
According to the complaints, Nintendo and Daly reached an agreement in March 2024 where the latter would stop selling modded consoles and MIG Switches (a card that plays pirated games on un-modded hardware). The agreement was obviously not upheld, leading Nintendo to submit a complaint to a Seattle federal court where Daly is accused of six different charges.

Epic have detailed early plans for Unreal Engine 6, which Sweeney says will combine Unreal Engine with Fortnite's easy-to-use Unreal Editor to create a gigantic, "interoperable" metaverse platform that lets developers sell stuff that can seamlessly be transferred to other games, whether they run on Unreal Engine or not.

Worldle, Octordle, Moviedle, Waffle, Who Are Ya?, Cloudle and many, many more were a gold rush of bandwagon jumpers I was fully onboard with.

Scrambled Maps takes me back to those good old days. It bears little relation to Wordle, but it is a browser-based puzzle game that offers one new challenge each day, and it is just as delightful a distraction.

The platform's failure to cooperate with French authorities appears to have been a significant aggravating factor. The multi-billionaire was eventually released on bail, offering assurances that Telegram would change for the better. Interestingly, reports from France suggest that broadcasters of live sports are already seeing improvements on the piracy front.

Fast forward to today and many games are now "turn-based", from Tactics Ogre Reborn to Age Of Wonders 4 to chess. In celebration of their orderliness, Steam is currently running a turn-based RPG fest featuring discounts and demos for "turn-based games where you grow stronger with every battle".

Neglect to do so, and you'll pop your clogs. It's the kind of mechanical tomfoolery you'd associate with Peter Molydeux, but in this case, it's all the fine work of Stephen's Sausage Roll developer increpare and Quadrant developer undef. The developers have somehow gotten 50 levels out of this meme-ish premise, and it looks like quite an elaborate hop-and-bopper with some less-cheerful political overtones. Here's the trailer.

Knowing Brendy, he'll be sauntering down Neely Street like a gentleman dandy from 1920s Oxford, throwing out his cuffs and elbows and winking merrily at all the shambling depression metaphors who are trying to chew his legs off. While we await his verdict, here's another excerpt from a chat with Bloober earlier this summer, in which I pop the extremely imaginative question of what they'll do after remaking Silent Hill 2. The answer, in brief, is more games with a manual third-person view that rely on ambience, suspense and the thrill of the unknown, rather than monsters going "boo!"

I think the curse has evolved then, as we hadn't even discussed 11 bit's upcoming third-person management adventure The Alters… but Edwin had played it at this year's Geoffcom.

Most of the audience for that screening rocked up fully equipped with suspenders, feather boas, extravagant lipstick, and a cherished selection of deliberately unfunny heckler's lines to deploy at key moments in the movie.
Have you not seen the Rocky Horror Show? It's a wildly camp musical and B-movie homage for stage and screen, in which two homely, heteronormative Americans seek shelter in a castle run by Tim Curry's high-kicking mad scientist Dr Frank-N-Furter. I can't speak for how well it has aged, but it was a hit work of sexual counterculture in the 1970s, and is absolutely Curry's finest hour outside of Command And Conquer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Where's your asthma inhaler? Is it in your hand? Good, because you need it to stay alive in this horror game about getting stalked through metro stations by a tall creep that nobody else on the platform can perceive. Crowded Followed is basically a playable It Follows, the 2014 horror movie and overt metaphor for sexually transmitted disease. Only this time the slow but unstoppable entity is following you because you picked up a mysterious briefcase from a dying man in an alleyway. I thought I told you to stop accepting random bloodsoaked objects from strange men? Quit it! Anyway, there's a demo for it on Steam if you like.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One blemish on Throne and Liberty’s barnstorming release – one day in and it’s so far up the Steam charts it’s only visible by telescope – has been some unexpected Steam Deck trouble. Despite the fantasy MMORPG having worked fine on the Deck in previous betas, a celebrating Amazon employee must have drunkenly nudged the 'Break game on Linux' lever at the office launch party, as reports began trickling in of handheld players being kicked from servers. The cause: Easy Anti-Cheat, Throne and Liberty’s hacker thwarter of choice, declaring an error.
Fortunately, as of right now (October 2nd), all seems well again – I’ve got Throne and Liberty running on a Steam Deck OLED as I type this, and can mosey around next to fellow online players without issues. A lot of them are turning into wolves. Most of them, in fact. Maybe too many.

There's an Ashkenazi rabbi, a Saxon serf, some French knights, a Czech spy, a German dwarf, and a pair of inseparable Italian peasants. This rowdy band of roustabouts I've collected in the Crusader Kings 3's Roads To Power expansion has the feeling of a found family, each fellow wanderer sporting their own ambitions and quirks. They won't all make it. Many of the people I'm looking at in the glow of these embers will fall on the road, victims of robbery, landslides, and animal attacks. One of them will sacrifice their life to save the rest of us. All will bring me a step closer to my goal: I am walking from Ireland to China.

It's sitting just behind Black Myth: Wukong at number six at time of writing, which is sort of like getting the wobbly chair at a lavish dinner party. Sure, you’re 5% certain you’re going to break your neck at some point, but you’re still eating smoked salmon and chortling, so it’s a good evening. It had a beta earlier this year, which looks like it’s gone some way to drum up serious interest. It’s still not quite on Banana's level, mind.

Having basically sold both of my best standing legs to buy more Kingdom Death Monster expansions, I can’t bemoan anyone spending silly amounts of money on whatever plastic tat makes them happy. But I love Baldur’s Gate 3, and it makes me sad to see all the wonderful art, writing, and acting that went into its characters reduced to $6 miniatures that look like their limbs would melt if I rubbed them between my thumb and forefinger.
As spotted by PC Gamer, WizKids have recently opened pre-orders for a set of greasy pre-painted fetishes based on Larian’s RPG. WizKids, of course, being the maker of supermarket-discount-aisle-ass toys but, ah, they’ve got a base on them so we can pretend they’re proper models and charge you accordingly. Moaning about toys now, are we Nic? Is this what the profession has been reduced to? And to that I say: videogames are toys anyway, they’re just slightly better at hiding it. Also, several of them are worth owning.

Will it build on the exciting innovations of Lords Of The Fallen, or will it seek to recapture the nostalgic charms of Lords Of The Fallen? Perhaps in ten years time we'll do a list feature, "Lords Of The Fallen Games Ranked", with just one entry. I'm pretty sure that in 10 years time, generative AI plagiarism will have rendered everything interchangeable anyway.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I do not wish to dwell overly long on the incredible stop motion sheep in the trailer for folk horror game Daemonologie, because it’s got so much else going for it - from the gorgeously haunting vocal and string melodies to the extremely dark character interactions that offer your witch finder the choice between 'talk' and 'torture'. And yet, living in Wales for the last decade must have rubbed off. The sweet sheep, they sing to me. The relative rarity of stop motion and other practical effects in horror media is surely one of the greater tragedies of our age, although not too surprising given the incredible amount of work it takes. Flock toward the trailer below, and I’ll see you on the other side of the pasture, hopefully as deeply altered by the experience as I was.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am puzzled by Ara Colon History Untold's priorities. At its heart are a couple of interesting ideas undermined by its own determination to put the wrong thing on centre stage. Make a rich and elaborate resource management game with an unorthodox research system, but then spend so much time on a simultaneous turn system and detailed animations that you're left with a cumbersome interface and lifeless AI, and you too might wind up making Ara.
There's an almost great game here, but it's all neglected and bruised from being shoved into the packaging of a lacklustre 4X.

And being one of RPS' foremost Yakuza sickos, I can say that I remain cautious about it, with perhaps a hint of optimism. It doesn't look like it's going for goofy, but instead opting for largely gritty and serious and almost entirely unrelated to the Yakuza games. Still, though, I do know how the show ends. It's really obvious, actually, when you think about it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wild-eyed stickman brawler Judero appears to have kicked off a small wave of pagan-themed games - or rather, it has recalibrated my brain to be more aware of pagan-themed games. The latest to catch my fancy is party-based RPG Banquet For Fools, out in Early Access today with a demo. Created by two-person Hannah and Joseph Games, it casts you as one of the Vollings - a race of gaunt elven humanoids, hailing from the same school of manky action-figure as Judero, who have been shunned by their gods and have accordingly turned to paganism. 


Specifically, you're a lord who has set up a spice farm on a "cursed" island, the former home of a long-dead civilization. This certainly sounds like a foolish thing to do, and it's no huge surprise that everybody on your farm has gone missing. So off you trot with a team of four custom-generated companions to solve the mystery, and also make up gnarly spells by daubing your blood on trees.

I’ve brought an utterly improbable Champions League title to Aston Villa, built an enviable Ultimate Team and developed a formation that keeps at least outright humiliation at bay in online matches… And yet, my heart isn’t bursting with the joy of joga bonito. This must be how Guardiola feels, popping onto the pitch to celebrate his annual Prem title with the latest batch of ruthlessly efficient, lab-grown wonderkids and pushing down the feeling that this one doesn’t feel quite as special as the first.
That is to say, EA Sports FC25 is a bit like FC24. Which was quite a lot like FIFAs 21-23, which had a lot in common with the FIFAs our ancient ancestors used to play by the fireside in their primitive tribal dwellings. There are noticeable additions - particularly new tactics controls and a 5v5 Rush mode - and I’m glad they’re here. But as much as they contribute towards a continuously compelling suite of foot-to-ball, they can’t quite dislodge the nagging feeling that this shouldn’t be an annual, full-price release anymore.

It also made me go “ugh” once, because I opted against tank controls, despite the suggestion to use them with mouse and keyboard. I come to you as disembodied voice, trapped between the worlds of video game inputs, with a dire plea: don’t do that. Just use tank controls. I’d restart but I’m already in too deep.

These pitches included WarCraft 4, as you'd expect, and also a Call Of Duty RTS, as you'd probably also expect, though seemingly no new StarCraft.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A court in Greece has handed down one of the most punishing sentences on record to a man who resold pirate IPTV subscriptions. The Court of Thessaloniki heard that the local man sold subscriptions to thousands of customers, generating millions of euros. After the court sent him to prison for eight years, attention now turns to a seized customer database. The authorities are said to be preparing cases against customers, some of whom have already been arrested.

I’m currently reading Brendan Keogh’s The Videogame Industry Does Not Exist. It’s interesting enough that I’m only mildly pissed off about the added academic book tax. Paying the academic price is funny if you say it like paying the iron price. Although, again, not quite funny enough to soothe my awful uni flashbacks of books that cost a week’s worth of groceries each. This week, it’s writer on Tomb Raider, Mirror's Edge, BioShock Infinite plus loads more, and host of BBC Radio’s Mythical Creatures - Rhianna Pratchett! Cheers Rhianna!

I still think the guard are more interesting, but it's a very fun bit of smashy.

Tellingly, this only came to the forefront after a 17-year-old developer put together an unofficial transparency portal.

The maximum cabaret? Madness! Delightful madness! Here's the trailer for Clowned King, the next game from Moonana, developer of the colourful and melodious Keylocker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The beauty of cards is that they can be anything. You can slap together a working game with them in a couple of minutes. Take 12 blanks, doodle some faces and landscapes, and lo, you have a procedural narrative generator. Make some duplicates, invent a few rules and lo, you have systems. 


Conversely, the great drawback of cards - especially in those roguelite deckbuilders people have been churning out since Slay The Spire - is that everything can be reduced to them. For example: last night, I played a round of Fungi with my partner, Fungi being a charming tabletop foraging sim in which you gather scrumptious chantarelles and boletus from the forest floor. This morning I resumed playing Breachway, out now in early access, in which you guide a starship through a series of wartorn solar systems, with battles unfolding as a turn-based exchange of cards corresponding to ship components.

The Razer Wolverine V3 Pro (and its wired cousin, the Wolverine V3 Tournament Edition) has looked to desktop peripherals in search of superior button-bashing, cannibalising the rather good Razer Viper gaming mouse series for its switches. The result is a high-performing, satisfyingly clicky pad that, yes, works wonderfully on PC – albeit one that rinses you for four times(!) as much as a standard Xbox controller.

The second tool I obtained was a trumpet. It doesn’t really work like a trumpet, and it does things no regular trumpet could or should do. I got a trowel next. Here’s the thing about the trowel: it’s a pretty good trowel. Nothing fancy. But recently, I keep digging up… objects. Objects most peculiar. I’ve got the weekend to sort this garden, and a cosy little shed to sleep in, so I really should just get on with it. Again, though, I must reiterate: I keep digging up… objects.
I go to clean some rubbish from the bathroom. I interact with the mirror and the game says: “You do not see anything in the mirror”. I take a note that says: I do not see anything in the mirror. I check the game again and no, I still do not see anything in the mirror. Sure it’s fine. Just a shit mirror, probably. They should get it replaced. What good is a mirror you can’t see anything in?

If you were serious about that moral, Hirogami, you'd actually be printed on hammered-down treemulch. I decry thee, pretender! You're one of the very electronic critters you want me to battle. On the other hand, you do let me transform into an origami armadillo which can roll around like a pinball. Here's the announcement trailer.

Proposed amendments to the 'Piracy Shield' law state that, if any network service provider even suspects criminal activity, they must immediately report to the authorities. This includes search engines, DNS and VPN providers, reverse proxy servers, internet security platforms.  Failure to report or even a delay in reporting would be punishable by up to a year in prison.

Enter Junxions, a traffic engineering game which focuses entirely on the simulation and construction of roads, railways, and pedestrian walkways, right down to the coding of the traffic lights. It's aiming for a 2025 release and you'll find its trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During his tenure as the foremost newsperson of the 1980s, Atari's Paperboy faced many grievous challenges - squabbling drunks, swarms of bees, the actual Grim Reaper - and yet, day after day he answered the noble call of journalism, lashing his basket to his doughty BMX and daring the treacherously oblique suburbs of Reaganite America. 


Speaking as both a news editor and a former paperboy, who broke his mind and body hauling obese Sunday editions to the millionaire houses at the top of the valley, Paperboy is my role model. Or he would be if my role model weren't actually Steven Spielberg's Freakazoid. Paperboy's heyday has long since passed into history, however, and the business of journalism has changed beyond recognition. People don't read newspapers anymore, they just eat pizza. This, at least, is the condensed analysis offered by Food Boy, which launched this week on Steam.

It’s partly a story about mental health, partly about the absolute horror of not just managing a Sim but actually being one, and partly about seeing how many wanks and cheese sandwiches you can fit into a single morning. Yes, I washed my hands afterward. Ah, but after which?

Alice B (RPS in peace) dedicated an article series to it back in 2019, summarising it as "a sad, quiet, meditative game about breathing and loneliness and drawing pictures in the stars". Stone's forthcoming Known Mysteries is a ritual of the sun, I guess. Slated for launch on 23rd October, it's the first of several, creatively low-carbon projects that will run off a custom, solar-powered server Stone has set up on her apartment balcony in Calgary, Canada.

For those who don't know the game, this third-person helljaunt sees its players wandering through the battlefields of an endless conflict between three major world powers. Mechs stomp past you, ignoring you in favour of decimating enemy soldiers. Bug-like drones hover overhead, scanning for prey. And horrifying mommy harvesters scavenge bodies from the debris. As a collection of imagery, it's powerful stuff. As a game that you can play (with up to three pals) it is very rough, and not just around the edges.

I'm glad, so here's another. Cold And Afraid is a murder mystery that aims to channel the 1990s with chunky characters and lots of lovely dithering. You play a detective out to stop a serial killer with a grisly pattern who's preying on the young women of an unnamed US city. On top of the obligatory tank controls, it aims to have "consequential dialogue choices" and a "Time Event system where you must meet certain people at specific times to forward different story threads". Ah, forgive me, you're here to see the chunky limbs. Here's a recent trailer that shows 'em.
