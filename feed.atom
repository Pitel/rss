It would be another nine years before Expend4bles shook things up with a new title format but little else had changed. Expendables movies come with a three-point guarantee: lots of explosions, a solid 6/10 aggregate score on the Internet Movie Database, and thousands of people being monitored on BitTorrent so they can be sued at a later date.

In The Final Shape, Guardians will travel into the Traveler to battle The Witness and prevent it from doing what it's been trying to wreak havoc on the universe, as it's been trying to do ever since Destiny was initially released.

It was announced as being in development on May 1, 2024, but it didn't even last the rest of the month before EA and PopCap stepped in to put a stop to it.

Offline mode is finally coming to Nightingale, which should mean an end to the server woes which plagued the game soon after release.

At the core of MTG lies its greatest feature known as the Stack which plays a crucial role in determining how spells are resolved. 


Becoming an expert on the Stack isn’t necessary to enjoy MTG, but knowing the basics will set you apart from other players regardless of what deck archetype you play with. With a little knowledge, you can look at a sequence of cards and understand the order in which they play out along with the board state afterward. This guide will serve as an introduction to the Stack and the various spells and actions that it applies (or doesn’t apply) to.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rainbow Six Siege: Operation New Blood is the game's second season for its ninth year. It looks back at the game's past to make old Operators more viable while providing meaningful updates that will make the game healthier and offer more to seasoned veterans and newcomers. 


Operation New Blood doesn't bring a fancy new Operator to the table in Rainbow Six Siege. Instead, it goes right back to the beginning, to an Operator that's more of a meme than anything else and transforms them into a viable character you can take into any match. Ubisoft invited me to a press briefing on the new season to show me what it's all about, and I'm confident everyone, whether you're brand new to the game or have played since day one, will appreciate the impact it's going to have.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Steven Erikson's Malazan Book of the Fallen is one of the most sprawling fantasy sagas ever written. The plot unfolds over thousands of years, documenting the expansive and turbulent history of the Malazan Empire through the perspectives of a vast cast of rich characters. 


As you can probably tell, the Malazan series has a gigantic scope, making it tricky for new readers to know which book to read first. Fortunately, the saga is broken into five sub-series, making it slightly easier to decipher where each book falls on the timeline.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The only correct answer to the age-old question, "Who doesn't love dragons?" is nobody. Almost every culture has at least one story about a dragon or dragon-adjacent creature, and those myths have inspired countless fantasy writers to tell their own stories about the most iconic creature in all of folklore.


Fantasy writers have penned hundreds of dragon-themed fantasy novels over the years, and I've read a good chunk of them. As a self-taught dragon expert, I am qualified to talk about the pieces of draconic literature that soar above their competition. Here are my picks for the top 10 fantasy books about dragons.

This left fans like me in the lurch, but Google has provided a way for us to make our controllers useful forever. However, time is running out to do so, as we've got to do it before the end of 2024. 


If you turn on Bluetooth mode for your Stadia controller, you can use it with your computer and fondly remember the time when it was possible to stream games to pretty much any screen with great quality visuals and responsive controls. Even if all you do is dig out your controller now to turn the mode on and forget about it for a few years, you'll always have the option to use it in the future when you want something less bulky than a wireless Xbox controller.

Eiichiro Oda is a genius when it comes to lore development, so much so that new revelations often give rise to a slew of new questions. At least, that's usually the case.


With the series entering its final arc, Oda is starting to drop one big revelation after another, such as the ever-elusive Dr. Vegapunk finally making his appearance. But despite the consecutive lore dumps, there remain multiple unanswered mysteries, such as these.

As it is with many newly launched games, Hades 2 is no outlier to busted items. The game is in Early Access, so it's likely we'll see buffs and nerfs to weapons, items, boons, and other upgrades while it's in development. But until then, there are a few boons you should seek out before they're changed (if they get changed).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Team Ladybug has shown that it knows how to craft a solid Metroidvania with games like Record of Lodoss War: Deedlit in Wonder Labyrinth and Touhou Luna Nights. The studio is almost ready to return to the exploratory genre with Blade Chimera, but a delay has moved it out of its previously planned spring release window.


With spring off the table, we'll have to switch gears and look ahead to August 2024. There's also a demo on the way as part of June's Steam Next Fest event. For now, you can see more footage in the new trailer from the WSS playground below. 




So far, Blade Chimera looks like it ticks all the right Metroidvania boxes. There seem to be varied areas to explore, little weirdos to meet, and plenty of bizarre enemies that somehow manage to peacefully co-exist in the same hallways. You can also apparently control a dog, slice through little chimps, and battle colossal alligators. There's even an extremely Belmont-like swinging mechanic on display in the trailer.  


Blast from the past

There are also, naturally, lost skills for the Demon Hunter known as Shin to acquire. Just as genre legend Samus foretold, Shin will gradually reclaim these skills as he progresses. He'll also hopefully learn more about his own lost memories and discover the whereabouts of his missing wife while fighting alongside the Missa Association to take the world back from demons. 


Shin's amnesiac ways aren't just a convenient means of explaining his initial lack of abilities. He can also use his demon blade to pull other things in from the past, including platforms that pave the way to new areas. It's all delivered with the detailed sprite work we've come to expect from Team Ladybug, so if waiting a little longer is what it takes, that's more than fine. When Blade Chimera eventually launches — fingers crossed for August — it will be available on Nintendo Switch and PC via Steam.

Game File journalist Stephen Totilo broke the story, revealing Bungie's win, which amounts to $63,210 in damages. The real win, though, is the precedent this case sets. Other devs can now point to a case where a jury has voted in favor of a game developer regarding cheats being made for their games. 


Though the win was in Bungie's favor, the case wasn't without its twists. James May, who Bungie alleged it caught reverse-engineering Destiny 2 to make cheats, claimed that he didn't infringe Bungie's copyright. I…]]></summary>

However, some issues persist, and players have found that one of the strangest bends bullet arcs if you jump too much. 


Jump spamming is a pretty big problem in XDefiant at the moment. A player's hitbox seems to become smaller or just harder to hit with gunfire when they're moving, so you can be almost invincible if you sprint for the perfect amount of time. Jumping works a treat, too, but now that appears to have its own problem, and it is bizarre. Not only does it increase your crosshair size, it makes shotgun bullets fly sideways out of the barrel.

The series started its engine way back in 1979 with director George Miller's Mad Max. Since then, it has become a multimedia juggernaut recognized the world over and beloved for its unique look and many weird and wild characters.


At the same time, just because it has a colorful cast and a sprawling world doesn't mean the Mad Max franchise is perfect. The lore and overall timeline is a bit confusing, and there's a lot of ground to cover with ancillary media like novels, video games, and comics. Therefore, it can appear daunting for those new to Miller's post-apocalyptic creation.

How would you feel if the next mainline Fire Emblem game was exclusively a social sim?
While a change this drastic is almost certainly not in the cards, the identity crisis currently faced by Fire Emblem means that change must come. While Engage’s 1.61 million sales as of March 2023 is respectable for the franchise, it marks a return to 3DS-era numbers after whispers of blockbuster status when Three Houses sold nearly 3 million in its first fiscal year. The reason for this discrepancy is simple: Three Houses expanded the fanbase by shifting the focus away from its strategy elements, whereas Engage doubled down on its strategy roots.

PLAYISM and WSS Playground have announced that the upcoming pixel art Metroidvania title Blade Chimera will be launching on the Switch this coming August.

What do you get when you combine Super Mario Odyssey, Geometry Wars, Disney Pixar, and Genesis Noir? You get Hauntii, a twin-stick shooter, puzzle-platformer, and adventure game from tiny development studio Moonloop Games. An unexpected mixture, to be sure — but that's what indie games are all about, and we're always down for a new genre mash-up.
The story is the part that reminds us of Pixar — and, considering their mastery of storytelling, it's no bad thing. You awake as a small black smudge of a wisp with no memories, in a monochromatic world you don't recognise. A being with long, flowing hair in a white robe — an angel, perhaps — appears to guide you through the world, out of this wilderness and into the light, but you are dragged to the ground once more, chained down, unable to break free. Now, you'll have to venture through the land of the dead, slowly piecing together your life and your afterlife, and breaking those chains through self-discovery.

Then, thanks to services like the Virtual Console, you could emulate those old games without having to own any old consoles, for much more affordable prices (usually) than the ones you might find in secondhand sales.

The Taskmasters themselves, Greg Davies and Alex Horne, will be represented in-game, and Horne, who created the concept of the show and is technically its sole writer (see below) was available to chat about it. We learned about the upcoming VR game (releasing June 13 on Quest), why the American Comedy Central version of the show didn't work, whether or not it is time to give an American version another shot, and what it is like to meet yourself in VR.

Capcom has updated the 'Platinum Titles' page via its investors portal - that is, every game that's sold at least 1 million copies since launch - and a new entry on the list is the Nintendo Switch version of Resident Evil 6.
Originally launched in 2012 and ported to the Switch in October 2019, Resident Evil 6 proved to be pretty divisive among fans of the series: many praised the game for its fluid combat and extensive Mercenaries mode, while others thought it strayed too far from the franchise's survival-horror roots.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lovely questions, lovely people.
It's now well over seven years since Nintendo launched the Switch and with the console now well into its eighth year — and with official confirmation that a new hardware announcement is coming soon(ish) — we thought it was a great time to look back over the generation and collect some stats about how you, our lovely readers, use the system in 2024 and if it's changed at all since 2017.
Enter the Nintendo Switch Summer Survey 2024. We're planning to send out a series of Switch-related questions in survey form in the next week or so, the results of which we'll share in an article at a later date. All the questions will be optional and the results totally anonymous — it should give us all a fascinating picture of how we're using our Switches all these years after launch.

In his latest YouTube video, Masahiro Sakurai highlights boss battles in Nintendo games as being similar to tutorials, noting that he prefers games that offer up more strategic freedom.
Aptly titled Madatory Strategy and Strategic Balance, the video dives into the difference between boss fights that require a set strategy to overcome with those that allow the player to experiment with different weapons and tactics.

For third-party Switch pads, it can be difficult to stack up against Nintendo's official offering. The problem is that the Pro Controller packs in so many features that it feels like something's missing as soon as we play without them.
Motion controls, HD rumble, built-in NFC amiibo reader, a 40-hour battery life. It's a pretty enviable list, no? One thing that the Pro Controller does not offer, however, is a novelty figurine in the handle. This is the category where PDP's REALMz Wireless Controller triumphs. It just so happens that it is the only category where this third-party option takes the win.

We're not going to talk about any of that hoity-toity quantum wheeling-and-dealing in this piece, however. We're going to talk about the fact that the opening stretch reminded me of Gears Of War and the many over-the-shoulder adventures it has influenced. I'm sorry. It's been a complicated week involving minimal sleep, and I no longer have the grey cells for branching timelines, though they are certainly the more fascinating aspect of this game.

There’s Deathbulge of course, but also the upcoming Anger Foot, Abiotic Factor, and a load more I’m sure. There was also literally Door Kickers, but that was ages ago. Anyway, the latest game to put a hinge-disrespecting protagonist front and center is also my current obsession: the excellent Post Void/Hotline Miami-type beat, Mullet Mad Jack. It’s a very fast, very silly FPS about shooting robot billionaires that takes its aesthetic from 80’s anime and PC-98 games. I’m not sure what else you need, honestly.

Every so often, I see a premise for a game that really grabs me. The Alters is the latest with its unique take on the "what if" questions and multiverses. What starts as seemingly a standard survival game set on a hostile alien planet quickly introduces enticing base-building mechanics and a fun premise of escaping an ever-encroaching deadly sunrise. But it's the unique idea of the main character not only learning how different his life would have been had he made different choices at pivotal moments in his past but also being able to meet and work alongside those versions of hi…]]></summary>

If you cast your mind back to earlier in the year, you might remember the horrors of the GameStop-exclusive Banjo-Kazooie Funko Pop.

Now, Funko has revealed another Banjo-Kazooie Pop figure. Sure, all of the horrifying details are still present and correct — seriously, what horrors have those eyes seen? — but, again, it's new Banjo merch!

In a dark, futuristic world, being a superhero has been outlawed. Not by the government, but by the only force in King City that matters – The Company. Capes takes the turn-based strategy genre and gives it a comic book feel, putting you in the control of a fledgling group of superheroes trying to dish out justice in a city where justice doesn’t exist. While some of its visuals lack a bit of polish, the actual gameplay in Capes is heroic enough to make up for it.
If you throw The Boys and Watchmen into a blender with XCOM 2, what you’d be left with would be Capes. Developer Spitfire Interactive knew exactly the tone it was going for and stuck with it. You start with two superheroes and a grizzled veteran calling the shots from a bunker and slowly assemble a team capable of freeing King City from the grip of The Company, which is so evil it doesn’t need a proper name.

Still, if we take for granted the idea that a review is only really valuable as an insight into the experience of the player: I haven’t been feeling especially great this week. That in mind: Splintered Sea is more Besiege, thoughtfully applied to its already expansive toolkit. More importantly, it's currently bringing me deep and deeply needed moments of untainted, childlike, vaguely-Orkish joy.

I’m usually a lot more suspicious of hardware leaks, which are often just out-of-date or otherwise inaccurate info, but I’ve also sat through enough mic-muted prebriefings to know an official slideshow when I see one, and that appears to be exactly what Videocardz got its hands on. Besides, these specs include a gigantic 80Whr battery upgrade (doubling the ROG Ally’s 40Whr capacity), so we can at least file this under "News James wants to be true."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Videogames and especially role-playing games are chock-full of sheltered upbringings that go tits up. Innocent times and places like the prologue for Baldur's Gate, which unfolds in the vast, fortified monastery of Candlekeep (beware spoilers from this point on).
BioWare's first ever RPG opens with your unsuspecting Chosen One learning the ropes from the old sage Gorion. There are fetchquests that take you around the enormous citadel, bits of combat training to do, cosy formative chinwags to have with characters like your childhood friend Imoen. But it's not to last, of course: Gorion is murdered, and you must rove the Sword Coast in pursuit of his killer. When you return to Candlekeep later in the game, this once-proud bastion of learning has been filled with doppelgangers of Gorion and other acquaintances, a parade of chatbots waiting to stab you in the back.

With pre-orders opening on 31st May 2024 and closing on 30th June 2024, fans will have roughly one month to secure either a Standard Edition of the game or a Collector's Edition. The estimated shipping date is between 11th October - 11th November 2024, but for those who might be opting for a digital copy, it might be best to wait for confirmation from WayForward itself on its release date.

        <updated>2024-05-23T18:10:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year, Game Informer revealed the exclusive first details and screenshots of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed, the video game set after the events of 2023 film, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem. Following that March reveal, developer A Heartful of Games and publisher Outright Games has largely gone quiet. Today, the publisher revealed what players can expect from the Deluxe and Collector's Editions of Mutants Unleashed if they want to splurge on the game when it arrives later this year.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed allows you to take control of the four turtles in a 3D brawler/platformer for up to two players. The premium editions of the game will provide additional physical goodies for fans of the franchise. The Deluxe Edition includes the game, an exclusive steelbook, four pin badges, four keychains, and an artbook. Meanwhile, the Collector's Edition includes the game, Season Pass, pizza van statue, LED sign, five pin badges, four patches, a mouse mat, notebook, pen, artbook, poster, stickers, and a collector's box. The Deluxe Edition retails for $60, while the Collector's Edition will set you back $200.
Oddly enough, both the Deluxe and Collector's Editions are exclusive to the PlayStation 5 and Switch versions of the game. If you're not planning to experience this title on those systems, but still want to at least play through the game, you're in luck, as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleahsed arrives on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC later this year.
For more on Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in video games, be sure to read our in-depth feature on the history of the video game franchise here, and if you want something else to look forward to, read a comment from TMNT co-creator Kevin Eastman on the upcoming video game based on The Last Ronin here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Acquisitions have been rampant in the games industry recently. While the prime example on everyone's mind is likely Xbox's recent acquisition of Activision Blizzard, several have already occurred in 2024. The latest was announced today by Atari, which confirmed it is acquiring its longtime rival, Intellivision.
Atari announced it has purchased the Intellivision brand and more than 200 games from Intellvision Entertainment. As part of the deal, Intellivision Entertainment will rebrand and continue developing and distributing the Amico game console with a license from Atari to distribute new versions of Intellivision games on the console. Atari will also look to expand digital and physical distribution of legacy Intellivision games, potentially create new games, and explore licensing opportunities. 
"This was a very rare opportunity to unite former competitors and bring together fans of Atari, Intellivision, and the golden age of gaming," chairman and CEO of Atari Wade Rosen said in a press release. 
"Atari has been a valuable partner and we have every confidence they will be a responsible steward of the storied Intellvision brand," CEO of Intellivision Entertainment Phil Adam said. "We look forward to our expanded collaboration and bringing a broad array of new Atari and Intellivision titles to the Amico and Amico Home family gaming platforms."
Atari has been experiencing a bit of a re-emergence in the public consciousness lately. In addition to other acquisitions, such as Nightdive Studios and Digital Eclipse, Atari has also published well-received games like Mr. Run and Jump and Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration. For more on Atari's outlook and current strategy, be sure to listen to a 2023 episode of All Things Nintendo, which featured an in-depth conversation with Wade Rosen right here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In an interview with his parent company on Sony.com, Last of Us co-creator Neil Druckmann talks about AI and briefly teases Naughty Dog's next game. Druckmann is expectedly vague about Naughty Dog's next big project but offers an enticing tease, saying, "I'm eager to see how this new game resonates, especially following the success of The Last of Us, as it could redefine mainstream perceptions of gaming."
The interview, however, primarily focuses on technology and how it improves and makes it easier for creators to tell unique stories. Regarding AI, Druckmann says, "AI is really going to revolutionize how content is being created, although it does bring up some ethical issues we need to address. With technologies like AI and the ability to do motion capture right from home, we're reducing both costs and technical hurdles, opening the door for us to take on more adventurous projects and push the boundaries of storytelling in games."
He also briefly touches on the future of The Last of Us TV show, citing that modern technology has allowed him to oversee the TV show's second season remotely from Los Angeles while it shoots in Canada.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Xbox revealed the date of its summer showcase, it included a mysterious teaser. Immediately following the presentation, there will be a second livestream to highlight an upcoming game in a "beloved" series. Today, the subject of that showcase has been revealed, and surprising no one, it's a new Call of Duty game.
Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is a title that might confuse some, seeing as there technically isn't a game titled Black Ops 5. This is because the fifth entry of the sub-series, which launched in 2021, was Black Ops Cold War, temporarily removing the numbered naming convention. The news was announced on social media, but was accompanied by a teaser on YouTube that seems to hint at the events of the game's campaign.


The 40-second clip follows a group of people sneaking onto the top of Mount Rushmore, where they place blindfolds over the eyes of the presidents carved into the mountainside. The first three blindfolds read, "The truth lies," while the fourth features a three-headed wolf logo that was used in the initial redacted teaser of the game.
The game will be revealed in full during a presentation on Saturday, June 9, immediately following the Xbox showcase that will start at 10 AM PT/ 1 PM ET. Microsoft is reportedly debating on whether or not the launch the game on Game Pass.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jason, alongside Agent Smith from The Matrix, had a cameo in the last MultiVersus trailer, but now he is the star. The footage shows off his moveset, like hitting opponents with a machete, collapsing them in a camp bunk bed, and hitting them with a sleeping bag stuffed with the body of another player. You also get a look at at least one of his alternate costumes.


MultiVersus is a free-to-play game and will launch on May 28 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While I’ve always thought the race towards graphical hyperrealism isn’t as pervasive as it's often perceived, Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 is definitely one of those games. The kind that probably has twelve artists dedicated to the recreation of visible pores, that sort of thing. It’s so focused on looking pretty that it hasn’t even noticed the title and subtitle got mixed up.
Sure enough, Hellblade 2 is a harsh test for older hardware, with a heavy reliance on DLSS or FSR upscaling to keep performance sweet. That said, it’s no Dragons Dogma 2-style technical horrorshow either. A happy balance of visuals and smoothness is attainable on plush PCs and low-end laptops alike, while DLSS 3 frame generation can deliver an effective kick in the framerate pants on RTX 40 series GPUs.

This is just one of many laughs your diaphragm will endure as you navigate "the escalating adventures of a girl trying to make zines in a town of giallo-style masked serial murderers". The horror comedy already won its creators the Nuovo Award at the Independent Games Festival this year, recognition that has been a long time coming for prolific game maker Stephen "thecatamites" Gillmurphy. If you're unfamiliar with his work, you can get acquainted next week, when Anthology of the Killer gets its full release on Itch.io on May 28th.  At which point you can explore its unsettling urban hell of shady corporations and cops who think they're cool. There's a trailer below.

As such, I’m accepting defeat. Obviously with apologies to any studious Steam Deck Academy readers.

Lorelei and the Laser Eyes’ setup is bland compared to the others in the puzzle genre. You are a bespectacled woman carrying a clutch who walks with incredible poise into a mansion with little understanding of why you are there or what you are doing. The lack of context doesn’t matter, though, because the game immediately showers you with an incredible sense of mood. You may not know why you are petting the dog in the courtyard, checking every door, or reading every scrap of paper you come across initially, but you want to be there and see everything the game has to offer.

        <updated>2024-05-22T16:34:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’ve known since October 2022 that Season 3 of Netflix’s The Witcher would be actor Henry Cavill’s last as Geralt of Rivia and that Liam Hemsworth would don the silvery mane going forward. Today, Netflix released the first teaser trailer for Season 4 giving fans their first look at Hemsworth in the role.


Unfortunately, Hemsworth doesn’t speak in the brief clip, so we still don’t know how his Geralt voice compares to Cavill’s (or the games, for that matter). But he definitely doesn’t look out of place as the White Wolf and, hopefully, won’t be too much of a distraction in this new season.
Season 4 is currently in production in the UK and will be filmed back-to-back with Season 5, which will also be the show's finale. It has no release date but is speculated to premiere in 2025. These last two seasons will cover the three remaining Witcher books: Baptism of Fire, The Tower of the Swallow, and Lady of the Lake. The returning cast includes Anya Chalotra (Yennifer) and Freya Allan (Ciri).

        <updated>2024-05-22T14:55:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crytek has announced the release date for Hunt: Showdown’s new-gen update, which will also conclude support for the current console versions. This update was first announced last September and will essentially force last-gen players to migrate to current consoles to continue playing the popular shooter. 
In a developer update, general manager David Fifield announced that the CryEngine 5.11 Update will go live on August 15. This update is treated as a “significant relaunch” that brings native PS5/Xbox Series X/S support along with a host of technical improvements. However, it also means the PS4 and Xbox One versions will become unplayable.
That means these players must upgrade to current hardware to continue playing their copies of the game. Crytek assures these players that if they decide to upgrade, player accounts, entitlements, and all owned DLC will transfer to the new-gen version for no extra cost. 


In addition to technical improvements, the 5.11 Update also introduces a new map and biome. In the months leading to 5.11’s launch, Crytek plans to address community and survey feedback. That includes improved reporting systems to address cheating and toxic player behavior, design reworks tackling hunter revival, health chunks, restorations, burning down hunters, and reducing stalemates. The game is also getting a new user interface, and Crytek will continue evolving the game's recruitment and prestige progression requirements. 
Hunt: Showdown first launched for Xbox and PC in 2019, with the PS4 version arriving in 2020. The PvPvE first-person shooter is set in 1865 Louisiana as players, either alone or with two or three friends, hunt supernatural bounties in the bayou while fending off other player-controlled bounty hunters.

Former vidbud Liam and I used it, initially, as something we could do while catching up on life. But now? Now we're all in. Liam has created a spreadsheet of things we're ticking off to prepare for the upcoming expansion, and I think it's the perfect summation of what the game is to us: something that makes no sense at all and yet something that makes our brains hum with happiness.
And what we've found with Destiny, in all of its bloat, is that we haven't explored for a single second since our return. Everything is accomplished through menus, making it quite Starfield-esque, which is terrible… but also good. We can't make sense of it and we don't think we ever will.

A beam of light shoots out of a mysterious planet and a zoom in reveals the beam to be an asteroid, but not just any asteroid: a crystal shaped like a teardrop, with a little ghost nestled inside. You awaken as this little ghost, who it turns out, has crash landed in Eternity (and who, it turns out, is called Hauntii). Soon you bump into a ghostly girl, who guides you to a tower that thrusts you both up to a higher plane - but though she ascends, you're dragged back to the bottom at the last moment by some netherworldly chains. And so, as Hauntii you travel through Eternity to discover who that girl was and, ultimately, how to ascend to those heavenly skies yourself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We just got a new Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree story trailer yesterday. As is their druthers, FromSoft have at once made the events it depicts feel of earth-shattering importance while providing basically no concrete information. A lot of people will be putting out gargantuan theory posts right now, rambling on about Miquella, the Crucible, the Golden Order blah blah. This is all a distraction. Anyone with eyes can tell you that the primary movers and shakers of this final chapter in the Lands Between are a secret faction of hitherto secret spear people. You're likely confused, and that's understandable. As the foremost authority on ephemeral nonsense in Elden Ring, I’m the only one who has your back here.

The pre-rendered trailer features no gameplay (as near as I can tell) and tells the story of Miquella and the war that sent them to the Land of Shadow. The footage hints at a location around the Lands Between that you and others will presumably visit.


Elden Ring's Shadow of the Erdtree DLC will be released on June 21 and will not be a standalone expansion. It requires ownership of the original game and will cost $39.99. A physical collector's Edition of the DLC package will also be available for $249.99 and will include a statue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enix has announced that several Kingdom Hearts games are coming to Steam next month. Three compilations, and a compilation of those compilations, will bring the entire “Dark Seeker Saga” to Valve’s storefront.
On June 13, you can purchase the following titles on Steam:
Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 + 2.5 ReMIX
Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue
Kingdom Hearts III + Re Mind DLC
Kingdom Hearts Integrum Masterpiece (bundle that includes all the above compilations)
If you’re jumping into the series for the first time or returning from a long absence and have no idea how to decipher the bizarre names of these titles, here’s what each game includes:
Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 +2.5 ReMIX
Kingdom Hearts Final Mix
Kingdom Hearts Re:Chain of Memories
Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days (HD remastered cinematics)
Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix
Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep Final Mix
Kingdom Hearts: Re:Coded (HD remastered cinematics)
Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue
Kingdom Hearts Dream Drop Distance HD
Kingdom Hearts 0.2 Birth by Sleep -A Fragmentary Passage-
Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover (movie)
Kingdom Hearts III + Re Mind
Kingdom Hearts III
Re Mind DLC
This isn’t the first time the Kingdom Hearts series has come to PC. These games have been available on the Epic Game Store since 2021. But it’s always nice to see another audience experience a beloved franchise. Now everyone can get up to speed and join the wait for more news on the upcoming Kingdom Hearts IV.
The franchise’s move to Steam also comes shortly after Square Enix announced it would “aggressively” pursue a multi-platform strategy after Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and Final Fantasy XVI fell short of sales expectations. The publisher is in the midst of a structural reform that led to a swath of layoffs across its California and UK offices last week.]]></summary>

The Mario brand of RPG represents some of my favorite adventures in the genre. The comedic tone, inviting art, and active battle systems have always been highlights for me, but Thousand-Year Door was a personal blind spot. I played prior and subsequent Mario RPGs, but I skipped it when the original was released in 2004, and notably was not yet employed at Game Informer at the time. With Nintendo remastering the acclaimed RPG for Switch, I welcomed the excuse to finally play it. I am impressed by how improved the…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I could pretend I understand Square Enix's action-RPG series Kingdom Hearts, but I don't need to, 'cos what I do understand is how popular it is. Until fairly recently the nearly 15-game-strong series, where Disney characters cross over with Final Fantasy and go to war alongside a child wielding a key (I said I don't properly understand it), wasn't on PC. After some games arrived on the Epic Games Store in 2021, Squeenix have confirmed that multiple Kingdom Hearts games are coming to Steam next month, on June 13th. Unlucky for some, maybe, but not Donald Duck and Goofy, two of the main characters. Long has Goofy been seen as just a joke character in the minds of people people who didn't watch A Goofy Movie. Hopefully this brings his heroism to a wider audience.

That's why the latest free update excites me so, as it introduces an artifact that makes chests malicious and another that lets you hatch angry lizard companions. Oh, and there's a new map, too.

But in this ultimate game of keeping-up-with-the-Jones, the life sim from Paradox has slipped on a wet kitchen tile. The game has been delayed for a third time, and the developers are reluctant to set a new date for the planned release into early access. "[We] believe it is more prudent to hold off while we plan ahead," said Mattias Lilja of Paradox Interactive, "rather than committing to a new date that we cannot be certain to meet."

Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice didn’t need a sequel. It had a clear story to tell, and it told it well with an artful (and tactful) execution of its mental health themes and a strong conclusion. But Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II builds a great case for itself by using the titular warrior’s growth to help not only herself but, for the first time, others around her, shining her in a fascinating new light.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wacky space station management sim Startopia and wacky hosptial sim Theme Hospital are two of my favourite older games, so I was very pleased with the concept of Galacticare, which is a wacky space station hospital management sim. And you know what? It's great! From early reveals and previews I thought it might veer into being too wacky, but it nails its tone, has some really striking levels, and bugs in earlier builds have been squashed (much as you can manually splat small parasites that make their way into your hospital). I can see this becoming a go-to comfort game for me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I may have winced a bit, initially, at Alice Bee’s choice of RPS Game Club game for this month. Deathbulge: Battle of the Bands looked funny and all, but it’s a turn-based RPG, a subgenre that usually elicits the same amount of enthusiasm from me as the phrase "by Ernest Cline" does from Alice. Deathbulge, however, is a clever little sod of a game, managing to devise not only a turn-based combat system that avoids the usual waiting-around tedium but one that’s outright good fun in itself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The remake of the 1994 first-person immersive sim shooter was completely remade by developer Night Studios recently and it is finally making its way to consoles. It's the game that laid the groundwork for experiences like Bioshock, 2017's Prey, and many more in the genre, and the remake is both faithful and impressively contemporary. Join Wesley LeBlanc, Marcus Stewart, and me for a look at the game's opening moments on Xbox Series X and a discussion about the state of the genre that System Shock arguably invented.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are management games and there are micro-management games. Prison Architect 2 is the latter. I don't mean this as an annoying thing, like when Harold from corporate starts commenting all over your document at 4.30pm on a Friday. I mean it as a distinction between those games that let you plop down a house, and others that need you to stack the bricks, install the plumbing, fit the lights, and select the wallpaper. The first Prison Architect allowed you to finesse every detail of a secure correctional facility, down to each cell and dog kennel. Unsurprisingly for a sim about prison, it encouraged obsessive control. The 3D-ified sequel isn't finished yet, but it's taking a similar approach. Maybe a little too similar.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Player First Games and publisher Warner Bros. Games have released the launch trailer for its upcoming platform fighter, MultiVersus, seemingly revealing Friday the 13th's Jason Voorhees and The Matrix's Agent Smith as new roster additions. This trailer arrives just a few weeks after we learned MultiVersus finally (re)launches next week. 
After roughly two minutes of MultiVersus hijinks with various characters from the game, the Joker, which we recently learned is joining the game with a voice by Mark Hamill, is seen sitting on the Iron Throne of Game of Thrones fame. Then, mysteriously, Jason and Agent Smith appear beside him, likely alluding to them joining the launch day roster. 
Check it out for yourself in the MultiVersus launch trailer below: 


MultiVersus is a free-to-play game and will launch on May 28 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. 
For more, read Game Informer's MultiVersus review after its first launch back in 2022, and then check out Joker's MultiVersus gameplay and his Batman Who Laughs alternate costume.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Larian Studios, the team behind last year's Baldur's Gate 3, has opened a new studio in Warsaw, Poland. Larian Studios Warsaw is the developer-publisher's seventh studio worldwide, and joins others in Barcelona, Dublin, Gent, Guildford, Kuala Lumpur, and Quebec. 
"With two very ambitious RPGs now starting development, what better way to see our visions realized than by growing our team and opening a 7th studio in the heart of Poland's lively gaming scene," the company's announcement post on X (formerly) Twitter reads. 


As for what those two RPGs are, don't expect a sequel to Baldur's Gate 3. Despite winning countless awards last year, including Game of the Year at The Game Awards 2023, Larian's CEO revealed back in March that the studio is done with both Baldur's Gate 3 – so no expansions – and the Baldur's Gate series in general. 
Over on a separate blog post about Larian Studios Warsaw, the company talks about its plans with seven worldwide studios open now. 
"Larian Studios set up base in one of the greatest RPG development hubs in the world – Poland, where we opened our doors in the historic city of Warsaw," the blog post reads. "Like its sister studios across the globe, Larian Studios Warsaw is dedicated to fostering an environment where developers can thrive creatively and reclaim their agency. Systems-heavy RPGs need best-in-class developers; that's why we've put the people who build those systems at the center of our culture." 
For more, read Game Informer's Baldur's Gate 3 review, and then find out why it's on Game Informer's list of the top 10 RPGs to play right now.

To imagine there'll be any time for games! Pah!
I kid. Plenty of time for games for us all, even while reclining on gloriously beds with ungodly amounts of storage space. We love playing games here at Rock Paper Shotgun. Even Alice, who has routinely told me that actually there are no good games. Here's what we'll be clicking on this weekend.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Five Nights At Freddy’s 2, the sequel to the 2023 film adaptation of the popular horror game, has a premiere date. Freddy Fazbear and friends will return to the big screen on December 5, 2025.
As reported by Variety, Blumhouse Productions announced the date alongside a slate of other upcoming films, including M3GAN 2.0 and The Black Phone 2. It's not surprising to see Five Nights At Freddy’s getting a follow-up. It simultaneously premiered in theaters and on Peacock on October 27, 2023, and still managed to be a massive box office success. Grossing $297 million globally, it became the year's highest-grossing horror film, Blumhouse’s highest-grossing film ever, and the most-watched movie on Peacock for five straight days. 
The tagline for Five Nights At Freddy's 2 reads, "Anyone can survive five nights. This time, there will be no second chances." The sequel’s cast has not been announced, but the original starred Josh Hutchinson and included Matthew Lillard, Elizabeth Lail, Mary Stuart Masterson, and Piper Rubio. Director Emma Tammi is returning to direct the sequel, with FNAF creator Scott Cawthorn and Blumhouse founder Jason Blum once again assuming producer roles. 
FNAF 2 won't be the only video game film arriving in 2025. Mortal Kombat 2, the sequel to the 2021 reboot film, was recently confirmed to release in October of that year.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.

But it seems like the fallout from this recent boom in popularity hasn't died down quite yet. Thanks to a teaser shared on Fortnite's official social media pages, we know that Fallout will be coming to Fortnite pretty soon
pic.twitter.com/AKjFXVnHST
May 17, 2024
The teaser image shows power armor in a cloud of orange dust, accompanied by what appears to be some sort of industrial building. Other than that, there's not much to go on, but we can make educated guesses. For one, Fortnite's current season will end on May 24, so this is the perfect time to tease the skins that might be coming in the next battle pass. And if it's anything like the recent Avatar: The Last Airbender and Star Wars crossovers, we might see Fallout-themed mechanics or areas appear on the battle royale map itself.
It will almost certainly involve some sort of cosmetic pack as well, which could include characters from the games, the Amazon Prime show, or both. Thanks to the teaser, we know power armor will be making an appearance, but it's unclear whether it will be an item to equip in-game or a skin that can be unlocked or purchased.
For more Fortnite news, read about its recent crossover with Billie Eilish, its decision to allow players to block certain emotes, and its huge and mysterious collaboration with Disney.

It quietly does several things in a modest little way, that are all the more impressive for its lack of fanfare. The core one though, is that it takes the kind of simulationist foundation normally reserved for the punishing Dwarf Fortress derivatives or gnarly logistics games, and builds on them an approachable, gentle, even philosophical game instead. In a word: it's lovely.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday, EA Sports College Football 25’s cover athletes and release date were revealed. Today, the game’s first full trailer provides the look at it in action. 
The trailer shows that EA is seemingly going all out to replicate the pomp and passion of college football, with over-the-top team entrances, marching band performances, and mascots galore. It remains to be seen how fun or different the on-field action is compared to its Madden counterpart, but the game at least seems to capture the school spirit. 


EA also released a batch of new screenshots, which you can view in this gallery.

The same requirement, you might recall, that Helldivers 2 players recently lobbied Sony into abandoning. No such luck here, and as previously warned, the need for said PSN sign-in to happen over Windows means that Ghost of Tsushima is essentially missing a chunk of itself on the Steam Deck.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“In one of Nero’s many manifests,” reads a books in surreal puzzle-box Lorelei And The Laser Eyes, referring to its eccentric (read: tastefully deranged) antag-artist, “there is a satirical proposal claiming that only dictators should be allowed to direct films.” Developers Simogo - of well-deserved Sayonara Wild Hearts and Device 6 acclaim - seem to agree that’s a position worth satirising. Lorelei, despite its single-solution puzzles, is not dictatorial. It’s far too interested in collaborating with you for that. It wants you to observe, consider, and interpret its many mysteries. What’s really hooked me here is how those puzzles are kept coherent and logical, despite you getting delivered a letter by dog and occasionally visiting a floppy disk bizzaro world where you converse with a magician who manifests from his own discarded hat.

But while many have been surprised by the sheer volume of content available so far, it's still in Early Access, so the team at Supergiant will be updating and patching it for the foreseeable future. The first of those patches came today, and it adds a few small quality-of-life improvements.
Our first Early Access patch for Hades II is out now on Steam and the Epic Games Store!! We're very grateful for all the feedback so far, which inspired this first set of targeted improvements and fixes.

        <updated>2024-05-17T14:10:19.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft is reportedly planning to launch this year's Call of Duty on its Xbox Game Pass subscription service, according to The Wall Stree Journal. This follows reports in previous weeks indicating Microsoft and Xbox were mulling over whether or not to launch the next iteration in the franchise on Game Pass, out of fear it might hurt sales. 
After acquiring Activision Blizzard for a colossal $69 billion last year, fans and analysts have speculated about how Microsoft will handle the Call of Duty franchise moving forward. It will obviously be a big draw for Xbox Game Pass, pulling in new subscribers, but most every year, the new Call of Duty is the best-selling game of the year – save for last year, where Hogwarts Legacy took that crown – and a Game Pass launch could affect those sales numbers. 


However, this new report from The Wall Street Journal seemingly clears the air around that topic. 
"Microsoft plans a major shake up of its video game sales strategy by releasing the coming installment of Call of Duty to its subscription service instead of the longtime, lucrative approach of only selling it a la carte," the story reads. 
Of course, things could change so we'll see what happens. It's likely we'll be learning what the next Call of Duty game is next month as part of the gaming showcase summer that includes Summer Game Fest, Ubisoft Forward, and an Xbox Games Showcase followed by a secret direct that is probably focused on Call of Duty.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2K will reveal the next iteration of one of its biggest franchises at Summer Game Fest. Fans online are already speculating what it could be, considering some of 2K's biggest franchises are prime for a new game. 
As for when to expect this new game, the official SGF X (formerly Twitter) account says it will be announced on June 7, during the Summer Game Fest livestream that begins at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET. That's less than a month away so we don't have to speculate too long on what this mystery iteration could be.

May 16, 2024
While there are plenty of 2K franchises that fit the bill, our eyes are on three franchises: Borderlands, Mafia, and BioShock. 
The last mainline Borderlands entry – Borderlands 3 – hit PlayStation, Xbox, and PC in 2019, and with the live-action Borderlands movie hitting theaters this August, a new game would make sense. However, we did just get New Tales From The Borderlands in 2022, if you're looking for something to play through in that universe. 
On the Mafia front, the last mainline entry was Mafia III in 2016, although 2K released Mafia: Definitive Edition – a remake – in 2020. And we know the next Mafia game is in development, too, so it might be time for an announcement. 
BioShock has been dormant since BioShock Infinite in 2013, unless you count the 2016 remasters, and we know 2K created Cloud Chamber in 2019 to work on the next entry in the franchise. It's been almost five years since then, so SGF seems like a great moment to announce the next BioShock. Speaking of, here's what we want in a BioShock 4. 
SGF returns to Los Angeles next month, with the live showcase happening on June 7. For more, check out some of the studios, publishers, and partners to be featured during the event, and then check out Game Informer's summer gaming showcase schedule.

I imagine it'll involve a lot of fighting spindly monsters, dying, and resurrecting at whatever object they've decided will be the equivalent of Dark Souls' bonfires.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've clocked up nearly 400 hours playing BioWare's big fantasy RPG Dragon Age: Inquisition, which is not a stat I'm particularly proud of. I'm not ashamed either, partly because, as has been identified by artist Corey Brickley, via the Maw, there's a lot of filler. Brickley has collated a list of suggested mods to slim down Dragon Age: Inquisition from a potentially 80 hours-long epic to a trim 40 hour story-focused romp, which means you might be able to play through it again in time for the launch of Dragon Age: Dreadwolf - which is a direct sequel to Inquisition.
I find this list of mods interesting! It's a way to change the game quite substantially without exactly transforming it, and it's very in-keeping with my campaign to make games 60% smaller. Still, there's at least one item on there I'd push back on, but also this isn't really a new problem for Dragon Age as a series.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Grand Theft Auto VI's reveal last December sent fans into a tizzy, but its then-distant 2025 release window immediately tempered that excitement. While the launch seemed more in reach now that we’re nearly midway through 2024, it appears we’ll have to wait another full year before playing it.
Publisher Take-Two released its 2024 year-end financial report today (thanks, PC Gamer), in which it states that Rockstar is targeting a Fall 2025 release window for GTA VI. This timing is reiterated in a calendar of the publisher’s upcoming releases, posted below.
Regarding GTA VI, Take-Two states, “We are highly confident that Rockstar Games will deliver an unparalleled entertainment experience, and our expectations for the commercial impact of the title continue to increase.” The game is slated to release for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. A PC version has yet to be mentioned. 
Grand Theft Auto VI takes players to a modern-day Vice City (the franchise's parody of Miami, FL) and stars two protagonists, a female inmate named Lucia and her still-unnamed criminal male partner. To say anticipation is high would be an understatement; the premiere trailer garnered over 100 million views in only 24 hours, breaking a YouTube record. 
As we continue the long wait for Grand Theft Auto VI’s launch, check out our video of Game Informer’s two resident Florida Men reacting to the debut trailer. You can also read about Take-Two's recent closure of developers Roll7 (Rollerdrome, OlliOlli World) and Intercept Games (Kerbal Space Program 2).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ghost of Tsushima, specifically the Director's Cut, is out on PC today. It's a fantastic game that should be welcomed with open arms as it makes its way to a new platform, but we were specifically curious about how it performs on Steam Deck. The game is not Steam Deck verified primarily because certain features are not supported on Valve's handheld, or other comparable mobile PC game platforms. However, the offline content (the single-player campaign and the expansion) has been specifically adjusted to play well on Steam Deck. You can read port studio Nixxes Software explanation here. And spending a little time with the game shows that the single-player campaign does, in fact, play well on Steam Deck. It's not without its shortcomings – a high-end PC or a PlayStation 5 are still the best ways to play the game – but Steam Deck appears to be a great way to play the game if that's your only option or you want a portable version.
You can check out some gameplay with commentary from myself and Wesley LeBlanc below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Phoenix Labs, the developer behind last year's Fae Farm and Dauntless, has laid off staff and canceled in-development games as part of a restructuring at the studio. Polygon's Nicole Carpenter is reporting on X (formerly Twitter) that more than 100 people at Phoenix Labs were laid off. 
Shortly after Carpenter reported that, Phoenix Labs released the following statement: 


Phoenix Labs released its latest game, Fae Farm, back in September, and Dauntless before that in 2019. 
These layoffs join a string of other disheartening 2024 layoffs and closures, which now total more than 10,000 in just the first five months of the year. 
Square Enix announced earlier this week it will begin layoffs as part of "structural reforms," starting this week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA Sports College Football finally has a release date, cover stars, and two different editions. The long-awaited return to college football hits PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on July 19.
Gracing the cover of the game’s Standard edition are Michigan Wolverines running back Donovan Edwards, Texas Longhorns quarterback Quinn Ewers, and Colorado Buffaloes wide receiver/defensive back Travis Hunter. Check out the Standard and Deluxe covers in the gallery below.

The cover reveal comes a day before the game's full debut tomorrow. So far, we know that College Football 25 features 134 FBS schools, and it's being developed by Madden developer EA Orlando. The game was first announced in 2021 following a years-long hiatus for college football games due to the 2014 player likeness compensation lawsuit.
Both editions are now available for pre-order. The Standard Edition costs $69.99 and consists of the base game, Alma Mater and Cover Athlete Ultimate Team packs, and Bring Glory Home Ultimate Team Uniform Item. 
The $99.99 Deluxe Edition includes three days of early access (July 16-18), 4600 College Football Points, Heisman Hopeful/Alma Mater/Cover Athlete Ultimate Teams packs, and the Bring Glory Home Ultimate Team Uniform Item.
Lastly, a $149.99 MVP Bundle includes the Deluxe editions of EA Sports College Football 25 and the upcoming Madden NFL 25.]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-05-16T16:13:26.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Activision, the developer-publisher Microsoft and Xbox purchased for $69 billion last year, has formed a new studio called Elsewhere Entertainment, and it is developing a new "narrative-based and genre-defining AAA franchise." The studio is based in Warsaw, Poland, and, according to a report from IGN, it is not working on a Call of Duty-related project. 
This studio, which has been formed behind-the-scenes before today's public unveiling, arrives roughly one week after Xbox closed four Bethesda studios, including Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks and Redfall team Arkane Austin. While the company has yet to publicly address the closures directly, Xbox president Sarah Bond said in an interview that the closures were about keeping the business healthy in the long-term. It's why news of this new studio might be surprising, given one week ago, the parent company of Activision was closing studios to cut costs. 


"Built from the ground up, Elsewhere Entertainment is a premier and standalone studio dedicated to establishing an environment that inspires bold and diverse ideas," a blog post reads. "The team's underlying mission encourages everyone to explore and collaborate creatively to craft a franchise with an enduring legacy that resonates far beyond games. [The] new studio has full access to Activision's resources and tools as it continues to increase production and development. 
"Elsewhere is opening its search for best-in-class talent from across the industry and around the world to help create a state-of-the-art and next generation gaming experience." 
Elsewhere is currently made up of developers with experience working on franchises like The Last of Us, Uncharted, The Witcher, Cyberpunk 2077, Destiny, Tom Clancy's The Division, and Far Cry.

        <updated>2024-05-16T15:31:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Manor Lords, the medieval strategy city-builder and one of 2024's surprise hits, has surpassed two million copies sold. The game has only been available in PC Early Access since April 26, meaning it achieved this milestone in only three weeks.
Publisher Hooded Horse announced the sales account for Steam, Epic, GOG, and the Microsoft Store (where Manor Lords is also playable through PC Game Pass). The game quickly caught fire, selling 1 million copies a day after launch. Since then, Manor Lords has enjoyed a consistently high concurrent player count, peaking at 173,000 on Steam in its first weekend.  


Manor Lords is being developed by Slavic Games and puts players in the shoes of a medieval lord tasked with building and growing a city. Players manage their city’s community, infrastructure, economy, and defense/expansion, the latter of which unfold as large-scale tactical battles. The intricate social and production systems combined with an ever-changing world (complete with seasonal and weather changes) result in an organic metropolis that players have taken to in a big way. 
Manor Lords joins Early Access hits this year, such as Palworld and Hades II. The game’s 1.0 launch is currently up in the air as the game continues to change and improve based on player feedback. It’s off to a great start, though, and we’re curious to see how it evolves throughout its EA period.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You will need an internet connection to install Assassin's Creed Shadows, but after that, the entire experience can be played offline, Ubisoft has announced. The company did so after word online spread that Shadows requires a mandatory online connection to play the game. 
Following the reveal of Shadows yesterday, which showcased the dual samurai and shinobi protagonists we'll be controlling in 16th-century feudal Japan, people noticed wording in preorder listings and elsewhere that seemingly pointed to the game requiring an always-online connection. This frustrated fans of the series, especially given Shadows, like its recent predecessors, is a single-player game. However, that's not the case and Ubisoft released a statement today to clear the air. 


"Hey everyone, we wanted to share some of the early information on the upcoming launch of Assassin's Creed Shadows, following some questions we've noticed in the community," the statement reads. "Assassin's Creed Shadows will not require a mandatory connection at all times. An online connection will be needed to install the game, but you will be able to play the entire journey offline, and explore Japan without any online connection. 

"We are super excited to bring Assassin's Creed to Feudal Japan on November 15 when the game releases, and we cannot wait to show you more along the way." 

As you can see, it's clear Shadows is a game you can play offline, but only after connecting to the internet once to actually install the RPG. 
Assassin's Creed Shadows hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Amazon Luna, PC (via the Ubisoft Store and Epic Games Store), and Mac (with Apple silicon via the Mac App Store) on November 15.
For more, check out what we learned yesterday during the Shadows reveal, and then read Game Informer's ranking of the entire Assassin's Creed series.

Via Gematsu and PCGamer, Saito said, “I’ve been talking about wanting to do something with Yoko and Okabe for some time now. I’ll have something a bit more put-together to say in the not-too-distant future, so please stay tuned. It might be NieR, it might not be NieR. (Laughs.) That’s about all I can say for now.” Thanks for the clarity, Saito.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’re just a couple of days away from Ghost of Tsushima’s PC release date, as the former PlayStation exclusive prepares to drop its Director's Cut - including its expansion and multiplayer DLC - on Steam. Having recently cleared up the question around whether you’ll need to sign in with a PSN account after the Helldivers 2 debacle - yes, if you want to play the co-op mode - developers Nixxes and Sucker Punch have now revealed that the login requirement will mean multiplayer won’t work on Steam Deck.

        <updated>2024-05-15T17:14:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft has canceled The Division Heartland. First announced in 2021, the game was a free-to-play spin-off of The Division franchise developed by Red Storm Studio.
Ubisoft revealed the cancelation in an earnings report, stating,
“As part of Ubisoft’s efforts to streamline its operations and adapt to evolving market trends, there have been further reorganizations within the Global Publishing teams, both at the APAC region, that is not organized into three engagement hubs, and at the central level. Additionally, in line with the increased selectivity of its investments, Ubisoft has decided to stop development on The Division Heartland and has redeployed resources to bigger opportunities such as XDefiant and Rainbow Six.”


The Division Heartland had been quiet for some time after its reveal, including being delayed. It eventually resurfaced with closed beta tests, but scarce updates on its existence caused doubt and confusion among fans. The game was billed as a PvEvP survival action experience with players controlling a Division agent tasked with protecting a small town from enemy factions and chemical contamination. 
Despite the cancellation, we know it doesn't mean the end of the franchise. Ubisoft announced The Division 3 last September, with series creator Massive Entertainment back at the helm. That game currently has no release window. 
Heartland joins an expanding graveyard of canceled Ubisoft projects over the past few years. In January 2023, the publisher canceled its upcoming team-based arena battler Project Q and three other games in development. In 2022, the battle royale Ghost Recon Frontline, Splinter Cell VR, and two unannounced games were also axed. An unannounced sequel to Immortals Fenix Rising was also reportedly scrapped last July.]]></summary>

As many speculated, Shadows puts players in control of Japan's first African samurai, Yasuke (a real historical figure), and a female shinobi character, Naoe. It will be released on November 15.
This dual protagonist approach isn't too surprising given it's Ubisoft Quebec developing the game – it did the same with Kassandra and Alexios in 2018's Assassin's Creed Odyssey and Jacob and Evie Frye in 2015's Assassin's Creed Syndicate – but it's exciting nonetheless.

Anyway, my version of that is Starship Troopers. As in, I’ve been waiting for a videogamey excuse to bang on about it in public for ages. Helldivers 2 is obviously as good an excuse as any, but really, I needn’t have waited so long.

Last month, I had a chance to play Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble, the first all-new entry in the Super Monkey Ball (SMB) franchise in more than a decade. While I went into the demo skeptical that the series, which experienced its best years in the early-to-mid 2000s, could feel like a modern experience in 2024, I emerged from the demo impressed by the gameplay improvements, single-player level design, and the game's approach to multiplayer (you can read my full preview here).

"I really like cats, I just hate the internet UWU nonsense about cats," I said. "God it's awful, I can't stand it, Jesus Christ it's just an empty and terrible way to talk about cats, cats don't deserve to be the internet animal-" at which point Graham managed to interrupt and said I was exactly the person who should write about Little Kitty, Big City.
I promise, I approached Little Kitty, Big City with an open heart, because I do really like cats. But given my aversion to their babification by the internet, it may be surprising that my chief complaint about Little Kitty, Big City is that the hats in it are largely not cute enough. This is a bold claim, because there are more than 40 to collect.

As Season 2 shoots are underway, images from filming have begun to leak, but today's images are the first official shots from the upcoming season, which is due out next year. 
Pascal's Joel appears to be in the barn where a very important and intense scene between he and Ellie takes place, while Ellie appears to be inside a wintery location, likely somewhere in the game's beginning where snow is abundant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nic reckons Homeworld 3, the long-awaited spacefaring RTS, is mostly pretty good. Qualified hoorays for that, as well as for the fact that it doesn’t make especially mad demands of your hardware: besides netting a Steam Deck Playable badge from Valve, its minimum PC specs only list the likes of the Intel Core i5-6600 and Nvidia’s GTX 1060. Easily doable, for most aspiring galactic admirals.
Once a battle gets underway, however, Homeworld 3’s performance can start tanking, turning an initially smooth engagement into a more stutter-prone light show. The good news? You can more than double your framerates with a relatively small handful of graphics setting changes, even if some these (including the DLSS and FSR 2 upscalers) can be a tad inconsistent in their own right.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The characters in Read Only Memories: Neurodiver are deeply into anime. They love manga and figurines and trashy movies and horror novels. The interests of the game's creators have not so much leaked into this fictional world as they have been generously pumped in with an industrial hose. Even the visual novel's loading screens take the form of those two-second intermission panels that flash up to signal an anime's commercial break, complete with random characters announcing the game's name ("Neurodiver!"). In moments like that, the passion is endearing. But in other places, it is overwhelming. Neurodiver is obsessed with media in a way that often distracted me from the bright-eyed cyberpunk story it wants to tell.

As he stepped off court for the last time, I found myself welling up. He doesn't know me - of course he doesn't - and I don't know him. But for ten years I'd watch him at every opportunity and see him grow into one of the all-time greats. For me, his retirement wasn't only devastating in the sense he was a great ambassador for the sport: a positive soul, a good speaker, a hard worker. No, it also spelled the end of us being able to witness something impossible to replicate, a 'game' of badminton uniquely his. And for a magical two years, he had the best game in the world.

This update from the Hi-Fi Rush X account comes roughly one week after Xbox shut down the game's developer, Tango Gameworks, alongside Redfall studio Arkane Austin, and two more Bethesda teams. While there won't be any more Hi-Fi Rush content coming from Tango Gameworks, hopefully today's patch puts the game in the best playable state possible so that future players can enjoy the 2023 hit. 
Thank you all for your continued support.
May 15, 2024
The closure of Tango Gameworks arrived roughly a year after the team delivered the extremely well-received Hi-Fi Rush, which by Xbox's own admitted metrics, was a big success. A few days after the closure of these studios, Xbox president Sarah Bond addressed the situation, stating that it's about keeping the business healthy in the long-term.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Sims 4 is nothing if not a teetering jenga tower of updates and add-ons and DLC packs, and the latter half of 2024 will be no exception for EA's life sim king. Yesterday saw the release of an update to the base game's swimwear, kicking off the updates teased in the recently-revealed new roadmap, Season Of Love. The roadmap video's vibe is that it and its partner saw you from across the bar and wondered if you'd be interested in joining them, and it kind of weirds me out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think most would agree that the artist formerly known as Twitter has never been in more need of a thermonuclear cleansing. The Musk era has transformed what was already fondly known as a hellsite into something at once more obnoxious and sadder, whether you're talking about the web3 grifters or the resurgent debate-me cryptofascists or the recommendation algorithm's perceptibly greater enthusiasm for quote-tweet flamebait.
Still, there are lights in the darkness. Yesterday, Graham pointed us towards a thread started by The End Is Nigh developer Tyler Glaiel in which he challenged other developers to "take a short break, pick a number in your code or data files, multiply it by 1000, and post the results". Other developers have heeded the call. Here's a round-up of the results that doubles as a watery echo of Alice0's (RPS in peace) old Screenshot Saturday Monday features.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Old-school FPS adventure The Explorator contains much more intense shooty violence than the adorable lizardy folk that populate it might immediately suggest. I really want to use the word ‘zany’ without irony here to describe its hand-drawn 2D style and animations, but I’m afraid that ship has long since sailed into the sun. I’ll go with ‘caffeinated’ I think. Like the Adult Swim cartoons it reminded me of, it’s got a sense of the sardonic and a penchant for violence, but still comes from a place of having recently devoured several bowls of suspiciously colorful cereal. Anyways, forget all that. I mentioned an FPS in the title, so I must assume you’re here for the violence.

Well, now you can have another 15 years. Braid Anniversary Edition is out on Steam now, a high definition remastering of a classic indie. It got stuck in time following a few delays but it's finally defrosted now. The sharper look will appeal to pixel perfectionists, but there are also 40 new levels for serial rewinders.

If so, you'll probably love the smell of Valheim's Ashlands biome, which has just launched for all players after a period of beta testing. Sadly, my computer is incapable of producing smells beyond a faint reek of encrusted pasta sauce and regret, but if it did, I imagine I'd even now be basking in the aroma of burning bone and feather, because that is what the 10 new creatures you'll meet in the Ashlands consist of, broadly. Shout-out in particular for the monster that resembles a combusting sink clog with spider legs. Very Possum-esque.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Casting of Frank Stone, the upcoming narrative horror game set in the Dead By Daylight universe by Until Dawn developer Supermassive Games, has its first gameplay trailer. The game was first announced at the 2023 Game Awards. 
The story unfolds in 1980 in the town of Cedar Hills, a town scarred by the murderous killer Frank Stone. It stars four friends who set out to create a horror film at a derelict steel mill dubbed Murder Mill. Naturally, that goes as horribly as you’d imagine, and players must survive by making choices that decide the characters’ relationships and fates. Sudden quick-time events can also be the deciding factor between whether someone lives or dies. 


Similar to Supermassive’s previous titles like The Quarry and the Dark Pictures Anthology, The Casting of Frank Stone can go down multiple paths based on your choices. Players will also solve environmental puzzles and gather clues to learn more about Cedar Hills
The Casting of Frank Stone still has no release date, but it will launch later this year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

Nagai Industries founder Dima Shen has been obsessed with that unassuming Tomato Convenience Store since he was a teenager, partly for the contrast it offers to the rest of the game. "Shenmue was a really depressing game, I would say - your father is killed, it's always raining," he tells me. "But there's one kind of super-healthy place in the whole game: a convenience store!"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My evolving relationship with Vampire Therapist continues apace - much how protagonist Sam's acumen as an unlicensed therapist for the unsettled undead develops at speed. He's a vampire doing therapy for other vampires, while also undergoing therapy, as a vampire, from another therapist (who is a vampire). Vampire Therapist! I've been able to get to grips with a playable preview - I'd say I got my teeth into it, but I'm not that much of a hack fraud - which means I got to see some of the things that creative director Cyrus Nemati told me about in our interview in action. I remain optimistic that, on it's release on June 18th, Vampire Therapist can walk the tricky line it's drawn for itself.  

It's balancing on a knife point of humour, the supernatural, and sincerity about mental health, the latter using real cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT; the comments the first time I wrote about Vampire Therapist revealed a lot about our readership) concepts in consultation with licensed therapists. The preview only covered Sam's first meeting with his mentor, Andromachos, and the first client Sam treats himself - a doctor called Drayne, simultaneously self-loathing and self-aggrandising - but it gave a flavour of how the game plays. Rather than a sort of janky template on how to self-therapise, as I'd feared, when you're playing Vampire Therapist it operates more as a sort of language puzzle against different types of theatre kids.

Far from being a nuisance, meta-jank like this only endears me further to Dread Delusion. It is an RPG from the other side of some attic mirror, an Elder Scrolls from a parallel 2002. It has, somehow, slipped into our reality and is seeing its full release today. There are gods you can thank for this, but we dare not speak their names.

The top contenders are currently trying to crack a difficult spot to reach the 12th floor, at which point the course will reveal unknown territory. They seem a little tired, which is not surprising. They are 11 days into the event.
