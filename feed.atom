        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At this point, it's safe to say that people are ready for The Elder Scrolls 6. While we're likely still years away from playing it, it feels as though Bethesda will start putting more stock into the Skyrim follow-up now that Starfield is out.


With that in-mind, a recent interview with MinnMax suggests that some elements from previous TES games will make their way into the sixth installment. Former Bethesda employee Bruce Nesmith – who was lead designer for Skyrim – has said that elements that go as far back as Oblivion could be "further developed" for The Elder Scrolls 6.


That particular part of the interview begins around the one-hour 13-minute mark.




However, Nesmith is not certain what these aspects will be. He does add that we will find his "fingerprints" in the next installment based on how the games have been designed in the past and his impact on the series.


It's a kind of magic


Nesmith then goes on to say that TES6 will likely have traces of the magical elements from Skyrim. So if you like the magic system in TES5, that's something to perhaps look forward to (maybe).


Bruce had been involved with the Elder Scrolls franchise since 1996's Daggerfall, eventually becoming Senior Game Designer for Bethesda. He was also a quest designer for Fallout 3. If you've played a Bethesda RPG since the mid-90s, you'll have experienced Nesmith's input. These days, he's a fantasy novelist. His first novel, Mischief Maker: Norse Mythology Reimagined, was released in 2021.


As for The Elder Scrolls 6, we're still pretty much in the dark. Nesmith's comments seem largely speculative, so it's best not to take what he says as the final word in what the elusive Skyrim follow-up will be like.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this month, Sony revealed new slim models of its PlayStation 5 hardware. Both the disc drive and digital model are getting upgrades, but alongside this news, the company also revealed a new detachable disc drive. This optional drive can be added to a new slim model of the digital PS5, turning it into a console that can use discs. It seems this drive will require an internet connection to use, however. 
Some images of a potentially upcoming Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III slim PS5 bundle have leaked online (thanks, CharlierIntel) and in the small text on the box, it says, "Internet connection required to pair Disc Drive and PS5 console upon startup."
Hey, @PlayStation & @cerny, we need to talk!
https://t.co/GacpULuDu0 pic.twitter.com/IIF1iB2zgV
October 25, 2023
Understandably, many players and video game preservationists aren't enthused about the online requirement as there could come a day when the servers the console and disc drive attach to are offline, making the optional accessory useless. Given the text on the box, it sounds like the internet connection is a one-time thing, only needed to pair the disc drive with the console, but it's unclear if it's required after that. 
Game Informer has reached out to PlayStation to ask about the internet connection requirement and if a connection is required beyond initial setup; we will update this story if we learn more. 
The same leaked images that you can see above also point to an unannounced Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III slim PS5 bundle that comes with the console, a DualSense controller, and the game.
For more, catch up on all the biggest Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III news from a recent COD Next livestream, and then read about how Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III won't come to Xbox Game Pass this year, even after Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard earlier this month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New trailer fresh out of the oven.
We have loved the look of Paper Mario-inspired RPG Born of Bread ever since we first laid eyes on it. We loved it still when we recently went hands-on with the game's first three hours, and that love will be continuing before the year is out as developer WildArts Studio and publisher Dear Villagers have shared that the title will be coming to Switch on 5th December.
This new release date follows a previous delay in which the devs announced that the game needed a little more time to prove. Fortunately, it seems like the extra time has helped things along the way, with the new release date trailer (above) showing the upcoming RPG in all of its button-timed, 2.5D-visualised glory.

If you are considering picking up the physical edition of Konami's Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1, you might want to bear in mind just how little is packed onto the cart without completing some rather meaty updates.
We have known that the Master Collection Vol. 1 on Switch would require a good number of downloads for some time now (Konami's website is quite open about this fact), but what we hadn't realised was just how little is included in the cartridge's 2 GB of front-loaded content.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“Not everyone is Nintendo,” Hilmar Veigar Pétursson says. “Corporate entities, historically, are not very long-living. By being 30 years old, CCP is old by company standards.” As we talk, his fixation on persistence and artefact becomes clear. Though, he’s never hidden it. In 2014, Pétursson’s company, CCP, unveiled a five-metre-tall sculpture with the names of every active player in their MMO, EVE Online, etched into its surface; this year, they expanded the monument to add the names of players who have subscribed in the decade since. “I've been obsessed about doing things like printed books, magazines, models of EVE Online...,” Pétursson tells me, “like there's this need to leave a footprint.” 



Pétursson has discovered a company that uses cow stem cells to 3D print calfskin. For the studio’s 30th anniversary, he plans to commission a poetry chapter inspired by Iceland’s epic history book, the Prose Edda, write it on the artificial skin, and put it in a Reykjavik museum. It would sit alongside an ancient calfskin copy of the Icelandic sagas. “It was written 1000 years ago, but as an Icelandic person, I can still read and understand what it says,” Pétursson explains. He tells me that it’s an effective way of storing data because if you sent a USB stick 1,000 years into the future, where would you even find a computer with a drive to read it? This appreciation for artefacts and need for legacy has led to his current project, a new game from CCP using blockchain technology, currently known as Project Awakening.

That fight produced a crowdfunded 414-page design bible but came to an end earlier this year when rights-holders EA rejected the pitch, and McGee declared that he had "no other ideas or energy left to apply toward getting a new Alice game made."

McGee reiterated similar sentiments in a new video discussing the project's end, but he did suggest one "ray of hope" to the community. "The design bible as produced is the perfect thing to feed into an AI system to have it completely build the game that is outlined in that design bible."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dynamight Studios announced today that its open-world sandbox MMORPG Fractured Online will be returning to Steam Early Access. The official release date for the return is November 8 at 10 a.m. ET. It's been a rough road so far for the MMO. Originally Gamigo became the publisher for the game, but after a short period of time Dynamight pulled the MMO from steam and later parted ways with Gamigo. They are now self-publishing the MMO as it heads back into early access.




It seems to be the common thing now for MMORPG developers to part ways with their publisher and take on the role. A couple of years ago Pearl Abyss split ways with Kakao Games over publishing popular MMORPG Black Desert Online. Not-yet-released MMO Ashes of Creation also split ways with its publisher, My.Games, and will self-publish the MMO whenever it releases.


Regardless of the reason, it's good news for the players Gamigo has a history of killing MMOs, which they've done with Fiesta Online and most of Trion Worlds' lineup of MMOs including Archeage, Rift, and Trove.


As for Fractured Online, it looks like an entertaining twist on the sandbox MMO formula. Players will work together, and against one another, as they claim zones, gather resources, craft, trade, and build their own empire. The MMO features a player-driven economy as players can be farmers, hunters, scavengers, miners, crafters, and even merchants.


Apparently there were some wipes previously, but moving forward there will be no wipes unless it is "strictly necessary".


Fractured Online hits Early Access on Steam on November 8.

"We do think Awesomenauts and Swords & Soldiers are both strong games, and they were on Wade's radar. When we found out that they were available it made the decision to acquire them easier.


Both games show off Ronimo’s sense of humor, their ability to create compelling characters and stories, and their game design. They were received very positively when they were released, and they continue to support an active player base and community of fans. So, we think they are a good addition to Atari’s portfolio, and we will explore ways to continue to support and commercialize the existing games and the underlying IP.

The five-member girl group under HYBE consists of Kim Chaewon, Sakura, Huh Yunjin, Kazuha, and Hong Eunchae. The powerhouse girl group debuted in May 2022 with their title track ‘Fearless’. Since their debut, they’ve taken the K-pop industry by storm as well as the gaming scene.


Le Sserafim’s newest single, ‘Perfect Night,’ will be featured in Overwatch 2 via a fun and colorful music video. The video is set to air on Thursday, October 26, at 9 p.m. PDT.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Fall Guys and Final Fantasy XIV crossover is finally happening as part of the MMORPG's Patch 6.51, launching October 31. Players can participate in obstacle courses inspired by the free-to-play title within the Golden Saucer casino/theme park.


Initially announced in July, the crossover teased FFXIV characters crossing a bright obstacle course. Fall Guys, meanwhile was receiving skins from the critically acclaimed MMORPG. Outside the stills shown within the teaser, the details are light on the FFXIV side. That is still the case since the blog post announcing the patch tells fans to stay tuned for more details.


As of now, the crossover's webpage is also giving the same instructions, so hopefully, more details arrive soon. Based on the images shown, players will race others while avoiding various dangers and collaborate with others to collect gems. The Fall Guys influence is evident here, but the events have details from Final Fantasy titles.


The event tonally fits with what the Golden Saucer goes for, which is grand and extravagant fun for any attendees. In my experience playing Final Fantasy XIV, chucking players into an arena with dozens of others is something the casino would do. Plus Fall Guys is the perfect game to collaborate with on this event given that it's that title's premise.


It's unknown how long this event will go on, especially since the FFXIV skins in Fall Guys are no longer available. Hopefully, the courses live up to their potential enough for fans to sink more hours earning prizes in the casino.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Don't call it a comeback. Metroid has been having a fantastic past few years with the success of Metroid Dread and Metroid Prime Remastered, and the franchise is in a great spot. But it's never a bad time to release more Metroid merch, and First 4 Figures is doing just that with this Samus Varia Suit PVE statue.




The Metroid Prime Varia Suit First 4 Figures statue is up for pre-order


Available for pre-order via the figure's landing page, you'll find both collector's and exclusive editions in tow for $149.99. To clarify, the exclusive edition comes with more stuff and is available at a discount (normally $164.99) through November 27.


Here's what you get in general:



The 11" PVC painted statue


Two interchangeable arms


An LED light-up function (for the glowing portions of the suit)


A base based on the Screw Attack/Metroid logo


A leaflet and collector's box



Here's a quick breakdown of the exclusive edition:


"Only in the Exclusive Edition will you get a premium deluxe box, limited edition numbering, authentication card, rechargeable battery, and USB charging cable."


First 4 Figures is known for their detail, and they're boasting a "subtle view of Samus' face behind the visor" for this one, which is extra rad. If you want it, the first batch of pre-orders (approximately 1000 units) will be delivered in Q1 of 2024, with the second batch coming in Q2 of the same year. To pony up for it, you'll need to make a non-refundable deposit of 20% of the purchase price (roughly $30).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In August, Night Dive Studios announced it was remastering the classic ‘90s first-person shooter Star Wars: Dark Forces. We now know that this modernization of one of the most beloved Star Wars games is coming on February 28. 
Night Dive, a studio specializing in reviving classic games such as its remake of System Shock that launched in May, is shining up the 1995 Star Wars title with 4K resolution and a 120 fps bump (on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC). Textures and lighting have been enhanced, and controls have been modernized to support today’s gamepads. That includes platform-specific features such as gyro/motion controls, rumble, and a new weapon wheel. The cherry on top is that Dark Forces Remaster has achievements/trophies.


Dark Forces stars Kyle Katarn, a mercenary who defected from the Galactic Empire and joined the Rebel Alliance. He’s tasked with infiltrating the Empire and foiling its plans to create an army of powerful new stormtroopers and battle droids, better known as the Dark Trooper Project. It was the first Star Wars FPS game and is remembered as one of the better Doom-inspired games of the time. 
Star Wars: Dark Forces Remaster is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. You can watch some former GI editors play the original version in this classic episode of Replay, and learn about the making of Dark Forces in this retrospective feature.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dynasty Warriors 9 is getting another turn in the spotlight, this time in the form of a mobile game. Nexon and Koei Tecmo announced Dynasty Warriors M for a global release this winter. 


Dynasty Warriors M promises an action-RPG based on the ninth mainline entry, which left something to be desired when it launched in 2018. The mobile version for iOS and Android will be free-to-play with in-app purchases, offering over 50 Officers from five factions to "collect and develop." Each Officer has their own tactics to employ across 520 stages and 13 regions.


According to Gematsu, a soft launch is live in Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Philippines. While we wait for the worldwide launch, Nexon Korea shared some cinematic trailers. This one highlights the Battle of Hulao Gate:




The last we heard of Dynasty Warriors 9 was the Empires expansion that launched in 2021. M isn't the first game to strike phones and tablets exclusively. Dynasty Warriors: Overlords recently mixed Musou combat with town building, quests, and very mobile-style events. As teased in some of the videos, M will cover territory familiar to anyone modestly well-versed in the Three Kingdoms era. Settings like the Yellow Turban Rebellion and the Siege of Luoyang are deeply tread hack-and-slashing ground.


Will Dynasty Warriors M revitalize the greatest video game series ever? The official English Facebook page is live for anyone who wants to keep up with the game in the months leading up to its global release.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few weeks ago I wrote about Grand Theft Auto players describing the movement of planes in random GTA promotional art as evidence of a forthcoming GTA 6 reveal, timed to intersect with the waning gibbous moon. I thought that the furore might die down after GTA 6 failed to materialise in accordance with the lunar cycle, but it turns out this rabbit hole has no bottom.
Come now, gaze upon the above, just-posted Rockstar promotional image for a new Red Dead Online outfit. To my eye, that picture looks like a weird dude in a mask, gazing at you through piles of skulls. Standard Halloween gamer fare. But it turns out that when you draw lines on it using MS Paint, you end up with the below.

Update : After being teased earlier this month, First 4 Figures has now provided a proper look at the upcoming Metroid Prime 'Samus Varia Suit' statue (spoilers: it's a stunner) and opened pre-orders.
The Collector's Edition statue is estimated to be released in Q1 2024 and will retail at $179.99 on the First 4 Figures website. There is also a swanky Exclusive Edition of the model which includes a series of LED lights to really make the details pop — this one normally retails at $197.99 but is subject to a pre-order discount until 27th November which brings it down to $179.99.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the most unnerving things about Geometric Interactive's lush insect puzzler Cocoon is how intuitive it feels. For my money, anyway. The premise is perfectly brain-bending: each world contains or is contained by another world, and you're a beetle who can not only leap between them, but pick one world up and use it as a puzzle prop inside another.
The game doesn't really verbalise any of this: there's no equivalent for Atreus in God Of War: Ragnarok, ostentatiously nudging you towards each solution. And yet somehow, I find myself flowing through Cocoon like I'm being poured out of a bottle, switching scales and putting together the pieces in a way that feels effortful yet graceful, earned yet... eerily frictionless. This is no reflection on my knack for solving puzzles. It's a show of how elegantly the game is made so that while there's difficulty, there's rarely frustration.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Alan Wake 2's launch rapidly approaching, fans are more than ready to jump back into Bright Falls. Before you get too excited, you should check your PC specs to ensure your graphics card supports mesh shading. 


On Twitter, a Remedy developer stated that the Nvidia GeForce 10 series and AMD Ryzen 5000 graphics cards aren't mentioned in the PC spec requirements because "only cards with mesh shaders are officially supported" and they're "not sure it will run without it." Hence, just because an RX 5700 XT can perform in the same ballpark as some of the supported cards, this doesn't guarantee you'll be able to play the game. 


The tweets have since been deleted, though screenshots are still available on Reddit. Remedy was going to implement vertex shaders, which the cards support, but they dropped after it caused performance issues and bugs. The developer states that vertex shaders could, in theory, be added later via a mod, but it's not something you should hold your breath for. 




This news comes as fans are still reeling from the high PC spec requirements for the game. A new Nvidia trailer showcasing ray tracing in Alan Wake 2 makes it apparent why Remedy has made the choices it had. With ray tracing on, Bright Falls becomes a visual treat filled with reflective puddles, accurate shadows, and shiny surfaces that reflect light.  


It has been a 13-year-long wait but Alan Wake 2 will finally launch on October 27.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Puzzle game Suika, or 'That Watermelon Game', is currently having a bit of a moment online. It's been available on Switch for a couple of years now in Japan, but this week it received an English eShop version, and it's taken off a bit with streamers and Twitch folk. It's also spawned dozens of clones, including an unofficial free web browser version that I've been giving a go over the last couple of lunch times to see what all the fuss is about. It's a neat little time waster. It's a teensy bit different to the proper Switch version, but the basic concept is the same: it's a essentially physics-based fruit Tetris meets Threes, where you're dropping similar-looking fruits on top of one another to combine them into even larger fruits. 
The goal is to combine them enough times to get the big watermelon for mega points, but honestly, I'm not sure how much longer I can keep playing this free version of Suika, because so many of the fruits you meet along the way to the watermelon just look so gosh darn sad that it's breaking my heart a little. Then again, if I was a pear, I'd probably have a pretty sour-looking face, too, if I'm honest.

The release date was actually announced last week as part of The Indie Horror Showcase, and I have absolutely no idea how I missed it. Sucker for Love: First Date, if you recall, held a prestigious position as one of "Zoey Handley’s Top 10 Picks of 2022." It's a dating sim in which you perform arcane rituals to win the heart(s?) of an existential threat to humanity. I love it for its unique take on the genre, as well as its spot-on sense of humor.




Sucker for Love: Date to Die For has had a demo for yonks, but I've yet to try it. Rather than cast you as a lust-driven cultist trapped in their apartment, this one has you kidnapped and in need of escape. Damn, these ladies really know what I'm into. I wonder if Hastur will be in this one. The way she says "Yhtil" puts the wobble in my knees.


Sucker for Love: Date to Die For incorporates the 360-degree camera of Phasmophobia and includes more exploration. At the forefront of all the press is the dateable Rhok'zan, The Black Goat of the Woods. I'm down. I love a girl with horns.


I now have plans for Valentine's Day because Sucker for Love: Date to Die For is coming out on February 14, 2024 for PC.

You are basically collecting raw resources and pouring them into a bottomless maw. Despite that description, it's quite charming.

Your heroic gecko is a Stretchmancer, see, able to bend the dimensions of spaces to push walls far away and draw distant objects near. This is handy when trying to defeat an evil space empire. Stretchmancer is in a similar vein to Portal: a first-person puzzle-platformer which uses one neat trick to change how you see the world, and builds on that while a baddie taunts you. It's short, it's free, it's fun, and you might enjoy it slightly breaking your eyes.

After being announced back in August, Nightdive Studios and Lucasfilm Games have today revealed that Star Wars: Dark Forces Remaster will be blasting its way onto Switch next year on 28th February 2024.
Originally released on MS-DOS and Apple Macintosh in 1995, this remaster will see you taking on the role of Kyle Katarn, a member of the Rebel Alliance who infiltrates the Galactic Empire and discovers a sinister secret operation that will boost the Empire's power. It's classic Star Wars good vs. evil, right vs. wrong, with some retro FPS vibes to boot.

Developers Colossal Order upped the citybuilding sequel’s system requirements well in advance of launch, and more recently admitted to have "not achieved the benchmark we targeted" for PC performance. Instead, future improvements are promised, to patch Skylines 2 into better shape.
I wish I could say that this is all just pessimism, born from an overabundance of caution and expectation management. But no, it is just a bit of a mess, one capable of putting freshly mixed concrete shoes on even the fastest graphics cards. I’ve worked out a best settings guide that, compared to the available graphics presets, can better balance performance and visuals – though be warned that this will feel more like urgent repair work than a dream remodel.

If you’re a child of a certain age, you absolutely grew up wanting to strap on a Proton Pack and go bust some ghosts with your friends. There have been plenty of attempts to tap into the nostalgia for Ghostbusters over the years, and, while Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed isn’t the best of the bunch, it is a surprisingly fun multiplayer experience despite its shortcomings.
Switch users are finally getting the chance to step into the iconic firehouse with the Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed's 'Ecto Edition'. This version comes with all of the DLC released for the main game, including extra story content, cosmetics, ghost types, and maps to play on. The game follows an asymmetric 4v1 format, with four player-created Ghostbusters trying to stop the Ghost from fully haunting the location.

Just in case you somehow missed it, last week saw the release of both Super Mario Bros. Wonder and Marvel's Spider-Man 2. On the same day. For many of us, this resulted in an important decision between the two — which would be played first while the other took a back seat? Legendary games designer Masahiro Sakurai, however, found a simple answer: just smash through both.
After what must have been an intense weekend of gaming, the Smash Bros. creator has taken to Twitter to announce that he has beaten both games, and he considers each of them to be a masterpiece. Keeping it short but sweet, Sakurai goes on to say that both titles are an easy recommendation in his opinion, before thanking the developers — how polite!

However, some players have spotted a mishap related to one of the game's main protagonists, Miles Morales. His mother is Puerto Rican, and Miles is too, which is why some players found it odd that a Cuban flag hung both inside the Morales home and outside of it. After pointing it out the mistake, developer Insomniac Games has revealed a fix is on the way, as reported by PushSquare. 
In response to a tweet by Dantes61680 pointing out the incorrect flag, Insomniac's director of community and marketing James Stevenson wrote, "Fix is coming for that."

One of the Switch's most unique and interesting features is its ability to be used with a wide variety of controllers. You've got the standard Joy-Con, of course, but you can also use a Pro Controller, a Super NES pad, a HORI Switch Split Pad, and many, many more.
With the release of Super Mario Bros. Wonder just last week, many folks have come to realise just how compatible the game is with different controllers. Given that you don't have to use the analogue stick for movement and can quite easily get by with the d-pad (in fact, many would turn their noses up at the very notion of controlling a 2D Mario game with an analogue stick), this opens up a lot of avenues through which to control the game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Elder Scrolls 6 is going to be a mixture of new ideas and RPG systems that go all the way back to The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion, according to Bethesda's former design director Bruce Nesmith, who was lead designer on The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim and senior designer on Starfield. In particular, Nesmith reckons it will "absolutely" continue with Skyrim's approach to levelling and progression, whereby you improved skills by performing the associated actions. He also thinks the game will "probably" retain elements of the magic system he designed for Skyrim, which broke away from Oblivion and Morrowind in being simpler to understand and more immediately powerful, at the price of flexibility and inventiveness.

We've heard how Xbox wants to make gaming more accessible and with this in mind, Obsidian's studio design director Josh Sawyer has now responded to a question about the idea of the medieval role-playing title Pentiment coming to Switch.
Speaking to TouchArcade, he mentioned how there's nothing that would prevent it "technologically" being on Switch. As for his own personal thoughts, Sawyer would love to see the Xbox and PC exclusive on as many platforms as possible in the future:

With Mario and Sonic's latest releases now available, the focus this week turns to Konami's Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1.
If you are planning to check it out, we've got some early impressions courtesy of the first batch of reviews. While there aren't any Switch-specific ones included, it should still provide enough information about what to expect. Obviously, there are some differences in terms of the performance on Switch with select titles.

All we’ve seen it do is put together some bad prose, resurrect dead celebrities, and give us pictures that invariably look uncomfortably off. Humans can’t build a printer that can reliably put ink on a page, and we don’t need a machine’s help to wipe ourselves out of existence. We’ve got that covered.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the additions I like least in Spider-Man 2 is the web wings. The Spider-Man games, in general, have often strived to provide the best facsimile of the protagonist’s preferred mode of transportation, web swinging, so adding something like gliding to the mix is a bit of an affront to me. It’s a personal preference, but thankfully, I can mostly ignore the skill and just get around the old-fashioned way. I often forget it even exists.


However, while I was looking through Spider-Man 2’s various options to see if there is a way to turn off the visual wind-tunnel effects (there doesn’t seem to be), I did find something that might only appeal to strict swingers like myself. And that’s a Swing Steering Assist slider.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Magic: The Gathering is set to collaborate with Marvel in a deal that spans multiple decks and years. This news came courtesy of Wizards of the Coast via press release and a new, rather down-to-earth YouTube teaser video. 


Multiple Planes Makes For Easy Collabs


Focusing on the press release, fans won't have to wait too long for the first Marvel Universes Beyond collab deck. In 2025, WotC will release the first tentpole Magic set (a full card collection complete with boosters, starter decks, etc.) and continue to create new boosters and sets well into the future. No definitive end date was provided for this collaboration at this time.


President of WotC, Cynthia Williams, has the following to say regarding this collaboration, "We are extremely proud to collaborate with Marvel to bring its iconic characters to fans around the world in new ways. These tentpole sets will build on the tradition of incorporating beloved fan-favourite characters and elements from world-class brands into Magic: The Gathering."




The YouTube video, on the other hand, only provides a small tease rather than anything of substance. If any of the other Universes Beyond Magic the Gathering decks are anything to go by though, fans have little to worry about.


Universes Beyond is Wizard's of the Coast's ongoing crossover event with MTG. Each set takes major characters, places, and terms from the show and builds a full set around it with varying success. For anyone out of the know, recent properties to cross over are Doctor Who and Lord of the Rings with Fallout, Final Fantasy, and Assassin's Creed coming in the near future. So yes, players will be able to play two-headed giant matches of Clive and Altair versus one of the Doctors and Iron Man within a few years. What a time to be alive.

Se strahovskými bastlíři jste se mohli potkat na LinuxDays, kde jste si mohli zapájet demoboard s novým procesorem CH32V003 (RISC-V za deset centů, pro který mimochodem Vojta Suk napsal programátor běžící na Flipper Zero). Vyšlo Raspberry Pi 5 se spoustou inovací (i nových bugů), nový iPhone s Thread rádiem a USB-C místo Lightningu (který začali bastlíři hned hackovat) a v KiCADu už jde dělat databázové knihovny přes Inventree.

Ze světa hardwaru si můžete něco poslechnout o nových osciloskopech od Rigolu (a jak probíhá jejich hackování), nové knize o Micro:bit deskách, koprocesoru RP1 na Rapsberry Pi 5, novém Turrisu nebo jak si postavit reléovou ústřednu s ethernetem a SCPI. Možná dojde i na ukázku redukce mezi USB a komunistickou kopií GPIB známou jako IMS-2.

Pokud jde o měkčí stránku bastlířství, tedy software, představí bastlíři nový Node-RED. Nedávno se objevil také levný čínský radar schopný rozeznat více objektů najednou a proběhlo další kolo TinyTapeout, ve kterém je možné nechat si vyrobit vlastní ASIC.

Že byl tento měsíc velmi plodný a náročný, lze poznat i z toho, že tentokráte mají strahováci neobvykle málo bizarních témat, mezi nimiž tentokrát kralují ESD kroksy a masivně paralelní instalace Rapsberry Pi v průmyslovém prostředí, která samozřejmě skončila neslavně.

Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat ve středu 25. října od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.]]></summary>

In-between announcing a new job for expansion Dawntrail, revealing anecdotes from the early days of Final Fantasy and a whole bunch of crossovers on the way, Yoshi-P and Sakaguchi found time to kick back with some very silly hijinks during the game’s boss battles.

The LTC Neon75 is far from a big-brand choice, but the keyboard ticks all the boxes for me when it comes to features and design. There are beautiful 'pudding' keycaps, a compact and convenient 75% layout, tri-mode wired/wireless connectivity and hot-swappable key switches. Its US MSRP is a reasonable-sounding $70, but now it's available for a 50% off 'overstock' price on Amazon - that's just $35.

A Bombshell of a Crew


Video game adaptations have been hit or miss over the years. When we get The Last of Us, we also get Assassin's Creed. While they have been getting better over the years, it remains to be seen how long they'll hold out. Luckily, Fallout is shaping up to be another great adaptation, if the production is anything to go by.

It was one of those shows you’d find in the 6pm slot on terrestrial TV, back when you had to show up for TV episodes on time or miss them forever, and as far as 10-year-old me was concerned, 6pm was Simpsons hour. Who was this strutting Seattle intellectual, with his glass of sherry and his call-in psychiatry show and his passion for silverware?
I couldn’t abide Frasier and developed a pathological aversion to headliner (and surprisingly convincing X-Man) Kelsey Grammer – but that was before The Simpsons spoofed Frasier and showed me the error of my ways. I still wouldn’t say I’m an outright Frasier fan - or Frasien, as they prefer to be known. Some of the humour is kind of eeesh, in hindsight. But I’ve experienced and enjoyed enough to find Edward La Barbera’s Fraiser Fantasy pretty funny.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher CI Games has revealed that just ten days after releasing, Hexworks developed Soulslike RPG Lords of the Fallen has sold over one million units across all platforms. In my recent review I noted that while LotF has some issues, it also has its moments of greatness. Lords of the Fallen joins Lies of P as two recently released Soulslike titles to have crossed the one million unit mark.





"Lords of the Fallen is the most important and ambitious game we’ve developed in our 20-year history, and the first in our new planned AAA pipeline of games in the years ahead. o see this fresh and innovative take on the action-RPG achieve one million sales in just 10 days has been humbling for everybody at HEXWORKS and CI Games."
- Marek Tyminski, CEO, CI Games.



Surely one of the reasons Lords of the Fallen has seen some early success is Hexworks dedication to improving the game. Since its launch, several patches have been released on all platforms to improve performance as well as add new features. A revamped New Game Plus mode was just added to the Soulslike, as well as crossplay between PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.


Lords of the Fallen is available now on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While details are scarce at the moment, there's a possibility that Nvidia may unleash a SUPER variant of its RTX 4080 graphics card that has 20GB of RAM. That's if rumors from a number of sources are to be believed.


Speculations were shared by Videocardz (which originally came from Benchlife as well as a source on Twitter/X). It appears as though some information has fallen into the hands of leakers who assert that the boosted RTX 4080 is in the works.




Nvidia hasn't confirmed any of this at the time of writing. Suffice it to say, many grains of salt should be consumed while chewing this latest information.


Either a SUPER or a Ti


It's also looking like this elusive new model could sport the full AD102 chip, the same one used in the RTX 4090. The current 4080 uses AD103, so – as Videocardz says – the potential SUPER variant would need the AD102 GPU if it hopes to squeeze in 20GB of memory.


It's also worth noting that sources have not specifically said that it will be part of the SUPER series, so it could even be a Ti. In any case, temper expectations for now until Nvidia makes a formal statement about these rumors.


Speculations about the potential Nvidia graphics card were doing the rounds recently. We also know that Team Green had to "unlaunch" a 12GB version of the RTX 4080 about a year ago.


The 4000 series – named "Ada Lovelace" after the 19th century English mathematician – kicked off in October 2022. We've had a number of product launches since then, including a couple of Ti models. However, we've yet to have a SUPER, so it could be high-time for one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hexworks are making some pretty comprehensive adjustments to fantasy Soulslike RPG Lords of the Fallen, rejigging the AI so that enemies won't pursue you quite as far when you run past them, and patching how the New Game Plus options work to give players more control over the difficulty curve. The game's latest patch, out now, allows you to choose whether to progress to a harder NG+ setting after finishing a run, or restart at the same difficulty threshold while retaining your character and progression. 


"This will allow trophy hunters and completionists to seek out any outstanding tasks without having to contend with increased difficulty, should they so choose," the developers say in Lords of the Fallen's latest patch notes. And these are just the first of "some fundamental changes to ensure everyone continues to enjoy the NG+ experience", according to Hexworks. Heft that magic lantern and read on.

In what was likely an attempt to represent co-protagonist Miles Morales’ Puerto Rican heritage, the Cuban flag was displayed in the character’s apartment instead.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As Rare famously discovered back in the 90s, if you stick a pair of eyes on an inanimate object, it immediately becomes the most adorable thing you've ever seen in your life. Take Subpar Pool's cue ball. What could have been just a straightforward mash-up of pool meets golf is suddenly given a new lease of life, warmth, charm and character, just because it has little eyes and a dumb, goofy smile plastered on its face. Some of its 'Chonker'-sized pool balls even have coiffed miniature moustaches for crying out loud, and they all babble cute nonsense noises at you as you ping them around its procedurally generated boards; hrnnnnngh they're just so gosh darn endearing that I simply cannot help myself. They make Subpar Pool a very easy game to like, which is precisely why it's so heartbreaking I can't quite bring myself to love it in the same way I do Grapefrukt Games' previous puzzle game, Holedown.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've been looking at the current crop of Silent Hill sequels, remakes and remasters and pining for the foggy streets and busted doorknobs of yesteryear, I recommend trying the demo for Heartworm. This is survival horror just the way Mother used to make it - before Mother read all those forbidden books and decided to sacrifice you to Samael, Lord of Serpents and Reeds. You've got your 3D engine with fixed camera perspectives, your thick coating of TV static, your sluggish vehicular control scheme, your enemies that could be either demons or metaphors and will murder you either way. 


There's a big dollop of Resident Evil here, too, and a gentler dusting of Fatal Frame. The main character is driven by grief, sports a fiesty tank-and-shorts combo, and is equipped with a flash camcorder for exorcising spooks rather than a firearm. In other words, she's the point on the Venn diagram between Jill Valentine, Miku Hinasaki and Harry Mason. The individual camera choices are more Evil than Hilly: the game frequently switches to a close-up face-on perspective when you enter a room, forcing you to step into the blindspot. That endless inter-dimensional staircase, though? Pure Team Silent. Other influences include Half-Life, Puppet Combo and Donnie Darko.


I'm pretty sold on Heartworm, though I'm still waiting for it to spark its own identity from all those grated-together shards of older horror games. So it's a bit sad that the project is in enormous trouble.

        <updated>2023-10-23T15:15:55.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever since one Escape From Tarkov player publicly revealed their findings that up to 60% of Tarkov matches might play host to cheaters, the community has taken a more negative stance towards the developer, Battlestate Games. Now, Battlestate Games has announced that its more focused and hectic Escape From Tarkov: Arena title will be coming out sometime in December 2023, and the players are highly suspicious of this claim.


The news broke when Forbes covered a recent interview with the Battlestate Games CEO, Nikita Buyanov, stating that "Early December is a good period of time that we want to release [Arena]." This soon made its way onto the r/pcgaming subreddit, where Tarkov players flocked to share their takes on what's actually bound to happen with Arena.


What to make of Escape From Tarkov: Arena?


"For anyone uninitiated," said Reddit user bauN7, "Battle State Games has been late on every single timeline they've ever given for Tarkov. Literally every. Single. One." Aside from the matters of release date windows, the players are also cynical about the value that Arena may or may not be adding to Tarkov as a whole. 


The situation is similarly dire on the official Tarkov subreddit, where players are admittedly being more technical in their critique at least. TheJigglyfat highlighted a situation in which Tarkov's emblematic desync issues caused massive differences between what two different players were seeing, which means that the match was effectively decided by lag live on stream.


It's not a great look, then, but the community's jadedness isn't necessarily a sign that BSG will have trouble managing Arena as well. In the end, if push comes to shove, at least the single-player offline version of Tarkov seems to be prospering well enough.

October 23, 2023
As is the case with many high-profile video game adaptations, the project is attached to some pretty big names. Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy (the married duo behind Westworld) are executive producers, along with Bethesda Game Studios' own Todd Howard. The show will star Walton Goggins (Justified) and Ella Purnell, who fans of gaming will recognize as the voice of Jinx in the critically acclaimed League of Legends series Arcane. Filming for the series began in July 2022.
Over the past few years, video game adaptations have been getting better and better. This year is no different, with HBO's The Last of Us and The Super Mario Bros. Movie being two of the biggest hits of the entire year. Hopefully, Fallout with follow suit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When it comes to the topic of the best horror games of the last PlayStation era, Alien: Isolation typically ranks high. And why wouldn't it? With its terrifying atmosphere, deadly antagonist, and choo-choo train, its horror is as memorable as it is intense.


Wait. What was that last thing?


Ah, that's right. Trains. You see, it turns out someone decided to swap out the Xenomorph in Alien: Isolation for the less sinister-looking Thomas the Tank Engine.


Image via MattFiler



The mod comes courtesy of ModDB user MattFiler, with the rationale that this was something that just "had to happen sooner or later." A short video on the download page shows the new model in action. It doesn't quite have the finesse of the titular alien creature, but it still retains an element of dread and danger.


Thomas the Tank Engine horror is still horror


It might look a little goofy, but it reminds me (as I'm sure it will many of you) of the famous Skyrim mod that did something similar to Alduin. Then there's Choo-Choo Charles, the 2022 horror game about a killer train.


There's something about taking a loveable fictional character from many childhood memories and putting them in a different context. In this case, horror. While not many Alien: Isolation players are happy about being downed by the frighteningly fast creature, it's also not preferable to be the target of Thomas.


Of course, the spooky season is almost upon us, so we can probably expect to see some other mash-up of innocence and terror. Maybe the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles can make us piss ourselves in Outlast.

But I appreciate that while I might not get on with them, many others will enjoy the bite of an olive on its own, or the increased airflow to their larynx as they chortle at Joey doing the silly thing he does at Rachel, or whatever. Ghostrunner 2, a first-person cyberpunk slasher and sequel to Ghostrunner, has joined the echelon of things that aren't for me but might be for you.
That's because the game's relentlessly unforgiving, and sets margins so small you're rarely afforded much freedom. Sometimes it really does put you in the RGB kicks of a cyber ninja as you dash between the halves of cyborgs you've cleaved in two, but these moments can often be the weary culmination of agonising trial and error. If you're into that, great! If you're not, then I'd slink back into that shadow.

There's this electrifying sensation that comes with needing to perfect a level or section because dying is the alternative. Ghostrunner managed to capture this feeling while remaining a solid first-person platformer on top of that. 


If anything, it was the first 3D title to give me that kind of tension since the only other games to scratch that itch were Hotline Miami and Katana Zero. Ghostrunner wasn't perfect, but I was ready for a sequel by the time it was announced. 


Now the aptly named Ghostrunner 2 is here, and with it that rush so few games captured for me. At first, I wasn't sure what to think of it, but playing its demo reeled me in. That snippet felt like Ghostrunner but more, and that was all I could ask f…]]></summary>

The Xbox Partner Preview will air at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET on Wednesday, October 25 for roughly 20 minutes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following Spider-Man 2's successful launch last week, PlayStation has revealed just how impactful the game was. In the first 24 hours alone, the game sold over 2.5 million copies. This makes it the fastest-selling title from PlayStation's first-party studios. 




Numbers from the UK are also impressive. GameIndustry.biz reveals that Spider-Man 2 clenched the top spot when it comes to physical sales in the UK, surpassing Super Mario Bros Wonder. It also had 5% greater sales than Hogwarts Legacy on PS5. Overall, it is the 4th biggest physical launch in the UK this year, surpassed by Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, EA Sports FC24, and Hogwarts Legacy on all platforms.


Spider-Man 2's success is a product of some wise choices made by Sony over the years. It purchased the Spider-Man IP from Marvel in 1999 for $7 million which has turned out to be an incredibly advantageous move. Years later, Sony then tapped Insomniac to develop a new Spider-Man game, leading to the PS4 game. Not long after the studio was purchased by Sony for $229 million. 


Insomniac has proven itself yet again, but the studio isn't ready to sleep yet. Superhero fans can also look forward to Wolverine which is currently in development.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 has only been available for three days, but the critically acclaimed sequel has already become the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game in the brand’s history.
In a press release, Sony Interactive Entertainment states that over 2.5 million copies of the game have been sold within the first 24 hours of launch. The publisher didn’t provide a breakdown in terms of physical vs digital, but that’s an impressive number for the PS5 exclusive.
This feat continues the series' record-setting trend; 2018's Spider-Man also became the fastest-selling first-party PS title at the time (for PS4 specifically with 3.3 million sold within the first three days of launch) and, later, became the best-selling superhero game ever in the U.S., a record it still holds today. Time will tell if this sequel can supplant its predecessor, but it's off to a strong start regardless.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you want an example of how gothic and devilish gaming can get, look no further than Diablo 4. The recent installment in Blizzard's celebrated action-RPG series is literally collecting blood, with some potential hardware to come from it.


A recent video on the Diablo YouTube channel invites players to donate blood (presumably their own) to their local clinic. In doing so, rewards will be on offer. From donating blood.




To take that a step further, the studio is also looking to put together a custom PC that's liquid cooled by 666 quarters of real human blood. Anyone interested in taking part will need to show proof of their donation before the end of November 20.


Developers literally asking for a blood sacrifice


A website set up by the Diablo 4 team gives further details about the publicity stunt. According to the FAQ, you don't technically have to donate in order to get the rewards. This is simply about enough people donating to reach a required amount.


A post on Twitter/X says that the in-game rewards "will be unlocked for all players as we progress toward our donation goal." The custom-built PC is the endgame of all this. 


As for the specs, it sounds like it's going to be a pretty beefy system. It'll boast an Nvidia RTX 4090 graphics card, an Intel Core i9-13900K CPU, 64GB of RAM, and 3TB of M.2 SSD storage. Also, did I mention the human blood that's going to course through it? I'm pretty sure I mentioned the human blood that's going to course through it.

Right now, it’s slated for PS5 and Steam, and while I can’t find a release window, there’s a demo available starting today.


You play as Mara Forest, an investigator brave enough to search an abandoned amusement park in a short, white dress. She’s searching for the eccentric and elusive Edward Crow, a wealthy man who financed the eponymous amusement park, Crow Country. The amusement park has been left to rot for over a year, and I’m pretty sure you find out why in the demo, but I can’t remember, and I forgot to save the footage I took. Spooky!


That’s right! I got an early hands-on with the demo. It’s a rather beefy chunk of the game’s opening. It pl…]]></summary>

Specifically, the Legend Haunted Lost Sectors have made a return from last year's Festival of the Lost and some of the community is well and truly fed up with them already.


Legend Haunted Lost Sectors are, essentially, just what it says on the tin: a heavily souped-up version of the regular Lost Sector missions with a bit of Halloween pizzaz plastered on top. They wouldn't even be particularly offensive as a side activity to accompany a full-fledged Festival of the Lost event, but Bungie instead introduced them as a replacement to the Haunted Forest, which veteran players may remember. As it now stands, Legend Haunted Lost Secto…]]></summary>

Over the decade since A Realm Reborn’s release, its reputation has grown with every single expansion. FFXIV’s producer and director Naoki Yoshida (more commonly known as Yoshi P) is now so synonymous with the game that it’s easy to forget he was only brought onto the project in 2010 - after XIV had been released, to overwhelmingly negative reviews.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been 11 long years since the unveiling of Squadron 42, Star Citizen's singleplayer campaign, seven years since developer Cloud Imperium Games broke Squadron 42 off into a standalone purchase, five years since Crytek took them to court for allegedly breaching their CryEngine license, three years since Crytek and Cloud Imperium settled that lawsuit, and three years since director Chris Roberts sought to justify the game's mammoth development time to Kickstarter backers, declaring that "it would be doing a huge disservice to everyone working really hard on the project and all of you that are looking forward to it to deliver something that isn't great." Well, all that waiting has finally paid off, as Squadron 42 is now officially... "feature-complete" and "into the polishing phase", meaning that the Wing Commander-inspired space sim is almost guaranteed to release before the death of our sun.


Cloud Imperium have released a new trailer walkthrough to celebrate, which does admittedly look spaceworthy. It's a whistle-stop tour of Squadron 42 gameplay and story materials - from dogfights in asteroid belts that use a new precision targeting feature, through "OMG my CO is Gillian Anderson" cinematics, to physics-based puzzling malarkey involving a Half-Life Gravity Gun-adjacent gizmo. If I were, say, Starfield developer Bethesda, I'd be particularly worried about those planetary surface flyovers. Mind you, by the time Squadron 42 launches we'll probably be playing Starfield 2. I kid, Roberts, I kid!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Metal Gear franchise has been quiet since 2018's somewhat bizarre Metal Gear Survive. The series' creator, Hideo Kojima, publicly left Konami in 2015 shortly after the release of Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain and since then fans just weren't sure what to expect, or even if to expect anything from the property. That changed recently when Konami finally revealed some plans for the franchise. Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater is being remade and retitled Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, and the Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Volume 1 is releasing this week.
The collection contains the NES and MSX releases of Metal Gear, Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake, Snake's Revenge, Metal Gear Solid, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, and additional bonuses like soundtracks, scripts, and more. It's far from a complete collection of all things Metal Gear (hence the Volume 1 part of the title, presumably), but it arguably finally gives players access to the best of Metal Gear's past on modern consoles. The game releases on Xbox Series X, Switch, and PC October 24, but ahead of that release, Alex Van Aken (a Metal Gear newcomer) joined me (an old Metal Gear sicko) for an extended look at almost everything the collection offers.
We had early access to the PlayStation 5 version of the game and you can check out the full video below:

It features the likes of EA’s Mirror’s Edge series, Respawn Entertainment’s Titanfall franchise, and One More Level’s Ghostrunner – one of my fav orite games. I first played this game two years after its 2020 release, in the summer of July 2022, jobless and depressed. It felt good to exist in a world where capitalistic business executives make inhumane decisions about the last of humanity living in their Dharma Tower, except instead of suffering under their thumb, I, or rather, protagonist Ghostrunner, took a katana straight to the top to bring it all down. The game concludes with humanity free and Ghostrunner liberated from the A.I.-powered Cybervoid trappings under a new name: Jack.

Notably, Spider-Man 2 takes place on the same open-world map as the first game and its quasi-sequel, Miles Morales. That being New York City. Similar to how Ryu Ga Gotoku Studios handles its primary Kamurocho open world in the Like a Dragon (formerly Yakuza) series, Insomniac opted for an iteration over reinvention approach for its New York City – with some big changes. Those changes are the additions of the Queens and Brooklyn boroughs on top of the existing Manhattan map and the switch from PlayStation 4 to exclusively PlayStation 5 (Spider-Man 1 and Miles Morales are also on PS5, but cross-platform). It's on a much larger ma…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer One More Level and publisher 505 Games have pulled back the DLC curtain plans for its upcoming first-person parkour-action game, Ghostrunner 2, ahead of its release next week. As previously announced, all Brutal Edition owners of Ghostrunner 2 will get the Season Pass, which includes all of the DLC announced today. Otherwise, the Season Pass will cost $19.99.
As for what to expect, One More Level has revealed four cosmetic packs and a new way to play the game called Endless Moto Mode. Given that we know Ghostrunner 2 features a motorbike for protagonist Jack to ride, we're guessing this new mode has something to do with that. In each cosmetic pack, players will receive three sword skins, three hand skins, and one motorcycle skin. The first one – Ice Pack – goes live in-game on December 7. 
Check out the Ghostrunner 2 Season Pass trailer for yourself below: 


Sometime in February, the Dragon Pack will go live followed by the Heat Pack in June of next year. The Endless Moto Mode is due out sometime in September of 2024, with the Anniversary Pack following it in October. 
Buying the Brutal Edition of Ghostrunner 2 gets you all of this DLC and 48-hours of early access to the game, meaning you can jump in starting October 24 ahead of the game's standard October 26 release date. 
For more, check out the Ghostrunner 2 soundtrack list (and listen to a full song from it right now), and then watch this gameplay trailer from earlier this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Obsidian Entertainment design director Josh Sawyer has said that he'd be well up for making a new Pillars of Eternity RPG, given a budget on par with Baldur's Gate 3. Specifically, he'd like to build on Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire's combat system, and use a "scripted 3D camera" that avoids some of the fuss of exploring the world and navigating the interface of Larian's game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gaurav* wakes up at 4am on Saturdays and Sundays. His routine is the same each time. He quickly turns off his alarm. He slowly shuffles out of bed, keeping the light off to avoid waking his wife and his 18-month-old son. He goes out through the bedroom door, and along the hall, to his office. He sits back in his chair, and he gets high. 


In the last nine months, Gaurav has spent £2,000 on his secret addiction. He admits to a total spend over eight years of more than double that. That is, £4,250 is the amount he admits to when talking to me – he’s never told his family. But Gaurav isn’t addicted to drugs, or alcohol or even online poker. The reason Gaurav only gets a few hours of sleep each weekend, is because he can’t stop playing FIFA Ultimate Team.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I loved the premise of Deadnaut. It's the tactility of chunky spaceship interfaces combined with the frustration of the corporation cheaping out on everything and not caring that it'll get everyone killed. It's the desperate crews exploring derelicts out on the fringes of the known, where terrible, unspeakable things have been unleashed. Alien by way of Duskers.
I didn't love playing it, though. It was too frantic, too awkward, too short. Deadnaut Colon Signal Lost changes all those things and more. It's more like a re-interpretation of its own ideas than a direct sequel. Consequently, it's sanded off a little of its unique nature, but overall is a much better game.
Even though it's a bloody roguelike. Godddd.

I've read a few sci-fi novels in my time, and have come to the conclusion that tunnelling into other dimensions is seldom a wise move, but there's no turning back at the threshold when you're nurturing a mighty galactic empire, I guess. Find a trailer below in which some poor science ship pilot gets his brain fried by a crackling window of purple impossibility.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the beginning of September, the soundtrack for Tunic disappeared from streaming services. The composers, Lifeformed and Janice Kwan, said they'd received several false DMCA takedown notices for their work, which had resulted in the removal of both Tunic's soundtrack from numerous platforms, as well as three more of their albums. For a while, things looked very uncertain about the likelihood of their soundtracks returning. Left without much recourse against their distributor, the composers eventually filed a counterclaim to try and better protect their work and get them back online. Thankfully, they were successful, and all four soundtracks are back where they belong.  
It's been a messy saga about that's highlighted several issues about how DMCA claims can be manipulated like this, and they're not the only ones it's happened to recently, either. Fortunately for the Tunic duo at least, the situation's since been resolved and their soundtracks are now back where they belong - and to celebrate, they've released a whole new set of Tunic tracks that they describe as "initial piano concepts" for some of its major themes. And hey. You know me. I love a good piano collection of a video game soundtrack, so it is probably no surprise whatsoever that I've more or less had this on repeat for the last month. It's so, so, so good.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The latest Pokémon Trading Card Game expansion in the Scarlet & Violet series is nearly here, bringing more than 180 new cards. Paradox Rift features new Ancient and Future Pokémon, playing off a story element of the Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet games, as well as type-shifted Tera Pokémon EX cards to play off one of the core mechanics of the latest-generation video games. 
Speaking of Pokémon EX cards, Paradox Rift offers more than 15 new Pokémon EX cards, but it doesn't stop there. Collectors and players alike can also expect more than 20 new Trainer cards, as well as 15 special illustration rare Pokémon and Supporter cards and 28 ultra rare full-art etched Pokémon EX and Supporter cards. There are even seven hyper-rare gold-etched cards to cross your fingers for.
The Pokémon Company sent along a bunch of booster packs from the Paradox Rift expansion for us to open in order to see what we could pull. After the last expansion focused squarely on the original 151 Pokémon, Paradox Rift largely shines the spotlight elsewhere (though a few Kanto creatures still show up). I loved the Yveltal and Garchomp EX cards I pulled, but my favorite is probably the Armarouge EX. I also loved the Ancient and Future Pokémon, but I'm disappointed the ones I pulled weren't foils. However, the gold-etched Iron Valiant EX card more than made up for that.
Check out my favorite pulls in the gallery below:

The publisher have also now launched the hitherto Battle.net-based PC version on Steam, and are trying to attract newcomers with a discount on Valve's platform and a free 10 hour trial this weekend (that's 19th-22nd October) for Xbox players.


Have the Season 2 updates - which you could summarise as "slay vampires to get vampire powers" and "spend less time and have more fun grinding/farming for loot and levels" - salvaged Blizzard's action-RPG from the ashes of Season 1? I've been trawling the reactions this morning, and while the new Diablo appears to be evolving in the right direction, the big picture is still of a game with just as many raters as haters.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cor, it sure is good to be back in Commander Video’s running shoes again. I know Bit.Trip Runner and Choice Provisions’ assorted Bit.Trip rhythm games have been available on Steam for absolutely yonks (and still are, in fact), but my memories of these are all on the Nintendo Wii. That’s where I encountered most of the games first - and I haven’t really been back since. I dabbled in Runner 2 on the Wii U, but positively bounced off the 3D-ness of Runner 3 when it came to PC, preferring instead the clean, simple lines of its stark pixel sprites. 
It's with some surprise, then, that I’ve had such a good time with Bit.Trip ReRunner, the recently released fancied up version of the auto-running original that brings its rhythmic courses kicking and screaming into that third dimension. But it’s really more of a compilation game than anything else, packing in extra protein in the form of EP soundtracks and freshly-created course selections from all eight games in the series (mashing tunes from Beat, Core, Void, Fate, Flux into a Runner-style format), as well as lots of new tricks and abilities up its sleeve. But the crown jewel in ReRunner isn’t so much the joy of getting a fresh dose of OG Runner again, but seeing what its player base has already started making with its brilliant Runner Maker level editor. Yep, much like Super Mario Maker before it, Bit.Trip has opened itself up to the whims of would-be game making audience, and they are running with it (sorry).

Wonder is out now, and if you're anything like us, you're playing through it, trying to find every secret the game has to offer (read our review right here). The two main collectibles come in the form of 10 Flower Coins and Wonder Seeds. Each main stage has three 10 Flower Coins for you to collect, while each main stage features at least two Wonder Seeds for you to grab. While the Wonder Seeds are tied to each exit a stage has, you also get one for collecting a Wonder Flower and completing the corresponding Wonder Effect.

Motive released its Dead Space remake earlier this year, and Klaus says with that behind them, the studio's focus "has switched to the Iron Man project, giving us the opportunity to work (and play!) with another extraordinary property." He says the team is still in early pre-production and taking its time to set the best possible foundation for development, but despite that, it is finding "so many opportunities to explore story, design, and gamep…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One Punch Man is great and often hilarious manga/anime about Saitama, the namesake of the franchise, who defeats every foe he encounters with one punch. It functions both as a great parody of anime characters who are constantly struggling to become stronger and as great action anime on its own. As a video game, however, it struggles somewhat as Saitama must defeat everyone in one punch, which isn't particularly fun gameplay, forcing you to play as the many other characters of the franchise, who sadly aren't Saitama.
One Punch Man: World is currently in closed beta and while it doesn't particularly solve any of those issues, it does look great and showcase some impressive action. It is a free-to-play game, though, which means there are gacha mechanics and lots of different currencies to deal with. Join Marcus Stewart and me as we check out the game and share our thoughts on the One Punch Man anime.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lords of the Fallen developers Hexworks are still busily carving a path through the game’s various bugs and performance issues. The latest Lords of the Fallen update, Patch v.1.1.207, is a thrilling litany of technical gremlins that have now been tracked down and slaughtered.


Amongst other things, the developers have turned off collision detection for an entire library, to avoid tanking the frame-rate when you - for reasons best known only to yourself - attack the books. In other news, the game will no longer crash itself in "revenge" when you hit walls too often (a rare, and rather amusing-sounding bug - best be wary when looking for secret rooms I guess). Hexworks have also identified the source of a crashing problem when playing Lords of the Fallen on Steam Deck, though the fix for that particular issue hasn’t yet passed QA. Oh, and they've made the continue button "sexier". Look, don't ask me, I just work here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cities: Skylines the game that defined the city building genre in the wake of Sim City's self-destruction never truly grabbed me. It’s important to say that, because it helps with the context, and it’s context that I’m struggling with. For a follow-up, Cities: Skylines 2 is basically good. I’ll even continue playing it, which isn’t that common after a review, especially for such a timesink. This time around, it has grabbed me, and yet it's such a small step forward that I don't feel entirely comfortable recommending it outright.

These keyboards are normally available around the $70 mark, but today you can pick one up from Amazon in black for $48 - a good deal for a full-size mechanical keyboard from a major brand.

It's less about mere familiarity than you'd think, given how late I first played it. Sid Meier’s Alpha Centauri By Sid Meier endures partly because its design has aged well, but mostly because it's an unusually human 4X strategy. Its high concept story asks for interpretation, for a philosophical response. Where so many others are about the arbitrary icons of nationalism, or stock elves/insectoids/robots, it's a game about ideology and personality. Where a sequel to Civilization's "send a colony ship into space" ending could have asked "what if lasers and aliens", Alpha Centauri instead asked: Where is humanity going?

In the technical world of city-builders, 2015’s Cities: Skylines made a name for itself as an uncompromising but delicate game where players needed to spin a variety of municipal plates to keep things in order across their fantasy cities. Eight years and millions of digital building permits later, Colossal Order has returned to construct a convincing sequel in Cities: Skylines II.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Space Tales is a new real-time strategy game from Vietnam-based Saigon Dragon, who worked with Numantian Games to develop the brilliant They Are Billions. In They Are Billions, you scraped together walls and turrets to hold off a world's worth of undead, and prolong the miserable lives of a tiny handful of non-zombified humans at your settlement's core. Space Tales is breezier of demeanour - like the confusingly named 2014 RTS Space Rogue, it takes inspiration from 1940s retro-futurism, with brightly coloured maps and chunky chrome unit design. But there are similarly grim overtones. The game puts you in charge of a Starship Troopers-esque expeditionary force, carving out secure nooks on very-much-inhabited alien planets and flogging them as holiday destinations.

For our larger theme we discuss games that flip-reverse their theme when you least expect it, which is usually seemingly-cute games becoming horror - much like Harvest Island.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After busting down the castle door with their chaotic, siege-based citybuilder Diplomacy Is Not An Option last year, the last thing I expected to see next from developers Door 407 was a chill, meditative puzzle game that's just about, well, building tiny cities. In Urbo there are no sky lasers, no oncoming hordes. Nothing. Just dinky little grid-based maps, and an endless stream of tiny adorable buildings to plonk down on them in the pursuit of sweet, sweet point scores.
This being a puzzle game, the aim here is to place three buildings of the same type altogether, either in a line or right-angled cluster, at which point they'll all shzooge together to level up to the next building type. This is where the Threes comparison comes in, though you can zhuzh more than three of the same building together if you're smart to earn more points. But it's not quite as simple as that. You see, your buildings will only shoump onto the tile you placed down last, and careful city planners will likely want to think about placing their buildings in reverse so they end up with their fancy new house in the place they actually want it, not in an awkward middle spot that cuts off two precious tiles from play, or awkwardly sits in the middle of another chain of dwellings accidentally. And yep, that's where the Dorfromantik connection comes in, and I really do like it very, very much.

We loved it – read Game Informer's review of it here – and are excited for everyone to get their hands on it. Yesterday, we learned Insomniac Games recommends players download the day one patch for the "best experience" before starting the first mission, and now, we've learned when to expect the fan-favorite New Game Plus feature in the sequel. 
As first reported by PlayStation Lifestyle, someone asked Insomniac Games community director James Stevenson if New Game Plus and mission replay will be in the game at launch. Stevenson said, "No, we're working on an update for those features but they won't be in Day 1."
No - we’re working on an update for those features but they won’t be in Day 1
October 17, 2023
After someone on Twitter expressed their disappointment in the replies, Stevenson clarified that New Game Plus was not a Day 1 feature in the original Marvel's Spider-Man, but instead a mode added roughly six weeks after launch. 
Someone else asked Stevenson on Twitter if New Game Plus is coming this year or 2024 and Stevenson said it "should be before end of year."
Should be before end of year

It's kinda like the roguelikelike slot machine Luck Be A Landlord dressed for a Halloween party in a turn-based tactics costume. Million Monster Militia is ropey in its current early access stage, but I have enjoyed discovering weird builds and I am cautiously curious about its future after some updates.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following three years solely on the Epic Games Store, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2’s recent Steam launch was a largely happy occasion – save for it carrying over the same always-online requirement as it has on Epic. Yesterday’s 1.1 patch for the Steam version has now made offline play possible, but in a move that simultaneously makes loads of and absolutely no sense, it’s only available on the Steam Deck.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In addition to preventing pirate IPTV services from being watched anywhere in the country, a new Italian law requires authorities to run educational anti-piracy awareness campaigns. Released this week, the first PSA uses a famous Italian footballer to inform the "common man" that piracy has consequences. As things stand, he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

The free cooking game Little Chef disagreed, and dubbed my dish 'Eggy Mess'. Everyone's a critic. But it's fun to puzzle out potential recipes, dragging ingredients into the pot, brushing my cursor against little physics-simulated spoons and plant fronds, and discovering what fresh horror I've concocted. It's free and playable in your browser, so hie thee to Itch.io and get experimenting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Immersive sims like Dishonored or System Shock can be very fulfilling, but they are also oddly stressful. After all, the flipside of the genre mantra of solving problems through imaginative application of the tools is that when you achieve a boring solution, that's all your fault. Did you miss the final jump while trying for a complex, third-storey infiltration in Deathloop, resulting in a sadly non-immersive firefight in the courtyard below? Did you fail to combo those magical abilities and terrain variables as the developers hoped - nay, dreamed you would, forcing you to rely on ye olde cover-shoot tactics to reach the checkpoint? Shame on you! Don't you know how much imsims cost to develop? Go back to Open-Ended Systems School and retake that course in The Power of Choice. Also, consider playing Mosa Lina instead.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The 7th Guest is a 1993 puzzle adventure game that was released on PCs in 1993, just a few months before Myst. It was an early instance of a fully modeled 3D location, and its use of FMV actors for its cast felt like you were looking into the future of video games. It received a few underwhelming sequels and other adaptions, but The 7th Guest VR marks arguably its biggest and boldest reimagining. Effectively a remake, this version of the game takes the familiar locations and story and adds in new puzzles and new performances. Considering the original game (and this remake) is about exploring a spooky house and solving puzzles, it feels at home in VR. You can watch Wes LeBlanc and me check out the game below.
For a whole lot more on The 7th Guest, you can read our oral history of the game right here. You can also take a look at this translated interview between Mario and Zelda creator, Shigeru Miyamoto, and Spirited Away director, Hayao Miyazaki, from the early 90s where Miyamoto called the game "inspiring".

Newegg are currently offering a deal on Corsair's SF1000L, a compact 1000W 80+ Gold rated fully modular power supply - it's down to $150, from $180. 
That's still a lot, but this is quite a fair price for a 1kW PSU from a well-known manufacturer, let alone an SFX-L one as these are often more expensive due to their level of miniaturisation that is required. This basically allows you to use even the most energy-intensive CPUs or GPUs available*.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Asus make some of the best gaming laptops going, and their Flow Z13 (discounted today!) is one of the most interesting too. It's an ultraportable 13-inch machine with high-end specs, a 1200p (1920x1200) 120Hz touchscreen and a detchable keyboard. Plug in Asus' discrete GPU (or any other eGPU solution), and you're left with an extremely powerful gaming machine - then unplug and you've got a thin and light laptop for getting work done or consuming media on the go. Nice. 
Anyway, this laptop retailed for $1300 when it first debuted last year, but now it's down to $700 at Woot in the US. That's a substantial savings and a good deal for a 13-inch laptop with a Core i5 12500H CPU, 16GB of DDR5 RAM and a 512GB NVMe SSD.

That wasn't all, though; The snippets of composer David Housden's score in the reveal trailer indicated this team was on to something. 
It was clear from the first listen that Housden and Dlala put a lot of effort into making Illusion Island sound like Disney. What's more, it replicated not just the broader stroke that anyone can hear and go, "Oh, that sounds like Disney music," but instead created something wholly original that simultaneously sounded…]]></summary>

The collaboration also includes a Le Sserafim-inspired custom game mode for Overwatch 2 and exclusive in-game items like hero skins. More details about the in-game events will arrive on October 30, according to Blizzard, but the content goes live for players on November 1. 
"We're extremely excited to be working with Le Sserafim for our game's first musical artist collaboration," Overwatch general manager Walter Kong writes in a press release. "Like the heroes of Overwatch, the Le Sserafim members are amazing as individuals, but unstoppable when they come together." 
Blizzard says Le Sserafim will also make an appearance at this year's BlizzCon on November 4 to perform "Perfect Night," as well as other songs, in the BlizzCon Arena following the conclusion of Community Night. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's Overwatch 2 review and then read about the company's celebration of Overwatch 2's first anniversary. 
[Editor's Note: This story has been updated to clarify that Le Sserafim will perform "Perfect Night" during BlizzCon and other songs]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Being as much of an insufferable, online-but-ultimately-in-quite-a-basic-way person as I am, I'm a Junji Ito girlie. The horror manga artist has an immediately recognisable style that intersects detailed, line heavy art with strange and upsetting concepts, and some of his short stories have acquired a sort of semi-memetic status ("This is my hole! It was made for me!"). If you're at all familiar with Junji Ito's work you will look at unforgiving almost-text-adventure World Of Horror and go "Huh, that's inspired by Junji Ito."
This isn't just because it looks like his work but rendered in MSPaint, or because it contains, just, direct references to it, but because of the whole vibe. You encounter face-sloughing-off kinds of monsters and vengeful spirits inspired by Japanese folkloric yokai, but also weirdo janitors doing stuff like turning the swim team into mermaids in a kind of pervier version of Tusk. At the same time, there's a streak of the Lovecraftian in play to keep it nice and legally distinct, as each self-contained run at the titular world is an attempt to save your town from destruction at the hands of an Old God (they earn the leaden thud of the capital letters). You will fail a lot. But isn't failure part of the fun!? Imagine that enthusiastic question as a big spoonful of marmite popped into your mouth.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's rare that a developer explicitly introduces their game to you as "boring", and Indika seems anything but. Created by Odd Meter, the studio behind the well-received fantasy VR bow simulator Sacralith: The Archer's Tale, and published by Frostpunk developer 11 bit Studios, it's a "very serious adventure game" set in 19th century Russia, which casts you as a young Orthodox Christian nun on the run. Awash with doubts about her faith, and persecuted by a mysterious creature, the woman flees her nunnery and falls in with an escaped convict, who tells her of a mysterious "holy elder" who might ease her troubles, drawing on the power of a sacred artefact.
The game's setting is naturalistic, with motion-captured facial animations and photorealistic buildings and interiors, wrought using Unreal Engine. But it is also a "fairy tale" landscape, in the words of studio co-founder Dmitry Setlov, shot through with phantasmagorical flourishes - monochrome or blood-red filters and apparent hallucinations, to say nothing of the aforesaid creature, a skulking mass of tendrils that puts me in mind of the Shadow from Ursula K Le Guin's novel A Wizard Of Earthsea.

Wonder over the last couple of weeks (in addition to the hands-on I had as a part of our current cover story), and the review embargo has officially lifted. However, due to restrictive embargo guidelines that don't allow us to discuss large portions of the game, we have opted to hold our final review until the game is available for purchase. With that said, I did want to share some brief thoughts within the confines of the embargo.
I've loved my time with Super Mario Bros. Wonder. The game is aptly named for a title that instills a strong sense of wonder around every corner. Each stage introduces new gimmicks with appropriate and well-designed on-ramps, then expands on them in fun and unique ways. I truly never knew what I was getting into each …]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-10-18T11:52:03.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[More than two years after its initial reveal trailer, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is almost here. Due out October 20 exclusively on PlayStation 5, developer Insomniac Games' sequel to 2018's Marvel's Spider-Man and 2020's Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales is a game we thoroughly enjoyed – read Game Informer's Marvel's Spider-Man 2 review here – and we're excited for others to play it. Insomniac is too, but in a new statement, it tells players that while the game will be playable on physical discs in full, it recommends downloading the day one patch. 
More specifically, the download update is Version 1.001.002 and it will be available at launch this Friday. Digital owners don't need to worry about this as the patch will be installed as part of the pre-loaded version of Marvel's Spider-Man 2.

October 17, 2023
"The disc contains the entire game and is playable from start to finish with no patch or online requirement," Insomniac's statement reads. "But for the best experience, we highly encourage physical/disc-based players to download update Version 1.001.002 on launch day – prior to experiencing the opening mission of the game for the first time. Digital players – don't worry, if you pre-load the digital version of the game, you'll get 1.001.002 as your pre-loaded version." 
As for why, Insomniac says this update features polish to the gold master of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 available on disc. It improves the opening sections of the game and includes other general refinements to the Spidey experience. It also includes some additional accessibility options. 
Marvel's Spider-Man 2 hits PlayStation 5 on October 20.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Amnesia games are set decades apart, but they all begin in the same moment, a moment of waking that is also a moment of erasure and disconnection, a rebirth outside the flow of events from which to descend into the machine of history afresh. On 19th August 1839, a young man opens his eyes to find himself in a vast, silent castle in the forests of Prussia. He discovers a letter from his "past self", Daniel, who urges him to murder the castle's secluded owner, a baron named Alexander, and warns that he is being hunted by a monstrous Shadow. 60 years later on New Year's Eve, the celebrated meat factory owner Oswald Mandus starts awake in the opulent stillness of his manor house in London. Hearing the distant voices of his children, he goes to look for them in the "splendid architectures" below.
On 21st July 1916, at the height of World War I, the soldier Henri Clément stumbles from his sickbed in a colossal bunker beneath the Western Front. With nobody about, and no memory of events during his convalescence, he follows a trail of blood through the collapsing tunnels towards the pantry. And on an unknown day in March 1939, the engineering drafter Tasi Trianon wakes in the wreckage of a plane, deep in the Algerian desert, and enters the nearby caves in search of her husband Salim. Four games, four forgotten pasts, four new beginnings, one descent.
Beware: major spoilers for the entire Amnesia series below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If XCOM and Invisible, Inc. had a secret one-night stand in the back of a Cyberpunk 2077 taxi, the resulting lovechild would probably look a lot like Cyber Knights: Flashpoint. It's the next game from the Trese Brothers, the makers of Star Traders: Frontiers, and I've been playing its opening missions over the last couple of days. It's good, folks, and there's a lot to dig into with its release into early access this week. 
There's a sizable story campaign and a bunch of side missions already playable here, and its emphasis on stealth and escalating security levels whisked me right back to the good old days of 2015 when I first sat down to play Klei's stealthy masterpiece. There are still a couple of rough edges here and there, but if you've been looking for a strategy RPG with a harder-edge than, say, Mimimi's recently released Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew, or just something a bit sneakier than your run of XCOM-likes, Cyber Knights: Flashpoint is definitely worth keeping an augmented eye on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in the glorious Xbox One years, when every Microsoft executive was engaged in the act of putting one foot in their mouth while shooting it simultaneously, there was a giddy period of marketing conducted by means of Phil Spencer's T-shirts. He'd rock up on E3 stages like a cabaret dancer, touting tees with various new or elderly videogame licenses on them, and whipping older fans into a frenzy of speculation as to possible remakes or sequels. I myself had to go lie down after seeing Phil in a Phantom Dust shirt. Teaser-shirts, we should have called them. Look at him in the picture up there, showing off a chestful of Hexen. Shameless!


Sadly/happily, those halcyon days are behind us, but Phil still loves to dangle the carrot of an ancient IP now and then. Speaking on the Xbox podcast last night (while sporting a boring Halo championship jacket), he suggested that Microsoft could do more to revive their older franchises. Or at least "revisit" them in some fashion.

Sonic Superstars marks a step back to the Genesis-era 2D platforming that put the series on the map and a leap forward by letting three more friends join the adventure. While the former largely succeeds in providing an enjoyable nostalgic experience, the latter fails to allow partners to have the same amount of fun.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the release of Intel's somewhat underwhelming 14th-gen processors today, I feel a lot of people are going to be looking once more at AMD Ryzen 7000 systems. These CPUs offer the same access to DDR5 RAM and PCIe 5.0 components as Intel's latest offerings, yet typically consume less power while delivering better gaming performance at the high end. That makes it easier to build a balanced system, especially with deals on Ryzen 7000 CPUs and motherboards starting to become more commonplace. 
Case in point is this AWD-IT bundle deal on a Ryzen 5 7600X and an MSI MAG B650 Tomahawk WiFi motherboard for £400, versus £445 for the two items separately. That's a pretty fair deal!

But the biggest surprise? How familiar it felt. So, it might be a bit odd that MW3 is wholly unsurprising for being more COD and simultaneously, a surprise for being more COD. Really, I think it comes down to developer Sledgehammer's decision to mash some of COD's previous triumphs with some of its finest maps.
Despite COD extending its hand with a warm welcome back, I can't help but feel it's one trembled with nerves. MW3's beta suckered me in with its nostalgia hits but there's definitely an air of it being a stopgap as devs figure out where it should turn next.

It's terrible news for those affected, of course, but it also doesn't bode well for the future of independent music. Bandcamp, which has now traded hands twice in two years, is one of the few places where indie musicians can make a living. There are plenty of angry reactions from musicians and bands on social media, as you'd expect, but game developers are also rallying in support of Bandcamp United, with criticism aimed at Epic and Songtradr in equal measure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["I am most moved and always have been by stupid courage — the kind when, against all odds, the hero just keeps going," William Goldman once said. This is a thing Goldman I have in common. To help you tell us apart, a point of difference between Goldman and I is that he expressed his love of stupid courage by writing Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid, whereas I express mine by really liking Cyberpunk 2077.

Stupid courage is a trait that CD Projekt Red's first-person RPG seems to admire, but that's never more clear than in a new ending to the base game added by the Phantom Liberty expansion. It shows what happens when the heroes reject stupid courage and choose self-centred pragmatism instead. Spoilers for Cyberpunk 2077 and Phantom Liberty throughout.

More specifically, Season's Greetings hits Lake on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on November 15.

As you can see in the trailer above, Season's Greetings brings players to a snow-covered Providence Oaks during 1985's holiday season, set one year before the original story of Lake. In it, players control Thomas Weiss, an amiable mail carrier and father to Lake protagonist Me…]]></summary>

The gist, for those who missed out on the demo: you walk around small islands punching resources out of the landscape, building crafting stations and dwellings, and slowly amassing the means to access other islands. Or, you ignore all that, and treat the whole thing as an idle clicker, with no time limit and no real opportunity to fail.

This week, Sky and anti-piracy group FACT reported a similar operation using clear and unusually specific language. That's a welcome change; back in January, police forces all over the UK were instructed not to discuss visit numbers due to fears that the deterrent effect would be watered down.

Amongst other things, we can expect more robust search features, support for third-party subscriptions, better EGS launcher performance, a download manager with improved controls, and a new "for you" personalisation tab - all of that rolling out across 2024 and 2025.


Naturally, Epic will be continuing with their free games program through "2023 and beyond", and they've also put together a couple of special publishing offers for developers, Epic First Run and Now on Epic, which are designed to lure more studios from the amoeba-like embrace of Valve's gaming empire.

There was, of course, the Future Of Play booth that our Graham organised for the show (the contents of which you can see right here), but every year the Leftfield Collection houses a couple more custom controller games that are just as illustrative of all the amazing things going on in the world of interactive entertainment these days. 
Case in point, there were two games from this year's cohort that impressed me in equal measure over the weekend - and it was perhaps fitting that they were located directly opposite one another in the Leftfield Collection's long, white corridor. One was a mind-bogglingly complex, almost military-grade-looking briefcase stuffed full of switches, nozzles and buttons, and the other was an impossibly cute cardboard flip book and projector combo that let its cartoon hero Bib bound across the 3D paper environments to find a way home. Here's a little look at both of them in action.

The sooner, the better, based on what we’ve heard so far.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I love it when game names do what they say on the tin, but I love it even more when they contain hidden depths behind that initial simplicity. Hermit And Pig is indeed a game about a reclusive old hermit and his truffle-hunting pig, but this charming adventure RPG also has one of the most involving turn-based battle systems I've come across in a while. 
Taking place in first person a la Dragon Quest, Hermit must deal with all sorts of mad and angry wildlife as he hunts for his favourite forest mushrooms, and their scowling (and endearingly daft) expressions are just the tip of this excellent iceberg. For you're not just choosing from a list of moves and watching them play out onscreen. Oh no. Each attack also comes with its own three-button fighting combo, and you'll need to input the right one (often at the right time) to deal the most damage. It's a brilliant system, making Hermit And Pig easily one of this year's highlights from EGX's Leftfield Collection.

Wonder declared the series’ return to the 2D side-scrolling genre with a colorful bang. The game signals the return to Mario’s roots from a core gameplay perspective, but it’s more connected to Mario’s past than most people initially realized. While many remember the creative level design, expressive art style, and discovery of the game-changing Wonder Flowers, the most memorable moment came at the end of the announcement trailer, as everyone’s favorite plumber grabbed a never-before-seen item and transformed into an elephant. That moment told everyone that Super Mario Bros. Wonder, despite taking the series back to its 2D origins, is trying bold, new things unlike anything the franchise has seen before.

As a speed-focused arcade racer, Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged is a joy thanks to the emphasis on going fast, collecting Hot Wheels cars spanning decades, and crafting your own tracks. However, it doesn’t quite have the variety of tracks to keep it fresh throughout, and the story mode is an innocuous affair, leading to middle-of-the-pack results instead of the checkered flag it was chasing.
While it may not be as technical as most racing sims or as silly as the Mario Kart serie…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you played a videogame at all in 2022, I hope it was Roadwarden. A blend of RPG and visual novel from Polish developer Moral Anxiety, it cast you as lonesome wayfarer maintaining the paths and investigating the mysteries or grievances of a thinly populated wilderness setting. It's a game of immense feeling, craft and cleverness, inspired by table-top games, which puts hoarier ideas about videogame role-playing through the wringer. In the world of Roadwarden, there's no grinding for XP or mindless loot-crafting treadmill. Knowledge, empathy and insight are worth far more than material wealth or wielding the shiniest axe. Quests can hinge on something as minute as your ear for dialects or knowing the correct form of address. And each village along the trail is a world in itself.


Moral Anxiety's Windy Meadow - which actually dates back to before development of Roadwarden, but has been substantially remastered since the latter's release - essentially narrows the focus to one of those villages. Out today, it's a quietly gorgeous visual novel in which you follow several characters in different timeframes, building up a layered understanding of one and the same setting, with scene transitions plotted on a beautiful pixelart map screen.

The memos and emails in question are from now-defunct US gun company Remington Arms, which was once part of the conglomerate Freedom Group. They've been disclosed by a lawyer as part of legal proceedings launched by the parents of children killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre, in which 20-year-old Adam Lanza shot and killed 26 people using a Remington-made AR15 rifle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Silence Of The Siren is a name I'm perpetually going to get mixed up with fellow strategy games Songs Of Silence and Songs Of Conquest over the next couple of years, but there's certainly no mistaking what this sci-fi, tactics explorathon looks and plays like when you see it in the flesh. Made by the same team behind 2018's Project Hospital, Silence Of The Siren is an homage to Heroes Of Might And Magic where several different alien races are fighting to control a distant alien planet. It's a little bit 4X-y, but not massively so, and I had a very fun time indeed with its EGX demo over the weekend, which I think I played for almost a solid hour and completely forgot about the growing queue of folks behind me. Sorry about that…

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Analogue Pocket is a retro handheld marvel, capable of playing your favorite Game Boy and Game Boy Advance games on its beautiful screen with modern sensibilities and technology – simply put, it's the best way to play a Game Boy game, assuming you can get your hands on the always-sold-out device. Now, Analogue is targeting the Nintendo 64 catalog with its next device, the Analogue 3D. 
Analogue has shared an image of what appears to be the device, although the full look at it is obscured. You can view it at the top of the article, but it's below as well:
An image released alongside today's news teases what appears to be a sleek, black, and faithful recreation of the Nintendo 64 controller. You can check it out below: 
Analogue says the 3D device will feature 4K HDMI output, its proprietary Analogue OS, wireless Bluetooth, and 2.4G Wi-Fi. It will also have "4 original-style controller ports," presumably so that players can use their original Nintendo 64 controllers with the 3D. The company says the 3D's 4K output allowed "us to created incomprehensibly profound Original Display Modes," and that in collaboration with 8BitDo, it will release a wireless controller for the device. 
Analogue didn't share more, but the 3D is set to release some time in 2024. Preorders are not yet open, but if it's like the Pocket release, preorders will happen well before the actual release (and if you want one, plan on preordering because the Pockets sold out immediately). 

While waiting to learn more, read Game Informer's Analogue Pocket review.

Being the sequel to two excellent games is not a guarantee of success. But it does set strong expectations. Thankfully, Spider-Man 2 meets and exceeds those expectations, providing uniformly stellar superhero action characterized by blazing-fast combat, smart mission design, and regular injections of thrilling set-pieces. Behind all that excitement, it also houses a fervent and heartfelt commentary on second chances, rehabilitation, and redemption. As a result, even in its dark moments, Spider-Man 2 delivers a wholesome and optimistic adventure rooted in j…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nintendo revealed in August that longtime Mario voice actor Charles Martinet would no longer be voicing Mario. Amongst speculation of a different voice actor for Mario in Super Mario Bros. Wonder trailers, Nintendo also announced Martinet was not jumpman's voice in the game, leaving fans to wonder who the new voice is. After months of internet sleuthing, guesswork, and more, Nintendo has confirmed that Genshin Impact voice actor Kevin Afghani is the new voice of Mario. 
"The voice actor's name is Kevin Afghani," Nintendo tells Game Informer in a statement.
Afghani celebrated the news with a tweet today about how excited he is to voice both Mario and Luigi in Super Mario Bros. Wonder. 
Incredibly proud to have voiced Mario and Luigi in Super Mario Bros. Wonder. Thanks to Nintendo for inviting me into the Flower Kingdom!
October 13, 2023
Afghani's credits include Arnold in the aforementioned Genshin Impact, Raditz in Dragon Ball R&R, and Short Detective, General, and Grunt in the Secret History of Cuphead short.
Super Mario Bros. Wonder hits Switch exclusively on October 20. Ahead of its release, Mario graced the cover of the latest issue of Game Informer, and we've been diving deep into the making of the game and more in our exclusive Super Mario Bros. Wonder coverage hub. Here are some of the stories you can find in it:

However, perhaps the most shocking thing these two games have in common is when they release.
In the 1990s, Sonic the Hedgehog was the sole series able to briefly challenge Mario's claim to the platforming throne, and next week may prove the series' fates are forever intertwined.

After 2006's Mortal Kombat: Armageddon seemingly concluded the franchise's main narrative, 2011's entry picked up the bloody pieces. It moved the saga forward by resetting the timeline, serving as a soft reboot that brought Mortal Kombat back to its 2D fighting roots and ushering in the return of the classic roster. MK 9's cinematic story mode served as an epiphany for the series and fighting games as a whole, establishing the blueprint for narrative fighting campaigns still utilized today. MK9's story also serves as the first chapter of the modern trilogy of games that Mortal Kombat 1 builds upon. For a whole lot more on MK9 and its development, you can read this feature on how the reboot saved the franchise.
Join editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they battle their way through MK 9 to see how its reimagined tournament holds up.
