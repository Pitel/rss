As a self-proclaimed former horse girl, getting to ride horses in games is something that I always look forward to. Titles like Breath of the Wild, Red Dead Redemption, and The Witcher definitely scratch that itch, but sometimes, all I want to do is ride around without other mechanics getting in the way. While my childhood favorite, Barbie Horse Adventures: Wild Horse Rescue, is outdated at this point, there's a new game releasing soon that brings equestrian to the forefront of its mechanics: Aesir Interactive's Horse Tales – Emerald Valley Ranch.
The gameplay trailer highlights a bunch of different features that players might expect from a horse-centric game, other than riding around the open world of course, like training and breeding horses…]]></summary>

Happily though, there are also now a range of much more affordable keyboards that still include the unusual colour schemes, high-quality components and brilliant typing experiences that make mechanical keyboards so fascinating to me. One of the best makers in this space is Akko, and today a range of their best full-size and compact keyboards are on sale at Amazon UK.

I don't associate my PC or office space in general with "cozy vibes" — not now, and probably not ever. So it's wonderful to hear that Dorfromantik, a minimalistic village-building game that's out now on Steam, is coming to Nintendo Switch on September 29. In terms of low-stakes, just-let-me-unwind gaming, I can't think of a better platform.
This news got buried in yesterday's Gamescom deluge, but it's worth highlighting today.
https://twitter.com/_Toukana/status/1562216676057354240
Dorfromantik is a game about building out a landscape by placing down randomly-drawn tiles — trees, houses, railroads, rivers — which connect in aesthetically pleasing ways. You'll start small, piece by piece, but end up with a pleasant-looking land that streches far.
While it's possible to play aimlessly, if you're looking for more concrete goals, there are scores to chase, and achievements to work toward. There is a way to play strategically rather than just going with the flow. Zoey's got a good breakdown in her PC review.
Speaking of which, PC players will be getting controller support in an update, presumably around the same time as the Nintendo Switch release of Dorfromantik.
Surprisingly, Dorfromantik is the first game from Toukana Interactive. With the way things seem to be going, I'm hoping the developers can take this success and run with it. In the shorter term, maybe that means more ports, potentially PlayStation, Xbox, iOS, and Android. Further out, though, I'd love to see where these game design concepts can go.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Less Rumblin', More Squawkin'
Publisher 3goo has released a bewildering gameplay trailer for its upcoming re-release of obscure fighter The Rumble Fish 2. Currently in development for PC & consoles at its original studio Dimps, the 2D anime fighter is expected to arrive, (alongside its predecessor), at the tail-end of 2022.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-K_j6U_pCk
As you can see from the trailer, originally hosted by Japanese outlet 4gamer, The Rumble Fish 2 is hardly the most subtle of fighters, with bold, lurid visuals, over-the-top characters and movesets, and boasting a literal cacophony of vulgar, almost indistinct noise to soundtrack its hard-hitting action. Originally released to Japanese arcades in 2005, The Rumble Fish 2 would barely see light outside of its native Japan, which makes 3goo's incoming rereleases something of a special occasion for fighting game fans.
The two titles are set in a dystopian take on our own world, rendered asunder by corporate capitalism run amok. The series is typified by its goofy sense of humor, anarchic tone, and distinct "S.M.A." (Smooth Model Animation) visual style. In a post-Garou world, The Rumble Fish was the last hurrah for good-looking, technically proficient 2D fighting games, before developers would decide that 3D was the way forward for all of the major brawling-based IPs.
The Rumble Fish and The Rumble Fish 2 are currently in development for PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms. They are both expected to launch on all of the aforementioned platforms this winter.

This huge Splatoon 3 advertisement was spotted by Redditor, getHi9h (thanks, Go Nintendo), at Yongsan station in the South Korean capital, and we can't help but marvel at the size of it.

How to access Sumeru
If you're up to date on your Archon Quests (and many of you are, prepping for 3.0) and are done with the Chasm, just head to the waypoint in the southwest corner of the map, right near the Chasm. Head west and climb up the Chasm walls: you'll see Sumeru in all its glory at the apex (in the header image).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft’s chief executive officer of gaming and Xbox head Phil Spencer believes games exclusive to a single console will become something we see less of over time. 
This news comes from a new interview with Spencer from Bloomberg discussing Microsoft’s in-the-process acquisition of Activision Blizzard, the landscape of console exclusivity, and more. He believes that this is a good thing for the gaming industry in the long run. 
“[It] is something we’re just going to see less and less of,” when discussing the idea of specific games being exclusive to a single device. “Maybe you happen in your household to buy an Xbox, and I buy a PlayStation, and our kids want to play together, and they can’t because we bought the wrong piece of plastic to plug into our television.
“We really love being able to bring more players in reducing friction, making people feel safe, secure when they’re playing, allowing them to play with their friends, regardless of what device – I think in the long run that is good for this industry. And maybe in the short run, there’s some people in some companies that don’t love it. But I think as we get over the hump and see where this industry can continue to grow, it proves out to be true.”
Bloomberg also asked Spencer about the status of Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard acquisition, how the company will handle unions and ongoing unionization efforts happening within Activision Blizzard, and more, so be sure to check out the publication’s full story here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Suikoden successor will have more to share soon
While we already got a little bit of Eiyuden Chronicle earlier this year with the prequel game Rising, there are still the Hundred Heroes on the horizon. Rabbit & Bear Studios put out a new Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes trailer today, as part of Gamescom, and the RPG still looks fantastic.
Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes is the Kickstarter-backed successor to the Suikoden series, from members of the original Suikoden team. While we've seen some small slices of gameplay, we get a bit more in today's trailer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdnPIkvUigw
It's impressive how this does manage to look HD-2D, but still has a distinct style of it. The world of Hundred Heroes looks gorgeous, and I'm particularly keen on the battle animations. The camera pans and zooms are great, and I love seeing the big party lineup all on one screen.
An untold future
While we still haven't glimpsed any footage that contains straight-up fights with a UI and everything, hopefully we'll get some more soon. At the end of today's trailer, Rabbit & Bear confirms that more news is scheduled for Tokyo Game Show. TGS 2022 runs from September 15 through 18, just a few weeks from now.

The prequel action RPG Eiyuden Chronicle: Rising already left a good impression on those who played it. You can even spot a party member from Rising, a certain sword-wielding kangaroo, in the battle at one point. And a shark fighter too? Looks like we'll get some wild characters to recruit into our massive party.
Everything we've seen so far of Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes looks quite promising. Here's hoping the studio can deliver. Last time we heard about an estimated launch, the RPG was pushed into 2023. We'll see if we get a firm launch, or maybe even some more game info, at Tokyo Game Show in September.

After its announcement last year, we have been eagerly awaiting updates on Purple Lamp Studio's SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake. While we are still without any sign of a release date (guess the mail must be slow out of Bikini Bottom), we have now received the first look at some gameplay footage.
Showcased at Gamescom today, the level that we see being played is set in the Wild West Jellyfish Fields — one of the seven worlds that you will be able to explore in the game. (Thanks to Nintendo Everything for sharing the footage.) And, much like the very enjoyable SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle For Bikini Bottom Rehydrated — which we gave a 7/10 in our review — this 3D platformer puts SpongeBob on a McGuffin hunt around a Wild West setting, tapping cacti and dispatching troublesome jellyfish.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pentiment, Obsidian Entertainment's medieval narrative adventure title, is coming on November 15. We first learned of the project during the Xbox Games Showcase in June. 
The game's art direction emulates medieval manuscript illustrations and woodcut prints while the story unfolds in 16th-century Bavaria. You play as an illustrator who becomes wrapped up in a series of murders over 25 years. You'll engage in choice-driven conversations where your decisions steer the plot and create lasting consequences in a tale that expands into a larger conspiracy. Check out the original reveal trailer below to see it in action. 


Pentiment is made by a small team within Obsidian led by director Josh Sawyer. You can pick it up on Xbox consoles and PC (day one on Game Pass). It will be the second game that Obsidian ships this year, following the 1.0 release of Grounded in September.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The latter will have "world-first gameplay"
Another week, another lack of a big Nintendo Direct proper stream — but Nintendo is keeping the train rolling with a Treehouse Live segment, which will air on August 26 at 12:30PM ET. Let's take a look at what the Nintendo Splatoon 3 Harvestella stream entails.
Splatoon 3 stream
This is going to be the main event, and will actually feature two different Splatoon 3 segments. The first is a "deep-drive into the all new single-player mode," which will hopefully give us a good look at some of the level designs for the campaign. While multiplayer is typically the focus for Splatoon games, there's a lot of potential with campaigns, and I'm anxious to see if this levels-up things at all.
The next part of the Splatoon 3 stream is "stages and strategies for the Splatfest World Premiere demo." This one is more self-explanatory, and will of course deal with multiplayer mechanics for the Splatfest demo set to debut on August 27.
Harvestella stream
Finally, and it's vague at the moment, but we're getting a "world-first gameplay" stream for Harvestella. People seem really stoked on this one, and although splitting streams between different games is always a gamble, I'm willing to bet a lot of people will tune in (either during or afterward with the VOD) for a look at this one.
When the stream airs, you'll be able to find it here.

We now know that Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes, the turn-based Suikoden successor from series creator Yoshitaka Murayama, is coming to Switch thanks to a Kickstarter update back in May. But we haven't seen much of the game for a while except through continued monthly development updates — and in part because a prequel, Eiyuden Chronicle: Rising, launched earlier in the year.
But publisher 505 Games has brought the game to this year's Gamescom, and it's shown off a bit more of the game, from the cutscenes to the visuals. (Thanks Gematsu!)

When you first see Pentiment, it's quite plainly different from most other games. It's a historical thriller, an adventure told in another era using art, sounds, and design conducive to the overall feeling of life in 16th century upper Bavaria.
It's no surprise, then, that this is a passion project for the developers at Obsidian putting it together. We got a chance to take a look at some of Pentiment ahead of Gamescom and participate in a Q&A with some developers behind the project. And it didn't take long for Pentiment to seize my attention.

Modern homages to classic video games often go one of two ways: They either stick close to the gameplay conventions to which they are paying tribute, or they expand the original games’ styles in meaningful and innovative ways. Blossom Tales II: The Minotaur Prince, like its 2017 predecessor, is more the former than the latter, adhering closely to the classic Legend of Zelda blueprint, most notably that of A Link to the Past. Despite this lack of innovation, Blossom Tales II still manages to capture many of the acclaimed elements of what many consider to be one of the greatest video …]]></summary>

Cybersecurity company Irdeto has revealed some brand new tech to help protect Switch games from piracy. Denuvo — a somewhat controversial DRM technology first used on FIFA 15 back in 2014 — aims to integrate effortlessly into the developer's build toolchain without impacting the game itself as well as inserting checks into the code to block playing the game on emulators.
As you'd expect, news of this 'Nintendo Switch Emulator Protection' tech hasn't gone down particularly well online. Denuvo is already controversial with PC gamers as many have claimed it affects performance, from frame rate drops to longer load times — claims which the makers dispute. So when a game comes out on Steam with Denuvo (anti-piracy) included, players often make their feelings known. Sometimes, developers have gone back and removed the DRM software from their games post-release (as was the case with the Steam version of Rage 2).

Developer Slightly Mad Studios has announced that its 2015 prestige racing simulator Project CARS, along with its 2017 sequel, Project CARS 2, are to be delisted from sale on all formats this fall. Both titles will then be rendered unpurchasable, though owners will still be able to redownload and play the games as they wish.
Speaking in a brief statement on Twitter, Slightly Mad Studios pointed to the expiration of various in-game licenses as the reason for the games' removal from sale. Certain vehicles, tracks, and other trademarks in both Project CARS releases are clearly reaching their end-of-terms, with publisher Codemasters not looking to renew the licenses for further years.

"We will remove Project CARS from sale on October 3rd and Project CARS 2 on September 21st," wrote the studio. "We remain focused on making the best racing sim titles, and, as mentioned previously, we look forward to sharing more on the next Slightly Mad project when the time is right."
There is no mention of Project CARS 3 befalling the same fate, so no doubt the 2020 sequel is currently still well within its licensing rights, though it will no doubt be similarly delisted once its time is also up. In the meantime, Project CARS, Project CARS 2, and Project CARS 3 are all available now on PS4, PC, and Xbox One.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A tale of the small but mighty.
Kyle Thompson, the creator of Sheepo, is back with another weird yet wonderful addition to the Metroidvania genre. Islets is a gorgeously hand-painted story of connection and adventure through a world quite literally torn apart. Taking on the role of a self-doubting mouse whose dream is to reconnect to the world and return life to normal, this enchanting title will have you scouring every nook and cranny of its incredibly expansive map.
The story of Islets follows Iko, one of the one hundred adventurers whose goal is to reconnect the islands. However, the inhabitants of Sky City are quick to share their disappointment with how many actually return. Iko has a charming and hopeful attitude despite saying nothing for most of the story; instead, our hero speaks only through written letters with fellow adventurers, or directly to Mika, who patiently waits for him to return home.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It ended at the World Championships this past weekend
Pokken Tournament competitive play is no more, at least as far as Nintendo/The Pokemon Company is concerned. Despite rolling out in 2017, Pokken Tournament DX has been rolling along in the competitive scene even in an official capacity, but this is the end — unless a sequel comes out eventually.
How do we know that for sure? Well, an official Pokemon Twitter account confirmed it back in May, before the World Championships took place, stating:
"When the 2022 Season concludes, #PokkenTournamentDX will no longer be part of the #PlayPokemon program. We acknowledge this game’s incredible community & its unwavering support. Thank you for creating great moments and memories with us throughout the years. Pokken is powerful!"

Fast-forward to this past weekend, and that same account put out a farewell video for the Pokken Tournament community:
https://twitter.com/playpokemon/status/1560702134873739265
I can see why this happened, but it also bums me out a bit. Pokken Tournament DX should probably be bigger than it was, and when I visited Japan years back when the original Pokken was out; it seemed to have a pretty passionate scene. There's a lot of folks who dig this series, and would love to see it live on: plus, it helps bring some much-needed variety to the fighting game scene!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Park Beyond, an upcoming theme park management sim in the vein of a juiced up Rollercoaster Tycoon, is trying to balance two slightly opposed teams in its target audience. There are people who love doing the management bits - the bean-counting, optimising the amount of salt on fries to make people thirsty and buy more drinks, paying close attention to demographics and average spends and that sort of kidney*. Then there are people who want to design a park full of cool-ass rides and different themed zones, a true magical wonderland. Inside this Park Beyond are two wolves, in other words, and each needs a different but equally robust set of tools to wrangle.
After some hands on with an early build of Park Beyond, I have a little more faith that Limbic Entertainment are going to be able to pull it off. The toolset for building a rollercoast is, in particular, impressive. It's never been so easy to make a ride that breaks both the laws of physics and the laws of health and saftey. The coasters in this game are an absolute menace. In a good way.

Setting up shop at Gamescom this week, the studio has announced that the Agnetha, Björn, Benny and Anni-Frid classics will be making their voyage to Switch on October 4th.
But it seems like even more information has been slipping through the studio's fingers today as they have also announced which of the band's smash hits will be coming to the game. The expected stone-cold classics such as 'Dancing Queen', 'Mamma Mia' and 'SOS' are of course on the tracklist, but the game will also pay respects to the latest album, with 'I Still Have Faith In You' representing fans of the group's current weird Tron phase.

When the Splatoon 3-focused Nintendo Direct hit two weeks ago, I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of the information and how much content the Splatoon team was bringing at launch. As someone who very much enjoyed the first two Splatoon games (as well as Splatoon 2's Octo Expansion), that Nintendo Direct was all I needed to bring my excitement levels up a few notches. However, having the opportunity to get my hands on the soon-to-be-released Splatoon 3 only skyrocketed this game up the list of my most anticipated 2022 releases.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Morty Smith from the popular cartoon Rick & Morty is now a playable character in the free-to-play stage fighter, MultiVersus. 
This news comes from a new Morty-focused trailer for MultiVersus that showcases the fighter in action. It features a look at how he plays as a Bruiser class brawler, complete with a muscle-enhanced left arm "Armothy" and the "Plumbus" all-purpose alien device.
Check these moves out and more in the trailer below:


"Morty, the teenage grandson of a mega-genius scientist Rick Sanchez, arrives as part of MultiVersus Season 1 and is a Bruiser class character with more than a few tricks up his sleeve," a press release reads. "Morty's moveset, which is on display in a newly released gameplay trailer, features a mix of skills and attacks, from his muscle-enhanced left arm 'Armothy' and 'Plumbus' all-purpose alien device, to his ability to whip himself at opponents and use of various projectiles."
The trailer also reveals the President Morty character variant, which is available as an in-game purchase right now.
For more, check out every character nerf and buff from the big MultiVersus Season 1 update, and then read about how Black Adam and Stripe from Gremlins are coming to the game this season at some point. Check out our thoughts on the game in the Game Informer MultiVersus review after that, and then read about how MultiVersus was July's best-selling game in the U.S. thanks to its Founder's Pack.

Donut blocks. We all know them, and we all either love them or hate them as they collapse under the weight of our platforming plumber Mario. These platforms have been around since Super Mario Bros. 3, always waiting to lure us in with the safety of a flat surface, before falling and taking us Mario to his demise. Presumably, because they're donuts, right? Wrong.
Leave it to Supper Mario Broth to uncover the truth behind these devious dough-shaped platforms. It turns out that, despite looking like donuts in the 2D Mario games, that's not actually what they're based on. We've all seen these platforms utilised in New Super Mario Bros., Super Mario 3D World, and a few other 3D games, and they're not just little floating donuts, but rather a tube.

Thankfully, Tinykin takes a more whimsical approach to this hellish situation. It’s a sci-fi adventure platformer where you and a tiny alien army explore a giant house and, as a bite-size summary, it’s excellent. Splashteam have made a fun, laid-back Pikmin-like bursting with humorous surprises and I played the game with a silly grin on my face the entire time.

MultiVersus has welcomed its first-ever post-launch character: Morty Smith — star of the sweary Adult Swim show Rick & Morty — is now available to purchase in the free-to-play crossover fighter.
The grandson of mad scientist Rick, Morty has found himself thrust throughout time and space, again and again, facing down perilous situations and entertaining your loud friend Mike at the office. With access to almost infinite regions of dimension, Morty's weak teenage frame will be emboldened in battle thanks to a wide variety of reality-shifting attacks and specials, which may or may not reflect the hilarious events of the long-running animated series. Because I'm guessing, to be perfectly honest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCMLGvlOxt0
A Bruiser class character, Morty is a button-slapping brawler, joining the MultiVersus roster of heavy-hitters including Garnet, Batman, Shaggy, and Taz. Morty's evolved appendage "Armothy" can be used to knock his opponents seven ways from Sunday in standard attacks, while his trademark all-purpose alien device, Plumbus, is utilized in specials. For long-distance warfare, Morty has access to snake-based projectiles, as well as a Passive which allows him to throw grenades at his enemies or plant them around the battleground for proximity damage. Just like in that famous episode maybe I don't know I'm 41.
Morty Smith is available to purchase in-game now, priced at 3,000 Gold, 700 Gleamium, or 1 Character Ticket. Morty will be followed later in season one by additional DLC characters. These will include Morty's grandfather Rick Sanchez, DC Comics' anti-hero Black Adam, and Gremlins' malevolent Stripe.
MultiVersus is available in open beta on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

Update : PQube Games has provided us with the following statement responding to Toge Productions' Twitter post:

“We have honoured all obligations of our publishing agreement and have supported Toge Productions at every stage of product development throughout their delays and difficulties. This support has included offering significant further funding, over and above grant funding, to support development, porting and marketing. Toge Productions have sought for some time to unilaterally enforce unreasonable revised terms to our agreement and it is disappointing that, as a result of not achieving that and despite PQube's significant efforts to accommodate this, they have sought to deal with the matter in this way. We will respond through the appropriate channels".

Necessary as it might have been for Bungie, this 'sunsetting' removing content people bought has raised hackles.

Expansions will stick around forever, though seasonal content will still leave at the end of each expansion cycle—and Bungie don't say anything about bringing back all the old stuff.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Elsewhere, the classics return.
Last week's UK charts saw the meteoric rise of Two Point Campus on Switch, with the Nintendo console accounting for a huge percentage of the game's sales. While Sega's university sim has fallen out of the top ten this week (down to number 14, in fact), the Switch has remained the title's dominant home, with the current sales breakdown sitting as follows:

Nintendo Switch - 68%
PlayStation 5 - 14%
PlayStation 4 - 14%
Xbox Series X/S - 4%

Of course, these figures only represent physical, boxed copies of the game and they may be slightly skewed by digital downloads. However, Nintendo's dominance in this field is nonetheless an impressive feat — especially as it doesn't include digital sales in its figures.

That essence has made its way into Blossom Tales II, a charming light adventure game in the classic "going on an adventure" sense rather than the "rubbing every item on every other item until you're allowed to play again" genre sense.
You're playing out a story playfully told by your grandfather, who's cast you as the wee hero of a village out to rescue your brother from the sinister Minotaur King. Both of you occasionally interject, sometimes prompting a decision that changes the game a little as your granddad amends things to your liking. It doesn't go to the full meta-narrative lengths of a Juarez Gunslinger with it, but it's a cute touch and keeps the framing relevant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's not often that we get to report a game coming out earlier than planned rather than delaying the date, so it's nice to be able to tell you that Gotham Knights has moved its release date up. It's only by four days, though, to October 21st, which is sort of baffling. Maybe Warner Bros. are about to announce a new DC-verse TV show coming out on the Knights' original release date of the 25th? Who knows. But along with this early-release sneak attack is a new trailer, giving us a closer look at the rogues gallery that the extended Bat-family are up against.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Grim Souls-like Lies Of P will be hitting PC sometime in 2023 according to a new gameplay trailer shown at Opening Night Live during this year's Gamescom. The RPG combines the story of Pinocchio with some major Bloodborne energy, as the puppet searches for a way to become a real human boy in a decimated city. This is far from the classic fairytale story though. With a dark-gothic backdrop and mechanical killer robots to contend with, Pinocchio has his work cut out for him. You can watch the new bombastic gameplay trailer below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Portable monitors are pretty awesome - they're an easy way to get a dual screen setup going on a laptop, and also work well to expand the Steam Deck's rather modest screen into something a little more co-op friendly. Of course, they also work for desktop computers too - and are much more portable and space-saving than an average actual desktop monitor. 
You can even get OLED models now - and a coupon code on Amazon US brings one model down from Innocn from $350 to $200 when you tick the 'coupon' box on the product page. That's quite a bargain for a 15.6-in portable screen of this calibre.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A fantasy open-world action game with some sleek combat
If you dig open-world action with a fantasy flair, Where Winds Meet might be one to watch. Developer Everstone Games unveiled its new action game Where Winds Meet today, and it's got some style.
Details are scarce so far about it, though we did get some look at the gameplay of Where Winds Meet today during Gamescom Opening Night Live 2022. It's a third-person action game, with some gorgeous views and big open areas.
At first glance, it gives off the third-person action vibes of a modern Assassin's Creed or Ghost of Tsushima. There are bows, swords, counters and follow-ups.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcHVTPbJVrM
Where Winds Meet is definitely taking a heavy dose of wuxia inspiration though. The way the protagonist leaps around in the air, or runs up the side of a ship, is pretty sick.
According to IGN, Where Winds Meet is set during the Ten Kingdoms era. Different factions are vying for power, which seems like good fodder for tough choices and also plenty of battles.
More than just a warrior
Developer Everstone Games also told IGN that the player can opt to take sides in the war, or choose to pursue other goals. You can look to be a doctor, merchant, or even just a wandering swordsman.
Different fighting styles will also be incorporated, to add a little variety to fights.

We only got a small bite today, but I'm impressed by what I've seen so far of Where Winds Meet. A little more fantasy action in the third-person open-world action genre could be pretty interesting. No firm date or window has been set yet, but I'm looking forward to hopefully seeing more from this project and team in the future.
Catch up on the rest of the Gamescom Opening Night Live announcements in our catch-all thread here.

It's a new fantasy action RPG, with super powers, set in a semi-open world. In what is becoming something of a theme for me tonight, however, the trailer doesn't really give much away about the game aside from the topline selling points. There is a tiny, teeny smattering of gameplay at the end, though. Big swords, big monsters, big magic, big sand. In another continuing theme from games revealed tonight, Atlas Fallen is out next year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Live or die, make your choice
It's been a long time since we've heard about The Outlast Trials, but Red Barrels brought a grisly new trailer to Gamescom Opening Night Live. The developers also announced a closed beta test for The Outlast Trials running from October 28 through November 1. As host Geoff Keighley put it, "That's right, some people will get to play something this year."
If you're generally on board with Outlast (or would be down for a Saw-puzzle-trap-filled take on the series with optional multiplayer antics), you'll want to keep tabs.
https://youtu.be/EVi3-VjbM1U
The Cold War-era premise is that Murkoff Corporation is testing new "methods of brainwashing and mind control." Rest assured, they'll be taking things to their most unhinged extreme. Today's trailer was all gore and grime. I need a shower!
Viewed in slow-mo, I liked the look of traps and gadgets that players can use to turn the tide during these so-called experiments. How the format works alone and with partners, and what happens when some of you perish, remains to be seen. I get the impression that Red Barrels got out of its comfort zone, and that could lead to a fresh new type of survival-horror experience, or potential alienation. I've always wanted a gnarly Saw-like game experience, and being able to share that with like-minded horror fans sounds novel.
More details on the Outlast Trials beta will be announced soon, so for now, just pencil in the October 28 start date, if anything. I'll certainly be in the right mood for this game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this week, the Dead Island 2: Day One Edition leaked on Amazon, showing a Lenny Kravitz-like warrior on the box cover. So, it’s only fitting that Gamescom 2022 ended with two trailers (cinematic and gameplay) for the long-overdue zombie-slaying sequel. 


We follow a chiseled survivor named Jacob as he leaves the safety of his (bloodied) condo and ventures into a Californian hellscape swarming with undead. He kills several adversaries with an empty rifle, jutting it through their rotten bodies and smashing their heads against the pavement with its wooden butt. 
The gameplay trailer shows scenic beaches, forsaken suburbs, cratered city streets, and still-lit carnivals. In what is one of the most graphic clips I’ve ever seen at a game show, we watch as the player-character clobbers zombies with blunt objects, jump-kicks adversaries off roofs (parkour mechanics?), and shoots gasoline tanks to engulf hordes in flames.


Dead Island 2 is a first-person action RPG with six playable characters. And according to a designer who appeared onstage, the gory romp has an irreverent, pulpy tone and gameplay that’s all about “experimenting with your preferred zombie-slaying methods.”

As Geoff continues to add more shows and reveal events under his belt, things are starting to look a little thinner. Although Gamescom Opening Night Live has the potential to give off the air of "the E3 of Europe," today was largely reserved for games that were already shown off in some capacity; or came back with a marketing reboot after years-earlier reveals. It's time for a Gamescom 2022 recap.
There was some cool stuff in there. The studio behind Moonbreaker smartly united with kinda-huge-deal author Brandon Sanderson to bring us a "Hearthstone meets XCOM" game; with a vibrant art style and a customizable mini painting element. No one expected a Killer Klowns from Outer Space adaptation — talk about a passion project! As far as big studio news goes, Son…]]></summary>

A long-in-development zombie game is back in action, and arriving early next year. Dead Island 2 will launch on February 3, 2023.
During today's Gamescom Opening Night Live 2022, Deep Silver and Dambuster Studios revealed a cinematic trailer for Dead Island 2. It features plenty of zombie-slaying action, and one of the game's playable characters, Jacob.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dv1cqr1npA
We also got a look at some gameplay for Dead Island 2, which features a ton of the bloody first-person action seen in the first Dead Island.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEkkrJpI6XA
Players will be able to play as one of six different characters including Jacob. Each one has their own style and skills, and you can instantly re-spec if you don't like the build you're putting together.
The story takes place in Los Angeles, with locations around the city including Beverly Hills and Venice Beach.
You can play the adventure by yourself, or opt to do some co-op. Up to three players can party up and blast through hordes of zombies together.

Rise from the grave
Dead Island 2 has been kicking around in some form or another for quite a while. We got some indication earlier this year that a Dead Island 2 launch could be set for 2023, and it looks like that's panned out.
While the news did leak a little bit ahead of schedule, it looks like the zombie-crushing, weapon-crafting action of Dead Island is due back soon. The original was a goofy, decent enough zombie-smasher with some light RPG elements and good co-op fun. While the successor to the series has been mired in development for quite a few years, we'll at least finally get a chance to see what a new Dead Island looks like soon.
Dead Island 2 will launch for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and Stadia on February 3, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A product description for The Outlast Trials says players can expect "mind-numbing terror," and that's exactly what we see in the game's newest trailer. Plenty of blood is shed as humans are used as lab rats in Murkoff Corporation's Saw-like tests. In some cases, the tests just look like torture and flatout murder.
The game looks overly graphic, yet also brings about comparisons to BioShock's tone and storytelling conventions. It'll be interesting to see how the narrative sews all of these wild experiements together. The Outlast Trials is designed as both a single-player and cooperative experience. The player clearly is free to explore at certain points, and appears to rely on trap-like devices to fight back and escape. In one sequence, we see two players helping each other up to higher ground.
The footage concludes with news of a short closed beta running from October 28 to November 1. No other release date news was shared.]]></summary>

As part of the Gamescom Opening Night Live presentation, publisher Nexon and developer Embark showed a blink-and-you'll-miss-it trailer for their upcoming game show shooter, The Finals.
The trailer offers very little in the way of context, but seemingly The Finals will focus on an ultra-violent "game" of survival, with players competing in a do-or-die competition to win big bucks and other prizes. Previously released footage featured rat-a-tat gunplay and bombastic explosive-based combat, with some vehicular mayhem and roof-jumping verticality thrown into the mix.
https://youtu.be/Gq-R9GjW-Ik
The concept would suggest we might be looking at a battle royale affair, perhaps with highly customizable player characters, but we'll have to wait a little longer for Embark Studios to play its hand and offer us a little more info on The Finals and its Smash T.V.-style landscape of killing for kash.
Embark Studios also talked up the game's sense of destruction.
"A skilled contender might go in guns blazing, but with environmental destruction in your arsenal, that’s just the start of what you can wield against your foes! All of our arenas can be altered, used, or reduced to rubble — and not just by you."
The Finals is currently in development for PC. Steam playtests are scheduled to begin "soon." Interested players can request access to join on Steam.

Sometimes, you want a game like Xenoblade Chronicles 3 or Elden Ring: One that eats up all your free time, requires careful attention, and takes hundreds of hours to properly understand. Sometimes, you want a game that you can half-pay attention to while you watch Better Call Saul and eat an entire bag of cheese-covered snack items.
Dorfromantik is the latter, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. It's a chill, zen, low-stress puzzle game that's all about building a landscape according to gentle rules, and it doesn't hurt that it's lovely to look at. If you enjoyed the satisfying building-plopping Islanders, or the charmingly pointless-but-fun Townscaper, then Dorfromantik will scratch that same brain-itch.

Hideo Kojima is one of the most prolific game developers of all time, and now he's launching his very own podcast to share his expertise with the world. During the Gamescom stream, Geoff brought in his "very good friend" Kojima, who said that while he's known for the games he makes, he was "here today to share some other news," that his "podcast program will be available exclusively on Spotify." Kojima will have various guests on the podcast from across various disciplines in the industry, so it looks like we're going to get a pretty in-depth look at the work of a wide variety of developers.

The podcast will be available with both Japanese and English audio, with simultaneous translation. Geoff Keighley will also be involved with a segment to give players up-to-date industry news. The first episode of the podcast will be available in only a few weeks, dropping officially on September 8. The podcast is officially titled Brain Structure, which seems pretty fitting for Kojima and his brand. Kojima is still working on games, by the way — it seems that this is just a side project.
So many gamers admire Kojima and all of the work he's done, so I'm betting this is going to be a huge success for Spotify. I know I'll be interested in hearing more and seeing what the feel of the podcast is — game development podcasts and be a ton of fun, if you're interested in that kind of thing.

Earlier this year, much like most of the things shown off at the Gamescom Opening Night Live stream today, we found out about Blacktail. But now, we got to see a little more of it in action.
Based on the premise alone, I'm waiting in the wings:
"A surreal first-person action adventure game, where the story of Baba Yaga comes to life. Explore an original take on Slavic folklore and forge your own legend. Become either the guardian of the woods, or the terror nightmares are made of."

Yeah, that sounds unique for sure!

It wouldn't be Gamescom Opening Night Live without a handful of vague teasers to set the mood and put out the feelers for newly-established studios looking to staff up. With that in mind, here's the briefest of looks at Wyrdsong, an open-world preternatural RPG from Something Wicked Games, a team founded by Bethesda's Jeff Gardiner.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5s48vY3Du8
Cool audio design, a sinister historical backdrop, and... not much else.
"Wyrdsong is an occult historical fantasy RPG set in a fictionalized Portugal in the middle ages," according to the studio. (Ooh, they used the "O" word!) "Players will be challenged to question both their reality and the choices they make as Wyrdsong is set to expand, question, and re-define aspects of what makes up the current Role Playing Game genre."
The Wyrdsong teaser trailer led with the team's prior experience, which included games like Fallout 3 and New Vegas, Skyrim, Dragon Age Inquisition, and The Outer Worlds.
From what we've seen today, there isn't much to show yet, so we'll have to put a pin in it. I fully expect this game to show up again at a future showcase. As intriguing as the occult-infused fantasy world could be, it's just a blip on my radar until we start to see it up close.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From the newly-created Ironbird Studios
Today during the Gamescom Opening Night Live ceremony, Polish publisher All in Games (who you might recognize as a publisher for Ghostrunner) announced a new internal development studio: Ironbird Creations. Curiously, it was created with the intention of "creating high-quality new action IPs," and there's one coming our way already in Phantom Hellcat.
Described as being "inspired by the NieR series," this action romp stars Jolene, a woman who breaks the seal of a cursed theater, then is tasked with saving it. Environmental mechanics are seemingly a bit part of the game, as you can destroy walls or slam people into the band pit. Jolene will also power up via theatrical masks, and there's going to be a mix of 3D and 2D perspectives to shift up the mechanics a bit.
Phantom Hellcat's setting is probably the most intriguing bit. A castle filled with vampires, and "plays inspired by pop culture" sound really promising, especially in a Suda 51 type of way. While action games need a lot of love and care to really sing, I have my eye on this one. No date was given, but you can wishlist it on Steam, and it's also set for release on PS4/PS5, and Xbox One/Xbox Series X platforms.

As XO Camina Drummer keeps tabs on her mutinous crew, she'll also be tasked to navigate the ruins of a downed vessel on the outskirts of an asteroid belt.
The trailer showed Drummer space walking, dodging debris, and working her way through the massive vessel. We also see her throw a punch and grapple with someone in zero gravity. To bring this beloved science-fiction universe to life, Telltale enlisted the development talents of Deck Nine (best known for the Life is Strange series). The first pre-alpha footage looks ambitious and dark, delivering a cinematic viewpoint into an investigation riddled with death. The facial animations on the characters also look like an evolution from Telltale's previous work, yet some of the same facial features look similar.

I've not yet seen anything I didn't like of Return To Monkey Island. It's a new instalment in the classic point 'n' click 'n' pirate series being made under the loving care of Ron Gilbert and Dave Grossman, two of the original devs, and now we know there's only a few more weeks to wait. Return To Monkey Island is coming soon to a computer near you on September 19th. There's a new trailer to prove it.

Warner Bros. Montreal released a brand new trailer for its upcoming comic adaptation Gotham Knights. Spotlit during Gamescom Opening Night Live, the trailer contained a new release date of October 21, pulling the DC Comics' title forward a few days from its earlier announced October 25. Make sure to pass the word along to your co-op buddy.
The cinematic trailer featured Batgirl, Red Hood, Robin, and Nightwing as they attempt to protect the city from a who's who of its sickest villains, including the tragic and brilliant Mr. Freeze, the thesp-like monstrosity Clayface, and the mistress of mayhem herself, Harley Quinn. We also saw more from the aristocratic but highly dangerous Court of Owls, and possibly an appearance from (a much svelter-looking) Professor Pyg.

As part of the Gamescom Opening Night Live festivities, WB Games also highlighted Harley Quinn and Mr. Freeze with a new pair of Gotham Knights screenshots.

The trailer starts with a comical cinematic sequence – a teenage boy listens to loud music and plays the air guitar in his bedroom while the once-peaceful neighborhood beyond his window gets vaporized. When he notices the explosions and opens the front door, Killer Klowns with blasters reveal themselves from behind a stack of boxed pizza pies. 
Killer Klowns From Outer Space: The Game is “a crazy new take on multiplayer horror” from the executive director of Friday The 13th: The Game. Brief gameplay clips were shown, with Killer Klowns firing lasers at fleeing civilians in a carnival playspace. A band of teens plan a retaliatory attack from a nearby tower, and chaos ensues.
Killer Klowns From Outer Space: The Game launches on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC in early 2023.]]></summary>

Scars Above is out and about for keeps now thanks to a Gamescom Opening Night Live reveal, and I'm still not sold, but I am on deck for it!
This is from Prime Matter, Koch Media's "premium gaming label," where Payday 3 and others lie, so there's some inherent promise there that it'll be given the budget it needs. At a glance, it looks like it's a story about awakening something humanity shouldn't have.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JpDzYLpYaE
Mad Head Games describes it as a "challenging" third-person action-adventure game on an alien planet. The protagonist, an astronaut named Kate, will have to use "ranged weapons, devices, consumables, and melee attacks to survive." The developers also mentioned elemental attacks, managing stamina for dodges, and crafting "different items and gadgets to aid you against the countless threats in this exoplanet."
"Kate is a scientist to her core, and you'll use that scientific expertise to extract information from your surroundings by scanning artifacts, materials, and creatures in order to learn about their features, properties, and weaknesses," according to the Serbia-based studio. "As you explore your surroundings, you will conduct analysis and gain knowledge that will allow you to craft new gadgets, weapons, and unlock abilities in Xenobiology and Engineering trees."
Scars Above is coming to PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X in early 2023. Did you remember it was shown off in 2021? Me neither!

We've seen plenty of games adapted to movies recently, but movies adapted to games have been a less common occurrence. As we learned today from the Gamescom stream, we're getting a Killer Klowns from Outer Space multiplayer horror game based on the horror/comedy film from 1988. The movie has had a cult following basically since it came out, and it has traumatized us with creepy clowns for decades.
The Killer Klowns game also has the executive director from the Friday the 13th game attached, so it appears that the horror genre makes for some of the best adaptations. The gameplay will feature a 3v7 asymmetrical multiplayer structure, where players must work together to defend the town of Crescent Cove from the evil alien clowns.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ_YJaniCXs
"It's a total bucket list item to get to work on the next chapter of such an iconic horror IP," said executive director Randy Greenback.
"When we first heard that someone wanted to make a Killer Klowns from Outer Space game, we all had the same initial reaction: finally," said the Chiodo Brothers, who are executive producing the project. "But nothing could have prepared us for the experience that the Good Shepherd Entertainment and Teravision teams were creating. We are thrilled by the sheer passion these folks share for the world of Killer Klowns and the care they have invested in bringing it to life in surprising new ways."
Killer Klowns from Outer Space: The Game is set to release sometime in early 2023 for Steam, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, and PS5. You can also check out the beta now, just go to the game's website for more info.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Something Wicked Games, a new studio made up of developers whose credits include Fallout 4 and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, has revealed its first game, Wyrdsong, in a new trailer. 
The trailer was released as part of the Gamescom Opening Night Live showcase hosted by Geoff Keighley, and while it was short, it featured plenty of mystery and fantasy intrigue.
Check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see in the trailer above, there's not too much to glean from it. However, we did note what was said by the narrator during it: "In the cracks of reality, there exists two lives, one before the shadow and one behind the eye." Sounds spooky. 
"Wyrdsong is an occult historical fantasy RPG set in a fictionalized Portugal in the middle ages," a press release reads. "Players will be challenged to question both their reality and the choices they make as Wyrdsong is set to expand, question, and re-define aspects of what makes up the current Role Playing Game genre." 
Shortly after the trailer's release, Jeff Gardiner, an ex-Bethesda Studios dev with credits in Fallout 76, Skyrim, Fallout 4, and more, posted a link on Twitter that leads to the newly-launched Something Wicked Games website. 
"Our goal with Something Wicked Games is to utilize our independent and creative autonomy to create the next evolution of open world RPGs," Gardiner, who is the founder and CEO of Something Wicked Games, writes in a press release. "Our first project, Wyrdsong, has been my dream game for some time now, and I'm thrilled to finally share it today." 
A press release also states the game is being developed in Unreal Engine 5.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[That's quite a jam to get out of
Keeping a band of survivors alive on earth can be a tall enough order, but what about a game set on an alien world? That's the premise of Stranded: Alien Dawn, a simulation-minded survival strategy game from Haemimont Games, the developer of Surviving Mars.
We got our first look at Gamescom Opening Night Live.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZI8Bx5yQzg
As much as the art direction isn't blowing me away, it's a solid concept.
Players will need to face random story events, alien attacks, and adverse weather in Stranded: Alien Dawn, according to the team. "However, actions have consequences and as you strive to plan ahead, you must make difficult choices to shape the story of your survivors, balancing short and long-term outcomes with risk and reward."
If you keep your marooned survivors around long enough, you'll be able to upgrade a "simple shelter" into a "high-tech outpost," complete with automated defenses and a space pad. They might not make it easy, though — your people have positive and negative traits. "Only by improving their skills and maximizing their potential will you survive."
Stranded: Alien Dawn will launch on PC with a Steam Early Access version in October 2022.
Haemimont plans to take "at least six months" to finish building out the game before its finalized PC release, with a price increase expected when that day comes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Squanch Games has released a new trailer for its upcoming first-person shooter High On Life, and this time, we get to watch our protagonist take down a boss. 
This trailer, which aired during today's Gamescom Opening Night Live presentation, highlights a fight between our protagonist and their loud-mouthed weapons and 9-Torg, an alien boss. The boss fight features some standard point-and-shoot combat, but it also features some platforming too by way of a grapple hook-like knife tongue thing in your arsenal. Because the weapons have personalities and speak, you'll get to hear said knife tongue thing drop more f-bombs than ever heard before in a boss fight, too. 
Check out the High On Life 9-Torg boss fight trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, the boss fight looks like a great time, and it deserves some props for being more than just a who-shoots-who-more type of battle. High On Life hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC (via Steam and the Epic Games Store) on Dec. 13. 
For more, watch the High On Life reveal trailer from earlier this summer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anakin Skywalker doesn't like sand, but developer Deck13 Interactive is hoping you will love it in Atlas Fallen, a new action/RPG experience that is all about the grainy substance. This Focus Entertainment-published title debuted at Gamecom Opening Night Live, and is slated to release in 2023 for PlayStation 5 Xbox Series X/S, and PC.
The game is set within the sands of a timeless land, and the protagonist can unleash sand-powered abilities and infuse sand into shape-shifting weapons. The sand arsenal is used to hunt legendary monsters in either a single-player or cooperative campaign. In the cinematic trailer, we see one hero use sand to repair a bridge, and another hero glide along the sand like she's on a hoverboard. Together, the heroes create various weapons with the sand, like a whip, to down a handful of alien dogs. We'll have to wait to see how closely the gameplay mimics the cinematics.
Deck13 Interactive is the studio behind Lords of the Fallen and The Surge series of games.]]></summary>

Beyond that, I'm not sure I can say anything. Developers Build A Rocket Boy describe it as "an original multi-world experience" that "will blend gameplay, adventure, creativity, and discovery in a space that blurs the line between reality and the digital world".
So it will probably be either like Roblox or like Second Life, then? Hopefully we'll get a greater sense of which by the time it's out, which will be in 2023. The teaser trailer is a montage of stuff happening quickly in the shape of the logo.

Built to emulate the collectability, customization, and tactical sophistication of the best tabletop miniature games, Moonbreaker aims to nail the magic and appeal of the real-life hobby, but with some of the approachability inherent to video games. After over an hour checking out the result, I’m convinced Unknown Worlds is onto something.

Just, your best guess, or the squid'll getcha with its weird alien ink. Ready? Go!.... Okay, well congratulations to anyone who said "a turn-based strategy game inspired by tabletop miniatures". Unlikely as it may seem you were right, and everyone else was wrong. It's called Moonbreaker and it's hitting early access on September 29. And Brandon Sanderson is at this party, too.
I admit it was a trick question, but look, I'm a genuinely big fan of devs doing a completely different project after a successful game. I also know a whole lotta people who love painting plastic fighters in cool colours, carefuly placing them on a tabletop, and slowly pushing them into other plastic fighters in different colours. I'm absolutely sure that Unknown Worlds will make a very good version of a digital tabletop strategy game. I must admit, though, that whenever a video game like this emerges, I sort of wonder why tabletop-thusiasts would buy it instead of more actual miniatures.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We got a super in-depth look at Sonic Frontiers earlier this summer when I traveled to Sonic Team and played the game for more than three hours. Sonic Team was open about many parts of its upcoming open-zone adventure, but one part it has remained tight-lipped on is the Sonic Frontiers release date. Today, we not only got a new trailer for Sonic Frontiers but a release date for the game too.
Revealed today during Gamescom Opening Night Live, we now know that Sonic Frontiers launches on November 8. The trailer shown during the livestream gave us a look at a second island in the Starfall Islands: Ares Island. In stark contrast to the first island we saw – Kronos Island – Ares Island appears to be a desolate, sandy biome.


Sega and Sonic Team also revealed the pre-order bonuses and the two editions players can choose from. The standard edition of Sonic Frontiers includes the base game (physical or digital), with a pre-order bonus of the Adventurer's Treasure Box, which includes skill points, Red Seeds of Power, and Blue Seeds of Defense. The Digital Deluxe edition includes a digital copy of the game, the Explorer's Treasure Box, which includes Amy's Memory Tokens, a Portal Gear, Chaos Emerald Vault Keys, and additional shoes and gloves for Sonic, and the Digital Art Book with a 25-track digital mini soundtrack. If you pre-order the Digital Deluxe edition, you also get the Adventurer's Treasure Box. The standard edition is listed for $60, while the Digital Deluxe edition is listed for $70.
Sonic Frontiers launches on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on November 8. For more in-depth Sonic Frontiers coverage, head to our exclusive coverage hub here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Callisto Protocol graced the cover of our magazine a few months ago and is currently one of the most anticipated games of the year. Glen Schofield, creative director of the new space horror adventure and one of the leading designers on the Dead Space franchise, made an appearance at Gamescom 2022. He thanked fans for the positive response and spoke about the gritty new gameplay trailer, “We’re gonna show combat and something new with a crazy ending.” 


Protagonist Jacob Lee pulls a health item with one of his abilities and proceeds to crouch-sneak his way through a group of prowling monsters. He downs one with a stab to the back and fires at another creature, stumbling toward him with tentacles squirming around its exposed belly. To top things off, he brawls with a regenerating creature adorned with cysts and sends it flying into a chainsaw-like structure in the environment. 
In the next scene, Lee slides down a sewage drain while dodging deadly pillars along the dimly-lit channel. And in a shocking ending, reminiscent of the death scenes from Dead Space, the leading man hits a massive propeller obstructing the tunnel and gets ripped in half (I’ll spare you the gory details). Schofield warned the trailer’s ending would be wild, and it did not disappoint.
The Callisto Protocol launches for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on December 2.]]></summary>

The trailer was revealed during today's Gamescom Opening Night Live showcase hosted by Geoff Keighley and while it didn't feature much by way of gameplay, it did give us plenty of new glimpses of magic. In particular, it showed us that we might have access to unforgivable curses such as the Cruciatus Curse in the game. Crucio is essentially a curse that allows you to torture whomever or whatever you use it on – it's very much of the Dark Arts side of magic and as the name suggests, hard to forget and even harder to forgive in the world of Harry Potter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dune: Awakening was announced today during Gamescom's Opening Night Live event. While details on the game are scant, the trailer revealed it's an open-world MMO, and a beta sign-up is available now. 
The trailer tells us little to nothing about the game. It shows a character staring down onto a vast desert while narration waxes poetic about overcoming fear. Then, a giant sandworm comes forth from the ground below, and our character jumps down to face the gigantic beast. Check out the trailer below:


While the trailer didn't reveal much, a press release distributed after the fact did. Here's what it had to say:

Dune: Awakening isn't the only game coming out on the heels of last year's mega-blockbuster Dune adaptation. Back in April, Dune: Spice Wars, a real-time strategy game, was released in early access.  
Awakening is expected on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With over three million copies sold, 2014's Lords of the Fallen was destined for a sequel. Publisher CI Games has long desired to bring a follow-up to market, but those plans haven't gone as planned, and the sequel bounced between several development studios before landing at Hexworks. During today's Opening Night Live festivities for Gamescom, we were treated to our first look at Hexworks' The Lords of the Fallen through a violent three-minute cinematic trailer that highlights the differences between the realms of the living and dead.
Set one thousand years after the original, The Lords of the Fallen is designed with cooperative play in mind, allowing two players to experience uninterrupted online play. A press release describes the game as an "expansive RPG experience filled with NPC quests, compelling characters, and rich narrative." The world is also said to be five times larger and interconnected. The focus is once again on soulslike combat, said to be faster than the precursor game with a touch of "devastating magic."
While we hear the voice of Stranger Things actor Joseph Quinn in the trailer, players will be creating their own identities. It's unknown if Quinn will be featured in the game or if he just narrated the trailer. The Lords of the Fallen doesn't have a release date yet, but will release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.
The world of soulslike games has evolved significantly since Lords of the Fallen hit the market. What are you hoping to see from the sequel? Let us know in the comments section below!]]></summary>

Everywhere’s reveal trailer showed a montage of disparate gameplay and art styles, from more cartoony racing to sci-fi to realistic human characters. As its name implies, Everywhere hopes to offer a variety of experiences both user-created and otherwise. Its newly launched website offers this description:
“Everywhere seamlessly blends gameplay, adventure, creativity and discovery in an all-new multi-world gaming experience that redefines how players connect with one another and with the digital world around them.”
“Our intent has always been to push the boundaries of what a videogame can be while still delivering an innovative player-first experience,” said Benzies. “The team we’ve built and the partners we’ve made since our founding are coalescing around the unique vision we’re bringing to life. It’s exciting to be a part of, and we can’t wait to reveal more about Everywhere in coming months.”
Everywhere is slated to arrive in 2023, though no platforms were specified.]]></summary>

Longtime fans as well as potential newcomers have a lot to be excited about.

That’s along with a host of changes coming to the core game experience.
Lightfall will arrive on February 28, 2023. The expansion represents the “beginning of the end” of the Light and Darkness Saga that has been unfolding for many years now.

This pack, which was released last December for $24.99, contains the Gjallarhorn Exotic Rocket Launcher, Thorn armor set, a new three-player dungeon, in addition to other goodies. 
Today at 5 p.m. Pacific, Fortnite players can purchase the skins of Ikora, Zavala, and the Exo Stranger, their weapons, and can even drop into the island atop a Sparrow. A new Fortnite island inspired by the Javelin-4 Crucible map is available now and features control-style gameplay. On the flip side, Fortnite ornament sets can be obtained in Destiny 2. 
On September 17, Destiny 2 invades Fall Guys with Guardian-inspired cosmetics, spicy ramen celebration emote, and other accessories.

Although I spent the latter half of last week playing and performance testing it, the worst I saw in terms of bugs, glitches and unintentional chicanery was one temporarily floating pedestrian and a few de-synced execution animations. Only after I committed this clean(ish) bill of health to writing did the game’s wider playerbase discover that it is, in fact, riddled with issues: some benign and hilarious, others irritating and game-breaking. Well fine then, game.
Some of these bug reports have come from inside the house, namely Liam and Rebecca, whose respective characters have a) involuntarily shot out their own windscreen immediately upon entering every single car and b) fallen through the world when attempting to mount a motorcycle. Then there’s former vid bud Colm (RPS in peace), who has found his feet pinned to a car roof before fading away like Marty McFly if his parents split up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Based on a recent Instagram post on the official PlayStation account, we can finally pin down a launch period for the highly-anticipated PSVR2: "Coming early 2023." You can see the corresponding tweet below.
Coming early 2023. #PSVR2 pic.twitter.com/R3MwWVPyNt
August 22, 2022
While the announcement is relatively brief, we do know PSVR2 will release with over 20 major first-party and third-party games, including new titles like Horizon: Call of the Mountain and ports of Resident Evil Village, No Man's Sky, and The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners Ch. 2. Additionally, the system boasts new orb-like controllers with haptic feedback and adaptive triggers (like the DualSense), a single cord setup with PlayStation 5 consoles for ease-of-access, a see-through view, and better resolution/tracking – we're talking two different modes of visual fidelity. 
According to our very own Marcus Stewart, "VR mode displays VR content in a 360-degree view in 4000 x 2040 HDR video format (2000 x 2040 per eye) and 90Hz/120Hz frame rate. Cinematic Mode lets players view non-VR media and the PS5 interface in 1920×1080 HDR video format with 24/60Hz and 120Hz frame rate."
PSVR2 drops in early 2023, with a specific date to be announced at some point in the future.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To call the current state of the world today ‘tumultuous’ would be a bit of an understatement. For LGBTQ+ people - and trans people in particular - the increasingly extreme rhetoric and legislation being weaponised against these communities can feel all-consuming. Yet it comes at a time when diverse representation in media, including games, is improving. As the number of characters stated to LGBTQ+ grows, what is more effective representation: making it possible to see your own experiences on screen, or make those experiences understandable to someone who isn't LGBTQ+?


People who know of it would perhaps cite the work of developer and translator npckc, who I recently spoke with at the recent Japanese indie gaming event Bitsummit. They were there to showcase their latest game A Pet Shop After Dark, a departure from visual novels like A Year Of Springs trilogy into horror storytelling ("more spooky than outright horror," as they later clarified) that's set to release later this month. Beyond the trilogy and their newest work, they’ve translated the works of other developers and worked on other smaller games and game jam projects.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The last year or so of Elite Dangerous has been the most dramatic since the game launched in 2014. The most recent update to Frontier Developments' epic space sim, Update 13, saw the conclusion of the story's Azimuth Saga, culminating in a disastrous attempt to stop the incursion of the Thargoids – Elite's hostile race of insectoid aliens. It's an event that has already had a major impact on Elite's universe, and Frontier are excited to discuss the studio's plans for the game and its narrative as it pushes into a new phase for the galaxy, simply known as "Aftermath".
But the drama surrounding Elite Dangerous isn't limited to the game's overarching story. As I gear up to chat with lead game designer Luke Betterton and senior producer Samantha Marsh, the Thargoid in the room is Elite Dangerous: Odyssey. Launched in May last year, Elite's second expansion was, to put it lightly, not well received by Elite's community. Complaints ranged from extensive bugs and performance issues to more fundamental criticisms about the implementation of the expansion's on-foot exploration and FPS combat. Over a year on from release, the expansion still carries a "Mostly Negative" rating on Steam, standing in stark contrast to reviews for vanilla Elite Dangerous (now bundled with its Horizons expansion), which remain firmly positive.

The studio and its parent company, Take-Two, are notorious for crackdowns on mods and fan projects, but now it appears they’ve gone after one of the original creators of GTA himself.

This time, it's in relation to a Blade game that Ubisoft are definitely not making. Rumours started circulating online yesterday when a YouTuber posted a video speculating about what possible games will be shown at the Disney and Marvel games showcase taking place next month. Ubisoft making a game based on Marvel's sword-wielding vampire Blade was one of them, and because the internet is the internet, everyone went wild. Today, though, Ubisoft have already killed the rumour dead in a single tweet.

While Deep Silver Volition’s “what if millennials, but crime” reboot is colourful and often quite pretty, you can tell it’s not nearly as interested in cutting edge visuals or contemporary PC tech trappings as the Spidey remaster is. Ray tracing? Yes but only for ambient occlusion. Upscaling? Never heard of it, officer.
The upside - besides Santo Ileso being a generally nice place to visit, as Alice Bee found in her Saints Row review - is that it's playable on low-end and luxury hardware alike. And, to its credit, there's a healthy list of customisable graphics options too. I’ve therefore embraced the past, and spent hours in testing to find out how you can tweak Saints Row’s settings for the best possible performance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s a long-standing theory among the Warhammer community that the chaos wastes at the globe’s south pole house a peculiar breed of beastmen in the form of evil, monstrous penguins. The theory is based on a world with similar geography to our own, and the tendency of the ruinous powers to morph local fauna into mockeries of their previous forms. No ping-gors show themselves as I trawl the southern wastes as stealthy chameleon-skink Oxyotl, but I find myself thinking about them all the same. Noot for the noot god, the blasted crags seem to whisper. Fish for the fish throne.
Evil penguins or not, all things seem possible with Immortal Empires, the combined landmass of the Total War: Warhammer trilogy into a single sandbox map, vast and varied in its climates, landmarks, and inhabitants. Creative Assembly have already dug deep into dusty stacks of White Dwarf to flesh out footnotes into full factions, and as the list of obvious additions dwindle, things can only get wilder and more creative. For now, we have one very big map stuffed with each faction and lord from three massive strategy games, creaking and occasionally buckling under the weight of its own promise. But it works. There’s a breadth of technical and balance issues still to solve, but the Immortal Empires beta is substantially more stable, playable, and enjoyable than I dared to hope it would be for at least another six months.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Saints Row series started off as a sort of rival to Grand Theft Auto, an action-adventure crime sim about working your way up the ranks of a street gang to become the boss. It quickly diverged to become less realistic and more impossibly bombastic, and niched down into giant dildo bats, aliens, reincarnation, and so on. The series has gone to outer space and to hell, so if you're rebooting the series that doesn't leave you many places to go except... backwards.
Saints Row (2022 edition) is back to being a sort of Saints Row again, but also still trying to appeal to people who loved the characters and dick jokes and cartoon carnage of the Saints Row of 2013. If I was being reductive, I'd say it's Saints Row by way of Watch Dogs 2. It isn't bad. It's fun, in fact, but it isn't really doing anything new, either, and I think that's a shame.

The Saints Row reboot features a new cast of characters and a different location to explore, but its heart and soul haven’t changed: Players can once again expect an exciting crime fest, giggle-worthy humor, purple splattered everywhere, and an open-world chock full of things to do and secrets to unearth. The game also has a knack for blowing everything up. In other words, it is great fun in that traditional Saints Row way and even better when experienced with a friend.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Pokémon Company and Nintendo have released a new trailer for Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet, and it showcases a new pocket monster and a few new moves targeted at the competitive play community. 
Released as the finale to the Pokémon World Championship held in London (watch our vlog of it here) over the past few days, the trailer is focused on battles, which makes sense given the nature of the event. In it, we get a look at a new Pokémon, Cyclizar, which looks very reminiscent of the two primary legendaries of this generation, Koraidon and Miraidon. Koraidon is the Scarlet legendary, and it seems rooted in the past whereas Miraidon, the Violet legendary, seems very futuristic. Perhaps Cyclizar represents the present. Only time will tell. 
Check out the trailer for yourself below: 


Beyond Cyclizar, the trailer also reveals a few new moves and items: 
Move: Shed Tail – Create a substitute, then swap places with a party Pokémon in waiting. 
Move: Tera Blast – Changes type when the user has Terastalized.
Item: Loaded Dice – Makes multistrike moves more likely to hit more times. 
Item: Mirror Herb  – Copies an opponent's stat increases when consumed. 

For more about Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, check out this preview detailing everything we recently learned about the Paldea region, new pocket monsters, and Terastalizing. Watch this trailer that welcomes trainers to the Paldea region of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, and then check out all the new Pokémon we spotted in that trailer. 
Are you excited about these new moves or do you think they're too disruptive to the meta of competitive play? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[HBO dropped the first glimpse of footage from its upcoming series, The Last of Us, in a surprise promotional trailer yesterday. 
The trailer runs roughly two minutes and it features new looks at shows like Succession, The White Lotus, House of the Dragon, and more. But then, at the 1:40-min mark, the trailer transitions its hype to The Last of Us. It's clear HBO is aware how excited people are for this series as it's given its own extended spotlight in the trailer. 
Check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see, not only do we get our first glimpse of footage from The Last of Us, but we also get to hear Bella Ramsey's Ellie for the first time as well as Pedro Pascal's Joel (and both are saying some pretty iconic lines from the game). What's more, we get a look at Nick Offerman's Bill and a quick shot of a clicker (well, a dead one that's grown to become part of a wall). 
Here are some screenshots from the trailer if you're after a closer look:

If you're rearing to jump back into the world of The Last of Us, good news: The Last of Us Part 1, a remake of the game this HBO series is based on, hits PlayStation 5 and PC this September. Check out this new trailer that compares The Last of Us Part 1 with the original game after that.

        <updated>2022-08-20T14:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let’s rock, baby! Season 6 of Video Gameography gets stylish as we examine the Devil May Cry series! Over the next few weeks, we’ll be covering the history and lore of Capcom’s premiere action franchise. Today we examine the franchise's boldest, most divisive, but arguably strongest entry yet in DmC Devil May Cry. 
Desiring to shake up the series, Capcom turned to British studio Ninja Theory to reboot and reimagine Devil May Cry. Encouraged by the publisher to be as wildly creative as possible, the team behind Heavenly Sword and Enslaved: Odyssey to the West dreamed up a grittier version of Dante who inhabits Limbo City, a world existing in parallel with the demonic realm. This relationship spectacularly manifests in the city itself coming to life, shifting its buildings and roads to hinder and assault the demon slayer. 
Sporting jet black hair and the ability to tap into angelic and demonic powers, this new vision of Dante garnered heaps of vitriol from fans who saw DmC as too drastic of a departure, despite the game launching to rave reviews. In this episode, we'll examine how DmC came to be, the role Capcom played in the game's wildest ideas, Hideaki Itsuno's reaction to the project, the backlash Ninja Theory endured, and give our overall impressions of the narrative and gameplay. 
Join hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), former GI editor John Carson (@John_Carson), and with special guest Bob Buel (@bobbbackwards) of the 99 Questions podcast as we unpack and pay respects to Ninja Theory's memorable stab at Devil May Cry.

I usually see a load of shows but most my favourite performers aren't up this year and I've not heard much about the sort of weird performance art I relish. Plus the crowds are the absolute worst, especially under covid. Residents should receive legal dispensation to throw one (1) oblivious cluster of path-blocking lollygaggers into a wall each week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You know what it's like at the beginning of a new year. You're all excited about the many tens and hundreds of new video games coming out over the next 12 months, and you go and make a big list of all the ones you're really looking forward to. We did exactly that back in January of this year, coming up with a list of our 43 most anticipated games of 2022. Lately, though, it seems we can't go a single day without word of yet another game being delayed, whether it's just by a couple of months, or that it's been taken off the calendar entirely.
It got me thinking. How many of those 43 games are even still on the table this year? And, more importantly, what does that mean for RPS as we head into the back-end of 2022? Well, I went back and counted, folks, and it's not great reading. At time of writing, just over half that number - 27 in total - are still slated for a 2022 release right now, although with many still listed as a very vague '2022' or 'Coming Soon' on their Steam pages, I wouldn't be surprised if that number fell further. Needless to say, I'm not sure 2022 will go down as one of the great gaming years... 2023, on the other hand? Wow, that's looking rad.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MultiVersus was the best-selling game in the U.S. last month, despite being a free-to-play title, due to its premium Founder’s Pack. 
The Founder’s Packs for MultiVersus came in three forms: a $39.99 standard edition, a $59.99 Deluxe edition, and a $99.99 Premium edition. These packs could be purchased to grant players things like character tokens for instant fighter unlocks, exclusive banners, and the premium in-game currency, Gleamium. It seems these packs sold extremely well in the U.S. as they brought in enough money to make MultiVersus the best-selling title in the U.S. in July, according to the latest NPD numbers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Galactic alliances aren’t built in a day, a month or even a year, to warp a comfortingly familiar phrase from 90s telly. Interplanetary 4X Stellaris has been evolving for more than six years now, having first released on May 9th 2016. Unusually, I remember exactly when I bought the game, because it was in the days just before my partner and I welcomed our first child. Being a ginormous sci-fi nerd, I enthusiastically downloaded it thinking I’d have all the space-time in the universe to invest in building my own interstellar superpower.
I did dip my toes in back then, and have many, many times since, but rather naively didn’t foresee the inevitable. The structure of my life altered dramatically with the arrival of our baby. It didn’t stop there either, and still hasn’t, taking on some unfamiliar but just about recognisable form every few months. I suspect the developers of Stellaris had a similar feeling following the game’s release into the wider universe, like Kubrick’s giant cosmic infant at the end of 2001: A Space Odyssey. I know I’ve felt like my furniture’s been rearranged whenever I’ve started a new game of Stellaris with a different civilisation over the intervening years.

Once there, players can explore iconic Dragon Ball locations like Kami’s Palace, Goku’s house, and the Room of Spirit & Time. Plus, players can duke it out in the PvP battle arena, “Tenkaichi Budokai.” 

“We’re thrilled to partner with Epic Games and bring this first-ever Toei Animation franchise integration to Fortnite,” Toei Animation Inc. director of global marketing, Lisa Yamatoya, writes in a press release. “Over the last 36 years, the Dragon Ball franchise has built perhaps the largest global fanbase of any anime. And this multi-generational mainstream audience makes Dragon Ball ideally suited for a collaboration with Fortnite and its worldwide community of players. We’re excited to see the response to Dragon Ball’s arrival in Fortnite.” 
Epic Games notes that, in case you missed it, there are already Dragon Ball creative islands available in the game for you to visit. There are multiple Dragon Ball Super Episode Festival islands, and from now until Sept. 17, you can board a cruise ship and watch select episodes from Dragon Ball Super on them. Both these islands and the new Dragon Ball Adventure island were created by Vysena Studios.

I've spent some time with the game's early levels and it perfectly captures what I'd consider to be a 'classical' Soulslike: a game that's heavily focused on The Combat Bit above all else.
Does the game's combat rule? Yes, without a doubt. But will I continue playing? I'm not so sure. From what I've sampled, one strong pillar might not be enough to hold my attention for much longer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Golf games seem to be having a bit of a renaissance right now. From their beginnings on the fairway fringes of Flash-game forums, we now have been blessed with a handful of fun indie golf sims. We’ve seen the bizarre buffoonery of What The Golf?, the high-speed, eye-popping courses of Golf With Your Friends, and Secret Mode recently completely threw the clubs out the window and replaced them with highspeed motorcars in Turbo Golf Racing.
It's safe to say that golfing games are always full of shenanigans and Cursed To Golf is no different. Playing as a golfer who has been cast into Golf Purgatory, you need to golf your way back to the land of the living, completing all eighteen holes in one roguelike run. It’s a fun premise and the game bursts with silliness and personality, but unfortunately Cursed To Golf fails to iron out certain roguelike frustrations. After mistiming a shot in the game’s final area and being sent back to the beginning (ending an excruciating four-hour run time), I truly did feel cursed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Soldier Boyz is the newest supported game of the Hypno engine, and it’s ready for public testing!
Released in 1997 by Hypnotix and published by DreamCatcher Interactive and MCPA Interactive, this full-motion rail shooter is based on the 1995 film of the same name. The game starts when the daughter of an American billionaire is kidnapped by a group of Vietnamese terrorists. Then, it’s up to Major Howard Toliver, ex-Marine and highly decorated Vietnam veteran, to gather a deadly team for the dangerous mission of rescuing her. He recruits six prison inmates serving life sentences for a chance at a full presidential pardon.
Keep the body count rising to survive five territories by playing as each Soldier Boy (and Girl),
but beware and don’t waste a “friendly” since they provide vital survival information!
ScummVM currently supports the English release of the game (which is the only one we know about) and features more responsive controls than the original. We couldn't find a demo but there is a trailer. Please contact us if you have a demo or any other release.
To play the game with ScummVM, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.

I don't know, what does Batman like?). A couple of weeks ago, with no new mainline Arkham game since 2015's Arkham Knight, they started discussing Batman: Arkham World, a fourth game in the series that came out in 2021. Except, of course, it does not exist.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[High On Life, the upcoming first-person shooter from Justin Roiland's Squanch Games, has been delayed. 
Originally due out this October, High On Life will now hit Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC on December 13, 2022. It joins various other games delayed this week like Planet of Lana and Evil West, and for a similar reason: the team needs more time to make this game the best it can be. 
Here's the studio's statement about the delay, in full: 
"We have good news and bad news. Feel free to choose the option you'd prefer to read first; we won't meddle with your free will. 
The Good News: High On Life is still coming in 2022! The team at Squanch Games is working hard towards developing the best gaming experience to hit your screens, and a little extra time to squash some bugs never hurts. With that in mind, our new launch date is set to December 13, 2022. 
The Bad News: It's a game delay, sorry! Because we're making you wait an additional 6-ish weeks, please accept the linked animation as an apology. 
"High On Life will be available via Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Windows PCs, Day One on Xbox Game Pass, PC Game Pass, and through Xbox Cloud Gaming. Thank you for your continued patience and support." 
As for the linked animation mentioned in the statement above, it's what you can watch below: 
While you wait for High On Life, please find this 500 pound, diaper-wearing alien a wife. Please. He won't leave me alone.

August 18, 2022
As you can see, it's very Justin Roiland. Enjoy!

That’s a fun headline to read, right? And it’s true because after teasing earlier this week that Kojima Productions’ Death Stranding was coming to PC Game Pass, Xbox announced that it hits the service next week. 
More specifically, Death Stranding will hit PC Game Pass next Tuesday, Aug. 23. Now, this might be somewhat surprising for those not caught up on Death Stranding’s journey from PlayStation 4, to PlayStation 5, and then PC. Sony and PlayStation funded Kojima Productions’ development of Death Stranding, and it’s a PlayStation intellectual property. 
However, a PC port was published by 505 Games, and it seems 505 Games and Kojima Productions are free to determine the whereabouts of the PC port of this game. As such, it’s now coming to PC Game Pass, a service owned by…]]></summary>

This was nothing to do with the file itself; even being near another laptop playing the song could cause a crash. According to Microsoft, one of the sonic frequencies in Rhythm Nation coincided with the natural resonant frequencies of a particular laptop hard drive, making it crash. Amazing. Perfect. A perfect bug.

The group of bounty hunters gathers in their favorite bar once more. For the first time, protagonist Ringo pays attention to the lush cherry blossom decoration over the rooftop. Her friends say the real ones are even more beautiful and laugh at the idea of a bunch of Devil Summoners having a picnic and watching the flowers. The friendly mockery leads to a funny yet endearing message: “I think we oughta show Ringo the fun side of being human, don’t you?” Sadly, Soul Hackers 2 doesn’t seem to agree with the sentiment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I often grumble about remasters and 'HD texture packs' making classic games look worse than the original (heck, I don't even play Quake with newfangled texture filtering). And yet, I am delighted by a new Doom mod which replaces all the sprites for enemies and items with new 3D forms. The secret is voxels, carefully recreating those old 2D sprites in 3D pixels. It's pretty great, in a 'makes the game actually look the way I had remembered it' sort of way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enix have made a vast array of RPGs over the years, but rarely have they ventured into the realm tactics and strategy games. A couple of big names come to mind, the obvious one being Final Fantasy Tactics, Tactics Ogre if you count their PSP remake of Quest's SNES original, and most recently, Triangle Strategy on the Switch. Outside of that, though, it's all a bit barren, which is why the real-time tactical sword-swinging of their upcoming strategy RPG The DioField Chronicle is such an interesting landgrab for them. To say they're pushing into new territory would be an understatement. 
Happily, judging by the sizable first chapter of the game (currently available to play for free on Steam until the game's release on September 22nd), it's clear that Square Enix and their development partners at Lancarse have a lot of smart decisions here. With its focus on individual hero characters instead of nameless military units, mixed in with the magical pizazz and flashy summons of its Final Fantasy games, The DioField Chronicle could just be the Fire Emblem-shaped hole PC players have been looking for.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Phoronix změřil výkon obou generací ARM SoC rodiny Apple Silicon oproti nejnovějším Ryzenům od AMD a Core 12. generace od Intelu. Výsledky jsou poměrně zajímavé, v průměru lze říci, že Ryzeny (konkrétně Ryzen 9 5900HX a Ryzen 7 Pro 6850U) jsou stále nejlepší, Intel je v závěsu (model Core i7 1280P), ale Apple M2 už k dotažení moc nechybí (M1 pak není o moc horší). Bavíme se přitom o linuxových testech, kde podpora čipů rodin M1 a M2 je teprve vyvíjena, přičemž Apple spíše linuxové podpoře naházel klacky pod nohy, kterými se vývojáři z Asahi Linuxu už více než rok a půl postupně prokousávají.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Free your mind for yet another ScummVM release!
Nine newly supported games on 6 engines will plunge you into a variety of different settings. Are you able to escape from an alien-infested planet? What about challenging the Lord of the Dead in the Underworld? And have you ever explored the deepest depth of your psyche to see if you really know yourself?
Find out in one of the following titles:
Sanitarium
Hades Challenge
Marvel Comics Spider-Man: The Sinister Six
The 11th Hour
Clandestiny
Tender Loving Care (CD-ROM Editions)
Uncle Henry's Playhouse
Wetlands
Chewy: Esc from F5
Besides adding new games, we are always focused on improving already supported games. Once again, we managed to squash quite a few bugs from various engines. It is always impressive to see bugs getting fixed in engines that are more than 20 years old!
One of the main new features of ScummVM 2.6.0 is a completely new way to view your games in an amazing icon grid overview via our launcher. Accompanied by some very shiny artwork provided by our graphics artists, you are now able to show off your collection like never before. It almost looks and feels like a virtual shelf!
Check out the full Release Notes for a comprehensive summary of how our developers managed to make ScummVM even more amazing!
You can find all of this goodness available for a number of platforms on our downloads page. If you are using Windows, macOS or the Ubuntu Snap package, the autoupdater will assist you in updating to ScummVM 2.6.0.
As always, thank you for your continuous support — happy adventuring!
