        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Halo marketing is pretty much always top-notch, and the marketing campaign behind Halo Infinite is no different. Just yesterday, 343 released a new (and very hype) Halo Infinite campaign trailer, and today, Swarovski – yes, the famed crystal maker – revealed two new Halo Infinite-inspired crystal figurines. 
As part of its Swarovski x Halo Collectibles collection, the company has created a crystal Master Chief Helmet, complete with a yellow-tinted visor, and a crystal Energy Sword, as reported by GameSpot. You can check out both below:

“In celebration of the game’s 20th anniversary and the launch of Halo Infinite, Xbox and Swarovski step into the epic sci-fi universe with two collectible crystal figurines,” Swarovski’s website reads. “A unique collaboration for both brands that serves as a reminder of what self-discovery and imagination can do. Created in an extremely limited-edition run, only the bold will reap their rewards. Enter your information below for a chance to win one of 117 [we see what you did there] Swarovski x Halo collectibles.” 
As mentioned above, Swarovski is not selling these (we don’t even want to know what the price tag would be), and the only way to get your hands on one of 117 of these crystal figures is to enter the company’s drawing. You can register for that on the Swarovski site. 
While waiting to see if you win one of these crystal figurines, read about how Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers will get monthly Halo Infinite multiplayer bonuses starting next week and then read about how a new change in multiplayer makes it so that players earn increased XP for the first six matches played on any given day. Check out the best Halo Infinite multiplayer tips we’ve learned from watching TikToks after that.

Game Informer’s own reviewer said 2042 is “an otherwise solid online shooter bogged down by an abundance of bugs,” and that’s a sentiment echoed across the entire battlefield discourse. To EA and DICE’s credit, though, the team behind the game has been open about the things it needs to fix, and Update 3, which hits the game tomorrow, is another example of that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cat hair moustache?
The first golden age of the point-and-click adventure was brief. Just moments after Lucasfilm Games graduated from the kindergarten clunk of Maniac Mansion, The Dig was in its Spielberg-endorsed grave. That was 1987 to 1995. Everyone agrees the early '90s were where it was at – even those who wrongly preferred Sierra Online. (See you in the comments!)
Sierra-philes and Lucas-fans alike are united in sorrow by the words “cat hair moustache”, the eternally-echoing death knell of the genre's golden age which came gonging out from Gabriel Knight 3’s infamous doppelgänger sequence. But Beyond a Steel Sky invites you to pretend that never happened. It’s a straight follow-on from Revolution Software’s 1994 critical darling Beneath a Steel Sky, recreating its charm and depth for 21st century gamers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Respawn Entertainment has announced that its first game, 2014’s multiplayer-only Titanfall, has been delisted from storefronts and will remain delisted for good. 
This means that anyone who doesn’t own Titanfall digitally will now not be able to as it’s no longer available for purchase on digital storefronts. However, you could still technically find a physical copy and own it that way. Titanfall will also be removed from subscription services on March 1, 2022, which means it’ll be taken off Xbox Game Pass and EA Play that day. 
Fortunately for those that do already own it, Respawn says it’s keeping servers live so actually playing it is still possible for the foreseeable future. 
studio’s official announcement on Twitter reads. “It’s a game that showcased the ambitions of the studio when it was first released more than 7 years ago and it continues to be a beacon of innovation that we strive for in all of our games.

We’ve made the decision to discontinue new sales of the original Titanfall game starting today and we’ll be removing the game from subscription services on March 1, 2022. We will, however, be keeping servers live for the dedicated fanbase still playing and those who own the game and are looking to drop into a match. 

Rest assured, Titanfall is core to Respawn’s DNA and this incredible universe will continue. Today in Titanfall 2 and Apex Legends, and in the future. This franchise is a north star for the caliber of experiences we will continue to create here at Respawn. Thank you from the entire Respawn team.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solar Ash is due out tomorrow, December 2, on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC, and what better way to build the hype than with a new launch trailer. 
Heart Machine just released the launch trailer for Solar Ash today and if you’ve been keeping up with this game since its announcement back in 2020, then you already know this trailer features beautiful art and sound, and of course, extremely memorable locales. These locations not only feature stunning imagery in art but massive colossus-like creatures that fill the space and provide on-the-go platforms for Solar Ash’s main protagonist, Rei. 
Click here to watch embedded media


As you can see in the trailer above, a spooky narrator warns that “you can’t save anyone, even yourself,” in an ominous voice that's present throughout. 
If you’re unfamiliar with Solar Ash, it’s the latest game from Heart Machine, the developer behind Hyper Light Drifter. It’s being published by Annapurna Interactive, which often means you’re in for a treat of a game. In it, you control Rei, a spacefaring spelunker who explores alien planets for resources, artifacts, and more while traversing environments through rollerskating-like mechanics. Rei’s world then becomes threatened by a massive black hole known as the Ultra Void (which you can see in the trailer) which she must make her way through it in order to save all that she knows. 
Solar Ash was originally due out October 26, but it was delayed to December 2 to give Heart Machine more time to polish the game and squash bugs. While waiting for tomorrow, check out Game Informer’s interview with some of the Solar Ash developers and then watch this trailer first shown during E3 2021. 
Are you picking up Solar Ash tomorrow? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the earliest Nintendo game updates we can remember.

We're in a gaming era of plentiful patches, where it's common for games to get frequent updates starting on day one. There are some rare releases even today that receive either no updates or very few — unless there are frequent DLC additions — and one of Nintendo's selling points is its focus on detail and quality when it comes to shipped games; for the most part, the company releases titles that are pretty much ready-to-go and not "wait for a few updates to fix things" experiences. Its record is far from a spotless, but compared to the majority of developers a version 1.0 first-party release from Nintendo will likely be a relatively smooth experience.

We've also got the nominations, which include a handful of games on Switch, like Metroid Dread, Death's Door, and even the latest WarioWare.
But if you're wondering how to watch The Game Awards, when it is, or how long it'll run for, we've got you covered.

Except this time it’s not a top-down hack-and-slasher, but a stylish skate to save a civilisation on the brink of collapse. Solar Ash sees you flipping onto the backs of massive monsters and felling them like you’re performing athletic acupuncture. So yes, it does retain something from its predecessor, and that’s the element of cool. This is a cool game. One that excels when it lets you off the leash, only, that doesn’t happen as often as I’d have liked.

However, both Lego DC Super-Villains and Mortal Shell will be playable on PS5 thanks to backward compatibility. 
Last month, the PlayStation Plus lineup consisted of six games: Knockout City, Kingdoms of Amalur: Re-Reckoning, First Class Trouble, The Persistence, The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners, and Until You Fall.

Publisher Whitethorn Games has announced that Wytchwood, a crafting adventure game headed to Switch, will launch on the eShop on 9th December.
We've been intrigued about this one ever since its initial Switch announcement earlier this year; presented in a charming storybook art style, the game has you gathering and growing a range of bizarre ingredients before crafting new things and brewing sorcerous enchantments. It's said to boast a fantastical narrative and will have you using your wit to solve puzzles and conquer the strange monsters of the forest.

Prior to the launch of Metroid Dread we rather enjoyed the multiple 'Reports' that were shared by Nintendo and the development team at MercurySteam. They shared all sorts of lore, history lessons and sneak peaks of the game, but with Dread having now been out for about 6 weeks a 'Special Edition' report has been published to help players out, whether tackling new faster runs or jumping in for the first time.
A section we found interesting relates to the unlockables for quick playthroughs, explaining that it's a tradition of the series and that the timer is relatively generous.

They tend to be fairly minor tweaks, and there hasn't been an experimental update in a little while.

Launching in just a couple of days' time on Nintendo Switch is Paradise Lost, a "post-apocalyptic, alt-history narrative adventure" from publisher All in! Games and developer PolyAmourous.
Now available to pre-order on the eShop, Paradise Lost is perhaps best suited to those looking for an engaging storyline rather than action-packed gameplay. It's an adventure game that'll have you slowly walking around the game's world to discover secrets and tells the story of Szymon, a young boy who uncovers an abandoned Nazi bunker – here's the official synopsis:

Unless you're from Poland, there's a good chance that the names 'Kajko' and 'Kokosz' won't mean an awful lot to you. First published in 1972, Janusz Christa's comic books have often been compared to the Asterix series, and they explore similar themes (the franchise has even been accused of plagiarising Albert Uderzo characters and setting, but we won't go down that particular rabbit hole).
Now, these Slavic warriors are getting a new lease of life thanks to a Netflix animated series, which makes its international debut today. Renamed Kayko and Kokosh, the series will be accompanied by a Switch-exclusive video game, expected to arrive in the first quarter of 2022.

Firegirl: Hack 'n Splash Rescue is a rather promising upcoming 'roguelite', with eye-catching visuals and all sorts of mechanics based around dousing fires. Unfortunately it's been confirmed today that while it's still hitting its 14th December release on PC, its console versions (including Switch) have fallen back to 2022.
This has been done to ensure it's properly optimised and ready to go, of course, so hopefully the extra development time will pay off. If you're still not sure what this one will be all about, the official description below should help.

Starting next week, it’s going to get even better for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers. 
That’s because Microsoft has announced that Ultimate members will get monthly multiplayer bonuses. The first bundle will go live on December 8.

“It’s an awesome time for Perks because we’re excited to reveal that Ultimate members will be locked in to get monthly Halo Infinite multiplayer bonuses, starting with your first bundle on December 8,” an Xbox Wire blog post announcing this month’s upcoming Game Pass additions reads. “Don’t forget to claim this and more in the Perks gallery on your Xbox console, Xbox App on Windows PC, and Xbox Game Pass mobile app.” 
This month’s bonus is the “Pass Tense” MA40 AR Bundle, and it comes with an exclusive “Pass Tense” MA40 Assault Rifle coating, as the bundle’s name would suggest, along with four 2XP Boosts and four Challenge Swaps. You can check out the bundle above, which includes a look at the new AR coating. 
While waiting for this bundle to go live next week, check out this post detailing everything available in the Halo Infinite multiplayer shop this week. Then read about how 343 Industries has updated multiplayer progression to give players increased XP in the first six matches of a given day. This new bundle goes live the same day Halo Infinite’s campaign launches, and to get prepared for that, check out this recently-released Halo Infinite campaign trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I loved The Forest. My small team of survivors committed a little under forty hours building fortifications around the crash zone, scouring for food and rare weapons in sprawling underground caverns, and keeping cannibals and, later, grotesque mutants at bay. The sequel, Sons of the Forest, got two trailers earlier this year, highlighting a newfound emphasis on storytelling. An unnamed NPC – specifically, a nonvolatile mutant – is slated to be the player’s companion. But beyond montages and short action sequences, previous Sons of the Forest footage inspired more questions than answers. 
A new trailer (seen below) continues that exciting, albeit frustrating, tradition of narrative vagueness. However, this time around, we finally got a release date set for Spring 2022.

Nintendo is far from alone in its pursuit of games – or applications if you prefer – that are designed to give that cauliflower-looking organ within your skull a good thrashing, but the company has often done better with that software than most. Now we have the Big Brain Academy series (which began life on Nintendo DS in the wake of the incredible success of Dr. Kawashima's Brain Training) making its return in Big Brain Academy: Brain vs. Brain on Switch. It's plenty brainy, sure, but is it truly as brawny as it should be?
The basic premise of the game is just like any of the other titles in the series in a most basic sense. There are five disciplines of mental agility, all of which act as categories for four ‘exercises’ apiece tasking you with different… tasks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Next year, a new story-driven DLC is coming to first-person cyberpunk action-platformer, Ghostrunner, and it’s called Project_Hel. 
IGN revealed the news yesterday after developer 505 Games teased the “Ultimate DLC” last week. It turns out that “Ultimate DLC” was Project_Hel, the upcoming story-driven DLC where players will control Hel, one of the bosses from the game. Project_Hel will go live in January, but before that, some players will have the chance to go hands-on with it during a private beta held sometime before the DLC’s launch. 
Hel will be a “combat-oriented character designed to appeal to ‘new players and veterans,’ and will feature her own ability progression system,” according to IGN. The story of Project_Hel will take place over six new missions that task Hel with descending from Dharma Tower, a locale heavily featured in the base game. Alongside new missions, Project_Hel will include new enemies, new bosses, and six new songs from Daniel Deluxe. 
505 Games told IGN that it was initially planned as a smaller DLC before becoming a “full-blown Ghostrunner experience.” It will hit PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PC, and Amazon Luna on January 27. It will cost $14.99.
The studio also revealed that a new Holiday Pack would hit the game on December 7, and it’s a free cosmetics pack that includes holiday swords with matching gloves and more. 
While waiting for Project_Hel to launch in January, read about how native PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions of Ghostrunner launched back in September. Then, check out this flashy neon pack that launched back in August alongside new assist options and a roguelike wave mode. Read about how 505 Games has already confirmed Ghostrunner 2 for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC after that.

It's been quite a year for Sonic the Hedgehog, now 30 years old and perhaps losing a step - after the big 3 and 0 it's all downhill . The Switch iteration of Sonic Colors Ultimate could have certainly been better, but we'd argue that the Sonic 30th Anniversary Symphony was a genuine highlight and delight - it's even on Spotify in all of its glory.
For every high, Sonic fans know there has to be a low, depending on tastes of course. SEGA teamed up with Steve Aoki for a crossover concert that you can see at the top of this page; it's basically Aoki doing a normal gig in front of a greenscreen with some iffy animated Sonic backgrounds. If you watch natively on YouTube there is an option to move the camera, and it supports VR if you have the gear.

Since the launch of the free-to-play multiplayer component, 343 Industries has updated the shop three times. The latest rotation brings a pricey legendary bundle, as well as a cool camo option for your spartan and vehicles (see above).
The biggest bundle is the Anubis Armor Set for the Mark VII Spartan. This set offers the Arctic Void Epic Armor Coating, the Anubis Epic Helmet, a new visor and shoulder pads, and the rather mundane Vigilant Watch stance. It retails for 2,000 credits, which players can purchase for $17.99.
The most visually pleasing option in this week's offering is the Splinter Desert Epic Armor Coating that gives your Spartan a gray camo look. This texture can also be applied to all vehicles. This bundle is 1,500 credits.
If you love seeing your Spartan stand in generic poses, you can purchase the Tacticlamp 117 bundle to get another stance of a Spartan holding a pistol in a rather trivial way. The last item offered is the Reach Falcon Pilot Pack, consisting of a Falcon Nameplate and matching vehicle and weapon Emblems, along with new shoulder pads for your Spartan. This pack requires you have the Mark V armor from the Heroes of Reach Battle Pass. You can see all of the items in the image below:]]></summary>

We're nearly at the end of the year, and by now if a certain game hasn't shown up on the Nintendo Switch it's probably not going to make 2021.
With this in mind, Fall Guys by Mediatonic won't be arriving this year. After being delayed in May the UK-based developer has now provided another update in a new post over on the game's official website - stamping out theories about the Switch and Xbox versions arriving alongside Season 6.

Instead, you can take a look at Starfield in a very different fashion, with a behind-the-scenes look with game director Todd Howard, studio director Angela Browder, and art director Matt Carofano. It’s more of a micro look at Bethesda’s approach to their games, their stories, and their open worlds. It’s more of a conversational approach than a lot of game trailers, but it looks like it’s simply setting the stage for lots more to come regarding Starfield. Check out the full video right here.

This is really just Episode One of a Starfield trailer series, so inevitably there will be a lot more on the way before Starfield’s release. In case you were wondering, Starfield is set to hit on November 11, 2022. That may seem like a long way off, but I’m sure we’ll get to see a lot more from the game as we progress into next year. Yeah yeah, I know. I want to see some serious gameplay slices too. We’ll get there. What do you think it’s going to be like? We do know some things… Expect wars, space pirates, and mysteries to unravel.
Are you excited for Starfield? When do you think Elder Scrolls VI will launch? Do you like discussions like this trailer about games? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Media Molecule has announced Ancient Dangers: A Bat’s Tale, a new playable game the studio made in its 2019 creation game, Dreams.  
The game seems to be centered on two dungeon-crawling protagonists who must battle “hideous monsters” and solve “fiendish puzzles” to advance through Ancient Danger’s medieval setting. There is, of course, loot and wealth to be found throughout each of these dungeons, and there seems to be a cute bat at the center of its story, as the name alludes to.

As you can see in the trailer above, Ancient Dangers looks quite great and it’s tough to picture it as a game made inside Dreams, which is itself a game. Credit to Media Molecule, though, for doing just that. Ancient Dangers looks great, too, which is especially exciting because it’s already out as of today. 
Here’s the official description for Ancient Dangers:
Ancient Dangers is a third-person dungeon crawler, featuring a single-player mode where players control Scoria, and a co-op mode, which adds Scoria’s twin, Gabbro, to the mix. The co-op mode is couch co-op only, though. Media Molecule says new PlayStation trophies have been added to Dreams for players to unlock while playing through Ancient Dangers, too, so if trophy hunting is your thing, you don’t want to miss this.

These jokes have been restored by GTA: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition's latest patch, which corrects spelling on signage, puts the hard angles back on the Tuff Nut logo, and stops it raining indoors quite so often.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Players have had plenty of time to dive into Halo Infinite’s multiplayer experience, but as we move closer and closer to the December 8th launch date, anticipation has been building for the campaign experience as well. After weeks of throwing around the oddball and hacking up competitors with the sizzling sword, is it time to take the campaign trek? Well, here’s the first big trailer from the campaign, unveiled today.

FPS campaigns often range from the mundane to the majestic and we don’t know just where Halo Infinite’s falls just yet. Clearly, much has changed since the underwhelming demo slice of legend that gave rise to big-time internet memes and a fair amount of concern about what the final game would play like. That said, we’ll be looking closely to see what the verdict is as we get closer to launch. While multiplayer hasn’t been without issues, especially ones related to battle pass progression, game customization, and more, overall Halo Infinite’s “return to form” for Halo seems to be well received thus far. Take a look at how the campaign has changed from its initial reveal to now in the video below!

There’s not a whole lot you can extrapolate from a trailer like this except “get hype”, and with a game like Halo, you’re already probably either onboard for what this new campaign experience is poised to serve up or unlikely to be swayed by what’s on deck here. Where do you stand, Spartan? Are you ready to blast off in the new campaign or are you passing on it entirely? If so, are you still in for the free-to-play multiplayer part of the experience?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vampire: The Masquerade – Swansong, the other, other video game based on the popular tabletop game currently in development, has been delayed. It was tentatively set to release in February but is now launching on May 19.
It may be easy to confuse Swansong with the other two Vampire: The Masquerade games also in the works: Bloodhunt, the battle royale launching early next year that's currently playable in Steam Early Access, and Bloodlines 2, the long-awaited sequel to the 2004 game that had its development rebooted. Swansong is a choice-driven narrative RPG that puts you in the role of three vampires in modern-day Boston. 
A new leader has emerged to take control of the city’s sect of vampires, triggering a violent power struggle filled with twists, turns, and betrayal. Each playable vampire hails from a different clan and sports its own unique powers, which can be customized to your liking. Many of those skills influence characters to pry information out of them, using techniques such as persuasion and intimidation. Check out the game’s teaser trailer below.

In a tweet, developer Big Bad Wolf Studio says the delay will allow additional polish to ensure the game’s quality while also letting the team maintain a healthy work/life balance.  Vampire: The Masquerade – Swansong is heading to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

Caves & Cliffs Part 2 arrived today, bringing with it deeper underground layers, taller mountains, and a couple of new biomes to explore. I've been really eager for the 1.18 update specifically so I can build a nice home in the new Lush Cave biomes. Underground houses are the best! And now I can live near pretty cave plants!

Atari are releasing Sid Meier's classic Command series on Steam tonight, so you'll be able to get your hands on Decision In The Desert, Crusade In Europe, and Conflict In Vietnam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the last few weeks I’ve spent a lot of time looking through scopes. Red dots and ACOGs and telescopic ones. From one FPS to the other, I put my eye up to a lens and I press triggers. Sometimes I’m a sniper dropping Nazis to protect my father, sometimes I’m a soldier surrounded by 127 other players. Lately, I’m a chunky spartan with crunchy crayon armour.
All this time with the three big FPSes of the year, each packaged in their own ways, has left me wondering what’s important nowadays. Do they need campaigns, or is multiplayer-only the way to go? How about introducing one a bit later than the other?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Techland has announced Dying Light 2 Stay Human has gone gold and is ready for production, two months ahead of its scheduled release date. 
The company spread the news to Game Informer through a press release, saying the team achieved this milestone over the weekend. Techland's press release also had some words from Tymon Smektała, lead game designer on Dying Light 2. In it, he speaks about how the work on the game isn't quite done yet, saying, "The fact that the game is done and we hit the gold status two months before the release is a great sign but it doesn’t mean that our work ends here. There are still some upgrades and tweaks to add, and community feedback to implement, but the base is solid and ready to play."
So, while much of the work is in the rearview mirror, there's plenty to tweak and fix before the public is finally able to play it. Still, the feat of shipping a game is a massive undertaking and one worth celebrating. Tymon says, "I’m extremely proud of the whole team!" Considering the ups and downs the project faced over the course of a long development process, he should be. 
The next time we'll see Dying Light 2 Stay Human is just around the corner. This Thursday, Techland will premiere Episode 5 in its Dying 2 Know series, where about 15 minutes of new gameplay will be shown. You can find that at 12 p.m. Pacific on Techland's Twitch channel.
Dying Light 2 Stay Human is well on track to hit its February 4, 2022 date to release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch (cloud version), and PC. For more on Dying Light 2, check out Brian Shea's recent preview where he played four hours of the game.]]></summary>

Tactical RPG Wartales gave me the opportunity to promote a wild boar to the captain of my troupe of wandering mercenaries. I did not. Instead, I fell back into stale, boring habits like “entrusting the lives of my comrades to someone with ambitions outside of ‘moar acorns plz’.” Not a moment goes by that I don’t wistfully consider what might have been.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For many of us at Game Informer, Halo Infinite's free-to-play multiplayer is a blast that feels nostalgic and refreshingly new at the same time. However, a point of contention (one that's also been shared by the wider Halo community) is the monotonous grind of accumulating XP points. Infinite's progression system leaves a lot to be desired, and leveling tends to be a painful slog. Initially, 343 Industries implemented an update to give players longer durations for XP boosts (among other features). Today's new update goes a step further and increases XP payouts for the first six matches of each day. 
After seeing how XP was earned with those changes, we noticed that players were starting their sessions with slower payouts than we'd like. To address this, we will be increasing the XP payout …]]></summary>

        <updated>2021-11-29T22:50:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Antstream Arcade is now available on the Epic Games Store, boasting over 1000 games to stream to your PC. We learned of its inclusion in the launcher through a story from the folks over at PC Gamer.
The streaming service has all kinds of games from the arcade, ZX Spectrum, Amiga, SNES, and many more. While the Antstream is free to download and access, gems or a subscription will be needed to play anything. Epic is offering a welcome pack available for free until Thursday for new players to check out the service, which provides 1090 gems to mess around with. Most games cost 30 gems per play, though, for the price of $39.99 a year, you can play any solo or co-op game without having to pay extra.
Antsteam features additional benefits to those playing on its platform, including achievements and challenges. Tournaments are also available, pitting your high scores and feats against others in games like Mortal Kombat, Dig Dug, Chain Reaction, or Marble Madness. Winning or scoring highly in these contests will payout in gems to spend on other games or enter future tournaments.
There looks to be plenty to check out with Antstream Arcade, with many cool old arcade and console games to try. I'm eyeing some of the SNK and Commodore 64 collections, myself. Keep in mind that you aren't downloading any of these games, so making sure you have a strong network connection will be critical for an optimal experience. Along with the addition to the Epic Games Store, Antstream Arcade is available on PC, iOS, and Android devices.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Strategists ready to return to the battlefields of World War II have the chance to play in the Company of Heroes 3 pre-alpha multiplayer test starting tomorrow. 
A video from developer Relic Entertainment, featuring principal producer Morain McLaughlin, details some aspects of Company of Heroes 3 players can expect to play around with during the test. While the final product will include more factions (including the Italian battalion, which will be detailed next year), players will get their hands on the American and German forces. Each military force will feature two battlegroups to explore, replacing the doctrines and commanders from previous games. These battlegroups will offer a tree of abilities, units, and upgrades to select and utilize throughout a match.

The pre-alpha test will primarily be a multiplayer-focused affair, but those who wish to take on the computer-controlled AI in 1v1 or 2-player vs. 2-CPU have the option to do so. If you're playing by your lonesome against the CPU, you'll have access to the tactical pause feature not present in modes with more than one person. 
Other new features available will be outfitting vehicles with side armor, a veterancy system, and verticality in maps. Relic promises more updates in 2022, including new factions, units, and mechanics to be revealed over the coming months.
Preloading is available right now on Steam for established COH-Development account holders. Anyone new to the COH-Development program can head over to the game's community site and sign up for an account there. Company of Heroes 3 is aiming for an unspecified 2022 release date for PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here we are, chums, Cyber Monday. Ahh, how the mighty have fallen. What was once an interesting online addition to the Black Friday feeding frenzy, is now a withered and useless appendage. We all shop online now and Black Friday lasts for at least three months of the year. Well, either that or I’m in some kind of deals post writing, Groundhog Day-esque limbo. Whatever the case may be, Cyber Monday is still a weird 90s relic, like many other things with cyber as a prefix. Cybergoth, for example, a sub-sub-culture whose chief point of relevance in the modern era is having their entire aesthetic appropriated by gaming peripheral manufacturers. You can’t move for black and neon doohickeys with LEDs dripping from every orifice. While I’ll be the first to argue that anything is better than the beige everything of yesteryear, sometimes you need to be a bit grown-up and accessorise your PC with reliable, understated, no-nonsense black. Like this HyperX Cloud Alpha S headset which is now discounted at Amazon.

Samsung’s line of monitors certainly contains models that fit the bill, including the cyclopean Odyssey G9. Sadly, such excess isn’t always practical. Your desk just isn’t big enough or, for some reason, you don’t have a grand just sitting around to spend on a monitor. Despite that, you still want to have a little odyssey, as a treat. An odyssette, maybe? Which I’ve just discovered is a real word and not something I made up for a bad gag. Well, don’t worry, chums, I’m here with a deal on the much more manageable Samsung Odyssey G5, for when you’re feeling just a little bit epic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in August, which is obviously an unfathomable length of time ago, the adverts for a mobile game called Merge Mansion went semi-viral on Twitter. The post was not unwarranted. The twists, the turns, the drama: it all makes Merge Mansion seem like it must be bananas.
In that original advert, a bride gets out of a taxi to find her house (and presumably husband) is on fire. Her grandmother takes care of her and unlocks the gate to a huge mansion, which the woman begins rennovating. Then out of nowhere the cops come and arrest grandma, and she presses her hand to the inside of the police car window where, Lost-style, she's written a message on the palm of her hand reading "He is alive". I was reminded of it this weekend because I saw a similar ad where a policeman comes to the house to arrest grandma and she escapes on a motorbike, pulling a sick wheelie.

In other words, this isn't a Cyber Monday sale per se, though if you were already in a shopping mood from all the other Cyber Monday deals floating around you can still avail yourself of some big savings.
Last year's festive Gamesplanet sale had some major discounts, and this year is no different. There has been a lot of releases to chew through this year, and with the end of lockdown sapping all of our collective motivation away, it meant that some things could slip through the net. But that's where the sales come in, so we can pick up those games we were eyeing up for cheap.

For the most part, feedback from the test looked pretty good, though some players noticed something a familiar - the game reused armour and emotes from Final Fantasy XIV. Producer Yosuke Saito says that's because Square Enix let Platinum borrow them, letting the devs add lots more gear than they had originally planned.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s not something my parents tell their friends, but I am a man who has played every Call Of Duty campaign. I’ve been in more helicopter crashes than you could believe. I’ve seen capital ships on fire off the shoulder of Mars, watched sniper scopes glitter in the smog near Brandenburg Gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain.
Unless I can record them in a big list, of course, clawing back some of that sunk cost in the process. While the COD campaign no longer holds the high ground at the water cooler, where it once dominated pop culture discussion, it’s still a place you can reliably find solo thrills in a world of service shooters. You might be surprised to learn that, despite diminishing returns, some of the best examples are hidden among the duds of the last decade. I’ve made it my duty to point them out to you - the spotter to your artillery.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim, the sci-fi strategy adventure game by Vanillaware (makers of Odin Sphere and Dragon’s Crown), is making its way to Switch on April 12. The game has only been available on PlayStation 4 since it launched in March 2020. 
The game blends side-scrolling visual novel adventure with real-time strategy. Players control 13 ordinary high school students who also pilot giant mech suits called Sentinels. Okay, so they’re not that ordinary. The story primarily revolves around stopping an invasion, but the sci-fi tale branches in all sorts of wacky directions, many of which draw inspiration from stories like War of the Worlds and The Terminator. While you’ll use your mech to defend the world in RTS battles, the real meat of 13 Sentinels is navigating the intertwining, non-linear narratives of the students. Each teenager has their own story arc, and you’ll jump back and forth between them all to uncover the entire bonkers storyline. Take a look at the Switch announcement trailer below for an idea of what to expect.

In our review of the PS4 version, we scored 13: Sentinels an 8 out of 10, with former GI editor Joe Juba describing it as a “fun and ambitious experience that combines high-school drama and huge robots in a (mostly) beautiful package.” You can read our full review here.

“This is not the last movie that we are going to make with Marvel – [this is not] the last Spider-Man movie,” Pascal told Fandango. “We are getting ready to make the next Spider-Man movie with Tom Holland and Marvel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re struggling to make meaningful progression in Halo Infinite’s multiplayer, which launched early as a separate free-to-play package, you’re not alone – 343 Industries’ head of design feels your pain. 
343 head of design Jerry Hook tweeted about a game called Len’s Island and then replied to that tweet to explain that he was playing both Len’s Island and Halo Infinite’s multiplayer. He said he’s feeling everyone’s pain in terms of progression and that the team is working on it, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. 
“Yes I am still playing Halo and feeling everyone’s pain on progression. We are back at it next week and this will be the top of my list with the team.”



Yes I am still playing Halo and feeling everyone’s pain on progression. We are back at it next week and this will be top of my list with the team.
November 28, 2021
As you can see in Hook’s tweet above, work on multiplayer’s progression continues to be a top priority for 343 Industries, which is likely also head down on the Halo Infinite campaign that launches on December 8. One important aspect of the entire discourse surrounding the multiplayer progression is that the game is still technically in beta. 
Yes, 343 Industries is selling a battle pass that costs real money in it and it’s fair to want that battle pass to feel fair, but this beta period for multiplayer was likely enacted for this very reason: to get a feel of the community’s thoughts on it and progression, and make changes based on those feelings ahead of the full December 8 launch.

Only time will tell what changes we see come to Infinite’s multiplayer. For now, read about how 343 is investigating Halo Infinite’s battle pass progression and then check out this breakdown of the recent changes made to it. Be sure to read up on what you can unlock in Halo Infinite’s multiplayer this week after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[End Global 7, a coop company composed of prominent development studios, released a Q3 2021 Investor Presentation that detailed revenue/financial gains and a project pipeline for future IPs. The information packet revealed Dimensional Ink Studios, the team behind DC Universe Online, is working on another MMO. However, this time, players will be suiting up as created Marvel superheroes and (potentially) supervillains. The new Marvel MMO is currently in development, but the unexpected announcement is exciting nonetheless. 
According to the slide entitled "Exciting Product Slate for 2022 and Beyond," Dimensional Ink Studios is coming off a solid year with DCUO cornering the market for successful superhero-based MMOs. The studios' most popular title is celebrating its 10th anniversary and "performing near its peak historical annual revenues." Under the "medium-term" banner (seen above), a graphics overhaul and massive content expansion are in the works and slated for a 2023 release. 
However, under the "longer-term" banner, an unannounced MMORPG is underway. The important bullet points read as follows:
Marvel IP based massively multiplayer online game
Being developed by Dimensional Ink Studios in Austin, TX
Led by Jack Emmert, who designed and helmed City of Heroes, and currently leads DCUO
It'll probably be a long time before we get any notable info about this new Marvel MMORPG. Still, based on Dimensional Ink Studio's pedigree, we can expect to see fun customization options, beloved heroes and villains to interact with, and exciting leveling systems with raid scenarios. 
In other news, a bunch of  games featuring beloved Marvel and DC characters are around the bend. Be sure to check out Marcus Stewarts' Wolverine, Suicide Squad, And The League Of Upcoming Superhero Games piece to learn more.

One portion is a rewarding parkour simulator, and the other’s this heavy, visceral combat system that I never got tired of. You play as a three-armed mutant called Aiden as he hops between planets collecting bounties, which are presented through a series of action-platformer linear levels. It almost never goes as planned. The title’s pretty accurate.

Amazon has it for just £55, which is chump change for a mobo that’s compatible with both AMD Ryzen 3000 chips and the latest Ryzen 5000 series. That’s down from its £73 price tag on Black Friday itself, and down from a £100 RRP.

I’m still here though, highlighting deals for you, because we’re in deals season now and the ride is going to continue all through to Christmas and the New Year beyond! The whole Black Friday phenomenon is very weird if you’re old enough to predate online shopping and not from the USA. Feels like just yesterday that everyone was terrified of using their credit cards online, Amazon was just a book shop and Thanksgiving was just something you only heard of on American TV shows. Now it’s another huge American export, allowing retailers to extend their discounting shenanigans for a whole extra month. The worst thing about it is that our colonial cousins keep some of the best bargains for themselves, as is the case with this Razer BlackWidow V3 mechanical keyboard.

Released on August 27, 2007 for Nintendo's Wii, Metroid Prime 3: Corruption is often considered one of the best games on Nintendo's unique motion sensing console. During today's show we talk about what made 2007 such an phenomenal year and why we Prime 3 often gets overlook in the shuffle. We also talk about how Prime 3 might be the best entry in the Prime series thanks to it innovative motion controls and the Hypermode system, which allowed Samus to dish out some serious damage. Finally, we speculate if Samus is just an intergalactic version of Batman.
Join hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and special guest, lead community producer at Twitch Zach Ryan (@ZachariusD) for the next hour as we explore Metroid Prime's lore, development history, and lasting impact.

I did manage to procure a solid bottom-rest at a good discount and I’m very happy with my purchase. Unfortunately, it still cost a good chunk of change, leaving me with much less to spend on my recently rediscovered Warhammer habit.

Luckily for anyone still looking for somewhere to park their behind while gaming, you can get your hands (cheeks?) on a Razer Iskur gaming chair worth £500 for free. You do have to buy a laptop first though.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Around this time last year, I put out a call for headset recommendations, looking for something cheapish and not terrible. An Internet Friend offered me an old set and I gratefully accepted, not being in the position to turn down free stuff. A few days later, I opened the package that arrived to find, not the slightly dodgy cast-off I’d expected, but a shiny SteelSeries Arctis 5. I’m not someone who gets good quality peripherals very often and the sheer generosity made me shed more than a few tears. Using it is like having an angel gently hug my head while they whisper game noises in my ears.

Which is all just a long-winded way of saying that the SteelSeries Arctis headsets are very good and you should totally check out the SteelSeris Arctis 7 deals we have featured below the jump.

To put it bluntly, the genre is struggling, and even the new console generation hasn’t been the answer to rejuvenating it. Take just this year, for example. Metacritic scores are anything but impressive for the biggest sports around. Madden NFL 22 earned an abysmal 60, NHL 22, which promised to change its metagame, disappointed with a 74. NBA 2K has largely been the franchise to beat, but NBA 2K22 only holds a 76, some of the lowest marks the series has seen in years. FIFA 22 and MLB: The Show 21 earned the highest averages, around 78, but it’s telling that none of these franchises could even crack the 80 mark. 
This downward trend has been going for some …]]></summary>

Beyond gift-giving, if you’ve got a family of your own, you may be trying to come up with ways to keep yourself and the kids entertained over the holiday break from school. Either way, I can say with confidence that a good family board game is worth its weight in gold, both for keeping everyone happily entertained, but also ensuring some fun shared activities to make memories.
The board gaming hobby has no shortage of wonderful family games, but I’ve kept the focus here on mostly newer projects that you may not have heard of. As you consider which game might be right for your family group, make sure and check against the age recommendatio…]]></summary>

Due to my lowly status, I’m not allowed to handle such hallowed items, so I must consult the wisdom of my betters. We haven’t written about the wired HyperX Cloud II 7.1 headset, but Katharine looked at the wireless version, which is the same, but with less wire. Katharine again, hmm? Is this some kind of conspiracy? Is she using her boss lady powers to get all the good stuff? Or did she just used to be our hardware editor? I’ve connected the dots!

In-between the cooking tutorials and cursed comedy sketches populating my For You page, I’ve stumbled upon several Halo Infinite multiplayer tips that positively affected my knowledge and skill.
In the spirit of Thanksgiving – and being the generous person I am – I’d like to give back to the gaming community by sharing a curated list of the best videos I’ve watched while doom-scrolling this hellscape of a social media app.

So, it seems only fitting to end with a glut of great titles to keep players sustained over for the long, dark months ahead. One of our most anticipated games this year, Solar Ash, was originally slated to arrive earlier in the season but is now hitting just ahead of the frostiest time of the year. And while the nights are getting darker sooner, there are still plenty of bright indie launches we’ve got our eye on for the rest of 2021 and beyond.

In games, it seems as if Disney exclusively pours resources into them – yes, there’s Kingdom Hearts, which has been great for decades but it seems that series is heading into a decidedly less Disney-based future – and it’s a shame because the nearly 100-year-old company has so much to offer to the video game space, both to classic fans and new ones alike. That’s why Disney needs to tap into its history.
I love a good Star Wars or MCU flick, and I, for the most part, love a game set in a galaxy far far away or in a Marvel-based timeline. But let’s be honest: we almost always k…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As awards season approaches and I start to compile a list of all the great games I missed this year, there's one game I really regret not covering in more detail at RPS around the time it came out. That game is The Vale: Shadow Of The Crown, an audio-only RPG about a blind princess fighting to save her kingdom. You may have seen it nominated in the Innovation in Accessibility category of The Game Awards this year, and frankly if it doesn't win then a great disservice will have been done. A stark contrast to the other, all very AAA nominees in its category, The Vale doesn't rely on flashy visuals to tell its story. In fact, it barely has any graphics at all. Instead, it conjures its world - and tense fighting sequences - from sound alone, creating an experience like nothing else I've ever played.

He's the dev behind the 2D platformers Starseed Pilgrim and Probability 0, and now Demon Deleter, a game in which you have to delete the names of a bunch of demons from a spreadsheet. It's a simple yet surprisingly fun idea that lets players hang out in this unusual shared space together. The inspiration behind it is pretty random too - droqen tells me he got the idea after spending hours cataloguing items for Animal Crossing.

A game you can boot up, make a few decisions, and then either return to it five minutes later, five hours later, or even five days later.

I'm not sure if that says anything great about my state of mind right now, but hey - the nights are drawing in, there's a bit of a nip in the chip, and it's the time of year when we're encouraged to think about family, found or otherwise.

        <updated>2021-11-26T12:37:25.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently spent a couple of weeks with the Roccat Pyro as my main work and gaming keyboard, and it was a lovely bit of kit for the price; full-size mechanical keyboards rarely cost under £100, yet here was one that started at £90 and had everything a typical PC gamerist could ask for. Now, what with it being Black Friday and all, it’s hit a new lowest price of £60 – a 33% saving.


For such anti-riches I can’t recommend any other tenkey-equipped, fully mechanical keyboard more; indeed, it held the ‘best cheap mechanical gaming keyboard’ title on our best keyboards list well before this discount revealed itself. The only thing missing here is USB pass-through, but N-key rollover, a volume dial, a detachable wrist rest, macro recording and RGB backlighting are all part of the deal. 


Sadly I haven’t found such a drastic saving for US buyers, though Amazon has sliced off a few dollars to bring it down to $75.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you enjoy carefully constructing a lineup of warriors in games like Darkest Dungeon or Monster Train, here's a surprising recommendation: play Super Auto Pets. The free-to-play auto-battler reminds me much more of those games than the likes of Dota Auto Chess or Teamfight Tactics, focused on building and arranging a line whose abilities will compliment each other. And for something so cute and simple-sounding, it has a delightful amount of buildcrafting. Even the F2P monetisation is good!

Even the least flammable foods turn to fiery ash as soon as I enter the kitchen. But that doesn’t matter because I have a virtual ace up my sleeve.

Given how big of an industry video games have become in the last 40 years, you'd think every other balloon in the show would feature a memorable Nintendo or Sony character hovering down the chilly street. Surprisingly, that's not the case, and only a handful of characters and games have had the honor to join in the festivities. We've collected them here in one place for you to gawk at, and have ranked them for your enjoyment.
Here are all of the video game balloons featured in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade over the years:

After eleasing the 2D Zelda-inspired Hyper Light Drifter in 2016 to critical acclaim, fans of the game clamored to see what was next and many were surprised to see something totally different. Solar Ash is bigger and bolder than Hyper Light Drifter in every way, from its switch to a fully 3D world to its new emphasis on high-speed traversal over combat-focused dungeon crawling. But what is Solar Ash? Heart Machine’s creative director, Alx Preston, took us through a tour of the game to discuss its origins, gameplay, and how he is coping with the fear of the sophomore slump.
In Preston’s words the “stupid elevator pitch” for Solar Ash is Super Mario Galaxy meets Shadow of the Colossus. Given that Solar Ash takes place in a beaut…]]></summary>

Therefore, finding a good one is imperative - especially for anyone spending long stints gaming while using said keyboard. Within the stellar range of gaming keyboards on offer, there are a few different types: ones with lights, mechanical, compact, wireless - I could go on. The beauty of Fnatic's offering is that it covers most bases, so you really can't go wrong with it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Katharine and I went hands-on with Babylon’s Fall last week, that online action RPG by PlatinumGames which falls in and out of memory as the years tick by. Still, when an invitation to the third phase of its ongoing closed beta test arrived, I couldn’t help but get excited. These are the folks behind NieR: Automata and Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance, after all, and now they’re making a live-service, co-op slasher. Sign. Me. Up.
As it stands, the closed beta only showed a very small, very early build of the game, but we’ve got some thoughts. Combat, exploration, and co-op were all on offer here, and there’s a fair amount to unpack. Look beyond the early build jank and there’s definitely potential.

Unfortunately, the launch of the compilation, which originally included Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary, Halo 2 Anniversary, Halo 3, and Halo 4, featured several problems surrounding the multiplayer suite and The Master Chief Collection seemed like it was well on its way to being one of the cautionary stories of unfulfilled potential within the games industry.
The disappointing launch, underwhelming feature set, and broken matchmaking could have been the way we look back on Halo: The Master Chief Collection in 2021, but developer 343 Industries wasn't satisfi…]]></summary>

Developers Complex Games have released a new dev diary talking about how his minions will bring plague across the land and, admittedly, it looks quite cool. But also: yuck!

Also tune in to learn about Matthew's new (and extremely one-sided) rivalry with an Olympic swimmer, a cavern of lies featuring bar tender Ed Harris, and a digression so self-indulgent we talk about how self-indulgent we are, and decide that it is a good thing.

Look outside the window and I see trees, maybe a little house nestled atop a hill. I walk past sheep and hope they don’t shuffle away from me this time, as it could mean we’re finally mates. At night it gets really dark, darker than you think is possible. An owl screeches and it scares the bejeezus out of me.
Yeah, it’s nice out here. But getting into the village by car is a challenge. The roads are wobbly and narrow, with little patience for noisy machines. This means I’ve had to stop and let other cars pass a lot. At first it was irritating, but now I’ve come to enjoy it. Getting a wave or a flash of the lights warms the heart and can turn a bad day into a good one. It strikes me that multiplayer games lack this fleeting comradery, which is a shame.

It has the gorgeous pixel art and presentation of a classic tycoon game, as well as all the simulation aspects you’d ever want. But buried under that business management exterior is a game equally interested in exploring moral choices, and one that leaves me thankful it pauses before I have to make a decision.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon Studios are "nearing a deal" to develop a TV series based on Mass Effect, according to a recent Deadline report. Excellent stuff. I'm all for it! If Mass Effect were to be adapted into anything, I'd much rather it be a potentially long-running series rather than a film so it has enough time to establish its excellent sci-fi setting. However, we need to talk about what story Amazon could potentially take from the games. To me, it seems likely they'd follow the trilogy, which I reckon is the right move. But I don't think we need to see more of Shepard's side of things, you know? They should put Liara front-and-centre instead.

And they've wiped out bugs including one which left players stuck downed, unable to respawn. Read on for more.

Even after some patches, these darn creepy crawlies aren’t shaken off so easily. These games are plagued by crashes, glitches, and general instability, to the point where playing them can be as fun as wading through a swarm of locusts.
Halo Infinite, though? The multiplayer component that had a bunch of flight tests? Pretty solid. Sure, a few bugs and matchmaking issues, but for the most part, it’s the most stable multiplayer FPS I’ve played this year. What was 343’s magic pesticide? Time. Simple as. Something Vanguard and Battlefield 2042 are only just catching up on.

Don't get me wrong, it's a decent amount to kickstart your VR library, but the credit voucher also has some niggly conditions attached to it that make it a lot less satisfying than a simple £50 / $50 discount off the regular headset price.

Sometimes it can be all too overwhelming to figure out what parts are good for a fast computer, but don't worry - we're here to help. 
WD - or, Western Digital - have been on a crusade to rival Samsung's computer bits for a while now, and may have finally achieved it with this SSD. In layman's terms, it will kick your computer into super speed, running games and operating system super fast and quick like. This particular SSD supports the PCle 4.0 standard, allowing for much faster read and write speeds than the older 3.0 interface. As Katharine found in her WD SN850 review, this drive is also both faster and cheaper than its big PCIe 4.0 rival, the Samsung 980 Pro.

The Fortnite and Unreal Engine overlords say that Harmonix "will collaborate closely with Epic to develop musical journeys and gameplay for Fortnite". The battle royale has seen some fancy musical performances, with elaborate in-game events to promote pop stars including Travis Scott and Ariana Grande, but hopefully Harmonix aren't consigned to advertising for eternity?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've always found it hard to get excited about the Men Of War series. This is admittedly partly down to the name. Short of outright calling your game "War", Men Of War is about as generic a title as you can get for a video game. And I think this was at least partly reflective of the games behind it. Men Of War has generally delivered dependable real-time tactics games, but the series has never excited me in the way that, say, Relic's Company Of Heroes does.
So it's a promising sign that, at the end of Best Way's demonstration of the just-announced Men Of War II, I came away keen to play it. Not only does it look slicker and more user friendly than earlier games (without compromising on the depth that appeals to the series' core fanbase) there are a couple of ideas it’s playing with that lodged themselves in my mind like chunks of grenade shrapnel.

Kojima Productions have confirmed no specific projects or plans yet. Even as someone who has a lot of time and enthusiasm for Kojima's self-serious wacky plots, I hope the plan isn't for anything as banal as a Death Stranding movie. Their video games are delightful because they're video games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Black Friday is weird. Partly because it’s not a Friday in any meaningful sense; what feels like a majority of deals start at least a fortnight in advance and continue well into the following week, an almost month-long commerce safari. The best Black Friday deals? Uncountable, not for lack of trying.


I have mixed feelings about it, clearly. I get why some people hate it. But I like having better computer stuff, and I like not having to spend as much money to get it. They’ve kind of got me over a barrel here. Still, while I’d never begrudge anyone climbing above the bottom layers of the ol’ Maslow’s hierarchy, it’s worth making sure that you’re only buying the things you want – not the things a big red “percentage figure off!” sticker makes you think you want. With that in mind, I asked around the RPS crew whether there’s anything specific they’re keeping an eye out for this Black Friday.

This slimline gaming laptop, complete with a 300Hz IPS display, is now only $1600 – close to half price, which is an even bigger deal when the MSRP is the same as a serviceable used car.

You know, Dream Daddy but Dream Detective or whatever.
Thing is, we've got Sexy Young Holmes and Sexy Young Poirot, sure, but two dudes don't make a dating sim, right? Why, ITV needs somewhere in the region of 35 fragile young adults to head-wreck every summer in Love Island. So who else would I need hot young versions of for my imaginary dating sim game?
