Being a farmer is a big job. You’ve got to water your fields, rotate your crops, and keep an eye on the market prices to make sure you’re able to pull a decent profit. If you’ve ever dreamed of trying your hand at this noble profession but don’t have hundreds of acres of land to play with, Farming Simulator 23: Nintendo Switch Edition is here to provide you with the realistic farming action that might be missing from games like Stardew Valley and Story of Seasons.
Simulator games are a tricky lot; they don’t necessarily need to have the best graphics, but they need to have a realistic feel when you’re behind the wheel of these machines. Farming Simulator 23 goes to a lot of effort to recreate farm equipment for you to ride around in. The tractors, tills, and plows all feel like something you might have been stuck behind while going down a country road. While we might not have driven them personally, most of us have seen them in action before and the vehicles in this game do a good job of replicating how they move and handle.

Hey friends, lovers, and well-wishers, (you are all of them), and welcome to Whatcha Been Playing? It's been a gnarly hectic week for The Industry's Chris Moyse, as I have had a lot on my plate over the course of the past two weeks. This is set to continue as we head into June (halfway through the year?!) and take on the myriad titles that are heading our way including Street Fighter 6, Diablo IV, and Final Fantasy XVI, not to mention that Summer Game Fest and Gamescom are also just around the corner.
What's that? A new Mortal Kombat launching this fall? And AEW in three weeks? Sure, why not?

Friday night before an extended holiday weekend is arguably the worst time for companies to release video game news.

This year marks the 25th anniversary of the Dragon Quest spin-off. The series is a monster-collecting take on the franchise, something developers had explored years earlier in Dragon Quest V.

By the time you're reading this, chances are Bungie developers will be hard at work at Destiny 2 headquarters trying to fix this rampant and easy-to-perform glitch, so let's get to it. There's a new method to easily acquire legendary shards in Destiny 2, and odds are it'll be gone before the weekend.
Want to get infinite shards in Destiny 2? Well, then this is what you have to do
Meet up with Ikora at The Tower, and take one of the exotic quests. Any will do the trick, so maybe get the first one.
Follow the quest steps until the fourth step. No more, no less.
Head back toward Ikora, talk to her, then get away from her without taking the armor.
Open the menu and chose to abandon the quest.
Talk to her again, and congrats, you'll now be able to take infinite pieces of exotic armor.
Now you just have to dismantle the exotic pieces of armor until you get tired of being rich or Bungie fixes the leaky golden fountain.
You'll get legendary shards each time you dismantle something, and you can keep doing it constantly. Youtuber Divide managed to blow this wide open, and you can watch their tutorial on how to use the glitch below:
https://youtu.be/x5KDoBoUh9Y
Bungie will surely make short work of this bug very soon, so we highly recommend you check out this sweet early summer gift as soon as you can.
[Update: Some players are reporting that there was a quick server-side fix that kicked them out of the game at roughly 6PM ET. If you're still in, you might be able to squeeze some shards in.]

If you’ve played the Ghosts 'n Goblins series, you probably know Red Arremer, even if the name doesn't ring a bell. The red gargoyle was a memorable addition to the classic arcade title, as their AI was extremely cruel. They would hover just outside of range, then swoop down at opportune moments to trip you up. At a time when most enemies did little more than move from right to left and maybe bounce if they were feeling sassy, Red Arremer stood out as a worthy (and vexing) foe.
You can scarcely tell by looking at it, but Demon’s Crest is the third in a series of Ghosts 'n Ghouls spin-offs that was originally titled Gargoyle’s Quest. So, after Gargoyle’s Quest 1 and 2, we got Demon’s Crest. I often complain about the bonkers nomenclature for the Ghosts 'n Goblins lo…]]></summary>

Other anime piracy sites are under the spotlight too, including some that appear to have no traffic at all.

Just over a year after leaving early access and fully releasing, Rogue Legacy 2 has received its final major update on consoles. The Swan Song update is now live on Nintendo Switch and Xbox platforms, about a month after the same content was made available for PC players via Steam.
The free and rather meaty new download features three new game modes, four new subclasses, and over 100 tweaks and bugfixes. Though this is expected to be the final content drop, Cellar Door Games intends to continue providing bugfixes and stability patches as needed.

The primary focus of FFXVI will be playing through Clive’s story and all it entails, but there’s more to the game than just the main scenario. 
I was curious about how players will get around Valisthea, especially with developer Creative Business Unit III at the helm. In its MMO, Final Fantasy XIV, mounts are abundant. You can ride chocobos, the Regalia from Final Fantasy XV, Magitek armor, and more. There are dozens of mounts to acquire in-game, and I wondered if that would bleed over into FFXVI.

Hero Concept has added a new vigilante to the street sweepin' roster of its comic-book scrapper, Mayhem Brawler — The Witchcraft update, now available for free on all platforms, brings with it a new mode, a fresh run of bug fixes, and an all-new hero in the form of Nora Komar, known to fans as the Alley Witch! This brings the playable roster to five characters in total. Neato!
A former boss character from Mayhem Brawler's story mode, Komar brings a delectable blend of urban fashionista and ancient, arcane attacks to the avenues and alleyways of Mayhem City. Offering some of the fastest attacks in the game, combined with a range of powerful ranged abilities, The Alley Witch brings a host of new combo routes and exciting new strategies to the team, not to mention some grade-A garbs. Let's get Alley Witch and She-Wolf together for a spot of face-bustin' action!

In addition to Korma's arrival. The Witchcraft upgrade also includes a new Boss Mayhem mode, which offers veteran players the chance to test their might against full rogues' gallery of boss characters, one after another. This was a feature that was utilized in many classic brawlers, such as Crime Fighters and Vendetta, and is thus something of a rite of passage for many examples in the genre.
Hero Concept has also taken the opportunity to rebalance various moves, player characters, and enemies, continuing its dedicated support of the Mayhem Brawler brand, which has received a litany of free new content since its initial release, including new moves, mechanics, modes, and three-player co-op action.
Mayhem Brawler is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Swicth platforms,

The DualSense is my favorite current-generation default controller. I am a huge fan of handheld gaming. By rights, Sony's just-announced Project Q, a handheld console that appears to have all the same features as the DualSense, should be right at the top of my hardware wishlist. And yet I feel no warmth towards that little machine at all.

That's because Project Q is not actually a handheld console. It's the latest and worst in a long line of "kinda handhelds," a trend that I feel pretty lukewarm towards that started with the Nintendo Switch. These are "handheld consoles" that primarily or exclusively exist to play home console games. They're neat. I love my Ni…]]></summary>

Join us today Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central as we kick of the adventure, which will continue each week until we roll credits. We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel (or you can watch the videos in the above playlist). 
Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.
Join me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey.

I’m not sure how to continue this article aside from just having a big ugly cry. In this case, I’ll just lean on quoting the press release while interjecting with sobbing.
https://twitter.com/ForeverEntert/status/1662112577113956355?s=20
“This decision was not taken lightly,” taunts the press release, “but in collaboration with the development team, we want to ensure that we have sufficient time to add as many functionalities as possible while proceeding with proper implementation and tests, in order to meet your expectations for a modern-day remake.”
Aaaaaanh! Haaanh haaanh! Whhhhy!?
Unable to provide us with an updated release date, the press release goes on to mock us by saying, “While we are currently unable to provide a specific revised premier date, we assure you that we are working tirelessly to complete the project as soon as possible, with the aim of releasing the game in the third quarter of this year.”
Take all the time you need to finish Front Mission 2: Remake
Ugh. Seriously, although I’m very excited to get my hands on Front Mission 2: Remake, I would definitely prefer that they take all the time they need to make sure it’s the finished package they want to release. My tears may soak my face right now, but one day they will dry. Once I’m united with the next in the series of Front Mission facelifts, all will be forgiven and forgotten. For now, I weep.
Front Mission 2: Remake is coming to Nintendo Switch. It is now aiming for a third-quarter 2023 release window.

While Guilty Gear has always been known for its complex and powerful characters, especially when compared to many other fighting games, somebody at Arc System Works may actually be taking this piss with the release of "That Man" Asuka R#, whose new Starter Guide reveals an arcane nightmare.
The progenitor of peace is certainly not living up to his reputation, stepping into the ring armed with an ancient tome of spells that provide myriad aggressive and defensive abilities, as well as keeping the opponent locked down in what is borderline abject terror, awaiting the next screen-filling mythic melee.
Where do you even fucking start?
Mana forms the backbone of most of Asuka R#'s attacks, and provides fuel for a range of spells that can be "bookmarked" and then released. In addition…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're also getting Rune Factory 6
The development teams at Marvelous are certainly keeping themselves busy. Multiple upcoming games were revealed in the developer's game showcase yesterday, including a new Daemon X Machina game and two new entries in the Story of Seasons franchise. Rune Factory is also doubling up in development as Series Director Shiro Maekawa revealed the company is diligently working on two new titles in the series, Rune Factory Project Dragon and Rune Factory 6.
Project Dragon seems to be the one further along in development, as Maekawa provided the first footage of this Rune Factory spin-off. The game is going with a Japanese-styled world as players will explore the "Land of the East" for the very first time. And it looks like they'll be able to do it while riding Tatsu dragons.
https://youtu.be/N4NGndJUuMY?t=1185
It feels like a lot of franchises have been looking to ancient Japan for inspiration over the past few years, from Monster Hunter Rise to the upcoming Disgaea 7: Vows of the Virtueless. To me, that's a good thing. I haven't been able to get enough of the setting since playing Ghost of Tsushima. What little video we see of the new game in the showcase certainly looks alright to me and I look forward to finding out more info (and whether or not the protagonist will have amnesia again.)
Beyond Project Dragon, Maekawa also confirmed Rune Factory 6 is in development. This game will feature a traditional western-fantasy setting on the continent of Adonea. I can only hope the end product is a few ticks above what we got with Rune Factory 5.
As with most of the games in the showcase, there is no information on a release date or potential launch platforms. In the meantime, Marvelous and Xseed Games will release Rune Factory 3 Special in September.

Information about the duo of figures is pretty limited at the moment, but we do have the following photos of each and we like what we see so far.

Most of everything is too long (songs, books, movies, everything) but it's especially felt in games, where the magical "What's next?" feeling of discovering a world often fades to leave the "What task must I complete now?" drudgery of playing a video game. So I hugely admire Cosmo D's Off-Peak series, which has built the feeling of a huge and fascinating city through only four tiny locations visited across four games with a combined playtime of under eight hours.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Because doing chores alone is dull
The Story of Seasons series continues to be the breadwinner for the developers at Marvelous, so it's never a surprise when there is one in development. During the Marvelous Game Showcase, we got our first look at the new Story of Seasons title. The theme of the game, according to series manager Hikaru Nakano, will be "Experiences." There wasn't much footage of it in the showcase, but what was there showed the team is working hard on its visuals. While I thought Story of Seasons: Pioneers of Olive Town looked just fine, I think the direction the team is going with the new game is sharp.
https://youtu.be/N4NGndJUuMY?t=892
Information on the new Story of Seasons is still scarce, but that didn't stop Nakano from announcing a future series entry during the stream. This also-unnamed Story of Seasons title is being developed around the theme of "a Story of Seasons you can play with everyone." As the series has mostly been a solitary experience throughout its life, it'll be interesting to see how Marvelous implements the concept. I have to wonder if the wild success of Animal Crossing: New Horizons, which made playing with friends easier than ever before, pushed Nakano in this direction.
If I had to put any money on it, I'd wager we'll be seeing more of the first new Story of Seasons game sometime in early 2024. I am curious about what platforms the game will release on as Nakano said it will "...reach more players than ever before." That sounds like code for a mobile game to me, but it could be a cross-platform experience along the lines of Genshin Impact.
As for the multiplayer entry, one can only guess when it'll release and for what platforms. Both games are "diligently under development," according to the showcase. If you can't wait that long, Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life releases next month.

Nintendo has released a small update for its blockbuster release The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. The new patch, which is available to download today, fixes a few issues that had been bothering some players on their adventures through the Sky Islands.
Unfortunately, as noted by Twitter user OatmealDome, Version 1.1.2 is mostly focused on eradicating Duplication glitches, with attempts to shutdown exploit bugs in which players could forge multiple versions of some of the title's top-tier weaponry. So it looks like the party's over for you multiple Master Sword wielders.
According to the official patch notes, available on the official Nintendo website, the update also fixes a strange, sporadic bug that would cause sound effects to randomly play at an extremely high volume. This has never happened to me but it sounds pretty funny. Additionally, the patch fixes a bug that caused players to become stuck during the mission "Camera Work in the Depths". This bug should be rectified.
Finally, the patch has addressed general issues to "improve the gameplay experience."
Don't ask questions I guess. Still, at least the sound of Ultrahand won't blow your eardrums anymore.
The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is available now on Nintendo Switch.

Here are the patch notes from Nintendo's website:
Ver. 1.1.2 (Released May 25, 2023)
Additional Fixes
Alongside fixing the audio issue and the Camera Work in the Depths quest, the "Several issues have been addressed to improve the gameplay experience," note is covering a lot of ground. It seems most if not all of the duplication glitches players discovered, which allowed them to duplicate rare items in the game with suprisingly little effort, have effectively been removed from the game, according to posters on the r/NintendoSwitch subreddit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kasting Kall
New Line continues to drip-feed kasting news for its upcoming movie sequel Mortal Kombat 2, announcing that British-Hong Kong actor Adeline Rudolph has bagged one of the film's most koveted roles, that of the Edenian princess, Kitana.
As noted in The Hollywood Reporter, Rudolph — who TV fans will recognize from streaming series such as Resident Evil, The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, and Riverdale — will don the mask and gather the fans of the hugely popular Mortal Kombat hero, daughter of Sindel and sister to the wicked Mileena. The casting sees Rudolph reunited with fellow Sabrina alumni Tati Gabrielle, who is expected to receive the role of Kitana's best friend and confidant, Jade. Rudolph seems a solid choice for Kitana, carrying the sly grace, strong presence, and timeless beauty of the deadly-but-honorable, noblewoman.
The success of New Line's original Mortal Kombat movie, directed by Simon McQuoid and starring martial arts actors Joe Taslim and Hiroyuki Sanada, has clearly allowed the new production to produce a sequel with a little more ambition and star power. The Boys' Karl Urban is tipped to play Tinseltown star Johnny Cage, and there are still all manner of potential roles to be filled, ahead of preliminary shooting this summer. McQuoid will return to direct, given his continued enthusiasm for the brand and project.
Mortal Kombat 2 is not to be confused with Mortal Kombat II. Nor is it the sequel to upcoming video game Mortal Kombat 1, nor the original 1995 Mortal Kombat movie.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The latest Pokémon Trading Card Game expansion, Scarlet & Violet – Paldea Evolved, arrives next month. As the name implies, this new version delivers plenty of evolved forms of Paldean Pokémon while expanding on the pre-existing catalog of Paldean and non-Paldean monsters.
This second expansion in the Scarlet & Violet series of cards brings with it more than 190 new cards, including 15 Pokémon ex cards, Tera Pokémon ex cards with a crystalline appearance, more than 30 Trainer cards, and dozens of Pokémon and Trainer cards with special illustrations. The Pokémon Company sent over several booster packs for us to open and see what we could pull, and those with the special illustrations ended up being the highlight of my pack-opening experience.
You can see my favorite of the cards I pulled in the gallery below.

I was pretty happy with the cards I pulled from the packs. My favorite is probably the special Elite Trainer Box Pikachu card, which features the three Paldean starters in the background, though I also love the Pikachu I pulled from a booster pack. Outside of that, I enjoyed seeing the various Paldean starters' evolved forms, though, for some reason, my pulls skewed heavily toward Quaxly's evolution line. Outside of this most recent generation of Pokémon, I was happy to snag some updated cards of old favorites, such as Gyarados, Raichu, and Tyranitar.
In addition to being the second Pokémon Trading Card Game to bear the Scarlet & Violet name, it's also the second pack to come at a higher price tag. However, The Pokémon Company has at least tried to deliver some benefits to this, as each pack includes more foils, and even the wrapper of each booster pack feels thicker and of higher quality than the original Scarlet & Violet expansion.
Pokémon Trading Card Game: Scarlet & Violet – Paldea Evolved arrives on June 9. For all things Pokémon Trading Card Game, head to our special hub by clicking the banner below!]]></summary>

The trouble with kart racers on Nintendo Switch is, well, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. It's the best one, and it's not close. The challenge for developers, then, is not to create clones, but instead to diversify. LEGO 2K Drive makes a valiant effort to set itself apart, making great use of its titular licence to provide players with a largely successful arcade racing experience. Unfortunately, while the core gameplay is fun, there are a couple of drawbacks that stop it from overtaking the competition.
The main attraction for most will be the game's Story mode. Here, you're introduced to Bricklandia, a plastic place inhabited by racing-obsessed Lego minifigures with silly names. Whether they're friend or foe, the cast is charming thanks to a surprisingly humorous script, capturing the chaotic tone of the movies and other games nicely. The tongue-in-cheek story is all about competing in races across Bricklandia's various regions to qualify for the Sky Cup Grand Prix.

Metal Gear fans went into overdrive during Wednesday's PlayStation showcase, when it was revealed that not only was the Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater remake a very real thing, but also that they'd be receiving a new opportunity to buy the old Metal Gear games for the 200th time via the all-new, all-old, Master Collection.
While the Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol.1 announcement included Metal Gear Solid, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, and the original Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, some mystery titles were also teased. However, thanks to a new listing on PlayStation Store itself, we now know that these titles are Hideo Kojima's original MSX classics Metal Gear and Metal Gear II: Solid Snake.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YDauj2Ayog&ab_channel=Konami
The set promises "classic versions" of all included titles, complete with additions such as the MGS: VR Missions/Special Missions, and the HD editions of MGS 2 and MGS 3. The listing also notes that some small edits will, unfortunately, be made or copyrighted content. This likely refers to some of the stock footage used in cutscenes throughout the Metal Gear Solid series. "Regional versions" of each game will also be available as alternate downloads — suggesting the addition of localized voice tracks and text.
Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol.1 will launch this fall on the "lastest platforms". Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is currently in development for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X.

As previously announced, Nintendo has brought three classics of the Game Boy Advance era to the Nintendo Switch Online archives. As of today, Expansion Pack subscribers can revisit the Super Mario Advance trilogy, consisting of Super Mario Advance (2001), Super Mario World: Super Mario Advance 2 (2001) and Yoshi’s Island: Super Mario Advance 3 (2002).
For those yet to experience these pint-sized classics, they are essentially revamped editions of some classic Super Mario Bros. titles, namely Super Mario Bros. 2, Super Mario World, and Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island. They feature all of the worlds, stages, and shenanigans of their original releases, complete with additional features, characters, and secrets. Upon launch, they were the first-ever official portable option for these classic adventures, and as such were incredibly popular GBA releases.

The fourth title in the series, Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3, is already available as part of the Nintendo Switch Online archives, having arrived alongside the service's debut back in the fall of 2018. All four titles are most assuredly worth a revisit, and it's cool to have the quartet of classics available to hand as some of the most timeless releases in platform gaming history.
The Super Mario Advance series is now available to play for all Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers.

The 2023 Summer of Streams™ kicked off yesterday with a bang (or was it a whimper) with the Sony presentation that highlighted some hotly anticipated games and reminded this writer that Dragon's Dogma II was actually in development. There were some highlights to the show, but the only stream I've been focused on this year is the Marvelous Game Showcase. Marvelous and Xseed Games are one of my favorite developer/publisher combos out there, so when they have new games to announce, I pay attention. And I'm glad I was paying attention to the stream today because Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion capped off the showcase.
https://youtu.be/N4NGndJUuMY?t=1693
Okay, so it's one of those terrible pre-rendered teaser trailers that I usually make fun of. But at least this game is happening. And why shouldn't it? According to Marvelous, Daemon X Machina sold "very well" on Nintendo Switch. While work on a sequel was confirmed back in 2021, the Marvelous Game Showcase was our first sorta-look at the title. A supplementary email that was sent out after the presentation didn't provide any extra information other than to say more details will be made available at a later date.
If you've never heard of Daemon X Machina, the game is a wonderful experimental mech action game with outstanding gameplay bookended by a story you'll likely forget about the moment you set down the controller. Even if it wasn't my favorite game of 2019, it was one I came back to often because I could always rely on it for a good time.
Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion is now in development at Marvelous First Studio.

THQ Nordic and Pieces Interactive have locked in a date for their remake, or reimagining, of Alone in the Dark. The return to Derceto Manor will arrive on October 25, 2023 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.
Announced during a spotlight on the game, Alone in the Dark will go for $59.99. And if you want to check it out before you put that cash down, there's also a free playable prologue going live tonight. It's up on Steam, PlayStation, and Xbox.
THQ Nordic says that this prologue doesn't have spoilers for the main story, but will let you experience what this reimagining of an old classic has to offer.

Star power
Additionally, THQ Nordic has announced that Alone in the Dark will feature two recognizable likenesses for its leads. Pieces Interactive is working with David Harbour (Stranger Things) and Jodie Comer (Killing Eve) for their portrayals of Edward Carnby and Emily Hartwood, respectively.
The actors are lending their voice, appearance, and acting to the protagonists. Each is a selectable character, and depending on who you play as, you'll get a different view of the Alone in the Dark story. And this marks another game crossover for Harbour, who's also set to star in the upcoming Gran Turismo movie. They aren't directly connected, but in my own head-canon, I like to think they are.
For those who like a little bit of scares around the Halloween season, October is starting to look stacked. Alongside Alone in the Dark, we also recently got an October release date for Alan Wake 2.
As for Alone in the Dark, this reboot of the Infogrames classic certainly has a long legacy to live up to. The team is calling it a love letter to the '90s classic, so we'll see if it captures the magic again in October.

Before Resident Evil and Silent Hill, 1992’s Alone in the Dark helped lay the foundation for 3D survival horror before the genre even had a name. Players explored a haunted building laden with elaborate puzzles and scary monsters, with gameplay emphasizing thoughtful management of scarce resources. It even featured two playable characters with separate scenarios, an idea later adopted by Resident Evil 2. Numerous sequels of varying quality followed, but it’s been many years since the series was culturally relevant.

Homeworld's newest venture is getting pushed out of this year. Gearbox Publishing and Blackbird Interactive have delayed Homeworld 3 out of 2023, and into February 2024.
Previously set for the "first half" of 2023, the team behind the new Homeworld is taking a little more time for development. Today's statement specifically cites time for polishing up  this new entry.
"Our primary goal is to deliver a Homeworld experience that lives up to the standards set by its predecessors and is worth of this series' incredible legacy," reads today's statement. "Homeworld 3 is shaping up to be exactly that, but in order to fully realize that vision we need more time to refine and polish the game."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I hope someone gets my references
Purveyor of good graphics, Videlectrix, has announced that Dangeresque: The Roomisode Triungulate is coming to PC via Steam and Itch.io.
For those of you who aren't cool enough to know, Dangeresque, the eponymous sometimes private eye, is a character played by Strong Bad, a prominent figure in the ‘00s-era web cartoon, Homestar Runner. Dangeresque: The Roomisode was a spin-off Flash game that combines this weird no-budget concept with LucasArts adventure games. It was called this because it consisted entirely of trying to get out of one room.
https://twitter.com/StrongBadActual/status/1661803493366136849?s=20
Dangeresque: The Roomisode Triungulate is a continuation of this concept… maybe? It will involve three roomisodes, otherwise known as a Triungulate. It will also include cutscenes and full voice acting.
Homestar Runner sort of fizzled out around the time the internet was becoming far less interesting. However, it never completely went away. New cartoons and other projects keep coming out sporadically from the creators, the Brothers Chapman. Notably, every so often, Strong Bad will play an old game in his Youtube series, Disk 4 of 12.
Homestar Runner was a huge part of my life for most of its heyday. It sucked me in as a teenager, and it helped inform the development of my sense of humor. I still subscribe to some of the Brothers Chapman’s approach to wordplay in my writing. I’m hoping that Dangeresque: The Roomisode Triungulate is a sign that we’re going to get a remake of Strong Bad’s Cool Game for Attractive People. I’m looking at you, Skunkape Games.
Dangeresque: The Roomisode Triungulate is coming to PC via Steam and Itch.io. No release date is given, nor if it will be of the money-cost variety.

Here, Clive meets Cidolfus Telamon, or Cid for short – because this is Final Fantasy, after all. Shortly after, Cid brings Clive to a place dubbed Cid’s hideaway. 
This hideaway is one of the main hubs in FFXVI. While I’m not sure of its location in Valisthea, the continent where the game takes place, it looks built into a cavernous structure. It features a pub where you speak with locals about what’s going on in the world, side quests to pick up, and a music player, as well.

After playing Warhammer 40000: Boltgun, I certainly feel like I need a high-pressure blast of water. That game is one of the bloodier first-person shooters out there. There are definitely some floors out there that need a good hose-down, which is to say nothing of the armor that probably stinks of rot and heresy.

Unfortunately, right now, we only have a teaser to go off of. I’m taking a guess here, but we’re probably not just going to be cleaning the logo off. Although, if we were, I’d appreciate the brazen approach to crossover advertising.
Is it Warhammer 40000’s birthday? No? I’ve just suddenly been getting hit by all these Warhammer 40000 press releases this morning in particular. Maybe it’s just because I reviewed Boltgun, and now I’m on a list somewhere. Or maybe it’s just like when you learn the word “expectorate,” and suddenly you start hearing it everywhere. The Baader–Meinhof phenomenon. Internalize that term, you’re about to notice it a lot more.
PowerWash Simulator is available for PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, PS4, PS5, and Switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2023 has seen the closure of more big multiplayer games than, well, any time I can recall in recent memory. One after the other, developers' dreams of making the next big Destiny-like have gradually collapsed in on themselves. Like a deflated concertina, their last honks of life have been crushed down to desperate, fizzling squeals as servers lie empty and the cost of maintaining them spirals out of control. Some are still hanging in there, sure, but the genre as a whole feels like it's at a tipping point - and I couldn't help but sigh as five more multiplayer shooters joined the fray last night as part of Sony's PlayStation Showcase.

Through the last two weeks, players have been sharing wild contraptions in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. We've seen giant mechs, armored carriers, flaming robo-willies, and everything in-between. But as much as we like the elaborate constructions, we also love the practical builds that get us where we need to go. Like, for example. a three-piece hoverbike that's been quite popular in Tears of the Kingdom.
Finding the first person to build and spread something like this around can be difficult, as Tears of the Kingdom TikTok has multiple videos about builds like the hoverbike. I've seen this particular build crop up in a few places, across different social forums and media. But a particularly good explainer comes from 2uncle2dane (a.k.a. Uncle Dane) on YouTub…]]></summary>

It was back in Eiji Aonuma's 10-minute gameplay demonstration for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom that we first got a glimpse at the possibilities of shield fusing. The series producer took a Puffshroom, stuck it to Link's shield, and faced a Construct head on, sending up a cloud of smoke around them both.
At the time, this was hardly a game-changing revelation. "Great," we thought, "we can make some weird-looking shields and take on foes with various mushroom abilities". Then the game came out and we discovered that shield fusing had the potential to be so much more than just some fungal fun.

Developed internally at Frontier, it promises to be a modern take on the classic RTS, giving you four unique factions to play with, including the Stormcast Eternals and Orruk Kruleboyz, across a single player campaign and 1v1 and 2v2 competitive multiplayer modes. I got to see a little bit of an alpha build of Realms Of Ruin in action ahead of tonight's Skulls stream, and if you're a fan of tabletop miniatures, this is definitely an RTS you'll want to keep an eye on, as Frontier have gone all out on making this look as close to Age Of Sigmar's TT origins as they can. Here's what you need to know.

Oh, also fan-favourite character Cayde-6 is back, voiced again by Nathan Fillion. But you need to see this big triangle.

It isn’t very good, though, rapidly becoming one of the worst-reviewed games to have launched this year—and we’re only halfway through 2023. One particular aspect that’s being singled out for derision is…

And if its combat reminds you of DMC, it’s probably because the combat director of FFXVI is Ryota Suzuki, who helped design combat on Devil May Cry 4 and Devil May Cry 5. But he also worked on Marvel Vs. Capcom 2. 
While the DMC inspirations laced within FFXVI’s combat are hard to miss, Suzuki told me that Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 inspired some of FFXVI's systems as well. 
“There’s actually something from Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 that we took and put into Final Fantasy XVI, and that is, as you may or may not know, in Marvel Vs. Capcom 2, we had the Assist system where you could give orders to your partner in battle,” Suzuki says. “And by impl…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No more technical fixes yet
Pokemon has been having...issues lately. Amid the last-second delay of Pokemon Home, and problems with recent raid events, another bug popped up that dealt with private tournaments. Well, the latter just got fixed, at least! This info comes from the official Japanese Pokemon account, which tweeted out the update details this week:
"Updated data (Ver.1.3.1) for 'Pokemon Scarlet Violet' has been distributed. Fixed an issue where unintended behavior occurred in private official tournaments where specific users were invited. We have sent an email to all contestants who were affected."

When will the big bug and performance patch come for Scarlet & Violet
As you can glean from the super small patch notes, this is a minor update that brings the game out of the 1.3.0 era and into 1.3.1. We're still waiting for that big performance patch, but let's face it: it may never come, or it might not be sufficient enough to warrant its existence.
In the world of Pokemon, you never quite know what you're going to get with any given release. It's the curse of Game Freak (combined with short production schedules), and it's impacted them ever since bringing the series off of pure handhelds and into the console era of Pokemon.

Captain's Log: Star Trek Resurgence succeeds at telling a gripping story, like many episodes of the long-running series.

You'll make impactful decisions, solve mysteries, and truly think on your feet.

        <updated>2023-05-25T12:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atari and developer Sneakybox have announced Days of Doom, an apocalyptic turn-based tactical roguelite. The game hopes to subvert the expectations of those who are tired of the brown and gray color palettes of other apocalypse settings by placing the action over vibrant and colorful backdrops as you battle through hordes of zombies, raiders, and mutant lizards. 
Navigating the wasteland to reach a sanctuary will require strategy, as you must combat the encroaching mutated forces using your group of distinct survivors. Beyond the turn-based tactics at play, you must also manage your scarce collection of resources and keep your wits about you as you maneuver through the hordes of the undead.

Each of the eight survivor classes features unique abilities that can be used to shift your fortunes in battle. For example, the Pyro class allows you to burn enemies and leave them with residual damage each turn while combining the Hydromancer with the Thrasher can drench enemies with water before electrocuting them for a devastating synergy. Players will need to use these abilities to their advantage and think strategically with these abilities to overcome the seemingly insurmountable odds.
And, of course, with it being a roguelite game, players can expect each run to feel unique. More than 50 randomly occurring events present risk-reward scenarios for players during their runs, while more than 70 collectible items and runes can help you turn the odds in your favor in your given run. However, as you play several runs and make progress, you unlock permanent upgrades, such as party size increases and resource accumulation speed.
If you'd like to learn more, you can check out the reveal trailer below.


Days of Doom arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, PC, and Atari VCS later this year.]]></summary>

Hence why Phantom Blade Zero has perked me up to no end, as it's an action RPG announced at last night's PlayStation Showcase which marries Chinese martial arts with a steampunk aesthetic. I'm on board, if cautious! The action seems rad, but it's so fast, it's hard to tell how it actually plays.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Along with confirming a shiny remake of Metal Gear Solid 3 at last night's PlayStation Showcase, Konami announced a collection of ye olde Metal Gears Solid 1-3. These sound like straightforward rereleases of the classic stealth games and I'm cool with that because I am deeply wary of Konami touching Metal Gear at all. I just want Snake Eater on PC at long last. Konami are vague about platforms, but I'm expecting/hoping we'll see this collection on PC? And more vintage Gears Solid might follow.

The remake was originally supposed to come out four months after its reveal in 2021, tripped into 2022, and was then delayed indefinitely after switching developers. Essentially, this sounds like a Benjamin Button situation.

In fact, I’ve had about as much fun with it as I would on a spa day in the Barad-dûr sulfur pits. Between the soulless platforming, undercooked stealth, tedious storytelling, and framerate stuttering so bad it’s got me killed twice, Gollum is perilously short on likeable qualities. Especially if you’re not into LOTR lore, or fine hattery.
In my unclad head, then, Gollum’s highlight so far has been DLSS 3. It’s one of just a few dozen games to support the newest, most artificially intelligent version of Nvidia’s deep learning-powered upscaler, and frankly makes a very compelling argument for switching it on. Graphics card allowing, obviously.

Sony hosted its 2023 PlayStation Showcase today, spotlighting what's to come for the platform in the future. Both first and third-party games were shown off, some set for the near future, and others still a ways off.
It was an interesting showcase, all things considered. The third-party developers were pretty varied and interesting; seeing labels like Finji up alongside the likes of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is a treat, and there were a few surprises, like the next project from the Gris team.
Still, some of the heavy hitters were known quantities, like Street Fighter 6 or Final Fantasy XVI, or reveals that seem fairly far-off, like Bungie's revival of Marathon. Even though the Spidey gameplay reveal was admittedly rad, it was strange to not see a date at the end.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s PlayStation Showcase saw Square Enix unveil a squeaky-clean online shooter called Foamstars. 
This wacky new multiplayer shooter pits two teams of four against each other using weapons that shoot, you guessed it, foam. Battlefields are covered in soapy foam, which players can use to their advantage by creating slippery surfaces to slide at high speeds. Foam can also be used in other ways, such as to shield yourself and your teammates from attacks or create vantage points. The trailer shows off a bunch of goofy weapons and the game pretty much feels like the anti-thesis of Splatoon. 


Square Enix promises to share more about Foamstars in the future, but it’s coming to PlayStation 5 and 4.]]></summary>

The action jumps to six months later in Queens, as a black-suited Peter Parker bursts from a basement to battle some of the Hunter’s goons. The gameplay sequence that follows is impressive, showing off Spider-Man’s new symbiote abilities, which allow for an array of tenta…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The 2020 first-person action title Ghostrunner has garnered a strong community of fans thanks to its precise controls and high-octane action. Perhaps that's why, less than a year following its initial PC release, a sequel was announced. However, outside of some concept art, we haven't seen or heard much from developer One More Level or publisher 505 Games.
However, that changed today, as the studio released a first gameplay look for the highly anticipated sequel. Revealed during today's PlayStation Showcase, the trailer shows the game's cyber-ninja protagonist, Jack, participating in the series' trademark fast-paced, always-forward combat and traversal. According to the team, the sequel looks to elevate the formula in every category, including the addition of vehicular combat.
You can see the trailer for yourself below.


Ghostrunner 2 arrives later this year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bungie is best known as the team behind Halo and Destiny, but it's digging through the crates of its past to bring back one of its original successes, Marathon.
Marathon was first released for the Apple Macintosh in 1994 and was a first-person shooter centering on a space-faring security cop fighting to stop an alien invasion. It was followed by two sequels, with the third entry arriving in 1996. This new Marathon sports a distinctly vibrant look and will also be a first-person shooter, but is a PvP extraction-style experience. Players control a runner in order to, according to the game's website, "compete for survival, riches, and renown in a world of evolving, persistent zones, where any run can lead to greatness."


The game's website also has the following synopsis:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the biggest 2023 PlayStation Showcase announcements was a confirmation of the long-rumored remake of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. At the tail end of that announcement, however, was another exciting, admittedly smaller announcement that the first three Metal Gear Solid games will be ported to PlayStation 5 in one presumed package.
The single image above appeared at the end of the Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater remake teaser with the words, "Sneak back into the original games on PlayStation 5," with an autumn 2023 release window. The package is called Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Volume 1, which implies more Metal Gears may be on the way. A Volume 2 could, hopefully, finally free Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots from its PlayStation 3 prison – the only platform that game has ever been made available on.
Update: According to the game's listing on the PlayStation Store, the package will also include the original Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake. Here is how the the listing of included games is worded on page.

Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft showed off a new look at Assassin’s Creed Mirage at today's PlayStation Showcase. The trailer shows protagonist Basim as he leaps, slides, and fights his way across the ancient streets of Baghdad.
Basim was introduced to Assassin’s Creed players in the earlier release of Valhalla, but this new game jumps back to an earlier time in the character’s life.


The action on display looks slick and modern but strongly calls to mind the flow of gameplay that longtime players may recall from early games in the series, controlling the likes of Altair and Ezio as they moved through large urban cityscapes. The new combat system, in particular, features some especially impressive animations and combat moves. The trailer also suggests that players will have a number of choices in how to approach a given mission, with clear decisions outlined in pre-mission briefings and then the chance to execute on a chosen plan.
Assassin’s Creed Mirage is targeting release on October 12 for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The rumors were true. Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater is getting remade for PlayStation 5 and Xbox. 
The remake is officially called Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater. A cinematic teaser showcased a jungle filled with dangerous animals vying for dominance, with Naked Snake emerging from the depth of a bog to show off his remade look. Originally released in 2004, the title is a 1960s-era prequel to the Metal Gear series that tells the origin story of Big Boss and lays the groundwork for the entire Metal Gear fiction. 


Unfortunately, we don't get to see gameplay, and the title doesn’t have a release window, but the first three Metal Gear Solid games are also being bundled in a collection heading to PlayStation 5 this fall. What do you think of this first look at Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alan Wake 2 had an appearance today during the PlayStation Showcase event. And as you might've guessed, the trailer left a lot of questions. But it did answer an all-important one: when the game is coming out. 


Here's what we gathered: Alan is trapped ... somewhere. According to him, he has to write to escape. Ostensibly, that's from the cult members chasing and attacking seemingly everyone within a 50-mile radius. Alan is writing about the police investigation into the death of Robert Nightingale, one of the antagonists of the first game. Here, the trailer splits into multiple perspectives: that of Alan and that of two investigators (one of which is voiced by James McCaffrey, of Max Payne fame, which Remedy also developed). Notably, we see that we'll play at least two different characters in Alan Wake 2: Alan, of course, but then also one of the investigators, a young woman named Saga Anderson. 
The trailer closes with the game's release date: October 17, 2023. 
Alan Wake 2 was originally announced back at The Game Awards 2021 via a cinematic trailer. This is the first time we've seen the game in action.]]></summary>

The admittedly early footage from the game shows a character rebuilding a town, gliding through the air on a paraglider, riding and fighting strange creatures, and collecting resources. The trailer also showed flying whales in the sky.


Towers Of Aghasba comes from Dreamlit and appears to be taking ample inspiration from Breath of the Wild and should be arriving next year.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s PlayStation Showcase brought the reveal of Sword of the Sea, a new game from Giant Squid, the development team behind Abzu and The Pathless.
The most striking visuals of the new game come from a vast desert that brings to mind thatgamecompany’s Journey. That’s not coincidence, since Giant Squid’s founder is Matt Nava, who was previously art director at thatgamecompany. But while this new game is destined to draw strong comparisons to that classic title, there were some notable differences on display. First, the desert itself looks much more like a flowing sea, and the character you control like a surfer moving through the water. In certain sequences, the desert seems to actually transform into water, suggesting a mystery at the core of the game.
In the footage shown, we see a focus on flow movement for the protagonist as they ride across the sand and trick off of half-pipes. From surrounding descriptions about the game, we know that you control a character named the Wraith, who was brought back to life to restore life to a ruined world, while facing off against vast leviathans that attempt to block progress.
Sword of the Sea is coming to PS5, but no word yet on a release date.]]></summary>

A humorous trailer showed off the game’s sci-fi action and sense of humor.

You'll team up with up to four friends to blast apart scores of extraterrestrial threats using a variety of high-tech weaponry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Phantom Blade 0, a new entry in the Phantom Blade series, was announced today during the most recent PlayStation Showcase via a cinematic and gameplay trailer. 
While it was hard to ascertain specifics from the trailer, we did get glimpses at the game's action RPG combat, which is fast, frenetic, and stylish. According to a YouTube description, Phantom Blade 0 is inspired by Chinese martial arts and steampunk. In it, you play as the Dark Raider, out for revenge against "The Order." Additionally, the voiceover twice asks a disembodied character what they will do with what little time they have left. Specifically, 66 days. Their response is to get their heart back.
Check out the trailer below:


No release information was given.
Phantom Blade 0 is being developed by Cruel Man Studio, based in Kowloon Bay, Hong Kong. The studio was founded in 2019, and thus far, has worked with Tencent and Square Enix.]]></summary>

I spend about 20 minutes checking out every nook and cranny of one of the earlier open field locations in the game. After that, I check my map to see how much I had covered in the area I was permitted to explore – it was about an eighth, which is to say these zones are massive.

Mere minutes after Nvidia hit the launch button on the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti, AMD rocked up with a new 1080p graphics card of their own: the Radeon RX 7600. Though it’s likely more of an RTX 4060 rival, given the RX 7600 will go on sale tomorrow – May 25th – at £260 / $269, slightly less than the $299-tagged 4060.
Based on the same RDNA 3 architecture as the Radeon RX 7900 XT and RX 7900 XTX, the RX 7600 nonetheless targets a much more widely-used monitor resolution than those 4K-minded GPU hulks. Which makes a nice change, and means AMD will beat Nvidia’s RTX 40 series to the punch on a sub-£300 GPU, with the RTX 4060 not set for release until July.

Specifically, and perhaps critically, I learned that the team was inspired by the first four seasons of Game of Thrones. Or at least, that’s where it started. 
“Right around the start of the game’s development back when we’re in that early period is right about when [Season 4 of Game of Thrones on HBO] was airing,” FFXVI producer Naoki Yoshida tells me. “We had seen it grow into this television show that was loved around the world, not just by older generations but younger generations as well. So we bought the Blu-Ray box of Seasons 1, 2, 3, and 4, and made everyone on the team watch it …]]></summary>

Strangers decorate their houses with mini slopes and sliding paths, they record their marbles rolling down these elaborate courses, and then they’re posted online for strangers like me to mindlessly enjoy. I’ve now spent the last few nights building my own marble runs - not in real life, because I’m too lazy for the cleanup after - in Zen Marbles, a free playable prototype, out now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m sure you’re all bored of reading about how about how expensive RTX 40 series graphics cards are; I’m certainly bored of writing about it. Thank the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti for its mercy, then – assuming you can find one at RRP,  it’s the first of its family not to plonk a price premium over the last-gen equivalent. And even though it’s only moderately faster than the RTX 3060 Ti in most games, its efficiency improvements and DLSS 3 support ensure the RTX 4060 Ti keeps some crowd pleasing potential.

One of the highlighted issues is a lack of pirate site blocking, which is seen as an effective enforcement measure. Interestingly, the EU doesn't mention the United States, which is arguably the most significant country yet to implement an effective site-blocking regime.

Oh I was tempted! But now Season Of The Deep started yesterday and Titan is here and no, it's not enough.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Swedish developers The Bearded Ladies certainly have a type. If you’ve played the memorably odd Mutant Year Zero or the largely forgettable Corruption 2029, you’ll know it by now – a blend of real-time stealth and turn-based tactics, where you quietly pick off stragglers from enemy squads before confronting the rest in a team scrap. Now here’s Miasma Chronicles, the Ladies’ third effort, and let’s just say they’re clearly happy to stick with what they know.
While the patterns of play are to a great extent the same, though, Miasma Chronicles is a more ambitious project. Addressing criticisms that those earlier games weren’t substantial enough, it’s a broader, denser beast, in which you could easily spend twice as long – 30 hours or so – seeing all the sights and shooting the nasties that populate them. That means there’s a lot more space available for this game to coax out varied strategies and introduce more elements, which is great. But it also means the weaker elements of the formula are left more exposed, which isn’t.

Mortal Kombat 1 is the first entry of the new timeline following the events of Mortal Kombat 11. So far, all we know about its gameplay are Kameo Fighters, a new feature described by NetherRealm Studios as a unique roster of partner fighters that aid players during matches. It feels all but confirmed that we'll see this mechanic in action at SGF alongside the game's other bells and whistles ahead of its September 19 launch. 
Summer Game Fest is the biggest event happening in June, but it's far from the only video game showcase on the horizon. You can keep track of every big livestream taking place around it by checking out our June Summer Game Fest streaming schedule.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Marvel's Spider-Man 2 was announced in September 2021, it showed off various elements that got players frothing at the mouth for the sequel to one of the greatest superhero games of all time. While seeing Venom emerge from the shadows was extremely exciting, the bulk of the trailer showcased Peter Parker and Miles Morales working side by side to take down several goons in the streets of New York.
That in itself was merely an eyebrow-raising affair, but it's hardly confirmation of cooperative play. However, when Miles Morales voice actor Nadji Jeter responded to a SacAnime panel question about whether or not Spider-Man 2 is a co-op game or not with, "I don't know if it's been announced or not, but I think so," that added fuel to the fire. 
Yesterday, when a Twitter user asked if the speculation and rumors were true, Insomniac Games unexpectedly jumped in to clear the air. "Nope! It is an epic single-player adventure!," the tweet from the official Insomniac Games account said. This seems to fully debunk the speculation from fans and comments from Jeter, and that Marvel's Spider-Man 2 will follow in the footsteps of Marvel's Spider-Man and Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales in being a fully single-player experience.
Nope! It is an epic single-player adventure!
May 22, 2023
This isn't the first time a Spider-Man 2 voice actor has seemingly confirmed details about the game without the permission of the studio or PR team. Back in March, Venom voice actor Tony Todd announced to the world through his Twitter account that Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is expected to launch in September of this year, with commercials starting to appear in August. While we are still waiting to see if that pans out better than Jeter's comments about co-op, Todd has since deleted the original tweet. 
With a PlayStation Showcase set to air tomorrow, we might not have long to wait to learn more. For now, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is set to arrive on PlayStation 5 later this year.

Titles like Hyrule Warriors, Link's Crossbow Training, Cadence of Hyrule, and the CD-i games are left off. Even with those missing, we still have 21 games where Link battles the forces of evil to save Zelda, Hyrule, or whatever equivalent exists in that respective game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since the reveal of Final Fantasy XVI, players have asked about a potential PC version of the game, especially given that the PlayStation 5-exclusivity reveal came with a six-month window. Some potential players have assumed when that window is up, a PC version of FFXVI will be released. 
During my FFXVI cover story trip to Square Enix’s Tokyo, Japan, office, I asked producer Naoki Yoshida about a PC version of the game. While it sounds like it’s on the way, he stresses that it will be longer than six months before players see or even possibly hear about it. I’m guessing he mentions six months because of the aforementioned exclusivity window, but he reiterates that this window expiring does not mean the PC version of FFXVI will go live then or anytime soon. 
So for now, and presumably quite a while after the game’s release, if you want to play FFXVI, you’ll need a PlayStation 5.

With the former, CBUIII gets to create settings and characters they can easily return to in future patch quests, expansions, and more. But theoretically, that’s not the case with the latter – Clive Rosfield’s story wraps up in Final Fantasy XVI. 
And right now, that indeed could be the end of Clive and the rest of Valisthea’s story because currently, CBUIII has no plans for FFXVI DLC, according to director Hiroshi Takai. He and producer Naoki Yoshida say the team’s priority is getting the ga…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun is possibly one of the most perfectly named games in history. The first bit lets you know you’re playing a game set in the venerable Warhammer 40,000 tabletop universe, while the second bit tells you everything else you need to know. What kind of game is it? Boltgun. What’s the gameplay like? Boltgun! What’s the story? BOLTGUN! Okay, there is technically a story, but it’s a thin excuse to let you shoot crunchy Chaos things in 40k, and shooting things in 40k means BOLTGUN!!!
Boltgun is a retro-styled first-person shooter, or boomer shooter, to use the parlance of our times. Cast as a Space Marine, one of 40k’s genetically engineered fascist super soldiers, it’s your job to secure the Plot Device and prevent 40k’s already crappy Imperium from getting even crappier. As you can probably guess, this means running around at incredible speeds and shooting hordes of cultists, traitors and daemons in the face until they fall down, explode into chunks of bright red gore, or both.

As a development team, the members of Piccolo Studio have an apparent interest in artistic interactive representations of uncomfortable realities. Their previous project, Arise: A Simple Story, was an affecting and powerful portrayal of death and heartbreak. After Us has broader ambitions, telling an allegorical tale about life after humanity and the complicated and often-devastating relationship we have always had with nature. The conclusions it leaves to the player to draw on those subjects are thematically heavy-handed but still imp…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse set to arrive in theaters in just over a week, it should come as no surprise that Fortnite is adding some items and costumes to the most expansive IP crossover in gaming history. As teased yesterday, Miles Morales and Miguel O'Hara (AKA Spider-Man 2099) are joining Fortnite in promotion of the highly anticipated film.
The new additions, which include reskinned Spider-Man's Web-Shooters – now called Spider-Verse Web-Shooters – and two new Outfits, accompany Spider-Man themed Week 11 Quests. Epic Games teases that the Web-Shooters, in particular, will come in handy in those Quests. While most of those Quests award XP, one will give you the "Silk & Cologne (EI8HT version)" lobby track from Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.
If this sounds up your alley, you can find the Spider-Verse Web-Shooters on the ground or by exchanging bars for them from Spider-Gwen. You can also find the Spider-Man (Miles Morales) Outfit, which includes the masked Earth 1610 alt style and the Spider-Verse Portal Back Bling, as well as the Spider-Man 2099 Outfit, which includes the 2099 Web Cape Back Bling, in the Item Shop. These items, along with other accessories, can be purchased as part of the Across the Spider-Verse Bundle. That bundle includes the Mega City Swing Loading Screen.
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse arrives in theaters on June 2.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When it was announced in February, Samba de Amigo: Party Central excited many who look back on the 2000 Dreamcast/Arcade title with a nostalgic fondness. The rhythm game, which tasks players with shaking maracas to the beat of popular songs, finally has a concrete release date. Players can expect to transform their Joy-Cons into maracas when the Switch-exclusive title launches on August 29. 
Samba de Amigo: Party Central's launch soundtrack already features 40 popular tracks from artists like Ariana Grande, Kesha, Nicki Minaj, and Carly Rae Jepsen, as well as some tracks from Sonic Adventure 2 and Sonic Forces. While "City Escape" and "Fist Bump" from those games are a part of the launch lineup, fans of Sega's lineup of games can anticipate even more content from Sonic, as well as other Sega franchises, through downloadable content.
The Sonic Music DLC Pack includes "Open Your Heart" from Sonic Adventure, "Reach for the Stars" from Sonic Colors: Ultimate, and "I'm Here" from Sonic Frontiers. The Sega Music DLC Pack includes "Bakamitai (Taxi Driver Edition)" from the Yakuza series, "Go Go Cheer Girl!" from Space Channel 5: Part 2, and "Rhythm Thief Theme" from "Rhythm Thief & the Emperor's Treasure.
All of these DLC tracks are included as part of the Digital Deluxe Edition, which will be available on the Nintendo eShop for $50. The Digital Deluxe version also includes special costumes for Sonic, Tails, Space Channel 5, Super Monkey Ball, and Puyo Puyo, further hammering home the Sega theme in this game. The standard edition costs $40.
Samba de Amigo: Party Central arrives on Switch on August 29. For more on the game, check out our coverage of the announcement and see the first trailer here.]]></summary>

"It's not you, it's me", rings true here, as it's definitely not the fault of the video games. I trust that Phoenix Wright or Paranormasight are brilliant, but the sudden act of having to read lots in a game has never worked out for me.
Then Citizen Sleeper came along for this month's RPS Game Club - and I think I'm a changed man? I think I now get why people are excited about static images and dialogue boxes. And I'm certain it's the game's cyclic nature that's managed to lasso my brain and keep it focused on the task at hand: help an AI trapped in a vending machine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After giving us an early glimpse of its unstoppable raptor hordes in a closed beta test last summer, Capcom recently let us loose with the opening hours of their upcoming dinosaur multiplayer shooter, Exoprimal. Its final release isn't far away now - its July 14th launch fast becoming the sole highlight of an otherwise desolate month - and I was excited to finally play the game that RPS vid bud Liam literally hasn't been able to stop talking about ever since he first clapped eyes (and his thumbs) on its somersaulting T-Rexes. (You should also read his excellent interview with the devs while you're at it, too). 
I'll hold my hands up now and say I didn't get to play as much of Exoprimal as I would have liked, but the handful of missions I did play really are as daft and brilliant as Liam described last year. I won't waste time repeating its fundamentals (you can read them here), but the basic setup is thus: in a world plagued by dinosaurs that periodically pour out of strange portals for some reason, you play a rookie dino hunter that gets pulled into a time-looping wargame set up by your company's clearly psychotic AI called Leviathan. In order to gather valuable 'combat data' for its simulations to fight said dinosaur threat, Leviathan endlessly ropes you and other rookie exosuit wearers into deadly feats of speed and skill. It's a neat, if patently preposterous setup for its 5v5 PvP multiplayer missions, but the thing that struck me most wasn't its gloriously silly dinosaurs or Leviathan's perfectly pitched ham lines. It was its bot companions, because heck, they're great to play with, but absolute fiends if you're on the wrong side of them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's no secret that Sony have been making increasing efforts to bring their exclusive PlayStation games to PC over the last couple of years, but one thing they've never quite been clear about is when we can expect to see them. They said a few years ago that we obviously shouldn't expect a simultaneous launch release, but some such as Death Stranding and The Last Of Us Part 1 have taken as little as six to eight months to come across, while others such as Spider-Man and Uncharted 4 have taken several years. 
According to PlayStation boss Jim Ryan, though, data from fans seem to suggest that the only "acceptable" route from a player point of view is a wait of two to three years. Outrageous, I say, but also: surely that means the long-sought-after Bloodborne must be next in line, right? Surely. It's been eight years, come on now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NetEase Games has announced the founding of a new game studio based in Canada. The studio is headed up by Sean Crooks, a former Ubisoft producer with credits ranging from Just Dance and Driver to the Watch Dogs franchise. Other members of the team include developers who have worked on series like Splinter Cell, Army of Two, Far Cry, and Child of Light.
The team hopes its first project will kickstart a new franchise. The title is an open-world, story-driven action/adventure title that draws inspiration from '80s action and horror films. Bad Brain is using Unreal Engine 5 to develop its debut title, which will launch across multiple platforms.
"I'm honored to be leading this talented team of developers in Canada," Crooks said in a press release. "We're all passionate about creating memorable and meaningful experiences. NetEase Games has given us a warm welcome, with an abundance of support and creative freedom to allow us to do what we do best. Our first game is a passion project that gives us the opportunity to truly free our brains."
NetEase, which is based in China, views this as an investment in the Canadian game-development industry. "We're thrilled to welcome Bad Brain Game Studios into our family and enriching our presence in Canada," NetEase Games president of global investments and partnerships Simon Zhu said in that same release. "With this new studio, NetEase Games continues its commitment to nurturing top-tier talent in Canada and creating games that players love. Canada has a thriving gaming industry, and we're excited to continue to be a part of it. We believe that our talented teams in Toronto, Montreal, and beyond will create some of the most innovative and exciting games the industry has seen."
Bad Brain Game Studios will have offices in Toronto, Ontario, and Montreal, Quebec, and will operate using a hybrid work model. To learn more, you can visit the studio's official website.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy 16 producer Naoki Yoshida has said he thinks "Maybe it's time we removed the numbers" from Final Fantasy games. In an interview with GQ, he talked about the baggage that inevitably comes with having a 35-year-old series with soon to be 16 numbered mainline games in it (not including the sequels and spin-offs, I might add), and the confusion it continues to create with new players. "Every numbered title we release in the series, we have to go into it like, 'It's OK, you don't have to play the rest of them,'" he said, and removing them is "something that I've discussed with the higher-ups". It's an understandable problem, for sure, although I think I'd be quite sad to see the numerals go entirely. As long as they don't pull a Mortal Kombat and go back to 1, though, we're good.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last july I was given the opportunity to play an early beta for Exoprimal, Capcom’s upcoming multiplayer shooter that pits you and a bunch of your mech suit-wearing buddies against unstoppable raptor hordes. In the nine months since I took command of a T-Rex and did a sick backflip, my life has not known peace. “I’m really excited to play Exoprimal” I’ll say to colleagues, unprompted, in important meetings unrelated to anything prehistoric in nature. “From what I've played, it blends PvE and PvP gameplay into a single multiplayer mode that feels very unique and hugely entertaining”. My tax return was voided because I drew a big stegosaurus on it. I have renamed the cat “Sniper Neosaur”, and I am disappointed that she has yet to emerge from a gooey purple orb.


It was my delight, then, to be given the opportunity to sit down with key members of the game’s development team to discuss Exoprimal’s inspirations, its inevitable comparisons to Dino Crisis and how Capcom plans to use it as a template for their live-service games moving forward. Alongside a fresh opportunity to check out the game, I hopped onto a Zoom call with Exoprimal’s director Takuro Hiraoka, technical director Kazuki Abe and art director Takuro Fuse.

Exoprimal’s time-traveling, dinosaur-blasting premise firmly positions it as one of the strangest multiplayer shooters on the horizon. Players have gotten to sample its insanity in a previous open beta, but a recent hands-on preview gave me a chance to peek into the game’s storytelling structure and customization. 
As a quick primer, Exoprimal tasks you and four other friends to team up to battle waves of invading dinosaurs. Outfitted in specialized exosuits, you’ll blast apart velociraptors, triceratops, and mighty T-Rexes in a race to finish missions befor…]]></summary>

It's also from the developers of Monster Train, however, the uncommonly good card game about stopping an onslaught aboard a multi-storey train to hell. That pedigree means it's worth noting that Inkbound is now in early access.

That's an awesome spec for gaming at 1080p, 1440p and even 4K - such is the power of this mighty GPU!  
To get this price, plus two freebies - a copy of Diablo 4 (£60) and a gaming headset (£30) - select the "No OS" option and use code GAMER40 at the checkout. 
You can of course opt to get Windows preinstalled if you prefer, but you can also use a USB stick and any unused Windows keys you've already got, including those from previous versions of Windows, to install the OS yourself. And, as the Steam Deck proves, gaming on Linux is getting pretty damn good - and of course, Linux is completely free (as in beer and as in speech).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since the PlayStation 3 generation, updates released on a game’s launch day, colloquially known as Day One patches or updates, have been the norm. Sometimes they’re small, squashing a few last-minute bugs, but other times, they’re massive and nigh essential to enjoying the adventure before you. 
However, Day One patches draw criticism from players excited to jump into the action, only to be left watching a download bar fill up. Some players with slower internet or limited access might be left waiting for hours, if not days, depending on download speeds. During my Final Fantasy XVI cover story trip, I asked the team about its March accomplishment of going gold and what the team was working on now. 
Final Fantasy XVI has gone gold.
#FF16's launch on June 22nd 🐺 pic.twitter.com/Vrtd3cMNW5
March 31, 2023
To my surprise, developer Creative Business Unit III isn’t working on a day one patch, a revelation that continues to become rarer with each new release in games. Director Hiroshi Takai gave me a few reasons as to why. 
The first is that the team is confident in its final build of Final Fantasy XVI. The second is that he and producer Naoki Yoshida (and the rest of the CBUIII team) believe the game should be ready to go at launch, recognizing that not everyone has access to the internet needed to download a day one patch in light of Final Fantasy XVI’s global simultaneous release. So as of right now, we won’t be downloading a big patch on June 22 when the game hits PlayStation 5. 
However, Takai notes that CBUIII is testing the game daily and searching for bugs, and things could change as a result, but right now, like in the days of old Final Fantasy, this entry should work entirely as expected out of the box.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the last six years, my Skyrim wood elf has been stuck in some godforsaken cave in goodness knows what corner of Tamriel. I don't remember why they were there, or what goal they were trying to achieve. It was just 'one of those caves' that looked cool and interesting when I came across it and I thought, 'Yeah, all right, let's have a go then, shall we?' But while other Skyrim caves I'd come across could be easily polished off in an office lunch-time - as that was often how I played Skyrim back then - this one was different somehow. It was so large and twisty, so infinitely befuddling, that I seemed to be trapped down there forever. Sure, I could have probably turned back, but I'd been down there for ages, and felt like I'd come too far to simply not see it all through to the bitter end. But the end never came, and I eventually abandoned my save as a result, whisked off by the prospect of newer, more exciting games that didn't involve trying to figure out how to escape its narrow, bioluminescent hellscape.
Worse still, this disastrous feat of orienteering has now become my overriding memory of Skyrim. For all its great sidequests and its ever-increasing number of excellent mods, all I ever think about are its damn caves. Just the thought of loading up that save file again makes me grimace, and I'm starting to dread the thought of getting stuck in another one whenever the heck The Elder Scrolls 6 comes out. But I've been playing a lot of The Legend Of Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom this past week, and cor, I'm immediately jealous of Link's Ascend ability. As part of his new slate of powers, Ascend lets him instantly woosh through almost any ceiling as long as there's a traversable bit of terrain above it. That kind of power wouldn't have been half handy for my poor old wood elf, and it's precisely what makes exploring Tears Of The Kingdom's caves so enjoyable. So if there's one thing The Elder Scrolls 6 should steal take note of, please let it be this.

The G920 is the Xbox-oriented model, meaning it works on PC plus Xbox Series and One consoles, while the G29 is for PC plus PS4 and PS5 - so choose what's most useful to you!

So far, Remedy have only committed to a general 2023 release for Alan Wake 2, but voice actor Matthew Porretta told the Monsters, Madness And Magic podcast that it's "supposed to come out in October". That means it should be well clear of ye olde Starfield, but that "supposed to" also suggests the date isn't set in stone yet. Here's hoping we get a more formal date at this year's Summer Games Fest, perhaps.

The difficulties of writing a column reliant upon a collapsing platform continue to be felt in a week when the #screenshotsaturday tag became overrun with spambots, but the games still shone through. This week, my eye was caught by colourful driving experiences in run 'n' guns and visual novels, multiple terrible squiggly beasts from horror games, a cute N64-style platformer, and lots more attractive and interesting indie games. Come see!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XVI was surprise revealed in 2020 as a PlayStation 5 exclusive, and Square Enix and PlayStation have remained closely aligned throughout its showings since then. Be it State of Plays, PlayStation Showcases, or even PlayStation Blogs, it’s clear Final Fantasy XVI is a big release for Sony. 
During my cover story trip to Square Enix’s Tokyo, Japan, offices, I asked producer Naoki Yoshida how developer Creative Business Unit III feels about the game’s PS5 exclusivity and what that does for the studio in terms of development. He says it’s important to distinguish that CBUIII doesn’t go into game development thinking it wants to limit a game to just one platform or company. When the team started development on FFXVI, the studio “looked at all options,” Yoshida says.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[All Elite Wrestling fans have anxiously awaited the company’s first video game AEW: Fight Forever, since its announcement in 2020. That wait finally comes to an end next month.
As announced by AEW star and executive VP Kenny Omega in the trailer below, Fight Forever is launching on June 29. Developed by the former long-time maker of WWE games Yuke’s and published by THQ Nordic, the game serves as a throwback to the ‘90s-era AKI-engine arcade-style games like WCW/nWo Revenge and WWF No Mercy (even enlisting the expertise of No Mercy director Hideyuki “Geta” Iwashita).


Fight Forever includes over 10 gameplay modes, including a Career Mode, online play, and a full customization suite that lets players create wrestlers, teams, move sets, entrances, and arenas. Match-types include: 
Singles
Tag-Team
3-Way
4-Way
Ladder Match
Casino Battle Royale
Falls Count Anywhere
Unsanctioned Lights Out
Exploding Barbed Wire Death Match
The complete roster has still not been shared officially, but here are the wrestlers we know are in the game based on previous reveals, interviews, and videos. Keep in mind that this is almost certainly not the entire playable roster: 
Abadon
Adam Cole
Adam Page
Bryan Danielson
Chris Jericho
CM Punk (probably)
Cody Rhodes (yes, really)
Darby Allin
Dr. Britt Baker, D.M.D.
Hikaru Shida
Jade Cargill
Jon Moxley
Jungle Boy
Kenny Omega
Kris Statlander
Matt Hardy
Matt Jackson 
Miro
MJF
Nick Jackson 
Nyla Rose
Orange Cassidy
Owen Hart
Paul Wight
Pentagon
Sting
Thunder Rosa
Yuka Sakazaki
AEW: Fight Forever is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

I played Final Fantasy XVI during a recent preview event in February, but it was focused almost entirely on combat. I enjoyed the combat a lot – you can read my thoughts here – but my latest hands-on with the game happened during my cover story trip to Square Enix’s Tokyo, Japan, offices. I played a few hours of the game, which is what everyone who’s part of this latest wave of previews played, and that’s what I’ll be talking about here. 
But I also saw never-before-seen gameplay, received an exclusive tour of some areas in FFXVI, learned about its endgame, and more for this month’s Game Infor…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Planet of Lana has all the hallmarks of a story-rich platformer. Across its six-hour run time, you'll encounter a string of environmental puzzles, an evil plan concocted by a group of baddies, a rich orchestral soundtrack that swells at all the right moments, a cute animal companion, and a gorgeous world that needs saving. 
On paper, it has everything you could possibly want from this kind of game, but in practice, it can also be Lana's undoing at times. It does everything well - admittedly some much better than others - but it feels like this sci-fi tale is missing something. That gut punch, that sigh of relief after a thrill, that unexpected surprise... You know, that extra edge to really make it sing. It’s still a very enjoyable adventure, but its lack of emotional highs means it doesn't linger long in the memory once you've seen the credits roll. Is that a roundabout way to say that Planet of Lana is a solid 7/10? Maybe, but we don't do that here.

Since the release of Limbo in 2010, cinematic puzzle platformers have relied on capturing players’ attention and imagination with beautiful art directions and compelling, often enigmatic storytelling. As typically brief experiences, the moment-to-moment puzzles must hit hard with clever, memorable obstacles and not meander by rehashing familiar mechanics too often. Planet of Lana almost hits this sweet spot by boasting a gorgeous presentation, but trekking through this strange world doesn’t always inspire the same awe.

That's because it's their last update to the prison simulator originally created by Introversion Software. The update was also released alongside a trailer thanking fans for supporting the game, which also seemingly teases a 3D sequel.

SCS Software have got better at replicating the long roads and countryside of the United States, however, so they've also been going back periodically and revamping their very first. Five cities in northern California were updated last year in a second update, and work is ongoing on a third phase of revisions that should arrive soon. SCS Software this week shared screenshots of their new Santa Cruz, which has been "revamped from the ground up".

Its developers, Pocketpair, haven't updated it since, instead pouring their work into similarly expansive "everything game" Craftopia and the Pokémon-alike (but with guns) Palworld.

Now Pocketpair have released a content update for Overdungeon and say that previous radio silence was because they were "a bit tired and struggled with our contract with the publisher."

All those themes suggest a heavy, self-serious game. But Kujlevka's great strength is its levity. While not particularly funny, its consistent wry humour perfectly counterbalances all the talk of political chaos, existential futility, and petty greed. Its opening should have been a clue, really, considering you hang out with skeletons while drinking and commenting on the food on a train in outer space.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Of the various corporatised fictional universes out there, Star Wars is the one I'm most emotionally invested in. But my affection for George Lucas' brain-baby is less about the stories and characters, and more about the general vibe of the galaxy itself. I love its retro-futurist junkpunk style, the rusty spaceships, dusty planets, and fusty aliens. That's why I've more fondness for games like Dark Forces and KotOR than any of the films or TV shows, as they let me poke around locations like Tatooine and Ord Mantell at my own pace.


Hence, the idea of being properly, immerse in Star Wars, to be physically surrounded by it and able to touch it, is probably my ultimate VR fantasy. Sod the imaginatively inert virtual spaces of Horizon Worlds, if Mark Zuckerberg really wanted to sell the Metaverse to me, he'd build the whole thing out in Mos Eisely chic, and let me run my own virtual cantina selling NFT space-drinks to legless bounty hunters and idiot Web3 prospectors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Does that pommel horse have a grenade launcher?" is one of many bizarre questions I found myself asking while playing HROT. This Slavic shooter revels in the strange, straddling the line between hyper-bleak Soviet satire and goofy memetic joke factory. This isn't the best thing about HROT, we'll get to that in a couple of paragraphs. But the balancing of these two personality strands is what defines HROT's quality. At the outset, they exist in perfect symbiosis, but the relationship becomes less stable as the game goes on.
The year is 1986, and something is seriously wrong in the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. What that might be isn't explicitly stated, but given the year, the ambient chatter of Geiger counters, and the soldiers vomiting through their gasmasks as they prowl the abandoned streets, a nuclear disaster at an infamous Ukrainian power plant isn't a vast stretch of the imagination. In any case, anyone who wasn't killed by the fallout is now being hunted by an army of (presumably Russian, but again, it isn't explicated) soldiers. Emerging from a bomb shelter beneath Prague's Kosmonautů Metro Station (now named Háje), you take it upon yourself to defend your glorious homeland from these invaders.

I know you’ve all been waiting for your favourite PC gaming-focused website to offer their take on it so there you go. It’s properly, properly good. The best open-world adventure since Elden Ring, except arguably better because it doesn’t pull your trousers down and point out the colour of your underwear every time you dare to explore a forest or watch a sunset.


As you’ve probably seen, the game’s biggest new draw is “Ultrahand”, which allows Link to pick up loose objects and glue them together. Three logs make a raft. A plank and four wheels make a car. Two stones and a log make a... Ahem. You get the idea. In addition to this are “Zonai Devices”, components that give life and movement to your doohickeys. A fan pushes your raft across the lake. A steering stick lets you manoeuvre your little car. It’s a marvellous construction system that leverages the pre-existing physics engine seen in the game’s predecessor, Breath Of The Wild, to startling results. Does this all sound familiar?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update (22nd May): This is the final day to grab this excellent deal on an Ergotron-built monitor arm! Original article continues: 
Ergotron make some of the best monitor arms around - reliable, capable and generally brilliant - but they're also pretty pricey. That's probably why Amazon hit up Ergotron to make its Amazon Basics monitor arms, which offer the same excellent quality in unbranded form for considerably less money. 
Today though one of these arms is even better value than usual, as there's a ridiculous 40% off voucher available on Amazon's take on the Ergotron LX, dropping this high-end monitor arm from £81 to just £49. That's a brilliant price for an arm that can support monitors up to 11kg in weight with full tilt, swivel, rotation and height adjustability.

Unlike those drives though, the MP600 Pro LPX comes with a heatsink by default and is often priced more aggressively, making it a great value choice that doesn't sacrifice performance. Today this drive has dropped to £74.98 on Amazon UK, a historic low price that makes it easy to justify an SSD upgrade for your PC or PS5.

Five years after the multiplayer mech FPS shut down on PC, now requiring a fan-made fix even just to play offline against bots, I didn't expect to ever again dash around its cool sci-fi cityscapes as a charmingly scrappy little stomper. So I was excited when publishers 505 Games announced singleplayer follow-up Hawken Reborn on Monday then launched it into early access two days later. Having now played it, oh dear. You know, it's okay for the dead to stay dead.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's difficult not to start out by namedropping Dwarf Fortress. Songs Of Syx will compare to probably every colony sim you've played, in fact, but it feels like a fundamentally different game conceptually.
The usual parts are there. Chop some trees, chip some stones, and chep some crops to get your pioneers' basic needs met, then get to expanding. But Syx isn't interested in testing you or manufacturing drama. It's not about surviving, not about building a happy little colony. It's about how growth changes not just the scale, but the nature of a settlement. Despite similarities with its influences, it defines itself with a different dynamic, a whole different ethos to its peers. And it's one that even playing it my own awkward way hasn't broken.

We (attempt to) talk about our favourite Zelda games of the past, our favourite Zelda-likes on PC, and I explain how Tears Of The Kingdom works to Nate and James. Honestly though, we don't make it very far, because it turns out the lads haven't ever played a Zelda game before. At least, Nate might have. We're not entirely sure. 


We do also talk about what we've been playing this week as well - which include some old favourites, some new secrets, and Gaben's tiny hands - and give some great new recommendations. Nate also delivers a very involved mini-game involving beans and aliens, and James doesn't talk about the Asus ROG Ally.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While working on an automated opt-in survey (about which I write in a bit), it was noticed that our privacy policy and cookie policy is rather out-of-date. Mostly, we used to store a lot more personal information when you created an account, like email addresses, passwords, etc. As we now use GitHub to handle all that, we can slim down our privacy policy, as we store very little personal information. For the cookie policy, for years now we only use cookies for the authenticated part of our websites and nothing else. OpenTTD’s privacy policy has always been: we want to know as little personal information about you as possible. And although these changes were rolled out years ago, the policies did not reflect that yet. They do now! In short: we removed statements from the policy about information we track, as we haven’t done that for years now. So, what about this automated opt-in survey you are talking about?]]></summary>
