Amongst other things, they'd reach over and flick the power off while I was playing The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening. I didn't finish that game for 15 years. I'd flown the family nest before I braved the Eagle's Tower. Can you imagine what my friends would have done if I'd owned a Game Boy Camera? Probably, they'd have taken photos of... bottoms with it, and such. 
I'm aware I'm not making a great case for being a graduate of the School of Hard Knocks. The point is: I didn't have a Game Boy Camera then, so I'm delighted that the Game Boy Camera has caught on among a later generation of indie PC developers - prominent among them artist and educator Catharine Graffam, whose GB Camera Gallery: Mystery Show you can play for free in a browser.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fortnite's Star Wars event is now live, and with it comes opportunities to get multiple themed character skins, items, and more. You need to complete Star Wars quests to unlock certain rewards, with one of your first goals requiring you to collect an E-11 Blaster Rifle from a fallen Stormtrooper.


How to eliminate a Stormtrooper and collect their E-11 Blaster Rifle in Fortnite x Star Wars event


Eliminating Stormtroopers during Fortnite's Star Wars event requires visiting Stormtrooper camps and defeating any that spawn. Like regular players, you'll initially knock them down when you beat them in a fight, with an extra hit eliminating them entirely. After doing this, they'll drop some gold, ammo, and an E-11 Blaster Rifle for you to use on others.

Once you arrive at a camp, you'll find several Stormtroopers wandering around and various tents containing loot. You can pick up quick floor loot to snag a quick elimination or find an Imperial Chest to obtain better items. Either way, eliminate at least one Stormtrooper to obtain an E-11 Blaster Rifle, knocking out your first Star Wars quest.

Be careful of other players as you approach these camps. During the event's first few days, you'll often find at least one or two other people storming these camps. Prepare for battles by picking up weapons, health kits, and shield drinks early while watching your surroundings. In some cases, someone might get to Stormtrooper enemy eliminations before you do, so approaching a camp early can help you knock out this objective quickly before moving on to your next one.


After picking up an E-11 Blaster Rifle, you can use it to attack any other NPC or player during your match. While it isn't an overpowered weapon, its unlimited ammo and solid damage output can help you out of sticky situations if you have no other options.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The excitement around Fortnite's Star Wars event has hit high gear, but players jumping into the game to get involved are finding themselves locked out after being hit with "Matchmaking Error #1: You do not have permission to play."


Players who try to get into matches are being told that it "Looks like all the Battle Buses headed out are full. Give it another shot in a few minutes." Unfortunately, even if you leave it for a bit, trying again will see you hit with the same error.

What's causing Fortnite's "You do not have permission to play" error?


This frustrating bug seems to be coming from Epic's side, so there doesn't seem to be much that can be done at this point. It appears that the game is having issues with its servers, which are either overcrowded or simply not allowing anyone into matches. 


Is there anything I can do to fix the error?


It seems unlikely that there's anything we can do on our end to solve this, but if you want to try some things, there are a few options: 



Restart the game: Always the first thing you should try, but some players on X have reported that this is helping. 


Restart your internet: This seems to be on Epic's side, but if you're desperate you could try to reset your internet on the off-chance it's actually a problem on your end. 



Other than those, the sad answer is you'll just have to wait for Epic to get them back online. 


Has Epic responded to this Fortnite error?


No, unfortunately, Epic have yet to address the issue, with nothing posted on their Fortnite Status account on X. We'll be sure to update this article if we hear from the developer. 




If you've managed to make it into Fortnite, learn how to get the new Chewbacca skin, or read about the LEGO Fortnite Star Wars Quests.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Arrowhead Game Studios and Sony Interactive Entertainment have announced that Helldivers 2 on Steam will soon require a PlayStation Network account to play. All new players from May 30 will have to link their Steam account to a PSN account, and all current players will have to do so by June 4. 
Up until this point, a PSN account was not required to play Helldivers 2 on PC via Steam, and with the sudden switch-up, players have taken to the game's Steam reviews to express their frustration. Admittedly, the game's rating is still "Very Positive," with roughly 80% of user reviews falling into this category, but that 80% is lower than it has been in the weeks prior. And now, if you look at the game's recent reviews, you'll find plenty of negative ratings over the required PSN account change. 
SIE says due to "technical issues at the launch of Helldivers 2, we allowed the linking requirements for Steam accounts to a PlayStation Network account to be temporarily optional. That grace period will now expire." That expiration begins on May 6 for new players and June 4 for current players. 
While frustration is understood, it's important to note a PlayStation console is not required to create a PSN account – creating one is free and can be done online, no PlayStation 5 required. SIE encourages players to do so ahead of the June 4 change. 
"We understand that while this may be an inconvenience to some of you, this step will help us continue to build a community that you are all proud to be a part of," the announcement reads.

Check out Game Informer's Helldivers 2 review to find out why we think it's a must-play game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Star Wars Day is upon us, which means an epic crossover event is happening in Fortnite. While Han Solo has been in the game for years, his trusty companion Chewie has been noticeable by his absence. Finally, though, the legendary Wookie is here, and we know how to unlock Chewbacca in Fortnite. 


With Star Wars taking over the game to celebrate May 4, both the Rebels and Empire are coming to not only Battle Royale, but LEGO Fortnite, Rocket Racing, and even Fortnite Festival. While all these additions are definitely welcome, for many, it's the cosmetics that they're looking forward to the most. 


That's why plenty of Star Wars fans are so happy to see Chewbacca finally appear in the game. Arriving with his Wookie Bowcaster, players will be able to buy Chewie, but may be confused if they head to the Item Shop and discover he's not there. 


How to unlock Chewbacca in Fortnite


To unlock Chewbacca in Fortnite, you'll need to purchase the Star Wars Rebel Adventure pass. This can be found at the top of your screen between the 'Play' and 'Locker' tabs. The Premium Track pass costs 1,400 V-Bucks, and instantly unlocks the Chewie skin.

Players will get two versions of Chewbacca: A regular version that can be used in Battle Royale and Fortnite Festival, and a LEGO Fortnite version exclusive to that mode. 


The Rebel Adventure pass will also allow players to unlock Star Wars-themed LEGO Fortnite buildings by completing Quests, so you can turn your world into Tatooine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Level-5 is back!
In late 2020, Level-5 shuttered its operations in the West and effectively ended its business outside of Japan, leaving Western fans of franchises such as Yo-Kai Watch and Professor Layton wondering if they would ever see English versions of new entries in their favorite series. Fortunately, the company has since reinvigorated its efforts in the West and one of the new projects to emerge is Megaton Musashi W: Wired. As an enhanced re-release of a previously Japan-only action RPG, this mech battler brings a lot of style, charm, and raw action to the table, marking a strong return to form for Level-5.
Megaton Musashi W begins by introducing us to Yamato Ichidaiji, a lonely and headstrong teen haunted by unfocused memories of a house fire that apparently killed his little sister. Yamato has a penchant for picking fights with other kids in the quiet suburban streets of Akagicho, often landing him in hot water with the law, and he’s soon offered a way out of his legal troubles when he’s approached by some mysterious agents who see great potential in his fighting capabilities. Yamato begrudgingly accepts their offer to join their “Oblivion Bay” program, only to quickly learn the awful truth that he’s been unknowingly living his whole life in a fortified shelter on a devastated Earth, which was ravaged when aliens called Draktors invaded and killed nearly the entire human population. The aliens are hellbent on finishing the job, but they’re held at bay by the fists and firepower of mighty piloted mech robots called Rogues, one of which is granted to Yamato to continue the fight.

Following a rather blatant tease from reliable leaker Pyoro, a rating has appeared via the ESRB for Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition for the Nintendo Switch (thanks, Stealth).
Described as "a collection of 2D challenges and platformer games", it's also noted that the game will likely contain in-game purchases. What these are exactly is unknown at this time, but hopefully Nintendo will have an official announcement lined up soon.

After successfully taking down the open-source Switch emulator Yuzu, Nintendo is on the warpath once again and has wiped out a total of 8535 Yuzu repositories via GitHub in one go.
As reported by TorrentFreak (thanks, Eurogamer), Nintendo had filed a DMCA notice to GitHub earlier this week, targeting Yuzu repositories that it states "provide access to the Yuzu emulator or code based on the yuzu emulator  illegally circumvents Nintendo's technological protection measures and runs illegal copies of Nintendo Switch games".

But others did, sometimes complaining about the art style, which was a chunky and plastic-looking departure from previous games in the series. It's now almost seven years later but at least one person has not forgotten this missed opportunity. A fighting game modder has been tinkering with shaders to bring the comic book style of previous games to Infinite. Looks cool.

In a May 3 news post on Steam, Sony has alerted PC players that PlayStation accounts will become mandatory for brand-new players starting from Monday, May 6. The mandatory log-in won't appear for current PC players until May 30, and then they'll have until June 4 to link their accounts or be forced to stop playing.




You may be wondering why Sony is enforcing this change roughly three months after Helldivers 2's launch, but this was always supposed to be the plan. Back in February, the launch period suffered from its fair share of te…]]></summary>

At one point it was trending on Steam and since then it's garnered loads of positive reviews, with people saying it's unsettling and drips with atmosphere. Reader, I do think it's quite atmospheric, but I do not think it's all that unsettling. If anything, I find it a bit dull, in a way that's semi-frustrating. Am I missing the liminal space-liker bit of the brain a lot of people have? Am I an anomaly here?

The BAL-27 is the big weapon addition in Season 3 Reloaded, and will be instantly recognizable to those who played Advanced Warfare. When guns are added to Warzone and MW3, they generally shoot straight to the top of the meta, but that wasn't the case for the BAL-27, and we now know why. 


Just hours after it was added the game, the BAL-27 was nerfed by 25%, as first discovered by dantheflipman on Reddit. I've since gone and checked myself and can confirm the new damage numbers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wano is the longest story Arc in One Piece, and features an epic showdown between Luffy and Kaido. Here is everything we know about the highly anticipated bout that will go down in history as one of the best fights of the series. 


Eiichiro Oda divided the Wano Country Arc in One Piece into three acts. The third and final act includes a fight that will inevitably shift the balance of power and set up the final stage of the story. Ever since Luffy and Law originally formed their pirate alliance in Punk Hazard several arcs ago, the ultimate goal has been to take down Kaido. Unforeseen circumstances delayed that task, but the duo finally get a chance to fulfill their goal in Wano. 


What episode does the Luffy vs. Kaido fight begin?


Image via Toei Animation 


In episode 914, Luffy starts fighting Kaido. Amid a drunken rampage, Kaido destroys Oden's castle, prompting Luffy to challenge one of the Four Emperors to a battle. Without giving too much away, fans shouldn't go into this battle expecting it to be short and sweet. Kaido is renowned as the world's "strongest creature," so Luffy was never going to take down the giant with just one Gomu Gomu no Mi punch.

A main talking point during the stream was a focus on lessening time spent "sorting" through loot after a brief outing in, say, a Nightmare Dungeon. Less affixes, more meaningful drops, and a higher potential for customization via the new Tempering and Masterworking systems means far less time spent straining your eyes comparing every pair of pants. 


Another change that aims to pare down useless loot drops is more guaranteed sources of item level 925 gear. Obol gambling will provide 925 gear, guaranteed, in World Tier 4 at level 100. Helltides, too, will drop maximum item level gear.

Eiichiro Oda divided One Piece into two halves. The Final Sea: The New World Saga starts with Fishman Island, as the Straw Hat pirates finally reconnect and begin their voyage on the second half of the Grand Line. One Piece tends to follow a pattern of alternating between short and long Arcs. Fans will notice that Fishman Island will feel much smaller in scope and scale compared to other adventures.

When does the Fishman Island Arc end in the One Piece anime?

Episode 574 is the final episode of the Fishman Island Arc in One Piece. The Arc is 51 episodes long, starting with 523. If fans want to avoid filler, they can skip episode 542, a crossover with the Toriko anime. Immediately following Fishman Island's conclusion fans can also opt to skip episodes 575 through 578 as they are also filler that follows the story of a thief who stole food from the Thousand Sunny. 


After Fishman Island, One Piece dives headfirst into the epic saga of Dressrosa. Fans will have to buckle in for a much longer journey than Fishman Island, but fans certainly won't be disappointed.

How to get Temporal Erosion in Warframe


To get the Temporal Erosion mod in Warframe, you must reach the final rank in either the Arbiters of Hexis or the Perrin Sequence Syndicates. The mod will cost 25,000 Standing and will come unranked.


The reason why you have to progress to the maximum level in those respective Syndicates is because Warframe Augment Mods become available at that rank. This applies to the four other pledge-able ones in the game too (ex. Steel Meridian, Red Veil, …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even if you've found most of EVE's ancient artifacts, you can stumble on a roadblock that forbids mission progression. Specifically, the Ancient Processor Blueprint won't spawn during the Does Not Compute mission. I, amongst many players, have encountered this issue, but fortunately, there's a way to fix it. 


DDV Ancient Processor Blueprint not spawning solution


Restart your game or start another mission to fix the Ancient Processor not spawning issue in Disney Dreamlight Valley. Many players have found that a simple restart can do the trick. However, if it's still causing you trouble, the second option might be your best bet. 


Deactivate the Does Not Compute quest and start another mission. While this other quest is active, return to The Docks and use the Hourglass. Remember that the item must be claimed inside EVE's hideout, marked with the star icon on the map below, as other objects will appear outside its boundaries. Once I did this, the Ancient Processor Blueprint finally decided to show up. You can then reactivate Does Not Compute to progress further.

In my experience, non-quest-related items can sometimes restrict the ancient artifact's spawn. You may also encounter the 'There is no more treasure in this area. Look elsewhere' notification when looking for it. Thus, if you run into these problems, use one of the solutions above to refresh it.  


Some players have encountered this issue with other Does Not Compute items, including the Ancient Slate. Luckily, the fixes here work for these objects, too.

Its first trailer showing in-game footage is below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The 81st Final Fantasy XIV Live Letter From the Producer finally has a scheduled broadcast time and, as many have been expecting, it will focus primarily on Job information for the upcoming expansion Dawntrail.


The wait for Dawntrail is nearly over, with the release date for the next expansion set for just two months from now on July 2 and early access a few days earlier, so of course the dev team is promoting it and giving out more information about what to expect. 


The next Live Letter From the Producer, which will be streaming live on May 16, is set to include some much anticipated 7.0 Job updates. Alongside details for the new Viper and Pictomancer jobs, there will hopefully be more information given on the overhauls coming to both Astrologian and Dragoon. 


If you’re uncertain as to whether your setup can handle the massive graphical updates coming with Dawntrail, there’s still time to download and try out the Benchmark.


How to watch FFXIV Live Letter 81


As always, the Live Letter will be streamed live on both the FFXIV YouTube channel and the FFXIV Twitch channel. 


The stream is set to start at 7 a.m. EST / 4 a.m. PST / 12 p.m. GMT on Thursday, May 16, so this one might be a little tricky to watch live in the US. However, as always, the stream will be available to watch after the fact on the FFXIV YouTube channel.


Thankfully, this Live Letter will include a live translation from Japanese to English, so we won’t be left guessing any of the details, which is especially handy given the technical aspects of Job showcases.

On the one hand, you've got to deal with interdimensional horrors of various flavours, such as multiple-storey cryptids and squishy skinless wolves; on the other, invading squads of Combiney soldiers. Fortunately, you've got a big fat Ivy League brain stuffed with knowledge of killer gadgets, base construction, subterranean farming and battlefield medicine. My increasing phobia for survival games notwithstanding, I think this looks and sounds like a hoot - and it's out now in early access. Here's the launch trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After multiple delays and questions about the title's future, Ubisoft finally confirmed an official release date for XDefiant, and fans don't have to wait much longer.  


Ubisoft revealed that XDefiant will launch on May 21 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. The free-to-play FPS title features 14 maps, 24 weapons, five modes, and five factions. One of those game modes includes a Ranked Mode practice playlist to test out 4v4 competitive matches.


XDefiant was originally planned to hit shelves in the late summer of 2023, but a submission snafu delayed its release. Then, an October launch day also fell through because of party code and net code issues. After another delay in March, the FPS title could finally host a server test session in late April and iron out a few last wrinkles.

With no more roadblocks in the way, Ubisoft laid out the framework for future content. After the initial six-week Preseason event,  XDefiant will get new weapons, maps, events, and a new faction every three months. Year One includes four Seasons that will add four factions, 12 weapons, and 12 maps. The devs did not provide any details about which Season players should expect to add an official ranked mode or private matches. Ubisoft teases that there will be more details about the title leading up to the official release date.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You've survived starvation, wolves, those rolling rock monsters, and so much more to build your perfect village in Lego Fortnite. It sure would be a shame if an evil empire rolled up and started blasting. Luckily for you, a rebel fleet is ready to back you up against the dark side of The Force.


A new Star Wars update is launching for Fortnite on May 3, and with it comes a massive expansion to Lego Fortnite. We'll investigate the crash site of an Empire vessel after it rifts into our Lego Fortnite world. There's a ramshackle rebel village that we'll help build into a Level 10. From there, we can launch assaults on Empire encampments throughout the island. All of this looks to be adding a much more focused narrative hook to the otherwise free-reign of Lego Fortnite.




This event will also include the addition of a Lego Pass. With a free track and paid track, you can unlock various structures and items by completing quests. Purchasing the premium track for 1400 V-Bucks immediately gets you Chewbacca skins for Lego Fortnite and Battle Royale. At the end of each track is a large construction unlock. For the free path, you get the Mos Eisley Marketplace. The paid path gets you the Dusty Durrr Burger Build. It combines the Star Wars aesthetic and a Fortnite classic.

Along with all the Star Wars excitement, this update also comes with a lot more Fortnite skins getting a proper Lego version. 90 skins will have new models, including Darth Vader, Krrsantan, and The Mandalorian.


Forget all the Star Wars; the biggest feature of this update is that you'll finally be able to view Lego Fortnite Quests without having to return to the Lobby. Thank the Force for that one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Enemy players and AI can be a formidable force, often overwhelming you on the battlefield. However, in Gray Zone Warfare's PvE mode, you can forge alliances and find support almost everywhere you go. Discover how to play this mode and what it entails.


How do you play PvE mode in Gray Zone Warfare?


Select 'Joint Operations' at the main menu to begin PvE mode in Gray Zone Warfare. This option will be available once you've customized your character and chosen a faction. By default, it will initially be set to 'Warfare,' Gray Zone Warfare's PvEvP mode, so remember to change this spec. 


Screenshot by Destructoid


In GZW's PvE mode, other players cannot harm you. Even if they direct a gun at you and start blasting bullets (trust me, I've had my fair share of this experience), no damage will be inflicted. Everyone works together and shares the same goal of eradicating enemy forces on Lamang Island.


Joint Operations is more accessible than Warfare, especially if you're a solo player. However, AI enemies can still be just as brutal. Keep medical supplies on you always, just in case things go south.


Missions are still the same in both Warfare and Joint Operations. So, don't worry about missing out on certain storylines. It would help if you also considered changing your region, which will be at the bottom of the Warfare/Joint Operations section. Since the game won't automatically use your current location, adjusting it for the correct servers is essential.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Trying to make a build for anything in Warframe can be a daunting prospect. You need to find eight separate mods that synergize well with a specific purpose, level those mods up, Forma various slots so you can fit these mods, and find an Arcane that suits that build well. That build may not even do well after all that time and effort. 


One of the new weapons added with Protea Prime's release is a good weapon to make a build for, provided you like the feel of the original variant. Here's the best build for Okina Prime in Warframe.


The best mod setup for Okina Prime in Warframe


The Okina Prime is best known for its high Attack Speed and Crit Chance values without factoring in mods, so we're looking for mods that further enhance both stats. This turns the Okina Prime into a dual-dagger powerhouse, dealing tons of damage in a flurry of attacks to overwhelm your opponent. The best mods for this setup are as follows:



Spinning Needle (Stance)


Blood Rush


Gladiator Vice


Quickening


Primed Fever Strike


Organ Shatter


Weeping Wounds


Condition Overload


Berserker Fury



This leaves the Exilus slot unused, though you'll be required to use a few more Forma on these blades to get something interesting slotted in. You can do that if you enjoy min-maxing, but it's unnecessary. You can also swap out Organ Shatter for a Riven mod if you dabble in that sort of thing.


As for the Arcane, I suggest you slot in either Melee Crescendo or Melee Duplicate based on personal preference. Melee Crescendo ups that initial Combo Counter, letting you dish out even more Crits with that heightened Critical Chance off your mods. Melee Duplicate, on the other hand, is more DPS. Who doesn't want more DPS?

        <updated>2024-05-02T16:35:57.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The release of new Prime frames in Warframe is always a big moment for players. Not only is it a new way to get Mastery, but it's a fun rush as you scrounge up any relics you can to give yourself a shot at getting parts for the new frame and weapons. The normal way to get these relics is to farm them from missions, though there's another way that can be a bit faster. Here's where you can buy Relic Packs in Warframe.


Where to purchase Relic Packs in Warframe


Relic Packs are available as part of the offerings of any of the six Syndicates, going for a rate of one Relic Pack for every 20,000 Standing. That means if you have the max Standing with a Syndicate, you can get six Relic Packs for a total of 18 Relics. The offerings of each Syndicate are found by accessing the appropriate console at the front left of your Orbiter's cockpit and selecting your highest-ranking Syndicate.


If you have excess Standing with any of the major open-world factions (found in Cetus, Fortuna, and the Necralisk), then you can interact with the mining vendor at that location to purchase Relic Packs for 20,000 Standing.


There's one final way to get Relic Packs, though not through Standing. By completing all nodes on the star chart and unlocking The Steel Path, you can interact with Teshin at any relay and look at his Steel Path Honors shop to purchase 25 Relic Packs a week, going at 15 Steel Essence per pack. This resets every Sunday at 5 p.m. PT, making it a good way to get a ton of relics should you play Steel Path regularly.


Are Relic Packs worth getting?


Whether you should buy these Relic Packs depends entirely on your patience. It is possible to farm specific relics from various missions, though you depend on RNG more heavily than Relic Packs. These are more efficient, though you could snag a ton of junk relics if luck isn't on your side. If you have a ton of Standing or Steel Essence collecting dust, then knock yourself out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Leonardo Da Vinci's Vitruvian Man is a legendary drawing of a nude with his arms and legs reaching towards the rim and corners of a circle and square. It's often invoked as an archetype for the humanist worldview of Man the Measure and Centre of all Things, holding a perfectly proportioned universe in shape. Rin D'Lorah, the heroine of new narrative RPG Sky Of Tides, is a bit like the Vitruvian Man, and the result is a game I find at once bewitching and powerfully offputting in its refusal to satisfy the conventions of the genre.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Keoken Interactive, developer of Deliver Us The Moon and Deliver Us Mars, has laid off nearly its entire staff. The studio’s two founders are the only remaining employees.
Founders Keon Deetman (CEO) and Paul Deetman (managing director) announced on social media that after the studio failed to secure funding during the Game Developer’s Conference (GDC) in March, it had “exhausted all our possible options for publishing, work for hire, and co-development.” As a result, the remainder of its staff has been let go. GameIndustry.biz confirmed that 13 employees were affected, 11 of which were full-time and 2 freelance contractors. 
The Deetmans have made a call for any studios with open positions to hire its affected staff. The founders plan to stay in business and have vowed to rebuild, which includes launching a Kickstarter to crowdfund Deliver Us Home,  a sequel to Deliver Us Mars. 
It was clear Keoken was in trouble when the founders posted a video in March revealing it had been unable to land a publishing deal after spending two years pitching five games to over 40 publishers. Instead, the founders decided to publicly reveal these projects to help garner interest, one of which was Deliver Us Home and two were Deliver Us The Moon spin-offs, including a VR game. 
Keoken once employed 45 employees, but the headcount was reduced to 20 by March 2024 before four more employees were let go that month. In an interview with GameIndustry.biz, the Deetmans revealed they had gone months without collecting a salary to help stay afloat.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Universal Orlando Resort has released a new video detailing what to expect at its Florida-based Super Nintendo World when it opens as a land in its Epic Universe theme park next year. In it, the company confirms the land will have three rides, including the Donkey Kong Mine Cart Madness coaster that's expected to open later this year in Osaka, Japan's Super Nintendo World. 
The video includes digital fly-overs of the park, showing viewers what it will look like when it opens next year. If you've seen Super Nintendo World in Japan, this park looks nearly identical, with both the Donkey Kong Country (and mine cart coaster) section and the Mushroom Kingdom with Peach's Castle, Mt. Beanpole, the Mario Kart: Bowser's Challenge augmented-reality ride and Yoshi's Adventure dark ride. 
Check it out for yourself in the new Super Nintendo World overview video below: 


As you can see, the Donkey Kong Mine Cart Madness coaster will feature state-of-the-art track technology that allows it to create the illusion that riders will actually jump off the tracks, just like in the Donkey Kong Country games. 
Like in Hollywood's Super Nintendo World, which does not have the Yoshi's Adventure ride or the Donkey Kong expansion as a result of space at the location, and Osaka's Super Nintendo World, guests can purchase Power-Up Bands to play in interactive Key Challenges to earn coins and more. Plus, returning locations like the Toadstool Cafe restaurant and more will be at Orlando's iteration of the park. 
Here's a look at some of the locations to expect when Universal Epic Universe opens next year: 

For more details about the park, read Game Informer's breakdown of everything coming to Epic Universe next year. After that, check out photos from our visit to Japan's Super Nintendo World, and then watch this vlog of our day at the theme park.

Well, one such map is expanding before my confused idiot eyes, that being Total War: Pharaoh’s. It’s getting a new, distinctly Mesopotamia and Aegea-shaped bit. I believe that’s just south of Eastopotamia and Wegea.

Both of those games, and many others including the recently released No Rest for the Wicked, were published by Private Division, an indie-publishing arm under Take-Two.
Now, in a new update from GamesIndustry.biz, the publication reports that Take-Two has shuttered the "vast majority" of Private Division's teams in Seattle, New York, Las Vegas, and Munich, according to one of its sources. When GamesIndustry.biz reached out to Take-Two for confirmation, the company issued the same statement that can be read in Game Informer's original story below.

Lego has revealed a trio of new sets from its Sonic the Hedgehog range, and oh my Chao, they look pretty spectacular. What's more is that one of them (predictably, the most expensive one) also introduces Super Sonic for the first time.

Last week the Switch 2 beacons were lit once again as Spanish outlet Vandal reported to have more information regarding Nintendo's next hardware, specifically to do with a new, magnetic Joy-Con model.
Another report just days later from the Chinese peripheral manufacturer Mobapad seemed to corroborate this rumour, suggesting that the Joy-Con's current rail system set-up might be a thing of the past once the next console rolls into town (presumably) in 2025.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Medieval city builder Manor Lords was Steam's most-wishlisted game prior to release, and has now managed the feat of transmuting that anticipation into broad enthusiasm and very healthy sales. Not too shabby, considering that it's mostly the work of just one person, Grzegorz Styczeń of Slavic Magic, who has hopefully found time to sleep now and then between fielding bug reports and preparing the game's first patches.
Styczeń understandably doesn't have much time for interviews right now - those troublesome archers aren't going to balance themselves - but yesterday I spoke to Tim Bender, CEO of Manor Lords publisher Hooded Horse, about how Styczeń is getting on. The answer, apparently, is: pretty good, because Styczeń has a healthy approach to early access development in keeping players close, without quite handing them the wheel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remember that bit in that Guy Ritchie film where Dexter Fletcher shoot a guy and then throws a glowing jar over his soldier that summons a bunch of skeletons to help him out? Me too! Must have been the direct influence for Sea Of Thieves' new Season 12, which launched earlier this week with a bang - from two smoking barrels! Among the additions in this season of the ever popular salty sea-dog open-world adventure are double barrel pistols. They deal less damage per shot but have higher rate of fire, and you can charge them up to fire both barrels at once. 
On the other end of the weapon scale are new throwing knives, capable of sneak attacks, light slashes, or, you know, throwing. You can nab any throwing knives you see lying around, too, which is fun. But honestly, the Bone Caller tool (the aforementioned jar of skeletons, which has a great Jason and The Argonauts vibe) and the Horn Of Fair Winds are are probably more useful. The winds from said horn can make your ship go faster, but can also put out fires or crowd control enemies, or for some reason make you swim faster? I don't think that makes sense, to be honest, but the horn has limited uses so as not to make you an unstoppable wind machine.

If only raiding was possible without these things… well, my saviour seems to have arrived in a form I wasn't expecting: 2D anime bunny girls. Rabbit And Steel is a co-op action roguelike that's raiding without the pre-grind and it looks rather wonderful.

That translates to 6€, $6 or £5 for all three main games and 40 DLC packs, plus bells and whistles such as 4K Ultra HD and beefed-up character models. If you haven't played a Mass Effect game before, this is a pretty good place to start.

In the lead-up to the game's release date, the NBA 2K24 developer Visual Concepts released a blog post running down the features of its card-collection mode, MyTeam.

While four mainline entries – Asylum, City, Origins, and Knight – delivered similar gameplay, a smaller spin-off game, 2016's Batman: Arkham VR, let players step into the shoes of the Caped Crusader using their PlayStation VR, Oculus Rift, or HTC Vive headset. Batman: Arkham VR felt more like a tech demo than a fully fleshed-out game, but its relatively high sales showed that the appetite was there. Today, Oculus Studios announced another VR title set in the Batman: Arkham universe titled Batman: Arkham Shadow.

Justin used a large language model to answer questions about the Catholic church and Catholic orthodoxy, and if you have any familiarity with how people love to test AI chatbots - or you read the headline of this article - then you know where this is going. Fr. Justin, who was already kind of controversial anyway, offered the sacrament and claimed to be a real priest to Futurism, and gave the thumbs up to baptising a baby in Gatorade in an emergency.
Catholic Answers (who have the domain Catholic.com; gotta imagine His Holiness wishes he'd moved quicker on that one) then defrocked Justin, making him  a lay theologian in a suit jacket, jeans and an open collar shirt that gives him a "me and my wife saw you across the bar" kind of vibe, when before he had the whole dog collar kit and caboodle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following a report by Game Developer on the ESA’s refusal to budge during a hearing on easing copyright restrictions around academia’s remote access to legacy games, Deus Ex creator Warren Spector has written for the website on his own frustrations with, and efforts to aid, game preservation. Channeling some of the classic immersive sim resourcefulness he helped pioneer, he writes that he’s “literally dumpster dived to retrieve information other developers have simply thrown away, believing it to be worthless.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday, coinciding with the release of the Thrones of Decay DLC, Total War: Warhammer 3 jumped 90 places in the Steam charts, trailed closely by the three lord packs that make up the strategy game's latest expansion. Those lord packs are now the three top rated expansions in the series’ history, and the base game itself saw a huge uptick in positive reviews. The last day also saw a peak player count of around 66,000, putting it ahead of giants like Palworld, Rimworld, and Fallout 76. None of this would be especially notable, however, if this wasn’t a complete turnaround from how things have been for the best part of a year now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A player-run troupe of actors will be performing an adaptation of Richard III in Fallout 76, featuring a "ghoul" in the lead role. They're partly inspired by the recent Fallout TV show, which puts a jaded cowboy ghoul in a pivotal role and has led to an increase in players of the online multiplayer RPG. This production will likely be more faithful to the bard than to Amazon Prime. It will open with the line: "Now is the nuclear winter of our discontent."

Not only has it gifted us details on the new mission type and the new season event, it's also given us an idea of when we might see Season 6 emerge. I suppose you could liken the stream to a bushy Dwarven beard, from which the devs pluck out announcements like it's show and tell. And the show and tell is set in a dingy mine. And there are multiple pints involved.

Step forward Mini Settlers, which has a free prologue version you might try if you're weary of Manor Lording, or you've already exhausted the play possibilities of early access Franconia.

The CJEU's judgment leaves no stone unturned explaining why that isn't so, leaving case law to deal with the turbulence.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zynga has released a new trailer for its upcoming competitive multiplayer game, Star Wars: Hunters, revealing a June 4 release date alongside a new cinematic look at some of the characters. Star Wars: Hunters will hit Switch and iOS and Android devices on that day, giving players the chance to compete with others in iconic locations like the forest moon of Endor, the icy planet of Hoth, and elsewhere while controlling Hunters like J-3DI, a droid who thinks he's a Jedi, Utooni which is two Jawas stacked on top of each other in a trench coat, and more. 
Zynga says each Hunter boasts their own unique set of abilities to aid them in the Arena, which is the marquee attraction of the new planet of Vespaara. "Star Wars: Hunters features a number of game modes for players to test their mettle, such as Squad Brawl, in which opposing teams will battle to rack up the most eliminations, and Trophy Chase, where competing teams will vie for control of the elusive droid TR-F33," a press release reads. 
Check out the action in the new Star Wars: Hunters trailer below: 


"We are beyond excited to welcome fans across the globe to Vespaara," Zynga vice president Sam Cooper writes in a press release. "We can't wait for gamers to meet our Hunters and hop into the Arena. There are so many fun twists and winks to recognizable, beloved Star Wars settings, creatures, and themes within our game that we also are eager to see players worldwide get the chance to discover." 
Star Wars: Hunters will be available worldwide on Switch, iOS, and Android devices. It will be free, and on Switch, it does not require a Nintendo Switch Online membership to download and play.

If you're a fan of a popular movie or TV show from any time in the last several decades, chances are, they've made a Funko Pop figurine of the main characters. The brand is ubiquitous in pop culture, so it was only a matter of time before it got a big video game adaptation. This sort of game could easily be a cheap cash grab, but after watching a preview demo and listening to one of the head developers speak about it, I'm confident that Funko Fusion is much more than that.
You've never played a game by developer 10:10 Games, but you probably know the work of its staff – the founders of the studio are some of the former architects of the Lego games developed…]]></summary>

Sure, I spent some time with the new stuff, but really, I spent most of my time being absolutely demolished in turn-based battles against various demons of a phallic and non-phallic nature. I will now attempt to summarise my time against these creatures, wish me luck.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Razer, makers of various pretty good gaming peripherals and one deeply questionable face mask, have been slapped with a $1.1 million fine by US regulators after said mask was determined to have misled buyers over the amount of protection it afforded. Kotaku reports that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) took issue with Razer’s claim that the Zephyr, an RGB monstrosity released during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, could act as a medical-grade N95 respirator – it could not – and will allocate $1 million of that fine towards refunds for fooled, if colourfully illuminated, buyers.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/04/30/square-enix-has-seemingly-canceled-some-games-in-an-effort-to-be-more-selective-and"/>
        <updated>2024-04-30T14:05:08.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enix, the company behind last year's Final Fantasy XVI and this year's Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, has seemingly canceled some in-development games, taking on some big losses as a result. As for why, the company is aiming to be more selective about its projects moving forward. 
This news comes from a release related to Square Enix's holdings, which explains the company is incurring losses of 22.1 billion Yen, or roughly $140 million, on its financial books for the fiscal year that ended in March. 


"At the meeting convened on March 27, 2024, the Board of Directors of Square Enix Holdings voted, in light of the myriad changes underway in the environment surrounding its group, to revise the group's approach to the development of high-definition (HD) games with the intention of being more selective and focused in the allocation of development resources," the release reads. "As a result of a close examination, the company expects to recognize approximately 22.1 billion Yen in content abandonment losses on its books for the fiscal year ended March 2024." 
While potentially canceled games might sound doom and gloom, it sounds more like Square Enix is sharpening its developmental focus to ensure that the games it releases are hits or, at the very least, financially successful for the company. Nonetheless, it sounds like roughly $140 million of games in development have been canceled and it's unlikely we'll ever find out what they were. 
This release comes after a big splash from Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, which Square Enix released in February. Elsehwere in 2024, Square Enix is releasing Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail, the new expansion for the MMO that will kick off a new saga for the long-running game, in July.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I once went back to a gathering after a friend-of-a-friend’s metal gig that I distinctly remember not because of either the party or the show, but because we drunkenly went to a big Tesco afterwards to get snacks. I also distinctly remember making a not-completely serious but also somewhat true statement at the party about how that Tesco trip was the most fun I’d had in months, after which one of the metal men sneered at me. I felt self conscious at the time, but I’ve since grown comfortable enough with myself to realise that the metal man was a joyless fool, and going to big supermarkets is at least as fun as going to average metal gigs. There is nothing a drop D power chord can evoke in me that compares to the feeling of blurrily espying a chocolate trifle in the reduced to clear section. So I wish to bring your attention to Supermarket Times.

        <updated>2024-04-30T14:00:20.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Harold Halibut has the vibes of a game that should be 4-6 hours long and is, inexplicably, 10-12. It's inexplicable not only because it's a slow game low on interaction - the game is really just a plot delivery mechanism; a TV show you can walk around where you advance the story by pressing A - but also because it's a game created using handmade miniatures. It's a sci-fi animated dolls house under the sea, self described as "a cross between a game and a stop motion film", and if my game required that amount of labour I'd edit that script down. Then again, there aren't that many locations, so maybe you'd really want to show them off.
I love miniatures, and Harold Halibut is beautiful. It's also a lovely story about finding yourself and your place in the world, even if that place is unexpected, and having the courage to take that step. There are unexpected silly bits and strange bits and bits where people break into song, and bits where you read undelivered letters. But, at the same time, I totally understand why some people would find it boring.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/04/30/housemarque-celebrates-returnals-3-year-anniversary-with-fallen-asteria-animated"/>
        <updated>2024-04-30T13:46:01.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Housemarque is celebrating the three-year anniversary of its hit shooter roguelike Returnal by teaming up with Dark Horse Comics for a graphic novel, artbook, and a new animated adaptation you can watch right now. This news follows yesterday's tease from both Housemarque and later Dark Horse Comics about Returnal, sending fans into an understandable frenzy about what the teams had in store for players. 
"Another year, another cycle," a post on X (formerly Twitter) from Housemarque reads. "The Third time around, extra loot is exposed with Dark Horse flair." 
Here's what that flair brings to the Returnal universe: 
Returnal: Fallen Asteria Graphic Novel
Returnal Artbook
Fallen Asteria Animated Adaptation
Now, even with PlayStation dipping its toes into cross-media production with Amazon's God of War series and Netflix's Horizon adaptation, this Returnal adaptation isn't the same. Instead, it's an "animated version of the first issue of the upcoming graphic novel, Returnal: Fallen Asteria." Check it out for yourself below: 


Housemarque says the 88-page graphic novel will arrive in paperback on bookstore shelves starting October 22, 2024, and it will hit comic book shops the next day. 
It's unclear if the animated adaptation above is the animated adaptation today's announcement refers to or if it's just the first part of it since it only adapts the first issue of the graphic novel. 
Here's a look at the Returnal: Fallen Asteria issues coming this October: 
There's no word on when the Returnal artbook will arrive, but presumably it's this year. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Returnal review, and then check out this story about the PC specs required to play Returnal on a desktop or laptop. After that, read about Returnal's Ascension update, which added co-op gameplay and a new challenge tower to the game. 
Returnal hit PlayStation 5 on April 30, 2021. It launched on PC on February 15, 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starfield's first expansion, Shattered Space, is set to arrive this fall, according to director Todd Howard. Plus, a new update for Starfield is coming later this week that will make changes to ship-building mechanics and more. 
Howard revealed this and more about Starfield in a new interview with Kinda Funny, which is where the Bethesda executive producer also discussed Amazon's Fallout TV show and the Fallout series in general, as reported by XboxEra. As for what to expect of Shattered Space, Howard didn't say much. However, we already know it will bring new story content, locations, gear, and more to Starfield. 


As noted by XboxEra, Shattered Space will be free for all Starfield Deluxe Edition owners. 
As for the update coming to Starfield later this week, Howard says it will focus on the ship-building. This lines up with what the Starfield team shared last year in its 2024 plans for the game. Here's what it said at the time: "For those who love ship building, we'll also be expanding on ship customization with ship decorations, new ship building options, and more."
Other updates scheduled for 2024 include new ways to travel, city maps, mod support, accessibility and additional difficulty options, and more. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Starfield review, and then read about how Starfield is surprisingly great as a remote-play game. After that, check out this story about how Starfield is more like a sci-fi theme park than an open world adventure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wow, remember Starfield? I do, just about, although any interest in it feels like a distant dream now. But not to Todd Howard! The Bethesboss had a chat with Kinda Funny and confirmed that Shattered Space, the first big DLC for the brave little space RPG that could, has a release window of "in the fall". Shattered Space adds new locations and stories and gear, and is the sort of DLC that was announced before the game came out, and you got it bundled with some of the super mega hyper awesome pre-order editions (you can still get it bundled with the Starfield Premium Edition if you want to spend an extra 30 quid). 
Before that, though, Howard says we should expect (via VGC via the video) "a big update that's coming really soon", and that "we redid the map stuff, so we have some city map stuff." This is the literal first thing I complained about when I reviewed Starfield. Vindication! This is one of a number of changes teased on Starfield's Reddit community at the end of last year.

The second, a reseller in the astrology business, just had his case suddenly dismissed. Nobody could've predicted that.

The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were synonymous with gaming in the late ‘80s and early ‘90s, largely thanks to their influence over arcade brawlers. Games like 1989’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (also known as ’89 Arcade) and 1991’s Turtles in Time are time-honored classics that shaped the side-scrolling beat-‘em-up genre, and 2022’s Shredder’s Revenge demonstrated that the style is still viable in the modern landscape.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Jackbox Party Packs have always allowed for adult-themed responses, but it was never solicited or directly encouraged by the games themselves. For those who have wanted a more mature experience, Jackbox Games is finally granting you your wish, as it has announced Jackbox Naughty Pack, a new release of three games that promises spicy prompts and dirty fun later this year.
We don't know what kinds of games will be included, but Jackbox Games teases "spicy surprises and maybe even some familiar faces." Does that tease a new, mature-themed You Don't Know Jack? Will we get dirtier iterations on some classic Jackbox titles? Or will these be all new games that just so happen to include some favorite characters from past games? Unfortunately, for now, Jackbox Games is being tight-lipped with the contents of Jackbox Naughty Pack.
However, the studio did release a teaser trailer, which you can view right here. Jackbox Naughty Pack will arrive sometime this year, and Jackbox Games promises more details this summer.
Are you excited for a spicier take on Jackbox Party Pack? Do you and the people you play Jackbox games with typically go mature-themed with your answers, or are you more of a family-friendly Jackbox gamer? Let us know what you hope from Jackbox Naughty Pack in the comments below!]]></summary>

This follows a boisterous opening weekend that has seen the new city builder top purchase charts on Steam, causing Valve's mighty servers to crumble under the strain like overloaded oxen.

In addition to painting the overall financial health of the studio, the report shares details on the current development state of Control 2, Max Payne 1&2 Remake, the Control multiplayer spin-off Codename Condor, and more.
According to the report, the Control 2 team is “focused on finalizing the proof-of-concept stage, in which the game world, game mechanics and visual targets are proven.” The project is expected to move into the production readiness stage in Q2 of this year. Control 2 was first announced in 2022.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Distinguishing one metroidvania from another is a dicey challenge, and not just because there's a 37.8% chance that saying the word "metroidvania" will cause RPS regular Sin Vega to materialise in the mirror and assassinate you with cheesewire. Metroidvanias stand apart for me only in hindsight - it's all about the precise ratio of abilities to ability gates, of jump-doublers to overhangs, all things that take time to assess properly. Echo Weaver sets itself apart early, however, by declaring that "time is your currency" and that "when faced with eternity, knowledge is the only gear you need", a phrase that, admittedly, I would probably have extended to "...oh, and a spacetime-folding glaive that works like a throwable fast travel point".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Housemarque, the developer of titles such as Returnal and Resogun, has teased some kind of announcement for tomorrow. 
In a post on X, the developer simply posted a graphic of what appears to be a fractured reflection of a woman’s eyes with the word “Tomorrow.”

Less than two hours later, Housemarque shared a brief video clip of the same image but in animated form.

April 29, 2024
While the kneejerk reaction is to assume this announcement is related to Returnal, be it a sequel or something else, that seems unlikely. In 2022, Housemarque stated it was developing a new IP for its next title. However, that wouldn't necessarily rule out the possibility of more Returnal DLC, if nothing else. Much has changed for Housemarque since Returnal launched in April 2021, such as being acquired by Sony just a couple of months later. Returnal launched on PC in February 2023 and has been updated with additional content and features such as co-op. 
Thankfully, we don’t have to wait long to learn what Housemarque has up its sleeve next. In the meantime, be sure to check out our review of Returnal here.]]></summary>

This will be the studio's next original game, after they wrapped up Layers Of Fear last year with, confusingly, Layers Of Fear (the natural progression for a series: Layers Of Fear, Layers Of Fear 2, and then Layers Of Fear again, although it was going to be called Layers Of Fears at one point).
Bloober Team are currently doing a lot of IP work for other people, with the Silent Hill 2 remake due out later this year, and a game codenamed "Project R" in concert with Skybound Entertainment. Skybound are The Walking Dead company, so I wouldn't give you long odds for a bet on what Project R is about. Neither would I be surprised if Project C is unveiled this summer by a man named Geoff with shiny shiny trainers. I'm interested to see what it is, and honestly I'm hoping it's a brand new standalone thing, rather than a forced sequel to Observer or 2021's The Medium (where I got the header).

And yes, we’re only hearing about this a mere month after the last big Amazon discount splurge, Spring Deal Days. My life is a calendar where every square has "deals" written on it in increasingly scratchy Biro.
Still, let’s keep it summery, eh? Prime Day 2024 may not be a surprise (and is still lacking a specific launch date), but unless the US government announces a second June-based Black Friday or something, it likely represents the next mass serving of PC gaming deals for you to take advantage of. SSDs, graphics cards, or anything else that’s been unusually pricey lately are all but guaranteed to get slashed back down, so there are definitely worse times to be in the market for an upgrade than Prime Day.

The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass released in 2007 for DS and is controlled entirely by touchscreen. Back in 2017 while speaking with longtime Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma for our Breath of the Wild cover story, he cited Phantom Hourglass as his personal favorite Zelda game saying that his wife is a fan of that entry, and it was the first time he was in the role of producer. "I have a lot of sentiment for it,"Aonuma said.
Check out the video below for an hour Phantom Hourglass gameplay below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A collection of five Phoenix Wright games - including some of the greatest visual novels of all time, in my opinion - is about to be discontinued on Steam, making it slightly less convenient to pick up the original Ace Attorney trilogy and its recent prequel games. That’s the bad news. The good news is you’ve got a month’s notice - and it’s on sale for the next week or so.

        <link href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/04/26/blizzard-announces-its-skipping-blizzcon-this-year"/>
        <updated>2024-04-26T17:04:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blizzard has decided to cancel this year’s BlizzCon. The company states the event will return in the future, but it plans to showcase upcoming games in a different manner over the coming months. 
First announced in a blog post, Blizzard plans to share details on upcoming games like World of Warcraft: The War Within and Diablo IV’s Vessel of Hatred expansion at other trade shows, such as Gamescom. The company also plans to launch “multiple, global, in-person events” for Warcraft’s 30th anniversary, which are described as being “distinct” from BlizzCon. 
“Our hope is that these experiences – alongside several live-streamed industry events where we’ll keep you up to date with what’s happening in our game universes – will capture the essence of what makes the Blizzard community so special,” Blizzard states in the blog post.
A Blizzard representative tells Windows Central that Blizzard made the call to cancel BlizzCon and not Microsoft, which completed its acquisition of the company last year. In a statement to the outlet, the representative says, “This is a Blizzard decision. We have explored different event formats in the past, and this isn't the first time we're skipping BlizzCon or trying something new. While we have great things to share in 2024, the timing just doesn’t line up for one single event at the end of the year.”
BlizzCon began in 2005 as an annual convention celebrating all things Blizzard. Last year's show saw the reveal of World of Warcraft’s next expansion, The War Within, as well as two other expansions coming after it. It's good that event is only taking a year off as opposed to being canned for good, and we're curious to see how the alternative events shape up over the coming months.]]></summary>

Oh, and top of that it’s about rebelling against capitalism via oyster farming - and it’s made by a real-life oyster farmer. Let’s get into this package of joys.

It was Steam's most wishlisted game before launch, and it's so popular right now that Steam's servers are struggling to keep up: there's an official developer post on the game's Steam forum warning that "the store is overwhelmed from all the people buying, it may take a couple tries for a bit while things calm down".

A helicopter will soon join the fray. Many things will soon explode, and you will take a short break from the minigunning to calmly physics some boxes into a set of steps with a crane. This FPS is not so much writing a love letter to a bygone era of noughties shooters, as it is standing underneath the window of its respected elders earnestly serenading them with a busted old keytar from the attic. There are bum notes and the singing voice is not exactly boy-band beautiful, but the love is unmistakably there. And, hey, singing is hard.

And by people, I mean oxen.

I’m starting to fear, actually, that this one icon of a behatted japester may have been widely adopted as an oddly hostile way to single out dissenting opinions, rapidly accelerating the Steam reviews’ grisly metamorphosis into something that more resembles a clout-farming social app than anything with pretensions towards facilitating helpfulness or self expression.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lethal Company is a fun game but I know what you're thinking: it lacks feline energy. Whilst the simplistic game loop of collecting scrap on monster-infested moons and selling it to an equally monstrous company is enjoyable at first, it can get old pretty fast. As both Alice and James have attested with their experiences of this month's RPS Game Club pick, Lethal Company is a game that lacks a certain direction the more you play. I soon found myself settling into an existential crisis, reminiscent of my tumultuous stint in retail. A recurring thought back then was why bother stacking shelves, only to have someone buy the products and make me re-stack them again?
In the vain hopes of gaining a higher purpose in Lethal Company, I stumbled across the 'Needy Cats' mod. Essentially this mod adds a variety of cats to your game that will wander around the facilities and yelp for attention.
Perhaps I'm just a glutton for heartbreak, but I decided that the game needed a galactic sanctuary full of adorable balls of floof. I hearkened back to my time playing Stray, the adorable cat adventure set in a post-apocalypse where humanity was all but wiped out. Could this be the prequel to Lethal Company? What if all Apocalypse games share the same universe, all orchestrated by The Company secretly pulling the strings of fate? Or maybe I just wanted to look at cute cats instead of terrifying mannequin monsters. Either way, the cats needed help. What follows is a diary log of my adventures which soon lead to increasing madness and ultimately, disaster.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Great was the consternation of singleplayer horror likers at the popularity of Lethal Company, a landmark creepfest and satire of corporate piecework that is best enjoyed in groups of four. When will developer Zeekerss give us a proper singleplayer campaign mode, the loners of the gaming community wondered, peering from their boltholes and eyries. A Lethal Sole Trader, as it were - or failing that, how about some bot support? Well, this particular monkeypaw finger has curled. It curled about four years ago, actually, when Zeekerss released singleplayer-only horror compilation It Steals. 


I've been playing It Steals (available on Itch and Steam for £4 or $5) as part of our latest Lethal Company-dedicated Game Club, and let me tell you, it makes Lethal Company look positively, er, Nonlethal. There are many points of comparison between games, but while Lethal Company is geared more obviously for laughs, with its whoopie cushions and ReactionTube-friendly co-op mechanics, It Creeps just wants to scare you shitless. It's also brilliant.

This is true! It's also janky, and the RNG on the weird, warren-like buildings prompted me to ask "Who designed this? What is this for? What kind of office is this??" out loud, as I faced yet another dead end full of pipes. And yet! There's something about it that endears me to it far more than other similar games like Phasmophobia. Games like this all largely rely on you making your own fun with the tools they provide, but I think we should give the Lethal Company devs props for their tools, because they are weird and make no sense, and allow for some fantastic slapstick.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Escape From Tarkov, the extraction FPS from developer Battlestate, recently put up a new Unheard edition of the game for pre-order, and tarkov escapers aren't happy about it. The price for this bundle - which includes a new mode, a bigger stash, and assorted gubbins - comes in at $250, or around two actual hundred actual pounds, but the price alone isn’t necessarily what’s got a section of the player base so tarked-off that a few of them are even loudly considering a lawsuit. 

The actual issue is twofold: the edition is being called pay-to-win, and is also the only way to access said new PvE co-op mode, despite players previously shelling out notable nuggets for what was pitched as access to "all subsequent DLCs" as part of the now-delisted Edge of Darkness edition.

What began as rumors of a Nintendo DMCA takedown campaign, suddenly shifted towards a 'fake notice' campaign, run from a suspicious domain. Frustrations then targeted Garry himself for "falling for a scam." "You didn't even look at the domain!" yelled one fan. Let's do that.

Developer Shift Up does a good job of gradually introducing new core systems as you move through the lengthy adventure, but as we played ahead of public launch, our team discovered several things the game doesn’t tell you that can lead to a more enjoyable journey.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon's Dogma 2 launched a little over a month ago and has already managed to sell 2.5 million copies, but Capcom is still releasing updates to patch minor issues with the game. While a large volume of complaints have been about the lack of a performance mode, this update (like the last update) does not address that issue. However, it does aim to clean up a number of irritating errors involving the behavior of pawns, the player's AI companions.
An update for Dragon's Dogma 2 is now live on all platforms!
https://t.co/waEdG0ntSv
April 25, 2024
For starters, this update makes it easier to detect dragonsplague, an affliction that, if untreated, can lead to devastating consequences for your pawns and your world. It's also contagious, so it's a good idea to nip it in the bud as soon as you first encounter it. When afflicted, pawns' eyes will glow red – after this update, they'll glow more noticeably. The update also causes the disease to infect pawns less frequently.
Pawns should also be a lot less annoying now, thanks to a whole slate of minor refinements to their behavior. They'll jump off cliffs less often (which is hilarious but a wild inconvenience), say some lines less often, say other lines at more appropriate times and become less likely to offer to be hired while passing by on the street. They're one of the highlights of the game, so anything done to make their constant presence more consistent is always welcome.
There are also smaller adjustments, like adding the ability to zoom in on a character's face in shops, preventing monster attacks in town from leading to the player's arrest, and other miscellaneous bug fixes. You can read the full list of updates, as well as all past updates, here.]]></summary>

This time we spoke to him (through a translator) about inspirations for the game beyond Nier Automata (like the Bible and The Matrix), the approach to costumes and how they fit in the lore, and why having no minimaps in the game was a purposeful decision.

A fork acts as your defacto sword, while various other remnants from above, like shot glasses, soda cans, and more, serve as your shield. With fork in hand and can on back, Kril, a shy but easygoing hermit crab, sets out into the aquatic kingdom to find his favorite shell, stolen from him by a loan shark tax collector.

Sand Land is experiencing an oddly timed resurgence. Its creator, Akira Toriyama (Dragon Ball), recently passed away unexpectedly, effectively pointing a spotlight on his 24-year-old creation just as it was being adapted to film, anime, and video game. The video game has been my entry point into this world with characters, vehicles, and architecture that all resemble Dragon Ball beyond even just an art style, and I enjoyed the opportunity to live in a brand new Toriyama world and story. Other elements of the game, like its …]]></summary>

After a long absence, the Super Monkey Ball series returned in 2019 and 2021 with remasters and remakes of previous games, but it's been over a decade since fans received an all-new Super Monkey Ball title. That changes in June, as Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble is poised to deliver the continuation longtime players pine for. But with some recent mixed results, massive changes in game design best practices in the time since the series' heyday, and likely a whole lot of cobwebs to shake off for developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, I was skeptical about the viability of a new Super Monkey Ball in 2024.…]]></summary>

The June 2023 reveal of Star Wars Outlaws gave us our first glimpse of Kay Vess and Nix, the two protagonists of the game. From talking with Massive Entertainment during our recent trip out to Sweden to get our hands on Star Wars Outlaws, it sounds as though their bond will be special. However, they aren't on this journey alone, as they are joined by a trenchcoat-wearing BX-commando droid named ND-5. Though Kay and Nix were greater points of emphasis during our studio visit, we had to ask the developers about the internet-popular droid that joins the Star Wars Outlaws adventure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Taming a wolf in Minecraft is one of the game's simplest joys, and no matter how many times I start a new world, I always hoard bones in case I encounter one. But once you've adopted a canine companion, you probably hide them away in a house for safe-keeping, shielding them from the horrors of the game's hostile mobs. Today, Minecraft is adding a way to make them a little stronger – wolf armor.


Like leather armor, wolf armor can be colored using dyes in-game, so if you've got multiple adopted animals, it'll still be easy to tell them apart. This variation is separate from the collar colors as well, creating plenty of possibilities. Even better, the game is also adding wolf fur variants for the first time, bringing eight new patterns for a total of nine. Each variant (Pale, Woods, Ashen, Black, chestnut, Rusty, Spotted, Striped, and Snowy) spawns in a specific biome. You can take a look at all the new breeds in the gallery below.

Of course, players will need to be able to craft this wolf armor as well, which is where the new mob, the armadillo, comes in. These armored relatives of anteaters can be found in savannah or badland biomes, where they can be seen strolling around and curling into a defensive ball when certain enemies come near. Armadillos drop armadillo scutes, which are used to make the wolf armor, but the developers have reassured players that they can be brushed rather than defeated, so you won't have to go on an armadillo massacre to protect your pets. Armadillos can also be used to scare away spiders since they eat insects and arachnids in real life, and spider eyes can be used to breed them if you want to make your own armadillo farm.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Epic Games has revealed a new setting for Fortnite that allows players to hide emotes the company considers "confrontational." This doesn't outright ban these emotes from the game and those with them can still use them, but if someone has this new setting turned off, they won't see others use them. 
Called "See Confrontational Emotes," players can choose whether they want to see emotes like "Laugh It Up," "Take the L," "Whipcrack," and "Make It Plantain" from anyone, from friends in a party, or never. Epic says players who have these emotes hidden with this new setting will see a player using the emote standing still, with no emote sound. 
This new setting can be found under "Social Privacy" in the Fortnite settings and it defaults to only show these confrontational emotes from friends in your party. Epic stresses that this setting does not change a player's ability to use any emotes. It is now live in-game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Publisher Atlus and developer Studio Zero have released a new trailer for the upcoming fantasy RPG, Metaphor: ReFantazio, and it features plenty of new gameplay. It also reveals Metaphor: ReFantazio will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on October 11. 
Dubbed "The King's Trial," this new trailer sets up a bit of the Metaphor: ReFantazio's world more, highlighting a tournament for the king's throne at the center of the narrative. It seems our protagonist and the friends and allies they encounter along the way are vying for a crown that others are also after. In order to claim it, players must complete trials across the lands, proving their worth. 
Check it out for yourself in the Metaphor: ReFantazio gameplay trailer below: 


As you can see, Metaphor: ReFantazio continues to look excellent, with its Persona inspirations on full display. That's not surprising, though, considering Studio Zero is composed of various leads from Atlus' popular Persona series, including the latest in the franchise, Persona 5. 
If you've played Persona 5 Royal, or even the recently released Persona 3 Reload, then you know we're likely in for a treat when it comes to a few things: combat, narrative, and art. And if this new look at the game's menu are any indication, the Persona team has been cooking something special for Metaphor: ReFantazio. 
The trailer also reveals Metaphor: ReFantazio will get a special Collector's Edition for $149.99. The game's standard release will cost $69.99.
Here's what the Collector's Edition looks like: 
Metaphor: ReFantazio hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on October 11, 2024. 
For more about the game, watch the Metaphor: ReFantazio reveal trailer. Read Game Informer's Persona 5 Royal review, and then read Game Informer's Persona 5 Tactica review after that.

The latest of these artists is Billie Eilish, who announced her collaboration with the game on social media earlier today.

April 22, 2024
Eilish is not just getting a skin added to the game (like Eminem, for example), she's the next headliner for Fortnite Festival's main stage event, which will start tomorrow, April 23. This includes a set of artist-specific rotating songs players can compete for high scores in, as well as unlockable skins, songs, instruments, and other cosmetics, though unlocking all of these requires the purchase of the pricey 1,800 V-Buck Festival Pass. Previous headliners were The Weeknd and Lady Gaga.
Eilish recently made headlines for winning a Grammy, Golden Globe, and Oscar for "What Was I Made For" from the Barbie movie, which is a task she's now accomplished twice. Even more recently, she announced her upcoming album Hit Me Hard And Soft, which is likely her main marketing incentive for appearing in the game.

They've also given a heads-up on some games we can expect to see. Vampire Survivors, which cracked our top ten games of the year back in 2022, has been on the platform for some time now, but recently announced a new expansion featuring weapons and characters from the Contra series. Dungeons of Hinterberg is an action-adventure title announced at SGF last year that we got a chance to preview. The showcase will also spotlight co-op roguelike 33 Immortals and Don't Nod's upcoming adventure title, Lost Records: Bloom & Rage.
For more context, last year's version of this event included over 20 games, including Sea of Stars, Karateka, and Vampire Survivors again, somehow. Regardless of whether or not it appears, you can bet the comment section will be flooded with Hollow Knight: Silksong fans clamoring for the game, which we haven't seen since the Xbox summer showcase in 2022 when it was announced the game would come to Game Pass on day one.
You can watch the showcase next week on IGN's YouTube channel. The showcase will also be available in American Sign Language.

In Tales of Kenzera: Zau, the debut game from Surgent Studios, the use of the word "Tales" is more literal than it initially seems. To kick off the events of the game, protagonist Zuberi reads a book written by his late father about a place called Kenzera. He uses fiction to cope with his grief, just as the player might do with the plot of the game, and as the studio founder, who lost his father as well, did when creating the story to begin with.

As such, Embracer Group as we know it will be no more; instead, it will largely consist of Asmodee, Coffee Stain & Friends, and Middle-earth Enterprises & Friends. 
Each of these companies will be run individually and traded publicly in the market, with IP and franchises under the Embracer Group umbrella spread across them. This separation follows a rocky period for Embracer Group, which is behind layoffs at companies like Black Forest Games and Eidos-Montréal after a planned $2 billion deal with Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group fell through in 2023.

One of the highlights of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was Knuckles, voiced by Idris Elba. The fish-out-of-water gags and his strict adherence to the echidna warrior code, which is in stark contrast to Sonic's fun-loving personality, made for an enjoyable dynamic within the cast of characters. Knuckles, the new six-episode streaming show on Paramount Plus, tries to carry forward that dynamic. However, thanks to low stakes, a palpable disconnect from the larger Sonic story, and too much emphasis on the human characters in the world, it falls short of the heights reached by the two theatrical films.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Total Eclipse, a real-time, curse-breaking, 3D adventure (with a dash of Indiana Jones flair), is ready for public testing!
Originally unleashed by Incentive Software Ltd. in 1988, Total Eclipse added yet another groundbreaking title to their repertoire of revolutionary games.
Step into the shoes of a heroic archeologist on October 26, 1930, as a total solar eclipse akin to the one happening today over North America looms over Cairo. Knowing of the Ardognus prophecy, created by the powerful high priest Hahmid III, you must find and destroy the hidden shrine devoted to Ra before the eclipse occurs.
Embark on this exciting journey packed with a trusty gun for blasting through doors or dispatching undead mummies; a compass to guide you through a treacherous pyramid; a wristwatch to track the precious time left; and a water bottle to fight dehydration (you’re only human after all). 
Can you solve this ancient mystery within 120 minutes and avert catastrophe, or will Rah's wrath obliterate the moon?
Our modern reimplementation of the Freescape engine features graphics using hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Total Eclipse support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum, and Amstrad CPC. More releases are coming at a later date. Additionally, there are three playable demos if you want to test the game. Please contact us if you have some other release or demo.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.
