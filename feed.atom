Shared on Steam by the developers (thanks, Nintendo Everything), many of these changes are for the PC version of the game, though others are for all console versions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[And what will be left of them?
Supermassive Games is gearing up for the launch of The Devil in Me, the fourth and final episode in the first season of its scary, (and highly enjoyable) anthology series, The Dark Pictures. Publisher Bandai Namco released a new trailer, focusing on the hapless folk treading, foolhardily, into The Curator's world.
The Dark Pictures: The Devil in Me will tell a tale of a party of documentary makers who find themselves invited to a modern replica of the "The Murder Castle" — the opulent estate of America's first publicized serial killer H. H. Holmes. Seeing this as the opportunity to make the ultimate true crime document, our young protagonists jump at the opportunity, unaware of the horrifying, twisted plans that lay in store...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUcFLkAZmyo
The trailer introduces heroes Charlie, Kate, Mark, Jamie, and Erin, with quick glimpses offered of a mysterious, cloaked killer and, of course, The Curator himself. Of all The Dark Pictures titles to date, The Devil in Me looks set to be the most "slasher" based, perhaps eschewing the supernatural and/or monster-based terror of its predecessors. Horror fans will also spot numerous familiar themes and references, from a Shining-esque bar and a Tourist Trap range of animatronics, to Saw-style "death traps" and the Giallo overtones of the villain themselves.
The Devil in Me will represent the culmination of The Dark Pictures' first season, which has bombarded us with a frenzied party of pain and jump-scares over the past four years. Still, with a whole host of previously trademarked titles, and sales still riding relatively high, we can be sure that there are many more thrills and spills currently in the works within the gleefully grotesque minds of Supermassive Games.
The Dark Pictures: The Devil in Me launches November 18 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

Netflix Games, in association with developer Tender Claws, has announced that it will be adapting its hugely popular horror series, Stranger Things, for the VR platform. According to the publisher Stranger Things VR will launch in the winter of 2023 for all "major VR platforms".
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQnFM5X5XQM
Perhaps surprisingly, players will actually take up the role of Vecna — the antagonist of the show's fourth season — as they attempt to wreak havoc and vengeance on both the town of Hawkins and, in particular, its powerful psychic savior, Eleven. Stranger Things VR will see Vecna, (and by proxy, the player) invade multiple worlds, conjure up terrifying and vivid nightmares, and engage in reality-shattering psychological warfare.
In many ways, Stranger Things is custom designed for virtual reality, given its "no rules" approach to the simple act of physical existence. While VR, for many, remains little more than a somewhat interactable rollercoaster ride/ghost train, it is a medium that perfectly suits franchises that focus on the strange, the bizarre, and the warped. And, as such, fans of The Upside Down and its occupants would likely have a real thrill ride exploring its mind-bending themes and aesthetic in fully immersive 3D action.

Well, a new Stranger Things VR game that mixes psychological horror with action is coming from creative studio Tender Claws in 2023, and it casts you as telekinetic monstrosity Vecna. The game’s been commissioned by Netflix, with the series writers involved in creating it. I’m not sure exactly how involved they are, but the trailer is suitably Stranger Things enough that it’s not that big a deal if they just looked at it and went “Yes, fine.” You can watch it for yourself below.

And it tones down the pace of movement too, making for a measured experience that certainly rewards speed, but doesn't make it an athletics competition.
And while the game's multiplayer is a slick refinement of what's come before, its gun unlock process is messy and excessive, even if it offers plenty of options for all types of player. Oh, and make sure you've got the game installed on an SSD...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Roaming Gimmighouls are in Go early, too
Pokemon Go and Scarlet/Violet connectivity is confirmed by way of a tweet from the official Pokemon Twitter account, which asks players to "stay by for future announcements."
Interestingly, a new Pokemon has been shown off as a result of this collaboration. It's called "Gimmighoul," and follows a long line of mythological tricksters that are focused around coins/gold/wealth.  Gimmighoul takes on a "chest form" in Scarlet and Violet, and functions a lot like a Mimic treasure chest in many other forms of fantasy media. But it also sports a "roaming form," which is live in Pokemon Go now.
Here's a breakdown:
"Research conducted by Professor Willow and Jacq, a biology teacher from the Paldea region, confirms that Trainers have spotted Gimmighoul in its Roaming Form. Further, there’s another form in the Paldea region called Chest Form Gimmighoul."

We also get a reconfirmation that Pokemon Home support is still planned for Scarlet and Violet after launch. Right at 5:01 in the below video at the bottom of the screen, you'll see that Scarlet/Violet connectivity "is expected to be added to Pokemon Home after the game's release." Future announcements will come at a later date.
While Pokemon connectivity is often rolled out haphazardly or late, it's nice to know that it's coming at some point.

After literal years of waiting, Bayonetta 3 finally launched for the Nintendo Switch at the end of October. For many, the game stands as one of the finest action titles every released and builds on what the first two games accomplished with their respective gameplay mechanics.
According to Imran Khan (former Senior Editor at Game Informer), however, the game was originally planned to be much broader in scope when compared to the final product, and was supposedly meant to be open-world. Khan states that the design would draw inspiration from PlatinumGames' previous Switch title Astral Chain and would feature an open-world hub world from which Bayonetta would visit various locations:

It may come as no surprise that we here at Nintendo Life love the Switch. Did it manage to solve problems with portability that we didn't even know we had? Yes it did. Did it bring everyone back round to Nintendo when the Wii U had managed to do otherwise? You betcha. Is Joy-Con drift rapidly becoming the bane of our lives. Well, yeah kinda. Fortunately, we've made a video which addresses just that.
That's right, drift is still a problem, and we are still upset about it. There is no Switch issue so painful as trying to move one way while your on-screen character seems determined to move another, and that's all thanks to a little piece of dirt (dust, fluff, toast or otherwise) sneaking into the controller and ruining your day.

Microsoft, quite wisely, has chosen to avoid the kerfuffle by not releasing any first-party games at all. This year. We joke, Xbox friends — we love you! Now back to Game Pass with you...

In Sonic Frontiers, Sega finds the intersection of the series’ linear past and its “open-zone” future, paying capable service to both eras of the franchise. The open Starfall Islands offer engaging exploration, while linear Cyber Space stages deliver the familiar speed-based Sonic experience. Though each side of the coin has faults, Frontiers is an overall positive experience that serves as a boost in the right direction for the franchise.
Running through the open zones is often a joyful experience. …]]></summary>

Fire Emblem Engage is set to come to Switch on 23rd January, 2023, bringing the series to the new world of Elyos. As we have come to expect from the franchise, Engage will introduce us to a new team of heroes but, as confirmed by Nintendo, there are also set to be cameos from few recognisable faces of entries past.
Summoned via magical rings, these legacy heroes — 'Emblems' — will be able to be called upon in battle to bolster your strength or to use their abilities alongside your own.

The World War One FPS has been spotted nestled in Steam’s top ten best-selling games rankings (thanks, Emopulse), although it's since slipped out again. Battlefield 1’s also set a record over the weekend for its all-time highest concurrent player numbers, reaching more than 50,000 players in the past 24 hours. I say, tip top.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sowing seeds.
These days, it feels like games are very generally cast into either the ‘Indie’ or ‘AAA’ categories, regardless of genre. Square Enix has been a major publisher that’s notably been pushing back against this dichotomy by putting out several games that are smaller in scope than something like Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, but have much higher production values than a budget indie game. Titles like The Diofield Chronicle or the Voice of Cards trilogy have filled this niche well, and now Square is doing it again with Harvestella. Billed by many as the company’s attempt at the Rune Factory formula, this farm sim and action-RPG hybrid does a solid job of merging two very different genres into a cohesive experience. It’s far from perfect, but this feels like a very solid foundation that will hopefully be built upon in the future.
Harvestella takes place in a world ruled over by four giant crystals called “Seaslights” that govern the passing of the four seasons. Some undisclosed amount of time before the narrative begins, the Seaslights begin to act strangely and introduce a new, one-day season that the residents come to call “Quietus” or the season of death. During Quietus, an evil 'death dust' fills the air and anything living that ventures outside will die upon contact with the dust. Well, except your conveniently amnesiac character, who wakes up on the ground outside in a village during Quietus. After somehow surviving, the locals let you stay in a ‘shed’ on the edge of town while you recover your memory, and you soon start to try your hand at farming. Eventually, you then get caught up in a grand quest to investigate the Seaslights’ disturbance and hopefully learn more about where you came from.

The newly released metroidvania Ghost Song is, by all accounts, a pretty solid game, but our own experiences with the Switch version left a bit of a sour taste in our mouths when it came to the performance. In our review, we stated that it "suffers from significant performance problems on Switch, from an inconsistent frame rate to extensive loading times that destroy any flow the game has".
Well, thankfully then, it seems that developer Old Moon has already moved to address the frame rate issues, which should hopefully make for a more stable experience for players. The news comes via a Twitter update from creator Matt White, who states that the frame rate has now been locked for Switch:

We are so very close now to Pokémon Scarlet and Violet's release next week on 18th November, and predictably certain game-spoiling leaks have started appearing online.
This specific leak appears to have stemmed from someone managing to get their hands on a copy of the game prior to its official release date, though it is unclear as to whether this has been a product of a retailer missing the mark or if the game has been attained by other means.

As Blizzard Entertainment continues beavering away at its upcoming sequel Diablo IV, the rumor mills have started churning out potential dates for the eventual return of one of gaming's grimmest and most uniquely compelling dungeon crawlers. We have already been told the title will be "playable" in 2023, though when and in what form remains a mystery.
Enter frequent spoiler XboxEra podcast, as hosted by Windows Central. In the most recent episode of the show, it was suggested that Blizzard could be planning on launching the sequel as soon as April of next year, with pre-orders opening in December, perhaps following a brand new trailer at the upcoming Game Awards show, which is currently scheduled to take place exactly one month from now. Pre-orders are expected to include standard editions alongside Blizzard's typical premium collector's set.

Of course, this is mostly hearsay (or should that be "heresy"?) for now, but the XboxEra podcast has been pretty much on the money when it comes to the revelation of upcoming projects and release dates. We already know that Diablo IV is in a very playable form, as private betas have been circling among staff and colleagues for some time now (complete with oodles of leaked footage). Sping 2023 still seems a little early, but if Overwatch 2 has taught us anything, Blizzard is not the "ready when it's ready" company it once was, and is seemingly far more interested in getting products out in customers' hands ASAP.
Diablo IV is currently in development for PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is fast approaching its release date of May 12th, 2023 (yes, it'll be here a lot sooner than you think!), so it's likely that Nintendo is currently in the final stages of development for the game and ironing out any egregious bugs that might still be lying about.

If you've been waiting to hear more about PvE, welp, that wasn't the focus of today's stream — and the new story missions won't be playable until 2023 — but we've got a roadmap for PvP and confirmation that loot boxes are out and a battle pass format is in.
Coming off of Overwatch 1, the team's main goal is to try and deliver content on a "frequent and consistent basis," according to game director Aaron Keller.

You know that feeling you get when you're driving down a highway at sunset, and the perfect song comes on the radio? All of a sudden, it feels like you're in a music video, or that bit at the start of a '90s teen movie, where everything is sparkling and perfect. The music becomes a soundtrack, and your life becomes a story.
There are a few brilliant moments like this in media, too — ones that deploy the right song at the right moment for a perfect synergy of feelings. Think of how Edgar Wright uses licensed music in his films to underline tense, snappy moments and add comedy, or the use of Don't You (Forget About Me) at the end of The Breakfast Club, or the Imogen Heap-scored season 2 finale of The O.C., which became so iconic that it got its own SNL skit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Songs of praise.
Over the past decade, the Metroidvania has seen a tremendous resurgence in popularity. And yet, it’s easy to forget how far we’ve come. If we rewind the clock back to the year 2013, the Metroid and Castlevania franchises were on ice and the indie Metroidvania scene was only just beginning to take off. That’s when Matt White launched a Kickstarter for a Super Metroid-inspired game, titled Ghost Song, which smashed through its original funding goals and went into full production. Now, nearly a decade later, Ghost Song has finally been released on Nintendo Switch, and it is a wonderful homage to some of the genre’s greatest entries, although Switch perhaps isn't the best place to play.
In the first few minutes of the game, you’ll immediately notice that Ghost Song has two primary inspirations. Level design, enemy designs, and atmosphere influences are clearly based on Metroid. Single-block vertical platforming reminiscent of Super Metroid and the primary enemy design looking eerily similar to a Chozo will make any Samus fan feel at home. As for gameplay, however, Ghost Song instead draws heavily from Dark Souls. You lose your currency when falling in battle, having to trek back to where you last died in order to reclaim them. Using those, you can choose to level up certain stats, like health or damage, at statues around the map. There estus flask equivalents, which can be used at any time and refilled at save points.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's running through November 9
A new My Nintendo Rabbids promotion is afoot, and it's currently live now through November 9, 2022 at 2AM ET.
As a bid to promote Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope (which is out later this month), it'll involve several figurines/plush toys, as well as more traditional collector's edition swag like lithographs and an art book. It'll work just like prior My Nintendo contests, where folks can spend 10 Platinum Points for an entry, up to three entries.
As a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked.
Here is what the My Nintendo Rabbids prize lot entails:
Rabbid Mario Figurine
Rabbid Peach Figurine
Set of 3 lithographs
Spark Plush
Artbook
Spark Phone Ring Holder
Stickers Sheet
[Update: Here's a reminder that the contest ends on November 9 at 2AM ET. Effectively, unless you're a night owl, you have until tomorrow evening in most regions to put your Platinum Points up.]

Frankly, I don't know how I got this far — a life packed to capacity with long walks, bad houses, far too many tablets, and even more donuts. But I'm still here, because, no matter how bad things might have gotten from time to time, there is always much to do, much to achieve, much to enjoy, and many fine people still to meet.
Today is going to be a bit of a quiet one for me, unfortunately. But it's ok. Everyone on Destructoid has been very busy lately with the ongoing site transition, and I'm grateful for the quiet weekend. I will probably …]]></summary>

Persona 5 Royal got released on the Nintendo Switch last month and the tech experts have now put every console version of the game to the test. So how does the Switch version hold up? Firstly, it is a full-featured version of the game, without any fundamental cutbacks. Even the loading times remain quick.
There are areas where the game has taken a hit though. Texture resolution and the texture assets are "significantly degraded" - especially in comparison to the PlayStation 4 version. Shadows also aren't quite as noticeable. In isolation, texture resolution is still "mostly fine" but there are some downgrades.

In case you missed it before, Iron Man VR is essentially an Iron Man simulator, complete with dual-hand repulsor control, and a unique storyline. You'll spend a lot of time thrusting around vistas and open canyons blowing up robots, chasing up leads and even walking around a bit as Tony Stark.
All of the same core gameplay is back, and it still works. The idea of simply using two separate VR controllers as Iron Man hands is genius, as you can fly or shoot with either han…]]></summary>

Little Inferno is a name you might not have heard in quite a while. The indie project about burning things for fun and profit is back in 2022, with the Little Inferno Ho Ho Ho Holiday Expansion.
Arriving on November 18, Little Inferno is ringing in the festive season with plenty of kindling. Nutcrackers, reindeer, jelly beans, and more are all ripe for the flame.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3DWkqFyqhw
It's a pretty sizeable expansion, with an entirely new story and a new character. Plenty of holiday products await your flame, and there are over 50 new combos to discover. Or you can just get the infinitely burning Yule Log and have yourself a relaxing, cozy night by the TV light.
All I want for Christmas is fuel
Little Inferno first lit a spark back in 2012, becoming a bit of a sensation in an ever-growing indie scene. Developer Tomorrow Corporation has gone on to make some fun puzzle games, like Human Resource Machine and 7 Billion Humans.
But something about the discoverability and mystery of Little Inferno still feels all its own. While it's made it to new consoles in the time since its debut, seeing a new DLC drop for it this many years later is pretty exciting.
So if you want to ring in the new year with a little fuel and a little fire, Little Inferno is back with more reasons to celebrate the season. It's up for wishlisting on Steam, Epic, and GOG, and is headed to Nintendo Switch, iOS, and Android sometime soon.

While it may have seemed like a done deal from the get-go, we set out to find which of these games is the best and who better to ask than you, our lovely readers? We roped in you fine folks to rate every Simpsons game that you have played out of ten, and below you'll find the results.

The retro gaming aficionados over at Hamster are continuing on their current trend of pulling out bafflingly bizarre and outrageously obscure arcade titles for your approval — And this week's entry is no different, with the arrival of Nichibutsu's unique, star-gazing... shmup? Mischievous Angel.
Released to arcades in 1984, (as Itazura Tenshi), this surprisingly novel little release sees the player don the wings of a starbound angel, who is tasked with recreating the constellations in order to impress his pretty angel pal. Using non-linear, eight-way directional gameplay, our heroes travel through a gridded starscape, lining up stars in a "dot-to-dot" fashion in order to complete various famous star signs and constellations, such as The Big Dipper... umm... Jerry The Cowboy... and... Alan... The Cowboy.
Check out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber Old Classic Retro Gaming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M9ut_Ovm3w
As the not-so-mischievous angel lights up the sky, they must also avoid attack from sensible villains such as alien invaders, witches, and flying jesters. Fear not, as grabbing a bow and arrow will offer up temporary firepower to fend off these ne'er-do-wells. Because he's also Cupid?.. or Kid Icarus?.. or something. Following several cosmos of action, our young lovers must be reunited in a recurring bonus stage so wholesome and melancholy that is has to be seen to be believed.
Mischievous Angel is, despite its admittedly dated mechanics, a pretty unique and cute take on the shmup genre, with a delightful concept and some sweet visual design ideas. While hardly a smash hit of the arcade circuit, it is undeniably an original idea, and it is nice to see this quirky release curated in the Arcade Archives range.
Mischievous Angel is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.

These systems are reportedly very good but that's making Russia nervous. Western anti-piracy companies dominate the market and at least in theory, could black out TV sets all over the country. A second scenario has Russia equally worried - free premium TV for all.

Monster Rancher, for me, has always been a game I enjoyed more for its gimmick rather than its gameplay. Back in the ‘90s, I wasn’t too hot about slowly raising a monster through battles, training, and adventures just to eventually fuse them with another monster and start the process all over again. I was far more interested in the gimmick. I went through every CD in my parent’s collection, unlocking whatever monsters were tied to their Garth Brooks and Shania Twain albums. My friends at school would exchange CDs and report back what we unlocked.
For me, that was the game. I didn’t care too much about being an actual rancher. I just wanted to see what monsters I would get if I put in my Space Jam CD. Would I even care about this series if it didn’t have that…]]></summary>

Signs pointed to a big reveal of Mauga as the next hero to join the Overwatch 2 cast at tonight's Overwatch League Grand Finals. But, signs are often wrong, and during the event, a different character was revealed to be joining the fight next. An omnic and the leader of Null Sector, Ramattra will be the next tank to join the roster in Overwatch 2 season 2. Ramattra is on a mission to make the world a better place for the omnics by any means necessary. This will be the second tank added to the Overwatch cast since the game was relaunched as Overwatch 2.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd_SPOkaZZ4
Ramattra will join the hero shooter on December 6. As somebody who played the original Overwatch for many months after Blizzard stopped adding new characters, it's great to finally see a steady flow of new faces for the game. Now if only I could get teamed up with people who know what the hell they're doing.
I'm looking forward to seeing what Overwatch 2 season 2 has in store. I just hope I actually have the time to play it. Sadly, Marvel Snap is currently eating up all my free time alongside the four different farming games I'm playing at the moment. In what time I have been able to spend with the game, I've mostly stuck with the healers I've been using for years while trying to relearn all the different damage characters that I haven't messed with since 2020. However, I have been looking for a new tank since the game completely reworked Orisa. Maybe Ramattra will become my next go-to hero on that front. And if not, I can always fall back on boring ol' Reinhardt.

Lionsgate is toying with the idea of another John Wick video game. The entertainment company's CEO said in a recent earnings call that the studio is fielding proposals.
As reported by IndieWire, Lionsgate CEO Jon Feltheimer said the company has been "fielding proposals" around a John Wick game.
"I don’t want to get ahead of myself here, but we believe there is a big AAA game to be made out of John Wick," said Feltheimer. "We have been fielding proposals. We certainly are interested in moving that forward, but I don’t want to say anything more about that at this time."
It's not a major commitment. But it is interest in a franchise that's already seen some adaptation, and could see more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7XM597XO94
I'm thinkin' I'm back
John Wick has already had his own game, in the form of Bithell Games' John Wick Hex. The studio imagined Wick's action-heavy shootouts in turn-based strategy puzzles, in a way that reminded me a bit of Invisible, Inc.
It sounds like John Wick Hex turned out alright, too. But the CEO's choice of words, in "big" and "AAA," bring to mind a hefty investment.
Considering the only other John Wick adaptation we have in the virtual space aside from Hex is a Fortnite cameo, there's still room. A studio like Sloclap could absolutely tackle something fast-paced and action-heavy in the Wick universe. Though my personal choice would be to give this the Alpha Protocol treatment. Either way, I'm all for more digital Keanu.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Who do you think the new hero will be?
Overwatch is back in full swing with the release of the sequel, and that means we're back in the swing of the hype surrounding new hero releases. I mean, I still mostly stick to the roster of original heroes because I like the simplicity of their kits, but even if I don't plan on playing any of the new additions, their presence still switches up the meta significantly. Now rumors are flying as to who the newest recruit to the Overwatch lineup is going to be, and the frontrunner as of now is Mauga, a Talon Heavy Assault and former friend of Baptiste.
Mauga appeared in a short story called "What You Left Behind," which focused on Baptiste's backstory and was released alongside the Baptiste Reunion Challenge mini-event. Mauga and Baptiste were both part …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The original Dungeons & Dragons RPG grew out of a connection to miniature wargames, so it’s little surprise that the DNA of tactical tabletop play has remained bound to the long-running franchise ever since. The current edition of D&D supports tremendous flexibility in playing out combat how you like, including through tabletop miniature play, allowing big battles to flow out from ongoing campaign storylines in your weekly sessions. However, perhaps your group is more into combat than interconnected storylines. Or, more likely, you sometimes just want a break from the campaign planning to have a focused evening of combat. If that’s the case, WizKids’ new Dungeons & Dragons: Onslaught game should be on your radar.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Don't worry about the differences too much, though
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge is getting a new version this month. The latest TMNT title is getting a native PS5 version on November 15.
What's different? Aside from running natively on the PlayStation 5, not much. Tribute Games and DotEmu have made it clear this version is identical to the PlayStation 4 version of TMNT: Shredder's Revenge. Previously, TMNT would run on backward compatibility for the PS5, using the PS4 version.
This does mean that PS4 users aren't getting a free upgrade to the new version. But again, this is apparently not a substantively different option. So the reason why DotEmu and Tribute are making this? Well, it looks like for a possible physical version.
"The PS5 version is necessary to eventually offer physical PS5 copies ;)," the Tribute Games account noted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozKsDzumb0c
So if you've got one PlayStation copy, you still seem set. And down the line, this might allow for a PS5 physical version of the turtle-based beat 'em up.
A new platform for TMNT
Shredder's Revenge was released earlier this year, and brought a whole lot of Saturday morning cartoon action to PC and consoles. The TMNT beat 'em up did pretty alright in sales too, so it's not too surprising to see these studios considering future options with the native PS5 edition.
Whether we see more content arrive in TMNT: Shredder's Revenge in the future or not seems up in the air. I'd love to see the crew dip deeper into TMNT nostalgia, but considering DotEmu especially has a good track record for beat 'em ups, I'm eager to see whatever's in store next.

Other favourite examples of mine include last year's Boyfriend Dungeon (a dating sim and dungeon crawler), Max Gentlemen: Sexy Business (a dating and business sim), and HuniePop (a dating sim and match-3 puzzle game). Monster Prom is a dating sim and competitive multiplayer party game, where up to four players vie to romance attractive monsters and invite them to the school dance.

Between graphics, overall game design, and storytelling techniques, games have come a long way over the past few years, but the most impressive improvements have come from the new accessibility settings that developers are including in their games -- like God of War, for example. Never before have we seen such close attention to detail in making the interactive medium more readily available to anyone who wants to play, and Santa Monica Studio is helping to blaze the trail with the release of God of War Ragnarok. 
The developers posted an exhaustive blog on the PlayStation website that goes through every possible accessibility setting in God of War Ragnarok, and it's pretty cool to see in my opinion. There are sections in the menu for Vision, Hearing, and Motor Access…]]></summary>

Bruce Wayne has had many ups and downs in his personal life, in just about every single iteration of Batman media that he appears in: it's kind of his thing. And the same goes for the sea of Batman video games; which, quite frankly, is filled with sunken barges of ill-advised movie tie-ins and projects that just didn't have as much love and care as they should have.
Here's a list of our top five Batman games throughout the ages.

5 - Batman: The Video Game (NES)
A dark horse pick that Bruce Wayne himself would have been proud of: the surprisingly influential movie tie-in game on the NES takes number five.

Following on from its eye-widening PlayStation VR 2 (PSVR2) price reveal, Sony Interactive Entertainment has released a list of games that will be arriving in 2023 on the virtual reality hardware. The list of 11 titles leans heavily on the spooky-ooky, spearheaded by The Dark Pictures: Switchback.
A spin-off entry in Supermassive Games' enjoyable horror anthology, The Dark Pictures: Switchback is a literal rollercoaster ride through an array of creepy environments, jump-scares, and other frightening imagery. It seems very similar in concept to Supermassive's own Until Dawn: Rush of Blood, which was also a VR rollercoaster ride released for the original PSVR hardware in 2016.
https://youtu.be/HniskV3aJ7o
The Dark Pictures: Switchback is one of only two titles on the new list that appears to be a PSVR2 exclusive, joining Smilegate shooter Crossfire: Sierra Squad. The previously revealed launch title Horizon: Call of the Mountain — also available in a bundle with the new hardware — is also expected to be PSVR2 only. The full list of 11 titles is as follows, with release dates still to be announced.
Crossfire: Sierra Squad - (Smilegate)
The Dark Pictures: Switchback - (Supermassive Games)
The Light Brigade - (Funktronic Labs)
Cities VR: Enhanced Edition – (Fast Travel Games)
Cosmonious High - (Owlchemy Labs)
Hello Neighbor: Search & Rescue - (tinyBuild Games)
Jurassic World Aftermath Collection - (Coatsink)
Pistol Whip - (Cloudhead Games)
Zenith: The Last City - (Ramen VR)
After the Fall - (Vertigo Games)
Tentacular - (Firepunchd Games)
PlayStation VR2 launches worldwide February 22, 2023, priced at $550 USD. For more details on all of the PSVR2 games featured in the new list, check out the official PlayStation Blog.

[Update: The Breakers Collection beta is now live and can be downloaded from Steam.]
QuByte Interactive has announced that it will be holding an open beta this weekend to test the online stability of its long-time-coming rerelease Breakers Collection. The test period will kick off on PC (via Steam on Friday, November 4, and will rock on for an as-yet-undisclosed amount of time, ahead of the title's January release.
Breakers Collection, as we have reported many times, is a compendium of two cult '90s fighters, Breakers and Breakers' Revenge, which was available in arcades and on the Neo Geo platform in the mid-1990s. The new rerelease features both games in their entirety, sporting modern-day technological boosts such as rollback netcode and crossplay support, as well as a range of cool new features including Team Battle Mode, Interactive Replays, online profiles, and a deep Training Mode.
https://twitter.com/qubytegames/status/1585738737576685569?s=20&t=SvEeQrq8DSxf7_4gyedVOA
If you want in on the beta beatings, then all you need do is wishlist Breakers Collection on Steam and download the beta client prior to the big server switch-on this Friday. While the Breakers titles struggled to find their feet alongside the Street Fighter Alpha series, as well as the then-influx of 3D fighters such as Tekken and Soulcalibur, there is no denying that the series has its own charm, and is still a fun and engaging 2D fighter even today, decades on from its initial release. This new release will provide the dedicated Breakers community with a much-needed official platform for the fighter's competitive scene.
Breakers Collection launches January 12, 2023, on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch. Physical editions are available to pre-order now exclusively at Strictly Limited Games.

Insomniac Games and Sony are celebrating the 20th anniversary of the Ratchet & Clank franchise. Some throwback armor is headed to Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart, and some classic Ratchet is going on PlayStation Plus Premium.
The Ratchet & Clank series kicked off in 2002, with the very first game for PlayStation 2. Since then, there have been quite a few entries in the duo's adventures.
For the most recent, Rift Apart, Insomniac is releasing several sets of armor, free for all players. They arrive in a pack today. Here's the full list:
Commando Armor (Inspired by Ratchet & Clank: Going Commando)
Holoflux Armor (Inspired by Ratchet & Clank Future: A Crack in Time)
Quest Armor (Inspired by Ratchet & Clank Future: Quest for Booty)
Marauder Armor (Inspired by Ratchet: Deadlocked)
Clank Armor

Ratcheting up the nostalgia
There are some classic Ratchet & Clank games arriving soon for PlayStation Plus Premium subscribers, too.
Several games, like Into the Nexus and Quest for Booty, are already on Premium's game catalog. But on November 15, several more classic Ratchet & Clank titles will hit the service. These are some classic titles, going back to the PS2 era of
Ratchet & Clank (PS3)
Ratchet & Clank: Going Commando (PS3)
Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal (PS3)
Ratchet & Clank: Deadlocked (PS3)
Ratchet & Clank Future: Tools of Destruction (PS3)
Today's PlayStation blog announcing the news also dug deep into the history vaults. There are a ton of quotes and tidbits from throughout the years, discussing the history of one of Sony's most prominent faces. It's a cool way to explore the history and legacy of Ratchet & Clank, two decades on.
The new armor is available now in Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart. The older Ratchet titles hit PlayStation Plus Premium, one of Sony's upper subscription tiers, on November 15.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Standing here, I realize that this Super Replay will be a cut above the rest because we’ll be slicing and dicing in Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance! Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. You can also catch up on previous episodes by visiting our new Game Informer Shows YouTube channel or watching the latest episode embedded below. 
Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. 


Join me, Marcus Stewart, and Blake Hester as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure. If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes. You’ll also be granted entry to the official Game Informer Discord channel, where our welcoming community members, moderators, and staff gather to talk games, entertainment, food, and organize hangouts!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You'll never be Maidenless
The prestige Japanese clothing company Edwin revealed a new line of apparel based upon Bandai Namco's smash-hit RPG Elden Ring — As spotted by Siliconera, the Elden Ring x Edwin line will be made available to pre-order from the denim enthusiast's official website this month, and is perfect for battling those winter winds (and giant hands).

First and foremost is this unique hooded cloak, stylized after that worn by Elden Ring's top Kindling Maiden, Melina. The design features a wide hood and an expanding bell shape, so you'll strike quite the figure walking down the high street as a big goth triangle. The cloak buttons up at the front and features the insignia of The Golden Order emblazoned on the back. It's a very outlandish piece, but I really dig it.
The hooded cloak/jacket retails for ¥21,780 (roughly $150 USD) and can be ordered right here.

The second item in the Elden Ring x Edwin collection is a long sleeve denim shirt, which sports a more traditional-looking design for those of you who might not wish to be approached for side-quests. The shirt is manufactured in the same trademark Edwin denim, and also features the insignia of The Golden Order. I'm not sure about denim shirts personally, (they sort of make my skin crawl), but for non-wierdos, this is a pretty stylish bit of apparel.
The denim shirt retails for ¥10,780 (roughly $75 USD) and can be ordered right here. Obviously, both prices do not include shipping or any potential customs charges, but Edwin does serve multiple international outlets, so fans outside of Japan can bag themselves this exclusive merchandise. Pre-orders will open from November 15-25, with products expected to ship in March 2023.
Elden Ring is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

RimWorld is the more direct influence, really. Instead of a planet's surface, your little blobby torso people are stuck on a spaceship, which you need to rebuild around them using a fleet of robots as they gradually wake up from stasis. If you know the genre well, it will be reminiscent of several games, but its balance of survival, management, and creative building makes for a refreshingly forgiving experience at the current default settings.

Kaye’s nonchalant accent seems like a great fit, as you’ll see in the trailer below.

Legendary British sci-fi show Doctor Who is the latest franchise to get its bean on in the madcap world of Mediatonic's Fall Guys — The topsy-turvy battle royale title currently has a new range of cosmetic items up for grabs, all pulled from the time lord's great canon of chrono-crossing adventures.
Three of the fourteen Doctors are represented in this new event, immediately recognizable thanks to the quirky hero's penchant for fabulous fashions. We have the wild scarf and Autumnal style of the iconic Fourth Doctor, as portrayed by Tom Baker in the 1970s. Also available is the most recent incarnation of the character, the Thirteenth Doctor, played in groundbreaking fashion by Jodie Whittaker since 2018.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xdRbMhduVE
The Fourteenth Doctor, who one might confuse for the Tenth Doctor, is available to purchase as a brand new skin for your been, celebrating the momentary return of fan-favorite actor David Tennant. And, of course, what would Doctor Who be without his arch-enemy, The Daleks? And thus, a Dalek costume is also available from the marketplace — Although, given that they can't even get upstairs, Fall Guys hardly seems to be the perfect place for the ruthless, droning robots.
All four skins are available to purchase now in the Fall Guys store. In addition, a brand new emote will play the famous TARDIS sound effect upon activation. Sorry, it won't automatically regenerate you beside the crown. You still gotta do all of the hard work yourself. Better bring your sonic screwdriver.
Fall Guys is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

A Pokemon Splatfest is imminent, but until then, Japan is going all-out with their celebrations for the milestone event: which includes swag, and Pokemon center participation (as well as a few other locations listed below).
First up, Nintendo is offering keychains for Platinum Points (for My Nintendo Japan), including SKUs for each of the Splatfest choices: grass, fire, and water. They actually resemble the patterns of the t-shirts that will appear in-game, which is a nice touch.
A "Collaboration Festival" is also underway at Pokemon Centers "nationwide" (again, in Japan), where you can pick up tie-in stickers (featuring the key art for the event). Curiously, some centers also have "polling stations," which include "voting stickers" for each choice.
As a reminder, everything will kick off on November 11 at 4PM PT, through November 13 at that same time. The Pokemon Center tie-ins begin on October 21, and will run through November 13 (or, as Nintendo points out, as long as supplies last).
Here's a list of the Japanese locations hosting Pokemon Splatfest events:
Bic Camera Sapporo (Hokkaido)
Bic Camera Yurakucho (Tokyo)
Yodobashi Camera Multimedia Akiba (Tokyo)
Bic Camera Lazona Kawasaki (Kanagawa)
Yodobashi Camera Multimedia Yokohama (Kanagawa)
Yodobashi Camera Multimedia Umeda (Osaka)
Yodobashi Camera Multimedia Hakata (Fukuoka)
"All Pokemon Center stores"
[Update: The US My Nintendo site has been updated, and confirms that the trio of keychains are "coming soon" to the US side.]
[Update #2: The Splatoon 3 keychain set is live on My Nintendo as of last night. It is indeed a set of all three, and sold out quickly. Hopefully they'll restock it, but note that the listing is live, if you want to bookmark it/check in on it.]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been an interesting exercise playing Triangle Strategy and Tactics Ogre: Reborn in quick succession lately. I've now played both Square Enix strategy RPGs for around six hours apiece now - starting with Tactics Ogre for my preview the other week, and following it up with a Triangle-shaped chaser. I didn't have any history with either game before now, but it's become increasingly apparent that they're effectively cut from the same tile-based cloth. And I mean, exactly the same. They're so similar, in fact, that it's kinda hilarious Square are releasing them so close together on PC, with Tactics Ogre's release on November 11th following little more than a month after Triangle Strategy. 
At the same time, though, their approach to story-telling couldn't be more different, and comparing and contrasting them like this one after the other has been both fun and enlightening. Triangle Strategy, for example, is about 80% cutscene, 20% fighting for its first six hours, while Tactics Ogre is pretty much the opposite. And yet… I think I sort of prefer Triangle Strategy? Let me explain.

Originally released in arcades in 1995, before making the leap to Sega Saturn 1997, Elevator Action Returns is a sequel to Taito's modest 1983 hit, fully designed as an explosive, bullet-pumping, action epic. One or two players choose from a trio of special agents, before engaging in frenetic and highly cinematic side-scrolling run 'n' gun action.
While maintaining some of the core elements of the 1983 release, Elevator Acti…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Team Ninja's Soulslike action-RPG Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty was announced not long ago, I thought: "Wow, that looks like my sort of jam". A PS5 demo came out and I only got to spend all of five minutes with it before life got in the way. I never got to truly taste the jam, which was quite sad. So, colour me very excited when I got to spend a good couple of hours battling through two short hands-on demos. I got battered by a big pig, prickled to death by a massive porcupine, and aggressively mauled by a large tiger. And I'd say I had a whale of a time. There was no killer whale in the demo, but I wouldn't count it out for the full release.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[God of War Ragnarok is out next week and ahead of the game's release, developer Santa Monica Studio has revealed more than 70 accessibility features in the game. 
PlayStation has been pushing the importance of accessibility in gaming more and more with each new release and Ragnarok is no different. The studio has been quite open with its accessibility desires, detailing more than 60 in a blog post earlier this year. Now, with the game out on November 9, the studio has released an even more detailed post breaking down exactly what to expect. 


Santa Monica Studio says there are more than 70 features in Ragnarok that "enable players to customize the gameplay experience to suit their needs" and the list is a sight to behold. It includes plenty of presets, too, which could make it easier for players to easily get the game started in a way that makes the experience better for them. Presets include one for vision accessibility, hearing accessibility, motion reduction, apply motor accessibility, and a changed setting indicator as well. 
There are alternative control schemes, remappable buttons, hold and press options, in-game assistance settings, and so much more. If you're interested in what accessibility features are in Ragnarok, be sure to check out the full blog post. 
For more, read Game Informer's God of War Ragnarok review and then check out all of the performance and quality modes for the game.

        <id>119447</id>

        <updated>2022-11-04T12:28:21.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The composer for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, Sarah Schachner, has revealed that she has parted ways with the game and the free-to-play battle royale Call of Duty: Warzone (and likely the upcoming Warzone 2). As for why, she says the working dynamic with the game's audio director has become difficult and she sees no path forward. Variety reports that the audio director in question is Stephen Miller but Schachner doesn't name this person in her announcement. 
News of her departure comes from a statement released by Schachner on Twitter on November 3, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. Schachner's departure comes after years of work with Modern Warfare II studio Infinity Ward on games like 2019's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and 2016's Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare. Other credits include Assassin's Creed Valhalla and Anthem, as noted by VGC. 
"I am sad to say I can no longer continue to compose music for MWII/Warzone," her statement reads. "Over the past couple of months, the working dynamic with the audio director has become increasingly challenging and I don't see any path forward. As of now, I am unsure of the status and release plan for the soundtrack as it's been taken out of my hands. While I don't have any control over how the music is presented in-game, what will be released on the soundtrack is not my artistic intent in regards to mixing and mastering." 
She then thanks fans for their support and gives some shout outs to others involved with the game's score, including mixer Frank Wolf, "creative vision" Mike Dean, and performing artists including Baseck, Brain Mantia, and M.B. Gordy.
You can read her full statement below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We finally have AMD’s answer to the Nvida RTX 40 series: the Radeon RX 7900 XT and Radeon RX 7900 XTX, the red team’s first graphics cards build on the RDNA 3 architecture. These are both high-end GPUs, set to cost $899 and $999 respectively when they release on December 13th, but you’ll note those prices are oodles cheaper than the £1269 / $1199 RTX 4080 and the £1679 / $1599 RTX 4090.
They’re also structurally distinct from the current Radeon RX 6000 cards to an extent that, frankly, is quite surprising to see from AMD GPUs. RDNA 3 uses a Ryzen CPU-inspired chiplet design, where the GPU is split up into different sections, and the new media engine is engineered for the 4K gaming monitors of the future as much as it is for current PC hardware.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What selection? Who knows!
Time to get your retro fingers a-clickin' as SNK has announced that it will release its pint-sized compendium Neo Geo Pocket Color Selection Vol 2 on PC and Nintendo Switch as soon as November 9.
Much like its predecessor, the Neo Geo Pocket Color Selection Vol. 2 will feature a fistful of games pulled from the archives of the publisher's misunderstood handheld console, which launched way back in 1999 but unfortunately struggled to find a mainstream audience, despite its solid technical design and library of fun and unique titles.
https://twitter.com/SNKPofficial/status/1588350318395342848?s=20&t=A5PutVidqCwmn3rbvDPpZA
Somewhat frustratingly, given the impending launch, SNK did not actually reveal the list of games that would be featured on the new volume. Hardcore SNK heads might be able to divulge the 10 lucky titles from the splash art, however, which appears to spotlight characters from titles such as Biomotor Unitron, Baseball Stars, Neo Geo Cup '98, Rockman Battle, Big Band Pro Wrestling, and the super cool SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters Clash, among others. To be clear, this is educated speculation on my part.
As I've noted before, the NGPC console was genuinely unique and well-made handheld, which deserved a better fate than the one it received. Thus, it's wonderful to see this bespoke library of games archived for both current and future generations. When we have an official game list for Vol. 2, we will be sure to let you know. In the meantime, Neo Geo Pocket Color Selection Vol. 1 is available now on PC and Switch.
Neo Geo Pocket Color Selection Vol. 2 launches November 9 on PC and Nintendo Switch.

Pulsating lights stretch in a vertical column from the top to the bottom of my screen, scattering into deadly particles like notes played on an accordion of cosmic destruction. Fireworks burst in every corner, thanks to the evolved version of my diamond-spewing runetracer weapon that’s now called ‘NO FUTURE’. Monsters go pop by their thousands. Flaming meteors still abound.
Vampire Survivors is an arcade-style survivathon about weaving through fields of enemies as your weapons automatically obliterate the oncoming hordes. It’s still about collecting upgrades until you’re the locus of an unstoppable death machine, and now that it’s left early access that death machine comes in more colours and more flavours. There are new maps to conquer, new characters to conquer with, and new secrets to uncover. If you haven’t played since the early access launch then yes, it’s worth checking out the new stuff. If you haven’t played at all, then God yes, please check out all the stuff. Or like, most of it.
Vampire Survivors is still morish. Up to a point.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Kastov-74u ban has begun in Modern Warfare II
It always takes a few weeks to adjust after a new Call of Duty game comes out (or any online multiplayer game, really), including server issues, any outstanding bugs, and of course, balancing out any mechanics that might give players an advantage over others. Apparently, that's exactly the case with the Kastov-74u, which has been banned in pro tournaments lately. The gun is based on the real world AK-47 submachine gun, but in Modern Warfare II, it's actually classified as an assault rifle.
Basically, the Kastov-74u rips through enemies at close range like a submachine gun, but also does well at mid-range, which makes it more akin to an assault rifle. While it's not unheard of for players to get creative with their loadouts and use guns for plays that they weren't originally intended for (close range quick-scoping with a sniper rifle being the most famous example of this), but the Kastov is missing the balance that makes for a fair fight, according to the pro players.

The bans started rolling in only three days after the professional season started in the first place -- if there's one thing we can always rely on, it's pro gamers optimizing a game in the shortest amount of time possible. As a casual Call of Duty player, it never ceases me to see how players can suss out the most powerful builds on what seems like intuition to me, but then again I guess that's why they're professionals at this.
In wake of the bans, streamer and pro Call of Duty player Swagg shared his favorite Kastov-74u loadout, which features the BR209 Barrel, Merc Foregrip Underbarrel, and the True-Tac Grip Rear Grip. It's a simple build, featuring only three out of a possible five attachments, but apparently adding too many of the Modern Warfare II attachments can hinder you more than they help you in some cases.

A Plague Tale is always one of those game series I'm glad to see is doing well, because the games provide a nice new perspective in the industry.

The studio behind the games, Focus Entertainment, has announced via Twitter that A Plague Tale: Requiem has surpassed 1 million players, which is always an impressive milestone for an indie game. The game was officially released on October 18th, so it's also pretty telling that it was able to surpass that number only a few weeks after its release, as well. The ann…]]></summary>

Owners of the game’s season pass, whether purchased separately for $29.99 or bundled in the game’s $89.99 Gold Edition, have three big adventures aimed at keeping them glued to the game throughout 2023. 
It all kicks off early next year with the first expansion, Tower of Doooom (their spelling, not mine). This introduces a new combat mode where the team must fight their way up Madame Bwahstrella’s multi-story tower to rescue Spawny, the visor-rocking Rabbid from Kingdom Battle. What’s important to note is that Tower of Doooom will be exclusive to the season pass, meaning you’ll be unable to purchase it separately. 
The second untitled DLC arrives in mid-2023. So far, we only know it takes players to a new planet, features never-before-seen enemies, allies, and secrets, and stars a new antagonist. Finally, Rayman crashes the party in the final expansion to close out the year. Ubisoft’s limbless hero joins Rabbid Peach and Rabbid Mario on a separate adventure in a new location. Unlike Tower of Doooom, the second and third expansions can be purchased a la carte. 
I enjoyed Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope quite a bit, awarding it a 9 out of 10. In my review, which you can read here, I wrote that the game “builds upon Kingdom Battle’s foundation with smart tweaks and fun additions to emerge as a better game in every way.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hideo Kojima has finally addressed the conspiracy theories revolving around him and Blue Box Game Studios' Abandoned and in short, it's a nuisance for him, unsurprisingly. 
Abandoned was announced with a short teaser back in 2021 as a game being developed for PlayStation 5 and PC. Not long after the reveal, speculation that Abandoned was actually a Silent Hill game secretly in development began to ramp up, but studio head Hasan Kahraman took to Twitter to shut down those rumors.
From there, the speculation train arrived at the idea that famed Metal Gear Solid developer Kojima was attached to the game. Some believed that Kojima actually was Kahraman on the basis that both their first names start with "H" and both their last names start with "K." Plus, people thought Blue Box was meant to ti…]]></summary>

We've all been there at some point in our lives, painstakingly planning a grand day out only for it to absolutely tip it down on the day in question - and for the boy in Inasa Fujio's hour-long narrative game, it's a trip to the local theme park during his summer holidays that gets rained off. 
Unfortunately, his mum (sensibly) decides against taking him and his brother out in the oncoming storm, so now he's got to face a day stuck inside his grandma's house instead. FUN. Turns out, though, that there are still plenty of memories to be made in this small, cluttered space. All you need is a little imagination.

What if you could do that while being more ethically sound, in a non-lethal way? Hold onto your butts because vanilla Skyrim modder drumfire has come up with the solution.

Matthew being away this week means that Nate takes on the role of the anti-Matthew, and we speculate about which games we think Matthew would probably find relatable.

To call the 2018 God of War a sequel almost does it a disservice. Yes, it was a continuation of Kratos’ original multi-game journey, but it placed him and a new family in a foreign world to reflect on his past and try to secure his future. Kratos’ journey to connect to his son while battling a new legion of distrustful gods was a revelation in both video game storytelling and action, setting a high bar for the inevitable sequel. Ragnarök may lack the unique impact of the prior game, but everything that worked so well the…]]></summary>

Without spoiling the ending of Village, the story left off in a way that created some big, interesting questions about the future of Resident Evil. From its beginning, the series has never claimed a singular protagonist, but moving forward, it seemed Ethan’s daughter Rose was going to be an important character to the franchise and whatever narrative direction a potential Resident Evil IX might follow. The Shadows of Rose DLC offers the first chance to play as Rose while filling in a small story gap that arguably did not need filling. Even with a somewhat benign…]]></summary>

You can read what we thought about those first hours in our God of War Ragnarök spoiler-free impressions here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ghost Song is a 2D Metroid-like that's always a feast for the eyes, but a frequent frustration for your head and hands. Its gorgeous art direction depicts a vibrant alien world that bubbles and throbs with bio-mechanical life, where spore clouds and fleshy organic tunnels live side by side with floating metal skulls and impenetrable thickets of wires and cables. It's a fascinating place that seems to morph and change with every passing map segment, calling to mind the animated techno gunge of Akira and Metropolis one minute, and the flowering brilliance of Alex Garland's Annihilation the next. Its roots sink deep, creating a world you'll want to explore every last nook and cranny of as you delve deeper into its underbelly to find out why you're here.
But Deadsuit, your android-like protagonist, makes for a slightly rusty-feeling companion at times, lacking the grace and elegance of Nintendo's Samus Aran, and the nimble dexterity of Team Cherry's nameless knight. It will tide you over until Silksong arrives, for sure, but it also never quite sings in the way you'd hope.

Normally you'd expect to pay around £60 for a 16GB dual-channel kit of DDR4 RAM hitting this spec, but today you can get a Kingston Fury Beast 16GB kit for just £48.64 at CCL in the UK.

Many of my thoughts on Elden Ring have been positive, as I'm still awestruck by the quality and scope of its open world (among many other things). But I admitted I'd reached my exhaustion point, which abated briefly, then came back with full force by the end.
Honestly, as much as I admire the game and its brilliance, I reckon it might be a bit too much for me. And as FromSoftware set the Soulslike standard, I find myself hoping that future Soulslikes don't get too caught up in trying to mimick Elden Ring.

This next-gen version of Nvidia’s DLSS upscaler not only boosts performance with render resolution trickery but also adds entirely new, AI-generated frames of its own, smoothing out visuals even further. Fewer than 40 games are confirmed to implement it so far but that number is growing, with Nvidia today announcing that Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales will include DLSS 3 when it launches for PC on November 18th.

The new trailer for shooty alternate universe action RPG Atomic Heart is a bit of a trip, frankly. Barrelling along at the speed of Sonic The Hedgehog, you can just about make out some weird looking Soviet robots, head-splitting mutants, and what seemed to be a truck plummeting towards towering futuristic architecture. Watch the eye-meltingly speedy trailer below, you’ll probably need some bugeye goggles afterwards to recuperate your peepers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Atomic Heart, the BioShock-esque shooter set in an alternate reality's Soviet Union, will be released this February. 
More specifically, the game will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on February 21, 2023. Developer Mundfish and publisher Focus Entertainment announced this news in a new and bloody gameplay trailer showcasing more of what to expect in the game early next year. 
Check out the Atomic Heart release date trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Atomic Heart continues to look great in trailers and I can't wait to finally go hands-on with it in just four months, especially as a fan of BioShock. While Atomic Heart is doing its own thing, it's hard not to compare it to the BioShock series given the whole alternate reality thing, the types of guns on display here, the enemies we'll be facing, and the hand-controlled powers. 
Atomic Heart was revealed years ago, and there are plenty more trailers to watch if you're interested. Check out this 2020 gameplay trailer for an early look at the game, and then watch this 2021 trailer for a look at the creepier side of Atomic Heart. Find out why it's one of our most anticipated horror games after that, and then watch this action-packed combat trailer from earlier this summer. 
For additional information about Atomic Heart, be sure to check out Mundfish's official website, where there's info about the game's different editions available for preorder and more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As Replika Elster, Signalis will force you to untangle a mess of writhing flesh and malfunctioning memories to separate dream from lived experience. So, in keeping with dream logic: You’ve played Signalis before, and you’ve never played anything like it. It lovingly adopts the trappings of PS1-era survival horror, and more importantly, it fully understands why those systems, aesthetics, tropes, and technical limits are so engaging. But it also presents and explores love and loss, freedom and manipulation, fear and trauma, in its own cruelly captivating way. It’s strange and familiar, gorgeous and horrible. It’s an absolute banger of a videogame, made all the more impressive by its indiest of indies price tag and two-person dev team.
Fundamentally, it's a love story. Things go bad for space technician Elster, but she made a promise she intends to keep. We’ll get back to this later. First up: Signalis excels at capturing the essence of survival horror - those juxtaposed feelings of possibility and unease that hit you entering a long hallway, flanked by doors, only to find all but two locked or malfunctioning. You’ll be back here soon enough, you know that. Probably with a new key. Maybe with a new gun. But there’s also a good chance things will have…changed, by then. A floor tile might reveal new horrors. You might have spent your last bullet. So, left or right? Or maybe back? You can only carry six items, after all.

All this with PCIe 5.0 and DDR5 support, given the right motherboard - and this is a surprisingly great way to jump on 12th-gen, while leaving plenty of space to upgrade to a higher tier CPU down the road.

        <updated>2022-11-01T19:30:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to a Bloomberg report, video game publisher Embracer has shut down Onoma, the studio formerly known as Square Enix Montreal, just months after its acquisition. Some staff will be transferred to Eidos Montreal, another studio owned by Embracer. This news comes just a few weeks after Onoma underwent a rebranding process where it adopted the new name.
Onoma was best known for its work on the Go series, turn-based spin-offs of popular Eidos Interactive titles designed for mobile. This includes Hitman Go, Lara Croft Go, and Deus Ex Go. Their most recent work was Tomb Raider Reloaded, which came to mobile devices earlier this year, and their future plans involved a title based on Avatar: The Last Airbender.
Earlier this year, Onoma was just one part of a much larger series of Embracer’s acquisitions, which included Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montreal. In August, Embracer proceeded to acquire Limited Run Games, Tripwire Interactive, Tuxedo Labs, the IP rights to The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, and several more studios.
The Bloomberg report also says that the closure is part of a cost-cutting initiative, and that Eidos Montreal will have projects scaled back and cut as well. Some of these resources will be redirected to assist in the development of a game in the Fable franchise, led by Playground Games.

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II is a very unpleasant game. Like every Call of Duty game, the majority of time spent playing involves either killing or being killed in horrendous ways, for one thing, and there’s a natural revulsion that comes from seeing so many gouts of blood shooting from bodies or the ragged slump of newly lifeless human corpses piled up in a doorway. And yet, the surface-level hideousness of its parade of death might not be so notably ugly if it wasn't for Modern Warfare II's cast of c…]]></summary>

I desperately need a game to sink into, basically Lo-fi Hip Hop Beats to Relax/Study To: The Game, or the equivalent of a deep body massage but directly onto my brain. Paradise Marsh has been the exact tonic I’ve needed, a chill bug-collectathon where you wander around pleasant, pastel landscapes discovering lots of fun little curiosities. It’s wonderful.

        <updated>2022-11-01T15:27:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The official Sonic the Hedgehog YouTube channel has uploaded an animated short titled “Sonic Frontiers Prologue: Divergence.” Starring Knuckles, the short reveals how he wound up on the island players explore in Sonic Frontiers. You can watch the six-minute animation in its entirety below.


In the trailer, Knuckles provides a voice-over explanation of his background up until now, including the fact that he was tasked with guarding the Master Emerald, a relic that hasn’t appeared in the Sonic series for quite some time. The trailer ends with Knuckles absolutely demolishing some robots, and while we’ve received no indication that he will be playable in Sonic Frontiers, that sequence makes me hope he will be.
Knuckles has been a core Sonic character for most of the franchise’s existence, so it’s not surprising that he’s making an appearance in the blue blur’s latest adventure. While this animated prologue gives us insight into how he wound up on the island, it’s still not entirely clear why, especially when it comes to the appearance of Sage (a new character introduced in Sonic Frontiers) at the end of the trailer. We’ll have to wait for the full game to find out.
The past month has been full of Sonic news. We got a December 14 release date for Sonic Prime, Sonic Frontiers got a trailer confirming Super Sonic would be playable in the game, and we learned that the Sonic series has sold over 1.5 billion copies worldwide. For more Sonic news, check out our cover story from earlier this year, and stay tuned for more Sonic Frontiers coverage when the game releases on November 8.]]></summary>

This primarily gets you the ad-free version of the site (alongside some other small quality of life bonuses), but after listening to your feedback, it's clear that the thing you really want to sample is the exclusive Premium-tier supporter articles we write alongside our regular games coverage. So we're doing just that. 
For the month of November, we'll be making a selection of supporter articles available to all Standard subscribers. We've also made a bunch of Sin Vega's indie-focused Scout Report posts available to all Standard subscribers right now, too, as a little extra thank you for signing up. And to all our existing Premium tier supporters, we've got something for you as well. As an even bigger thank you for all your continued support, we're doing a bumper crop of supporter articles this month, with the aim of publishing one each day of the week for the whole of November.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Avast your behind, hen, for a new month means a new lineup of PC Game Pass games. Microsoft today laid out the comings and goings for the first half of November, headlined by Return To Monkey Island. The revival of the revered point 'n' click adventure game series will hit Game Pass next week, and until then you can tide yourself over with modernistic adventures from more of Telltale's The Walking Dead. Read on for the rest of the games coming in the next fortnight, including some on their launch day, and those sadly leaving too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Salt & Pixel and publisher VoxPop Games have revealed Outer Terror, a new arcade bullet hell with roguelite elements coming to PC soon. That's because its release is set for sometime this year, and given there are only two months left in 2022, it sounds like we won't have to wait too long to check it out. 
Outer Terror's inspirations are clear from the jump: pulpy horror comics and B-movie horror from the 1980s and 1990s with a dash of arcade fun thrown in for good measure. In the game, you'll choose from one of 10 survivors to control, each with their own unique weapons and skills, to face off against waves of enemies. You can play by yourself, but you can also team up with a friend via two-player co-op.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mount & Blade 2 Colon Bannerlord is disappointing. I'm not saying it's bad. In fact, it's overall pretty good, but too much of Bannerlord's design is exactly the same as it was in Warband, and the bulk of what's been added is extraneous strategy guff that doesn't meaningfully improve it at all.
In between leading your warband around its 2D map and stabbing dudes alongside your men in 3D battles, you can now make weapons by commandeering local workshops (I guess?) to break down and recombine spare swords. You can only do a few per day, so the pattern is to repeatedly click "make charcoal", then leave to rest your tired little arms and repeat. I could probably get a more ~optimal build~ by smithing a megasword, but the one I have already does what I need. You can’t equip your army, even though that was in the very ropey Freeman. The end result is another axe in a game where you'll discard hundreds of them. You can't do armour, a huge waste considering the variety available, and that you spend vastly more time seeing your outfits than looking at anyone's pommel.

We already knew about Motive Studios’ single-player Iron Man action adventure game, announced in September, but the others are still just an amorphous blob of creativity that probably gives you the proportionate strength and speed of a badger on physical contact. The revelation that EA and Marvel are forging some kind of Marvel Gaming Universe may delight or frustrate you, depending on how fed up you are with the MCU.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The AMD Ryzen 7 5800X is a good gaming CPU with better content creation performance than the more expensive 5800X3D - even though it's slower than the X3D in gaming. Still, at its price point it hits a punch, and the boffins at HUKD have spotted a good deal for the 5800X at CCL. There, you can find the 5800X for £235 when you use code AFF15 with some nifty extras: a 64GB Micro SD card and a code for Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves. 
The way it works is pretty simple - you need to get your total basket over £250 for the AFF15 code to work. So, pick anything on the store that's more than £5.51, like this Micro SD card, add it to your basket alongside the 5800X, then use the AFF15 code to bring the price down to the £235 we quoted. The game code will come with your order, no opt-in necessary, from what we understand.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spry Fox, the developer of games like Cozy Grove and Alphabears, is joining Netflix games to become the company’s sixth in-house game studio. The news was announced through a blog post on the Spry Fox website, which also answers some questions about the future of the studio.
Spry Fox says the partnership will not change any of their upcoming plans, meaning that Cozy Grove 2 and their unnamed non-violent MMO will still be developed as planned. Instead, Netflix will provide them with financial support, which Spry Fox says will allow them to “stop stressing” about how their games will generate profit. Despite all of Netflix’s current games existing through their mobile app, the blog post does not mention anything about platform exclusivity.
Spry Fox joins five other in-house game developers at Netflix: Next Games (Stranger Things: Puzzle Tales), Night School Studio (Oxenfree), Boss Fight Entertainment (Dungeon Boss), and two internal studios in Helsinki, Finland and southern California.
Netflix launched its games collection just over a year ago, in November of 2021. Currently, subscribers can play over 30 games on their mobile app, including Into the Breach, Spiritfarer, and Poinpy. On top of that, Netflix has over 50 more games in development. Have you had a chance to play any games on the Netflix app? Let us know in the comments.]]></summary>

The game is structured into four square panels in a two-by-two grid. Players can move around each of the squares to solve puzzles or click inside each square to interact with the scene. This is where it gets cool: Any object you see that has some sort of frame around it - doorways, paintings, windows, photographs - you can actually move through them and discover new areas to explore.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Canny Overwatch 2 players have reported more success in obtaining skins by grinding for in-game gold in Blizzard’s long-running fantasy MMO World Of Warcraft and converting that into Battle.net balance than by completing weekly challenges in the hero shooter itself. The trick involves trading gold farmed in WOW for tokens that convert to Battle.net balance, which can then be spent on Overwatch 2 cosmetics. It’s a cunning ploy that speaks volumes about player frustration with the multiplayer shooter’s new free to play mechanics, a situation that might still change if Blizzard listen to results of a recent survey.

        <updated>2022-10-31T16:42:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Electronic Arts' Motive Studios announced its Iron Man game in September, we learned it would be the first of a multi-game deal between the publisher and Marvel. That was a vaguely defined arrangement at the time, but we now know the partnership will produce a minimum of three titles.
EA announced the news in a press release, with the publisher describing it as a “long-term” deal that could extend beyond three games based on the wording. The release also specifies these titles will be action-adventure games for consoles and PC, each featuring original stories in the Marvel universe. 
It's worth clarifying that EA is not getting exclusive rights to Marvel like it had with Star Wars. There are multiple Marvel games in the works at various studios, including the recently announced Captain America/Black Panther game from Amy Hennig’s Skydance New Media. 
“We have been long-time fans of Marvel and their impressive leadership, so this is a remarkable moment for our developers as well as our players and fans,” said EA COO Laura Miele. “We look forward to welcoming Marvel into the EA family of creators and know this collaboration will produce exceptional experiences for our players. We can’t wait to see players' reactions when they suit up as Iron Man and do the extraordinary things this Super Hero is known for.”
We’re curious to learn what other Marvel projects are on the docket and which EA studios are behind them. Motive’s Iron Man, a single-player third-person action game, is currently in pre-production, so it’s a long way from release (the team is also making the Dead Space remake). What heroes would you like to see EA tackle, and which studio do you want to see bring them to life? Let us know in the comments.]]></summary>

The admission came as part of a response to players asking for more support characters in Overwatch 2, as there are currently only eight of them to pick from right now, versus the ten tanks and whopping 16 damage characters in its overall roster. It's not just the number of supports Blizzard have been thinking about either. Over the weekend, it also emerged the Overwatch 2 devs are sending out a survey to current players, with emphasis on the game’s store and the divisive battle pass introduced when the series went free to play. The developments follow on from hero balance changes being brought forward from season two to mid-November.

We seek out spooks even in the heat of summer, and know there's no better mid-winter warmer than a good ghost story. So what are we to do to make this occasion still feel special?
I know common wisdom considers Halloween to be "Goth Christmas", but in my experience goths bloody love Christmas as much as the next person. They are, however, far more likely to be agnostic on the subject of Valentine's Day. Yes, I have spent far too long thinking about this, but I'm determined to stand by my conclusions, thereby dubbing this holiday "Goth Valentine's". Which leads me neatly into the purpose of this feature: games that let you date the monster.

What you’ll find here, then, are SSD offers with genuine discounts only – and with both lightspeed-fast NVMe SSDs and affordable SATA SSDs on early sales, there's something for all kinds of PC builds.

Last year I cut my hand on a CPU cooler radiator. And did you see how dusty my PC was before I cleaned it? That’s basically body horror.
Apparently ignorant of their products’ ability to frighten and maim, PC gaming hardware makers sometimes try to manufacture an imposing aura by giving them big, bad names. You’ve probably seen these already: keyboards named after swords, laptops christened as mythical animals and the like. But some go full spooky, consulting the Halloween kids’ costume pantheon of creatures and creepers. Is an eerie moniker enough to strike fear, even before it has the chance to cause minor injuries or force you into a tedious warranty replacement process? Let’s find out.

Hm. Too late now! Plus, witches are totally Halloween fodder - and they're one of my key trends for games at the moment. Video games are lousy with both current and upcoming witches these days.
It makes sense. They've already got brilliant marketing. Few Halloween-y sights are more iconic than a pointy hat, a black cat, and a sihouetted figure flying in front of the moon on a broomstick. The witches I've collected here are definitely going to get you in the pumpkin spirit, even if they manage to run through most other genres except horror... Look, Halloween is mostly about sweets and dressing up these days anyway (and by the way, I am livid that I've not got any parties to go to this year, because my hair is exactly the right length to do a perfect Carmy Berzatto costume).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The original Butterfly Soup is named for its ending monologue. Its four main characters, Diya, Min-seo, Noelle, and Akarsha, use the liquefaction of a caterpillar inside a cocoon as a metaphor for the awkward teenage growing phase they’re all in. In the sequel, set a few months later, they find a butterfly with a crumpled wing. It’s a victim of a false spring, having emerged from its cocoon too early due to unseasonably warm weather. One of them worries that they are like the injured insect; forever marked by their early life. And it’s this that Butterfly Soup 2 digs into much more deeply than its predecessor.
If you’re not familiar with the original, Butterfly Soup is a visual novel about four Asian girls navigating high school in the late 2000s, playing baseball, and falling in love. On replaying it to get ready for this review, it made me cry at least twice and laugh out loud a bunch more. It’s pay what you want with no minimum price, and takes about 2-3 hours. I’m also going to spoil parts of it, so go play it already.

I'm currently competing for the title of trickster-in-chief here at RPS, and I'm never going to have a chance of receiving this promotion unless I reach my daily scare quota. If only there was a way I could package together a collection of scary stories as told my colleagues and claim them all as my own.

Aha! I got you again! They don't call me the Merry Trickster Of UK PC Gaming Websites for nothing! You've been Halloween'd, my friends! To celebrate spooky season, I gathered seven members of the RPS treehouse to tell me about one moment from a PC game that scared them the most. The results were exactly as I expected. Some recounted events in classic horror games that shocked them senseless, whereas others told me anecdotes about games that most wouldn't consider scary at all. The result is seven tales of spooks that are sure to chill your bones this All Hallows' Eve.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remember Mewgenics? The wacky cat-breeding roguelike is the brainchild of Super Meat Boy co-creator and The Binding of Isaac mastermind Edmund McMillen and has been in and out of the works for a decade. After being announced, put on hold, and restarted, it appears to have a new release window. 
McMillen tweeted a gif of two of the game’s adorable cats engaging in what we'll call an intimate cat exercise. The tweet links to the game’s Steam page, which lists a 2024 release window.

October 28, 2022
What the heck is Mewgenics? The game tasks players with collecting and breeding hundreds of cats to train and send into battle. Or, as the Steam description puts it, Mewgenics is a “turn-based legacy roguelike draft sim about cats!” The game apparently boasts “100s of hours” of gameplay, multiple classes with over 50 unique abilities, over 200 enemies, and other features. 
Mewgenics was first announced in 2012, with McMillen at the time describing it as "By far the strangest project I've ever worked on.” McMillen has worked on it alongside Tyler Glaiel; the pair previously partnered for The End is Nigh, among other titles. The game was originally billed as a cross between Pokémon, The Sims, and Animal Crossing, and had first been planned to release in 2014. It was, of course, delayed, and its development was put on indefinite hold in 2016 when McMillen began work on The Legend of Bum-Bo, which launched in 2019. At the time, McMillen was unsure of Mewgenics’ future, but in 2018 he announced he was remaking the game to be released in “a few years.” 
The game is slated to launch for PC, though whether or not it’s still coming to iOS is unknown. Are you still interested in Mewgenics? Let us know in the comments! For more on Edmund McMillen, we spoke with him last December where he discussed his life and career, including Mewgenics, which you can read in this interview feature.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Pokémon Scarlet and Violet right around the corner, The Pokémon Company is releasing a new expansion in its Sword and Shield series. Silver Tempest stars Alolan Vulpix on the key art, but monsters like Lugia, Serperior, Ho-Oh, and Mawile share the spotlight. Meanwhile, players can expect cards starring Regieleki and Regidrago.
The Pokémon Company sent us several booster packs so we could open them and see what we pull. While it may just be dumb luck, I feel like this expansion gave me better pulls than any others in recent memory. As I cracked these open, I was met with several attractive full-art cards, as well as some gorgeous Trainer Gallery cards. I even managed to pull two of the three new Radiant Pokémon cards. 
This expansion adds over 190 cards to the ever-growing library of Pokémon cards. That number includes 6 Pokémon VSTAR cards, 15 Pokémon V cards, 1 Pokémon VMAX card, 30 special art Trainer Gallery cards, and more than 15 Trainer cards. You can see my favorite pulls from this expansion below.

Pokémon Trading Card Game: Sword and Shield – Silver Tempest launches on November 11. For all things Pokémon Trading Card Game, head to our special hub by clicking on the banner below!]]></summary>

Since its launch in 2019, Apple Arcade has spoiled me so thoroughly with its beautifully crafted, ad-free experience that it’s hard to go back to anything else. To my surprise, this month saw the release of a game that fits both of these criteria: Marvel Snap. I downloaded it a few days ago and haven’t put it down since.
Marvel Snap is a free-to-play deck-builder with very short matches (usually only three to four minutes). As you play, you collect cards adorned with Marvel characters, each with a unique ability. Characters range from mainstream heroes like Hulk and Iron Man to ones I’ve never even heard of, like Ka-Zar or Blue Marvel. At only 12 cards, decks are relatively small, so every character counts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remakes tend to be more exciting than remasters because the improvements often go beyond mere bumps in resolution or framerate. At best, studios reimagine classic experiences in exciting new ways, sand away rough edges, and somehow retain the intangible x-factors that made fans fall in love with these titles in the first place. At the very least, remakes offer a great way to play antiquated or less accessible experiences on modern hardware. 
The remake boom has been in full swing in recent years to the point that it’s starting to get tough to keep track of all the projects in the works. Thankfully, we’ve gathered as many of the announced remakes (not remasters) that we could find and gathered them in one neat list, arranged chronologically by release window.

Tiny Roar describes the game as a "soothing and zany building and exploration game where you place tiles to expand your world with small adventures and big surprises for your characters to uncover." Using these tiles, you can create a "unique story-multiverse" at your own pace. If you want to play fast and loose, you can; if you want to play it strategically, laying out every tile in such a way that your story plan goes off flawlessly, you can do that too, it seems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paranormal Tales is an upcoming indie horror game with a unique perspective twist. Players experience the first-person adventure through the lens of a body camera to provide a more realistic, claustrophobic trek into its terrifying world. 
The game, created by two designers, draws inspiration from found footage films. The name shares the same initials as P.T., which I can’t imagine is coincidental. Players explore a series of video files as they control a person searching for their lost dog, Teddy. Expect to encounter some very creepy phenomena, and the realistic graphics (rendered in Unreal Engine 5) aim to sell the bodycam perspective effectively. Check out the trailer below if you're looking to raise a few hairs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Callisto Protocol's Japanese version has been canceled due to the game's violent content and the rating it received in Japan, or lack thereof, as a result. 
This news comes from The Callisto Protocol's Japanese Twitter account, which reveals that the game could not achieve an age rating with CERO (which is Japan's equivalent to the United States' ESRB rating). As a result, it cannot be allowed to release as is in the country. Here's what the studio had to say, as translated by Eurogamer. 


"The Callisto Protocol has decided to stop the release of the Japanese version. As of now, the CERO rating cannot be passed. We have decided that we would no longer be able to provide you with the experience you need. We hope everyone in Japan will understand. If you have already preordered, we will refund you."

October 26, 2022
As you can see, The Callisto Protocol will not be releasing in Japan as it seems Striking Distance does not want to change or edit the content of its game to fall more in line with CERO ratings. Given how terrifying Japanese horror can be, it seems The Callisto Protocol is cooking up something scary.

The experience comes from Jumpship, a studio founded by Dino Patti, former CEO of Limbo and Inside developer Playdead. That shared DNA is evident in Somerville’s somber, surreal atmosphere. The game centers on a rural family – a father, mother, and child – whose lives get turned upside down by a cataclysmic event involving extraterrestrial visitors. The journey unfolds as a side-scrolling adventure game where the family must survive this apocalypse as it rips through small towns and beyond. You can watch the most recent trailer below.


Somerville was first unveiled during E3 2021 and most recently popped up during last December's Game Awards. The game will be available on Xbox consoles (including Game Pass) and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rieko Kodama, the pioneering Sega developer behind titles like Phantasy Star and Skies of Arcadia, has died at 58. 
Nick Thorpe, features editor for Retro Gaming Magazine, noticed that in the credits for Sega's Mega Drive Mini II, there's a message that reads, "In memory of Rieko Kodama." Twitter user Ares Arcadia quote-tweeted Thorpe's tweet to ask Sega producer Yosuke Okunari if this message means that Kodama had died to which Okunari replied and said, "As you understand it. We respected her," confirming her death. 
Sega has since confirmed Kodama's death, citing that she had passed in May, according to IGN. Further details around her death will not be shared out of respect for her family's privacy, Sega says. 
"We pray that the deceased will rest in peace, and we offer our gratitude for her enormous contributions to Sega," Sega of Japan says, as translated by IGN Japan. 
Kodama's journey through game development began in the 1980s when she started as a graphic designer for Master System and Sega Genesis games like Altered Beast and Sonic the Hedgehog. She was the main artist for Phantasy Star and continued to work on the series' visuals team until Phantasy Star IV: The End of the Millennium, which she directed.
Other credits include Mega Drive versions of Sorcerian, Alex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, and more. After directing Phantasy Star IV, she directed Magic Knight Rayearth in 1995 before becoming a producer and development lead on Sega's Skies of Arcadia. She continued to work in games development in some capacity until at least 2018, where she was the lead producer on the Sega compilation title Sega Ages. 
In 2019, she was recognized with the Pioneer Award at GDC 2019. 
The staff at Game Informer extends their condolences to Kodama's family.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rocksteady Studios co-founders Sefton Hill and Jamie Walker have announced that they are departing from the studio. 
This news comes as a bit of a surprise, both because Hill was the director of the studio's upcoming game, Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League, and because both were original founders of the studio and masterminds behind its popular Batman Arkham series. Nonetheless, it seems the two are leaving Rocksteady amicably at the end of the year with confidence in the team they're leaving behind to carry Suicide Squad across the finish line. 
Here is the statement in full: 
- Jamie Walker & Sefton Hill

“Having worked with Jamie and Sefton as one of the founding members of the studio, I want to thank them for creating what I consider to be one of the best games development studios…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this month, CD Projekt Red announced that it was developing a new Cyberpunk game, multiple Witcher games, and a new IP. One of those Witcher games was given the codename "Canis Majoris" and CDPR called it a "full-fledged" Witcher title. Now, the company has revealed that "Canis Majoris" is actually a remake of the very first Witcher game. 
The official Witcher Twitter account posted the news this morning, revealing that CDPR is working with developer Fool's Theory to make The Witcher using Unreal Engine 5. Fool's Theory developed Seven Enhanced Edition and Seven Drowned Pass, but it has also provided developmental support on games like Divinity: Original Sin II, Baldur's Gate III, and Outriders.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Team Ninja has revealed the release date for its upcoming action game set during the Three Kingdoms era of China, Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, and it's less than half a year away. 
More specifically, the studio has revealed that Wo Long will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on March 3, 2023. That's less than six months away. Alongside this news, Team Ninja has detailed the editions of Wo Long you can preorder as well as some of the DLC coming to the game.


Let's break those editions down: 
Standard Edition
The physical version of the game will include the Baihu armor as an early purchase bonus.
The digital version of the game will include the Zhuque armor as a digital pre-order bonus and the Baihu armor as an early purchase bonus. 
Steelbook Launch Edition
The steelbook launch edition of the game will include Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, a collector's steelbook (yet to be revealed), and the Crown of Zhurong and Crown of Gonggong bonus DLC. It will also include the Baihu armor as an early purchase bonus. 
Digital Deluxe Edition
The digital deluxe edition will include a digital copy of Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, a digital art book, a digital mini soundtrack, and the game's season pass. It will also include the Quinglong armor as a season pass bonus, the Baihu armor as an early purchase bonus, and the Zhuque armor as a digital pre-order bonus. 
DLC
Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty will have a season pass and it will include three pieces of DLC, although Team Ninja has not detailed what to expect just yet. You can also buy these DLCs individually. Anyone that purchases the season pass will get the Qinglong armor as a bonus. 
For more about Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, be sure to check out the game's terrifying reveal trailer from earlier this year, and then watch this gameplay trailer that shows off some stylish demon slaying.

Bethesda Game Studios announced back in 2020 that it was teaming up with Amazon Studios and Kilter Films to develop a Fallout TV series. Early details revealed that Westworld creators and producers Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy signed onto the project and are partnering with Fallout 4 director and long-time Bethesda producer Todd Howard to bring the show to life.
Since then, not much else has been released except a 2021 report that details the show as a "gonzo, crazy, funny adventure" and some leaked set photos that reveal some pretty accurate set designs and costumes. However, today, in celebration of Fallout's …]]></summary>

More specifically, Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition, the 2019 remaster of the original 1999 Age of Empires II release, is coming to Xbox consoles on January 31, 2023, and it will be followed by an Xbox release of Age of Empires IV later that year.

Check out the announcement video for yourself below: 


That's not all that was revealed today, though. If you're an Age of Empires fiend, check out this video breaking down the history of the series that the Xbox and the Age of Empires team released today: 


Xbox, World's Edge, and Relic Entertainment have also revealed Age of Mythology Retold, a definitive edition of the Age of Empires spin-off series first released in 2002. Check out its reveal trailer below: 


"Age of Mythology Retold is in production," the announcement reads. "We know that the Age of Mythology community has been waiting hopefully for a Definitive Edition, and we'll be delivering. We're working hard to bring you the glory of the original game with updated graphics, features, and more." 
Next up is the reveal that Age of Empires is heading to mobile devices. Not much was revealed, but you can check out the teaser trailer for the game below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A trailer from the Pokémon Company International has revealed the Greavard, the Ghost Dog Pokémon, just in time for Halloween. You can watch the official reveal below.


On Twitter, the official Pokémon account describes this haunted hound with the following Pokédex-like entry:
That second sentence ties into the first part of this reveal – an animated video posted on the Pokémon YouTube Channel about a trainer searching the Paldea region for ghost-type Pokémon. They eventually stumble upon a Greavard, but mysteriously collapse after playing fetch.
Greavard’s reveal continues a trend in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s marketing campaign where they post animated teasers and reveals of each new monster coming to the games. It started with Grafaiai and has continued all the way up to Bellibolt, a Pokémon revealed less than two weeks ago.
If you’re hungry for more Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, check out our hands-on preview, or watch the games’ most recent trailer here.
