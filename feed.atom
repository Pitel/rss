After the rather excellent Tomb Raider I-III Remastered landed on Switch earlier this year, we wondered whether the Darkness Trilogy would end up getting the same treatment. Well, it is! Aspyr has today announced that Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered will be heading to the Nintendo hybrid exactly one year after its predecessor on 14th February 2025.
Compiling The Last Revelation, Chronicles and Angel of Darkness, this follow-up collection appears to have the same updated visuals as its predecessor — and the ability to switch between the polygonal and modern styles returns too.

Stablemate Europa Universalis 4 has 37 DLC packs under its banner, while Cities Skylines is streets ahead with a whopping 62. Paradox Interactive have long built their core game business around putative forever-projects that trail an enormous mantle of paid expansions. It's seemingly this, as much as their institutional expertise with 4X, that justifies their commitment to grand strategy games, whose worlds and systems can be fleshed out for literal decades.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Rod of Kepeleke is one of the new Unique weapons that have been added to Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred. It’s going to be a very popular pick for all the Spiritborns out there because of its versatility for many top-tier builds right now.


That being said, if you want to get this for your class, here’s what you’ll need to know.


How to get the Rod of Kepeleke in Diablo 4


The Rod of Kepeleke can be obtained by defeating Duriel or Andariel. They are the strongest ladder bosses in the game and can take quite some time to get there, let alone target farm.


If you are far from this point in the game and do want to get the Rod of Kepeleke a lot sooner, there are easier, but less efficient ways of doing so.


The first method is to farm the Infernal Hordes. If you rack up enough Aether, you can open up the big chest in the middle to obtain better rewards. It won’t be guaranteed, but you have a higher likelihood of obtaining one of the many Unique items for your Spiritborn.


Screenshot by Destructoid


You can also farm Nightmare Dungeons and The Pit at levels above 35 to consistently gain more Uniques. Once again, it isn’t guaranteed, but better gear starts dropping once you hit higher Torment tiers because of loot modifiers.


One of the better methods aside from those above would be to gamble Obols. That’s right. Gather a lot of Obols, preferably close to your maximum limit, then trade them to a Purveyor of Curiosities. Gamble them specifically for Quarterstaffs.


While you’re at it, allocate any spare Season Blessings to the Urn of Curiosities to increase your chances of getting two weapons for one roll. It’ll heavily increase your chances of getting the weapon.

        <updated>2024-10-11T12:56:17.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The one thing about the original Doom and Doom 2 was they really liked to emphasize the dreary colors to match the guttural 90s violence. Combined with some of the murkier, bloodier hellscape levels, id Software's iconic series is not exactly known for its liberal use of bright colors.


Until now, that is. As you can see, ModDB user DoomMate is currently in the midst of creating a mod for Doom 2 that can only be described as "neon." While it's still a work-in-progress, "Volt Laser" is promising a large selection of custom maps that have taken cues from a more synthwave/cyberpunk aesthetic.




This "megawad" will contain 35 levels, featuring a city, underground, some outskirts, and more. You can see the progress that's been made in the video above, and I, for one, am looking forward to running around maps that have purple floors and teal buttons.


Deus-Doom? System Doom?


As mentioned, "Volt Laser" is still being worked on. Its creator did say they wanted it out by November, but have had to delay releasing the mod due to other commitments. At this time, there's no definite launch day, but it should hopefully be before the end of the year.


However, DoomMate did post recently with some updates from the project, including some more images. I don't know about you, but that skyline in the distance is giving me mad original Deus Ex vibes. Or some other throwback piece of dystopian science fiction.


In any case, I'm here for it. Honestly, I'll be surprised if I ever get bored of seeing Doom mods. We've all played the games to death and I know I go on about fan-made content a lot, but if I had even an iota of investment and talent as a lot of modders do, you wouldn't be reading this article right now.

If you’re reading this on October 11th 2024, then 30 years ago today Final Fantasy 3 (aka VI) was released in North America. A lot of memorable games (Super Metroid, DKC, Earthworm Jim, Ridge Racer, and Doom II, to name a few) turn 30 this year, but Final Fantasy VI stands out to me because I was privileged to play and beat it a couple of months before its official release.
And, no, I didn’t simply import and play the Japanese version that had been released six months prior. In the summer of 1994, as a fresh-faced, 16-year-old kid, I played to completion an official, pre-release build of the English version.

This review was originally published in January 2015. We're updating and republishing it to mark the arrival of GP Legend (and Climax, which was never released in the West) in the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack GBA library.

The F-Zero series has often dished out a steep challenge, and in GP Legend the uninitiated will be given no quarter unless they dig in their heels and learn the ropes. You're expected to tame every brutal hairpin, memorise each risky shortcut, and etch sweet boosting spots into your brain if you are to succeed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You have woken to the sound of multiple former Disco Elysium developers arguing inside your own skull. They are bickering about whose game is the true spiritual successor to the rockbottom detective RPG. Is it the unnamed project announced earlier today by new studio Longdue, involving some kind of "psychogeography mechanic"? Or is it this one, XXX Nightshift, a cerebral sci-fi RPG set in a posh polar hotel about a detective "solving gruesome murders, breaking sacred hearts, or just killing bloody time"? It's not for me to choose the dialogue option now appearing in your own brain. But I will say this: at least the one with the horny name has a trailer.

A new studio called Longdue has been formed by developers from ZA/UM, Bungie, Rockstar, and Brave at Night with the intention to create a 'spiritual successor' to the critically-acclaimed CRPG Disco Elysium.
Precious few details regarding the project are available at the moment bar a single piece of concept art which you can view below, but the project is said to continue the legacy of Disco Elysium while also introducing a new, groundbreaking ‘psychogeographic RPG’ mechanic. Essentially, it means that your decisions in the game will not only affect the people around you, but also the environment, with your charatcer's psyche constantly shifting with the landscape around you.

They did, however, confirm that Disco Elysium's lead writer and designer Robert Kurvitz and art director Aleksander Rostov are not involved.

I’ll move on from his large majesty for a moment though, because it isn’t the only thing this one looks to have going for it. 
It’s a single player action RPG, to start with - a genre I’m always interested in watching evolve in ways not tied to its usual form as a good-boy-points-vomiting loot casino. It’s also based on Slavic folklore, something that’s not too uncommon but strikes a wonderful mix between blackly funny whimsy and intense dread when done right. Also, I’ll take more discordant folk music any time. Trailer below.

Apart from the return of Dragon Quest III this November, Square Enix is also planning on reviving Dragon Quest I & II as a special HD-2D Remake. For heroes planning on playing through these titles in the true chronological order, it seems you'll be rewarded with a little bit extra at the end.
Speaking at the Tokyo Game Show 2024, the series' creator Yuji Horii apparently hinted at how the first two titles would include some additional elements including a "new discovery" and a "bit of a surprise" (Famitsu via Automaton).

How to get Insurmountable in Destiny 2


Insurmountable, like all of the other Revenant weapons, can be acquired by participating in seasonal events. At the time of this writing, these will be the two Onslaught modes found in The Last City. Additionally, it can be found via rank up rewards from Eido. To maximize this, I recommend equipping four pieces of the seasonal gear as they provide a rep gain bonus.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Episode 2: Revenant of Destiny 2 has an incredibly lengthy intro. As your favorite Eliksni make their appearances, you'll be guided through the foundation for how this episode will work. One critical part is performing fieldwork with and for Eido. Yet, finding the Act I Fieldwork tab is surprisingly tricky.


How to access the Act I Fieldwork Tab in Revenant


To access the Act I Fieldwork Tab, speak to Eido in her apothecary in The Last City. It's the green icon with the potion on it. Once accessed, you'll see three categories: Minor Fieldwork, Major Fieldwork, and Key Fieldwork.


Image by Destructoid


The problem many players, including myself, run into at this part is the instructions at the bottom of the screen never go away despite accessing the tab. By the time it appeared for me, I had already acquired the fieldwork and was ready to go. The fix for this bug is as simple as returning to orbit.


This bug has persisted in various forms for the past several years. It's annoying, to be sure, but once you learn to recognize it, the "fix" is easy. It serves as a painful reminder that Bungie leadership doesn't have its priorities straight, and the remaining staff's talents are being misused. 


As for the fieldwork itself, it's fairly simple to complete. The first two involve going to Europa and recovering lost items while laying waste to enemies inside a Lost Sector and completing world tasks. I don't mind any excuse to head back to the frozen moon of Jupiter, especially if I'm wielding what is essentially a frozen stake thrower.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Emblems in Destiny 2 are a great way to stand out from the crowd and give other players a glimpse of what they're getting when you roll into the fireteam. For some, emblems are another thing to collect in a game where FOMO sweetens that chase. So, when the Life for Life emblem was shown off in 2022 with no way to obtain it, some were salivating. Here's how to get it.


Where to get the Life for Life Emblem in Destiny 2


Two years after its release, players can finally obtain the Life for Life emblem by visiting Master Rahool in The Tower. While you're there, make sure to visit the Special Deliveries Terminal for the following rewards (if you've purchased the season pass):



Arcology Vault Shell (Exotic Ghost Shell)


(3) Ascendant Alloy


(4) Ascendant Shard


(1) Exotic Cipher


(7) Upgrade Module



Screenshot by Destructoid


The Life for Life emblem was added in February 2022 with Season of the Risen. However, there was a small catch, as the emblem couldn't actually be obtained. Bungie would acknowledge this six months later in a TWAB. Two and a half years later, Bungie finally made good and included the Life for Life emblem.


I'll admit that it took me a hot minute to figure out what the icon in the emblem was. Then I remembered when Crow accidentally killed one of Empress Caiatl's most trusted psions. Ah, good times. It's why Lord Saladin is now bound to the Cabal and goes by the moniker of Valus Forge. So, in a season where we're still cleaning up Uldren Sov's messes, it's humorous that we get a reminder of his reborn self's goofs.

Revenant's hand cannon, Exuviae, can also be defined as the shed exoskeleton of ecdysozoans. Do the Eliksni shed their carapaces? Who knows? Either way, that's some good food for thought while you chase this hand cannons God Rolls.


How to get Exuviae in Destiny 2


Exuviae can be acquired by completing Revenant seasonal activities. At the time of this writing, those are primarily the new Onslaught modes accessed via The Last City. It also has a chance to appear in rank-up engrams from Eido. Equip the seasonal armor to boost your rep gains with Crabcakes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This feels like the year of stop-motion animation games. Harold Halibut and Judero are about to yield the limelight to The Spirit of the Samurai, confirmed with a December 12, 2024 launch date. Sharpen those swords and ready those warrior cats, folks. 


Wait, warrior cats? That's right. If a harsh and violent samurai Metroidvania with stop-motion-style animation doesn't quite grab your attention (it really should), then know this: There are places where you get to play The Spirit of the Samurai as the viciously adorable warrior cat Chisai. The newest trailer for the game shows Chisai in action, along with its also-cute Kodama partner fighting a grotesque spider.




The Spirit of the Samurai hacks its way to a late 2024 release date


When Chisai isn't being cute and potentially deadly, you will play as the samurai Takeshi, who ventures out to end the Oni rampage. Whereas Chisai is used during climbing and platforming sections, Takeshi must overcome the odds. He does it not by being adorable (sadly) but by killing yokai, Oni, and other demons of Japanese mythology using his katana, bow, and spear. 


The Spirit of the Samurai is a dark and brutal Metroidvania. Its visuals, inspired by the works of famous animator Ray Harryhausen, are harsh and dreary but absolutely gorgeous. Watching the game in motion is a visual treat. If you haven't checked out the trailer yet, you really should.

But you can also wait until next week and try the game out for yourself. A demo for The Spirit of the Samurai will launch on October 14, 2024, for the upcoming Steam Next Fest. I'm not sure what the demo covers, but it'll likely be an early section of the game. Hopefully, it includes some Chisai action. C'mon, you know what we want.


The Spirit of the Samurai launches on PC via Steam on December 12, 2024.

We're here to clear up any confusion with this Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero Dragon Orb guide.


How to get Dragon Orbs in Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero


Dragon Orbs decrease the difficulty of alternative pathways, known as Secondary Clear Conditions. These are additional challenges or objectives within a chapter that, when completed, unlock new storylines or character developments.

It has a lot of the same good stuff, like puppets and flat characters. It also has jokes if your sense of humor hasn’t fallen off.


It’s pretty different, though. It’s still a joy-maker adventure game about helping people out, but Great God Grove bases its puzzles around sucking the words out of someone’s mouth and firing them at someone else. It’s a unique twist on an old formula, and I’m not totally sure how I feel about it, so I’m going to work through my emotions the way I usually do: posting questionable content online.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PowerWash Simulator lives in a niche all of its own, and it sure manages to dominate regardless. Over the past couple of years, FuturLab's surprisingly engaging wash 'em up has played host to all manner of wild DLC, but the new Shrek DLC may well top it all.


"Playtime is ogre," says FuturLab's latest Steam announcement. Featuring pixie-dust cleaners, faerie soap, and the good old-fashioned mops, PowerWash Simulator's new Shrek Special DLC pack takes players on a romp through a classic fantasy franchise. The gist of it all is still much the same, of course, but who could say no to an opportunity to power-wash Shrek's Swamp?

Clean up Shrek's swamp in PowerWash Simulator... for $7,99


Priced at $7,99, Shrek Special is actually seemingly quite loaded with content. There are five maps to clean up in total:



Duloc


Hansel's Honeymoon Hideaway


Shrek's Swamp


Fairy Godmother's Potion Factory


Dragon's Lair



Of course, included is the aforementioned roster of magical cleaning tools and supplies, which puts this DLC at roughly the same ratio of content-per-dollar as all the other PowerWash Simulator DLCs. Content-wise, it seems pretty solid, but there are some problems to keep in mind for the time being.


As of October 10, the current build of the game will apparently lock up and make it impossible to do much of anything in-game if you try to actually clean up any of Shrek's unlikely mud palaces. Even entering menus becomes impossible, so it may pay off to wait until the developer can patch things up. FuturLab has historically been quite good with these matters, so it won't take long before the problems are properly sorted out.


Once that's all been sorted out, though, I've no doubt that Shrek Special will take its rightful place as a worthy alternative to the prior Warhammer 40K, SpongeBob SquarePants, and Tomb Raider DLCs, just to list a few.

In total, five new Incarnons were added with the update's release, and the weapons that received them have effectively been brought back into relevancy. Before I get into them, if you're not sure what an Incarnon weapon is, it is a system introduced into Warframe several updates ago designed to greatly empower old weapons so that they become viable once more.

Space Marine 2 features a cooperative multiplayer PvE mode called Operations.

After you've chosen an Astartes Class and played an Operation or two, you'll find yourself leveling up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While new weapons in Destiny 2 are the focus for most players, sometimes it's good to pick up some old tools of the trade. This is especially true with the launch of Episode: Revenant, where an old raid's weapons were updated to fit more modern standards.


One such weapon is highly sought-after by many players thanks to its strength when it was released. Titan players, especially, are hunting for it. Here's the god roll for the Prophet of Doom shotgun in Destiny 2.


The best perks and attachments for the Prophet of Doom in Destiny 2


Image via Destructoid


The Prophet of Doom sports the Precision Frame archetype, causing its recoil to be far more vertical. This makes the shots easier to control, though that doesn't stop the recoil from being nasty. Thankfully, some of the news perks give us a way to fix that. The following perks do just that and more:



Barrel: Rifled Barrel


Magazine: Assault Mag


Perk 1: Threat Detector


Perk 2: Closing Time



Rifled Barrel brings that handling speed down but provides a healthy bonus to effective range, meaning you won't need to barrel stuff enemies as often. Assault Mag provides some stability to help with that recoil, alongside a healthy rate of fire boost. Threat Detector brings in some nice stability, faster reloads, and counteracts that lost handling if enemies are near you. With a shotgun, that isn't too difficult. Finally, we round things out with Closing Time, which improves the weapon's stats the more you empty the magazine. It's nothing crazy, but it sure helps.


If you're looking for some alternatives, Trench Barrel can be a good alternative for Closing Time if you're a Titan with a melee-focused build. Voltshot can also be good, provided you're in PvE and reload a bullet after every kill. Otherwise, the rest of this setup should be best in class.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As caught by Kotaku, you can already play the masterful remake of Silent Hill 2 without the series' ever-present and all-engulfing fog. Behold, the marvel:


Screenshot via ThatGenericProEric


Though Team Silent originally came up with it just to circumvent the PS1's hardware limitations, the fog present in Silent Hill ended up becoming the series' most iconic element. I'd argue it's even one of gaming's most iconic visual elements, overall. 


Removing the fog from any of the Silent Hill games seems like shooting yourself in the foot with a bazooka, especially since the volumetric fog in the new Silent Hill 2 is one of the most amazing visual effects ever seen in a game. Still, FrancisLouis immediately set out to create a mod that rids the town of fog, and the results are surprisingly neat.










The game sure does lose a lot of what makes it special because the remake’s unique fog is incredible to look at, but it also hides a lot of the graphical prowess of the remake. Another interesting thing you might notice is how the game doesn't get less creepy, it just gets so in a different way. Silent Hill, in the state James visits it in, remains a desolate place filled with creepy crawlies and other inexplicable phenomena, and now they're all in plain sight.










The mod is called "Silent Hill 2 HD Collection", a cheeky reference to the Silent Hill 2 and 3 remasters from 2012 that accidentally did away with most of the games' fog. Those were absolutely awful, but I'm glad they paved the way for this kind of experimenting.




I wouldn’t recommend this mod for a first playthrough, obviously. But, alongside the official no-UI mode and 90s filter, I think this is a pretty neat (and funny) way to experience SH2 and proof that the remake is more than just its spectacular environmental effects.


You can now enjoy Silent Hill 2 on PC and PS5.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Alethonym is the biggest highlight gear wise with Destiny 2's Episode: Revenant launch. Not only is the weapon the second-ever primary ammo grenade launcher, but it can spawn Special and Heavy ammo bricks for both you and your team.


With how solid the weapon is, you might be wondering whether there's a catalyst for it and how it changes its performance. There is a catalyst, but there's a massive caveat. Here's how to get the Alethonym exotic catalyst in Destiny 2.


When to get the Alethonym catalyst in Destiny 2

The Alethonym's catalyst is unobtainable right now. Taking a look at the Season Pass, the catalyst is obtainable at rank 145, which doesn't unlock until Act II's launch. That won't be until the middle of November, so you'll need to wait until then to snag it. On the bright side, the catalyst is part of the free reward track.


As for what the catalyst will do once it's released, Bungie has remained tight-lipped on that front. If we had to wager a guess, it'll likely have something to do with generating Vestiges and building up the charge for that a bit faster. However, it could also be something to do with Stasis crystals or something like that. We're just speculating, though, so take those guesses with a grain of salt.


In the meantime, there are still plenty of other exotic goodies to collect. Take the Rime-Coat Raiments for example, which help with the Warlock's Bleak Watcher turrets a ton.

Curve Shot — Curve Shot is by far the best offensive skill in Vision. It not only works great against real goalkeepers but is also the best move if you want to score against an AI. However, it can be hard to execute.


Nutmeg — Nutmeg is overpowered, and it's surprising that not many people are using it. It allows you to teleport to and dash away from a defender, gaining distance in the process. Use it with Rigid Dribbling to gain even more gr…]]></summary>

We were particularly enamoured by The Eternal Life of Goldman's stunning hand-drawn aesthetic when we first glimpsed it at this year's THQ Nordic Showcase, but today's behind-the-scenes deep dive has seriously blown our socks off.
On paper, this platforming adventure is as charming as they come. There's an adorable elderly protagonist, a mysterious backdrop packed with folklore and fairytale references, and what appears to be a sweet gameplay flow consisting of running, jumping and cane-whacking. But the visuals really are the scene-stealer here, and that's what the publisher's new video is all about.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I will not lie to you, gentle reader. When I first laid eyes on Secret Door's Sunderfolk, while lurking to the rear of a gaggle of journomancers at a preview event last week, I let out an ostentatious sigh. Fortunately, I still mask up to preview events, and am thus free to adopt all kinds of snotty facial expressions without being set upon by burly PRs and shoved into the minifridge for later disposal. To sum it up, Sunderfolk is a hex and turn-based 2-4 player digital boardgame with fantasy animal characters and deckbuilding elements, reminiscent of Gloomhaven. Conceived during the pandemic lockdowns as a way to "bring back game night", but without the traditional 30-minute unboxing ritual, it's played on the big screen but controlled using a dedicated smartphone app, with players stroking and swiping to move characters and play cards.

Released in 2000 with a Dreamcast and GBA launch following soon after, Jedi Power Battles is kind of a cross between platformer and beat 'em up, having you make your way through a variety of stages filled to the brim with classic Star Wars villains.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From Concordia, with love.
Mario & Luigi: Brothership is right around the corner and we are excited. We've been lucky enough to go hands-on with the latest entry in the wacky RPG series and we came away with 15 minutes of crisp new gameplay footage for you to see the Bros. back in action.
The above clips are taken from an early section of the game, showcasing two different islands that Mario & Luigi set out to save in the hopes of reuniting the fractured nation of Concordia. You'll see a decent amount of overworld exploring, some of the turn-based battles with the iconic Bro-specific button inputs and a peppering of the dry humour that we so loved in the series' GBA and DS titles.

Kind Words 2 is full of touching and drifting remarks like this, written by other players and tossed into the winds for you to find. If you're allergic to vulnerability, or find cuteness or the "wholesome" games trend hard to digest, you've probably already turned your face away. But if your heart is open, even a smidge, if you carry a deep craving to peer through the cracks in the internet to discover a small realm of common humanity, then Kind Words 2 can show you a glimpse of that warm and welcoming world.

Nintendo fans over in Japan are going absolutely bonkers over the newly-released Nintendo Sound Clock: Alarmo accessory, causing Nintendo to suspend sales on its official website.
As communicated on social media, the firm has temporarily hit snooze on sales after an alarming (heh!) surge from Nintendo fans across the region. Although Nintendo didn't outright specify whether it had completely run out of Alarmo units, this is likely the case as it states it will "continue to produce the products in order to deliver them to as many customers as possible".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dial L for Luigi.
You would be forgiven for assuming the Mario & Luigi series was no more. It has been nine years since Mario & Luigi: Paper Jam was released as the last new entry. Since then, Superstar Saga and Bowser's Inside Story received 3DS remakes, but then developer AlphaDream shut up shop in 2019 after filing for bankruptcy. In short, we weren't all that hopeful that the Bros. would be back in town any time soon.
Then the June 2024 Nintendo Direct happened, opening, no less, with the announcement that the plumbing pair would be leaping back into action. The Mario & Luigi: Brothership reveal showcased a new art style, plenty of slapstick humour, OTT turn-based shenanigans and bro-specific button inputs — yes, it looked like a Mario & Luigi RPG of old. The question was, would it feel like one? Would it live up to the high bar set by its predecessors, or is that whimsical magic a product of a different handheld generation?

This came a couple of months after the Crusader Kings publisher washed their hands of the sequel's original developers, Double Eleven.
Speaking to me at Paradox's Media Day last week, deputy chief executive officer Mattias Lilja offered a shade more insight on the decision, suggesting that hard-up players have "higher expectations" at present and are less trusting that developers will fix problems. Chief creative officer Henrik Fåhraeus also offered thoughts on what Paradox have learned from the disastrous launch of Cities: Skylines 2 in late 2023. Specifically, he said they need to give actual players access to the game early on, not just testers.

They're also partnering with Ziff Davis again, providing support for Humble's previously released games.

Now in development at The Chinese Room, it'll be an action-RPG with a relatively linear story set in the World Of Darkness universe. This obviously plays to The Chinese Room's strengths - they're better known for melancholy or horrifying strolls through broken spaces than the Dishonorable massaging of intricate systems. But it also reflects Paradox's view that the original Bloodlines has been "mythologised" a bit: people love the memory of it more than the reality, and there are aspects of the 2004 game, according to Paradox's deputy chief executive officer Mattias Lilja, that simply "wouldn't fly today".

        <updated>2024-10-09T11:49:38.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s easy to think of your PC’s RAM as something that just needs to be enough, rather than a powerhouse like the graphics card or CPU. Easy for me, anyway, until testing out the Silent Hill 2 remake this past week served up a reality check: modern games need a lot of memory, and in SH2’s case, might not even get past the Steam launcher if they decide you’re lacking in it. As penance, I’ve found some DDR5 RAM deals in the Prime Big Deal Days sales that should set any modern rig for years and years of... well, games launching properly, I suppose.
As such, while 16GB is the bare minimum you can get away with, I’d recommend 32GB to be safe. For pure value, check out Crucial’s DDR5 Pro set, which I've been using in my own testing setup for a while: it’s down from £140 to £80 on Amazon UK, and down from $150 to $81 on Amazon US. But the single best deal here, I reckon, is Corsair’s Vengeance RGB kit, which the US site has slashed from $130 to $100. That’s the same price as the non-RGB equivalent kit while also being faster, at 6400MHz to 6000MHz. Us UK folk can also get a similar set for £101, down from £147, though that’s set at 6000MHz.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few months ago, Broken Sword creator Charles Cecil walked out of the office of Revolution Software and onto the Shambles, the Diagon Alley-esque street that has survived since York’s days as a medieval trade hub. He closed the door behind him, somewhat grumpily - he’d had to work late, and it was already past eight o’clock. Then a voice piped up behind him.
"And one day, when you get older, you will play Broken Sword," said a young woman to her toddler. "This is where Revolution are based."
Cecil had stumbled across an annual pilgrimage to the site where British point-and-click adventures are made. From the sounds of it, this young woman was not alone in making the journey. Cecil registered Revolution’s office address on Google a year ago - and received an email to say that 40,000 people have checked it out since.
"We’re incredibly blessed to have a really positive and lovely collection of people who want us to succeed and love the games that we write," Cecil says. "We love our interaction with them."
These might read like the words of a good community manager, rather than a man expressing a deeply-held sentiment. Yet Cecil does not take his relationship with Revolution’s fans for granted. At times in his long career, he has lost touch with his audience. And at others, he’s feared they might turn their back on him.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the record, I still think it’s easier and safer to go with a microSD for your Steam Deck storage needs, and with good Prime Big Deal Days savings on two of the best – the Samsung Pro Plus and the SanDisk Ultra – that opinion remains unbudged. Still, you know what they say: when you’re holding a tiny screwdriver, everything starts to look like a tiny screw. So I understand if the call to replace the Deck’s internal SSD, or indeed that of your Asus ROG Ally, proves too strong.
In which case, have a look at the Crucial P310, which I added to our best SSDs list just last week, and is currently joining in the Prime sale frivolities. Specifically, the 1TB model has been slashed from £128 to £70 on Amazon UK, while it’s the 2TB version that gets a US discount, dropping from $265 to $168.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The obvious way of bundling up Beautiful Light is probably "Hunt Showdown meets S.T.A.L.K.E.R.", and whoops, I've already committed to that in the headline. But the first game that came to mind when I chanced on some playtest footage last night was The Town Of Light, LKA's deeply disquieting game about exploring a carefully recreated abandoned asylum.
There's the title overlap, of course - it's always a bit of a provocation when horror games make a point of being well-lit. Beyond that, the two games share an interest in dessicated interiors where chairs huddle disconsolately, where the sun slides through windows whose curtains have rotted away, and the plaster flakes in ways both pretty and macabre. But where The Town Of Light gave you one rambling building's worth of encroaching hallucinations, Beautiful Light gives you a whole wilderness, where the architecture scales from "dreary forgotten school" to "gleaming underground base". It also gives you a lot of guns. Devised by Geneva-based Deep Worlds SA, this is a team extraction shooter where six squads of three gasmasked alpha-bravos compete to retrieve an artifact from a quarantine zone full of deadly anomalies.

The first being the most obvious crime: a captain steering their space freighter into harm's way, entirely on purpose. You're there, staring through the eyes of the person in the cockpit. You open the locker and grab the key and insert it into the safety override panel with a satisfying click. You see the plastic casing spring open and the red button emerge. You press it and listen to the sirens whirr. You grab the steering wheel and yank it.

The colourful game about a troubled arena fighter retiring into a life of lapsang souchong and repressed urges to do sudden violence had previously been planned for a release some time in 2024, according to the developer's original announcement. But game development is, as ever, a fickle destroyer of plans.  "Reading the tea leaves, it has become clear that Wanderstop needs a tiny bit more time to fully bloom," they said in a Steam post yesterday, adding that their new estimate is "early 2025".

And if space is the sole concern, it’s hard to get more substantial than the 1.5TB SanDisk Ultra. Never mind how the header pic shows a 64GB card, the much more desirable 1.5TB version is down from £149 to £100 on Amazon UK and from $150 to $89 on Amazon US. Both of those are very fine bargains indeed, for a card that dwarfs even the biggest SSD options of the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally families.

Despite releasing this year, it’s designed to fit the last-gen AM4 motherboard socket – which sounds strange, because it is, but then the 5700X3D is also the cheapest Ryzen chip to feature AMD’s extremely game-friendly 3D V-Cache tech. The result is a very sprightly processor that’s available for relative chump change, especially now that Prime Big Deal Days has sliced it down to £161 in the UK.

Which is a shame, as the OLED gaming monitors I’ve used have invariably looked sumptuous, without the movement blurring issues you might expect if you own a TV of the same panel tech. Relying on sales events remains the best way to make the switch without bankrupting yourself, as we can see in this Prime Big Deal Days offer: 40%, or £400, off the OLED-powered LG UltraGear 27GR95QE-B.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paradox Interactive have not had a rosy couple of years. While the company's core business in grand strategy remains prosperous, their approach to games outside this niche has been mired by delays, cancelations, closures and layoffs. Let's run through the big setbacks: The Lamplighters League, which we overall liked, was a $22 million financial flop - Paradox have now parted ways with creators Harebrained Studios. Cities Skylines 2 should have been a victory lap, after the success of the first game, but it launched with severe bugs and performance issues. Prison Architect 2, another follow-up to a hit game, has been delayed indefinitely, and Paradox have split from developers Double Eleven. Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is borderline vapourware: originally announced in 2019 with Hardsuit Labs at the helm, it's currently in the hands of The Chinese Room, and was recently delayed for the umpteenth time into 2025.
And then there's the abrupt cancellation of Life By You, a life management sim designed to compete directly with The Sims 4, and the closure of its creators Paradox Tectonic. Writing-down the development of Life By You cost Paradox around 208 million krona, or $19.2 million. It was the primary contributor to a 90% decrease in the company's operating profit for the second quarter of 2024, versus the same quarter in 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m acutely aware someone on RPS, usually me, ends up dealsposting about the Samsung Pro Plus every time there’s a big hardware sale going on. As there currently is, with Amazon’s Prime Big Deal Days having returned to town. But don’t let my complete lack of original thinking overshadow two simple facts: one, this is still the best microSD card for the Steam Deck, and two, the 512GB model very nearly half price on both sides of the Atlantic. That’s £38 (down from £74) in the UK, and $40 (down from $76) in the US.

If Thaddius Cornflakes had recommended struggling families play Combo Critters instead of eating Cookie Crisp for dinner, I imagine the backlash would have been far more reserved. Cookie Crisp tastes like like someone poured Splenda on a packing peanut fished out from a puddle. Combo Critters, though? Pretty tasty, and also free from Itch here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No game protagonist is more willing to stick his hand down a toilet than James Sunderland. Why is he doing this? You would have to ask him or the psychiatrist he badly requires. And it's unlikely he'd explain himself. This isn't the type of story in which the protagonist has difficulty accepting the existence of horrors, nor struggles with the surreality of what he needs to do to get through a locked door. In the opening minutes, James finds a well with a glowing red square floating inside, stares into it (it saves your game), then makes a calm remark about the odd sensation he feels, and moves on. The human corpses that pepper the town of Silent Hill are noticeably that of James himself, his head bludgeoned and bloodied beyond recognition but his jacket and boots unmistakable. He makes no remark on this. It's probably nothing.

They're now calling themselves Halo Studios, a piece of rhetorical doubling-down that reminds me of those dril tweets about "James Bond, author of James Bond". They've also abandoned the proprietary Slipspace game engine used by Halo Infinite in favour of Epic's Unreal Engine 5, which will be the basis for "multiple new games". To celebrate the occasion, Halo Studios have released some footage of Project Foundry, an expansive Unreal Engine 5 prototype and spawning vat for actual Halo games, which is billed by the Xbox Newswire as a kind of ur-Halo - "a true reflection of what would be required for a new Halo game using Unreal, and a training tool for how to get there".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graham asked me if I'd discovered what the metaphor in Metaphor: ReFantazio might be, and I replied, "I don't know haha", or something along those lines. Having given it more thought, I think there are two metaphors: 1) It plays quite like Persona. 2) Its story is like a commentary on our society… or something to that effect.
Metaphors aside, though, the game is a gigantic fantasy RPG that's technically better than Persona 5 in a lot of ways. Structurally, it feels less repetitive. It has more animated cutscenes that elevate those key story moments. You can brush aside weaker enemies in real-time combat, rather than face them in tiresome turn-based tangoes. And overall, I think it's the best game Persona or Persona-like Atlus have put out - it really is brilliant. But there's a part of me that feels like it's missing something that'll leave it less ingrained in the memory than Persona 5 once its final chapter has closed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s a genre of lesser fun that only makes itself known to me once I’ve completely given up on enjoying a game in any traditional sense, lurking under the surface like a silly icon on a losing scratchcard. I’ll call it ‘system tourism’ in lieu of something better. It’s not like the actually fulfilling virtual tourism you might do in something like Yakuza’s Kamurocho, where you’re scarfing down deep fried whiskeys, entranced by the lights. It’s more like doing a Google street view tour of Venice’s canals to see if you can spot someone taking a leak off the side of a gondola - hunting for anarchic anomalies because, honestly, the sights just aren’t grabbing you.
At the risk of sounding like some sort of horrible joy-mathematician: My experience with open world zombie survival game Dread Dawn involved precisely two and half discrete instances of fun, plus some additional appreciation for a few genuinely good ambient bits I’ll get into shortly. With a significant overhaul of basically every player interaction Dread Dawn offers - from the abysmally tedious looting to the rusty combat -  it might some day be worth your time. It harbours some incredible ambition, though it’s surrounded by murk and detritus, like a dictatorial rat in a toilet bowl. Mostly, though, I can only give you advance warning to avoid it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My default movement mode in horror games that actually scare me is: meandering. I seek to approach without approaching, scooting back and forth across the path like a stray hamster, worrying at the corners and avoiding clear perspectives of the route ahead, while keeping the route behind me in my peripheral vision. I have been trained to do this especially by Amnesia, where tilting your gaze too decisively at anything nasty drives your character nuts.
Lurks Within Walls has no time for my hamstery antics. Developed by Here Be Monsters, it's a grid- and turn-based first-person dungeon crawler - a long-lost cousin of Etrian Odyssey that has wound up in an asylum jammed with internet cryptids, reminiscent in cinematic texture of F.E.A.R. In keeping with other grid-based dungeon crawlers, it only lets you turn the view by 90 degree angles and travel in straight lines. Going by the demo, it's a promising restraint for a horror game, though they really do need to expand on the combat, which is currently a slight waste of some terrific creature art.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Playing Phoenix Springs feels like David Lynch spliced together the ripped pages of a pulpy sci-fi comic with the storyboards of a broody noir. Its visuals are stark and foreboding, its dialogue delivered in riddles, and its haunting choral music sounds like it's been recorded in a wind tunnel. It’s a point-and-click that calls back to early 90’s Lucas Arts adventure games, and while it shares the same frustrations, the presentation makes it feel entirely contemporary. What begins as a standard detective game - chatting to strangers, rummaging through junk, finding addresses found on the net - soon spirals into something else entirely. I’ve finished it twice and I’m still not sure I totally understand what it all means.

Now, it's time to start talking about brighter, metaversal tomorrows and hopefully, not do the whole thing all over again. Epic have detailed early plans for Unreal Engine 6, which Sweeney says will combine Unreal Engine with Fortnite's easy-to-use Unreal Editor to create a gigantic, "interoperable" metaverse platform that lets developers sell stuff that can seamlessly be transferred to other games, whether they run on Unreal Engine or not. Stealth blockchain post? Genuinely, I can neither confirm nor deny.

Last week we had a critical mass of people being off sick, away on trips, away on holiday, or locked in the cellar reviewing very long video games. As such, the flow of news to the dark god of video games journalism was sluggish. Thankfully, the Maw seems to have let us off lightly. It could have risen kraken-like from the abyss and swallowed the planet. Instead, it has merely summoned an extra moon. Quickly now, let's run through the week's PC game releases of note and top the Maw up before that bonus satellite does anything unconventional, like growing teeth.

It's a burden that only benefits rightsholders, but the ISPs are expected to cover their own costs. That contribution was insulted this week by a legal amendment that threatens ISPs with prison for failing to report piracy to the authorities. Google describes it as a requirement to flood the judiciary to avoid prison.  ISPs speak of betrayal; it doesn't get any worse than that.

Anyway, after reviewing Grunn last week it’s thankfully far more interesting and creative than poor old Baz, who’s honestly just a bit shy and actually really nice when you get past the facade. Grunn just released today, and my high level tempter is that it’s a little bit like Outer Wilds, just with all the touching wonder replaced by spooky whimsy. Here’s a trailer:

I’ve seen, read, heard, intuited and telepathically detected a lot of complaints about Outlaws stealth, ranging from “it doesn’t look realistic when she punches out stormtroopers through their blaster-resistant hats” to “please remove the hide-and-seek entirely, I wishly merely to pew-pew”. Seems likely that the patch won’t lay all these grievances to rest, to say nothing of the other problems people have with Outlaws. But I’m always interested in how developers Find The Fun in stealth mechanics, given that they are very easily unfun.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In August, Telegram founder Pavel Durov was arrested in France and later charged with complicity in crimes allegedly carried out on Telegram. The platform's failure to cooperate with French authorities appears to have been a significant aggravating factor. The multi-billionaire was eventually released on bail, offering assurances that Telegram would change for the better. Interestingly, reports from France suggest that broadcasters of live sports are already seeing improvements on the piracy front.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Turn-based" games are, as we know, all derived from Turn, the strategy game about a dog digging for coins released for the BBC Micro in 1987. Prior to this, all actions in games simply took place simultaenously, as fast as the player or players could make them. 

Fast forward to today and many games are now "turn-based", from Tactics Ogre Reborn to Age Of Wonders 4 to chess. In celebration of their orderliness, Steam is currently running a turn-based RPG fest featuring discounts and demos for "turn-based games where you grow stronger with every battle".

It’s a pretty wide-spanning array of improvements, adding support for ultrawide monitor resolutions up to 32:9, the high-quality H.265 (HEVC) video codec – on Windows only for now, apologies to the Steam Deck – and the option to "record a specified game indefinitely with no specified time limit."

Neglect to do so, and you'll pop your clogs. It's the kind of mechanical tomfoolery you'd associate with Peter Molydeux, but in this case, it's all the fine work of Stephen's Sausage Roll developer increpare and Quadrant developer undef. The developers have somehow gotten 50 levels out of this meme-ish premise, and it looks like quite an elaborate hop-and-bopper with some less-cheerful political overtones. Here's the trailer.

Knowing Brendy, he'll be sauntering down Neely Street like a gentleman dandy from 1920s Oxford, throwing out his cuffs and elbows and winking merrily at all the shambling depression metaphors who are trying to chew his legs off. While we await his verdict, here's another excerpt from a chat with Bloober earlier this summer, in which I pop the extremely imaginative question of what they'll do after remaking Silent Hill 2. The answer, in brief, is more games with a manual third-person view that rely on ambience, suspense and the thrill of the unknown, rather than monsters going "boo!"

That’s mainly down the multiplayer Operations mode. It isn’t quite as deep as Darktide, but it feels like much less work, and I’m starting to realise just how phenomenal the little details in the animation and sound are. Saber seem to agree they’ve got a winner on their hands, too. As per yesterday’s community update, they’re not wasting any time spilling the details on the game’s next co-op mission.

Most of the audience for that screening rocked up fully equipped with suspenders, feather boas, extravagant lipstick, and a cherished selection of deliberately unfunny heckler's lines to deploy at key moments in the movie.
Have you not seen the Rocky Horror Show? It's a wildly camp musical and B-movie homage for stage and screen, in which two homely, heteronormative Americans seek shelter in a castle run by Tim Curry's high-kicking mad scientist Dr Frank-N-Furter. I can't speak for how well it has aged, but it was a hit work of sexual counterculture in the 1970s, and is absolutely Curry's finest hour outside of Command And Conquer.

Despite the fantasy MMORPG having worked fine on the Deck in previous betas, a celebrating Amazon employee must have drunkenly nudged the 'Break game on Linux' lever at the office launch party, as reports began trickling in of handheld players being kicked from servers. The cause: Easy Anti-Cheat, Throne and Liberty’s hacker thwarter of choice, declaring an error.
Fortunately, as of right now (October 2nd), all seems well again – I’ve got Throne and Liberty running on a Steam Deck OLED as I type this, and can mosey around next to fellow online players without issues. A lot of them are turning into wolves. Most of them, in fact. Maybe too many.

As spotted by PC Gamer, WizKids have recently opened pre-orders for a set of greasy pre-painted fetishes based on Larian’s RPG. WizKids, of course, being the maker of supermarket-discount-aisle-ass toys but, ah, they’ve got a base on them so we can pretend they’re proper models and charge you accordingly. Moaning about toys now, are we Nic? Is this what the profession has been reduced to? And to that I say: videogames are toys anyway, they’re just slightly better at hiding it. Also, several of them are worth owning.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Smite 2 developers Hi-Rez Studios have laid off an unspecified number of workers, as part of what they call a "internal reorganization and reprioritization". The layoffs would ultimately benefit Smite 2, claimed the company's boss, who added that the cuts "disproportionally affect" those working on cosmetic skins and game "system features", as well as people in marketing and publishing roles.

The court's decision suggests that IP addresses may not be considered "links", potentially limiting the scope of these subpoenas. This interpretation could impact the music and film industries' efforts to identify and take action against infringers and operators of piracy services.

It's slated to launch in 2026. Will the new Lords Of The Fallen also be called Lords Of The Fallen? Will it build on the exciting innovations of Lords Of The Fallen, or will it seek to recapture the nostalgic charms of Lords Of The Fallen? Perhaps in ten years time we'll do a list feature, "Lords Of The Fallen Games Ranked", with just one entry. I'm pretty sure that in 10 years time, generative AI plagiarism will have rendered everything interchangeable anyway.

However, the blueprints for 3D-printing it are freely available on GitHub, which is enough to convince me that someone needs to develop some kind of chaotic party game that uses the Möbius strip-shaped Gboard (good spot, Tom’s Hardware) as a controller.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I do not wish to dwell overly long on the incredible stop motion sheep in the trailer for folk horror game Daemonologie, because it’s got so much else going for it - from the gorgeously haunting vocal and string melodies to the extremely dark character interactions that offer your witch finder the choice between 'talk' and 'torture'. And yet, living in Wales for the last decade must have rubbed off. The sweet sheep, they sing to me. The relative rarity of stop motion and other practical effects in horror media is surely one of the greater tragedies of our age, although not too surprising given the incredible amount of work it takes. Flock toward the trailer below, and I’ll see you on the other side of the pasture, hopefully as deeply altered by the experience as I was.

At its heart are a couple of interesting ideas undermined by its own determination to put the wrong thing on centre stage. Make a rich and elaborate resource management game with an unorthodox research system, but then spend so much time on a simultaneous turn system and detailed animations that you're left with a cumbersome interface and lifeless AI, and you too might wind up making Ara.
There's an almost great game here, but it's all neglected and bruised from being shoved into the packaging of a lacklustre 4X.

And being one of RPS' foremost Yakuza sickos, I can say that I remain cautious about it, with perhaps a hint of optimism. It doesn't look like it's going for goofy, but instead opting for largely gritty and serious and almost entirely unrelated to the Yakuza games. Still, though, I do know how the show ends. It's really obvious, actually, when you think about it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wild-eyed stickman brawler Judero appears to have kicked off a small wave of pagan-themed games - or rather, it has recalibrated my brain to be more aware of pagan-themed games. The latest to catch my fancy is party-based RPG Banquet For Fools, out in Early Access today with a demo. Created by two-person Hannah and Joseph Games, it casts you as one of the Vollings - a race of gaunt elven humanoids, hailing from the same school of manky action-figure as Judero, who have been shunned by their gods and have accordingly turned to paganism. 


Specifically, you're a lord who has set up a spice farm on a "cursed" island, the former home of a long-dead civilization. This certainly sounds like a foolish thing to do, and it's no huge surprise that everybody on your farm has gone missing. So off you trot with a team of four custom-generated companions to solve the mystery, and also make up gnarly spells by daubing your blood on trees.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Something feels off. I’ve brought an utterly improbable Champions League title to Aston Villa, built an enviable Ultimate Team and developed a formation that keeps at least outright humiliation at bay in online matches… And yet, my heart isn’t bursting with the joy of joga bonito. This must be how Guardiola feels, popping onto the pitch to celebrate his annual Prem title with the latest batch of ruthlessly efficient, lab-grown wonderkids and pushing down the feeling that this one doesn’t feel quite as special as the first.
That is to say, EA Sports FC25 is a bit like FC24. Which was quite a lot like FIFAs 21-23, which had a lot in common with the FIFAs our ancient ancestors used to play by the fireside in their primitive tribal dwellings. There are noticeable additions - particularly new tactics controls and a 5v5 Rush mode - and I’m glad they’re here. But as much as they contribute towards a continuously compelling suite of foot-to-ball, they can’t quite dislodge the nagging feeling that this shouldn’t be an annual, full-price release anymore.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When the trailer for steampunk RPG New Arc Line released in April, I was immediately taken in by its premise. To my shame, I’ve never gotten around to the social tensions and magic-meets-technology world of Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura. A newer, shinier journey to a similar setting sounded like just the ticket. After spending a few hours with the preview build, I do have at least one bit of very positive news to share: I’m definitely going to play Arcanum now, because despite some fetching environments and potentially interesting social systems, New Arc Line just isn’t doing it for me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While I’m all for building dread through a lingering introduction, it’s always a treat to play a horror game that wastes no time tearing the moorings of familiarity right out from underneath you, as is the case with 13th Street Studios’ Becrowned. In fact, the game’s demo managed to make me go “oooh” then “ah!” in three different ways before I’d even exited the starting elevator. It also made me go “ugh” once, because I opted against tank controls, despite the suggestion to use them with mouse and keyboard. I come to you as disembodied voice, trapped between the worlds of video game inputs, with a dire plea: don’t do that. Just use tank controls. I’d restart but I’m already in too deep.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been over a decade since Blizzard, developers of StarCraft and WarCraft, released a new real-time strategy game, but not for want of enthusiasm from certain Blizzard developers. According to a report, former StarCraft 2 production director Tim Morten and unnamed accomplices pitched several RTS projects to higher-ups at Activision-Blizzard, before Morten jumped ship to co-found Stormgate creators Frost Giant in 2020. These pitches included WarCraft 4, as you'd expect, and also a Call Of Duty RTS, as you'd probably also expect, though seemingly no new StarCraft.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite his cinephile tendencies, one thing you can’t accuse Kojima of is being precious about how people experience his work. Would Scorsese release eight minutes of a film chopped up into two minute chunks on Xitter, to be experienced fractured and contextless to anyone who didn’t tune into the Tokyo Game Show? Would Scorsese have the chutzpah to call a character Head Viceman or Tempted Christman? I doubt it. Irishman doesn’t count. It’s Dollman’s time now anyway. Let’s have a look at the new Death Stranding 2 scenes then. Watch them on your phone for added kino.

Bread! There is nothing so horrible, and nothing so seductive. I'd like to cut back on the stuff to minimise middle-aged corpulence, but there's a place down the road that sells this amazing, tearable sourdough, and I can't get enough of it. Fortunately/unfortunately, there don't seem to be any bread-themed PC games out this week. Here's our round-up.

The Court of Thessaloniki heard that the local man sold subscriptions to thousands of customers, generating millions of euros. After the court sent him to prison for eight years, attention now turns to a seized customer database. The authorities are said to be preparing cases against customers, some of whom have already been arrested.

I’m currently reading Brendan Keogh’s The Videogame Industry Does Not Exist. It’s interesting enough that I’m only mildly pissed off about the added academic book tax. Paying the academic price is funny if you say it like paying the iron price. Although, again, not quite funny enough to soothe my awful uni flashbacks of books that cost a week’s worth of groceries each. This week, it’s writer on Tomb Raider, Mirror's Edge, BioShock Infinite plus loads more, and host of BBC Radio’s Mythical Creatures - Rhianna Pratchett! Cheers Rhianna!
