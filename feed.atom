How to navigate the maze in Dress to Impress: Lana Lore Chapter 3 (DTI)


Chapter 3's maze features four types of traps across the map. You'll initially encounter rising or dropping spikes from the ground, damaging half of your heart health. Some scythes will also drop down, along with various spiky logs. It's best to jump whenever you encounter these traps to keep your health intact.

The series doesn’t shy away from incorporating real-world paranormal folklore, cleverly transforming well-known legends into vivid, larger-than-life antagonists. For instance, the Serpo Aliens that abducted Momo Ayase. 


But like other entities featured in the anime, these aliens aren’t merely the product of creative fiction. They are inspired by a real-world conspiracy theory.

All Poached Basil Butter Sturgeon Disney Dreamlight Valley ingredients


To make this four-star dish, you'll require the following ingredients:



White Sturgeon


Butter


Basil


Lemon

White Sturgeon can be found within the waters of the Frosted Heights. Get your fishing rod and get the valuable fish for your dish. They're from orange ripples in the water; I found them very quickly in my experience. Butter is an easy ingredient to find as it's sold in Chez Remy after finishing the Ratatouille realm's missions in the Castle. 


Basil, which can also be used for cooking Creamy Soup, is picked up from the ground in Peaceful Meadow. Look for its green leaves and you should find the herb fairly easily. Lastly Lemons can be grabbed from trees within the Forest of Valor and Glade of Trust.  All of these ingredients are pretty easy to get, so you should be able to gather them and cook them at any stove around your house or Chez Remy easily. You'll now have the fancy four-star dish to give, eat, or sell in Disney Dreamlight Valley.


How much is this dish worth?


You can sell the Poached Basil Butter Sturgeon for 2,284 Star Coins at Goofy's Stall and you can eat the meal for 4,961 Energy. If you sell it, it will account towards your Dreamlight tasks and goals.

Anyway, now’s a good time to get into some indie Game Boy Color horror, like what’s packed into the Metamorphosis Collection. You can even get a physical cartridge if you’re into that sort of thing (I am).


The three games included are Opossum Country, Decline, and Specimen 134, all by Ben Jelter. Two of these games, Opossum Country and Decline are available already on itch.io, so you can play them right now for free. They were created for game jams. Specimen 134, on the other hand, is a completely new game. It’s also supposedly a lot longer than the other two. However, there is a demo of it that you can try.

This includes the roughly $630,000 (90,000,000 yen) he spent to make it a reality.


Sakurai, known for creating franchises like Super Smash Bros. and Kirby, also explained the rather intense process he set for himself. He starts the video by asking if we think he looks older than he does in his other videos. It seems like a silly thing to ask, partially because the man hasn't aged since 2001.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Call of Duty Black Ops 6 is expected to go live soon, and we might also have some idea about when Season 1 will begin.


Like all the recent COD titles, the upcoming shooter's live content will be divided into seasons. The start of the first season also marks the integration of Warzone into the new title, so the date is of prime importance. So far, Activision has remained tight-lipped about when the new season will go live. Thankfully, an ongoing promotion by Little Caesars has hinted at when we could enjoy the first seasonal content.


Call of Duty Black Ops Season 1 expected release date


The only confirmed date we have so far is related to the official launch of the game, which is on October 25. Currently, Little Caesars is having a cross-brand promotion with Activision ahead of Black Ops 6's launch, and you can win some really interesting rewards.


As per the information tweeted by CharlieIntel, Activision is planning to launch Season 1 on November 14. If the final date remains unchanged, it will take three weeks for the game to get its first pieces of seasonal content. Till that happens, the Warzone content integration won't take place either, which means that you'll have to be satisfied with Zombies, Campaign, and Multiplayer modes.




Once Season 1 goes live, you'll be able to access the Battle Pass as well. It will be exciting to find out the exact content which will be part of the pass. As usual, there will be more rewards on the Premium version, which can be unlocked with tokens/Vault Edition upgrade.


Do note that Activision could change the release date of Season 1, so take the information with a grain of salt. For now, make sure to pre-load the system files on your preferred platform ahead of the global launch on October 25.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Secret of the Snooze.
It has been a little over a year since Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem arrived in cinemas, and a lot has changed for the heroes in a half-shell. Shredder's Revenge has welcomed not one, but two DLC packs, THQ Nordic has announced a Last Ronin adaptation and, in 2024 alone, the Switch has already landed a pair of new TMNT releases. In short, when Outright Games and developer A Heartful of Games announced they were working on a tie-in to the 2023 movie, our reaction was something along the lines of, "Yeah, that sounds about right."
One year on, and we are quite frankly impressed at how ambitious that tie-in turned out to be. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed packs an entire follow-up story into its 15-hour runtime with wonderful voice acting and far more Persona (yes!) influence than we ever would have expected. It's very much not without its flaws — the combat is repetitive, the plot feels bloated, and the performance on Switch regularly moves at a snail's (or should that be turtle's?) pace — but it does aim for something slightly different, and that deserves praise.

Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is one of the best games of 2024, and with the recently released DLC, we thought it would just keep getting even better. Sadly, a new report suggests that the team behind the excellent Metroidvania has been disbanded by Ubisoft, and a sequel was refused.
According to French gaming journalist Gautoz on the Origami YouTube channel (and summarised by ResetEra User Arubedo), Ubisoft had determined the game's future a few weeks after the game's January 2024 launch. The company made it clear to the team at Ubisoft Montpellier that after all the cosmetics and DLC were out, "it would be the end."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Toji, or Tuji if you prefer the copyright-safe name, just got added to Anime Vanguards with Update 1, and you're surely wondering how to get him and his evolution. Well, it can be done relatively quickly, depending on whether you already have a JJK unit you're willing to sacrifice. For more details, scroll down.


How to Get Toji in Anime Vanguards



Screenshot by Destructoid



To get Toji in Anime Vanguards, you'll first have to clear Act 6 of the Shibuya Station Story stage, which drops a special item called the Cursed Worm. After that, you'll have to complete three challanges in order:



Challenge 1:

Kill Dogon — Shibuya Station Story stage Act 1, Shibuya Station Infinite


Kill Transfigured Mahato — Shibuya Station Story stage Act 6, Shibuya Station Infinite


Kill Sukono — Shibuya Aftermath Legend stage Act 2, Shibuya Station Infinite


Kill Jag-o — Shibuya Aftermath Legend stage Act 1




Challenge 2:

Sacrifice an evolved update unit — Click on Cursed Worm in inventory and then Sacrifice.




Challenge 3:

Kill Reanimated Tuji in Shibuya Station Story stage Act 2





After you finish the Act 2 stage, you'll gain Tuji as a reward. There is a small chance that it will be shiny, which gives it a slightly cooler cosmetic. There was a way to get multiple Tujis, but it has been patched.


How to Evolve Toji in Anime Vanguards

Toji is one of the easiest units to evolve in AV, as you won't have to farm random evo materials but instead just get 5,000 kills with him. You can do this quickly by spamming Paragon stages with Thrice mods. After that, visit the Evolution NPC and complete the evolution.


That does it for our guide on how to get and evolve Toji (Tuji) in Anime Vanguards. For more AV content, including our Update 1 tier list, visit the Anime Vanguards section here on Destructoid.

        <updated>2024-10-22T16:44:24.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If recent rumors are to be believed, the Trailblazers promo will go live very soon in EA FC 25 and could feature some amazing cards.


The Trailblazers promo is going to be a returning campaign, as it was extremely well received last year. In EA FC 24, it featured special cards for footballers who excelled in the early season performances for their respective clubs. So far, we have no official information regarding the release date or the cards that will be present in it. That said, here are all the available rumors.


EA FC 25 Trailblazers promo expected release date


Last year, the Trailblazers promo was released right after the RTTK promo. This year, the RTTK campaign was succeeded by the Total Rush cards. Rumors suggest that the Trailblazers promo will be released once the Total Rush campaign is over. If EA Sports follows the expected calendar, the Trailblazers promo will go live on Friday, October 25.


There's also a possibility that the Trailblazers promo could be two weeks long like RTTK and Total Rush. Whether that happens or not remains to be seen, but for the time being, I am expecting the upcoming promo to have two separate releases. If that happens, the second team will be expected to release on November 1.


EA Sports usually confirms the release date of a promo 24-48 hours before it goes live in Ultimate Team.


EA FC 25 Trailblazers player leaks


As of this writing, no fresh player leaks related to the Traiblazers promo have occurred yet. However, we will update the names once there are leaks close to the promo's release.


Here are a few footballers I expect to see in the upcoming promo (these are not leaks, but my predictions).



Viktor Gyokeres


Caroline Hansen


Cole Palmer


Lamine Yamal


Bradley Barcola



It will be interesting to learn all the special cards that could be included in the upcoming promo.

While those items are expensive, you won't need an arm and a leg to buy them - a finger will do. To be more precise, you need  Sukuna's fingers as a currency. Here's how to get Cursed Fingers in Anime Vanguards.


How to Get Cursed Fingers in Anime Vanguards  (UPDATE 1)

You can earn Cursed Fingers by playing Shibuya Station Infinite mode. Don't be confused if you don't see fingers as a reward. You'll get them, but for some reason, developers thought it best to hide this reward from the list. Of course, to play the Shibuya Station Infinite map, you must first unlock it. Be prepared; this is one of the harder levels, as Mohato and his clones come from multiple directions.

After many months of theories and speculation, it seems we have a concrete answer. Twitter/X user Nintendeal recently discovered copyright text for Mario & Luigi: Brothership that seems to confirm that Acquire is developing the game. This is the studio behind the Tenchu series and the Octopath Traveler series (which it developed alongside Square Enix). Although, it is important to point out that Nintendo hasn't officially confirmed this information yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been a long time coming, but Dotemu has confirmed that Metal Slug Tactics will launch on November 5, 2024 on PC, Switch, PS4/5, and Xbox Series X|S.


Not only that, they’ve also revealed that three Ikari Warriors characters are being added to the mix, including Clark Still, Ralph Jones, and Leona Heidern. The likelihood that any of them will land on my team is essentially nil unless I’m forced to for some reason. It’s not that I don’t like Ikari Warriors. It’s that I love Metal Slug. Though, all three characters have appeared in Metal Slug games. If you’re wondering about Leona, she was DLC for Metal Slug XX.




It’s been a bit of a protracted wait for Metal Slug Tactics. It was first announced at the 2021 Summer Games Fest. Development was quiet for a long time as the developer was working on multiple projects. Back in June, a demo of it was released, and I enjoyed it. It took a while, but it eventually clicked with me. The Metal Slug dressing feels more cosmetic, as the tactical gameplay is a pretty far cry from the typical run-and-gun format. However, as a simple turn-based tactical strategy game, I think it works pretty well.


It does have a strong roguelite feel to it. You make runs through regions to take on bosses, and gain permanent upgrades. The good news is that this makes the game more skill-based, and you can’t just level up your units. The bad news is that it has roguelite elements. I don’t personally hate that progression style, but it does give me a bit of pause.


Truthfully, I’d play just about anything with Fio in it, so I’m already on board, though this month has been very busy, and the beginning of next month is looking as though it will be the same. I’ll probably get to it eventually, even if it’s not right away.


Metal Slug Tactics launches on November 5, 2024. It will be released on PC, Switch, PS4, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. There will be a physical edition coming later on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One Piece's official accounts recently announced the anime's six-month hiatus. However, fans of the series will not be left unattended. A special episode called One Piece Fan Letter and One Piece Log: Fish-Man Island Saga will take the anime's time slot. The former has already been released, while the latter is set to air the week after.


Unfortunately, official One Piece channels just announced that the remaster will be postponed to make way for Major League Baseball (MLB) World Series' live broadcast. One Piece Log: Fish-Man Island Saga was originally set to release on October 27. The first episode's release date has now changed to November 3.




The remaster will revamp the Straw Hat Pirates' adventure on the kingdom under the sea. It will not only improve upon the shading, animation, and special effects, but also compress the original 58 episodes into 21 episodes. Doing so will likely improve the anime's pacing, which One Piece is notoriously known for. Furthermore, the saga will feature a Dolby Atmos soundtrack, offering a contemporary retelling of the Straw Hats’ underwater journey.


A complete recap of the Fish-Man Island Arc's most notable moments can be found here. But to put it briefly, the Fish-Man Island Arc will see the Straw Hat Pirates return after their two-year training. Stronger and more skilled than ever, the crew is finally ready to take on the New World. However, their first challenge lies beneath the ocean in the mysterious and politically fraught Fish-Man Island.


One Piece Log: Fish-Man Island Saga will be available for streaming via Crunchyroll. Other seasons of One Piece can also be streamed through Crunchyroll and Netflix. However, availability may vary depending on region.

Until now, that is. If your WW2 artillery needs are not being met by Skyrim, perhaps this mod will scratch that battle scar. As reported by DSO Gaming, Nexus Mods user MixedMartialArtist brings "World of Tanks" to The Elder Scrolls 5.

It's set in the 1980s, a premise I now automatically find horrible because I was born in the 1980s and that was, like, a million years ago. You're a kid who's playing a legendary 8-bit game that's said to be possessed by evil spirits. The experience sees you alternating between the surprisingly labyrinthine space of the game, and the increasingly threatening environment of your bedroom, where terrible toys abound. Did you have one of those phones on wheels with eyes as a kid? Whoever invented that deserves a spell in Arkham Asylum.

Original story: The Caves Of Qud developer has posted a cryptic riddle that sounds a bit like a release date in disguise. A post on the game's Steam page yesterday reads: "{n} purple wardens beseech the Chair, What is death, if one rose is fair? How long from beetle moon to beetle moon?" That means absolutely nothing to me. But at least one fan in the comments knows their lore enough to have translated it, resulting in a specific date later this year. If their solution is correct, this could be a characteristically cryptic way for developer Freehold Games to announce the date for the roguelike's 1.0 release. So, let's double check those numbers.

Developed by FreakZone Games, the fittingly titled The Rocky Horror Show Video Game is now available to download for £7.99 / $9.99 (there's even a 10% discount on it at the moment), promising retro platforming thrills with a simple pixel art style.

Appearing on an episode of 'Hot Ones' Versus with Mackenzie Davis, McAvoy cited Square's legendary 1993/94 RPG Super Nintendo release Secret of Mana as his favourite game of all time. He labelled it a "cool" but "niche" game and unfortunately his co-star wasn't able to guess what it was - instead name-dropping titles like Wolfenstein 3D, Donkey Kong Country, Mortal Kombat and Zelda.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nik from the best.
It’s now been over a decade since the last new Donkey Kong Country game released (yes, you’re that old), and while the world continues to wait for Nintendo to remember that its beloved ape used to star in a really good platforming series of his own, other developers have stepped up to try to fill the void. Indie releases such as Kaze and the Wild Masks, Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair, and Marsupilami: Hoobadventure have all done an exceptional job of emulating the things that made DK’s old side-scrolling romps so enjoyable and now another contender has stepped up to the plate.
Nikoderiko: The Magical World, the inaugural release of Cyprus-based VEA Games, not only does a great job of recreating DK’s best adventures with its own twist, but it takes things a step further by also calling back to the gameplay style of some other classic platformer mascots. And while, yes, one could make the argument that Nikoderiko is a little too comfortable riding the coattails of the classics without adding many of its own ideas, it does such a good job of capturing what made those games great that it hardly matters. Nikoderiko doesn’t eclipse the projects that served as its clear inspirations, but it provides an enjoyable and challenging platforming adventure that we’d suggest to any fans of the genre.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Knowledge acquired.
One of the biggest mysteries surrounding the reveal of Mario & Luigi: Brothership for the Switch was which team(s) was actually handling the development now that AlphaDream is no longer around.
Well, as we approach the game's release on 7th November 2024, it looks like we now have a reasonably sound idea of who the development team is (at least, without firm confirmation from Nintendo itself). As posted by Nintendeal on social media, Brothership is seemingly the result of a collaboration between Nintendo and Acquire.

Sonic X Shadow Generations will be entering early access tomorrow for seemingly everything but Switch if you opt for the Digital Deluxe version of the game. Naturally, then, a whole bunch of reviews are starting to crop up online.
By the looks of things, it seems that the vast majority of write-ups are for the PS5 version, and you might also be wondering where our own review is. Well, we've not received a code yet unfortunately, and it looks like we won't be getting one until the game's full release on 25th October 2024.

Valve designers Lawrence Yang and Yazan Aldehayyat have shared a little of the company's thinking regarding "generational leaps" in hardware, commenting that they don't want to release a Steam Deck sequel that is "only incrementally better", and in particular, that they don't want to release a new Steam Deck that is drastically more powerful at the expense of battery life.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in the protean stink of 2013, the beast we call Factorio sprouted in lowercase early access form and began its meticulous, ravenous conquest of the emerging factory sim genre. Some say that Factorio gave that genre life, though I'd point at Dwarf Fortress as one among many notable forebears. Today, the terrain of factory simming is hotly contested by rival piles of conveyor belt spaghetti. I'm not just talking about Satisfactory or Shapez - they're even making philosophical factory sims these days. They have cosy factory sims now.
Accordingly, the immense, smoke-rimmed cyborg eye of Factorio has turned from the exhausted soil to the relatively untapped heavens. Somewhere up there, there is unspoilt territory. Somewhere, there is land that has never known the roar of a smelter - and in Factorio's behemothic Space Age DLC, out today, you will find it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The spotlight fantastic.
When Blumhouse Productions announced its venture into the video game industry with Blumhouse Games, it would have been all too easy for the company to lean on some of its most recognisable IPs for its first release. Franchises such as Insidious, The Purge, Sinister, and Paranormal Activity certainly have strong potential within the video game realm, but Blumhouse has instead chosen to take a chance on two-person development team Cozy Game Pals and their debut title, Fear the Spotlight.
And boy, was it the right decision! With its low-fi, PS1-style visuals, tactile puzzles, and a sharp focus on atmosphere and dread, Fear the Spotlight is a wonderful venture into the unknown that will keep you enthralled throughout its five-to-six-hour runtime. Very minor performance hiccups aside, if you’re after something spooky yet approachable to complement your Halloween celebrations this year, Cozy Game Pals’ narrative horror is the perfect choice.

As detailed in our first hands-on, it's approaching 10 years (!) since we last hooked up with Mario and Luigi in this format, and therefore Mario & Luigi: Brothership has its work cut out in sailing this franchise into more modern waters as the plucky plumbers take on the challenge of piecing back together the land of Concordia, which has been split into separate islands by...well, that would be spoiling things.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Polish streaming service CDA has once again been accused of being a notorious piracy market by the Motion Picture Association (MPA). CDA sent a rebuttal to the US government, dismissing the claims as false and misleading. In addition, the company points out that the MPA was provided with a direct takedown tool but has never used it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[RailGods Of Hysterra is one of those games that, as it were, shovels a bunch of relatively dried-up concepts into the squirming furnaces of something appealingly ghastly. On the one hand, it's burdened by talk of "crafting", "base-building" and "survival" - all things I have enjoyed but am currently weary of, and which together make the game sound interchangeable with half of Steam. But it's elevated, on the other hand, by talk of living helltrains that eat crocodiles for breakfast. Without further ado, here's a trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a climactic scene of the original Final Fantasy VII, hero and amateur snowboarder Cloud Strife stands with his fellow adventurers as they are about to face a final, possibly fatal battle. With the steely glare of a polygonal warrior on the verge of killing god, he turns to them and says: "Let's mosey!" It's an unintentionally comical moment - an easy-going phrase, as if they're all going to the shops and not jumping into a big glowing pit at the end of the world.
It's a result of the RPG's famously rushed translation. But maybe not in the way you think. A fan translation of Final Fantasy VII has now fixed a bunch of mistakes that were present in the original, and "let's mosey" is one of them. The fix? Have Cloud say it way more often.

At CitizenCon over the weekend, CIG head promiser Chris Roberts said that he’s “confident” that Sqorty-two will release in 2026, via Ian Games. CIG also released a video of the entire first hour and fifteen of the game, which you can watch below.

In my efforts to achieve the absolute tranquility needed to spend five days shovelling PC game news stories into a ravenous otherworldly monster, I often go for an early morning walk. I tend to do this while wearing my trusty, enveloping Honcho Poncho, because the UK summer is thoroughly behind us and the very air has begun to squelch. Anyway, while walking this morning I think I actually scared somebody into crossing the road. It turns out roaming around at sunrise near Halloween looking like a ringwraith is a great way to become a figure of menace. Sorry, neighbour! I'll wear that nice top hat and opera mask from my socialite days in future. Anyway, let us FEED THE MAW.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deadlock gives me the shakes. Valve's not-so-secret third-person MOBA shooter is a fiercely competitive game of push and pull through monster-peppered city streets. You'll get into hectic scrapes with a giant blob man and come out of it sweating and swearing, and possibly alive. It is tactical, deep, instinctive, and an interesting work-in-progress. It elicits adrenaline almost as much as it forces murder economics down your piehole. This is the kind of game that puts you into a blistering, exciting (and confusing) battle for survival, then displays a graph when you lose. I need to get as far away from it as possible.

Such a failure of cable management pierces my conscience like the beat of Poe's tell-tale heart, and yet I’m forever powerless – as in, I can’t be bothered – to do anything about it. Yet even I was soothed by the Steam Next Fest demo for Plug It In, a chilled-out puzzle game about clicking chunky plugs into the right outlets.

Picture that game in your mind: the quietness of the hallways versus the crash of a thunderstorm outside, the sickly-sweet 90s décor, the fairy lights and screwed-up balls of paper, the gentle amber pressure of cloistered teenage memories. Now, imagine a faint scuttling behind the skirting boards. A rattling in the pipes. Was there a toilet in Gone Home's autumnal mansion? I can't recall, but you should probably steer clear.

Ah well, circle of life and all that. Plus, at least it’s thematic: you’ll have to make sacrifices yourself if you want to progress across its unforgiving deserts. This one’s got shades of roguelite, RPG, strategy, and turn-based tactics. Nothing too uncommon, but it’s the shades of Red Faction, Frostpunk, and Sunless Sea that have me interested.

For well over a decade, Sony argued that modification of game generated code amounted to copyright infringement. The CJEU judgment holds that there was no violation of Sony's rights, since Action Replay ran alongside Sony's game code, only modifying values in RAM while leaving object code untouched.

Previously codenamed Condor, it's called FBC: Firebreak - and I am going to immediately recommend they shorten it to Firebreak, because that caps-into-colon combo is going to wind me up when I'm writing news posts at speed. While I'm throwing my weight around, let me also instantly rebut the pedants who are even now racing to leave a comment saying that, actually, Remedy did work on Smilegate's multiplayer shooter CrossfireX. Yes, they did, but only the single player bits. 


Anyway, Firebreak! Here's the announcement trailer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Remedy have released the first proper in-game trailer for Alan Wake 2's second expansion, The Lake House. It's billed as even more of a horror experience than the base game, and takes place in a research facility run by the Lynchian ghostbuster organisation you may have encountered in Remedy's paranormal shooter Control. As such, the expansion forms a direct connection between the games, and may - read: definitely will - harbour a few clues about the story of the forthcoming Control 2.

The announcement came at the tail-end of Bohemia's 25th Anniversary Concert, alongside some disturbingly gun-less footage of a coastal promontory with rippling ocean waters against a cloudy sky - it reminds me more of The Elder Scrolls 6's announcement teaser than any tactical mili-banger. Perhaps they're secretly making an open world walking simulator? I kid, I kid. Please put the chair down.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in 2021, that dark epoch known as the Pre-Edwin Age, there was but one Ed at Rock Paper Shotgun - the venerable Ed Thorn, aka Edders. Edders had a dream, the dream of Halo Infinite getting a battle royale mode. Like Moses descending from the mount with a Needler in either hand, he bedazzled and amazed us with visions of "an enormous playground stitched together from some of Halo's most iconic maps of yore; Warthogs and Mongooses roaming the lands; players racing to the M41 SPNKR as it spawns; grappling to a rooftop and laying down covering fire; some contrived reason as to why there's a circle of poison gas closing in... but hey, rings are what Halo does best, right? It's 100% doable."
Ed Thorn has always been a journalist of great sagacity and supernatural insight, so it was of no surprise to the RPS editors of the era when rumours bubbled up a few months later that Certain Affinity had partnered with 343 Industries (nowadays Halo Studios) to make Halo battle royale a reality. These rumours have now been confirmed by Certain Affinity's former design director Mike Clopper, who says the now-cancelled mode could have been a "game changer".

Well then, perhaps you'll empathise with the enemies in Archons, a twin-stick Vampire Survivors-like where you control two characters at once, and attacks bounce between them automatically as they move about the arena. I gave the Steam Next Fest demo a quick whirl today, and after a couple of swift attempts (I died horribly fast), I realised this could become a bit of a danger to my free time, so I've put it away for now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nepos Games are the two-person studio behind Nebuchadnezzar, which Nate Crowley called "two thirds of an outstanding historical city builder". They've just informed me they're making a new building sim called County Of Fortune, out in Q4 2025. It ain't a city builder, though. In fact, it claims to have murdered the city builder in cold blood, which is unfortunate, because I was really looking forward to a round of Manor Lords later. 


"The city-builder is dead, long live the county-builder," declares the press release, brandishing the husk of SimCity over its head. OK, I'll bite - what's a county-builder then? Well, it's sort of several city-builders having an argument. In County Of Fortune, you seed and grow a number of settlements side by side, then manage their economic and social relations. In other words, it's a game that appears to simulate the phenomenon of culture clash. I'm not sure all this amounts to the wholesale death of a genre, but it's certainly intriguing. Here's the Steam page, and here's a trailer.

I foresee big success.)
Abrak is so confident, in fact, that he reckons their Bond project might end up mirroring the World Of Assassination’s trilogy format. "But what's exciting about that project is that we actually got to do an original story,” Abrak says. “So it's not a gamification of a movie. It's completely beginning and becoming a story, hopefully for a big trilogy out there in the future."
It’s a fine interview, worth a read. But I must ask: how are the queues, Abrak? How am I supposed to get excited about a new IO game if you don’t mention the queues?

In the end I had to knock them both out. As they lay unconscious, I worried they might soon wake and tell someone what I had done. This can't happen, I hate accountability. I punched their unawake bodies toward the sea in an effort to float the evidence away. But after a few punches the first man exploded into chunks of flesh. I am a murderer now. I was supposed to be a chef.
Streets Of Rogue 2 has a demo out for Steam Next Fest, and while a lot of features are locked up behind the word "UNAVAILABLE" in red font, there's still quite a lot of mischief for you to get up to.

Zatímco drážďanská továrna postavená společností ESMC, společným podnikem společností TSMC, Bosch, Infineon a NXP, se bude zaměřovat především na čipy pro německý automobilový průmysl, další továrny se prý zaměří na odvětví umělé inteligence, které předpokládá poměrně pokročilé technologie.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Archetype Entertainment and Blur Studio's space RPG Exodus was announced back in December, and was broadly notable for a couple of things: 1) Matthew McConaughey plays a character, and 2) the game's story is woven around time dilation during faster than light travel, with star-hopping adventurers prosecuting a fight against evil Celestials over hundreds, perhaps thousands of years.
Now, it is notable for three things, the third thing being a cosmic blubber-spire of gurning faces who want to eat your ship and soul. Say hello to the Mara Yama, the ickiest Celestial faction so far. Here's a trailer, in which McConaughey does that thing where he lingers on the sibilants and makes you want to lean in and vigorously mess up his hair.

Still, the pipe won’t last forever - this is videogame steel, the crumbliest steel there is. Thank god No More Room In Hell 2 doesn’t bother with the hunger or rest parts of the survival equation.

According to the eSports journalist Rod Breslau, he's been sent to the naughty step for a grand total of two weeks, which I'm sure will be a huge inconvenience and will really teach him the error of his ways. Assuming Breslau's sources are accurate, it's a great demonstration of Twitch's tolerance for streamers with big audiences, the kind of slap on the wrist you'd expect from a platform that recently reinstated Donald Trump's account after banning him in 2021 for the charge of inciting an insurrection.

In response, the STJV called on staff in France to hold a three-day strike beginning yesterday, which the union reports to be underway with the participation of more than 700 workers, via Le Monde.
"This decision is announced immediately after the failure of the profit-sharing negotiations," STJV wrote at the time. “Exactly like previous salary negociations: management’s proposals were inacceptable, the negotiations’ timetable was appalling, and management was deaf to the proposals of the various Employee representatives."

Ah yes, this is it, that sense of unpleasantly intimate sheepishness. That's the withering late-90s chatbox scorn I've been missing, in this age of glossy live service multiplayer. I hid under a stairwell in order to meditate upon my response, then laboriously typed: "No, I just suck." Right on cue, the other player tumbled into view and shredded me with an AK.
The player I met in my second match was more forgiving. "I honestly think the characters need more HP," they said, generously. My wrists need more HP, actually. My eyes and reflexes need urgent patching.

So maybe it’s just me, but there’s a sense of intense freedom and adventure to Keep Driving's Steam demo that belies its prosaic, tractor-tailing subject matter. The opening minutes are oddly silent, until Westkust’s Swirl blasts out from your radio as soon as you drive off toward your first destination - your mate’s house, to hang out and play console games. It comes on strong and sweet; a rush of wind through an open window on a warm morning.

It’s stuck with me since because the developer Tanat seemed like a rad dude, and also because there’s nothing I cherish more than taking a bad pun and just absolutely going to town on it, marrow and all. Building Relationships is about buildings forming relationships in a Love Islandy scenario, though without the reality TV framing you might find in say, Crush House. But the real gag here is the commitment to the bit. Besides that, it’s just a really charming and fun N64-style 3D platformer.
It also features the sort wonky physics that definitely wouldn’t get Ninty’s seal of quality, but work brilliantly here, especially since your character consists largely of angles but still insists on, you know, performing motions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the grim darkness of the far future, you will not have to worry about getting preyed upon by rival Space Marine chapters whilst duffing up the Tyranids, for there are no plans to add a PvPvE mode to Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2. That's according to game director Dmitry Grigorenko, who observes that enjoyable PvPvE is the "holy grail" of game design, much-sought and seldom claimed. Balancing shooters in which players fight both each other and the bots is tricky, especially in a game as prone to dousing the screen in giblets as Space Marine 2.

Picking up from where Pokémon left off two decades ago, Letalis is a bleepy-bloopy retro RPG about wandering from town to town and doing battle with dodgy local leaders to prove your worth. But you won't be doing the fighting yourself, God no. Leave that to the squad of Roman gladiators hiding in your back pocket.

The game in question is Dieseldome: Oil And Blood, and it is pretty good fun. There's a demo on Steam, for now is the time of Next Fest.

And it has an updated demo - not officially part of the latest Steam Next Fest - out right now.

The publishers had already made layoffs at Harebrained in the run-up to release, implying that preorder numbers were low; ultimately, Paradox wrote it off as a $22 million flop. At the time of the "parting of ways", Paradox chief operational officer Charlotta Nilsson washed her hands of XCOMlikes entirely, commenting that "a new project or sequel in the same genre was not in line with our portfolio plans".

Skyrim Lead Designer and Starfield Systems Designer Bruce Nesmith has spoken a little about the “interesting problem” of how open developers should be about technical issues on day one, given the expectation some players have that every game should be "flawless".
When asked by Videogamer if lists of known bugs (Nesmith throws out ‘700’ as an example for Skyrim) should be shared with fans on launch "to temper expectations," he responded:

Months!” his mate had told him. Get less shit mates, thought I, for I had already played it elsewhere, and knew that the missions took mere minutes if you put the game on easy then rushed your objectives, bonking nazis along the way. I did not rush the new Steam demo for Kalypso’s revival, Commandos: Origins, but it’s still doable inside half an hour. I had expected a little more, but what’s here has certainly given me some optimism that the full game might well be worth sinking - if not months - at least more time than it takes to wildly lunge at a few nazis en route to your objective.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Neva is the Sophomore effort from Nomada Studio, who you may remember from their beautiful, dreamy platformer Gris. Neva is not a literal sequel to Gris, but it certainly seems to be one in a spiritual sense, as it, too, is a floaty hand-illustrated platformer fond of metaphor. Neva introduces some drama, with combat and a health system (if not actual stakes because of near-instant restarts), and although neither the platforming nor combat are precise enough to be neat bedfellows, I think we should be willing to forgive most of the mess.

By elegant coincidence, that video is about the length of my longest run so far in Sektori's demo - a very busy 60 seconds or so.

They worked well together, so started looking for their next project - something full-time that could take the place of the increasing instability of freelancing.
It was a shared passion away from videogames that ended up moulding the shape that project would take. "We love tabletop RPGs," says designer and programmer Sacchetti. "So when we stumbled into Mörk Borg, and then we started to play, we looked at each other in the eyes and said, 'Why don't we make a game out of it?'"

Or maybe not. Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders is the frosty followup to the mountain biking original, Lonely Mountains: Downhill, and like its predecessor it's about going fast while barely able to see what's coming. Yet also like its predecessor, initial frustrations melted away until I was eagerly hitting the slopes in the Snow Riders demo for just one more quick go.

Cosy experiences where nothing goes wrong and you have absolutely zero things to investigate and no otherworldly mysteries to worry about. It may shock you to learn that we were recently duped by "normal" gardening sim Grunn, which was not normal at all. But don't worry, it won't happen again. Today we bring you the ordinary and not-one-bit-suspicious Trip, which sees players wandering from carriage to carriage, chatting pleasantly with passengers during a long train journey. How long? Let me look at the timetable here, let's see... "Forever," it says. Hm. Must be a misprint.

This question has plagued the games industry since Nintendo first allowed millions of unsupervised children to play god with Mii avatars and their customisable peepers. In low-stakes fishing game Webfishing, you can give your fuzzy avatar one of 33 styles of eye (I counted). This is the mark of a solid Animal Crossing-like. There's a lot of other character creation bits and bobs, of course, but you'll have to catch a bunch of bass and sell the haul to unlock every boopable nose and bleppy smile.

In Nahantu’s jungles, I linger to take shots of vines spilling from verdigris-kissed cages, of footfall-slicked stone paths and mesoamerican mosaics. Even Vessel Of Hatred’s malignancy feels like a grimly gorgeous tourist trap. Trip Advisor-recommended cyclopean polyps. TikTok viral demonic cysts. I’ve even got a leopard cub to pose with. He’s not sedated, promise. He’s just like that. I told him how much the ultimate edition costs and he’s been catatonic ever since.
I’d like to stick around, but I keep getting ushered along to the next leg of the tour. There are mobs to pop into goo like ripe spots, each fight as slick and frictionless as a pygmy hippo in a butter bath. There are a dozen different tiered resources and event types designed to make repetition feel like progress, until hell freezes over then melts again. It’s fine, Blizzard packed me some wellies. It’s all so comfortable I suspect they’d have thrown in some Xanax and a back rub if they could.

Say hello to ExeKiller, which I am filing under "not new, but news to me". I know, "ExeKiller" sounds like a computer virus, though I think the people who make viruses tend to favour less obviously nefarious names, like "Microsoft Werd". Hang on, that's what I'm writing this article with! Quickly, before I lose this PC to ransomware: ExeKiller is actually a "semi-open" world cyber-Western FPS with retro futurist visuals. It casts you as a bounty hunter plying the dunes and gas stations of a post-apocalyptic Earth, and it looks like a mix of Cyberpunk 2077 and Drive. Here's some pre-alpha footage.

I was very close to buying the recent remake, actually, until I watched the extended prank scene online and realized, oh no, they’re taking themselves seriously now. They prestige-ified it. It insisted upon itself, Louis, so I didn’t bother. I still wouldn’t say no to a sequel though, and based on a couple of (admittedly vague) hints from two of the game’s actors, one might already be in the works.

Is that sentence too long, or not long enough? That could depend on relevant information that FACT isn't reporting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thronefall is a pleasant, minimalist mashup of tower defence and strategy, in which you build up a base during the day then defend it from monstrous hordes at night. It launched in Early Access in August last year and has been wooing people with its cool colour palette ever since. Now it's hit 1.0.

Either way, this is my new favourite videogame, which gives every other game a lot to live up to.
Nevertheless, they continue to try. Here’s what we’re clicking on this weekend.

"It does something to my brain that I've never experienced before." The developer's just-announced Keep Driving seems a lot less inclined to scramble your grey matter, though it's partial to the old rose-tinted goggles. It's a droll, backward-glancing and slightly ominous 2D management RPG in which you drive to a music festival on the other side of the country. Along the way, you will pick up hitchhikers, upgrade your car, fill your boot with random junk, and participate in turn-based, non-lethal "combat" with dawdling children and obstinate tractors. Here's a trailer.

That game is Konafa Game's Starless Abyss - a roguelite tactical deckbuilder published by Descenders and Yes, Your Grace outfit No More Robots. It puts you in command of a fleet of upgradeable spaceships, who must chase away invading Eldritch aliens hex by hex... and also, hex by hex. This is both hex-based and a game in which you can cast hexes, you see. Oh, don't look at me like that. I had to distil several manifestos into an article half-an-hour ago. I need this.

The press release for this particular Disco Elysiulike has the most actual names on it of the three we've learned about this week. It is also, by some distance, the most outwardly socialist of the lot. It accompanies a website, featuring some blood-red all-caps political manifestos and a fairly exhaustive breakdown of Summer Eternal's workers cooperative structure. Amongst other things, the studio will let people who buy their games form a non-profit within Summer Eternal that gets a share of the revenue, and has a say on company direction.

A pure technical analysis would conclude that it has the fidelity of an early Nintendo Switch game at best, and yet anyone whose heart flickers with even the tiniest ember of sentiment will instantly fall in love with its lavish pause screen animations. Yes, this RPG has style for days, maybe even an entire calendar, and an upside of its more dated aspects is that it runs fine on the modest internals of the Steam Deck.

Stablemate Europa Universalis 4 has 37 DLC packs under its banner, while Cities Skylines is streets ahead with a whopping 62. Paradox Interactive have long built their core game business around putative forever-projects that trail an enormous mantle of paid expansions. It's seemingly this, as much as their institutional expertise with 4X, that justifies their commitment to grand strategy games, whose worlds and systems can be fleshed out for literal decades.

I’ll move on from his large majesty for a moment though, because it isn’t the only thing this one looks to have going for it. 
It’s a single player action RPG, to start with - a genre I’m always interested in watching evolve in ways not tied to its usual form as a good-boy-points-vomiting loot casino. It’s also based on Slavic folklore, something that’s not too uncommon but strikes a wonderful mix between blackly funny whimsy and intense dread when done right. Also, I’ll take more discordant folk music any time. Trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[That great disturbance in the Force you just felt wasn't a million voices crying out in terror. It was, in fact, me crying out in terror a million times. You see, Aspyr have just announced that they're porting Star Wars: Episode I: Jedi Power Battles to PC and Steam. I have a complicated relationship  with Jedi Power Battles, in the sense that I think I still have scars on my thumbs from when I played it all night on a busted PS1 controller. I have bled for this game. I'd close my eyes after each six-hours session and see fields of lightsabers flickering and dancing like luminous leeches, chasing me through the Dagobahnian jungles of my dreams.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I will not lie to you, gentle reader. When I first laid eyes on Secret Door's Sunderfolk, while lurking to the rear of a gaggle of journomancers at a preview event last week, I let out an ostentatious sigh. Fortunately, I still mask up to preview events, and am thus free to adopt all kinds of snotty facial expressions without being set upon by burly PRs and shoved into the minifridge for later disposal. To sum it up, Sunderfolk is a hex and turn-based 2-4 player digital boardgame with fantasy animal characters and deckbuilding elements, reminiscent of Gloomhaven. Conceived during the pandemic lockdowns as a way to "bring back game night", but without the traditional 30-minute unboxing ritual, it's played on the big screen but controlled using a dedicated smartphone app, with players stroking and swiping to move characters and play cards.

Instead of trying to stuff in ever more threads, and ever more PC-incinerating clock speeds, the Core Ultra 200S family – spearheaded by the Core Ultra 9 285K when it launches later this year – will dial back certain specs compared the 14th Gen range. Instead, the focus will be on power efficiency and lowering temperatures.

Kind Words 2 is full of touching and drifting remarks like this, written by other players and tossed into the winds for you to find. If you're allergic to vulnerability, or find cuteness or the "wholesome" games trend hard to digest, you've probably already turned your face away. But if your heart is open, even a smidge, if you carry a deep craving to peer through the cracks in the internet to discover a small realm of common humanity, then Kind Words 2 can show you a glimpse of that warm and welcoming world.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paradox Interactive delayed jail management simulator Prison Architect 2 indefinitely this August, commenting at the time that the game had notable performance issues, and that its system-led design was proving tricky to tinker with. This came a couple of months after the Crusader Kings publisher washed their hands of the sequel's original developers, Double Eleven.
Speaking to me at Paradox's Media Day last week, deputy chief executive officer Mattias Lilja offered a shade more insight on the decision, suggesting that hard-up players have "higher expectations" at present and are less trusting that developers will fix problems. Chief creative officer Henrik Fåhraeus also offered thoughts on what Paradox have learned from the disastrous launch of Cities: Skylines 2 in late 2023. Specifically, he said they need to give actual players access to the game early on, not just testers.

As spotted by PC Gamer, some garbled lines the player hears upon first picking up the game’s radio weren’t quite garbled enough in the Italian subtitles, accidentally dropping a massive plot spoiler in the first half hour. Stop reading now if you’re still playing, obviously. Here’s a video of a cat that sounds like he’s saying “bongiorno” you can watch instead.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hodně mi to připomnělo "On se bojí" nebo filmy Charlieho Kaufmana. "Jiný člověk" je ale "tlumenější" a první půlhodinu vypadá skoro jako normální film, který možná není úplně podařeně natočený. Teprve pak to začne být opravdu divné a vyjde najevo, že to od počátku všechno byl sofistikovaný plán filmařů a že tím asi chtěli něco říct. (Ilča 70 %)]]></summary>

Pojďme natočit něco pro NORMÁLNÍ děti!" A to je škoda, protože tenhle film si klade potenciálně velmi zajímavé otázky, ale většinu z nich ignoruje na úkor roztomilých zvířátek a ujetého robota.

Takhle je to 10 zajímavých minut na začátku, pak hodina nudy a pak 30 minut WTF, ve kterých už není možné nijak soucítit s nikým na plátně a bylo mi srdečně jedno, co se vlastně "doopravdy" stalo.
