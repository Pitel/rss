And it is what you will have guessed upon reading that too. And yet, I enjoyed my ten minutes binning rubbish and mopping up stains (just stains, don't worry about it). Then I played it again to see another ending, even knowing I am a big scaredy baby. Ugh. I will regret having played this next time I clean my flat at night.

The first Mario + Rabbids crossover was an interesting, surprising mix of ideas that you wouldn't presume would work together. But while Kingdom Battle laid out the groundwork, Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope feels like it's expanding the ideas and making something a bit more its own. And it's all the better for it.
It doesn't take long to get into the actual battles in Sparks of Hope. While the crew is lounging about at Peach's Castle, they're suddenly thrust into an interstellar conflict. The evil Cursa is vying for control of the galaxy. Meanwhile, Lumas are being turned Rabbid, making them into Sparks that need Mario and crew's help.
Mario, Luigi, and Peach all rejoin the starting roster, alongside their Rabbid counterparts. Down the line,…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We promise the Rabbids’ antics aren’t too annoying.
Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle came about like a fever dream in 2017. Nintendo lending Ubisoft its poster child franchise? A Rabbid dressing up as Princess Peach? Mario wielding a gun? Madness. More surprising still, it turned out to be a ridiculously good strategy game – one of the best on Switch. The sequel, Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope, has seen the general sense of surprise associated with the first replaced with one of expectation. No longer does anyone doubt whether Ubisoft can make a decent strategy game with the Mario licence, and — perhaps more astonishingly — few critics bemoan the inclusion of the chaotic little Rabbids in the Mushroom Kingdom. Five years later, the question now is whether or not Ubisoft has improved upon the formula born from gaming’s most unexpected crossover.
The answer is as complicated as Rabbids are dense. Much has changed since Beep-O and the Rabbids found themselves crossing dimensions into the Mushroom Kingdom. Despite both being strategy games with light RPG elements, Sparks of Hope plays quite differently than its predecessor, to the point where it feels almost like a different game. Gone are the labyrinthine maps interspersed with battles and block-based puzzles to solve. Instead, Sparks of Hope introduces five vibrant worlds which Rabbids have colonised, full of challenges, quirky characters, and little secrets to discover by solving simple puzzles, which are no longer restricted to the block-based variety. Classic coloured coin challenges, secret stages reminiscent of Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker, and more make for welcome additions.

So I thought this retrospective was a good opportunity to remind myself of why I still love this janky, weird ARPG about sad bloodsuckers so much, even 18 years after its release.

      <p>Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope doesn’t release until Thursday, October 20, but the review embargo lifts today. However, I’m still journeying through Mario’s latest tactical crossover, so I’m not ready to give a full verdict as of yet.

We are only a few short weeks away from the return of an icon, as Sonic Frontiers prepares for its November debut on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms — And while fans wait for The Blue Blur to return, Sega hopes to perform some important scene-setting via a narrative prologue, to be delivered in both comic-book and animation form.
https://twitter.com/sonic_hedgehog/status/1580921453058269184?s=20&t=zeTgb9VfOmVDW23JNKjcnQ
As revealed on the official Sonic the Hedgehog Twitter, Sega is preparing to drop a two-part digital comic, that will offer up a little backstory on the events that preceded Sonic finding himself isolated in a strange, eerie, and monolithic new world.  Sonic the Hedgehog: Convergence is written by frequent Sonic scribe Ian Flynn — with characterful artwork by Evan Stanley & Heather Breckel — and will no doubt provide suitable reading to get series' fans hype fires burning brightly before the game's big launch.
While no further information was offered, Sega did announce that an animated short is also in the works, which will again help lay the groundwork for the new adventure.  Sega has utilized animation frequently in its marketing of Sonic the Hedgehog titles.  And usually to very good effect, as the world of Sonic and his anthro pals always lends itself very well to the medium of animation — perhaps better than any other gaming franchise.  We'll be sure to give you a heads-up when the Sonic Frontiers comic and animated short are available.
Sonic Frontiers launches November 8 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is it just me, or did Persona 5 never feel quite at home on the PlayStation 4? Sure, it looked gorgeous on a big TV, its bright colours popping all over your living room, but it always felt bit wrong to me. I think it's all about pacing. Persona 5's blend of turn-based combat and life sim elements hardly moves at a breakneck speed. There's a lot of reading. A lot of listening to your pals chat about their hopes and fears. A lot of pressing one button to progress a line of dialogue onto the next. Shoving that on your 65" 4K TV always seemed a bit overkill.


Basically, I never got into Persona 5 when it first launched on PS4. I played about three hours of it and then binned it off in favour of something else. In 2020, during a moment of first-lockdown madness, I bought Persona 5 Royal for full price, thinking maybe my issue with the original release was that there wasn't enough of it, but surprisingly discovered it still wasn't for me. At this point, I'd invested £100 into my "Do I like Persona 5?" experiment and was quickly realising the result was a pretty firm "No, mate, you don't". So when I sat down with the PC version of the game on the Steam Deck to test it out, I figured I'd play it for a few hours and then never touch it again. I was wrong. I was so very wrong.

First-person shooters splintered near the turn of the millennium. Goldeneye 007, Half-Life, and Halo all had massive impacts on the genre, and their formulas would be the ones imitated for years after. The old key-hunt style of shooter practically died off, only to be revived recently. Now, the indie shooter marketplace is flooded with homages to the pre-3D accelerated years of gaming.
It’s the best time ever to start reassessing games that may have been overlooked. When it comes to leaving no stone unturned, Chasm: The Rift is one of the rockiest. Released in 1997 by Ukrainian developer Action Forms, it wasn’t one I was familiar with. As I looked into it, I saw it referred to as “poor man’s Quake” and “Eurojank.” Yet, those almost seem like terms of endearment, as it does h…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking cool, Joker!
Well, all you lovely people, it finally happened. After literally years of pretending like it wasn’t sure there would be an audience, Atlus has brought Persona 5 to the Switch. And though this belated port hasn’t brought with it any major new upgrades or changes, we’re pleased to report that Persona 5 Royal is every bit as magnificent and memorable an experience as it’s always been. If you’re an RPG fan and somehow haven’t yet gotten around to playing this game, you should pick it up as soon as possible.
Persona 5 Royal has a plot that feels like a cross between Inception and a superhero story, placing you in the role of Joker, a quiet high school student who has become a victim of circumstance. While walking home from school one day, you witness a woman being assaulted by a man and intervene. The man is accidentally injured and sues you for damages, which results in you being given a criminal conviction, expelled from school, and sent into the city to attend Shujin Academy. Not long after you arrive at Shujin, you gain the ability to access “The Metaverse”, an alternate plane of existence born out of people’s cognition. Within the Metaverse are Palaces — bizarre dungeons based upon the twisted way that certain people in power view real locations and people. For example, the first Palace is a castle ruled by Kamoshida, a physically and sexually abusive volleyball coach who sees Shujin Academy and its students as things to use as he pleases.

Since its updated and expanded Royal version dropped on PlayStation some years later, I've been afraid to make my return. You'd think I'd be itching to delve back into what's essentially the definitive version of the Phantom Thieves' adventure, and yet it's precisely because it blew me away the first time that I've been reluctant to go back.
Now? Now I feel silly. After playing the early portions of Persona 5: Royal, which finds itself coming to practically every remaining platform this week, including PC, my goodness me, it's wonderful to be back in Shibuya with the gang. Already it's the Persona 5 I adored, with new cutscenes and pacing adjustments to make it – somehow – even better. Have you never played Persona before? Good! Let me twist your arm.

Fire Emblem Engage is set to come to Switch on 23rd January, 2023, bringing the series to the new world of Elyos.

Summoned via magical rings, these legacy heroes — 'Emblems' — will be able to be called upon in battle to bolster your strength or to use their abilities alongside your own.

The Danganronpa series finally made the jump to Switch last year in the form of Danganronpa Decadence (alongside all three main games, and the brand-new Switch exclusive Ultimate Summer Camp getting individual digital releases), bringing murderous teddy bears and pink-splattered crime scenes to our screens. Series creator Kazutaka Kodaka is currently working on his next big project in the form of Master Detective Archives: RAIN CODE, but his previous work is always in the back of his mind.
In an excerpt from an interview with Twinfinite, Kodaka-san revealed that he always wanted to make a new IP after Danganronpa, but he's still definitely open to returning to the school halls of Hope's Peak Academy — or wherever Danganronpa may take him. He didn't ask developer Spike Chunsoft about making a new entry in the series because he wanted to make something new, but that doesn't mean it's all over:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well, I'll be Damned
A brief video posted to the Twitter of developer Grasshopper Manufacture has got fans wondering whether a new, horror-themed title is currently in the works at the No More Heroes studio.  The clip sees a developer hard at work designing a grotesque monster described as an "enemy boss" character.
The "Cultboss" creature — an amalgamation of twisted meat and skulls — looks particularly hellish, which has fans speculating as to whether a new Shadows of the Damned game is in development. Amusingly, asked about their thought process in drawing a 2D image from a completed 3D model, the developer candidly admits that they have "No idea" as they have "never done it before".
https://twitter.com/Grasshopper_EN/status/1581660988910161921?s=20&t=71a7YnTWo3TPJdFznjwUiA
The video itself is a teaser for Grasshopper Manufacture's media output, which includes its "Dev room shorts" videos, in-house documentaries, podcasts, and other behind-the-scenes content. At some point today/tomorrow, the studio will release a brand new interview with its irrepressible founder Goichi Suda — better known to video game fans by his moniker Suda51.  The interview will see the eccentric game designer reflect on titles such as The Silver Case, No More Heroes, and the studio itself.
"WATCH OR DIE!" demands the commercial.  Gee, I guess we better all tune in.
As for the origins of this mysterious monster... I guess we're just going to have to wait and see.

Cited as one of the greatest video games of all time, Perfect Dark is unfortunately rather difficult to find these days. Unless you're lucky enough to own an N64 console and have a copy of the original game, or have access to the remastered port on Xbox Live Arcade, then chances are you might never have played Rare's spiritual successor to GoldenEye 007.
Thanks to coder Ryan Dwyer, however, it looks like the classic FPS title may well be receiving unofficial PC ports in the future (thanks, VGC). Dwyer has successfully decompiled both NTSC versions of Perfect Dark, including the launch version and a later re-release that stamped out a number of bugs.

Nvidia announced an "unlaunch" of the graphics card, which would have sat below the RTX 4080 16GB and the RTX 4090, effectively cancelling it. The 16GB version will still release as planned on November 16th.


"The RTX 4080 12GB is a fantastic graphics card, but it’s not named right", reads Nvidia’s statement. "Having two GPUs with the 4080 designation is confusing. So, we’re pressing the "unlaunch" button on the 4080 12GB."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blast from the past.
Cast your minds back to August, 2001 (if you're old enough, that is!), you might remember that Nintendo hosted its last ever Space World event, during which it showed off a brief snippet of Super Mario Sunshine and introduced the world to the joys of cel-shaded Zelda (or 'Celda', if you like). The company was gearing up for the launch of the GameCube, which would release in Japan just one month later and in November of the same year over in North America.
The demo showcased for Super Mario Sunshine is noted for demonstrating a level not seen in the final product; an alternative version of Delfino Plaza that, if we're being honest, was probably best left on the cutting room floor. It also featured some unused NPC characters that we kind of wish made it into the final game; some of these guys look fantastic!

It appears that, right off of the bat, Blizzard Entertainment's decision to go free-to-play with its hero shooter sequel Overwatch 2 has the required effect — The studio has announced that the charismatic multiplayer title has already rocketed past 25 million players in its first 10 days of release.
The number far supersedes that of the original 2016 premium title, which hit around 15 million players during its early launch months.  Blizzard has also noted that daily player counts are already tripling those of the original Overwatch by almost 300%, though what percentage of these players are Reaper mains was not offered up at this time.

        <updated>2022-10-16T22:09:51.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Straight from the horse's mouth
Since the premature death of Silent Hills and the P.T. demo, we've seen a constant stream of supposed leaks and rumors about what will be the next Silent Hill game.  Plenty of people claim to have inside information, but this Wednesday, we'll hear it directly from the people who actually run the show.  Konami dropped word on Sunday that a Silent Hill Transmission will broadcast on October 19 and will feature "the latest updates for the Silent Hill series."
https://twitter.com/Konami/status/1581754864702398464
It's anybody's guess what we'll see in the show, but I'd put my money on Konami pulling back the curtain on that recently uncovered Silent Hill: The Short Message product listing.  Could The Short Message be a new game or a remake of one of the previous games in the series?  Is it that Abandoned game we've all stopped making fun of?  I used the Silent Hill: Shattered Memories key art in the banner image because Sam Barlow mentioned a follow-up to that masterpiece in the past.  And Masahiro Ito seems to be aware of it.  I guess as long as Konami isn't revealing a new pachinko machine, it should be worth tuning in for.
The Silent Hill franchise has been in purgatory for about a decade following the release of Downpour and Book of Memories in 2012.  Hideo Kojima famously tried to take the reigns of the franchise in 2014 with Silent Hills, but following a well-publicized fallout with Konami, he left the company and the project behind to form his own studio.  There have been many rumors of Kojima creating a Silent Hill game over at Kojima Productions, but there's not been anything concrete on that front.
Whatever it is, fans won't have to wait long. The Silent Hill Transmission is set for October 19 at 2:00 pm Pacific.

If you don't have access however, there's still time as you can still apply and more players will be let in over the course of this weekend. You might also enjoy watching some streamers play so you have a better sense of it ahead of its release in November.

You’re rolling the dice whenever you pick up a game with “Simulator” in the title. Is this going to be an attempt at accurately translating something into a video game, or is it going to abandon all reason and present some sort of unhinged parody? Priest Simulator is definitely in the latter category, but rather than just having some wacky controls that make the whole performance absurd, it goes a few steps further, into a storm drain, and gets washed out to sea.
You technically get up to some priest business in Priest Simulator. One could also argue that you even play as a priest. Maybe my knowledge of priestly happenings is skewed in some way, but if you asked me what a priest does, my answer would be: not this.

This week's Arcade Archives entry is coming to tug both your heartstrings and your marionette strings — Pulled out from Hamster Corporation's big bag of Namco classics, it's cartoonish obscurity Toy Pop, now available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.
Released to Japanese arcades in 1986, before later making its way to the Sharp X1 home computer, Toy Pop is a top-down, multi-directional shooter set within a colorful toy-based kingdom. Our heroes, Pino and Acha, are two dolls who must rescue their friends from the spell of the wicked witch, Mayjo. The two puppets climb the 44 floors of Mayjo's castle, freeing their friends and gathering food, treasures, and hearts in jovial, single-screen action.

The Mario games have been a core part of Nintendo fandom for decades now. Mario as a solo sibling has been around for even longer than his own series, first appearing — of course — as Jumpman in 1981's Donkey Kong.
Despite having his name in the title, the Mario franchise isn't about the Italian plumber alone. He was joined by his faithful brother Luigi in the first Mario Bros. arcade game in 1983, who also has a successful franchise of his own with the Luigi’s Mansion series. As well as that double trouble duo, you've got Princess Peach, Toad, Yoshi, and a bunch of antagonists to bop on the head as you run and jump your way through the Mushroom Kingdom. This cast of characters can also get quite competitive, whether playing Tennis or Golf or screaming around the track in a Mario Kart.

Earlier this month, PlatinumGames confirmed Hellena Taylor would not be returning as the voice of Bayonetta in the third outing Bayonetta 3 due to "various overlapping circumstances". In an update, the voice actor has now directly responded to this - taking to social media to explain in her own words why she didn't voice the character in the third game.
Long story short, she feels the offer of $4,000 USD "to do the whole game...as a flat rate" was an "insult" to her, and the amount of time she took to work on her talent and everything she had given to the fans and series. She also claims the "Bayonetta franchise made an approximated $450 million dollars...not including merchandise".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It means "village romanticization".
In an age where it feels like many big-budget projects are falling victim to 'FOMO mechanics' and stricter price schemes, it can be refreshing to play a game that focuses on simplicity, like Dorfromantik. Here you have a puzzle game that doesn't chase after complex mechanics, cutting-edge design, or intense action; Dorfromantik is simply about building warm, rural countrysides at your own pace. No pressure. No noise. And though it sacrifices some of its long-term appeal with this approach, we commend Dorfromantik for committing wholly to the peaceful atmosphere it endeavors to create.
Based around a simple score-based puzzle, you start off with a single hex tile floating in space and your goal is simply to build out a countryside as far as you possibly can by adding to it. Each hex tile in your stack has a collection of things like houses, forests, or rivers on its various edges and you get points for each edge you can match to an already placed tile.

In the years since we first ventured out onto the great plains of a truly open Hyrule in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, we’ve found all the shrines, defeated Calamity Ganon and scoured the kingdom for every last item and Korok seed. We’ve seen it all — and we went back to see it again in Labo VR — and now we’re looking for something else to scratch that Zelda itch. Tears of the Kingdom is coming, of course, but we need another hit.
We’re sure many of you can sympathise. A Zelda game is an event to savour, and the wait for the next entry can be tough. Breath of the Wild’s open world lasted us longer than most, but we’re getting anxious for another action-RPG fix. The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening was short and sweet, and Skyward Sword HD helped some, but we want more.

We did it, everyone. We made it through the working week with only 306 Pokémon Scarlet and Violet news drops to write of - perhaps this is a slight over-exaggeration, but you get the picture.

This week we were lucky enough to head behind the scenes at Ubisoft to get a look at Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope as the game nears release. We also got all nostalgic over the passing trend of hearing licensed music in video games, and we got a chance to chat to Sea Power - the geniuses behind Disco Elysium's soundtrack.

Overwatch 2 got off to a bumpy start, but in terms of the game's launch population, the sequel has apparently set an "all-time record" - reaching 25 million players in the first ten days of the game's availability.
In an official Blizzard press release, it was mentioned how this number was "nearly triple" the previous daily player peak" from the original Overwatch. Here's what company president Mike Ybarra had to say about this milestone:

Nintendo has taken the servers for Switch Sports down, suspending online play and save data backup while it investigates a new issues causing crashes.
As shared across the different Nintendo social accounts, a bug has been found in the latest Ver. 1.2.1 update of Nintendo Switch Sports. It's been causing crashes during the pre-match loading screen, affecting both online and offline play.
While Nintendo has suspended the roll-out of the update, it's also taking servers down temporarily while it investigates. Online play will not be available, obviously, and save data backup will be suspended as well.

A quick pause in play
Ver. 1.2.1 for Switch Sports was released earlier this week, on October 12. Its goal was to strengthen measures against disruptive behaviors. That entails any violations of Nintendo's Community Guidelines, including fraudulent behavior, including save data manipulation.
The previous update, Ver. 1.2.0, added a fair bit to the Wii Sports successor. One-on-one and four-on-four soccer got leg strap support, volleyball received a new slide attack move, and some nice features were added for online play.
In our review of Nintendo Switch Sports, it sounds like while the single-player progression wasn't the most rewarding, it still had a good bit to offer for multiplayer gatherings. And honestly, who doesn't have fond memories of bowling?
Hopefully the online sees a fix soon. Meanwhile, Nintendo Switch Sports is still due to receive its golf update, which was pushed out of September but should arrive sometime in the holiday season.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reeled back in before it got out
Nvidia has announced it is "unlaunching" one of its upcoming graphics cards. The RTX 4080 12 GB card was one of two 4080s set to launch next month, but Nvidia is halting the smaller of the two.
"The RTX 4080 12GB is a fantastic graphics card, but it’s not named right," reads a statement from Nvidia. "Having two GPUs with the 4080 designation is confusing."
So the 12 GB card will be "unlaunched," and the Nvidia RTX 4080 16 GB will still arrive on November 16.
The 4090, meanwhile, went live on October 12 and has been reviewing pretty alright as the powerhouse of the new line.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glz5B-4IlKE
What's in a name?
The name is one obvious distinction, as having two somewhat similar-sounding cards might be one issue. But the 12 GB and 16 GB configurations are actually a bit more different than the names might imply.
The hardware folks over at Digital Foundry did a breakdown of the distinctions between the two cards, as well as the 24 GB RTX 4090.
While the names imply a difference in VRAM, the 12 and 16 GB are actually fairly different cards. They have different core processors, with "wild variations" in the compute power and memory bandwidth. Nvidia's own benchmarks have been a bit weird too, compared to the previous 3000 generation of cards.
Suffice to say, it sounds like there were a lot of questions and concerns around this particular model, and Nvidia is taking the option to shelve it. Focus can all go back on to the 16 GB card and the 4090 that way.

Overwatch 2's launch has been nothing short of tumultuous, which game-breaking bugs and supposed DDoS attacks abound. There's still a lot left to be cleaned up, and while Blizzard has been clear that they're working to improve the game and fix the bugs as fast as they can, the company has made it clear that they won't be tweaking character stats or abilities for a couple of months.
A blog post from Blizzard's website (via Eurogamer) let players in on how the devs are feeling about the current state of the game -- when it comes to hero balancing, "[they] have been happy to see that no hero’s overall power level is far out of line with [their] goals."

In the section shown off, Isaac is trying to get back to the Refueling Station. This entails going back through the Machine Shop, which means backtracking. And as the developer points out in the voice-over, things may change a bit.
Different enemies may be around. Lighting and ambiance may have changed. The frights are a little less static, and rooms already traversed once are not safe forever.

Digital retail outlet Epic Games Store has revealed the identities of the next two games it will be offering up to its army of users free of charge — As of October 20, customers will be able to download both Bethesda's genre-defining sequel Fallout 3 and Shiro Games' cutesy RPG Evoland for a mighty zero dollars.

Originally released (to fevered anticipation) back in 2008, Fallout 3 was something of a watershed moment for the first-person RPG genre.

Are you adequately prepared to rock? Arc System Works sure hopes so, as next week will see the publisher launch an open beta to test the rollback netcode update for its excellent anime fighter Guilty Gear Xrd Rev 2 — The beta will kick off October 17 on the Steam release of the 2017 smasher.
While ArcSys is currently enjoying the fruits of more recent entry Guilty Gear Strive, its predecessor is still tightly-held by many of the GG faithful as one of, if not the, finest entry in the long-running fighting game franchise. Recognizing this, the developer is taking steps to ensure that those players who still wish to party like it's 2017 are afforded the best experience available, with the same silky smooth netcode that younger brother GG Strive offers.
To get folks in gear (pun fully intended) for the beta, ArcSys is also holding a slew of discounts on the Guilty Gear Steam back catalog. New and veteran players can bag several titles including Guilty Gear Xrd Rev 2, Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus R, and BlazBlue Cross Tag Battle, alongside their respective DLC, for hugely discounted prices. It should be noted that none of these games feature the new and improved version of Testament, but Baiken and Bridget are in the mix, so they're well worth your dollarydoos.
Prepare to meet Elphelt. Be very afraid.
Guilty Gear Xrd Rev 2 is available now on PS4 and PC. The rollback netcode beta test will take place from October 17 to October 31. In addition, Guilty Gear Strive is available now on PlayStation and PC platforms, with an Xbox port arriving in spring 2023.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A truly ribbiting reveal
A new Pokemon for the Paldea region makes its debut. Bellibolt, the EleFrog Pokemon, will be debuting in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet.
The new monster-pal for Paldea was teased earlier this week in a video, spotlighting the region's Electric-type Gym Leader Iono. Today, the Leader/influencer/streamer Iono returns to debut just what her partner Pokemon is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkfN-jyEcrI
Bellibolt is, as you can tell, an Electric-type frog. As Iono notes, those giant bumps on the side of its head are not eyes.
Instead, its actual face is that little smiley face you see in the middle, above its electricity-generating belly. A Bellibolt can expand and contract, generating electricity for shocking attacks it discharges from those bumps.
Its ability, Electromorphosis, is a new one. When Bellibolt is hit by an attack, it charges up, boosting the power of its next Electric-type move. Seems like it could be an interesting frontline tank for your Pokemon party.

A new pal in Paldea
Bellibolt is another in a string of reveals for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet. We've been gradually meeting more and more of the newcomers over the last few months. Pokemon like Wiglett, Grafaiai, and more are in store.
Plus, we're also getting a good look at some of the people living in Paldea too. Iono is the third Gym Leader we've seen so far, and will act as one of several the player will need to topple along Victory Road.
From auto-battling and TM crafting to the glorious lil' buddy called Lechonk, we're getting a pretty good idea of what's ahead for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet. The new generation of Pokemon games isn't too far off, either.
Pokemon Scarlet and Violet go live on Nintendo Switch on November 18, 2022.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Front Mission 2: Remake screens have appeared on the official Nintendo Store listing
While footage of the upcoming Front Mission remakes has been slim, new Front Mission 2: Remake screens give us a better look at the project. The screens come directly from the Nintendo Store listing, which was updated recently.
In case you haven't played the Front Mission franchise before, it's a classic tactical strategy game from G-Craft/Square Enix (then Squaresoft). It was wildly successful at the time, especially among SRPG fans, which led to these very remakes being dug up in the modern era. Developer Storm Trident and publisher Forever Entertainment (alongside of Square Enix) are handling the remakes.
Here's a quick brief on the second game, which takes place 12 years after the original:
"12 years have passed since the second Huffman conflict. The impoverished People's Republic of Alordesh has been suffering a severe economic decline ever since the war ended. In June 2102, soldiers of the Alordesh Army rise up and, led by Ven Mackarge, declare independence from the O.C.U. (Oceania Cooperative Union)."

As a reminder, Front Mission 1st: Remake is out in November, and Front Mission 2: Remake will be arriving in 2023. Nintendo also announced a Front Mission 3 remake project slated for "the future," though no window is in sight.

Citing 'unexpected challenges', Sega, Aspyr Media, and developer Amplitude Studios have announced that the console release of epic strategy title Humankind will no longer meet its November 2022 release date — No timeframe was offered as to when the PlayStation and Xbox ports would see the light of day.
"We and our partners have run into unexpected challenges in porting Humankind to consoles, and have to delay the release on Playstation 4/5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S until further notice," reads an unfortunate statement on the game's official blog.
"We know this will be frustrating for many of you, but we believe this delay is for the best, as we want to make sure to provide the best possible experience to console players. Unfortunately, we're not in a position to give a timeframe on a new release date right now, but we will update you all as soon as we can. In the meantime, anybody who has pre-purchased on digital storefronts will receive a refund where applicable in line with platform policy."
Officially launching on PC in the summer of 2021, Humankind is an evolutionary strategy simulation that is similar in fashion to the popular Civilization series, and tasks players with evolving Man as a species from rocks and fire through to the most contemporary and technologically sound eras imaginable. Of course, being human, there are plenty of pitfalls and barriers en route, including politics, famine, disease, and man's seemingly most popular pastime, war.
While critics were a little down on Humankind's "safe" approach to the evolutionary strategy genre, the title was praised regardless for its gameplay, structure, and general thematics. Now available to purchase on PC via Steam, PlayStation and Xbox players will have to stay tuned for further news of the troubled console port.

      <p>To celebrate Dead Space’s 14th anniversary, Motive Studio held a special livestream showcasing its upcoming remake of the game. The presentation featured an extended guided walkthrough showing off new gameplay footage as well as a rundown of features designed to make the game more terrifying than ever.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The video’s side-by-side comparisons illustrate the major differences between the original and the remake. One big change is that the Ishimura is now a seamless, interconnected ship that players can explore more freely. For example, using Isaac’s rocket thrusters to soar through areas you could only walk through before. A new system called the Intensity Spawn Director remixes necromorph spawn points, ensuring they’ll ambush veteran players in unexpected ways and, sometimes, in greater numbers. Dead Space also features improved necromorph dismemberment, new side quests designed to flesh out the supporting cast, new alternate fire modes for weapons, new puzzles, and more.&nbsp;</p>

You've likely seen similar games, but this one mixes the usual 2D pixel puzzle business with some hazardous platforming, and a cloning system that rapidly move beyond the obvious "standing on your own shoulders" uses.
The balancing of all that didn't quite work for me, but I'm generally fairly averse to puzzle games and demanding platformers, so you ought not to count that against it. If you're more the type to take apart a puzzle step by step than to wing it while your subconscious yells from the sidelines, this could even be a real gem.

Fledgling studio Dramatic Labs has announced that its graphic adventure game Star Trek: Resurgence will no longer meet its 2022 release date — The space opera adaptation will now launch in April 2023 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.
"Production has been advancing steadily all summer, but we have made the difficult decision to move our release date out of 2022 in order to give the game a final coat of polish, and create a truly immersive Star Trek experience," writes the developer in a statement posted to Twitter.
"Our love and admiration for Star Trek is instrumental to this decision. We're proud of what we've accomplished so far, and this continues to be a passion project for everyone here. We are incredibly grateful — and excited — to be able to work within a universe that means so much to so many. We can't wait for you to see it all and look forward to taking you on an adventure unlike any Star Trek game that's come before."
Originally revealed at The Game Awards just last year, Star Trek: Resurgence is a narrative experience in the vein of Telltale Games' litany of choice-based adventure games. Studio Dramatic Labs is itself made up of former Telltale Games employees, and thus one can likely expect the people politics, dramatic tension, and moral decision-making of games such as The Walking Dead, The Wolf Among Us, and Batman: The Telltale Series.
Star Trek: Resurgence will launch April 2023 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

It revealed Iona, a Gym Leader for next month’s game who looks like a vtuber  and clickbaits like one, too. Today, we get to know the brand new Pokémon who will be her in-game main.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A thousand apologies, friends, for the gap in your Nate Files timeline. Unfortunately, while on a deep sea dive to retrieve the tapes of episodes 13 and 14 (an expedition funded by supporters; your generosity is always appreciated), my ship was attacked by a large and unusually toothsome whale-like creature. The cursed thing took a huge bite out of the side of our noble vessel, The Squiggled Egg, and we were forced to abandon ship. It was only by the grace of the botswain Hughbert Threads that I'm alive to write this post today, as the man gave his life beating back the foul beast, giving a large part of the rest of the crew time to get away. Alas, in the confusion, I only secured episode 14, and episode 13 is now lost to time. That is definitely what happened, and not that the digital recording got mangled somehow.
Still, episode 14 (which is now episode 13, even though I say 14 in the recording) is now here for you to enjoy. It's all about bad and obsolete palaeontology - the weird ways people in history interpreted fossils, and why.

It's been quite some time since Sony put together a special bundle for one of its upcoming releases, but the industry giant is preparing to do just that with the launch of one of 2022's biggest releases, God of War Ragnarok, which will be bringing its skull-crushing chaos to PS4 and PS5 November 9.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcNalDmDrBU
The new God of War Ragnarok PS5 bundle will include a disc-based edition of Sony's shiny white baby, along with a standard controller and a digital download of Sony Santa Monica's highly anticipated sequel. The price for the new bundle is yet to be disclosed. A little bafflingly, this bundle will not include the recently announced God of War DualSense controller, which will be released as a separate standalone accessory.
The bundle was revealed as part of a new "Next Gen Immersion" trailer, which spotlights God of War Ragnarok running on the powerful PS5 platform. It should be noted that Ragnarok is a multi-generational release, so PS4 players will be able to pick up the new game for their platform of choice. Given how much the 2018 original made my PS4 sound like a Boening 747 was about to land, I dread to think how much the grand-looking sequel will get the black boxes sweating.
God of War Ragnarok launches November 9 on PlayStation platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Long Live the King
Gameloft has announced that it will be releasing the first major content drop for Disney Dreamlight Valley next week — Launching on PC and console platforms on October 19, the update will bring with it new story scenarios, a new Star Path, and will see the unwelcome arrival of the master of betrayal, Scar.
Scar, the antagonist of 1994's The Lion King, is the dishonorable brother of king Mufasa and the uncle of prince Simba. Wracked with jealousy and anger at his "hanger-on" status in the regal family, Scar surreptitiously befriends the hyenas of the Pridelands, ultimately executing a scheme that costs his brother his life, banishes Simba to the jungle, and sees Scar step in as king, leading to austerity, death, and the breaking of the ecologically vital "Circle of Life".
And now, he's gonna be your best pal. Thanks for that.
https://twitter.com/DisneyDLV/status/1580589187253805056?s=20&t=ftgLQxTwG0IakWIJAdC3YA
In addition to the arrival of The Lyin' King, the update will add a new "Star Path", (think Rainbow Six Siege's Battle Pass but, yknow, without all the killing?), offering up new items, decorations, and other goodies for your Animal Crossing Island Disney Dreamlight Valley. Players can also expect a new extension to the hobby title's story scenario, as well as several under-the-hood fixes, tweaking issues such from audio/visual problems to quest blockers, unresponsive NPCs, and other irritants.
Disney Dreamlight Valley is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch. You can check out our own CJ Andriessen's thoughts on the game in his Early Access Review right here.

These days, PC storage offers slightly larger capacities, but the thrill of having a really giant drive remains as strong as ever.
That brings me to the subject of today's deal post: the Crucial P3, a 4TB (!) NVMe drive capable of 3500MB/s sequential reads, is down to £299.99 at Amazon. That's a £90 reduction from its usual price, and an incredible deal for one of the biggest NVMe SSDs on the market.

Sega, in an effort to win over those still sitting on the proverbial fence, continues to roll out new trailers for its upcoming 3D adventure, Sonic Frontiers — The studio's latest trailer focuses on the skills and abilities that our iconic hero will put to use as he battles through a strange and esoteric new world.
While most fans of The Blue Blur has been happy to throw a lil' spin dashin' in harm's way, Sonic Frontiers will see the high-speed hog adopt a wide variety of new combat moves, ranging from dash kicks and punches to homing attacks, head stomps, and the return of the famous "Drop Dash" ability. Given that Sonic Frontiers' army of guardians is particularly well armored, with varying weak points, it will be up to the player to adapt to each encounter,…]]></summary>

Modern Warfare 2 players on both Battle.net and Steam will need to register a number.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hair today, gone tomorrow
Ramping up those hyper engines beyond capacity, Nintendo has released a four-minute trailer for its long-awaited sequel Bayonetta 3, ahead of the game's October 28 launch on Nintendo Switch. The new preview features the Umbra Witch in typically fine fashion, battling alongside new and familiar allies.
Titled "Bayonettas Everywhere?!" the trailer mixes fast 'n' frantic gameplay with snippets of the game's cinematics — perhaps showing a little more than is necessary, frankly. Our favorite hair-whipper is showcased battling an array of demons, monsters, and ghoulies, while tighter attention is paid to her new punk-rock protege, Viola. This young and spirited witch-in-training will accompany Bayonetta in her battle against a fearsome new enemy: the time-warping Homunculi.
You can check out the trailer below. Personally, I think it shows off a little too much story.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hh6bwdYgbio
In addition to the story and gameplay footage. The preview offers another look at the "Demon Masquerade" an ability that will allow the unholy one to channel various otherworldly beings — including demons Gomorrah, Malphas, and Phantasmaraneaeto — to both tweak her attack option and offer up brand-new combo routes, allowing our girl to switch up her battle abilities in the thick of the action.
More curiously, the trailer ends with a delightful-looking side-mode, that sees long-time Bayo pal Jeanne infiltrating a subterranean complex in delightful 2D action. The footage is reminiscent of the classic 1994 arcade release Elevator Action Returns, and is, surprisingly, one of the trailer's coolest elements. Bayonetta 3 might have teased us with the very longest of waits, but the sequel seems to be shaping up very nicely indeed. Besides, if we aren't being teased, is it even really Bayo?
Bayonetta 3 launches October 28 on Nintendo Switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scorn is a deliberately grim game with a lot of body horror. Best avoid it and this review if you have issues with body horror themes.
I was talking to a friend about Scorn and they asked, "Is there a story?". And yeah, Scorn has a story. At some point there'll be a two hour YouTube video outlining how it has a clear and nuanced plot, or that it's a metaphor for periods and erections, or both. In the immediate, it's about slithering out of a pod, staggering through the desert, and finding yourself in a strange, huge rotting machine made of rock and flesh that's already decades into abandonment and decay, and where most things look a bit penisy or womby. It's about the lizardy parasite latched to your back gradually transforming your body. It's about grim squishy noises and survival.
Scorn doesn't have dialogue, or a map. It doesn't really have a HUD, it doesn't have quest markers, and your character will not, upon seeing a strange new device, say something like "Hmm... seems like a key. Maybe if I find the two missing ones, it'll open up a way forward!" out loud. It won't even pull focus to the corridor you should check next. You just have to look around, experiment, and figure it out. I think I like it. I don't know if I can recommend it.

Even so, it's only a small percentage of players who actually play the campaign, let alone finish it (a statistic that is true of most single player games as well).

I make it no secret that farming/community simulators are one of my favorite genres, and this year has been full of sweet little games for me to cozy up on the couch with. Potion Permit is one of the titles I was looking forward to ever since I saw the first trailer, which showed off the game’s beautiful pixel art and colorful cast of characters. When it came to the gameplay itself, it looked to be pretty standard fare for the genre, with the exception of the farming side of things. In its place, the foraging and combat take center stage, as well as character-driven questlines.
Fortunately I was able to get a Switch copy of Potion Permit, because it’s one of those games that feels like it was made for a handheld console. It’s a great game to play when you have a few min…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Ryzen 7 5800X was a great gaming CPU when it launched in 2020, and it remains one of the fastest options going despite the recent release of Ryzen 7000 processors late last month. The 5800X also has two major advantages: it works on a wide range of cheap motherboards with DDR4 RAM, and it's way cheaper than the 7700X - especially when it's discounted on Ebay US, as is the case today!
So: let's cut to the chase. The 5800X is down to $229.99 at Ebay, from a list price of $449, meaning it's nearly 50% off. That also makes it $170 cheaper than the equivalent Ryzen 7000 processor, the $400 eight-core Ryzen 7700X. Or, to put it another way, you're paying around 60% of the price for at least 80% of the gaming performance of that newer CPU - not bad, given that you'll also pay way less for a complete Ryzen 5000 system (with AM4 motherboards and DDR4) than a complete Ryzen 7000 one (with AM5 motherboards and DDR5).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GinoMachino managed to do it, though
The Godskin Duo can be a huge barrier for first-time Elden Ring players, but months after launch, GinoMachino (as spotted by Gamerant) managed to beat them with their bare fists.
Described as a grueling "5.5 hour fight," they do wield a shield to parry (and use abilities), but damage is being done by way of raw punches. The fortitude required to pull off a run like this is frankly insane, as they rarely lose their cool during the run. If you want to check out the whole process, GinoMachino has a Twitch channel, and has titled the run "100 Punch Man."
The Godskin Duo are a tricky boss encounter, especially going in completely blind. While there are zones you can use in the arena to your advantage, and plenty of tricks/builds you can adapt to, the sheer chaos of the fight is tough to navigate your first time through. The gist is that both enemies are coming at you
Initially, I assumed that if you defeated both of them at the same time, the encounter would end. In my first blind pre-release review playthrough, I attempted to methodically bring both of them down to roughly 10% health, then defeat both of them simultaneously. Imagine my surprise when they both revived! Oops! Once I refocused and started to figure out when to take them down (and when their second phase was advantageous to trigger), everything clicked. But to be clear, I used weapons, not fists!
Elden Ring player beats Godskin Duo with their fists:

      <p>Bayonetta 3’s story has been one of its most speculated elements, and a new trailer shows off over four minutes of cutscenes and fresh gameplay. The multiverse takes center stage this time around, and&nbsp;we finally get real&nbsp;looks at the alternative versions of Bayonetta and what they bring to the table.</p>

<p>In addition to Bayonetta and Viola, we see what appear to be three Bayonetta variants. One has a youthful, almost teenage popstar look with strawberry-blonde hair and a hip-hop-esque fashion sense. Another version is clad in almost samurai-like armor. No matter the Bayonetta, the action unleashed by them looks as bonkers as you’d expect. For Jeanne fans, stay tuned until the end of the video, where we get a surprising look at a gameplay segment starring Bayo's BFF.</p>

All I've done is look at its screenshots and salivate at the mixture of 2D sprites, 3D environments, and tilt-shift camera trickery. 

Beyond that, I know that it's a strategy RPG, and I know that it's out on PC as of today.

Their own updates didn't add the show's omnipresent risk of cyberpsychosis, however, so a modder has stepped in to do it for them. The Wannabe Edgerunner mod adds a "humanity" cost to all cyberware implants and certain actions in the open-world shooter, as well as consequences for when your humanity gets too low.

This is hard for Matthew, because he hates the environment (unless his immediate environment contains a can of Rio).
Matthew comes through with an excellent Cavern Of Lies about trees and tree monsters in games, where he attempts to pull the illusive Double Beckford on us. Does he succeed? Listen to find out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Detective games are often about filling in the blanks. A terrible crime will sit at the heart of them, yes, but most take place in the days and weeks that follow, where the bulk of your time is spent gathering clues and building a case to work out whodunnit. Rarely do you get to glimpse the immediate aftermath of the crime itself, where all the major suspects are still in play and their pockets are stuffed with incriminating evidence they'll no doubt be disposing of in the coming minutes. 
The prime exception to this rule is Lucas Pope's Return Of The Obra Dinn, which gives you a time-travelling pocket watch to revisit the scenes of its many, many murders and work out exactly what happened to its 60-strong passenger list on its titular, ill-fated ship. Frogwares' Sherlock Holmes games and their mind palace visualisation techniques also warrant a mention here, and maybe even Outer Wilds at a push, if you count its 22-minute timeloop as an investigation scene several millennia in the making. But it's Obra Dinn that Color Gray Games emulate most strongly with their impressive debut in The Case Of The Golden Idol, which gives you a series of 12 murders to solve, each of which is presented as a freeze-frame vignette at the moment of death. You're still filling in blanks here, slotting names, objects and eventually verbs in its various scene scrolls to deduce whodunnit and howtheydunit, but this intriguing tale of 18th century high (and a secret) society, betrayals, backstabbing and murder most foul is a mystery game for the ages.

The way she wanted to organise keys wasn't what the game thought was the right way, and her article examined this frustration; she described the canonical correct solution as being that of a "domestic Joker".
The developers at Max Inferno Studios read this article and decided that, you know what? Alice0 was on to something. They contacted us to let us know that her piece was the inspiration for adding a feature called Let It Be, a skip puzzle function that you can access at any time. Anne Macmillan, who's a co-founder of Max Inferno Studios as well as artist and animator for A Little To The Left, was kind enough to talk to me about it.

I adore its linear mission structure that is completely at odds with the expansive semi-open world shopping mall in which it takes place. Hell, I even like its severely stripped down Wii port. I firmly believe that Dead Rising is an all-time great, but also understand why folks have (reasonably) cooled on the game’s particular quirks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, yes, it’s me, once again banging on about the WD Blue SN570. I just think it’s neat: a highly affordable yet remarkably quick M.2 SSD, with multiple capacities to choose from and regular sales making it even cheaper. Speaking of, today is the last day of the Amazon Prime Early Access Sale, which has the 1TB Blue SN570 down to £65.
That’s not quite its lowest price ever, but it does match its flash sale pricing during Prime Day back in July. And is an utter pittance for a 1TB NVMe SSD, let alone one that’s actually quite speedy. Amazon UK also have the 2TB version on sale for £128, just £1 more than its lowest dip on record (Prime Day 2022 again, as it happens). These prices are only available to Prime members, but the Blue SN570 ranks highly among the best SSDs for gaming, so they're well deserving of your cash if you’re in need of PC storage improvements.

Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier has waded in to allege that, while there will be some fresh COD in the offing, it’ll be in the form of something like a paid expansion for the upcoming Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 instead of a full game. A Modern Warfare 2.5, if you will.

Devs Volition insist this one’s just concentrating on hunting down and squashing the game’s many bugs. As we noted when it was released in August, Saints Row has rather a few technical issues. While Volition say this means they’re not at the stage where they can be “talking about roadmaps and expansions”, they are at least releasing a free cosmetic pack this week that includes some boots that look like bananas.

      <p>In the early '90s, the fighting game genre was a far cry from what it is today. Inspired by series like Final Fight, Kung-Fu Master, and Karate Champ, the fighting genre emerged in arcades, buoyed by a few significant players in the space. One of those franchises was Mortal Kombat, a bloody, gory fighting game that took concepts from other fighting games and dialed them to 11. The series became notorious for its spine-ripping, heart-grabbing, limb-chopping action, but beneath the controversies and the hearings was a technically sound, capable fighting game…]]></summary>

This punk rock-inspired warrior hails from another universe and is an Umbra Witch in training. She doesn’t have the same handle on her abilities as Bayonetta (nor her confident elegance), so Viola sports a vastly different playstyle that reflects her inexperience. </p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I picked up the Romancelvania demo at Steam Next Fest on Alice Bee's recommendation, and she was quite correct when she described it as "extremely relevant to [my] interests". So relevant, in fact, that I'm starting to wonder if this wasn't an attempt at psychological sabotage disguised as a friendly gesture. (You wouldn't do that to me, would you, Alice?)
Romancelvania is exactly what it sounds like: dating sim meets Castlevania. No idea how I missed it during my own perusal of the demo list, because unsurprisingly it's immediately become my favourite thing I've ever played at a Steam Next Fest. I was so drawn in, in fact, that I've been having a tough time putting it down, even when I really need to — hence my suspicion that this was some sort of test on Alice's part. No idea if I've succeeded or failed.
The demo starts on a promising note, awakening you in the persona of a comically brooding and exaggeratedly shirtless hunky Dracula. (The final game will include the option to play as a Lady Drac, if you prefer, who will not be shirtless, but not by a large margin.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oh my word, I'd forgotten about Sharkey's 3D Pool. What a grand old game. Apparently it was quite technically impressive for its time, as one of the very first 3D pool or snooker games. I wouldn't have known anything about that as an eight-year-old playing games after school. Much like I knew absolutely nothing about how to play pool well. I mainly just liked the noise it made when a ball was potted. Whether it was my ball or my opponent's ball: that was just extraneous detail.

      <p>Bayonetta 3 retains the over-the-top spectacle of its predecessors, but Platinum Games isn’t resting on the series' laurels. The game introduces several big additions, quite literally in some cases, to the game’s already winning formula, and you can check them out in this exclusive gameplay video.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Before we jump on what’s new, the core of Bayonetta 3’s combat remains the same, so veterans will find it easy to slip back into the fun dance of chaining combos, peppering foes with gunfire, unleashing torture attacks, and sp…]]></summary>

That’s okay, because devs Criterion Games have confirmed that you don’t have to play the game with great big puffs of colourful smoke dredging up from your car’s wheels, or cartoon wings popping out when you drive up a ramp and get some air. I’m into the effects myself, but it’s good to know you have the option to turn them off if you’re not.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coral Island  self-describes as a "reimagining of farming games", but if we're being real it doesn't reimagine the Stardew Valley template totally differently. The titular island, and your overgrown plot of farmland on it, has almost the same layout as Stardew Valley, and the tasks you do - growing stuff, keeping animals, making friends with locals, exploring a mine five levels at a time, and appeasing local spirits by giving them bundles of different crops - will also be very familiar to any DewHeads (that's what we call ourselves).
That's not to say Coral Island isn't good. It's all in very beautiful bouncy 3D, for one thing, and I found the island setting (which impacts the flora, fauna, and architecture in general) made everything feel less like work. Combined with a thread of environmentalism weaving through the game, and the fact that Coral Island is slightly easier than Stardew Valley, and you feel like you're doing more progress in less time. If you loved the vibe of ConcernedApe's smash hit, but found the need to hand-write your own almanac a bit intimidating, this is the game for you.

      <p>In each issue, <em>Game Informer</em> prints questions that are submitted by readers via email and standard mail. We'd like to give our website readers the chance to make the magazine as well.</p>

<p>You'll need to log in to your GI account and click "okay to print" for your letter or question to go through. We'd also love it if you included your location (city, state, or country will do). We'll look through the questions and pick a few to include in our next issue, which releases on November 8.</p>

<p>For each issue, we ask our community a question for our SoundOff section. This time around, we want to know...</p>

<p><strong>"Which video game franchise has the best soundtrack?"</strong></p>

<p>You can answer this question and/or include any other feedback you want. Thank you again for your support throughout the years, and we hope many of you get the chance to have your letter printed in an upcoming issue!</p>

This was back when cereal had that Happy Meal generosity, and you'd look forward to that thump as a gift caked in dust landed in your bowl.

Thankfully, fans only&nbsp;have to wait a few months before all three acclaimed RPG’s become available on modern platforms.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On January 19, Persona 3 Portable arrives on PlayStation 4, Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC via Steam. That same day, Persona 4 Golden will hit PlayStation 4, Xbox platforms (including Windows), and Switch. Both titles will also be available on Xbox Game Pass at launch.</p>

<p>Persona 3 Portable is the enhanced PSP port of 2007’s Persona 3 (which originally released on PlayStation 2). It launched in 2010 and has never been ported beyond Sony’s handheld. Similarly, Persona 4 Golden is a PS Vita title and the definitive version of its entry, Persona 4. Golden launched in 2012 and has only migrated to Steam, but that didn’t happen until 2020.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>The new guards of Batman's city rise up in the launch trailer for Gotham Knights released by WB Games&nbsp;Montréal today.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With just two weeks to go until the October 21 release date, marketing for Gotham Knights has begun to ramp up. We recently went hands-on with the game, and you can <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2022/10/05/hands-on-impressions-and-key-takeaways" target="_blank">read our impressions and key takeaways about how it plays now</a>, and recent videos have shared some of the <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/09/07/gotham-knights-behind-the-scenes-video-explores-comic-inspirations-and-narrative-design" target="_blank">behind-the-scenes inspirations for the game's narrative design</a>. But now, as the official release date draws nearer, WB Games&nbsp;Montréal is bringing the hype.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Check out the Gotham Knights launch trailer for yourself below</strong>:&nbsp;</p>

<p>As you can see, Gotham Knights' story of the Court of Owls and how they interact with both the Gotham Knights – Batgirl, Nightwing, Robin, and Red Hood – as well as other Gotham villain mainstays like Penguin, Mr. Freeze, Clayface, and Harley Quinn is shaping up to be something exciting for the Bat-verse of games. Fortunately, we don't have to wait too much longer now to experience it for ourselves because Gotham Knights hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on October 21.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>When Bayonetta 3's first gameplay trailer hit last year, her new braided hairstyle caught the attention of fans for its resemblance to the look of Cereza, the little girl who tagged along with players in the first game. <strong>Spoiler</strong> <strong>for Bayonetta 1</strong>: Cereza is the child version of Bayonetta, so perhaps our hero simply wanted to return to her adolescent roots. However, the third game's focus on the multiverse has prompted some fans to consider a more tantalizing theory. </p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2022/10/06/096f172a/nfs_unbound_screen_1.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="" typeof="foaf:Image" class="image-style-body-default" /></p>


      <p>EA has officially revealed Need For Speed Unbound, the first new Need For Speed game in three years, and it hits new-gen consoles and PC this December.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After leaking earlier this week, EA has released the official reveal trailer for Need For Speed and as leaks and rumors suggested, it's quite a drastic shift in style for the series. It features the slick realistic visuals fans of the series know quite well but this time, it's mixed with an almost anime-like animation style. It looks great, in my opinion, but it likely&nbsp;won't be for everybody.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Check out the Need For Speed Unbound reveal trailer for yourself below</strong>:&nbsp;</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true" src="https://players.brightcove.net/694940074001/rydylbNsz_default/index.html?videoId=6313356183112"></iframe>

<p>As you can see, Unbound represents a pretty drastic departure for the series in terms of visuals but elsewhere, it looks like Need For Speed. There seems to be plenty of car customization, cops to run from, city streets to speed through, and if the reveal trailer's song by A$AP Rocky is any indication, a great soundtrack.</p>

<p>Only time will tell but fortunately, we don't have to wait too long because Need For Speed Unbound hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on December 2. As you might have noticed, the reveal trailer doesn't mention consoles from the previous generation, like the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, so you might need a current-gen&nbsp;machine to play the game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Similar to Capcom's Monster Hunter series, the central draw of Wild Hearts is the massive creatures and how you successfully hunt them down. You&nbsp;craft new weapons and armor along the way, growing stronger and stronger with each hunt, as you attempt to rid the land of Azuma of these beasts. The reveal trailer released last week gave some quick glimpses of what that looks like, but a new gameplay trailer showcases seven minutes of Wild Hearts gameplay.&nbsp;</p>
