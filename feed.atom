WarioWare: Move It is full of truly surprising games that take advantage of the Switch's unique control options, but it's arguably always the most fun to see what retro Nintendo games make it into any WarioWare collection.
Join Brian Shea and me as we go through all of them and even see what some of the game's look like when played at their second and third tier.

Konami's Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1 arrived on the Switch last week, and Digital Foundry have now released its technical analysis of the entire collection.
DF gets right into it, claiming it "could, and should have been so much more", explaining how the collection presents Metal Gear Solid 1,2, and 3 with "limited enhancements" over any previous iteration of these games.

WarioWare: Move It! is finally available on the Nintendo Switch today. We've seemingly got a confirmation on the voice actor (it appears to be Kevin Afghani) and Nintendo has already released some new themed Switch Online icons for the game.
All of this has got us wondering if you'll be diving into Wario's latest microgame offering. In our review here on Nintendo Life, we called it a fine return and awarded it a solid 8 out of 10 stars. So vote in our poll and leave a comment below.

Square Enix's legendary game Super Mario RPG returns later this month on the Nintendo Switch, and ahead of the November 17th release, the final round of previews have gone live.
If you haven't already seen our own "hands on" of this upcoming Switch title, here on Nintendo Life, the good news is it's shaping up to be something pretty special. In fact, it might just be the most faithful remake we've ever played.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the wake of devastating layoffs at Destiny 2 developer Bungie, the studio has said this week has been “one of the most difficult weeks” in the studio’s history. To move forward, it is now committed to making the upcoming Destiny 2: The Final Shape expansion one of “the best games we’ve ever made.” 


“We know we have lost a lot of your trust,” the Destiny 2 development team wrote in a blog post. “Destiny needs to surprise and delight. We haven’t done this enough and that’s going to change.”


To start, the studio says it has “more than 650 dedicated teammates pouring all their energy and expertise into delivering” The Final Shape, in addition to the Episodes that will follow. Bungie says fans can expect to hear more about the future of Destiny 2 “in the weeks ahead.”


In the latest example of a long line of games industry layoffs, Bungie laid off an estimated 100 employees according to Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier in late October. Schreier also reports The Final Shape will see a delay, as well as Marathon.


This instance is simply the latest in a long string of layoffs and shutdowns in the games industry. Other studios that have experienced layoffs include Epic Games, CD Projekt Red, Naughty Dog, Twitch, and Ubisoft, among many, many others. Studios that have been shut down include Volition Games, Dang!, Vanpool, and PixelOpus.

Max Payne popularized bullet time in video games, while Control was one of the most complex implementations of ray tracing at its launch. With Alan Wake 2, Remedy has done it yet again, this time with its narrative, offering a mind-bending postmodern experience that goes places no other gaming story has.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are very pleased to announce today the start of the testing period of two single-game engines: Kingdom: The Far Reaches and Escape From Hell!
Kingdom, was developed and released by Interplay in 1995. Only the DOS version of the game (available on gog.com) is supported. It's a cartoon FMV game, with an inventory, in which you have to guide Lathan Kandor through a medieval world, discovering the magic spells and the items required to defeat an evil wizard. 
Escape From Hell, was developed for Electronic Arts by the game veterans Richard Seaborne and Alan Murphy and was released in 1990. You play Alan in this keyboard-only Role Playing Game and visit Hell, looking for your girlfriend who was accidentally teleported there.
Both games use heavily hardcoded logic which is error prone and requires a lot of testing, so we need your feedback more than ever as they are both incompletely tested. There is sadly only one known demo for Kingdom. Support for the Windows and Mac versions of Kingdom may come later! Please contact us if you have some other demos of both games.
To play any of these games, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker and please take some screenshots along the way!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat 1 has a hell of a DLC lineup on the way. Today's Omni-Man gameplay trailer showcases why he may just be the most badass of the bunch when he arrives this month.


Just as in the Invincible animated Amazon series, Omni-Man is voiced by the ridiculously awesome J.K. Simmons. Throughout the trailer, NetherRealm Studios shows off the actor's skills as he relentlessly mocks Liu Kang and his allies prior to beating the hell out of them. 




We've seen what Omni-Man is capable of in a previous Mortal Kombat 1 trailer. But today's video puts the Viltrumite's full abilities on display. He's brutal, nimble, and of course, deadly. You don't need a subway train to showcase that. 


A new kameo fighter is also on the way alongside Omni-Man's debut next week. Tremor, who originally debuted in 2000's Mortal Kombat: Special Forces, is a ninja like Sub-Zero and Scorpion but with earth powers. He pairs nicely as a kameo higher alongside Omni-Man. While the Invincible villain is pulling meteors from the atmosphere and smashing opponents with them, Tremor is doing the same with giant boulders right here from Earth. 


Both combatants will join the fray on November 9 for those with the Kombat Pack. They are available a week later for everyone else as standalone DLC.


Following that, there's plenty more DLC in the pipeline. Quan-Chi and DC's Peacemaker are slated for sometime in the winter. Ermac and The Boys' Homelander are planned for spring. The apprentice of Scorpion himself, Takeda Takahashi, should be out as a playable fighter next summer. And Ferra, Janet Cage, Khameleon, and Mavado are all in the works as additional kameo fighters. 


If you haven't given Mortal Kombat 1 a try, perhaps you should. In Destructoid's review, we thought it was great.

It's the city, personified


Peter and Miles often face an onslaught of action in New York, but Spider-Man 2 side quests offer moments of respite. They're opportunities to truly live in the Big Apple, listening to citizens' stories, and enjoying an extra puzzle or two.

Perhaps among the more noteworthy includes 2021's Aliens: Fireteam Elite, a third-person survival shooter with both PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 versions. Back in the day, Destructoid reviewed the title, scoring it at a whopping 5.5. 


Fireteam Elite sees a squad of three marines, whether cooperatively with friends or alongside AI, explore the caves and ruins of the mysterious planet LV-895. Players can build up their marine's skills across six different classes with 130 different perks. All in an effort to fend off Xenomorphs, Spitters, a…]]></summary>

This one was announced back in September and came to other platforms last month while the team put the finishing touches on the Switch version.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are quite a few here at Destructoid that are big into anime, so this is for them as well. For a limited time only, Twitch is offering viewers a free trial of Crunchyroll, the hit animation streaming service, for your viewing pleasure. 


As outlined in a recent Twitch blog post, the Amazon-owned platform is providing a 60-day trial of Crunchyroll Mega Fan Premium membership. This means you'll get to watch all your favorite anime and manga shows without ads.


Image via Twitch.


Of course, it's not as simple as just holding out your hand and waiting for the trial to drop into it. There are a few provisos before you can qualify. Because of course there are.


*Sigh* Okay, what do I have to do?


For starters, the campaign is only being run for this month, so you have until November 30 to get your free trial. In exchange for the Crunchyroll membership, you'll need to purchase "two new Twitch subs and/or gift subs."


The type of Twitch subscriptions and gifted subs that are eligible include:



New monthly subs (any tier)


Multi-month subs (3-month, 6-month)


Gift subs (any tier for any number of months)



Prime subs, existing sub renewals, bits, turbos, and a bunch of others don't qualify.


It's also worth noting that it's only available on "participating channels streaming in the Just Chatting, Art, and One Punch Man: World categories." You also can't qualify for the offer if you live in any of the following countries:



Russia


Ukraine


Cuba


China


Iran


Japan


North Korea


Syria


South Sudan


Sudan



What else? Oh, yeah: "existing or past Crunchyroll members or users who have previously claimed a Crunchyroll free trial in the past year are not eligible."


I think that covers everything. As is typical with these types of deals, there are plenty of Ts & Cs before you qualify. If you do quality, happy days. If not... Young Sheldon, I guess.

        <link href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/football-manager-2024-review"/>
        <updated>2023-11-02T17:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like when Sir Alex Ferguson oversaw his final game at Old Trafford, there’s a complicated atmosphere surrounding this year’s Football Manager. Football Manager 2024 is the last iterative game in the series before Project Dragonfly arrives next year, through which Sports Interactive plan the most radical overhaul of the game since the introduction of the 3D match engine in FM 09. This includes a complete rebuild of Football Manager in Unity, implementing brand new animation technology, and the inclusion of women’s football. But there is a reason why the studio has stuck with this tried and tested formula for so long. Big changes come with big risks, and as any Man Utd fan will know, those changes don’t always pay off.


But such concerns are for the future. FM24 is with us right now, and while it may be swapping the dugout for the stands ninety minutes from now, this isn’t some ceremonial exhibition match. It’s business as usual, and in mostly good ways. Sports Interactive have made meaningful changes to the management game both on and off the pitch, all built on top of fundamentals that remain as complex and compulsive as they have for years. That said, FM24 also demonstrates why a change is welcome, as in its current form it can struggle to strike the balance between authenticity and fun.

I rarely replay games, let alone horror games, which are often one-and-done sorts of things - though I do, of course, enter the Pumpkin Carving Festival every year.
I want something that has a general air of spookiness without being a jumpscare frightfest. If I hadn't played The Tartarus Key already I'd be playing that, is what I'm saying. But the other day I played the demo for An English Haunting and it's exactly what I want. It's just not going to be out for a while. Rats!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amidst all the remakes that are crowding the current gaming market, Skyblivion is definitely one to look out for. While there's still some time until we can expect a proper release date, the team behind the ambitious Oblivion remake has released a hair-raising video update.


Over on YouTube, the unofficial fan remake of TES4 lets its cape down to bring a more sinister vibe in promoting Skyblivion. The video showcases some of the darker and scarier elements of this Oblivion reimagining.




Among other things, we get a glimpse of some areas that have been given a new spit shine in Skyrim's engine, including Hackdirt and Arkved’s Tower. We also get a look at some new monsters that have been made specifically for this project. There's even a quest walkthrough, as well.


When is it coming out?


At the moment, there's no definite release window for Skyblivion yet, outside a likely 2025 launch. It is, after all, quite the undertaking, completely reimagining Oblivion in Skyrim's engine. Volunteers are always welcome as well, if you do want to lend a hand.


We've seen in the past that the remake is coming along nicely, and with each update we get, we move closer to the project becoming available.


Having started back in 2012, the fan remake has been in development for over 13 years at this point. However, it's looking more and more like it's going to be worth it in the end. You'll also be pleased to know that it'll be completely free, providing you have legitimate copies of Oblivion and Skyrim (natch).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Larian Studios has pushed through a massive Patch 4 to Baldur’s Gate 3, applying over 1000 fixes, tweaks and changes. Accessibility is a major focus of this patch, in addition to other fixes applied to the hirelings system, combat, and UI.


To start, the team has implemented a setting that allows color-blind players to choose between protanopia, deuteranopia, or tritanopia, which applies to character outlines, circles, character map markers, frame portraits in turn order, and party portraits. For those unfamiliar, protanopia and deuteranopia corresponds to red-green color vision deficiency, while tritanopia is blue-yellow.


In addition, the appearance of hirelings can now be customized when recruiting them. Also, dead avatars can be sent to Withers’ Wardrobe of Wayward Friends, and the enigmatic skeleton will explain how the feature works for those who are unfamiliar.


In terms of gameplay, several autosaves have been added to the Shadowlands, Wyrm’s Crossing, and the Lower City, including at the Steel Watch Foundry, the Iron Throne, and Rivington. There is now an option to make the ‘end turn’ button need to be held rather than tapped, for those of us who needed that.


I think one of the fixes I’m the least happy about is in the fight with a certain boss in Act 3. It’d seem you can no longer push him into a chasm, because apparently logic kicks in and he remembers he has a natural defense to sudden gravitational shifts.


Also, one of the most important things in Act 3 has been corrected — Yenna now returns to camp after the avatar of Bhaal kidnaps one of your friends instead of inexplicably disappearing. I always wondered about where she went, but it made such a minimal impact on my campaign that I just shrugged it off.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The 2002 PS2 title, Boku no Natsuyasumi 2 has received a fan translation. Surprisingly, this came out before an anticipated fan translation of the original PS1 game.


Previously, Boku no Natsuyasumi 2 was only released in Japan on PS2 (later ported to PSP). For that matter, the entire series never really left Japan. Part of the sudden rush is due to more Western awareness of the titles, especially in the wake of Action Button’s six-hour review on the title. It’s really hard to write that out without adding an expletive. Let’s just say I don’t have the attention span to watch it.


I also often joke that, because Boku no Natsuyasumi is popular, I probably wouldn’t like it. In all honesty, it’s probably directly up my alley. The title translates pretty directly to “My Summer Vacation,” but …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Nintendo Museum’s sign and official logo were recently revealed by Nintendo Japan on their official Instagram account. Although the sign isn’t super flashy or extravagant, it still looks crisp and welcoming for future fans to admire while paying a visit to the historical site.


During a Direct in September, the gaming giant teased fans with the museum. In the Instagram post that Nintendo Japan posted on October 26, the sign and logo can be seen from a number of different perspectives, showing off the sign from different times of the day.


Currently, the museum is under construction in Uji City, Kyoto Prefecture, near Kyoto, Japan. The renovations and construction work are set to be completed in March 2024. The sole purpose of the long-awaited project is to provide fans with a glimpse of the company’s legacy, history, and highlights through a well-laid-out collection of its past.


History of the Nintendo Museum Site


Image via Nintendo


Back in 2021, Nintendo announced the renovation of one of their old facilities, its Uji Ogura Plant. First built in 1969, the plant’s original purpose was to produce playing cards and Hanafuda cards. Later on, the plant became a customer service hub, for the company’s products to be repaired. 


The renovations announced include both the plant and the land surrounding it. Originally, this project was planned to be called the Nintendo Gallery with a similar concept and approach to its current museum idea.


We'll hopefully see more than just a sign in the months to come, leading up to the Nintendo Museum's opening.

        <updated>2023-11-02T16:04:37.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Veteran MMO Developer Greg "Ghostcrawler" Street announced his new games studio, Fantastic Pixel Castle, earlier today on Twitter. Fantastic Pixel Castle appears to be a first-party studio that is being fully-funded by NetEase, who has been ramping up their investment in MMO  companies recently. According to Street, Fantastic Pixel Castle is already working on an epic AAA MMORPG codenamed Ghost.




A studio full of veterans


Looking over the "Our Team" section on the Fantastic Pixel Castle website, it looks like the studio already has a ton of talent. Studio Head and Game Director Greg Street himself has worked on World of Warcraft, Age of Empires, League of Legends, and the highly anticipated Riot Games MMO.


Another World of Warcraft is Brian Holinka who served as Lead Combat Designer on WoW for over a decade.


Other industry veterans listed include Bart Tiongson, Candace Thomas, David Kubalak, Ed Altorfer, Graham Berger, and more. Overall it looks like a very talented team at Fantastic Pixel Castle, so I'm excited to see what they are working on.


Codename Ghost


Details on the in-development MMO codenamed Ghost are sparse, but Street and the team have a stream planned for November 8 at 2 p.m. ET to reveal more details on the project. According to Street the MMO is very early in development, so fans should not expect any sort of gameplay footage, but rather more details about systems and design philosophy.


In Ghost, players will travel to world shards to power up their characters, bring back resources, and build their own civilization. In turn, the city will grow and evolve based on choices and actions of the players across seasons.


Based on a section on the website, Ghost will originally launch on PC, with the goal to ship on consoles at a later date. The team also plans to ship their game globally and localize it into many languages.

Well, maybe not no reason. It’s still Nate.


Plus! We talk about what we’ve been playing this week, which coincidentally for me was The Finals, while Nate’s been digging deeper into the Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor demo.

It's billed as a detective game for true crime fans, but it reminds me of those puzzle books you used to get, where you are shown an illustration of a crime scene and, if you stare at it long enough, can figure out the assigned solution. Scene Investigators is like that but the scene is a big 3D one you can walk around. A crime has happened and you need to figure out what, mostly by peering at the dates in a diary to cross reference them with the time and day a phone message was left. This is why I wouldn't recommend it to everyone. It's quite hard. But! Some people will really like it.

Dark Chambers was released in 1989, extremely close to the end of the 2600’s lifespan. Hah! Except, not it wasn’t, because Dark Chambers is actually just a rework of Dandy, a game originally released in 1986 on early home computers. But wait, it gets stranger.


Going back to the beginning, Dandy was developed by John Howard Palevich. It’s a dungeon crawler inspired by Dungeons & Dragons. In fact, the name is based on the abbreviation D&D. Dandy plays like a prototype of the popular arcade Gauntlet, and that’s because it basically is. A perpetuated gaming myth (as in, I can’t find an authoritative source) is that Palevich sued (or threatened to sue) Atari over Gauntlet taking …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Twitch is pulling support for the version of its app currently available for the Nintendo Switch. The Twitch support page states that it will be “ending support” for the Switch Twitch app early next year.


Those who currently have the app downloaded to their Switch will lose access on January 31, 2024. For those who wish to download it, you'll have until November 6. Nintendo hasn't made any official comment on the matter yet.


The streaming service has been available in the Switch eShop since late 2021 and provided a “flexible Twitch viewing experience” where you can supposedly “watch, follow, or interact with any broadcaster or channel live on Twitch,” according to the app. But many say that this isn’t necessarily true.


Reoccurring Issues with Twitch


Image via Twitch Support


Many fans seem to feel the app didn’t necessarily do what was expected of it, generally causing people to complain about the app’s performance. Users within the r/NintendoSwitch Reddit stated that they were unaware of the apps existence on the Switch. 


A user under the name throwmeaway1784 said, "This is how I find out the Switch even had a Twitch app." Here are a few issues many have found within the app:



Not able to see that chat during streams


Unable to subscribe to creators


Cannot broadcast to Twitch from the app



Our own Eric Van Allen says he's used the app on occasion, but only as a last-ditch effort. Mostly, he says, it's a means to an end, but definitely not an ideal way to watch Twitch.


Although the Nintendo device will no longer be supporting the app, the company says that Nintendo is still a “valued partner” and they “appreciate all of the support the Switch community has provided to Twitch and our streamers.”

After last week's announcement that Disney Dreamlight Valley will be officially leaving early access on 5th December (and no longer as a free-to-play game), publisher and developer Gameloft has hosted a showcase to share what we can expect to see coming to the title over the next few months.
The first big announcement to come our way was that The Nightmare Before Christmas' Jack Skellington will be stepping into the Valley as a part of the game's eighth content update (also releasing on 5th December). According to the Dreamlight Valley blog, you should keep an eye on the "most moody biome" for hints of his arrival.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The second half of the Pokémon Scarlet and Violet DLC is officially on the schedule. The Pokémon Company announced that you can catch the Indigo Disk when it's released on December 14.


The latter half of The Hidden Treasures of Area Zero DLC will be arriving for Nintendo Switch systems on December 14, 2023. The Indigo Disk takes players to a much different biome of sorts: the Blueberry Academy, an advanced school located in the middle of the ocean.




We've seen a good deal of info about Indigo Disk already, including its battle-focused structure and open area. The Pokémon Company revealed in August that all of the mainline Pokémon series' starters would be in the new zone. However, it wasn't clear if that included Quaxly, Sprigatito, and Fuecoco of Scarlet and Violet.


The first half of The Hidden Treasures of Area Zero, The Teal Mask, arrived for Switch players in September. Our review essentially described the new content as more of the same. There was a new location introduced (Kitakami) in the DLC which offered a campaign of four or five hours. There were additional side quests, a handful of new Pokémon, new outfits, and a few other extras. But no real corrections were made to the core issues that plagued this Pokémon generation since launch.


We'll see how the Pokémon Scarlet and Violet The Indigo Disk fares when it arrives in December.

I hold its metal head in my hands, tilting it this way and that as I stare into its cold red eye. It offers no resistance to my pushes and pulls, as though I was a hairdresser directing a patron’s head. Based on Stanisław Lem’s 1964 novel of the same name, The Invincible’s Firewatch-like first-person adventure is intent on exploring how machines will come to shape humanity’s future. Over the course of its ten-hour story, where you step into the Soviet-styled space boots of biologist Yasna, you will take on her desperate search for the missing crew of her research ship, The Dragonfly, lost somewhere on the rocky, sandstorm-whipped world of Regis III.
Using a logbook filled with hand-drawn maps and scrawled notes, I’ve tracked Yasna’s crew to a makeshift game to the east of where they originally landed. Instead of humans, I find the lifeless robot. I want the android to give me answers, to tell me where my crew mates are, to explain what happened on Regis III, and why I can’t remember anything before I woke up in the desert with my possessions scattered around me.

Take a look at any Best Super NES RPG list and you’ll see a veritable bounty of genre favourites. Chrono Trigger. Final Fantasy VI. EarthBound. Terranigma. Dragon Quest V. The fact that Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars often finds itself on those lists is a real testament to its status as a classic.
In 2023, we’re getting the chance to relive the origins of Mario’s RPG adventures in Super Mario RPG, a Switch remake of the 1996 original, which saw Nintendo and Square team up to blend Mario’s colourful platforming charm with traditional turn-based RPG mechanics. And, after playing through the first three hours of this remake, we’ve been reminded of just why Super Mario RPG is often considered not only one of the best SNES RPGs but one of the best RPGs ever.

Ahead of Super Mario RPG’s launch on November 17, I got to play this new twist on an old classic. Based on this experience, much of this remake felt the same as the SNES classic it’s based on. Yet despite only featuring a few small tweaks to the original game, what I played was remarkably fresh, even by modern standards.

Back in the '90s, Nintendo played faster and looser with its library of characters. Sometimes Yoshi showed up in The Legend of Zelda, and Kirby was whatever color he felt like at the moment, be it gray or pink. In 1996, that laissez-faire attitude was in full effect for the release of Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars for the Super Nintendo. Link, Samus, and even Donkey Kong (sort of) all had inexplicable cameos in the game, and one of my big questions about the remake was whether or not those would move forward. If you're ready to learn the answer for at least some of them, read on!
Impressively, the answer is yes! At least for Link and Donkey Kong. I have not been able to play to the point in the game where Samus appears, so I can't answer that question yet. When you get close to Link after seeing him in the sleeping bed, a "talk" option appears, and when you click it, a Zelda musical sting plays.
Donkey Kong's cameo has always been questionable as to whether or not it is him, as he is just labeled "Guerilla", but he sure looks a lot like Donkey Kong, just with a crown.

The Super Mario RPG remake releases November 17 for Nintendo Switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Omni-Man, the J.K. Simmons-voiced character from the Invincible animated series, is coming to Mortal Kombat 1 next week on November 9. Ahead of his debut, NetherRealm Studios has released the official Omni-Man gameplay trailer and alongside hard-hitting (and gory) super moves, it features a brutal and show-accurate fatality for the character. 
The trailer teases Liu Kang for allowing a Viltrumite into the Realms of Mortal Kombat before more than two minutes of Omni-Man action plays out. And closing out the trailer is the fatality for the upcoming Kombat Pack character. We won't spoil it here, so check it out in the Mortal Kombat 1 Omni-Man gameplay trailer below: 


Omni-Man hits Mortal Kombat 1 as part of the first Kombat Pack on November 9.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in August, a Pokémon Presents revealed that the first part of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet's DLC, collectively known as The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero, would hit the game in September. That has since come and gone, with players eagerly awaiting the second part of this expansion. And now, the official Pokémon Twitter account has revealed The Indigo Disk DLC goes live next month. 


More specifically, The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero Part 2: The Indigo Disk hits Pokémon Scarlet and Violet on December 14. As those keeping up with Game Freak's ninth generation of Pokémon know, The Indigo Disk brings players to Blueberry Academy, which is actually in the Unova region, rather than the Paldea region where Pokémon Scarlet and Violet take place. The Unova region is the setting for Pokémon Black and White, and their sequels, Pokémon Black 2 and White 2.

November 2, 2023
Many players are speculating that The Indigo Disk will, in some way, tease remakes of the fifth generation of Pokémon, as those are next in line for Game Freak's cadence of remaking previously released Pokémon games. With players leaving Paldea to check out an academy in Unova, many predict some hint at potential Pokémon Black and White remakes await trainers. But only time will tell. 
Pokémon Scarlet and Violet: The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero Part 2 – The Indigo Disk hits the games on December 14. The DLC can be purchased as a pack for $34.99. 
For more, read about how after The Indigo Disk is out, every starter Pokémon will be available in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, and then read Game Informer's Pokémon Scarlet and Violet review.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There comes a point when adding yet another behemothic RPG to your collection of unfinished, behemothic RPGs ceases to be a mark of eccentricity and becomes an act of manifest self-hatred. I, for instance, have just activated a beta code for 100-hour levelling fest Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader even as I make a mental note that really, I've got to make some proper headway in Baldur's Gate 3 this evening.
For The King 2, at least, seems pretty trim and digestible at a reported 30 hours in length. Released out of early access today, it's a blend of fantasy table-top gaming and roguelite, in which you lead a party of adventurers across a hexagonal map to quash an evil Queen in grid, dice and turn-based combat.

        <updated>2023-11-02T13:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What kind of game does the label “survival horror” denote? Since its inconspicuous first appearance in the original Resident Evil’s loading screen (functioning first and foremost, lest we forget, as a handy marketing catchphrase), the term has been so enthusiastically embraced and haphazardly applied as to be rendered almost meaningless in 2023. Horror gaming has witnessed multiple seismic shifts since 1996, most notably the turn to action-oriented design with the likes of The Suffering and Resident Evil 4 in the mid-2000s, as well as the rise of spooky almost-walking-simulators like SOMA in the mid-2010s. 

Yet the term survival horror has expanded to such a degree that it now seems to stand in, albeit rather awkwardly, for the entirety of video game horror. Even with the caveat that borders for these kinds of labels are notoriously hard to define, survival horror remains an unusually amorphous realm, one that (as a quick search of the relevant tag on Steam will reveal) lays claim as much to first-person bloodbaths like Zombie Army Trilogy as it does moody, combat-free adventures like Visage. Still, old distinctions linger, and a clutch of recent indie survival horrors qualify their work with the word “classic”. I interviewed some of the developers to find out why - and, more importantly, what classic survival horror means.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Game Informer can exclusively reveal Assassin's Creed Valhalla: The Hidden Codex, a new graphic novel from Dark Horse Books that brings players back into the world of assassin Eivor, a medieval Nordic land, a new hidden order, and more. It will be released as a hardcover graphic novel on April 30, 2024, in retail stores and online, for $19.99 (and it hits comic book stores on May 1, 2024). Mathieu Gabella is the author, with art from Paolo Traisci. 
The Hidden Codex follows Edward, a scribe and reluctant monk after he escapes from a kidnapping performed by a clan of Vikings. After securing his freedom, Edward finds his brother missing and strange documents "blackened by a language he innately understands." 
"No one knows where these occult-looking symbols came from, but Edward has seen such writings before: in the workshop of an enigmatic wise man among the Vikings who is part of a secret order: Those Unseen," a press release reads. "An order that could offer answers to Edward, and guarantee his aspirations of freedom and knowledge. But with that knowledge, can he find and rescue his own brother before it's too late?"
Ubisoft senior transmedia content manager Etienne Bouvier says the company is lucky to work with Gabella and Traisci as they are two long-standing fans of the Assassin's Creed franchise who infused their love of it, and knowledge of its lore, into this book. 
Assassin's Creed Valhalla: The Hidden Codex hits bookshelves and online retailers on April 30, 2024, before it hits comic book stores on May 1. It is available for preorder now and costs $19.99.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Years into development, there's still no sign of when Skywind will see the light of day. However, the team behind the fan remake of Morrowind has shared what was technically a Halloween teaser.


Showing the spookier side of this unofficial project, we get another glimpse of Skywind in its current state (thanks, DSO Gaming). Here we have a small taste of some of the more unsettling creatures that will await us, as and when it comes out.




As for a release date, we still don't have one. We've been treated to gameplay footage in the past, but there's no sign of the "total conversion mod" being made available just yet. For now, enjoy the spooks in the teaser. Admittedly two days after Halloween, but that's my bad for not spotting it sooner.


A quick reminder of what the project is


Skywind is a complete reimagining of The Elder Scrolls 3 which is being built in Bethesda's Creation Engine. In this sense, it's actually more of a Skyrim mod than a Morrowind remake, but the end result is pretty much the same thing.


The team has been working on it for quite some time. In fact, it's difficult to even pinpoint when the project officially began, but the FAQ says it's about as old as TES5.


It's probably best to also point out that while this sounds very much like Skyblivion – the unofficial remake of Oblivion done in Skyrim – the two are being helmed by different teams. If you're interested in helping out the Skyrind crew, they're always on the lookout for volunteers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starfield is closer to officially supporting Nvidia DLSS as Bethesda announced it will go into Steam Beta next week. The company stated on X (Twitter), "This update will feature Nvidia DLSS support with frame generation, display and HDR controls for supported systems, and other optimizations and improvements."


Since the update is going into Steam Beta, it means while publicly available, it's not officially out yet. Bethesda even calls for users to leave feedback so it can be polished before the full release.


Players have had access to DLSS via mods since launch, but it's nice the RPG will have official implementation. Bethesda has been progressively implementing player-requested features like a FOV slider and better Intel ARC support. DLSS just so happens to be the latest one receiving official support. 


The beta doesn't have a specific date, but its release next week means testers won't have long to wait. Hopefully, Bethesda will share more specific details about this update when it does roll out. 


For fans who would rather not use Steam Beta or have Starfield on the Microsoft store, Nukem's DLSS mod seamlessly integrated it into the RPG.

Marvelous Europe has launched what undoubtedly looks like one of the most stylish retro games on the Switch with Ninja or Die: Shadow of the Sun.
Boasting slick animation with some seriously flashy visuals, Ninja or Die is unique in that everything can be accomplished with one button press - you jump to move and jump to attack. You can charge up your jump attacks for a more devastating blow, and you'll briefly become invincible when jumping, meaning you dodge incoming attacks while landing brutal counterattacks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Larian have released a new Baldur's Gate 3 update, Patch 4, which applies 1000 fixes and changes to the indecently expansive fantasy RPG - far too many to list on Steam. The most significant additions  are accessibility settings for colour-blind people, the ability to visually customise hirelings upon recruitment, and the ability to clean up party members using sponges and soap, rather than lobbing bottles of water at them. No more rocking up to cutscenes looking like Sweeney Todd on his lunchbreak! Well, unless that's your vibe.

If the thought of a Zelda film made by Illumination has got you feeling down, this gorgeous new teaser for a project that is reimagining The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time's Castle Town as a Studio Ghibli film is a surefire way to showcase what a Hyrule-set movie has the potential to be.
We have covered the work of YouTube channel RwanLink on Nintendo Life before (you might remember the 3D animator's gorgeous renditions of Zora's Domain and Lake Hylia in Unreal Engine 5), but this latest project might just take the biscuit for things that we really, really want to see Nintendo make a reality — as unlikely as that is.

Soso's main complaint is that the gameplay feels flat at every turn. According to Soso, most missions are boring fetch quests and there's no variation in how you can approach problems. The combat is also very shallow with not much variety in terms of enemies encounters, Soso complains. 


The review also argues that exploration is boring because the galaxy is empty and the settlements are uninteresting. It also takes issue with the fact that you can't manually travel between planets, reducing much of the exploration into a matter of fast traveling.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Upcoming Survival MMO The Day Before has been delayed again, to the shock of no one. A post on the official The Day Before Twitter account confirmed that the legal battle over the right to keep the games name, and that the Store Page had been restored by Valve. But the same post also revealed that the games release had been pushed back to December 7 at 10 a.m. PT.




Another Early Access Game


The post also announced that "since this is our first huge game", the decision was made to launch The Day Before into Early Access as opposed to being a full release. Also, the price will be $39 for Early Access and then raised to $49 when the full version releases later.


I can't say I'm surprised about the delay, as we were nearing the previous release date without any recent information. However, it is a bit telling to last minute consider a game Early Access as opposed to fully releasing.


For reference, Steam has different rules for Early Access releases.



"Steam Early Access enables you to sell your game on Steam while it is still being developed, and provide context to customers that a product should be considered "unfinished." Early Access is a place for games that are in a playable alpha or beta state, are worth the current value of the playable build, and that you plan to continue to develop for release."
- Steamworks Documentation on Early Access



The Day Before is now scheduled to release on Steam on December 7.

Sonic the Hedgehog started out as a rival to Mario, but since then, the two mascots have gone on to star in a number of games together. Still, this doesn't necessarily mean the days of competition are over.
In a new Sega interview (translated by Noisypixel's Ryuji), Sega's executive director and self-confessed "Sonic lover" Osamu Ohashi mentioned how he personally wants to see Sonic "catch" Mario and surpass him in terms of popularity. He didn't hold back, either - noting how he wants the blue blur's games and movies to be "bigger" than Mario, and for him to eventually have a USJ theme park attraction.

While players might be having fun modding Thomas, Shrek and Barney the Dinosaur into its survival-horror series, Capcom has expressed concern that some mods may cause "reputational damage" to the company and their games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bandai Namco revealed the next four fighters set to join the eventual full roster of 32 when Tekken 8 releases. This brings the total revealed fighter count to 30, with the final two character reveals coming on November 2 and November 12. Fan-favorite character Devil Jin is one of the four characters revealed today, alongside Zafina, Lee Chaolan, and Alisa Bosconovitch.




Four new Fighters join Tekken 8


Devil Jin returns as the “Blank Wings of Ruin,” Jin’s demonic side coming from the devil gene in his blood and the embodiment of him living with his sins. Devil Jin’s appearance matches his name, and his fighting skills are beyond human capabilities.


The “Mystic Stargazer” Zafina brings back her unique fight style rooted in her warrior heritage and her spiritual abilities as a mystical astrologist. Her methods are as old as her lineage, using Ancient Assassination Arts in her attacks.


Lee Chaolan fights with Martial Arts, but his true power comes from the Violet Suit, a one-of-a-kind battle suit that uses sophisticated technology and unleashes attacks that reflect his “Silver haired-Demon” persona.


Alisa Bosconovitch is the “Destroying Automaton” developed by the brilliant scientist Dr. Bosconovitch. Alisa’s fighting skills come from her high-mobility flight suit and her arsenal of technological weaponry.


Tekken 8 is scheduled to release on January 26, 2024 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're the creative type, the latest Grounded update should be right up your alley (or backyard). Later this month, Obsidian Entertainment will introduce the Playgrounds mode — a creation toolset that enables players to create within the world of Grounded.


The new Playgrounds mode was introduced via the Xbox Wire today. It's a creation suite that can be compared to Halo's Forge mode or Forza Horizon 5's EventLab. 




Game director Adam Brennecke said that "this feature has been on the backlog for a very long time." The idea for Grounded's Playgrounds stems from the ingenuity of the modding community. The Grounded development team at Obsidian is relatively small, so instead of directing resources towards new content, Brennecke and the team decide to craft the Make It and Break It set of building tools that enables the game community's imagination to run wild. 


Brennecke says that the Make It and Break It is impressively malleable. Essentially everything in the game is at your disposal creatively. "We’re going to provide the tools, and someone’s going to make something magical," he said.


Players can build buildings, place furniture, create obstacles, implement creatures, and of course, larger bosses. You'll even have the ability to install specific sounds and music into specific locations and scenarios. The vast majority of Grounded's campaign assets can be utilized for creativity. It's extremely customizable, "down to individual blades of grass."


The new Make It and Break It free update will roll out for Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on November 13. In addition to Playgrounds, the update will also consist of new challenges for Burgle quests, fresh base-building assets, and combat adjustments.


Grounded is available via Xbox Game Pass and PC Game Pass. See what other big titles are headed to the subscription service soon right here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a blog post titled "The best is yet to come", developer System Era announced they will be joining Devolver Digital as a first party studio. System Era is best known for its open world survival crafting title Astroneer. At the time of this post, Astroneer has nearly 100,000 user reviews on Steam with a 92% positive score.




According to the post, Devolver Digital almost became the publisher for Astroneer years ago. Despite that not coming to fruition, the two companies stayed in touch culminating in todays acquisition.


System Era assures fans that the company, brand, and team are not going anywhere as a result of the acquisition. The company plans to continue working on Astroneer, while also working on a new project they have already started on. For Astroneer in particular, there is already a roadmap through 2024.


This is one of those situations that just makes sense. A popular indie title like Astroneer is a great fit with Devolver Digital as a publisher. I have almost 100 hours in total in Astroneer over the years, playing several times with a couple friends. I'm excited to see the new project they talked about as well...hopefully we get some more news soon!

Mafia II: Definitive Edition
This remaster of the 2010 crime game spruces up the adventure with improved HD visuals. It also includes all of its post-launch DLC. You can us take a tour of the game in this episode of New Gameplay Today.
Dragon Ball: The Breakers
This 7-v-1 multiplayer game pits a team of random normies, plus Bulma and Oolong, against a player controlling iconic Dragon Ball villains like Frieza, Cell, and Buu. The non-villains must work together to survive and escape stages in a time machine. The villain player’s job is simple: hunt and destroy everyone else. 
Aliens: Fireteam Elite
Up to four-players team up to battle hordes of xenomorphs in this cooperative class-based shooter. In our review, former editor Jason Guisao gave it a 6.5/10, writing, 
As a reminder, you have until November 6 to add October's monthly games to your library.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's hardly a surprise.
Wario's new voice actor for WarioWare: Move It! seems to have been confirmed and the answer is just as we all expected.
Yes, it looks like the new voice of Mario and Luigi, Kevin Afghani, is also voicing Wario — at least, that is the most obvious conclusion having taken a look at the game's credits. You see, much like Super Mario Bros. Wonder, Move It's credits do not list the characters alongside the voice actors, but seeing Afghani's name at the top of the list makes for a pretty obvious conclusion, if you ask us.

However, I was determined to enjoy it as much as I could. So, I broke ground on the future site of the Misery Metropolitan Area and did what I could. However, I finally hit a bump in the road I can’t drive over, so I’m hanging it up until there’s a patch.


In a Steam recent post, Mariina Hallikainen, the CEO of Colossal Order, acknowledged three major issues the Cities: Skylines II developer is looking to address. First, citizens aren’t buying all types of commercial goods, which has some commercial areas reporting that they don’t have enough consumers. That’s a relief. I’ve …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Large gaming monitors can reach some crazy-high prices - so what's to stop you from getting a smaller 4K TV instead? You get a much bigger screen for the money plus TV functionality, and if you choose carefully you won't give up PC niceties like 4K 120Hz support or  FreeSync and G-Sync compatibility. 
This leads us neatly on to the 42-inch LG C3 OLED, which has dropped to £949 at Currys in the UK for Black Friday (it's normally £1399). This tasty £450 discount brings the monitor down to a price that it actually offers better value than many large-format gaming monitors, while offering far superior HDR, incredible motion clarity and of course full compatibility with PS5 and Series X consoles.

Plus, we talk about games we've been playing recently, which includes Alan Wake 2. Alice does an unhinged rant while unaware she is once again ravaged by Covid.


This is why episode 35 is coming out a week after it was supposed to: yes, I had coronavirus the entire time! Apologies for the delay. But, you know, not like loads, I was pretty sick.

        <link href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/my-time-at-sandrock"/>
        <updated>2023-11-01T17:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not exactly the cream of the crop.
Fans of the farm sim genre have been eating well in recent times, thanks to a boom in enjoyable new releases and remakes. Heck, even Natsume's newest Harvest Moon is kind of good! Yet it was only a few years ago when Switch owners didn’t have anywhere near as many options, and it was in this period that My Time at Portia released. Offering up a jankier take on the Rune Factory approach of farm sims, it offered up a passable experience that nonetheless helped to fill an important gap in the broader library. Since that release, developer Pathea has been spending its time working on a sequel, My Time at Sandrock, which many were hoping would meaningfully improve on the flaws of the original. Unfortunately, it doesn’t really do so. My Time at Sandrock still offers up a reasonably enjoyable take on the farm sim formula, but its poor graphical presentation, litany of technical issues, and general lack of a distinct identity really drag it down.
Gameplay follows the expected trappings of a farm sim, wherein you slowly build up an impressive property via tending to crops and livestock, all while building relationships with various locals and participating in the occasional festival or gathering. Even in the desert, seasons change and you have to plan out how you time your planting and take care of your animals, even as new seasonal alternatives become available. It’s well-worn gameplay by this point, but it’s still fun to engage in. There’s something remarkably satisfying about diligently tending to your tasks every day and watching your equipment quality increase as your property gradually expands.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is perhaps ironic that in attempting to crystalise my thoughts about Alan Wake 2 - a game about a novelist with such crippling writer's block that they end up spawning an entire evil doppelganger of themselves to sabotage their own work - I, too, have been hopelessly staring at a blank screen for the better part of 24 hours. I have not, thank goodness, reached the stage where my psyche's split in two (yet), but this spiral of self-doubt has now got to the point where I simply have put words, any words, in front of one another to write my way out of this hellish pit of despair. 
Alan himself goes through a similar ordeal of writing to escape as he tries to find a way out of the prison-like dimension known as The Dark Place, where he's been trapped since the events of the first game - and I take heart from the fact that it's clearly well-worn territory for the folks at Remedy as well, such is the forensic precision in the way it's portrayed onscreen: a chaotic, supernatural tornado that not only threatens to unravel Alan's own identity, but also the wider world as we know it. It's imposter syndrome writ large, and honestly, Remedy are pretty on the money with this one. Horace is not a pretty taskmaster when the words stop coming.

Many of these take inspiration from N64 titles like Super Mario 64 and Banjo-Kazooie in various factors, echoing a time when 3D platformers were more common while remaining accessible to modern audiences. Pseudoregalia by developer rittzler is no exception to this, but that doesn't stop it from being excellent. 


Pseudoregalia follows a goat-bunny girl named Sybil as she journeys across Castle Sansa to free its prisoners. To achieve her goals, Sybil must explore its secrets, becoming more powerful along the way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thirsty Suitors is a dazzling new entry in a genre that is always badly in need of bolstering: turn-based RPGs without anime aesthetics and a story about something other than killing God. The game sees you play as Jala, who returns to her dilapidated hometown after getting dumped by the older woman for whom she abandoned college and her high school sweetheart. Waiting for her is a disappointed mother, a soon-to-be-wed sister who refuses to even speak to her, and a shadowy cabal formed of her spurned exes from the time in her life when rampant, unrelenting teen horniness nearly ripped the town apart. Jala’s journey to redemption and genuine adulthood will take her to the psychic plane to do cathartic (if overly simplistic) battle with her wronged exes, to the local skatepark to pull off some janky grinds, and to grounded emotional revelations that are rarely written this well in videogames.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Granblue Fantasy Versus fans are going to have to wait a little longer for the next entry. Cygames, Inc. announced a delay that pushes Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising to December 14, 2023. 


Rising was originally set for November 30, so the wait is just a matter of a couple weeks. According to the press release, the delay was put in place to "allow for additional fine-tuning." Cygames apologized to fans who were looking forward to diving in at the tail end of November. When it launches, the Arc System Works-developed fighter will be available for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC via Steam.

Early access action


While Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising has been delayed, that doesn't mean November will be completely bereft of battles. The second open beta test will be held from November 9 to November 12 on all three platforms. In addition to cross-platform multiplayer, the open beta will offer up access to the Grand Bruise Legends! party mode. Look for more details to be announced via the official social accounts soon. 


Early Access play will be available for those who pre-order the Deluxe Edition from the PlayStation Store. With the delay in place, the Early Access date has been shifted to December 11, with the caveat that there may be changes to the schedule between now and then. PlayStation Store pre-orders also come with a bonus PSN Avatar Set, which isn't currently planned for post-launch release in other forms. The set includes avatars for Gran, Djeeta, Siegfried, Nier, Narmaya, Beelzebub, and Seox. 


If you're itching for Granblue Fantasy Versus showdowns in the meantime, the first game is currently on sale on the PlayStation Store and Steam between now and November 8. It's currently $1.99 on the PS Store and $3.99 on Steam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel's Spider-Man 2 hit PlayStation 5 exclusively on October 20 and quickly became Sony's fastest-selling first-party game. While we loved the game – read Game Informer's Marvel's Spider-Man 2 review here – players have discovered bugs and issues leading to laughter and, in some cases, progress impediment. Fortunately, developer Insomniac Games has been quick to fix issues with updates, like one last week that fixed an incorrect flag and the infamous white cube model issue. 
Now, the studio has released another update targeting various bugs players might be encountering in the game related to specific missions, shortcuts, tutorials, and more. 


Here's the full Update Version 1.001.004 release notes: 
Addressed an issue where players could become stuck during the finale of Marko's Memories
Addressed an issue where a boss could become stuck in geometry
Addressed multiple issues where the player could become stuck during the Galvanize tutorial
Addressed an issue where players with shortcuts enabled could become stuck in a puzzle during the New Threads mission
Addressed an issue where the Charge Jump would break when assigned to a shortcut
Addressed an issue where the Upgraded Classic suit had duplicate eye details
Further addressed issues where models would not load properly after long play sessions
Improved stability 
Hopefully, if one of these issues has stopped you from progressing past certain points in Marvel's Spider-Man 2's various quests, you'll be able to advance after installing this update. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer's Marvel's Spider-Man 2 review and then read about how Insomniac updated New York City for the sequel. Then check out this story about this missing NYC landmark in the game. After that, read our guide for the best graphics mode in Marvel's Spider-Man 2, and then check out our spoiler-free tips.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gran Turismo 7 is getting its biggest update tomorrow in the form of Spec II (a.k.a update 1.40). The content drop, which is free, adds a new cooperative mode, seven new cars, a fresh track, and more.


Perhaps the update’s biggest addition is four-player local split-screen. Unfortunately for PS4 players, this option is only available on PS5. Speaking of PS5-only features, those players can enjoy taking on Gran Turismo Sophy, which developer Polyphony Digital describes as a “prototype revolutionary racing AI agent” 
Spec II also adds the snowy Lake Louise track. Set in a Canadian ski resort, it comes in three variants: long track, short track, and tri-oval. New Master License events are coming and the update also adds quality-of-life features, such as a dashboard that tracks player progression.
Of course, new vehicles are always exciting, and here are the seven joining the roster:
Dodge Charger R/T 426 Hemi '68
Dodge Challenger SRT Demon '18
Lexus LFA '10
Mercedes-Benz 190 E 2.5-16 Evolution II '91
NISMO 400R '95
Porsche 911 GT3 RS (992) '22
Tesla Model 3 Performance '23
Spec II adds a host of smaller additions, such as new Cafe menus and new photo mode options, and you can read a complete breakdown by reading the blog post on the Gran Turismo website. You can download the update on November 2. For more on Gran Turismo 7, check out our review.]]></summary>

Ever since its first title 20 years ago, the WarioWare franchise has shapeshifted to take advantage of the capabilities and gimmicks of whatever the current Nintendo platform was. But the first entry on Switch, Get It Together, bucked that trend, putting you in control of the actual cast of characters in platforming-style microgames instead of taking advantage of the Switch’s unique traits. WarioWare: Move It aligns more with the traditional WarioWare experience, resulting in a better overall collection.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega has unveiled Sonic Dream Team, a new 3D action-platformer launching exclusively on December 5 on Apple Arcade. With it launching on Apple Arcade, you'll need to subscribe to the iOS-based gaming subscription service, which costs $6.99 a month. Dr. Eggman has discovered The Reverie, a special ancient device that can manifest dreams in the real world, and it's up to Sonic the Hedgehog and friends to stop him from doing so. Players must navigate "twisted dreamscapes, rescue your friends, and put a stop to Dr. Eggman's nightmarish dreams of world domination." 
Sonic Dream Team features six playable characters in Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Amy Rose, Cream, and Rouge, and Sega says each character brings their own flair and personality alongside three movement types "that provide unique exploration opportunities while navigating the dream world." It also features four boss battles, never-before-seen worlds spread across "four unique dream worlds with mind-bending environments that include wall-running, gravity changes, and more." Plus, Sonic Dream Team can be played on iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV. 
Check out the Sonic Dream Team reveal trailer for yourself below:

The most ghoulish of Amnesia's many ghoulish ideas is "vitae". It's a luminous, blue-green fluid that can be used as an energy source, a chemical catalyst and a supernatural healing agent. Each Amnesia game is broadly a story about the production of vitae, with some levels consisting of huge distillation and refining apparata, and major plot developments tied to what you do with it. In the original Amnesia: The Dark Descent, you'll brew potions using vitae in order to keep a decapitated head alive. In 2020's Amnesia: Rebirth, you'll use ornate metal cannisters of the stuff like batteries to power otherworldly machines. Vitae is the blood and breath of Amnesia, the grease upon the narrative axels, the fuel in its boiler, the miracle McGuffin that sustains its nastier flights of fantasy. But what is vitae, exactly? Agony.

Mind you, it appears the associated functionality was secretly part of Bethesda's sci-fi RPG all along, perhaps destined to be unlocked by a DLC pack, like a slumbering fairytale royal awaiting true love's kiss.
The modder in question is vexthecollector, whose catchily-named Spacestations for Outposts lets you bolt together hab modules, windows and docking bays to fashion your very own Deep Space Nine. Sadly for my character, the acutely terra-phobic star pirate Mary Read, you'll need to first build an outpost on a planet in order to access the goods.

But I'm a brave boy, so I dropped in, and of course died almost instantly. Sekiro is still one of the toughest soulslikes around, absolutely filled with extremely dangerous bosses and twisted body-horror monstrosities that can carve you up with just a couple of hits, sending you back to the last checkpoint bereft of all your XP. But the Headless scares me so much, I actively avoid facing it until I have absolutely no choice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jusant is all show, no tell, which is a bold swing. Video game characters aren't often big on show don't tell in 2023. A lot of them have been cursed by their creators to narrate everything they do, as they do it, incase the meatsacks controlling them are unable to parse even one second of what is happening on screen without direction. I love HZD's Aloy, but does she ever just stream-of-consciousness her way through life.
In contrast, the nameless protagonist in Don't Nod's new climbing puzzle adventure (what even are genres?) is also silent. There are no other NPCs. You are climbing up through the ruins of an old civilisation. As such, Jusant relies on the devs having crafted an understandable world that you can barely interact with, aside from painstakingly climbing across it like a spidery archaeologist. You've got to have faith in your environmental storytelling if you're making a game like that. And Don't Nod have nailed it.

Jusant asks players to do one thing: climb. As a silent mountaineer accompanied by a cute critter, the only thing standing between you and your mysterious mission is one very tall mountain. The journey to its summit is treacherous, but thanks to an ingenious climbing system, beautiful art direction, and intriguing world-building, inching toward the top is worth the effort. 
The intuitive climbing mechanics are the star of the show. Pressing the left and right shoulder buttons lets you grip handholds with the correspond…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A little knowledge can be worse than no knowledge at all. I know a little about the Yakuza series, having reviewed the 1980s-set Yakuza Zero for this very parish in 2018, and tried a bit of 2019's turn-based battler Yakuza: Like A Dragon. Fast-forward to 2023, and all Yakuza games are now Like A Dragon games, including the forthcoming Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, which is an... Animal Crossing game, actually? With skateboarding? I'm still getting my head around the existence of a zombie spin-off, Dead Souls, to say nothing of the samurai-era Like A Dragon: Ishin. And then there's the inter-quel Like a Dragon Gaiden, due this November, which seems like a relatively straight-laced delve into the past of original protagonist Kazuma Kiryu. Phew, it's just as well Ed Thorn wrote that guide to the order you should play the Yakuza games in.


It sounds like the developers at Ryu ga Gotoku Studio have a hard time keeping track themselves, especially given the rate at which Sega publish Like A Dragon games. According to studio director Masayoshi Yokoyama, Like A Dragon's creators feel a lot of pressure to get the games done quickly, not just with a view to making money but because as projects that riff so copiously on pop culture, Like A Dragon stories go out of date fast.

And yet! That's a large part of what I enjoy about the new subterranean survival-craft-'em-up The Lord Of The Rings: Return To Moria. It's a slower, more weighty survival game than you might be used to if you're a Valheim or ARK type, for example, and you'll spend a lot of your time in the dark. But what is this, a survival game for elves? No sir. And besides, like I said, it's rather sweet. Cosy, even.

Atari states that Digital Eclipse benefits by gaining access to “world-class IP” to grow its business and development capabilities further.

Ahead of the premiere (release? Launch?) of the experimental Silent Hill Ascension tonight, we had a chance to speak with the developer Genvid about the game (TV show? Crowd-directed narrative?) is, what it will mean to the Silent Hill universe, and how much work is going into animating the versions of the narrative that may never be seen.
Calling Ascension a video game is almost a misnomer. There is an interactive element, but you won’t be holding a controller in your hand pushing characters to make decisions in the traditional sense. Instead, viewers will download the Silent Hill Ascension app on mobile devices or PC (there is a PlayStation option, but only for viewing episodes, not participating)…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've only just read Sin's thoughts on Akuma Kira's Lunacid and lo and behold, the PS1-styled, first-person dungeon crawler has now released out of Steam Early Access, to considerable rejoicing. Lunacid is a homage to classic FromSoftware games - no, not that juvenile upstart Dark Souls, but King's Field and Shadow's Tower, which date back to the late 1990s. 


I played one of the King's Field games as a sprog and found it to be an extended cave system full of lava, demons and torment. Lunacid sort of applies the perspective and medieval fantasy combat of that series to a story reminiscent of Demon's Souls - the From-alike that spurred the Japanese studio to international fame - with a world that has been flooded with toxic mist by a "sleeping old one below". Your job, as some unfortunate outcast chucked into a pit, is to journey downward and confront this mysterious creature, using any and all combinations of rapiers, clubs and fireballs. Off you go then.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer Toby Fox followed up their 2015 critically acclaimed and fan-favorite 2D RPG Undertale with Deltarune Chapter 1 in 2018. This chapter was the first in what we'd later learn is a five-chapter top-down RPG with puzzles, bullet hell sequences, and Final Fantasy-inspired combat, and Chapter 1 was released for free. Fox dropped Chapter 2 in 2021 in a surprise announcement, and now, players patiently await the release of Chapter 3. Today, more than two years later, Fox has revealed an updated plan for their Deltarune release strategy. 


With Chapter 3 nearing completion, Fox plans to finish Chapter 4 and release Deltarune as a purchaseable product. And following that, development on Chapter 5 will continue and hit the game when it's ready. To help with this, Fox has hired a producer "whose entire job it will be to speed up the overall game development for future chapters," according to a new statement released. 
You can read Fox's full statement below: 
Elsewhere in the update, Fox says Chapter 3 took a lot of trial and error to figure out how it would work but that with Chapter 4, "I already feel very confident about how we can progress." They also note that people on the team are already transitioning back into working on Chapter 4 and that everybody is excited to work on that part of Deltarune. 
For more about the game, watch the original Deltarune teaser and then check out this Chapter 2 teaser. After that, read Game Informer's Undertale review. 
Are you going to purchase Deltarune with the release of Chapter 4? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

These include the modestly-known about Control 2, a sequel to the paranormal Brutalist telekinet 'em up that is seeing "good progress", and the forthcoming remakes of Max Payne 1 and 2, on which Remedy are collaborating with GTA and Max Payne 3 developer Rockstar.
Further afield, there's the mysterious Condor project, a co-op multiplayer Control spin-off (pictured above) that builds on Remedy's experience crafting the single-player component for wayward service-based shooter CrossfireX. And at the very edge of sight, there's the faint outline of something called Codename Vanguard, about which naff-all is known. Could it be that "crazy, huge budget, dark gothic fantasy" Remedy's creative director Sam Lake would like one day to make?

Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is the next canonical chapter of the Avatar mythos. Set during the one-year gap in Avatar: The Way of Water on the other side of Pandora in a new area called the Western Frontier, players control a Na’vi raised and trained by the Resources Development Administration (RDA) who finds themselves taking the fight to the corporation. That requires, quite literally, getting back to their roots as they reconnect with Eywa while learning what it means to be a Na’vi by ingratiating themselves with the game’s three new clans.

IGN and Bloomberg have learned new information about the layoffs that occurred at Destiny 2 maker Bungie this week, including that roughly 100 employees were laid off from the company. As for why, IGN's sources report that during an employee meeting after the layoffs, Bungie CEO Pete Parsons told staff that the layoffs were due to the underperformance of Destiny 2 over the last year as well as "lower-than-expected preorders" for the upcoming expansion, The Final Shape. 
Employees were reportedly told that Destiny 2 player sentiment had reached an all-time-low and IGN's sources say employees at the studio have attempted to discuss this with Bungie leadership, asking to make the necessary changes, presumably to get player sentiment back up.

If you preorder a digital version of the game, you can play through its campaign early, starting November 2. That's eight days before the full game's release on November 10, which is when its multiplayer suite goes live. Ahead of that early campaign launch, publisher Activision Blizzard has released the PC specs and system requirements to play Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III. 
If you've played recent Call of Duty entries, you likely already know what you're in for, and this year's is not all that different. But if you're new, or curious if you need to upgrade before this year's entry, we've got you covered.

Speaking to me in an interview about Hunt's evolution since its launch out of early access in 2019, the game's general manager David Fifield observed that while Crytek may yet make another Hunt game it won't be a straight Showdown follow-up - and it certainly won't come at the expense of your ability to play the original game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in June, when our Ed got a 30-minute hands-off glimpse of Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora, he had suspicions that Ubisoft's next big open world-athon was hiding some dark, terrible secret beneath the surface. It was almost too good, and too lovely-looking to be completely true, he proposed, and the brief tour of this rather enormous-looking game wasn't quite long enough to really dig beneath the surface to see if Ubisoft's lofty promises would hold up to closer scrutiny. 
Now, just over a month from release, I've finally been able to put it under a proper microscope, playing two hours of the thing from around the 25% mark of its campaign. And it really is as visually impressive as Ed suggested all those months ago. At long last, this is a game that looks and feels like an actual "next-gen" blockbuster (or as much as a game can, at least, when we're already several years into the current generation cycle). But Ed was also right to feel a wee bit suspicious of Frontiers Of Pandora. Perhaps not in the way he expected, but enough that I heard the same thing being muttered over and over again by almost everyone at the end of my preview session at Ubisoft's UK offices: "I can't work out where the heck I'm meant to be going, or what I'm supposed to do."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Square Enix revealed Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link, a new GPS-based action RPG for iOS and Android devices, last year as part of its 20th Anniversary celebration, which is also where the company revealed Kingdom Hearts IV. Now, Square Enix has released a new teaser trailer for Missing-Link alongside the reveal it will launch sometime next year. 
In the teaser trailer, we see someone who is presumably the game's protagonist in Scala ad Caelum, a special metropolis that those who have completed Kingdom Hearts III will recognize. The teaser showcases the RPG's combat as well, which seems like a mix between some of the mechanics in Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories and standard mobile action RPG gameplay. We also see some of the Disney characters in the game, including Ariel from The Little Mermaid, Simba from The Lion King, and Baymax from Big Hero 6, to name a few. 
Check out the Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link teaser trailer for yourself below: 


Square Enix says it is now recruiting testers from the U.K. and Australia for a closed Missing-Link beta test, and if eligible, you can apply here.
Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link is due out on iOS and Android in 2024. 
For more, watch the original Missing-Link reveal trailer and then watch the Kingdom Hearts IV reveal trailer. Check out this Sora Amiibo coming out next year after that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apologies to the chief, but there’s a not-entirely-accurate bit in Katharine’s post announcing Starfield as October’s RPS Game Club game. I, of the RPS Treehouse, do truly love Starfield, and have only been quiet about it because admitting you enjoy The Grey Bethesda Game but couldn’t get into Baldur's Gate 3 or Elden Ring feels a bit like going to the Savoy Grill and only ordering chips. No one will ask you to leave, but they’ll probably start questioning your judgement.
But dammit, I like chips, and I like Starfield! I like its roving space captain fantasy, I like its utilitarian aesthetic, and I like how its click-clacking guns sound like extremely violent mechanical keyboards. Especially if I get to fire them at floating pirates, while I’m also floating, and said firing punts me upwards into a ceiling.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some people sing the praises of "visceral" games. Others extol the virtues of "immersive" games. Me, I'm increasingly drawn to "perverse" games. No, not like that. Well, not entirely like that. I mean "perverse" more straightforwardly as in deliberately awkward and unreceptive in their core design, almost self-defeating in a way that has you saying "WTF?" and hankering to know more.
Take The Great Below, a new horror... thingmabob from Cantabria-based Dobra Studios. It's about exploring a strange house full of dreadful paintings in the dark. It's a 3D game with keyboard move-look controls, but the twist is that you can only move around while looking at a 2D map, with your position marked as a pair of footprints.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When was the last time you played a good 3D character platformer? For me, it was probably Psychonauts 2. But before that? Outside of Mario? I'm not sure I'd be able to tell you. For whatever reason, the 3D character platformer has become an increasingly rare breed, it would seem, which makes them even more heartening to see when they do occasionally poke their head above the parapet and leap onto our screens. Song Of Nunu: A League Of Legends Story is one of them, channelling the joyous, boundless enthusiasm of its late 90s and early 00s predecessors to create a simple, but straightforward adventure that you could just as easily enjoy alone as an adult, or with a child in tow. It did not, alas, quite make me cry as developers Tequila Works intended (that honour still belongs to Rime and Rime alone out of their back catalogue), but there's much to admire here while having your heartstrings lightly plucked at the same time. And you don't need to know a jot about League Of Legends to enjoy it.

        <updated>2023-10-27T22:35:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since Insomanic revealed its Wolverine game two years ago, fans have wondered if it’s set in the same universe as the studio’s Spider-Man games. In an interview with Kinda Funny, Spider-Man 2 director Bryan Intihar confirmed the answer is yes
When host Greg Miller asked if it had been previously confirmed or denied whether or not their spin on Wolverine shared the same Earth as its Spider-Men, Intihar replied by saying, “They’re all 1048. I think I got that right, but yeah.” Inthiar is referring to Earth-1048, which is the designation for the Marvel universe Insonmiac’s superhero games occupy.
You can watch the clip beginning at the 1:10:44 mark (thanks IGN). 


Whether or not that means we’ll see any Spider-Man references in Wolverine, which does not have a release window, remains to be seen, but that’s exciting news regardless. Marvel’s Spider-Man’s New York City is chock full of references to other heroes, such as Avengers Tower, the Sanctum Sanctorum, and the Wakandan Embassy, so it made more sense to imagine Logan doing his thing somewhere out there.
Beyond this update, we know little about Wolverine other than that it will be a mature-rated title exclusive to the PlayStation 5. As we wait to learn more details, you can read this opinion piece on why I'd like to see the two game series share the same universe.]]></summary>

A target appears on your back when you’re a long-reigning champ. No longer the enigma you once were, contenders begin studying your body of work to figure out the path to ending your time at the top. The best way to fend off would-be challengers is to continually build and evolve. Developer EA Vancouver seems to understand this because while no legitimate contenders have emerged in the mixed-martial-arts genre, EA Sports UFC 5 retools several key areas to show the franchise isn’t resting on its laurels.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new gameplay video for Little Nightmares III offers a lengthy look at its two-player cooperative gameplay. Like the previous games, this third outing looks every bit as moody and unsettling. 
This pre-alpha footage shows playable characters, Low and Alone, exploring The Necropolis, a desert-like zone, working together to overcome its many obstacles. For example, when attacked by flying beetles, one shoots them down with a bow while the other smashes the downed targets with a wrench. The kids’ biggest threat, at least in this slice, comes in the form of a giant, rampaging doll aptly known as "Monster Baby". It’s supremely creepy, and you can see for yourself below.


Unlike the first two games, which were developed by Tarsier Studios, Little Nightmares III is being made by Supermassive Games, makers of Until Dawn and The Dark Pictures Anthology. It’s scheduled to launch next year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you love The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker but wish it had more blood, death and inclement weather in it, consider Sands of Aura. Released out of early access today, this is a top-down fantasy action-RPG set in a swirling, post-apocalyptic world in which you build up a town and sail between island dungeons in a sandship.
The sandship, or rather, "grainwake" sailing sees you bouncing merrily from dunes as vast, ominous structures loom out of the haze. The combat takes some inspiration from the Souls games, but the top-down perspective makes it feel like a classic arcade action title. Boss battles involve dodging or parrying colourful streaks, waves and clusters of projectiles. The developers, 12-person Chashu Entertainment, say it's a difficult experience. It looks it.

Spider-Man sees the friendly neighborhood hero battle a star-studded gallery of villains in an original adventure chock full of comic book goodness. As Spider-Man's first fully 3D action-adventure game, it laid the groundwork for mechanics such as web-swinging, a variety of web shooter attacks, and wall-crawling stealth gameplay. Let's see how it holds up 23 years later.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After spending hours poring over Alan Wake 2 this week, corkboards full of photos, red string and important little clue nuggets have definitely been on my brain. Alas, Remedy's horror-fuelled detective 'em up keeps its problem-solving a little too much at arm's length for my tastes. Every piece of evidence you collect has its own set place on the board, for example, and heck, even the thrill of joining the dots with a set of pins and string is taken away from you, as its deduction work is all swept up in a wave of automation. 
Happily, other developers are stepping in to fill that string-based gap, and chief among them is the French-made Chronique Des Silencieux, whose Steam demo I played over lunch today. You play as a rookie detective in this charming point and click game, and your entire raison d'etre is to point out contradictions Phoenix Wright-style between testimonies you gather and the evidence you accumulate. Only instead of shouting, "Objection!" you do it by manually sticking pins and red string between the offending bits of information. It's delightful, and well worth a nose if old Alan leaves you wanting this weekend.

RE Engine's successor, the REX engine, is a response to three things - 1) RE Engine productions getting bigger in terms of assets, and more diverse in terms of genre, 2) RE Engine games being increasingly made by overseas developers who speak different languages, and 3) unflattering comparisons with various commercial tools, like Unreal Engine and Unity.

In Free Range Games's plucky dungeon sim The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria, you're a dwarf trying to reclaim the once-proud undercity of Khazad-dûm, tunnelling between procedurally generated networks of halls and crafting your own havens and upgrade facilities from long-wrecked forges and mansions. 


 The game is set after Sauron's defeat at the end of The Return of the King novel (spoilers, I guess?), at a time in Middle-earth canon when most of the big names were busy shaking hands and doling out promotions, but there are still plenty of orcs, trolls and other threats to worry about in Moria. Right now, though, the real headache is that I can't make my base of operations symmetrical.

(Well, the real gift would be re-printing the fabled Final Fantasy X-2 Piano Collections CD and/or sticking that online as well, if you ask me, but hey, I'll allow them this one little omission). 
After all, there's an absolute treasure trove of music you lucky lot get to dig into now, so if you're wondering where to start or just fancy yet another guided tour through some of Final Fantasy's best music tracks, allow me to forcibly volunteer myself to regale you with some of my personal favourite highlights.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The psychiatrist Viktor E. Frankl posited that humans are motivated, above almost all else, to search for meaning in their lives. He would probably be unsurprised, if more than slightly confused, to see that spirit manifest in a rumour that the rubbish performance of Cities: Skylines 2 is being caused by excessive teeth.


A widely-shared reddit post suggests that rendering the highly detailed chompers of Skylines 2’s citizenry, who lack the LOD (level of detail) implementation that would reduce their model quality at a distance, is a major cause behind the game’s inability to pump out frames per second. Developers Colossal Order disagree, and have put out a statement denying this "bizarre story."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After weeks of in-game teases and more, Epic Games has officially confirmed that the next season of Fortnite will bring players back to Chapter 1. With Fortnite loading screens hiding secret dates that point to Chapter 1: Season 5 and props from that season landing on this current season's map, players have remain convinced that the next season, Chapter 4: Season 5 will actually bring everyone back to an older chapter of Fortnite; now we know it's happening. 
Today's reveal comes by way of the official Fortnite Twitter account, which posted, "Sprint (or Mantle, your choice) back to Chapter 1...see you soon 11.3.2023 #FortniteOG" with an image of the Fortnite battle bus.

October 27, 2023
As you can see, the above Tweet confirms what many have been speculating: Fortnite is going back to its Chapter 1 roots. And while not officially confirmed, it's likely the Chapter 4: Season 5 map will have some Chapter 1: Season 5 integration on it based on teases over the past few weeks. 
Fortnite Chapter 4: Season 5 launches November 3. 
For more about the current chapter, read our summary of everything you need to know about Fortnite Chapter 4: Season 4, and then read about how you can relive the events of Alan Wake in Fortnite ahead of Alan Wake 2, which is out today.

        <updated>2023-10-27T12:49:09.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year, Atari announced that it acquired Berzerk, its sequel Frenzy, and 10 other classic arcade properties. Then, earlier this month, Atari revealed Berzerk: Recharged, the first Berzerk game since the original 1980s arcade game. At the time, the company said it was coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC, and now we know exactly when: November 9. 
"On November 9, Evil Otto once again invites you to his maze of maniacal chaos in the newly reimagined Berzerk: Recharged," an Atari press release reads. "The latest entry in Atari's acclaimed Recharged series, Berzerk: Recharged will have you almost begging for mercy as you face off against Otto's droves of robotic menaces, all while the grinning incarnation of evil draws ever nearer." 
Alongside this release date news, Atari has released some additional Berzerk: Recharged screenshots you can check out below: 

For more about the game, including details about what to expect, read Game Informer's prior Berzerk: Recharged coverage here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday was a great day for fans of the most emo Batman in the Caped Crusader's cinematic history because Robert Pattinson's suit from The Batman was seemingly added to Batman: Arkham Knight. But the fun was fleeting because just a few hours later, the suit was removed.
Strangely, the suit, which first appeared in director Matt Reeve's 2022 The Batman, was only available in the Epic Games Store version of Arkham Knight, as noticed by GeekVibesNation on Twitter and verified by GameSpot; Game Informer was not able to check the game for the suit before it was removed.

At first, fans thought the suit was a well-made mod making the rounds online before more and more people realized it was actually added. As for why it was added, nobody knows, but Game Informer reached out to Warner Bros. Games to ask about the suit and will update this story if we learn more. 
The Batman suit joins a plethora of other movie suits already in Arkham Knight, like Michael Keaton's from the 1989 film, Batman, or Christian Bale's from The Dark Knight. Here's hoping The Batman suit returns soon because if screenshots players have captured are any indication, it fits right in with the dark Gotham of Arkham Knight. 
While we all wait to learn more, read Game Informer's reviews of Arkham Asylum, Arkham City, and Arkham Knight. After that, read Game Informer's Batman: Arkham Origins review, which is a game that just celebrated its 10-year anniversary this week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You can probably guess what’s coming. Alan Wake 2’s PC performance has been the subject of nervous uh oh-ing since well before the release of its onerous system requirements; Remedy comms director Thomas Puha even implored players to "look at the image quality" instead of framerates, like Dean Learner exalting the storytelling of Punch of Judy.
Actually, that’s not fair. Alan Wake 2 is much more enjoyable than Punch and Judy. And, like Remedyverse predecessor Control, there is something impressive about just how much visual tech you can choose to put on show: ray tracing, path tracing, Nvidia Ray Reconstruction, frame generation via DLSS 3, the lot. This wealth of options has produced the most intricate settings guides I’ve put together in ages, and you can consult it yourself lower down this page.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crytek's Hunt: Showdown may yet receive a single-player campaign, if the stars align, as the developers dig ever deeper into the asymmetrical multiplayer shooter's wonderfully plague-ridden narrative backdrop. Originally released out of Steam and Xbox early access in 2019, the game introduced single player PvE trials back in June 2020, much to Alice0's enthusiasm. It also now sports a scripted, voiced tutorial in which you stalk around farmhouses, learning the ropes and murdering wooden dummies at the behest of a leathery dude in the bushes. Could some kind of proper story component follow? Crytek have certainly thought about it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You haven't even downloaded Remedy's Alan Wake 2 yet, assuming you're planning to, which means it's already time to start thinking about what you'll do once you've finished it. Apologies, the news beat is a cruel mistress and the present is always past, but in my defence, jumping irresponsibly around the timeline does make sense for a supernatural horror game that follows two characters through different dimensions.
Remedy's plans for the game include a chunky New Game+ mode, aka "Final Draft", which will hopefully arrive in late November, and two DLC packs, Night Springs and The Lake House. The first concerns Alan Wake's fictional in-game TV show, a homage to the Twilight Zone, while the second involves "an independent government organization" that can surely only be the Federal Bureau of Control.

The list below outlines a handful of characters worth remembering before diving into the ocean that’s not a lake.
I fully acknowledge that simply being reminded of a character with the knowledge that they will be relevant to the sequel could be conceived as a spoiler. Some of the characters below appear in person, some only in passing in documents, but they are the ones that forced me to pause the game and do a quick Google.

But since the long-awaited sequel has been tossed around for over a decade, it's fair to assume not everyone has a clear memory of the events of the first game, and some people likely never got around to playing it at all. If that sounds like you, you're in the right place; here's everything you need to know about the first Alan Wake to prepare for the sequel.
Arriving at Bright Falls
The game takes place in the town of Bright Falls, Washington, where the titular protagonist Alan Wake is going on vacation with his wife, Alice. Wake is an author known for his Alex Casey novels, but he hasn't written anything new in three years. After being recognized in town several times by fans (especially Rose, the waitress at a local diner), Wake receives keys…]]></summary>

A major free update is out today, Naval Warfare, which as the name suggets brings that persistent online war to the sea, with gunboats, destroyers and beach landings to contend with.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft's multiplayer Jolly Rog 'em up Skull and Bones is caught on the reefs once again. Recently tipped to appear in early fiscal year 2023-2024, it's now due to make landfall in the publisher's FYQ4 - sometime between January and March 2024. What's the Golden Age of Piracy equivalent for "vapourware"? I'm picturing a spectral vessel like the Flying Dutchman, crewed by glum-faced producers and with a big grimacing statue of company CEO Yves Guillemot affixed to the prow.


The troubled naval combat sim isn't the only Ubisoft project experiencing misadventures. As revealed in their latest earnings report, the publisher have also pushed back a mysterious "large game", originally due to launch before the end of their current fiscal year, to the next fiscal year, which means at some point after 31st March 2024. Speculation runs rife that the anonymous blockbuster is Ubisoft Massive's Star Wars Outlaws.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel's Spider-Man 2 hit PlayStation 5 exclusively last week and it's already Sony's fastest-selling first-party game. While we loved the game – read Game Informer's Marvel's Spider-Man 2 here – once players got their hands on the game, some encountered a few bugs and issues, like one where their character model became a small white cube that looks like tofu. Plus, players discovered a Cuban flag was displayed inside and outside the Morales household rather than the expected Puerto Rican flag. A new update for Marvel's Spider-Man 2 out today fixes both of these issues and more. 


Version 1.001.003 is now live in-game, and it brings a few fixes to the game, including the aforementioned flag issue and white cube issue. It also addresses an issue where The Amazing 2 Suit's spider logo appeared too bright in-game, and improves the game's stability. Here's the full update breakdown: 
Addressed an issue where an incorrect flag was displayed
Addressed an issue where models would not load properly after long play sessions
Addressed an issue where The Amazing 2 Suit's Spider logo appeared too bright
Improved stability
Developer Insomniac Games has also released a statement alongside the above patch notes specifically addressing the flag issue. 
"Today's patch corrects an error where the Cuban flag was incorrectly displayed instead of the Puerto Rican flag," it reads. "We understand that accurate representation matters, and greatly regret this error. We sincerely apologize and will do better in the future." 


Marvel's Spider-Man 2 hit PlayStation 5 exclusively on October 20.

With that in mind, today's questions come courtesy of caff, who asked: What is your favourite biscuit? and PolygonClassicist, who asked: What are the caffeine habits of the RPS staff? (along with the extra sub-question clarifications of: when do we like to have our coffee, espresso, tea, soda and/or energy drinks? How do we like to consume them?

Its release this week comes after developer Remedy Entertainment delayed the game 10 days earlier this summer. While there are plenty of visual options for players playing on PC – check out Alan Wake 2's PC spec requirements here – there are only two graphics modes for those picking it up on PS5 and Xbox Series X (and just one on Xbox Series S). But first, be sure to read Game Informer's Alan Wake 2 review.  
Below, we'll dive into the two graphics modes for Alan Wake 2 on PS5 and Xbox Series X, and then a handful of Game Informer editors playing the game will share the mode they've opted to experience Remedy's latest in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[OK, so there's plenty in Worldless that won't remind you of Silksong or its predecessor, Hollow Knight. Rather than a medieval bug exploring a labyrinth of bioluminescent rot and lore, you're a vaguely humanoid cloud of shards and points, roaming an abstract landscape of soft curves and shafts of light. You're Rayman but fancy, basically, and the world is no world but an uncreated expanse of elemental forces, though you'll find you can run and jump on it much as you can the ledges of Hallownest. The combat is a different beast, too. Rather than Souls-inflected 2D hack-and-slash, it's turn-based battling with a twist - each turn gives you a countdown in which to perform real-time combos, mixing melee and magical attacks. 


So why does Worldless make me think of Team Cherry's work? Partly it's the underlying touch of metroidvania, a word the press materials seem oddly hesitant to use. The map extends in all directions and you'll need to acquire new abilities to reach certain areas. Partly, it's the shared enchanted grotto atmosphere, with all sorts of tiny animate details festering for attention as you explore. And partly, it's the dash move you unlock early on, and the process of chaining it with a platform-conjuring ability to unlock routes while traversing them, which puts me strongly in mind of those horizontal gauntlet runs from the Silksong trailer. All told, if you're beginning to crisp up for lack of Hollow Knight news, you might want to give the demo a whirl ahead of Worldless's release on (drum roll) 21st November 2023.

Remedy is known for being experimental. It mixes live-action footage into its video games, plays with player expectations, rewards those devoted to the developer’s history and gameography, and in the case of Alan Wake 2, eagerly performs big-budget lunacy for our entertainment and sometimes confusion. The highs of Alan Wake’s follow-up adventure are tall, but there are frequent lows that drag the whole experience into The Dark Place.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Alan Wake 2 review embargo lifts today, but ours needs a bit more time in the oven. Review code only came in late Sunday night, and for a game so heavily reliant on the thrust and resolution of its story, it's imperative I get to the end of it before I deliver my final verdict. Alas, the business of running a website does not play nicely with tight review deadlines like this, but what I can tell you after 15-odd hours of play is that it's really sunk its claws into me good and proper. 
Alan Wake 2 is a much creepier, more unnerving kind of horror game than its predecessor, doubling down on its fiction-meets-reality schtick while also piling on the scares and interlacing it with unsettling imagery of teeth-gnashing, inkblot-stained doppelgangers to ratchet up the tension. In many ways, this is a game that owes as much to Resident Evil 7 as it does its own lineage in the genre, and the dual narratives of its two protagonists, FBI agent Saga Anderson and Alan himself, arguably make this Remedy's most sophisticated tale yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this week, Microsoft revealed the launch of Starfield led to a 13% increase in overall Xbox content and services revenue in its Fiscal Year 2024 Quarter 1 financials. Now, Capcom has released its latest round of financials – the six-month period that ended in September – and in it, reveals that both income and profit are up thanks to the excellent launches of its Resident Evil 4 remake and Street Fighter 6. 
Total game sales are up from 21.3 million this time last year to 22.6 million units, resulting in a net sales increase of 53%, from 49,067 million Yen to 74,934 million Yen. Operating income is up 55%, too. As for why, Capcom points to the release of its Resident Evil 4 remake, which it released back in March, Street Fighter 6, which hits PlayStation, Xbox, and PC in June, and its Monster Hunter series.

After the wait was extended by a 10-day delay, the game's release is almost here. After getting a new launch trailer yesterday that showed more of this spooky world, developer Remedy Entertainment has another pre-launch update to share: New Game+ will arrive sometime after the game's launch. 
This New Game+ mode will allow players to retain all unlocked weapons and upgrades. Plus, it will feature a new Nightmare difficulty level and an "alternative narrative" that includes new manuscript pages and new video content. Remedy says it's due sometime after launch but that the release timing of it is still to be decided.

The game in question is, of course, Still Wakes The Deep from Dear Esther and Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs developer The Chinese Room. Set off the coast of Scotland in the 1970s, it sees you navigating collapsing gantries and flooded rooms while avoiding an unearthly terror apparently extracted from the ocean floor. Mind you, the worst thing in the game could be the weather, which you can witness for yourself in the latest gameplay trailer below. Never mind the dreadful moaning on the other side of the pipes - how about that drizzle?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At EGX earlier this month, climate change protestors cosplaying as the Ghostbusters interrupted a Tekken 7 tournament, spraying player screens with orange paint and attempting to make a speech before being hauled off by security. The three protestors, who were later arrested, are members of Just Stop Oil, a British activist group officially founded in February 2022 who carry out acts of nonviolent obstruction and vandalism in the hope of rallying support against the UK government granting new fossil fuel licenses and production agreements. In the case of EGX, which is run by Rock Paper Shotgun's parent company Reedpop, Just Stop Oil were protesting against the sponsorship of one EGX stage by Barclays Bank, who have financed billions of dollars of fossil fuel investments (Barclays have provided some official comment down the page). They were also trying to call attention to oil giant Shell's sponsorship deal with Fortnite, which includes a special themed map "powered by Shell V-Power(r) NiTRO+ Premium Gasoline".
I've written a bit here and there about the overlap between games, video games and protest movements. I've also been on a JSO protest march myself - albeit, slightly by accident (no, I didn't glue myself to anything). I was curious to hear more about the EGX protest, and specifically, whether the group's tactical use of cosplay for both dramatic effect and subterfuge represents any broader understanding of games as a form of protest art. JSO put me in touch with Oliver Clegg, a 20-year-old student who joined the group early on and has participated in some of their better-known direct actions. The below is a transcript of that conversation which has been edited down for length and clarity.

The post-credits sequence of Iron Man served as a teaser for what was to come, as Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury informed Stark that he was a part of a bigger universe.

It hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC this Friday, on October 27, after developer Remedy Entertainment delayed it 10 days earlier this summer. With just two days until launch, Remedy released the Alan Wake 2 launch trailer during today's Xbox Partner Preview, which is where we also saw our first gameplay from Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and Ikaro: Will Not Die, the new game from the makers of Powerwash Simulator. 
In the trailer, we see dual protagonists Saga Anderson and the titular Alan Wake come to grips with the latter's ability to influence the real world with words written on his typewriter. Like the game, this trailer mixes Alan Wake 2's live-action elements with gameplay, and both look great. The gameplay continues to deliver the spooky action thrills previously seen in other trailers, and we get a new glimpse of the game's story. 
Check out the Alan Wake 2 launch trailer for yourself below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’ve been curious about The Finals, Embark Studios’ game show-inspired free-to-play shooter, you can sample a taste of the game in an open beta starting tomorrow. First revealed last August, the game has only been playable in closed playtests over the last year. 
A new trailer premiering during today’s Xbox Partner Preview shows off the first-person shooter, in which teams compete in virtual arenas for the delight of a cheering audience (and potential sponsors). Arenas, which are based on recognizable real-world locations, are fully destructible and can be altered by players.
The open beta adds the new Skyway Stadium to the map rotation. The beta also introduces a new game mode called Bank-It, in which four teams of three fight to gather coins, with the winner either hitting a max limit first or having the most cash banked at the end of the round. 


Players will have access to 20 weapons, 26 gadgets, and 9 abilities used to reduce targets into showers of gold coins. Item progression will feature 5 Mastery Levels per weapon as well. 
The open beta is cross-platform, so players on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Steam can jump in. It will run until November 5. The beta includes a free battle pass with 16 exclusive, permanent rewards that carry over to the game’s eventual full launch.]]></summary>

Check out the trailer below:


Interestingly, Survival Ascended will have cross-platform modding on all platforms, as revealed in a post on the Xbox Wire. It looks like PC players will have the ability to actually make modes, as it requires the Ark Devkit, downloaded from the Epic Launcher, but playing mods will be available for everyone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today's Xbox Partner Preview brought us a new look at Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, the remake announced earlier this year. In the trailer, we get a first look at the game's use of Unreal Engine 5 alongside some quick snippets of tactical espionage action.
While what's shown is definitely gameplay, it doesn't appear to be final as the trailer calls it the "first in-engine look." Plus, the gameplay is watermarked with a "pre-alpha footage" tag.
Check out the Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see in the trailer above, we see Big Boss sneaking through jungles, over wooden bridges, through World War 2-esque trenches, and more. There's nothing pointing toward the game's story in this trailer but it does make one thing clear: this remake is going to be beautiful if today's showing is any indication. And the gameplay looks solid and intact – exactly what you'd imagine a 2023 remake of this 2004 classic would look like. 
Revealed back in May, coincidentally during a PlayStation Showcase, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is a from-the-ground-up remake of the third Metal Gear Solid game originally released in 2004. Like the original, this remake is a 1960s-era prequel to the Metal Gear series that tells the origin story of Big Boss. As such, it serves as a foundational narrative to the wider Metal Gear universe. 
Here are a few screenshots from today's showing:

Shooters without COD-style gear levelling ladders do exist, not least Counter-Strike 2, but most of the juggernauts depend on such fixtures, especially now that free-to-play service models have become the norm. So it's jarring to hear from Mackey McCandlish, one of Modern Warfare's original developers, that the old Infinity Ward team were split over the act of using XP to unlock guns, with some worrying it would be "unfair".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Returning with the much more SEO and annual-tradition appropriate name, The Annual Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival (formerly known as Mayor Bones Proudly Presents: Ghost Town's 1001st Annual Pumpkin Festival) is here! Every October it pops up to make your Halloween season orange and flickery with a host of digital carved pumpkins on display in a lovely gallery you can take a calming walk around. I hope this comes to be a seasonal tradition on RPS as unshakeable as Skeal at Christmas. And it's pay-what-you-can on Itch!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When two of a game's weapons are nailguns, you should probably expect players to be enthusiastic about construction. Following last year's excellent Brutalist Jam map pack, Quake mappers have reunited to release another free load of levels inspired by Brutalism and concrete. The 30 maps offer good honest fragging in everything from concrete cities to murderous mystical puzzle boxes. Honestly, I'd recommend downloading the pack even if only to see the hub level and marvel at quite how good Quake can look when made for modern PCs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're weary of Baldur's Gate 3's whimsy, or you've finished gnawing the bones of Diablo 4 and are hungry for more of that sweet, sweet grimdark, you might like to check out Beast from Polish developer False Prophet, which goes into Steam early access today. It's a turn-based tactics RPG with a Gothic historical setting, an extremely late-noughties insanity mechanic, a heavy metal soundtrack, plagues, heresy, dynastic feuding, and a protagonist with a dramatic eye scar and possibly non-metaphorical "inner demons". Amongst other things, it looks like you can run people over with a horse-drawn carriage. M-Rated enough for you, edgelords? Here's the trailer.

The developers include a few thoughts about what performance means for a management sim like Skylines 2, revealing that they considered delaying release to improve and stabilise the game, but felt that postponing launch would be "unfair" to those who are less bothered by such things.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“Not everyone is Nintendo,” Hilmar Veigar Pétursson says. “Corporate entities, historically, are not very long-living. By being 30 years old, CCP is old by company standards.” As we talk, his fixation on persistence and artefact becomes clear. Though, he’s never hidden it. In 2014, Pétursson’s company, CCP, unveiled a five-metre-tall sculpture with the names of every active player in their MMO, EVE Online, etched into its surface; this year, they expanded the monument to add the names of players who have subscribed in the decade since. “I've been obsessed about doing things like printed books, magazines, models of EVE Online...,” Pétursson tells me, “like there's this need to leave a footprint.” 



Pétursson has discovered a company that uses cow stem cells to 3D print calfskin. For the studio’s 30th anniversary, he plans to commission a poetry chapter inspired by Iceland’s epic history book, the Prose Edda, write it on the artificial skin, and put it in a Reykjavik museum. It would sit alongside an ancient calfskin copy of the Icelandic sagas. “It was written 1000 years ago, but as an Icelandic person, I can still read and understand what it says,” Pétursson explains. He tells me that it’s an effective way of storing data because if you sent a USB stick 1,000 years into the future, where would you even find a computer with a drive to read it? This appreciation for artefacts and need for legacy has led to his current project, a new game from CCP using blockchain technology, currently known as Project Awakening.

In parallel, Webtoon appears to be quietly laying the groundwork to tackle less-discussed competition; hundreds of pirate sites offering the company's content for free.
