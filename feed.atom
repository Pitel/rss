        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Block and move on.
It's been years now since Nintendo opened the eShop floodgates and started letting everything in. In stark contrast to the Wii U days when even established developers had trouble getting their games on Nintendo platforms, the weekly update is now filled with games that would have been unthinkable just one console generation ago.
For all my moaning to come, I'll make it clear up front that I'm not advocating going back to those dark days - the breadth and quantity of experiences you can download from the eShop is one of the great strides forward Nintendo made this gen. The problem that needs addressing is one of content management in an overcrowded storefront; for every promising-looking game and genuine gem, there are five cynical, bottom-of-the-barrel releases obscuring it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While I'm not about to propose the tank-like CRT screens of yesteryear are better than modern-day OLED displays, I do think there's merit in how phosphors, specifically, render pixels. That's why I was thrilled to discover someone's created a set of CRT-style overlays for the Steam Deck.


While CRT shaders have existed in some form or another for a while now as part of the ever-popular ReShade injector, getting them to render correctly is a wholly different can of worms. Some of them are also quite the performance hogs, and it's no surprise that they don't work great on low-resolution displays. The Steam Deck's humble 1200x800 screen hasn't worked well with the ones I tried. Now, however, Reddit user Traditional-Ad1708 has taken it upon themselves to fine-tune a number of CRT-style shader…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every so often, I get the urge to play puzzle games just to see if I am as smart as I (sometimes) think I am. I don't usually pour too many hours into them since my brain can only handle so much. Yet, my experience with Dungeons of Dreadrock 2: The Dead King's Secret was the complete opposite, as I constantly lost track of time with its many puzzles. I even had to force myself to put it down, with the thought of "just one more puzzle" lingering in my mind. 


DoD2 continues off from the original narrative, featuring the same retro-inspired art style. I'm new to the series, but understanding its storyline wasn't too much of a stretch. It's your classic adventure where the hero, aka the sorceress, ventures into a treacherous place to find the Crown of Wisdom.

All Arcane Garlic Crab Disney Dreamlight Valley ingredients


Arcane Garlic Crab is made with four different ingredients. Two of them require The Storybook Vale DLC. 



Sorcerer Hat Hermit Crab


Salt Crystal


Garlic


Any Spice

You'll find the Sorcerer Hat Hermit Crab by fishing at The Bind. Head to the water and try to find a golden ripple within the waves. Get your fishing rod and catch this Sorcerer Hat Hermit Crab from within it. There's a possibility of getting an extra Sorcerer Hat Hermit Crab if you hang out with a buddy who has a fishing specialty. 


Salt Crystals are found within the waters of Everafter. Fish in a spot other than a ripple to gain Salt Crystals for the recipe. 


Garlic is an easy ingredient to find in Disney Dreamlight Valley. Head to the Forest of Valor, and you'll see the crop growing within the grass. You can pick up the cooking ingredient from the soil. It has green leaves flowing from the ground. 


Lastly, you can pick any spice for the Arcane Garlic Crab. One of Storybook Vale's spices is Black Pepper, which can be bought from Goofy's Stall in The Elysian Fields from Mythopia. You can buy its seeds from Goofy for 70 Star Coins. It takes an hour and a half to grow.


After getting all of the ingredients, go to a cooking station in your house or Chez Remy. Once made, you can sell the Arcane Garlic Crab for 1,429 Star Coins or eat it for 3,265 Energy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my favourite anime shows is Sakura Quest. It's the story of an unemployed lady from Tokyo who accidentally gets herself appointed "Queen" of a struggling backwater village by the regional tourist board. From that case of mistaken identity proceeds 25 whole-ass episodes of Machiavellian haggling with crusty bigwigs over things like organising a concert. It's playfully dull, heartily mundane entertainment. No supernatural flourishes here - just the magic of paperwork and the thrill of bureaucracy.


I'm reminded of Sakura Quest by Danchi Days, a forthcoming cosy adventure with irresponsibly enticing Game Boy Advance-style visuals. It casts you as Hoshino, a teenage girl who's just moved to an old "danchi" housing complex and is trying to revive the yearly tradition of a summer festival. How will she do this? By means of haggling - haggling, and a bit of CSI.

If you’ve recently played Mario & Luigi: Brothership, then chances are you might have noticed something rather familiar with its opening cutscene. That is, of course, if you’ve also seen The Super Mario Bros. Movie from Nintendo and Illumination.
You see, both the game and the movie feature our favourite platforming siblings hurtling through a portal, desperately clinging onto each other before ultimately being torn apart and flung into different locations.

Not only are there a lot of units, but in some cases lower rarity units can be better than higher ones. I’m here to show you the best units in the game and rank them in my Ball Tower Defense unit tier list.


Ball Tower Defense Unit Tier List And Trade Values

It’s important to note that in Ball Tower Defense, Omega units are drastically stronger than any other rarity so I’ll put them in a special SSS tier of their own. Then, I’ll rank units from S to E-Tier where the top two Tiers S and A are must-haves in your loadout. B-Tier are all-around great options that just lack the raw power of higher Tiers. Lastly, C, D, and E are for beginners and I would Reforge these …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Towers of Aghasba, Feathers are an Uncommon material used for several differing crafting recipes. Since it is Uncommon, it isn't the easiest resource to find, but if you know where to look, they aren't difficult to obtain.


Where to get Feathers in Towers of Aghasba


Obtaining Feathers in any reasonable amount will require you to sacrifice precious Amity, because the most common source of them is by hunting animals. While I have not found every single creature roaming the wilds of Aghasba, I have found a number that has a chance to drop Feathers when hunted and killed. 


Your first instinct to find Feathers may be to look for birds flying in the sky, but the easiest way to obtain them actually comes from a slow-roaming creature on land. The chubby Fuzzyfin has a decently high chance of dropping Feathers, and they are very easy to hunt due to how slow they are. They also don't have a large health pool, able to be slain with two Flint Arrows, the weakest type.

Fuzzyfins are by far the easiest way to obtain Feathers en mass because they are a common animal found in Tropical Ecosystems, which you will have access to just by following the Towers of Aghasba's main story quest. They roam this Ecosystem at all times of the day and are naturally curious creatures meaning they will not flee from you once approached. Also, if you really want to get efficient with hunting them down, use Lectuce to lure them into groups for easy pickings. Just don't kill too many of them, or you will suffer significant Amity loss, something you want to avoid.

Playtonic Friends, the publisher behind the Yooka-Laylee series, has announced that it is bringing the cosy cowboy farm sim, Cattle Country, to Switch in 2025.
Developed by Castle Pixel, this one plants a lot of Stardew Valley-shaped seeds. In Cattle Country, you'll be settling down in the Wild West, working on a ranch and making friends with the locals. With crops to be planted, cattle to be raised and NPCs to be wooed, the farm sim trappings are loud and clear. But this one also packs in explorable mines, bandits, and hunting to beef (pun absolutely intended) things up.

However, many of you will be pleased to know that MachineGames' Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will not be shipping with the offending DRM software when it launches on December 9.


This was confirmed by publisher Bethesda in a post on X recently. The message seems to be a reply to a now-deleted comment from a user, prompting the studio to say that The Great Circle "does not include Denuvo." This was then followed by a statement declaring that it was only ever used in "review builds for leak precautions."




Indeed, if you look on the game's official Steam page, you can see down the right-hand side that a third-party EULA needs to be agreed to before playing the game, but there's no mention of DRM in use…]]></summary>

They’ve heard player feedback on the missing weapon oomph caused by the lack of hitstop in the Monster Hunter Wilds beta, and they’re bringing back the bonk.
Here’s a handy breakdown of the issue by X user Blue Stigma, but briefly: hitstop is the brief pause in an attack animation the moment the weapon connects with an enemy, giving you a real sense of bonkitude and making say, a hammer feel different from a dagger. As the video showed, the hitstop was greatly reduced in Wilds compared to previous Monster Hunters, and many players reported the combat just feeling a bit off as a result.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'll come out and say it: I had no idea, really, what Infinity Nikki was about before I dove in. I knew from some trailers that it was a free-to-play game about collecting pretty dresses and exploring a relentlessly positive open world. In those respects, I was correct.
I'd just missed the really big part - the fact it's a pacifistic Genshin Impact wearing a pretty dress. And as that realisation sunk in for the first time, my heart also sank with it. I really tried, I mean really tried to get into Nikki's gacha offerings; to delight in its menagerie of menus and cash in countless currencies for fun socks or glitzy tiaras. Sadly, I won't be logging back in ever again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EA Sports has officially confirmed the Ultimate Succession promo, which is coming up next in EA FC 25 Ultimate Team.


There have been plenty of fresh campaigns in Ultimate Team this year, and the Ultimate Succession promo will add to that list. You'll be able to find the cards in packs starting Friday, but EA Sports hasn't revealed which items will be available on the promo. However, a few leaks have already begun making their rounds on social media.


All EA FC 25 Ultimate Succession promo players


So far, there have been a few leaks about which footballers are going to be featured in the Ultimate Succession promo. It's safe to say that all of them are pretty well-known in the world of football, and Barcelona fans will certainly love the items.



Lamine Yamal


Lionel Messi


Marcus Thuram


Steven Gerrard (Icon)


James Milner


Manuel Akanji


Gregor Kobel


Nico Schlotterbeck


Joshua Kimmich


Joao Palhinha


Le Sommer 


Selma Bacha


Roman Burki


Marquinhos


Jorginho


Sandro Tonali



However, plenty of names are expected to be revealed as leaks over the next couple of days. EA Sports could also hint at a few cards that will be made available in the promo. If the rumors are to be believed, the upcoming campaign will have Heroes and Icons as well. If that turns out to be true, Ultimate Succession will become the first promo this year to feature all three cards - active footballers, Heroes, and Icons.


As always, some of the names that will be revealed as leaks could appear as SBCs and objectives. Lately, EA Sports has dropped some expensive SBCs as part of the Thunderstruck promo, and the community will hope for a few reasonably priced ones.


Once we have more leaks, they will be added to the list mentioned here. Always remember that leaks are just an indication of the cards rumored to appear in a promo. The official stats, playstyles, and roles will be revealed only after the promo goes live on Ultimate Team.

A new hand-drawn 3D platformer is heading to the Nintendo Switch in Q1 2025, and by gum, it's looking rather lovely indeed.
Ruffy and the Riverside comes from developer Zockrates Laboratories and looks to bring some of that iconic Nintendo inventiveness into a gorgeous world full of hand-drawn characters and assets. The general concept involves a unique ability to copy and paste (or 'swap') textures onto new areas to assist in traversal. So for example, if you see a waterfall, you can paste a vine texture onto the water in order to climb it. Simples!

Although we don't have a release date for Capcom Fighting Collection 2 just yet, the good news is physical pre-orders are already live in the US.
This includes physical editions for both the Switch and PlayStation 4. There'll also be a 48-page Capcom vs. SNK comic (which we guess is similar to the one in Marvel vs. Capcom) included in the box and available "while supplies last". Here's a teaser of this comic:

They even tackled the fascinating yet highly controversial topic that is generative Artificial Intelligence in gaming.


With the recent rise of generative AI, many developers, designers, etc., worry that this brand-new technology may end up taking over their jobs. When asked about this, Hulst responded, "I suspect there will be a dual demand in gaming: one for AI-driven innovative experiences and another for handcrafted, thoughtful content." But then he added, "Striking the right balance between leveraging AI and preserving the human touch will be crucial."

Hitomi Furuta, one of the game's designers, confirmed that developing 3D visuals for Mario & Luigi: Brothership was a challenge and that Acquire was searching for a new Mario & Luigi style. "At one point we ended up trying to present an edgier, more rugged Mario instead.

Fortnite is changing all the time. Gone are the days of Dusty Depot, Tomato Town, and Fatal Fields (god, do we sound old?) as the map is shaped and reshaped each and every season, bringing in new mechanics, locations and unexpected crossovers.
Diving into a game today had us looking around the place like that one John Travolta Pulp Fiction GIF, but, with 'Chapter 6 Season 1: Hunters' kicking off this week, we were pleased to see one familiar face make a return amongst the newbies: the 'No Emote' sign.

It might be the fact that the survival title is in early access, but Nuclear Nightmare doesn't appear to explain the respawn system clearly. There's a guide in place, but many players seem to be puzzled about how to revive themselves in case they have died. Let's look at how you can respawn and what the best use of the system is.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Chimy Avila World Tour SBC is now live in EA FC 25, and you can get a special card for your Ultimate Team squad. 


After a streak of expensive SBCs, we finally have a cheaper option on our hands. This card belongs to this season's World Tour theme, and it's the first special item for Avila this year. Let's take a look at how you can complete the challenge and if you should do so at all. 


EA FC 25 Chimy Avila World Tour SBC tasks


The Chimy Avila World Tour SBC has two tasks, and here are the required conditions. 


Task 1 - Argentina



Min. 1 Players from: Argentina


Min. Team Rating: 83



Task 2 - LaLiga



Min. 1 Players from: LALIGA EA SPORTS


Min. 1 Players: Team of the Week


Min. Team Rating: 84



EA FC 25 Chimy Avila World Tour SBC solutions


Here's a set of solutions you can use to complete the challenge. 


Task 1 - Argentina



Any 10 83-rated items


Guido Rodriguez 83



Task 2 - LaLiga



Any 86-rated TOTW item


Lukaku 82


Smalling 82


Jonsdottir 82


Zubimendi 81


Sellner 82


Hagering 82


Lohmann 82


de Ligt 84


Reiten 88


Ake 84



This Avila item is suitable for those who have yet to have a good forward for their LaLiga-based squads. The card has 86 overall, but Pace (86), Shooting (89), and Physicality (92) is more than decent. Additionally, he also offers 5* Weak Foot and the Advanced Forward++ role. You'll also get Chip Shot+, Finesse Shot, Power Shot, and Long Ball, and Avila can play as a LM and RM. 


He looks like a pretty useful utility option, and the relatively low overall rating means that the card might be eligible for upgrades as part of an upcoming evolution.

How to defeat Dror Ragzlin in BG3


The easiest way to defeat Dror Ragzlin in BG3 is to push all his goblin soldiers down the pit while your tankiest characters deal with him. Make sure you always have someone ready to heal whoever is taking blows from his Faithbreaker Warhammer. Keep his goblin allies away from him to prevent his Aura of Leadership from boosting their damage. 


However, you must not push him down the pit if you want Dror Ragzlin's magic Warhammer, the Faithbreaker, or his Mind Flayer Parasite. Doing this makes him disa…]]></summary>

It’s safe to say that, 146 million sales later, Nintendo’s risk of launching a dockable handheld console in 2017 has paid off handsomely. After all, Sony’s PS Vita was all but dead by that point, and despite the 3DS managing to reverse its fortunes after a swift price drop in its first year, many claimed that the rise of mobile gaming would spell the end of handheld consoles.
Yet the Switch proved the naysayers wrong and, if anything, ignited a renewed interest in handhelds the likes of which we haven’t seen in years. Mobile gaming has fallen by the wayside (somewhat - though Nintendo properties have also dipped their toes in the water here), and, we now have a bevvy of powerful handheld consoles to choose from, including the Steam Deck, the Asus ROG Ally X, the Lenovo Legion Go, and many more. Yet despite the growing competition, the Switch has comfortably maintained its position as the king of handheld gaming in 2024.

Fear not, say game director Corinne Busche and series creative director John Epler, for the universe of Dragon Age has many yarns yet to spin. The next game won't necessarily be an action game with RPG trappings, either, for much like Final Fantasy, Dragon Age exists in a state of continual "reinvention".

Civilization VII is just a few months away from launch — we still have to pinch ourselves when saying that — and as you might expect, the success of Civilization VI on Switch has influenced a few of the design decisions for that game.
What you might not expect, however, is that Firaxis didn't expect just how successful the game would be on the hybrid console. Speaking to Christopher Dring over at GameIndustry.biz, executive producer Dennis Shirk noticed that PC players (their core player base) were double-dipping: "We found that a lot of our PC players were getting the game on Switch because they could take their game with them."

This latest update brings the Switch edition of the game up to ver. 1.0.103.9, and it really seems to be all about the performance. In an accompanying BlueSky post, the developer stated that the "entire game has been significantly optimised", with frame rate improvements in "almost every circumstance".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Phew, close one!
After the sad closure of long-time Mario & Luigi developer AlphaDream, many fans had given up hope that a new entry in the franchise would see the light of day.
Now, according to a new 'Ask the Developer' feature, it seems even Nintendo was close to throwing in the towel before approaching Acquire to commence co-development on Mario & Luigi: Brothership. The interview gathers Akira Otani and Tomoki Fukushima from Nintendo EPD alongside director Haruyuki Ohashi and designer Hitomi Furuta from Acquire and delves into the conception and development of the game ahead of its launch earlier this year.

There are hundreds of hours of Main Scenario Quest (MSQ) content, and that’s without counting side quests, content not related to the story, or duties outside of it. There’s a whole world to get lost in, and it can seem a bit daunting, but it's not so bad if you break it down into manageable chunks.

Sally was first teased as a new addition to the Valley back in August, when the Gameloft dev team shared a roadmap of upcoming content for the latter half of 2024. It’s hard to figure out why she wasn’t included as part of the Halloween festivities, but she’s finally coming.

And while it features other familiar names to Danganronpa fans — series artist Rui Komatsuzaki and composer Masafumi Takada return after reuniting with Kodaka on Master Detective Archives: Rain Code — there are a few new wrinkles that make this pretty different from the pair's previous games.

How to Find the Anime Power Defense Trello


Screenshot by Destructoid


Here are all of Anime Power Defense’s community channels where you can get the latest info on the game:



Official Anime Power Defense Trello.


APD Discord Server.


Community Anime Power Defense Wiki.


APD Roblox Community.



For clear-cut and organized information on the game, I highly recommend that you check out the Trello board first. There, you can find every piece of content and mechanic in the game sorted by category. Examples include:



Info on different currencies.


Missions.


All rewards.


All Game Modes.


Updates.


All Units are sorted by rarity.


All Skins.


All Powers.


All Items.


All Emotes.


Information on all lobby stations.


Unit tier lists.


Any previous events.



The APD Wiki holds the same type of content but goes in-depth to explain each unit or game mode instead of just listing them. Both are run by the community, so you can expect regular updates on everything as they’re highly active on both platforms.


On the other hand, if you’re not looking for technical objective information and are looking for a more subjective approach, check out their Discord. The community gathers there to discuss strategies, best units, farming methods, and a lot more. This is also where you can ask specific questions you might have in both the General and Questions-and-Help channels.


Lastly, Discord is also where you can check out the latest updates, announcements, and patch notes. I’d recommend staying up to date on these for any giveaways that might pop up. Speaking of free stuff, codes can be found here, too. Stay tuned to Destructoid for more Anime Power Defense guides.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this modern gaming era, we kind of just accept that new releases need a lot of tinkering post-launch, and STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is no different. 


Having spent a decade and a half in development, the long-awaited sequel to the cult survival horror FPS series is doing pretty well so far, with a current meta score of 73. But it evidently still needs work (as most modern games do).


Within the past week, we've already had two patches being sent out for both the console and PC versions of STALKER 2, and now a third one has started rolling out. GSC Game World is evidently keeping a close eye on the game and player feedback, as Patch 1.0.3 comes just four days after 1.0.2.




This update seems to target issues with crashes and memory leaks, specifically fixing multiple "ACCESS_VIOLATION_ERROR" and "LowLevelFatalError" issues. Whatever all those words mean.


Fixes to missions as well


Additionally, the patch also plugs some issues with the AI, including one in which NPCs would "block the doors during the Back to the Slag Heap mission." Speaking of missions, there have been a few fixes in that region as well, though the patch notes have blanked some of the specifics, presumably to save from potential spoilers.


There was also an issue with saves, in which some people were finding their save files were missing after a hard reset of their Xbox or PC. The new update should fix this for anyone who has experienced it.


Look, it's not for me to say whether three patches in less than a week is a good thing or not. On the one hand, it shows that GSC is evidently on the case when it comes to reacting to issues and feedback. On the other, it does go back on the developer's claim that, prior to release, STALKER 2 had gone gold, suggesting it was fit for release. In any case, one can't help but suspect Patch 1.0.4 is just around the corner, for good or ill.

Nightdive Studios' The Thing: Remastered has been sitting on a 2024 release date for a while now, and while a post from the developer yesterday confirmed that it will definitely be coming in December (it is the last month of the year, after all), an Xbox Wire line-up might have given us an even more specific date (thanks to our pals at Pure Xbox for the heads up).
Titled 'Next Week on Xbox: New Games for December 2 to 6', the Xbox Wire post lists Nightdive's remaster with a 5th December release date for Microsoft's latest consoles and Game Pass. Now, this is yet to be confirmed by the developer and there's obviously no guarantee that the Switch version will arrive on the same day, but this certainly seems like a real possibility.

It’s been six years since the first Fitness Boxing was released, during which time we’ve had two main games and two spin-offs based on Fist of the North Star and Hatsune Miku. Now it’s time for the third proper entry in the series, and thankfully regular Fitness Boxing players will find some new stuff in here to freshen up their daily routine. There are new modes, new tasks, and even a new way to explore the Fitness Boxing lore. Yes, it turns out there’s lore now, apparently.
The main workout mode returns and brings with it the same strengths and weaknesses it always did. Those who played the previous games will know exactly what to expect here: after picking your workout of choice (or accepting the Daily Workout chosen for you based on your required time, intensity, and target body areas), you repeat a series of punching and dodging motions to the beat, almost like a violent rhythm game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jett: The Far Shore and Sword & Sworcery developers Superbrothers are making a new "2D mystery action pixel videogame", in partnership with an unnamed publisher. In what feels almost like a pivot away from the developers' previous, magnificently hipster experiments, it's billed as "satisfyingly finite, immediately legible, entertaining, funny, and generally satisfying for a broad audience".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Bestest best?! We’ll have that!" is how I imagine detective immersive sim Shadows Of Doubt made it on the roster for the Jingle Jam 2024 charity bundle. "RPS have never steered us wrong before!" they said, thus cementing our reputation as the most selflessly heroic gaming website, seven years running. What we can’t take credit for, however, is the 1.2 million quid they’ve raised already. If you want to make that number bigger, you can pick up the bundle here, and get 19 Steam keys for your trouble with a minimum donation of £35.
19 is such an annoying number in terms of the page layout that I’m almost convinced to never give to charity again, but there are some very nice games, including the aforementioned Shadows Of Doubt, Dungeons And Degenerate Gamblers, Citizen Sleeper, Another Crab’s Treasure, Two Point Campus, and Deathsprint 66.

While these conversions don't knowingly violate any law, Spanish music industry group Promusicae reportedly labeled the service an audio download tool. In response, Google removed the URL from its search engine and banned the associated AdSense account.  However, after the MP3 site involved its lawyer, Google reversed its decision.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I downloaded Creeper World IXE's demo, I had it pegged as a bizarre original. It is, in fact, the latest in a series of real-time strategy games in which you position turrets and terraform maps to repel surging, simulated tides of purple liquid. This is a war between flesh and mineral, solidity and fluidity that dates back to the age of Gillen. Alex Wiltshire (RPS in peace) interviewed creator Virgil Wall back in 2019 - amongst other things, we learn that the original Creeper World was based on a "failure" - and Sin has an  enthusiastic piece from 2021 about Creeper World 4, the first 3D instalment.
What does Creeper World IXE bring to the party? Well, 1) it ain't 3D, and 2) it's billed as an exercise in "dominating" the titular Creeper, rather than keeping it at bay. For too long has this sloshing, coruscating hooligan been allowed to wash over and corrode our precious starports. We will take the fight to it in the shape of an upgradeable 2D starfleet, equipped with lasers we can use to chisel away the geography and re-rout the flow of villainous Vimto.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tic-tac-toe, known to British people as noughts and crosses, is a famously boring game that is nonetheless often played by anybody with a sweet wrapper, a pencil and five minutes to burn while waiting for any form of public transport. It's boring because it's a "solved game" whose outcomes can be safely predicted regardless of where you place your first nought or cross, allowing the "perfect" player to at least draw their opponent. It gets played regardless because a lot of people don't know it's a solved game - specifically, young children you may wish to humiliate using your superior grown-up brain, because when you were a child somebody did the same to you. 
How many twisted adults were born from the experience of being bullied via the medium of tic-tac-toe? We'd be better off without this game. But look! Here comes Tic Tactic to shake things up with a touch of Balatro.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“If, two months ago, you’d been told to close your eyes and imagine a Two Point game about a museum, you’d come up with something at least 85% identical to Two Point Museum,” wrote James, previewingishly. After spending a few hours with a beefier build, I’m inclined to agree. But, much like Campus (which gave you real incentive to actually run a smooth operation that genuinely benefited the lazy ratbags stinking up your dorm halls) it’s that extra 15% that really makes all the difference.
James already covered the new exhibits system, and how acquiring and displaying them changes the way you run things, but such globetrotting adventures do little to rattle the pulse of a world-weary mapmuncher like me. No, what I’m actually most excited for when Two Point Museum releases next February is possibly the most ostensibly uninteresting feature added to any videogame ever - partition walls.

But at least video games can help us speculate. Heart Of The Machine is a cyberpunk 4X strategy game that will let players choose how a newly awakened AI sentience might behave once set loose upon a big future city. Developers Arcen Games call it a "turn-based sci-fi 4X RPG", which is a lot of genres fighting for supremacy in one small phrase.

"We’re deeply saddened to share the news that Warcraft: Orcs and Humans and Warcraft II will leave our store on December 13th, 2024,” wrote GOG on X. "Seeing these masterpieces leave our store is tough, but it also serves as another reminder of why our mission at GOG is so important.

I have never been more grateful for this recurrent Quixotic daydream's mass market failure than when watching trailers for Urge, an open world survival shooter that is both fuelled and plagued by piss.


"But hold your horses, young Edwin," you sternly interject. "I do not wish to hear about, let alone play an open world survival shooter that is both fuelled and plagued by piss, on a website that children might read. It sounds like a cheap, taboo-jabbing gimmick." Friend, I once thought as you. But then I did a little research, as is my journalistic responsibility, and it turns out Urge's notions about piss - bladdergold, as they call it in the West Country, or Crusoe Cola, as it's known in the States - are rather in-depth. I'm still very glad I can't smell the game, but I definitely have the urge to play it.

If, however, you’re hoping to switch to the 9800X3D from an older system with DDR4 RAM, you’ll need to upgrade that as well as the motherboard, as the entire Ryzen 9000 series only works with newer DDR5 memory.
Cyber Monday won’t help materialise more processors into retailers’ warehouses, but it can help you make this RAM switch on the cheap. Relatively speaking. And I can recommend a nice, fast 32GB kit of Corsair Vengeance DDR5, which is down by £43 in the UK and $22 in the US.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While Mechabellum’s disparate roster of roast ’em riddle ‘em robots might initially seem to lack the characterful coherence of a writhing Zerg ecosystem or ancient Greek phalanx, this strategy autobattler’s array of lumbering tanks, hulking automata, and zippy fliers do share a common thread: each one of them has the potential to be either the most terrifying nuisance on the field, or to instantly crumble like a soggy strudel in an angry washing machine. With each mech able to become another mech's worse nightmare, it becomes a game about stretching tight budgets to balance reactive counters with devastating offensives; about identifying the butterfly wings that can send tornados through your opponent’s ranks. It’s about the moments that eat up the hours like nothing else.

The developers of a heavily criticised mod for Half-Life 2 are intentionally blocking a small number of YouTubers from playing that mod, using Steam IDs to effectively blacklist and ban specific people from running it. Instead of launching the game as expected, these players will see the first-person shooter crash, alongside an error message that reads: "STOP talking SH1T about us". This is an act of revenge for previous criticism of the mod, say the affected videofolks, who are described in the mod's code as "anticitizens".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[‘Confident’ game design is one of those slightly fluffy critic words I sometimes find myself reaching for tenuously, knowing that - sigh - I’m going to have to do all sort of detestable nonsense like ‘back up my vague assertion with concrete examples that are useful to the reader’ if I do. Yuck. If there’s one type of design that deserves the accolade, though, it’s RPGs that are assured enough in the richness of their worlds to not feel the need to signpost every discovery.
It’s a feedback loop of charitable feelings: the game is saying "we think you’re smart enough to find this stuff on your own". "You’re right!" you respond. "I am smart! And anyone who recognises that must be one smart cookie". Joy abounds, it rains Tunnock’s Caramel Wafers, hedgehogs jig gracefully in the street, and all is right with the world. So, I must say, I’m quite pleased to hear Avowed’s environment region director Berto Ritger sing the virtues of missable content to GamesRadar.

Glancing over that map as a newcomer to the game, my eye was caught by the creator's casual mention that Caves Of Qud is technically 2,147,483,646 levels deep.
"Is Caves Of Qud really 2,147,483,646 levels deep?" I asked Brendy, like a wide-eyed child asking whether there is such a thing as dog heaven. Brendy wasn't sure. (About Caves Of Qud, I mean, not dog heaven.) So I put the question to one of the developers, Freehold Games co-founder Brian Bucklew. In brief, the answer is yes, but with some significant caveats.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the many high concept ludonarrative experiments I’d one day like to bring to fruition is an immersive sim in which the player has access to many guns, but their default arsenal selection is an open packet of crisps which they hold out in front of them, in first person, and offer to NPCs. Some NPCs wouldn’t be swayed by this, but some would lower their weapons at the offer of a prawn cocktail treat, and so you’d be constantly playing chicken with various guards: edging closer toward them, your shaking hands rattling the delicious disks inside the oily packet, mentally weighing up whether it's worth risking them turning hostile at the last second.
Obviously, I’d scan some real crisp packets and just alter the logos for maximum immersion. One game that’s already taken this scanned bricolage concept and run with it to beautiful effect is Hyperdrive Inn. It’s an avant garde point and click adventure from Finnish studio Horsefly, where the entire world is constructed from scanned fabric samples. Have a looksee.

Do bits of your HUD keep disappearing? Be of good cheer, for GSC Game World have released the first proper S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart Of Chornbyl update, which patches out over 650 different bugs and issues. These range from more significant problems such as crashing and progression-blockers in certain missions, to relatively negligible stuff like wonky NPC voice volume during storms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Samsung Pro Plus is, alongside the Logitech G502 Hero, one of those hardware products that rocks up at literally every single sales event in the calendar. Just an endless cycle of microSD cards, mice, microSD cards, mice. At least it’s a good'un, though - the best Steam Deck-compatible microSD of them all, in fact. Previously, its one weakness was the lack of a truly cavernous 1TB model, but that was amended earlier this year, and now that capacity is getting its first major saving as part of Black Friday 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cyber Knights Colon Flashpoint does not lead with its best foot. This is easier to shrug off while it's still in early access, but I will confess some relief when I read that the Trese Brothers (It's pronounced "Trese") nudged their estimated release date back to 2025. It needs a bit longer. But I'm about ready to start recommending it.
I'm a tad biased by my love for their previous Star Traders Colon Frontiers, an interest in mercenary management, and a wish for more turn-based tactics games that aren't bloody XCOM again. That I have reservations about what CKF hasn't yet nailed down is in part a symptom of high expectations. And because despite carrying over some design ethos from Frontiers, Cyber Knights is a very different kind of game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back when Digital Extremes were largely known for collaborating with Epic Games on the Unreal Tournament series, they made a little game called Dark Sector. Released in 2008, it's part of the fine tradition of post-Gears double-A actioners that basically consist of taking a gruff man, throwing him into a world of grit, gravel and burning oil drums, and handing him a murderous gimmick. Dark Sector's gimmick was the glaive, a pointy boomerang you could use to scoop up objects, solve puzzles, and kill stuff in third-person view.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To be clear, I still think the best graphics card deal of Black Friday week is that RTX 4070 Super offer and oh no wait that one’s gone now. But even if hadn’t been ecommerced to death, there’d still be a way to get the upgraded ray tracing and DLSS 3 frame gen tools of the RTX 40 series for less cash still: plucky 1080p contender, the RTX 4060, whose deals are still very much available and kicking.
In the UK, the best available prices are for the MSI GeForce RTX Ventus 2X Black edition, which is the partner card I happen to own myself – and has become the effective go-to GPU for RPS game performance tests. Over in the US, meanwhile, the Gigabyte GeForce RTX 4060 Gaming OC is the most affordable of all; it’s a chunkier design than that of the compact Ventus 2X, though that’s mainly just the tradeoff for having an extra fan. These cards were already on the cheaper end of the RTX 4060 spectrum, and now they’re £30 / $35 off in the sales. Bargain.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As far as Black Friday deals go, the Logitech G502 Hero isn’t so much low-hanging fruit as it is a root vegetable. Every year, this damned multi-buttoned mouse goes on sale, and every year, I’m powerless to avoid writing about it. Can’t even be bothered to take a different header image photo. It’s partly your fault, you know. You like it too much.
This time it’s down from £80 to £26 in the UK (£27 outside the Bezos Empire), which isn’t quite an all-time low, but is pretty close – and a silly-good price for such a capable mouse in any case. Its US discount price of $35 ain’t half bad either, though I notice Amazon US is shouting louder about knocking the newer G502 X down from $80 for $45. That’s mostly a fine mouse as well, though I find its redesigned scroll wheel a bit too much on scratchy side. Of the two, I’d stick with the classic.

The first-person shooter, which is replete with satisfying explosions, gunfire, bullet ricochets, smashing glass, sparks, goo, blood spatters, dust, ice particles, smoke, flecks of plaster, and bad guys yelling at one another about how she's over there, may be described as noisy, both in the aural and visual sense of the word. Which is how we like it, you understand. This latest update to the early access shooter leans into that by layering on even more juicy shootFX. It also adds a whole new game mode and plenty of other tweaks. The bad news is that some story bits are now delayed.

Doubly so in the wake of The Callisto Protocol - a game I still think is worth picking up on a deep discount, if you like hitting gross things with a big bit of metal. It’s quite exciting, then, to learn that the next game from Lies Of P developer Round 8 Studios might just replace that severed limb. Alongside a sequel to the puppety soulslike, they’re also working on a sci-fi survival horror game, via Eurogamer.

But here’s a properly chunky Black Friday discount on the most endearingly out-there Steam Deck rival to date, the Lenovo Legion Go: the 512GB model has shed hundreds of pounds/dollaridoos to fall all the way to £479 / $500. That’s really not a lot for something that goes full luxe on its display and build quality, not to mention its party trick of letting the two controller sections split off, Nintendo-switch style, with one acting as a portable mouse.
This is also the cheapest that the Legion Go has ever gone, at least in the UK, so could make a good pickup if you’ve been wanting something with more power than the Steam Deck range but have been put off by the Legion Go or Asus ROG Ally X’s high launch pricing.

It's small in scope, for one, but also VR would let you see through the eyes of the tooter and slide your trombone note up and down by holding the motion controllers up to your face.

So it is in Trombone Champ: Unflattened, a VR spin-off that's out now.

It is spiritually winter, the season of wearing gloves and using my phone's flashlight to look for my dog's poos in the long grass. Yet it's not the Steam winter sale that started yesterday, but the Steam autumn sale. 

Discounts are definitely never a bad thing, but Steam sales used to feel like big events on the PC gaming calendar. They don't anymore, to me. Friends, are Steam sales still exciting to you?

Originally launched in 2012, the game saw a morbid upsurge in popularity during the early years of Covid, as millions of people sought to model the pandemic's advance or just play out their anxieties. Perhaps seeking to wash away any lingering bad karma, Ndemic have now unveiled After Inc: Revival, a blend of city builder and miniature 4X set in the aftermath of a zombie apocalypse. In Plague Inc, you brought the world to an end; now, you must grow it anew from the wreckage.

But what if you could not only survive it, but tame it?
I am Bohdan Beastmaster, aspiring wrangler of all the radiation-twisted insults to God that occupy the Zone. One of its rogue Artifacts exploded my flat, and rather than find a place on SpareRoom, I’ve gone for the easier and safer option of venturing into the wilds of Chornobyl – armed not with rusty AKs or scavenged grenades but the teeth and claws of my mutant soon-to-be companions. The absence of any actual fauna-influencing tools or techniques only makes my plan even simpler: find beasts, aggro beasts onto human enemies, win.

The number of corpses and spilled backpacks on the road imply that someone in battalion headquarters (if such a place even exists) has made a terrible decision.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The genre of 'Action RPG' is supremely annoying to write about, because the term can mean different things to different people, but here’s how I see it: Diablo 4 and similar games, such as Path Of Exile, are 'ARPGs'. Which stands for 'Action RPG'. But Zelda games are 'Action RPGs', which is a totally different genre that you could, if you felt like it, also shorten to 'ARPG'. So, to summarise: ARPGs and ARPGs are two different things, and both are Action RPGs. Got it? Great.
It’s because of this kerfuffle that I’m not exactly mad at Diablo boss Rod Fergusson recently suggesting that we just call games that are similar to Diablo 'Diablo-likes'. I just find it very funny that he’s the one saying it, in a bold faced act of admittedly very inconsequential linguistic colonialism that carries the unspoken connotation that something is "like the game I make, but a bit crap".

Here's the gist of it: I've had enough of gathering rocks and sticks to make a crafting bench, from which I'm forced to build a hut and so on. I'm sure for some this is riveting, but for me, it's something I tire of within seconds.
And so it's with a heavy heart I say that Towers Of Aghasba suffers from the same starting gamut of sticks and stones. There's a hint of some interesting ecosystem stuff springing up a bit later, and judging by the trailers, an ability to clamber on massive flying creatures made of what looks like elephant skin and hair. Still, I just can't do it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've gone on record as not being a huge fan of the artstyle choices used in the new Warcraft I & II remasters. It's crisp and readable, sure, but I'm never exactly thrilled to see all the roughness of older sprites completely done away with, especially when I always felt some of that ruggedness was the point. The tendency of remasters to treat every characterful oddity as a blemish is a wider topic than the scope of this article, but one day, Bluepoint will remaster Bloodborne, and the world will feel my pain. 
Anyway. Nowadays, I'd say Blizzard - or, World Of Warcraft, at least - is pretty much synomous with a softer, more colorful approach to fantasy worlds. While I don't pine for a return to the more boobily ridiculous elements of Frank Frazetta's style, I do often wish that some of the more expressive, pained, and physically grounded elements of classic Sword And Sorcery art was a bit more common. I'm no art scholar, and there's undoubtedly a bit of tunnel vision of my part to this assertion, but as far as as pop culture goes: I see the Blizzard version of fantasy more than I see the Frazetta version, and I don't exactly love it. Same goes for the older, punkier, less uniform sci-fi art from things like 2000 AD and Warhammer 40,000. Edwin touched on some of this in his excellent Space Marine piece. 
Anyway, a valued RPS community member on the Discord shared an older bit of art by Blizzard's Chris Metzen, from the original Starcraft manual. I figured a few of you might enjoy seeing these older pieces, considering how much the overall look of their games has changed over the years.

Certainly, I wasn't expecting brand new subclasses for every class in the game, which is what you'll get with the just-announced Baldur's Gate 3 patch 8, together with new crossplay functionality and a full-figured photo mode.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Slipways was the best grand strategy game I'd played in years, because it tossed out all the genre's micromanagement in favour of a strategy puzzle where all your exploiting, expanding, et ceteraing could be squeezed into an hour's play. That game began as a PICO-8 prototype by designer Jakub Wasilewski before being polished to a fine shine in its full release.

All of which is just lead-in to talking about Solitomb, a solitaire-based dungeon crawler in which you fight demons by building hands of playing cards. It's currently - heywaitaminute - a pay-what-you-want PICO-8 prototype by designer Jakub Wasilewski where "all money earned goes towards making the bigger version possible." Like Slipways, it already seems like a frightfully clever piece of design.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Announced last year, Exo Rally Championship does what the name suggests: takes the rugged, weather-battered terrain of Exo One's interplanetary journey and replaces the ponderous plot and gravitational rise-and-fall spaceship movement with a six-wheel, space buggy rally competition. Or put another way, if Exo One was Christopher Nolan's Tiny Wings, then this is Colin McRae's Interstellar.

Now there's a demo, and it's substantial with a tutorial, a 10 stage rally, and three "ever-changing Daily Stages with online Steam leaderboards."

Operation Takendown reportedly dismantled an international pirate IPTV network serving 22 million users and generating an estimated €3 billion per year. At least 11 suspects were detained, over 100 are under investigation.

I get that you’re going for a cocktail of Divina Commedia and FromSoftware associations, but you have to remember that this is the internet and we're all desperately crude. I can’t speak for people from other English-language countries, but when I hear somebody talking about their "ring of fire", I tend to assume they’ve been at the vindaloo.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[System requirements are on the rise, and a glut of recent PC facepunchers has left some of the RPS treehouse wondering if it’s time for a graphics card upgrade. Being a helpful colleague and a handsome friend, I dutifully informed them that the highly capable Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Super is currently getting the Black Friday price cut treatment, with Zotac’s Twin Edge model dropping especially low in both the UK and US. Still, dear readers, if you feel like punishing us for that comment system switch, you could always head over to Amazon and buy up all the stock yourself.
$590 is a decent deal for a model that’s spent most of the past few months at $610, but us Brits are getting the better bargain here - even if it’s not for the OC version. £500 means a hefty £49 slasheroo, the deepest discount this card has seen yet, and you’ll also get a key for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle to play when it releases on December 9th.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's often claimed by liars and fools that our website's title is a clever reference to the ancient Chinese game of shoushiling - or "rock paper scissors", as it's known overseas. The orthodox interpretation is that "Rock Paper Shotgun" is a folksy regional variation on this, with a "shotgun" instead of the "scissors". But friends, this is patently absurd. Think about it: a game that pits a shotgun against a rock or piece of paper would be incredibly one-sided. It goes against reason!
The sad reality is that the origins of our website's title have been deliberately obscured, allowing cold hard fact to slither back into legend. Behind that mockingly nonsensical moniker sleeps an eldritch truth of such gravity it would make Gandalf spill his mead. Friends, the Rock Paper Shotgun is real. The Weapon exists. Or at least, it once did - and will, for I mean to fashion it anew by combing the writing of RPS writers gone by for raw materials. And in this endeavour, I will naturally need your aid.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In hindsight, it’s surprising that it took so long for hardware manufacturers to start making "gaming" earbuds. If the likes of chairs, glasses, and chewing gum can be painted stealth-bomber black and prefixed with the G word, why not something that can actually get off its harshly angled bum and help pipe the games themselves into your head?
Then again, maybe gaming earbuds were just waiting for their moment. Obviously the Nintendo Switch is the Nintendo Switch, but the rise of handhelds like the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally has driven desires for more portable (yet games-friendly) noise-deliverers 'round these PC parts as well. Thus, for another edition of Should You Bother With – the RPS column where a diaphragm of testing vibrates advice directly into the cochlea of understanding – let’s have a listen of these wireless buds and find out whether they’re a worthy replacement for your current go-to headphones.

But hiding in the patch notes is an apology of sorts, a nod to that most tenacious of bunnyhopper: the Half-Life 2 speedrunner. It seems the recent 20th anniversary update for the classic first-person shooter messed with some beginner speedrun strategies by introducing an invisible wall to a big sewer pipe. Valve have now corrected that, removing the offending blocker and restoring order to the universe. Well, almost.

Here's a creepy good 'un: "'Please, God, don't let it look in the closet,’ I silently prayed. 'Please, God, don't let it look in the closet,' it parroted back from the next room." You can't do that with baby shoes, you anonymous hack!
Silent Hill 2 remake’s senior narrative designer Barbara Kciuk reckons this principle extends to much bigger productions. "It is a bit niche, but actually, the interesting part about horror is that it is one of the best ratios when it comes to the cost of production and the earnings," she recently told TheGamer’s Rhiannon Bevan.

Which is a shame, as it’s a very, very good gamepad, including for PC playage. Consider these Black Friday week deals, then, as a rare opportunity to secure yourself said good gamepad without acquiescing to Sony’s stubbornness: it’s down to £40 in the UK and $54 in the US.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're playing a "PS1-style" game these days, odds are it's a horror game. Sometimes, I worry that the association of PS1 with moody, Silent Hillian dankness has gotten to the point that younger players no longer perceive the original PS1 as a video game console at all. Going by Itch.io's Halloween output, the PS1 was just a rusty bucket of rot and gore in which the faithful might periodically hallucinate the face of Spyro the Dragon.
Here to remind us that the PS1 was capable of colours beside "existential grey" is Water Level/b.l.u.e. EXPLORATION, from New York City-based game designer Hatim Benhsain. It's a free downloadable experiment inspired by b.l.u.e.: Legend of Water, a Japan-only PS1 adventure in which you are a girl swimming through alien ruins with her dolphin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes a home only becomes a home when you leave. I recently moved out from a London flat I'd rented for over a decade, for instance, and this has properly done a number on me. Being given my notice transformed the place from a transient pile of cadaverous lino and spasmodic plumbing into something mythical and unnerving – a whole chapter of my life completed and reduced to a piece of masonry in the rearview mirror, a relic I had been living in for years without quite realising.
A few video game developers have investigated emotions like these by recreating their current and prior homes as virtual environments: places of mingled memory and invention, expressive of both nostalgia and surprise. At this year's Game Developer Conference in San Francisco, I interviewed a couple of teams who are coming at this premise with very different objectives, and somehow, meeting in the middle. One of the games in question is a work of daydreaming fondness, the other of comical anger. Both find a focus in the figure of a matriarch who is kindly in one game, abusive in the other.

The specifics, I fear, are but the fumes of memories, lingering like armies of mice in trenchcoats at supermarket cheese sample platters, at once painfully obvious and immune to detection in their uncanny shroud of stifling human decorum. "For who is madder?!" I shout, in a normal and cool manner. "The mice - so very mad for cheese - or the madmen who screams ‘Mice! Mice!’ in the middle of the cheese aisle?!"

Those botched encounters are unlike previous games, where roaming bands of factional murderfolk would patrol the radioactive wastes, seemingly according to their own whims. Back in the day, this wandering baddies feature was dubbed "A-life" by developers GSC Game World - basically a jargon word for the simulation of enemies that would lead to "emergent" moments of violence and conflict. It was promised as a feature in Stalker 2 but many players have noticed it seems to be absent. Over the weekend, GSC insisted the simulation is technically present in the sequel. It's just broken.

Even if it’s you’re first time hearing his name, you’ll be familiar with his fingerprints on some of the setting’s most defining artwork. He’s responsible for that iconic imagine of the emprah - the one the best shows off the dark irony of a such a wretched figure becoming an idol of worship. While the term ‘grimdark’ originates from 40k’s "in the grim darkness of the far future…" tagline, grimdark as an aesthetic is one Blanche pioneered. There’s even a style of miniature painting - Blanchitsu - named after him.
Basically, even games that don’t use the 40k license owe an incredible amount to Blanche’s work. That’s not to mention his influence on the fantasy setting of the Total War: Warhammer series either. His piece Harry The Hammer was the cover for the first edition of Fantasy Battle - recently added to the strategy game as chaos hero Harold Hammerstorm. I could go on, and I might do so in a bit, but here’s the news: Trademark Films are making a documentary on Blanche’s work, starring Napoleon Dynamite actor Jon Heder. It’s called The Grim And The Dark: The Search For John Blanche, and it’s out next Spring. Here’s a trailer:

Total Eclipse and Total Eclipse 2.
Thimbleweed Park.
The Space Bar.
Moonbase Commander. (with multiplayer support)
Backyard Basketball.
Unrest.
Rise of the Dragon.
Castle Master.

A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
We are looking forward to your reports about successful and unsuccessful playthroughs and bugs reported!

Jestli jste z prvního filmu byli totálně nadšeni a chcete dalších 150 minut téhož, budete naprosto spokojeni. Já z něj totálně nadšený nebyl. (Ilča 50 %)]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Castle Master, the haunting conclusion to the Freescape engine saga, is now ready for public testing!
Prepare yourself for a perilous adventure as you lower the drawbridge to enter the Castle Master’s domain. Released in 1990 by Incentive Software, Castle Master became popular for its technical innovation and challenging gameplay. The game inspired countless 3D adventure titles, and the Freescape engine itself marked a technological milestone, enabling groundbreaking object interaction and spatial puzzles.
Notably, Castle Master was one of the first games to let you choose to play as either a prince or a princess, offering a different experience depending on your choice.
Your mission: rescue your twin, imprisoned within the eerie depths of Castle Eternity by the evil Magister. This sprawling, foreboding castle is filled with traps, monsters, and puzzles blocking your path. Gather items, unlock doors, and solve complex riddles as you navigate the labyrinthine halls and confront the dark forces within.
This modern reimplementation showcases enhanced graphics using OpenGL, with initial support for the DOS and ZX Spectrum releases. If you’re eager to embark on this dark journey, a playable demo is available to test your tenacity.
To participate in the testing, ensure you have a daily development build. We encourage all players to submit feedback and bug reports through our issue tracker.
Will you brave the creepy corridors of Castle Eternity and free your sibling, or will you fall victim to the Magister’s curse and join his army of enslaved spirits? The adventure awaits!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nevím, co je "legálně" zapotřebí k tomu, aby se mohl film nazývat "dokumentem", ale tohle působí jako zcela standardní nízkorozpočtový hraný film. Je to hořká komedie, která těží z atmosféry jednotlivých scén (velmi rozvláčných), aniž by měla jakýkoliv podstatný děj, směřující k nějakým pointám. (Ilča 40 %)]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dokument, který je profesionálně natočen, tzn. má tempo a atmosféru, je přehledný a dobře se na něj dívá. Co je to ale platné, když film zcela selhává v tom hlavním, tzn. v tom, aby nám nastínil, co se vlastně tehdy tomu děvčeti stalo a proč bychom se o to měli zajímat. Je nadhozeno několik navzájem si odporujících teorií (z nichž žádná není nijak překvapivá), nic se neprokáže, nic se neodhalí, a je konec. (Ilča 30 %)]]></summary>
