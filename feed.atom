        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[COPE.
One particularly bright spot in Sonic's recent history was the release of Sonic Mania. One part sequel and one part reimagining of the 2D classics, that retro revival proved to be one of the best-rated and best-selling Sonic projects in recent years. In the (frankly baffling) absence of a true follow-up to Sonic Mania, Sega has instead opted to look to that game’s inspiration for Sonic’s latest 2D release. Billed as Sonic Origins, this new collection presents all the original four Sonic games—including the rarely re-released Sonic 3 & Knuckles—in enhanced widescreen format with the new option to treat all the 2D entries as if they were all one big game. The end result is, well, exactly what you’d expect. All these classic Sonic games look better than ever with their new presentation and some light quality of life updates, but those of you who have already run through Green Hill Zone more times than you can count may be left wishing for a little more.
Clearly, the main draw of this package is the original 16-bit platformers and we’re happy to report that they each remain tremendously enjoyable in their own way. There’s good reason why so many Sonic fans remember these games so fondly (and perhaps a little longingly), and that’s because these games really got what Sonic is all about. No overwrought stories and bizarre self-insert characters here, just a blue dude with a ‘tude who fights an evil mustache man to save a bunch of animals and, eventually, the world.

Sonic Origins' launch yesterday saw the return of the blue blurs classic Mega Drive/Genesis games, all bundled together on modern consoles. The most noteworthy part of the bundle is Sonic 3 & Knuckles, which sees Sonic 3 ported to consoles with new, HD upgrades for the first time.
To help make this version possible, Headcannon — one of the developers behind the wonderful Sonic Mania — worked together with Sega to recreate the classic interlocking duo in the Retro Engine. Now that the collection is out, Stealth — the alias of Headcannon's Simon Thomley — has acknowledged some of the problems with the final release and shared some of the complications behind them on Twitter.

Motion Twin and Evil Empire's fantastic roguelike Dead Cells has received another new update as of yesterday, and it's a pretty important one too.
The studios have partnered with AbleGamers and members of the Dead Cells community to help bring in tons of new accessibility features to the game. A spokesperson for Evil Empire said that "The intent of this update is to allow players who struggle to, or cannot play, Dead Cells to be able to experience the game as we intended. We had feedback during beta testing that some people who don’t ‘need’ Assist Mode will use it regardless and the result is that they won’t play Dead Cells as a challenging roguelike."

What I wasn't expecting was to feel a bit emotional about the game's reveal, though. I mean, I felt this weird swell in my chest of excitement or something. Maybe it was the crushing jet lag, or maybe it was a heady mixture of nostalgia. Let's investigate.

Asobo Studio and Focus Entertainment have confirmed A Plague Tale: Requiem will be coming to the Nintendo Switch as a cloud version release on 18th October this year. This was announced earlier on at the latest 'Focus Showcase' alongside an extended gameplay trailer.
Requiem is the follow-up to A Plague Tale: Innocence, which was released on the Switch last year as another cloud game. The upcoming release is another rat-filled adventure. Here's a bit about the latest gameplay trailer from the PR. Unfortunately, we can't share it here on Nintendo Life due to the age restrictions in place.

One of Westwood's classics is enhanced and available again, this time for modern hardware. Blade Runner: Enhanced Edition is finally out today for PC and consoles.
Nightdive Studios put together this remastered version of the 1997 adventure classic. It's available digitally on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox consoles, and on the Nintendo Switch. The Enhanced Edition is also getting a Limited Run physical version, too.
While Westwood may be known for its history in the real-time strategy genre, Blade Runner was its surprise adventure hit. It runs alongside the Ridley Scott film, weaving through the events of the movie. It has branching paths though, and has been well-remembered for both its style and impressive design.

Remastered dreams of electric sheep
Nightdive, the studio which has tackled other remasters like System Shock: Enhanced Edition, has put a few modern touches on Blade Runner. Since it's coming to consoles, gamepad support is an obvious one.
The original Westwood videos have been upscaled to 4K resolution and 60 frames per second. There is also an HD display, and a new clue interface. Plus, international fans can use the original foreign-language translations in Spanish, German, French, Italian, and Chinese subtitles.
As for reception? Well, it currently seems iffy. Users on Steam are voting it into the Mostly Negative tier on launch day. Rock Paper Shotgun also had some words about this Enhanced Edition compared to other options, and provided some good comparison screenshots.
There is another version of the original Blade Runner just for PC, on GOG. So if your impressions of the Enhanced Edition are similarly tepid, you can at least pick that one up instead.

One of the principles of good character design is recognizability, and part of that is what a character is wearing. Can you tell which character it's supposed to be just based on their outfit? Better yet, can you tell who they are based on one article of clothing? It's not a coincidence that the most iconic pieces of clothing in video games also come from some of the best titles ever made.
Fashion has been a pretty casual hobby for me, but it really is something I love — the clothes we choose to wear can tell the world so much about us, and in this case, the clothes that the developers choose for the characters in games tell us a lot about them.
Some examples that immediately come to mind for me are Chell's jumpsuit from Portal, Clementine's hat from The Walking Dead, or M…]]></summary>

FTL developer Subset Games is at it again with another long-after-launch Advanced Edition, this time for its excellent tactical mech game Into the Breach. And beyond a free content update, strategy fans are also getting a physical Nintendo Switch edition of Into the Breach (via Fangamer) and an iOS and Android version (via Netflix). Busy day!
As the developers outlined on their website, Into the Breach Advanced Edition touches on "nearly every aspect of the game." Notably, that means five new mech squads, including four new pilots and nearly 40 new weapons, as well as "more enemies, more bosses, and more mission objectives that add additional challenge and variety to any run."

Now Sonic creator and Sonic 3 programmer Yuji Naka has seemed to lend credence to that legend on Twitter, as it relates to the replacement of certain tracks in the recently released remasters in Sonic Origins.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Plague Tale: Requiem is a stealth game with several fantastical elements. The first fantasy is that you can consistently remember how to spell "Requiem". The second is 'What would it be like if you had the power of rats?'. The third is, 'What if rats had any power to have?'. As a new extended trailer shows, the answer is: you can sense blood, and use that power to avoid the guards who want to do a big murder on you and your sister.

The trailer is worth watching for its own sake, but also comes with news: Requiem will launch on October 18th, forwarding another fantasy called 'What if a game actually came out in 2022 and wasn't delayed until next year?'.

There's been some confusion surrounding the state of the Overwatch franchise recently, especially when it comes to what will happen to the original after Overwatch 2 is released. Well, it looks like we finally have our confirmation, thanks to a Reddit AMA response from Overwatch 2's director Aaron Keller. Yesterday, when a player asked Keller if the first Overwatch will be shut down after the sequel leaves early access, he responded that "When OW2 launches on Oct 4th it will be a replacement for the current Live Service."
If Twitter is any indication, players are still pretty confused about what's supposed to happen to the first Overwatch game after OW2 is officially out.

      <p>Crystal Dynamics announced in April that Marvel's Avengers' next hero would be <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/04/19/jane-foster-is-the-next-playable-hero-in-marvels-avengers" target="_blank">Jane Foster as the Mighty Thor</a>. A new <a href="https://avengers.square-enix-games.com/en-us/news/wtw-week-95/?utm_source=twitter_playavengers&amp;utm_campaign=wtw95_blog_SQEXSOCIAL" target="_blank">War Table blog post</a> names the date fans will see the Goddess of Thunder in action.</p>

<p>Mark Monday, June 27 on your calendar as the date to watch a War Table Deep Dive detailing Jane's powers and abilities. Jane will become available as part of the 2.5 update, which arrives just a day later on June 28. That should whet fans' appetite for the&nbsp;character's Norse-powered return in the upcoming <em>Thor: Love &amp; Thunder</em>, which hits theaters on July 8.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It'll be interesting to see how Crystal Dynamics differentiates Jane's moveset from Thor's. In the comics, Jane possessed all of the abilities of Thor during her time&nbsp;as the Goddess of Thunder. The only notable difference was her ability to manipulate Mjolnir with greater control and creativity (especially when throwing it) than her predecessors, so that's something the studio can certainly hone in and expand upon.&nbsp;</p>

It's that time of year again. The Steam Summer Sale 2022 is live right now, with some deep discounts on dozens upon dozens of games.
From now until July 7 at 10 a.m. PT, developers and publishers are putting their games on various levels of sales.
And of course, there is a side-game as well. One section brings up a message from time-traveler Clorthax, who has "stolen the ten best games from the far future" and brought them back to sell on Steam.
It's essentially a scavenger hunt, it seems, with clues and hints for finding a game. It's a neat little side-venture to engage with across the days of deals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXMX4YJ7Lks
The Steam Summer Sale deals
Of course, there are the deals and discounts themselves. There is a massive amount of sales, too many to fit into one text block. So I've taken a cursory stroll through the sections and picked out a few notable ones that caught my eye:
The Sims 4 - $4.99 (75% off)
Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice - GOTY Edition - $29.99 (50% off)
Resident Evil Village - $29.99 (50% off)
Ghostrunner - $11.99 (60% off)
Devil May Cry 5 - $9.89 (67% off)

Because time no longer exists, it has already been a whole fortnight since we all sat down to watch Geoff Keighley and an array of publishers and developers showcase their wares during the Summer Game Fest live stream — and it appears that the show has been a tremendous success, breaking its own viewership records for the third year running.
According to a tweet posted by host and organizer Keighley, Summer Game Fest 2022 — which broadcast on the afternoon of June 9 — hit a peak concurrent 3.5 million viewers during the course of its 90-minute runtime. Over 6,000 accounts co-streamed the broadcast, while "Twitter Conversation" was up 100% on last year's stream, with the usage of "#thegameawards" hashtag up by 69%. Nice.
https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1539641914810572800?s=20&t=6MQpfa6v2i_FLxnf0HoA5g
Over the course of the Summer Game Fest stream, viewers were able to check out new trailers, news, reveals, and updates on a wide variety of titles currently in development for PC and consoles.
Among the many games featured we saw a trailer for Guile in Street Fighter 6, footage of space horror The Callisto Project, a cinematic for Marvel's Midnight Suns, a release date for TMNT: Shredder's Revenge, campaign footage from Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, footage of Nightwing kicking ass in Gotham Knights, and the long-awaited reveal of Naughty Dog remake The Last of Us Part I, which had, unfortunately, been leaked mere minutes before the show began.
Summer Game Fest will return in June of 2023. Before then, we can expect to see Keighley do his stage show thang thing at Gamescom's Opening Night Live stream on August 24, and, of course, at The Game Awards 2023, which is scheduled to take place this winter.

With its new Breaking Barriers update, Dead Cells has added a long list of granular accessibility options — including an Assist Mode — to help struggling players pummel the Hand of the King and ultimately rise the (Boss Cells) ranks. It's been a long time coming, and for anyone who feels like they've peaked in the game, it's time to circle back.
Using Assist Mode toggles, it's now possible to reveal the biome's map, auto-hit enemies with your primary melee weapon, auto-destroy nearby doors, give yourself more wiggle room to land parries, and make traps slower. Similar to Rogue Legacy 2's House Rules, there are also sliders — you can lower trap damage, enemy health, and enemy damage.

Just know that I've plunged hours upon hours (upon hours) into Capcom's legendary brawler, and across myriad platforms — thus, I was left reeling by some recently rediscovered tech, which is hidden away deep inside the grindhouse gutter fighter.

As noted by Japanese arcade aficionado @hijiyan_jp, (with the good word spread by dedicated brawler historian Belt Action Central), it is possible for the player to "break free" from the death grip imposed by some of Metro City's meanest villains, such as Andore and Abigail.

Nintendo of America has announced a big Switch eShop sale dubbed the "Big Ol' Super Sale", with up to 50% off some real heavy-hitting Nintendo Switch games.
Deals on Switch games such as Super Mario Odyssey (we hear it's pretty good), The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening (also not shabby), Monster Hunter Rise (another winner), and some little-known, rarely re-released game called Skyrim (never heard of it) are included in the sale.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are two reasons to consider playing the new 'Enhanced Edition' of Blade Runner over the version which hit GOG in 2019: 1) it has controller support; 2) it's on consoles. Beyond that, Nightdive's remastering has made Westwood's 1997 adventure game look notably uglier and you'd be better off with GOG's ScummVM version. The Enhanced Edition is out today and I've been flicking back and forth between the two versions, tutting. The Enhanced Edition still looks like a 25-year-old game, only now it looks 25 years old, blurry, and unlike itself.

Hello Games has locked in a launch date for the Nintendo Switch version of No Man's Sky. The studio is partnering with Bandai Namco Entertainment to bring No Man's Sky to Switch on Oct. 7, 2022.
This version of Hello Games' space exploration sim will be available both physically and on the Nintendo eShop. Those picking the game up will get all updates that have been added to the game so far (and there have been a lot), plus all future updates.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OD5Sxbeh0YE
While it's a bit later than originally intended for the Switch version of No Man's Sky, it's still wild to see this game make its way to the handheld hybrid console at all.
You can't take the sky from me
Since it first launched, No Man's Sky has been a wild game to follow. Its initial offering seemed to fall short of the expectations many had for it.
But as time carried on, Hello Games has continued to update and build No Man's Sky up, to the point that it feels unrecognizable at times from that initial launch in 2016.
Every once in a while now, we get a new update that adds something huge like smuggling or settlements into the fold. Or, you know, the Normandy from Mass Effect.
We'll see how this vast, ever-expanding universe translates to the small form factor later this year. No Man's Sky hits Nintendo Switch on Oct. 7, 2022.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I still don't know whether to describe The Heroic Legend Of Eagarlnia as "complicated" or "simple". Before starting a game, it gives an impression of being a complex grand strategy that's something like a fantasy Total War with a D&D alignment system and a distinctly East Asian focus on characters and dialogue.
It's far simpler than that. There was a period of disappointment, even, when it seemed like there wasn't much to it at all. That's partly because it's easy to play it too passively, or get stuck in attritional stand offs, and partly because of the need for a bit too much repetition. But over time its subtler details become more apparent, and your choices start to feel more multifaceted.
And yet, it remains at heart the same throughout. On your first ten turns you're doing the same actions as in your 200th, and its battles in particular are largely hands off. So maybe it's complicated, but simple to actually play? Hmm.

The Pokemon Company is currently running a distribution event for a free Pokemon Legends mask: just claim it through the mystery gift functionality!
Confirmed through the Play Pokemon Twitter account, this is indeed a cosmetic mask and not an actual Pokemon distribution, as is customary for most mainline games (on top of functional items like Pokeballs). That same account has confirmed that the distribution event will run from June 22, 2022 through June 1, 2023 at 5AM PT. So if you're putting this off for nearly a year, just remember that you need to wake up early that day.
The actual prize is called the "Shiny Baneful Fox Mask," which is "inspired by the Hisuian Snow animation." Hey, that's still kind of fresh! The third (and final) episode literally just debuted on the official Pokemon YouTube channel this week, featuring a young boy named Alec living in the Pokemon Legends timeline.
There's a lot of potential to deliver more innovative mystery gifts like this, and masks in Legends is a decent start. But there's so much more the team can do with the system, especially when you consider the last two years leading to a bigger rise in online gaming. Hopefully Scarlet and Violet will capitalize on some of that potential.

Mario Strikers' sales fell off considerably from the previous week, marking a 147% drop in total sales.
Meanwhile, in a rather curious turn of events, Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl have re-entered the top ten charts with 5,043 units sold, bringing the total sales since the games' launch to a respectable 2,560,536 units.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not even Rugal would invest
SNK delivered a double dose of news pertaining to its foremost fight franchise The King of Fighters this week, not only offering up a new trailer for The King of Fighters XV's Team Orochi, but also stealth-dropping The King of Fighters '98 Final Edition onto PlayStation platforms. It seems, however, that there was a third piece of KoF news that day... Though you might not find it for looking.
On Tuesday, eagle-eyed fans spotted a new Twitter account advertising something plainly called "The King of Fighters Crypto" (or "CryptoKOF"). This endeavor — not developed by but allegedly "authorized by" SNK — appears to be a blockchain/NFT project based upon the crossover fighting series. According to the Twitter page, The King of Fighters Crypto would see "The return of the king, to fight again in the metaverse arena."
You already know what happened next. Like so many similar announcements before it, CryptoKOF was immediately hit with insults and comments of disdain from the King of Fighters community, leading the Twitter page to go private within mere hours of its initial discovery. While this is not SNK's first dabble in the NFT market (the company already has a deal with online market OnBuff to sell NFTs based on SNK properties), it is yet another example of the gaming community turning toward the blockchain market and telling it — quite succinctly — that it is not welcome here.
And the horse you rode in on, fellas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Steve Jackson will remember that.
Way back in the day, long before video games were any good, the cool new narrative mechanic was Choose Your Own Adventure books. Wildly popular back in the '70s, '80s, and '90s, the CYOA genre died off sharpish with the invention of point-and-click games, text adventures, and video games with vast, sprawling branching stories, which allowed players to have all the fun of meaningful choices without all the tedium of having to turn to page 32 only to find out that you've died, again. Well, you still died a lot. But the computer did the page-turning bit for you, at least.
The CYOA genre came back around full circle in 2013, with Inkle's fearless adaptation of the Sorcery! books by the founder of Games Workshop and Lionhead Studios, Steve Jackson. Inkle is a studio known for its mastery of word-wrangling; the very thought of attempting to map out the intricacies of the stories the team writes is enough to send just about any writer screaming for the sweet release of death. It was Sorcery! that catapulted Inkle into the spotlight — and now, with its four-part series ported to the Nintendo Switch, hopefully more people can see why.

      <p><strong>Update:</strong> Yuji Naka has, kind of, walked back his original, unintentional confirmation that Michael Jackson worked on Sonic 3 after years of vaguely proven&nbsp;speculation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the original story, posted below, he seemingly expressed disappointment that some of Sonic 3's music has been swapped out in Sonic Origins due to Jackson's connection to it.&nbsp;In a follow-up tweet, he posted: "I feel like I'm being misunderstood a lot, probably because I don't speak English and I'm using a translation tool. Sorry."</p>

One of the photos Naka has shared is from the time when he visited "his" house, presumably Michael Jackson's Neverland Ranch in California. Just casually confirming things even more. Someone's in a talkative mood today!

Paramount Pictures has revealed that the blockbuster Sonic sequel is continuing to pull in the punters as it speeds its way through worldwide theaters. As reported by Deadline, Sonic the Hedgehog 2 has smashed past an incredible $400 million USD box office since its release in April of this year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47r8FXYZWNU
The movie, already pushing to be the highest-grossing video game adaptation of all time, sees The Blue Blur (voiced by Ben Schwartz), in a race against the evil Dr. Robotnik (Jim Carrey) to recover the fabled Chaos Emeralds. Sonic is assisted on his journey by long-time pal Tails (Colleen O'Shaughnessey) and must face down the powerful and mysterious echidna, Knuckles (Idris Elba). The sequel was praised for its comical script and likable characters, but criticized for its length and relatively rote narrative.
Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is currently number eight in the Top Ten Highest Grossing Movies of 2022, with the sequel still yet to hit the financially lucrative box office markets of Hong Kong and Japan, which will likely add further coffers to the Paramount Pictures vault. Of course, the incredible success of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is a consistent reminder of how things could have been so different for the cinematic adaptation. Still, it's good to know that the "original" movie Sonic still eventually found his way into cinema history.
Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is available now on streaming services, with a Blu-ray and DVD release planned for August. Sonic Origins launches today on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.

Pokémon GO was always designed as a mobile game to get you up, outside, and moving. But back when the pandemic kicked off in 2020, developer Niantic had to change things up considerably to allow people to still play the game while also staying safe at home.
Now, over two years later, as in-person events are returning and people are attempting to get back to a normal way of life, Niantic has started bringing back exclusive in-person raids to its augmented reality game, starting this weekend with a new raid during Community Day. But GO's game director Michael Steranka has told Eurogamer that this is a "unique experience" for this weekend, but the company hasn't ruled out making more exclusive raids.

Originally debuting on the PS4 back in 2016, the game was met with decidedly mixed reception thanks to a number of shortcomings and some bold promises from the developer that failed to come to fruition. In the years since, however, its overall standing has been given a major boost thanks to multiple expansions and improvements.

Capcom just announced a Monster Hunter Rise bonus item pack — and it has all sorts of extra consumables ready to go in it. The only catch is that you need to try the Sunbreak demo.
In case you weren't aware, Capcom announced the demo roughly a week ago during their "E3" showcase stream, and it went live on June 14. It features a selection of missions, including an ultra hard Malzeno showdown.
Here's the list of Monster Hunter Rise bonus items for playing the Sunbreak demo:
60 Mega Potions
15 Pitfall Traps
30 Energy Drinks
15 Mega Demondrugs
15 Mega Armorskins
Capcom also points out that you can get the demo directly here on Steam, or here on Switch. Seems easy enough!
While veterans will likely balk at the items you'll get here, newcomers will probably want to take them up on the offer if possible. Having a ton of free items at the start saves you a lot of time, as you can get by most of the early story content through Mega Potions alone; not having to craft them is a huge plus. And you'll have that surplus by the time you actually work your way up to the Sunbreak expansion.

Set in that most dodgy of times, the future, Hyenas is about pilfering relics of pop culture such as Pez dispensers, Mega Drives and Sonic The Hedgehog paraphernalia before tech billionaires who’ve colonised Mars can furnish their homes with it all. You can be bemused at your own leisure by watching the trailer below.

That's a £50 reduction from its normal price, and some £22 cheaper than the CPU and cooler on Amazon. This would make an excellent start to a new system, with the 3600's six cores and twelve threads pairing well with a modern RTX 20-series or Radeon RX 5000-series or later graphics card.

Valve has issued a new Team Fortress 2 update. It's the first one since the massive #SaveTF2 movement that drew attention to the massive bot problem in Team Fortress 2. And while the new update isn't a cure-all, the community seems to feel it's a start.
The update, which went live Tuesday evening, addresses several concerns. Among the updates are several that help with the bot problem in Team Fortress 2; users can no longer change names during a matchmaking game, for example. Both teams are able to run kick votes at the same time, as well as a global vote running at the same time as a kick vote. And it cleared out an exploit that allowed bots to clear the in-game chat, disrupting communication.

The day I'll be tired of life simulators will be the day that I die, which is why I'm so excited to see another great game in the genre finally get a release date. Potion Permit is an adorable little life sim, and if you haven't seen it yet, you're in for a treat (you can also play the PC demo right now, by the way). The game is set in the small town of Moonbury, where an illness has spread. As the Medical Association's most skilled potion maker, the player is tasked with helping create the cure for the ailing townsfolk.
Let's be honest, all of these games have a super cute art style, but I have to say Potion Permit has one of my favorite looks from a game like this in a long time. Plus, everything looks super polished, which is a huge plus going in. From the trailer, I can already get the sense too that we won't be in want of activities to pad out our playtimes.
https://twitter.com/PQubeGames/status/1539579544805548032
There's a ton to do in Moonbury — aside from diagnosing patients, finding ingredients for potions, and of course healing them, players can get to know over thirty of the town's inhabitants, fight off fearsome creatures, and upgrade the town and the surrounding areas. There are some RPG elements too, but we haven't gotten a good look at what those might be just yet.
Of everything Potion Permit has to offer, I think I'm probably most excited for all of the NPCs in the game. That's just around the number of NPCs you can give gifts to in Stardew Valley, and I don't want to play the comparison game too much here, but that always felt around just the right amount to me. Having a whole new cast of characters to befriend (and romance) in games like these is always a highlight for me, and I already have an NPC or two that I have my eyes on.
Potion Permit will be available on PS4, PS5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, and Steam on September 22, 2022.

      <p>Atari is among the oldest and most well-known names in the gaming industry, and it’s celebrating its 50th year on June 27. It first established its headquarters in Sunnyvale, California, neighbor to a host of now-famous tech startups. The new logo, a callback to the retro design of the old location, features the company’s classic branding alongside a semi-transparent “50.” Atari is calling the limited-time celebration logo “Borregas” after the street where you could find the headquarters.

There's a Mid-Year sale on big PS4 and PS5 games, a Level Up sale on DLC and expansions, and a Games Under $20 sale with indies, hidden gems, and older titles.
Where to start? I never know. I'm just going to toss out some chaotic recommendations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Padding it out
Microsoft has confirmed that it is currently experiencing a shortage in supply and demand for its range of Xbox controllers. The kings of the black-and-green brand spoke about its hardware troubles in a recent statement to gaming outlet VGC, who had noticed a lack of stock online and in the high street.
"We know it may be hard finding Xbox Wireless Controllers right now due to supply disruptions," a Microsoft spokesperson told VGC. "We’re working as fast as possible with our manufacturing and retail partners to improve this. Please check with your local retailer for availability."
The shortages appear to be most apparent in the UK and Europe, though North American territories are likely to follow suit if Microsoft is unable to ramp up production. According to ResetEra users, stores in Australia and The Netherlands are also struggling to keep their stock cupboards plentiful. Both standard controllers and Xbox's cool custom "Design Lab" models are affected.
Hardware and accessory shortages have continued to trouble the industry since the COVID-19 pandemic affected production and distribution cycles worldwide. From consoles to graphics cards to controllers, publishers are struggling to produce their wares with the speed and regularity of previous generations. It is a problem expected to continue into 2023 at the very least.

Fantasy farmers will have a new way to mingle and mine in Rune Factory 5 soon. XSEED and Marvelous confirm today that Rune Factory 5 is getting a PC port on July 13.
The latest entry in the Rune Factory series launched earlier this year as a Nintendo Switch exclusive. The Steam version looks to be a similar offering. It's $59.99 for the standard edition (though it's currently on a pre-launch 15% discount) or $69.99 for the Digital Deluxe, which includes the Rune Factory 4 marriage candidates outfit set. Any pre-order also nets two cosmetic outfits and a New Ranger Care Package of items in-game.

Farming up a storm
If you're new to Rune Factory, it runs in a similar vein to Harvest Moon and Stardew Valley. The key difference is that Rune Factory puts a bit more of a focus on combat and exploring dungeons than the actual farming.
Depending on what you're looking for, that can be a positive or negative. In our review of the Switch launch, Rune Factory 5 seemed to be playing the hits, while not necessarily winning over new hearts thanks to falling into some familiar pitfalls. Things can get repetitive and basic at times too.
What a PC port might offer is a performance boost, which some might welcome. All-in-all, I was a big fan of Rune Factory 4 but stayed away from the next entry after hearing some early impressions of it. I'm hopeful the Steam version gives it enough of a boost to put it back on my radar.
Rune Factory 5 launches for PC via Steam on July 13, 2022.

      <p>Sega's&nbsp;Creative Assembly is working on a brand-new game revealed today: Hyenas. The title is described as a multiplayer, multi-team&nbsp;heist&nbsp;experience set in space with a punky comic book&nbsp;aesthetic. What this means practically is players can jump into five teams of three to battle each other over a prize and "engage, evade, exploit, and steal their way to victory." The game's debut trailer shows off some fast-pasted action, but to see everything for yourself,&nbsp;you can check out the trailer below.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true" src="https://players.brightcove.net/694940074001/rydylbNsz_default/index.html?videoId=6308341635112"></iframe>

<p>The story envisions a world in which the billionaires have finally made it to mars, destroying Earth in the process. However, the rich get nostalgic for their former planet's culture. So, they send out ships to collect plunder from the remnants of Earth's poor survivors. Not content to take this sitting down, the Hyenas are fighting back.</p>

<p>The game is still in early development, so the creators have not revealed the release date, but we do know the game is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Though it's still a ways off, you can sign up for Hyenas' alpha today, and you can learn much more about the title in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QjB7dWWhro" target="_blank"><em>IGN</em>'s Summer of Gaming</a> interview-filled stream.&nbsp;</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Who are you going to call?
Indie publisher Digerati has announced that DreadOut 2, the sequel to cult streaming favorite DreadOut, will be bringing its ghostly goings-on to PlayStation and Xbox platforms in July, following on from its initial release on PC way back in 2020.
https://youtu.be/EjkwgcI5hNI
DreadOut 2, much like the 2014 original, is a scare-heavy survival horror title developed by studio Digital Happiness. A third-person action-adventure, DreadOut 2 tells the tale of hardy schoolgirl "Linda Meillinda," (holy shit), who must use her psychic ghost-whispering powers to uncover and banish an army of spooky spirits that are haunting her town. Much like the popular Fatal Frame series, Linda is aided in her efforts by her camera... though the Camera Obscura here is replaced by... a smartphone.
Explore Ms. Mellinda's hometown, speak to members of both the living and the dead, take on an array of side-quests, venture into dark, desolate, and disquieting corners, or just take a literal hammer to the bonce of the undead. Keep your proton pack, Spengler. DreadOut 2 expands upon the original game with a tighter focus on both exploration and combat, but is still jam-packed with terrifying monstrosities and more than a fistful of jump scares. While it's no Resident Evil, it will certainly fit the bill for those looking for a few ghoulish scenarios on a tired evening.
DreadOut 2 launches July 15 on Xbox platforms, with PlayStation to follow on July 20, priced at around $20. It is available to purchase right now for PC via Steam.

Although there's been bits and bobs of news surrounding, famed game researcher Liam Robertson has provided what can be considered the definitive word: even speaking to the development team to get an update.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Silver Fox
Surprise! Turns out that Nexon is still not done revealing characters for its upcoming fighter DNF Duel, which is literally less than six days away from launch. Today's DNF Duel trailer introduces us to the Lost Warrior, who carries with him the undeniable presence and physical aura of a potential boss character.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqaHE0JwIJ8
The Lost Warrior, as you can see in the video above, carries himself with the visual appearance of primordial times, but with a fighting style and mastery of magic beyond his years, suggesting that he may be capable of visiting multiple worlds and eras. Lost Warrior commands the battleground with devastating large strikes, reminiscent of King of Fighters' Rugal. The silver fox is also capable of switching positions with his opponent and rounds off the battle by repeatedly slamming his foe into handy nearby mountains. Ouch.
Lost Warrior is, officially, the final character to join the DNF Duel launch roster, which now totals 16 distinct and unique fighters. I'm still pretty much at a loss for who I'm gonna be digging into, but Enchantress and Inquisitor are both pretty solid calls for me. I hope to share my findings on Nexon's underdog fighter with you all soon. In the meantime, maybe check out the previous trailers for Berserker, Grappler, Hitman, Inquisitor, Striker, Ranger, Dragon Knight, Vanguard, Kunoichi, Crusader, Ghostblade, Launcher, Troubleshooter, Swift Master, and Enchantress.
DNF Duel launches on PlayStation and PC platforms June 28.

        <updated>2022-06-22T18:00:28.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Make war for nostalgia's sake
Sega unveiled the new game it had previously teased today, and it's a bit out of left field. Hyenas is a new sci-fi FPS from Creative Assembly, where players compete to steal and plunder caches of merch for the rich.
The premiere arrives as part of IGN's Summer of Gaming, and was teased yesterday with a little sound bite.
Hyenas pits packs of players against each other in a bid to steal some merch. Old pop culture collectibles have become priceless artifacts in this world, so the goal is to plunder more memorabilia than the other crews and get them out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0694XcFmI7M
It looks like Hyenas is really leaning into the pop culture and "irreverent" tone, as creative director Charlie Bewsher describes in a post-premiere interview. Zero-G movement and combat also look to play a factor. Each playable Hyena also has unique abilities, to cater to whatever playstyle you'd want.
Scraps of nostalgia
Hyenas really looks to be another entry in the Tarkov-influenced extraction shooter genre. We've seen plenty of these, from Rainbow Six Extraction to Battlefield 2042's Hazard Zone.
What seems to be setting Hyenas apart is the tone itself. It's taking a bright and brazen approach that feels right in line with the likes of Borderlands. That, plus hoards full of nostalgic loot and references, like the Nixon mask and a Rubik's Cube.
Creative Assembly has made some stellar games, including Alien: Isolation and the Total War games, but I can't really say I'm sold on Hyenas just yet. It will have a chance to prove itself ahead of its 2023 launch though. Sign-ups for the Alpha Test are live right now over on the game's website.
Otherwise, Hyenas is aiming to launch in 2023 for PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, and PS5.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The PC gets four more toggles
Capcom has announced that the Monster Hunter Rise camera system is getting upgraded when Sunbreak arrives, on both Switch and PC. The catch? PC users will be getting even more enhancements.
Here's a breakdown of the features found on the game's official Twitter account.
https://twitter.com/monsterhunter/status/1539211771004821505
Here's what the Switch Monster Hunter Rise camera upgrades look like (visible here):
The ability to hide the UI
A face [the] camera option
A face [the] camera with buddies option
Here's what the PC camera upgrades look like (visible here):
The ability to hide the UI
A face [the] camera option
A face [the] camera with buddies option
Depth of field toggles (DOF)
A focus option
Blur range
Filter swaps
Folks are already celebrating the hilarious nature in which the NPCs and the player character "face the camera." Once you hit the option it forces them, seemingly against their will, to slowly turn and look at the screen. Others are loving the "face the camera with buddies" toggle — and as someone who laboriously attempted to set up tons of "face the camera" pictures on my own without the help of an instant click, I can relate.
Again, these features will arrive with the launch of Sunbreak on June 30.

Studio DICE has stated that it intends to entirely focus its efforts on the beleaguered Battlefield franchise going forward, eschewing new IPs and alternate franchises such as the studio's cult series Mirror's Edge while it ensures Battlefield 2042 becomes the team's core release.
Speaking in her first interview since taking the role, DICE's new General Manager Rebecka Coutaz told GamesIndustry.biz that the Battlefield franchise was the now core focus of the studio. In particular, Coutaz notes that DICE is committed to its long-term plans for blah shooter Battlefield 2042, with support expected to roll out for another three years at the very least. Asked about whether this meant Mirror's Edge or any other projects were off-the-table, Coutaz was very clear about DICE's directio…]]></summary>

      <p>Believe it or not, The Callisto Protocol is a scary game. But it’s not enough to simply have horrifying monsters and an oppressive atmosphere; developer Striking Distance believes it’s how you arrange these elements. And it does so through a process the team dubs "horror engineering." </p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I got a hands off look at Oxenfree II: Lost Signals, my analysis was that it looked a lot like Oxenfree and therefore if you liked Oxenfree you would like this. I have now played through a small bit of the game, a slightly extended version of the area I saw in the hands off preview, and my analysis is... largely the same.
I know that's very boring, but it's also positive, isn't it? Oxenfree was good, and Oxenfree II looks to be doing those same things that made Oxenfree good. A 2D, side-on supernatural thriller with radios. Good thing remains good! In a world where sequels to beloved media seem to only get progressively worse, I'll happily take it (especially since this one is a Netflix-published project now). And although it's directly related to the first game, the characters and happenings in Oxenfree II are distinct enough that it's going to be accessible if you're new to the series. And even if you did play the first game, it's possible that Oxenfree II will be more thrilling and unsettling to you now, five years later.

      <p>The Callisto Protocol comes from the minds that spawned the Dead Space franchise, and it has more than a little in common with Isaac Clarke’s horrifying adventures. That isn’t to say it doesn’t have plenty of original ideas, but there are several mechanical, narrative, and visual nods that fans of EA’s premier horror franchise will recognize. Here are the biggest overlaps between the two. </p>

The filing, made last year and published this past week, describes a head-mounted display with a rear housing, and the mechanisms by which that display could be adjusted. It's not thrilling stuff - but it is further confirmation that Valve continue to work on designs for VR hardware.

It conjures a mental image of a kid’s TV show where some, possibly sentai-style, superheroes learn about the importance of spelling and grammar. Maybe a little punctuation, as a treat. SpellForce the video game series isn’t that; it’s a trio of RPG-RTS hybrids which, by the time you read this, will have had a new entry announced in the form of SpellForce: Conquest Of Eo. It’s a fresh, turn-based take on the series which casts the player as a wizard attempting to further their mastery of magic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since The Cycle: Frontier is having its second (???) launch tomorrow, June 22nd, I thought I’d knock together a performance and settings guide to mark the occasion. This would involve, as they always do, a bunch of benchmark tests: repeatable runs through a specific area or sequence that would give an accurate indication of how different settings and hardware affect performance. In most games these are either quick and easy or time-consuming and easy, but not The Cycle: Frontier. Oh no.


See, without a dedicated benchmarking tool, running these kinds of tests requires a certain controllable environment, where variables are known and parameters can be reset in a click. This is not the case for The Cycle: Frontier, whose environment is usually trying to fucking kill you, particularly though the unavoidable presence of other players. I’ve never sat down to record some average FPS values only to spend half my time cowering behind a tree, fearful of being shot, robbed and – worst of all – forced to start work over again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday I wrote about eco-strategy game Terra Nil’s demo, which went gangbusters during last week’s Steam Next Fest and shot up into the top 50 most played games on Valve’s storefront. Well, turns out that might be at least partly down to a practice called badge-farming. That’s according to industry pundit Simon Carless’ latest GameDiscoverCo newsletter, anyway.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, you went and flubbed a Reservoir Dogs type of deal, and now you’re a dead’un. As if that wasn’t bad enough, it turns out that Heaven is a corrupt bureaucracy that’s absolutely stuffed with shadowy demons and talking cats. Those demons become your problem when god decides to give you a chance to earn your place in Heaven by committing murder - stylish, speedrunning, parkouring demon murder. It’s perdition with extra steps, then, but is it any fun? Dear reader, Neon White kicks ass.
The game opens with an extremely anime narrative sequence and we’re introduced to the lovable (and less so) doofuses we’ll be shooting up paradise with. This is where most folks will stop and squee at the fact that player character Neon White is voiced by the incomparable Steve Blum, perhaps known best for his role as sonorous space cowboy Spike Spiegel in Cowboy Bebop. White is joined by his fellow demon-slaying Neons including Yellow (best boy), Violet (sucks), Red (mysterious), and Green (bad guy).

      <p>Darth Vader was apparently sick and tired of being trapped in Fortnite's Battle Pass and is now waging war against all players. In a new update to the battle royale game, the Sith Lord is unleashed and he won't hesitate to take you down, but if you can take him out first, you'll get his lightsaber as a reward.</p>

<p>Vader appears in random places each match but is easy to locate since he arrives at the island at the same time as the players. When you are in the Battle Bus, look for an Imperial Shuttle. It'll enter the airspace just above the clouds and will quickly descend to a spot on the map. The Shuttle is highlighted with a blue glow for a few seconds after settling down on the surface.</p>

<p>Vader is one of the toughest bosses in the game and will take some serious firepower to take out. He's also flanked by two stormtroopers. He uses the Force in a variety of ways to mess with you and can block your shots. Your best bet is to attack him from afar with a sniper rifle or approach in a group.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His lightsaber is a game-changer. You too can block shots with it, and it can also be thrown a decent distance to inflict big damage. Of course, you can swing it widely for melee strikes. We don't know how long Vader will be around or how he is influencing the story, but it's awesome to see him on the island dishing out punishment. Here's hoping more Star Wars integration is on the way soon!</p>]]></summary>

Don’t worry if you already own the game on Steam though, because you’ll still have access through Valve’s launcher. Here’s some bouncy Free For All update gameplay in the trailer below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week Intel published a “quick start guide” for their upcoming Arc A-series graphics cards, including a “Supported Hardware Configurations” section that only specifically namechecked their own 10th, 11th and 12th Gen Core CPUs. Cue a heady mix of confusion and perturbation – surely Intel weren’t suggesting that Arc GPUs would only function when paired with an Intel CPU, and a relatively new one at that?


No, they weren’t, though the guide’s vague wording isn’t doing it – and worse, potential Arc users – any favours. Parts of the guide appear to conflate support for Resizable BAR with support for the Arc A-series in general, which further muddies things as Resizable BAR works on AMD Ryzen chips as well as those three Core CPU generations. I asked Intel directly for clarification and essentially, Arc GPUs won’t have such super specific CPU requirements just to run - though they’ll apparently perform better in systems that do support Resizable BAR.

Nový Thinkpad pohání ARM SoC Qualcomm Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3 a běží na něm Windows 11 (což nás trápit nemusí). Prozatím jde zjevně o řešení pro nadšence, Lenovo samo upozorňuje, že spektrum aplikací běžících nativně na ARM verzi Windows se teprve rozšiřuje.

These fans come in black without RGB for a stealthy look, can be daisy-chained to make cable management easier and can be controlled via PWM from 200 to 1800RPM. In terms of performance, every review I've found mentions their great value, but they also detail whisper-quiet performance at low RPMs.

Unfortunately, I ended up playing it a little too long, and now I've left myself no time at all to write about why it was so great. Argh. Let me try anyway.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I didn't get to play as much at Steam Next Fest this weekend as I usually do, partly because I just ran out of time, and partly because the time I did have I spent playing Necrosmith. There were some demos I was meant to play for, like, actual work, and then I ran into a puzzle wall or a bug or something so I just fired up Necrosmith again.
Necrosmith is a 2D necromance 'em up that is also sort of a tower defence game. In the middle of the map is your evil lair, the Hall Of Bones, a sort of legally distinct Sauron's tower that gets more flying buttresses the more you upgrade it. If enemies (which can be packs of wolves or flying bugs or all manner of things) do enough damage to destroy it, you lose - so that's your defense bit. For the towers bit, you have to imagine that the towers can move on their own, and also that they're shambling undead monsters made from a jigsaw of different limbs you find, like an army of very unhygenic Mr Potato Heads.

      <p>Let’s rock, baby! Season 6 of Video Gameography gets stylish as we examine the Devil May Cry series! Over the next few weeks, we’ll be covering the history and lore of Capcom’s premiere action franchise. This week we go all the way to hell with Dante as we unpack the mysterious low-point in the series, Devil May Cry 2.</p>

      <p>Nerf, the leading&nbsp;foam dart and water weapon manufacturer, has unveiled its first-ever mascot, which fittingly goes by the name Murph. Murph&nbsp;Nerfington (I gave them the last name) will represent the company as part of a multi-year marketing push in social media, public events,&nbsp;and more.</p>

<p>Murph looks like a Koosh mascot more than a Nerf representative, although that would still be under the Hasbro umbrella. However,&nbsp;if you look closely, you can see Murph is made entirely out of foam Nerf darts. The new character was created in association with a…]]></summary>

      <p>A new <em>Game of Thrones</em> series is reportedly in the works, and it will reunite fans with Jon Snow after the events of the show’s finale.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/game-of-thrones-jon-snow-spinoff-1235167415/" target="_blank">The Hollywood Reporter</a></em> states that HBO has begun developing the live-action spin-off series, reporting that Kit Harrington is attached to reprise his role as Jon Snow should it proceed.&nbsp;HBO and Kit Harrington’s representatives did not respond to <em>THR</em>’s request for comment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fans last saw the character in the Season 8 finale, which saw him venture beyond the Wall after being exiled from Westeros. A follow-up story would, presumably, center on Jon’s new life with the Wildlings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another <em>Game of Thrones</em> spin-off, the prequel show&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/gamer-culture/2022/03/30/game-of-thrones-prequel-series-house-of-the-dragon-premieres-in-august" target="_blank">House of the Dragon</a></em>, is set to premiere on HBO Max on August 21. That series focuses on House Targaryen 200 years before the original show. It's far from the only TV show in the pipeline based on George R.R. Martin's best-selling series. Other adjacent projects, such as <em>10,000 Ships</em>, <em>The Golden Empire</em>, <em>9 Voyages</em>, and <em>Dunk and Egg</em>, are in various stages of development.&nbsp;</p>

I mean there's a Nacon showcase in July but, I mean come on now, we can't start classing events that occur outside of June as being part of the event formerly known as E3 can we? That would be preposterous. Before long it would spool out across the entire year, absorbing every month until E3 is a constant series of video events that could happen at any point. Do you want to live in a world where Geoff Keighley

You just never know what you might find, with some becoming the best thing since cubed diamonds and others getting left in a state of endless early-access jank. Partly to help you all avoid the duds and partly to satisfy my own morbid curiosity, I trawled through this Summer's Steam Next Fest demo list to test out a bunch. As you might expect, I got subjected to some chugging framerates and a bit of body horror, but also found some great multiplayer shooting in Dysterra and terrific tile-placement in Above Snakes, which might just become a new personal favourite.

He went with DMC. But that punchfest has been out for years so...? Yes! Capcom last night announced Dragon's Dogma 2, following a nice presentation where the devs reminisced about making the first game.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in November, the Wall Street Journal reported that Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick was aware of some allegations of sexual misconduct among the company’s staff but did not inform the board of directors. Well, Activision Blizzard’s board issued a statement yesterday saying that "an objective review" from external advisors "determined the Board never intentionally ignored or attempted to downplay the instances of gender harassment that occurred and were reported”, and that there is no evidence "suggesting any attempt by any senior executive or employee to conceal information from the Board."
In fact, another, separate review of data concludes that "there was no widespread harassment, pattern or practice of harassment, or systemic harassment at Activision Blizzard or at any of its business units" in the United States between September 1st, 2016 and December 31st, 2021. Indeed, "based on the volume of reports, the amount of misconduct reflected is comparatively low for a company the size of Activision Blizzard."

First up, Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade leaves Epic exclusivity to steer its motorbike onto Steam today. Steam Deck compatibility was touted too, you lucky beggars.


Then, after much faffing with mobile games and memorabilia, producer Yoshinori Kitase revealed footage from the second part of Remake, now known as Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. Kitase also confirmed that the Final Fantasy VII Remake saga might actually be completed in our lifetimes, thanks to Square Enix deciding to draw it to a close with a third, as yet untitled part. Gawp at Sephiroth’s broad shoulders from behind by watching the trailer below.

      <p>Square Enix not only revealed Final Fantasy VII’s second game, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/06/16/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-remakes-second-chapter-arrives-next-winter" target="_blank">Rebirth</a>, during today's 25th Anniversary presentation.&nbsp;It also answered a question fans have asked since this whole thing started: how many games does the saga consist of?</p>

<p>It turns out the answer is three. Executive producer Yoshinori Kitase confirmed that there’s only one untitled game left after Rebirth launches next year. Following a three-game roadmap is fitting given that the original Final Fantasy VII consisted of three discs on PS1. Kitase, unsurprisingly, did not give a window for when the final game will arrive.</p>

      <p>At long last, the second chapter of Final Fantasy VII Remake was revealed during today’s 25th anniversary stream. It’s called Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and it launches next winter, or towards the end of 2023,&nbsp;for PlayStation 5.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A cinematic trailer provided tantalizing glimpses of what’s to come, most notably gameplay of Cloud and Sephiroth exploring a section of the world together. While that may very well be a flashback, those who played Remake know that anything is possible at this point. Today's video also confirmed that Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is the second entry in what&nbsp;will be a three-game series.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Grab a pizza slice, kick back, and watch us take on the Foot Clan in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge! Tribute Games and Dotemu’s throwback to the classic TMNT brawlers is out today, and a group of <em>Game Informer</em> editors will tackle the game live on <strong>Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central.</strong></p>

<p>Shredder’s Revenge is a new adventure inspired by the 1987 TMNT cartoon. Up to six players team up to battle over a dozen stages to fold Shredder’s evil schemes. If you’re a fan of brawlers, Shedder’s Revenge hits all the right notes. In my 8.75 out of 10 review, which you can read <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-shredders-revenge/old-school-thrills-new-school-polish" target="_blank">here</a>, I described the game as a “polished, raucously fun throwback that plays better than how I remember the original games.”</p>

First, Capcom released a free update for Resident Evils 2, 3 and 7 Biohazard which introduced ray tracing and higher framerates. Unfortunately, the update also broke every existing mod for those games, with no quick fix available.

All's well that ends well, though. In response to "overwhelming community response", Capcom have made the previous versions of the games available again, so that those wishing to use mods can roll back if they wish.

Admittedly, "world record" is less impressive when only developers and media have played, and I expect to be toppled soon after it launches today. Point is: while writing this post about how much I adore the speedrunning FPS, several times I've had ideas about how I might make that record time even faster, so I've stopped writing, dropped into Neon White for a few minutes, and come back out with a new record. I adore this game, and I might never finish this post.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My biggest question about Starship Troopers Colon Terran Command was what tone it would strike. The RTS potential for an interplanetary ground war against overwhelming swarms of giant not-insects is obvious enough. But the dual spirit of most Paul Verhoeven films is a major reason that The Extraordinary Lust Of Dizzy (working title: Starship Troopers) still holds up 25 years on.


Terran Command understands that. Certainly it nods to the satire here and there, but mostly it focuses on the shooting and desperate defences and evacuations instead. This was the right decision. Though it's a little short on narrative flavour, unless you're really into exploring the setting, it's got enough tactical heft to make up for it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DDR5 RAM arrived late last year, but it's taken until now to see the first semi-reasonable prices for a kit of next-generation memory. CCL are currently selling a kit of Crucial DDR5-4800 for £89.94, more than £30 cheaper than the same kit is on Amazon. 
This is the first time I've seen a DDR5 kit of any description under £100, so if you're considering a 12th-gen Intel (or AMD Ryzen 7000) build, then this might be just what you need.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge, a sidescrolling beat ‘em up that aims to recapture the spirit of the TMNT arcade games from decades past, is both incredibly simple and a breath of fresh air. It’s a basic button-mashing affair that offers nothing new, but that facilitated a good old chinwag that I didn't know I needed.
It was something I really appreciate, when my go-to multiplayer games, such as Warzone and Destiny 2, demand my constant and unwavering attention. Lasting about three hours, Shredder’s Revenge won’t become your new time sink, but it’s an undemanding arcadey jaunt that you can enjoy while munching on pizza with pals. Or, ya know, over Discord while everyone is surrounded by takeaway tubs in their bedrooms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[V Rising, the vampiric survival base builder and surprise hit of 2022 so far, has just got freshly minted Steam Deck Playable status - courtesy of an update to the Deck’s Proton compatibility software. As per Valve’s changelog for the Proton 7.0-3 update, V Rising is among several games (including Age of Chivalry and the original Vermintide) to gain sufficient compatibility with the Steam Deck for the second-highest rating of their review programme, just short of Verified.


Technically, V Rising has been lowercase P-playable on the Steam Deck since late May, when these software improvements appeared on the ‘Bleeding Edge’ branch of Proton Experimental. Now, though, the update has graduated to the main, stable Proton branch, so you don’t have to risk the potential wonkiness of a work-in-progress. I’ve given V Rising a try on the Steam Deck and it does indeed work, though it’s quick to show why it only got Playable status and not Verified.

Rogue Traders, the stars of the setting, are themselves a touch more colourful than your average corpse-emperor enjoyer; freelance explorers given a ship, a packed lunch, and a cohort of space-toughs, and sent off to explore the far-flung reaches of the galaxy. And it’s this unique place in the 40k universe that makes them such an exciting prospect for the setting's first fully-fledged classic CRPG.

That's a heck of a deal for an RTX and DLSS-capable graphics card, especially given the GPUs come with a six month warranty from the folks at Laptop Outlet. This Zotac card will run rings around the GTX 1660 Super, the best card you could buy new for this price, especially in games that support DLSS to boost frame-rates.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft followed up this weekend's not-E3 Xbox showcase tonight with an extended look at a handful of the games shown. That mostly involved middle aged men in jeans talking through their marketing bulletpoints, but there were also a couple of new announcements in between. One of them was that co-op survival-me-do Valheim is heading to PC Game Pass this autumn.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin's Creed: Valhalla is getting a second year of post-release support. Included on the roadmap is a new free game mode inspired by roguelites. Called The Forgotten Saga, it has Eivor battling against waves of enemies in Niflheim, and try-die-repeating in order to attain unlocks which persist between runs. You'll find a trailer for it below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It should be a rule that any game which shows a slick, edited trailer at E3 (or not-E3) has to then release a longer, more illustrative piece of footage, too. That way we'll be able to take our dose of hype, then follow it with a dash of reality. 

So it is with Outpost, a first-person base-builder with seemingly massive swarms that impressed during the Future Games Show. How does it look in the 8 minutes of playtest footage below? Less impressive - but still compelling.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few days ago I sat in on a presentation for Lightyear Frontier, a 3D farming and crafting game set on a remote planet at the edge of the galaxy. In fact in the presentation the game was referred to as a "farmadventure", which isn't a portmanteau and you only have to go another centimetere along to get farmventure, which is just about a portmanteau and, furthermore, is fun to say. 
Developers Frame Break are keen to emphasise how chilled out Lightyear Frontier is: it's very peaceful, and there's no death (a "survival game without survival"). It's all about ecology and being one with nature. This does, at times, feel slightly at odds with the other eye-catching thing about Lightyear Frontier, which is a bloody massive tractor mech stomping about everywhere.

        <link href="https://www.scummvm.org/news/20220605/"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few months have passed since we released ScummVM 2.5.1.
No matter if you expect the scorching heat of the upcoming summer or freezing blizzards in winter (depending on your favorite hemisphere): it’s release time again!
Our lovely developers added support, yet again, for a bunch of new ancient games that require testing:
Sanitarium
Hades Challenge
Marvel Comics Spider-Man: The Sinister Six
The 11th Hour
Clandestiny
Tender Loving Care (CD-ROM Editions)
Uncle Henry's Playhouse
Wetlands
Chewy: Esc from F5
Besides these games, we’d appreciate it if you could check our release testing list - maybe you’ll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long.
And since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we’ve seen quite a bunch of changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.
The AGOS, SCI and SCUMM engine received some really extensive modifications which make all games using those engines very good testing targets as well.
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
Thank you very much for your support!
