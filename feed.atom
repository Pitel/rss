        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thanks to the Covert Dock 2 and ShadowCast 2.
We were already very fond of the Genki: Covert Dock when it was released back in 2020. This portable Switch dock made gaming on the go that bit easier, and was later compacted into an even tinier model in 2021. Now, developer Human Things is back with a new Kickstarter campaign, introducing an improved portable dock, a new way to play Switch games on your iPad or laptop, and a handy device for streaming and content creation.
Dubbed The Alpine Collection, this latest Kickstarter introduces upgraded models to some of Human Things' most popular creations: the Covert Dock 2, ShadowCast 2 and ShadowCast 2 Pro. Beginning with the most Switch-y of the newly-announced products, the Covert Dock 2 is a two-in-one charger and dock much like the Genki portable predecessors, though this one packs in 50% more power than the original model while still being 10x smaller than the standard Switch dock and charger. It also comes with 4K support, which is a nice touch for boosting that resolution.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On the latest-but-one revision of their About page, Metacritic describe the process of calculating a videogame's aggregate "Metascore" as a kind of "magic". The FAQ cheekily invites you to "peek behind the curtain", evoking the figure of the theatre conjurer beckoning the audience on-stage to inspect the props, before performing the trick. You're only shown so much, however. There are tables for conversions between different review scoring systems, demonstrating how a B- becomes 67/100, but the "weighting" Metacritic gives to each source publication when producing the combined Metascore is a closely-guarded mystery.
You could argue that the secrecy is necessary to avoid heavily weighted publications being targeted and pestered by fans to deliver positive reviews of forthcoming games, so as to swing the average (though in practice, Metascore soothsayers have long since sussed out which outlets have the most votes). But I think it's better understood as a mixture of basic trademark protection and a mechanism of enchantment, a means of both deterring imitators and keeping avid readers guessing about the output. After all, no professional magician seriously wants to give away how the trick is performed, much as no meat magnate wants to show you the inside of a sausage factory.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CD Projekt RED has issued an apology, after it was discovered the Ukrainian localization of Cyberpunk 2077 includes a remarkably comprehensive array of anti-Russian references. These range from prominently featured graffiti all the way to niche terminology that will largely be unfamiliar to anyone not from Ukraine or the surrounding countries.


These sentiments are notably not prevalent throughout all versions of Cyberpunk 2077. These were found in the Ukrainian localization of Cyberpunk 2077, which recently went live alongside the 2.0 update. The job was given to the Ukrainian company SBT Localization, per the game's credits. It's also worth noting that CDPR has been vocal about the war in the past, taking actions that include halting sales in Russia.

The Payday series has always entertained using a mixture of competing gameplay mechanics. Going from an engaging yet sometimes confusing heist-based simulation to a chaotic Left 4 Dead-inspired shooter, each title presented a wildly shifting mission structure that encouraged cooperative play. Payday 3 doesn't reinvent the wheel, as it offers many of the same core concepts found in the previous games. That said, some smart design choices and its fresh coat of paint help elevate it above this popular series' previous iterations.

It's painted with hues of desert orange and "Arabian Nights" blue skies, something intentional, according to artistic director Jean-Luc Sala. 
Having lived in the region, Sala says he and his visual team infused many sights he remembers near the Tigris River to bring Baghdad to life.

In case you missed it, the Ukrainian script and menu localisation currently includes a number of antagonistic references to Russians and to the on-going Russian invasion of Ukraine. One dialogue line refers to a particular bandit group as "rusnia", and there's photo mode menu text for a squatting character that translates as "like a Russian". There's also lore text that apparently riffs on Ukrainian government rhetoric during the war, and a piece of in-game wallart that alludes to the dispute between Ukraine and Russia over Crimea.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With all of the Souls series marketing blitzes, it's easy to forget that yes, From Software produced and released Sekiro, and it ruled. Well, it's cleaned up quite a bit and managed to achieve the milestone of 10 million units sold worldwide as of September 26, 2023.


Here's the full announcement directly from the game's official website, roughly translated to English:



"From its release in March 2019 to today, we have received tremendous support from everyone, and we have now surpassed 10 million units sold worldwide. We would like to express our sincere gratitude to everyone who played this work."




I hope that in 20 years, people remember Sekiro


The last website update for Sekiro was back in May of 2023 when From Software made folks aware that there would be temporary online maintenance. Since then it's quietly lived on in the hearts of many; including folks who wistfully still haven't beaten that final boss yet.


It's not in the headlines nearly as often as Elden Ring, which is a cultural phenomenon at this point, and it's arguably less accessible. But it's also one of my favorite games of this generation, packed to the brim with tense boss fights, interesting locales, and a kickass action system.


You can find a used copy for roughly $30, and I highly recommend you give it a chance if you have a penchant for action games. There are a lot of similarities to From Software's Souls moneymaker to be sure, but it's also one of the most unique games they've crafted to date, and it shows almost immediately.

The Steam release will share data with the mobile version.



Ever Crisis on mobile is a free-to-play game with microtransactions and curvy, colourful chibi-style visuals. It's Final Fantasy: Polly Pocket Edition, sort of. Play breaks down into missions with turn-based battles and brief narrative sequences. The idea is that you can pack in a few minutes of Cloud gaming (no, not that kind) while waiting for your tube. But how will that formula square up on PC, and what to make of the game's reportedly very aggressive microtransaction pop-ups? Fingers crossed they'll rebadge it as a standard pay-upfront release and tear out all the gacha.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cyberpunk 2077's first DLC, Phantom Liberty, officially releases today. Since the game has been regarded favorably (thanks to post-launch updates), many have been looking forward to new content. However, some may not be impressed by what developer CD Projekt Red has done in preparation.


In a post on Twitter, the studio announced that, in time for Phantom Liberty's launch, the team has decided to disable mods for Cyberpunk 2077. 




According to the post, this is to "prevent issues with the game that are caused by mods before they receive their update from the modding community." It's an act of precaution and not a permanent move. At the time of writing, there's no indication of when the studio will re-enable them.


CDPR keeps a watchful eye


While some will understand CDPR's decision, others will be a little peeved that mods temporarily lost their official support. For now, at least.


This is also not the first time the Polish developer has maintained a presence in the modding community. Back in December 2022, the studio posted on its forum regarding the then-upcoming "next-gen" release of The Witcher 3.


It seemed that many were concerned that mods would not work correctly for the upgraded version of the RPG. However, CDPR released a list of popular mods that it had personally checked, outlining which ones would be compatible with the update.


Hopefully, it won't be long before the developer does turn mods on again for Cyberpunk 2077. A lot of PC gamers have grown accustomed to playing improved, non-vanilla versions of games, so they won't want to stick with the base experience for too long.

The studio dropped a couple of posts recently on Twitter/X. One of them mentions the new edition of the Murkoff Collections comic. This is then followed by the announcement that a new update for The Outlast Trials is imminent.




While details are scarce at the minute, Red Barrels did wish to respond to questions by outlining some of the things you can look forward to. We'll be seeing a new trial map, some additional variators and cosmetics, as well as a new mini-game for the lobby. Plus more.


Console editions on the way


If that wasn't enough, a further post says the team has been "working on getting Trials on PS5, Xbox S/X, and older gen (PS4/Xbox One)", and PC crossplay. It's looking like the studio is looking to achieve this by early 2024.


As for the Outlast Trials update, we're not quite sure when that's going to start rolling out. However, given the time of year, it wouldn't be too surprising to see it aim for a Halloween launch or thereabouts.


The developer also says that the company has now hit 50 employees, which means there may be some more goodies on the way for the early access of the newest Outlast entry. Hopefully, we'll have more word on that in the near future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a year of critically acclaimed games, Final Fantasy 7: Ever Crisis is certifiably a mobile title that came out. Billed as “another possibility for a remake,” Square Enix hyped up the game's PSX Final Fantasy nostalgia while kind of hiding the fact that it was, in fact, just a gacha game. For presumably that reason, many Final Fantasy fans vocalized their wish to see Ever Crisis on PC and consoles, and it looks like they’ll get some of what they asked for.


Square Enix announced via social media that a Steam version of Final Fantasy 7: Ever Crisis is in development. While details are sparse, we do have confirmation that data will transfer between mobile and PC versions of the game. Otherwise, we don’t have much to go off of here. Square Enix hosted a live stream that showed a shot of Cl…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[El Paso, Elsewhere feels like the cancelled shooter PS2 adaptation of an incredibly short-lived Image Comics horror series from the mid-90s, leaked by a disgruntled developer over Google Drive more than a decade after the fact. It’s something that would have had a six episode animated series, broadcast out of order at 1am. It’s a testament to that moment in pop culture where the coolest thing imaginable was a tortured guy in a trenchcoat, holding a gun in each hand and fighting monsters. Whether you regard this aesthetic with respect or disgust will help you determine whether there’s anything here for you.

The developer is largely known for their bizarre titles like An Airport for Aliens Currently Run by Dogs and Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator. They’re games that feel like a big middle finger to the mainstream. I wasn’t expecting to see a game from them that pays respect to an old standard.


Yet, El Paso, Elsewhere has been in development for a while. And while its gameplay is rather conventional, there’s a lot more here than meets the eye.

After being announced for Hong Kong last month, it has today been revealed that Pokémon Scarlet and Violet's DLC, The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero, will be landing a full international physical release on 3rd November.
The news was shared to Twitter by Nintendo, revealing that the physical copy will contain the current version of the game (with The Teal Mask DLC) and will require an update once the second part of the DLC, The Indigo Disk, is released — remember, we still don't have a release for that one yet. So, a physical DLC cart... without all of the DLC on it? Makes sense, we suppose.

Its writing is hilarious, its art is simple but gorgeous, and its gameplay scratches my exploring/collecting itch in a way that’s supremely satisfying.


Dave the Diver was developed and published by Mintrocket, a brand-new subdivision of Nexon. Though Dave the Diver is the first game from Mintrocket, Nexon has a long history of mostly free-to-play online games like Maplestory and Blue Archive. Dave the Diver is neither free-to-play nor online though, and it offers a complete experience for the price of the box.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A vibrant and violent volume.
A few years ago, Nippon Ichi produced Disgaea 6: Defiance of Destiny, a new entry in the long-running series that aimed to shake up series conventions by introducing auto-battling and transitioning to a 3D art style. Not all the changes it brought were positively received, but fortunately, the game sold well enough to not only keep the lights on at the company but to also justify the development of a proper successor to address those criticisms.
Director Shunsuke Minowa said that one of the team's main goals with Disgaea 7: Vows of the Virtueless was to go with a “back to basics” approach, and that was absolutely the right call. Disgaea 7 feels like the ultimate distillation of the Disgaea experience, successfully merging the innovations of 6 with many of the traditions of earlier games, all while throwing in some worthwhile new ideas of its own. It’s an incredibly compelling new entry, and we can’t recommend it enough to any strategy RPG fans out there.

Over the online store Fanatical (thanks, PCGamesN), you can get discounts on a selection of Bethesda-owned titles. The sale gives you the opportunity to build a custom bundle out of a possible 14 games, choosing up to five releases for as little as $3.


Screenshot via Destructoid.


While it's not a huge selection, there's a fair range to opt for. You could get classic Fallout combined with Rage or go for some of the modern Doom or Wolfenstein releases. It also looks like many of them come with their respective DLCs and expansions as well, so it has that extra appeal.


Only two games actually by Bethesda


Of course, given that Bethesda is a powerful publisher as well, you'll notice that the majority of these games haven't been developed by the studio itself. Still, it shows just how much sway the studio has in the AAA market, and you can still choose Morrowind and Oblivion for your bundle.


It also looks like the sale event at Fanatical is going to be going on for a while. At the time of writing, the countdown clock at the top of the page says there are just over 16 days and 18 hours until the deals end. That'll take us right into the middle of October. At that point, I imagine the Halloween sale events will start kicking in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been greatly looking forward to Fortune's Run, despite absolutely sucking at the demo. Scandalously, we don't appear to have covered this indie sci-fi FPS on these golden pages, so here's a quick overview: you're the high-jumping, sword-wielding, bullet-pumping lovechild of Deus Ex and DOOM, galloping through a world that recalls the Imperial bases and sewers of Dark Forces, taking down grungy pixelart sprites by means of precision parries, grabs, combos, headshots, terrain traps and much more besides. Between dust-ups, you can play basketball and leave crayon graffiti for other players care of a Dark Souls-style messaging system. It's a feast!


The game was due to launch into Steam early access tomorrow, 27th September, but unfortunately, there's been a delay. Valve's testers have denied Fortune's Run approval to launch on the platform. Among the reasons, according to developer Team Fortune themselves, is that Valve don't feel the game's content warning for sexual assault is actually necessary.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony is no stranger to having its private data leaked, sometimes to the detriment of its customers. The company may be in trouble again, as a group called Ransomed.vc claims to have compromised all of Sony's systems. 


The group also claims that Sony has refused to pay, and it is therefore attempting to sell the data it has retrieved. Despite the shady activities, Ransomed.vc is attempting to appear as a legitimate business that offers penetration testing and is compliant with GDPR and data privacy laws.


Cyber Security Connect first reported the story, and it claims that the group has been "operating since September, despite some links to previous forums and groups." No price is given for the data, but there is a "post date" of September 28, which could be when the data is leaked. 


According to Cyber Security Connect, some evidence is given but it is not particularly compelling. It features "screenshots of an internal log-in page, an internal PowerPoint presentation outlining test bench details, and a number of Java files." Sony has yet to comment on any hacks or data compromises. 


If Sony has been compromised, it won't be the only gaming company to suddenly find its private matters in the public. Recently, through what seems like a bit of clumsiness on Microsoft's part, plenty of Xbox's plans were leaked.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've read several comments here and elsewhere that Bethesda's Starfield is "a mile-wide but deep as a puddle", or variations on that theme. Said commenters might be tickled to know that there is, in fact, a puddle in the game's Akila City that contains infinite loot: by dint of peering into it, you'll magically gain access to a nearby store's inventory. Strip the shelves, then wait a day or two, and you'll be able to do so again, forever and ever. Or at least, that was the case till this week's Starfield patch, a small update consisting of exactly ten bulletpoints, including one that tackles "an issue that allowed for a vendor's full inventory to be accessible". Boo! Time to go looking for another convenient in-game metaphor, I guess. Perhaps there's something incredibly clever you can say about all the flying cities.


Before I discuss the flying cities, find the patch notes in full below. Again, this is a smaller update. Bethesda are working on larger patches that include the addition of official Starfield mod support - tentatively dated to arrive next year.

He's got slightly below-average speed but can drop food to go into a crazed sugar frenzy, giving him an extreme case of the zoomies. Garfield can also bring out his "old school shine" to reflect projectiles. You can get the full rundown in the video above.

In response to this, a group of Star Wars loving Switch fans in the US have banded together to launch a class action lawsuit against Aspyr and the game's publisher Saber Interactive. The case 'Malachi Mickelonis v. Aspyr Media, Inc. et al' was filed in July - requesting a jury trial, with the defendants required to respond by 4th October.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The 3DS housed no shortage of RPGs, ranging from beloved classics to esoteric oddities. While titles in that second category can be easily forgotten, sometimes games just need a second chance in a new market. Case in point, NISA has announced an HD remaster of The Legend of Legacy will hit modern consoles in early 2024.




The Legacy of The Legend of Legacy


For those who originally missed this one, The Legend of Legacy is an interesting case. Developed by FuRyu, The Legend of Legacy featured several names that worked on Square Enix’s Final Fantasy and SaGa series, including Kyoji Koizumi and Masato Kato. And just like the SaGa series, the game proved to be an acquired taste. Destructoid alumni Kyle MacGregor Burleson scored this a mere 4.5 back in 2015, citing the game’s repetitive combat and rigid progression systems. The similar art style to the acclaimed Bravely Default likely drew unintended comparisons as well.


However, also like the SaGa series, The Legend of Legacy did attract its share of fans. And for those who like what this RPG is selling, this rerelease should hopefully be a pleasant surprise. As of writing, no gameplay changes have been confirmed for this HD version of the game. However, it certainly looks prettier than its original 3DS incarnation, I’ll give it that.

I never played this one back in the day, and I have no clue if I’d find time to get around to it next year. Not when I have 500 hours of The Legend of Heroes games to play, at least. But for those who did enjoy this one, I hope the remaster delivers.


The Legend of Legacy HD Remastered will release in early 2024 for the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Baldur's Gate 3 cast can be summed up as an eclectic cast of weirdos forcibly brought together by fate. Despite their constant life-or-death situations, they find time to bicker and form deep friendships. The idea describes many RPG casts, but Baldur's Gate 3's cast also fits as sitcom characters.


A fan named Sho seemed to think so also and recreated the Friends intro using the cast. It honestly works even if the concept is absurd. 




Sho captures the main cast's varying quirks within a light-hearted 45-second edit using the Friends theme.  If I looked at this from an outsider's perspective, I could tell that someone like Lae'zel is confident and bratty, while Astarion is sass personified as an elf. 


Word about this clip spread enough that both Baldur's Gate 3's developers and voice actors saw it and complimented the clip. Another top comment complimented Sho for including Lae'zel rolling her eyes, something I agree was amazing to include. 


Baldur's Gate 3 works as many things, and it works as a sitcom. Players are always finding odd and hilarious moments that sell it as a comedy even if it tackles some heavy subjects.


This is to say that a sitcom edit for Baldur's Gate 3 fits surprisingly well. Fans grow attached to the various fun and lovable characters, something that both describes the game and the best sitcoms on TV. 


Both also follow the said lovable cast as each member grows and solidifies a group bond along with individual relationships. Canned laughter is really all Baldur's Gate 3 needs to sell itself as a sitcom in a fantasy setting.

Timespinner 2: Unwoven Dream looks to bring more Symphony of the Night inspired exploration to consoles and PC. Specific platforms beyond Steam are still TBD along with a release date. In the meantime, you can get yourself acquainted with the new entry in the announcement trailer. 




According to the official site, Timespinner 2 is set after the events of the first game. Players should expect to see some familiar faces returning along with new characters in the interconnected realm known as Surflynd. In addition to Symphony of the Night—which the previous entry took inspiration from while carving its own niche—this Metroidvania aims to pay homage to other '90s classics. Jeff Ball is once again composing the soundtrack that serves as the backdrop to some beautiful pixel art.

Back into the fray with Timespinner 2


Timespinner 2 has players taking control of Auria, a retired war hero. After her son runs away to prove himself as the hero destined to prevent the collapse of reality, Auria heads out to save him. Along the way she'll use magical orbs to protect those she loves and fight to discover the truth behind cataclysmic prophecies. 


Along with the reveal, character designer and illustrator Absolum shared character portraits for the sequel:




The first Timespinner was crowdfunded via Kickstarter and released on September 25, 2018. It's available on PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PC, Mac, and Linux.

Lunar Ray Games, the developer behind the beautiful pixel art Metroidvania Timespinner, has announced that it's developing a sequel (thanks, Gematsu!). A release date hasn't been announced, but hopefully, we'll see it sometime next year.
Timespinner 2: Unwoven Dream is coming to Steam and unspecified consoles, but given that the original tile came to Switch in 2019 (just a year after the PS4 and PC version), it's fairly likely this will see the light of day on Switch — or perhaps Nintendo's next console. The sequel takes place "after the events of Timespinner" according to the game's official website but stars a new protagonist in Auria who — like Lunais from the first game — can wield powerful orbs of magic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hideki Kamiya, one of the founders of PlatinumGames and the creative mind behind Bayonetta, Devil May Cry, and the Viewtiful Joe series is leaving the studio he helped create, according to a post on Twitter made by Kamiya and one made by PlatinumGames. Kamiya’s resignation is effective October 12.




“We are truly grateful for [Kamiya’s] creative ideas, leadership, and contribution to the growth of PlatinumGames from our start-up to this very day,” said the Bayonetta and Nier: Automata developer in a post on Twitter. It goes on to wish Kamiya success “in his future endeavors as a game creator.”




In a post made to his personal Twitter account, Kamiya elaborated on his decision to leave Platinum, saying “this came after a lot of consideration based on my own beliefs. and was by no means an easy decision to make,” while also confirming in a reply that he will continue to create “in my Hideki Kamiya way.” This, plus the studio’s well wishes, seem to suggest that Kamiya will continue creating games.


Kamiya has become notorious on Twitter for his liberal use of the block button, making it very clear that, among other reasons, responding to him in any language other than Japanese would earn an insta-block. 


Kamiya’s career began with Capcom, where he served as a system planner for the original BIOHAZARD, known in the west as Resident Evil. He then went on to become the chief game designer and director for the sequel, BIOHAZARD 2 / Resident Evil 2. Kamiya, Viewtiful Joe producer Atsushi Inaba, and the creator of Resident Evil Shinji Mikami would create Seeds in 2006, the studio that would merge with Tatsuya Minami's Odd Inc. to form PlatinumGames in 2007. It was there where Kamiya would work on titles such as Bayonetta, The Wonderful 101, and Astral Chain.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I remember the days when my wallet was mostly safe, with a Steam Sale only occurring a few times per year. Now it feels like there's at least a sale per month. I guess any opportunity to save money is a good thing, but it's getting hard not to add more games to my ever-growing unplayed Steam library.


Today begins the Steam SHMUP Fest, a festival that specifically focuses on the shoot 'em up genre. As part of the fest, some landmark titles in the genre are heavily discounted as well as a few newly released titles. Also, several games in the genre have dropped playable demos as part of the festival. For those interested in free digital stuff, Steam users can claim a free reward each day for logging in. I'm not sure if the rewards are static or random. I got a sticker. The event is live now and will end on October 2 at 1 p.m. ET.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developer announces cancellation.
Back in 2021 we were excited to see that the Wipeout-style sci-fi racer BallisticNG would be speeding onto Switch in the future. Well, a couple of years down the line, developer Neognosis has announced that the Switch port is now cancelled as a result of last week's controversial policy changes from Unity (thanks, VGC).
As a brief recap, Unity last week announced plans for a 'Runtime Fee' policy, which would effectively charge development studios each time a game made using the Unity engine was installed. This was met with instant backlash, of which BallisticNG's Switch port cancellation is but one example, and the plans were later changed in the aftermath.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In just shy of a month, we’ll be able to jump into the Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1, which brings Metal Gear Solid, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, and Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater — as well as the original Metal Gear, Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake, and Snake’s Revenge — to Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series, and PC.


But, now we know what frame rate each of the Metal Gear Solid titles will have, and it says a lot about the experience fans of the series can expect with this collection.


Image via Konami


To start, the original Metal Gear Solid will run at a consistent 1920x1080, 30 fps across the gamut of consoles, except for the handheld mode on the Nintendo Switch, which will run at 1280x720, 30 fps. 


When it comes to Metal Gear Solid 2 and Metal Gear Solid 3, they’ll run at a semi-consistent 1920x1080, 60 fps on all consoles except for — big surprise — the Switch, where it’ll run at 1280x720, 30 fps in handheld mode and 1920x1080, 30 fps in docked mode.


The chart does make it clear that the versions included in the Master Collection “have been up-converted to display at these resolutions.” But it seems like the HD Collection versions of Metal Gear Solid 2 and Metal Gear Solid 3 are what we're getting here, so if you have played those versions, you have some idea of what to expect in the Master Collection.

We’ve seen both of these girls before. Furina is the Hydro Archon and she’s played a prominent role in the Archon Quests so far. Charlotte made her debut as an NPC back in Version 3.7. With this announcement though, they are both confirmed to be joining the playable roster soon.


What do we know about Furina and Charlotte?


Furina is a charismatic drama queen. She’s the ruler of Fontaine and her people adore her. Despite her popularity though, the flavor text included with her announcement hints that she might actually be a bit lonely.…]]></summary>

When Nintendo surprised its community with the release of F-Zero 99 on Nintendo Switch Online, we honestly weren't quite expecting it to be as good as it is. And yet, demonstrating a clever twist on the classic SNES title, it wound up being what we'd argue is the best of the '99' range on Switch, calling it a "brilliant take" in our review.
Now that the game has been out for nearly two weeks, we suspect that many of you have honed your racing skills considerably and have maybe even snatched 1st place on the odd occasion. We'd love to know for sure though, and it seems Nintendo itself does too.

I haven't touched Cyberpunk since release in 2020, and I'm sort of intrigued to discover that the female-presenting version of the protagonist, voiced by Cherami Leigh, has become the default for marketing purposes.

        <link href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/minekos-night-market-review"/>
        <updated>2023-09-25T16:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[About a third of the way through Mineko's Night Market, a young boy dressed as a fish says to his octopus-chopping father, "What? I just thought sending the local errand kid on missions was how people acquired stuff on this island." To many, this will simply be a comic jibe at what you, the aforementioned local errand kid, have been doing for the last eight hours or so. After moving to this rural backwater with your dad in search of a better life, you quickly realise that no one in this town ever gets off their arse to get anything done.
Instead, it's up to you, Mineko, to fulfil every last one of their desires, whether it's collecting 50 bits of wood so they can construct a frame for their new house (before asking you for 50 bits of paper to give it some flimsy-looking walls), buying and delivering them a sports drink they could have easily got themselves from the local shop, or crafting a flower box for them because, well, they asked you to. As I said, industry isn't exactly their strong suit here, and you'd be forgiven for wondering how any of them functioned as human beings before you arrived.
But this line of dialogue also strikes right at the heart of what a joyless experience Mineko's Night Market is. It reveals the cold, lifeless husk beneath its lovely visuals. It's nothing but 'Me, me, me' and 'Take, take, take' in this game, and NPCs offer nothing in return except soul-crushing tedium and a long list of repetitive chores. Animal Crossing this is not, my friends, so don't be fooled. This is about as far from 'cosy' and 'cute' as you can possibly get - and that's despite it having dozens of pet-able cats.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty is, according to our reviewer Graham, "perhaps the best expansion pack ever made." Feh, small potatoes – Phantom Liberty’s most prestigious achievement is surely how it heralds a new ray tracing feature that makes Cyberpunk 2077 look and run a tiny bit better. On specific settings. And only on GeForce RTX graphics cards. The more expensive ones.
Hello, then, to DLSS 3.5 and its Ray Reconstruction component. Like how DLSS improves visuals and performance with AI-aided upscaling and ant-aliasing, Ray Reconstruction injects some machine learning cleverness into the rendering of ray tracing. Nvidia say Ray Reconstruction cleans up artefacts and reduces the performance impact of RT effects, and judging by how it works in Cyberpunk 2077, I’d say they’re correct – with the caveat that all its enhancements are, ultimately, modest.

Because it exists," the developer's vice-president of marketing Lisa Pendse has revealed in a new interview from this year's Tokyo Game Show. "It's just not ready. It's simmering." Hmm.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a rough weekend of server instability and matchmaking problems, Payday 3 publisher Starbreeze Entertainment has issued a public statement about what went wrong that might just cheer players up a bit. In an apparent attempt to staunch the flow of blood from the near-mortal wounds inflicted by server issues, Starbreeze has done what any right-minded company would do and implied that it was somebody else's fault. 


The statement opens with a blunt admittance of the main issues, stating that "matchmaking infrastructure has not performed as tested and expected," apparently due to a massive influx of players. This is likely true, as with Payday 3 appearing on Microsoft's Game Pass service and having recently made a big deal about getting rid of Denuvo, it does make sense that demand would…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hypnospace Outlaw used to be a very different type of game than the one we know today. The authentic replica of the world wide web circa 1999 was originally designed to be little more than ornate level select screens in a stylish endless runner-style game, for example, providing extra context for your adventures pursuing "outlaws on the Hypnospace Highway". 
Games change during development, of course, and it’s not unusual for once substantial ideas to be left on the cutting room floor. But seeing as Hypnospace Outlaw is our pick for the RPS Game Club this month, I wanted to reach out to the game’s creator Jay Tholen to ask some questions about these unlikely origins, its influences and its lasting legacy. What happened to the Hypnospace Highway? And what comes next for the world of Hypnospace?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Theorizing over potential and real acquisition deals remains top of mind in the games industry, thanks in no small part to Microsoft's pending buyout of Activision Blizzard. It's easy to forget that not every large gaming publisher is looking to get acquired in the first place. Capcom, for one, recently noted that its active strategy is to remain independent, even though it's open to more collaborative projects should the opportunity arise. 


In a Bloomberg interview with Capcom, COO Haruhiro Tsujimoto explained:  "I would gracefully decline the [acquisition] offer because I believe it would be better if we were equal partners." 


Though Bloomberg's question posed reference to turning away Microsoft, specifically, it is curious that Tsujimoto didn't necessarily single out the tech giant. Instead, the COO spoke broadly in his commentary. In other words, a Sony acquisition is equally out of the picture from the looks of it.




Capcom isn't for sale, says COO


As one of the most popular and widely acclaimed gaming companies in the industry right now, Capcom enjoys a position of prestige in most respects. With Resident Evil, Monster Hunter, and Street Fighter franchises in tow - just to list a few - Capcom has been riding a high for years now. The company's success doesn't seem likely to wane anytime soon, either, with titles such as Dragon's Dogma 2 already on the horizon.


If there's any major publisher poised to tell Microsoft no, then, Capcom is seemingly the one. Perhaps that's good news for fans of Capcom's output over the last several years. The company was able to not only find its footing but also maintained quality output over numerous releases. Having an umbrella third party meddling in things could dampen that success in some way, shape, or form. And from Tsujimoto's comments, it seems he feels the same way, too.

According to Capcom, the eighth installment in the Resident Evil series will release for iPhone and iPad on October 30. This continues the long-standing tradition of releasing horror media during the spookiest time of the year.

As for which devices it'll be on, it'll be compatible with iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max. Any iPad Air and iPad Pro that has the M1 chip or later can run Resident Evil Village as well. According to a report from Gematsu (which cites screenshots from Capcom's TGS appearance), the game will be priced at 4,990 yen (around $33), while the "Winter's Expansion" will be 2,000 yen (approximately $13).


Additionally, a Mac version of Resident Evil Village is available now.


Resident Evil 4 coming at some point


As well as that, iPhones and iPads will also feature the remake of Resident Evil 4 at some point. At the time of writing, we only know this version of the Remake will arrive this year. The App store listing says it's expected to release on December 31, though the description clarifies this is a placeholder.


Both RE games are coming to Apple devices as the tech giant moves towards products that have the processing power to handle AAA games. If you're after an iPhone 15 Max or 15 Pro Max but you're not into horror, you may also be interested to learn that Assassin's Creed Mirage is coming to the phone in 2024.

It turns out the Ukrainian version is awash with references to Russia's on-going invasion of Ukraine, all of it seemingly in support of the latter. The news comes via Zone of Games, who have published a few side-by-side comparisons from the game's files, underlining differences between the English and Ukrainian translations in various bits of dialogue and menu text.
I asked the organisers of Indie Cup - a Kyiv, Ukraine-based digital festival of games like Pahris Entertainment's upcoming Space Wreck - to help me double-check the Ukrainian version's alterations. The Indie Cup team's Arsenii Tarasov was happy to oblige, and also volunteered a few further examples of more... adventurous localisation from his own research, supported with screenshots.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following a particularly fun and delightful bug from the week prior, Destiny 2 was recently beset by something far less entertaining: a possible DDoS attack from an unknown source. According to player reports on Reddit and other Destiny 2 community hotspots, the game has been suffering from a wide array of connectivity issues both minor and major, up until the point that the whole thing became wholly unplayable for a period of time.


The problems have been so pervasive that players faced issues in all of Destiny 2's game modes, from the Trials of Osiris all the way to the humble Lost Sector missions. PvE enemies have been unresponsive to attacks, while rounds of PvP would wrap up in a tie no matter what, leading to widespread confusion and understandable annoyance with the state of the game.




Did someone DDoS Destiny 2 over the weekend?


Broadly speaking, it doesn't seem like the game is in real long-term trouble. While it's certainly a big pain that the players couldn't enjoy Destiny 2 over the past couple of days, the odds are good that Bungie already has a handle on the problems. Most seem to be able to jump into Destiny 2 just fine already, and while that's no guarantee that there won't be further issues down the line, it is a good sign, regardless.


This latest batch of problems, notably, might not have been Bungie's fault after all. While the developer is yet to chime in on anything relating to these issues in an official capacity, some believe that the whole mess is the handiwork of an angry hacker, no less. It goes without saying that this entire story ought to be taken with a pinch of salt, as there's no actual evidence of any sort to corroborate it. At the same time, there is, indeed, a possibility that the theory crafting going on in the featured Reddit thread is correct, which would be a heck of a development all on its own.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Okay, okay, now that Starfield has been out for a bit, we've had a chance to properly formulate an opinion on it. While it's generally regarded as a fantastic game, it still has its faults and room for improvement, and one modder definitely felt it needed better visuals.


As spotted by DSO Gaming, Nexus Mods user Halk Hogan PL recently released their "HD Reworked Project" for Starfield. This is essentially a texture pack that gives the Bethesda RPG some graphical oomph. Using side-by-side comparisons, and a video, you can see the difference in visuals this mod makes.




The creator says that their project "aims to improve the graphics by reworking game assets to better quality preserving original art style and good performance." They also released a similar HD texture pack for The Witcher 3, so this is definitely not their first rodeo.


When the Todd is away, the mods will play


If there was one thing that was certain in the run-up to Starfield's release, it was that modders would be out in force. Indeed, there was already a slew of custom content from the word "go." We've seen DLSS options be added to the game, an attempt to inject a little Star Wars, and more.


Bethesda's long-awaited space-faring title stands well on its own, but the community shows that the work is never done. Even being one of the most successful video game studios in the world, Halk Hogan PL felt that Starfield could stand to be better in terms of graphics.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The digital gaming world has been on the grow for years and while Steam is arguably the head honcho, GOG.com is a worthy alternative. Beginning life in 2008, the PC storefront is currently celebrating its 15th year with a mega sale event that sees hundreds of games being discounted.


If you head over to the GOG website, you can peruse all the games that have had their prices slashed for the celebrations. There's pretty much something for everyone here, whether you want 40% off Cyberpunk 2077, 75% off the GOTY edition of Fallout 3, or some other percent signs attached to some other game.

There's also a blog post that gives a little bit of history about the service, as well as a few facts about the website. For example, did you know you can use the famous Konami code on the homepage?


Intended to preserve PC gaming


Started by CD Projekt around the time it found fame with the Witcher series, Good Old Games was born as a means of digitally distributing PC games. This idea goes back even further – to 1994 – in which the company wanted a way of combating video game piracy in Poland by, as the website itself says, "offering classic games at budget-friendly prices."


As the digital age grew in the 2000s, the likes of GOG.com have become a haven for "forgotten gems." While the company responsible for it would become better known as the developer of AAA games (under the CD Projekt Red brand), its PC gaming storefront is a strong force in the quest to keep classic games in circulation.

Beating The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom without any kind of self-imposed restrictions is no easy task given the sheer amount of content available, but beating it without even visiting the surface of Hyrule? No, surely not, right..?
Well, that's apparently what Reddit user Black_Hand_Gotthard has achieved. As spotted by Polygon, they effectively managed to travel across the various Sky Islands by utilising Zonai Devices like the Glider and custom 'Airbike', rendering any requirement to land on the surface null and void.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hideki Kamiya is leaving Platinum Games next month. Kamiya co-founded the Osaka, Japan-based studio in 2006 and later went on to direct games like Bayonetta and The Wonderful 101. His final day at Platinum will be October 12, according to both a statement released by the studio and Kamiya on his personal Twitter account. 
As for why, neither Platinum's statement nor Kamiya's own tweets indicate a specific reason. Platinum thanks Kamiya for his work while stating it looks forward to seeing what he does next, while Kamiya notes that the decision to leave was not an easy one but he feels it's for the best. 
Here's Platinum's statement:

September 25, 2023
And here's what Kamiya tweeted today about his upcoming departure: 
However, I feel this outcome is for the best.
September 25, 2023
Before co-founding Platinum in February of 2006, Kamiya worked on Capcom's Resident Evil series, helping plan the first game and directing its sequel, as well as its Devil May Cry series. He also directed the first Viewtiful Joe game, and then Okami in 2006 at Capcom's Clover Studio. Capcom closed Clover later that year but Platinum had already been somewhat founded under the name Seeds, Inc. It was later renamed Platinum Games and the rest was history. 
Kamiya departs from Platinum more than 17 years after he founded it alongside Shinji Mikami, who is no longer there and departed from Tango Gameworks earlier this year, and Atsushi Inaba, who is the studio's CEO.
While waiting to learn what Kamiya is up to next, read Game Informer's review of Bayonetta and then check out our thoughts on The Wonderful 101. Read Game Informer's Bayonetta 3 review after that and then read our review of Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon. 
Do you think Kamiya will stay in game development? Let us know in the comments below!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dark Side, the exciting sequel of the groundbreaking Driller, is ready for public testing!
Dark Side, like its predecessor, was released by Incentive Software Limited in 1988, shortly after Driller. The updated gameplay features a jetpack that allows you to leave the ground, providing a new and fresh perspective that emphasizes the excitement and challenges of exploring Tricuspid, the second alien moon of planet Evath.
This time, the vicious Ketars have scattered and hidden Energy Collection Devices (ECD) around their base to destroy your home planet. It’s up to you to destroy them first! The tricky part is many ECDs are connected to each other and can regenerate instantly, so you must figure out the right order to successfully complete your mission. 
Our reimplementation of the Freescape engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Dark Side support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC. Additionally, there are two playable demos if you want to test the game. Support for Amiga and AtariST will be available later! Please contact us if you have some other release.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[God Forgives… I Don’t.
There’s going out on a limb and then there’s blind faith, and while the Bud & Terence games fall into the latter of the two, they are at least a labour of love. If you don’t know — and there’s a good chance you don’t — Bud Spencer and Terence Hill were a movie duo popularised in the '60s and '70s for their slapstick adventures and at-odds physical profiles. Born in Italy as Mario Girotti and Carlo Pedersoli, they started out in gag-laden spaghetti westerns before changing their names for the Western market, dubbed over successfully enough to build up a large fan following.
They’re an odd fit for a modern video game, not least because a large proportion of the market will have no knowledge of their work. At the same time, Trinity Team’s beat 'em up is imbued with such a fantastic sense of spirit, fun, and adventure, that even the uninitiated will find it endearing.

Since its release last week, the internet has been ablaze with comparisons between Mortal Kombat 1 on the Switch and next-gen consoles. Things look rough, and now the good folk at Digital Foundry have released their technical analysis to tell us just how rough. Spoiler: it's bad.
So, let's take a look at this technical rundown, shall we? In order to save on download size and get the massive game running on Nintendo's comparatively smaller hardware, the Switch version drops the bit-rate and resolution of story mode cutscenes as well as the fights themselves. Digital Foundry revealed that the game runs at 756p in docked mode and 720p in handheld, with severe visual cutbacks including those uncanny missing mouth and eye animations that we are sure you all will have seen online.

With Microsoft's gargantuan acquisition of Activision-Blizzard nearing its close after the UK's CMA provisionally approved the revised deal, many are wondering who might be next on the tech corporation's shopping list (and no, it's probably not Nintendo).
Indeed, one prime target for acquisition at the moment might well be Resident Evil and Monster Hunter developer Capcom, but it doesn't appear as though the company is interested in being bought out. In an interview with Bloomberg, Capcom's COO Haruhiro Tsujimoto was asked what the company's position would be if Microsoft were to approach it with an acquisition offer. Here's what Tsujimoto had to say:

It's once again time to get a look at the list of physical game sales in the UK, it has been a really rather big one for new releases — in fact, of the top 10, four are brand-new physicals.
It is Mortal Kombat 1 that has come out on top this time to land the number one spot in its debut week — no thanks to the dreadful Switch port, of course, which only accounted for 7% of the game's overall sales (79% came on PS5 and 14% on Xbox Series S|X). Lies of P has also sold well in its opening week, as the latest Soulslike takes third place behind Hogwarts Legacy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unity have announced that they're making changes to their "runtime fee" in response to overwhelming negative feedback. The key changes are that the fees no longer apply to developers using Unity Personal, and will only apply to developers using Unity Pro or Unity Enterprise who upgrade the next version of Unity which ships in 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dragon's Dogma was the action-RPG for people who wanted to play alone, but didn't want to feel alone. By far its most charming feature was the Pawn system, whereby you'd create an AI-controlled sidekick and hire two others, shared online by other players, to accompany you on your journey through a fantasy wilderness of tumbledown castles and goblin campfires. Pawns make dependable companions in many respects - pinning enemies for you to tag-team kill, healing or resurrecting you, opening chests you've missed, and enchanting your weapons at the outset of each skirmish. But what makes them fun to be around is that they're a bunch of massive buffoons. 


Pawns talk without cease as you explore: a steady patter of idle observations about well-wrought staircases and the local fish trade, advice about the bestiary and, in the case of Pawns recruited from other players, quest tips based on time in their own worlds - all of it couched in the game's quirky faux-medieval dialect. Pawn dialogue is highly context-sensitive, and very often, nonsensical. They'll climb into fountains and complain that they're wet, and launch into pithy descriptions of monsters even as they're set on fire. It ought to be maddening, but somehow, it never is - probably because the Pawns never actually attempt to be witty like ally characters in, say, Xenoblade Chronicles. They're resolutely straight foils in a realm of lions with snakes for tails, chaotic boulder traps, unpleasantly lusty ogres, and players who push the wrong buttons and make random decisions on the fly. Well, pawns are back in Dragon's Dogma 2, which I recently played an hour of, and they're chattier than ever.

While some of the interview with Rowan touched on the overall design process at Riot Forge, most of the focus was on the upcoming Song of Nunu: A League of Legends Story. I have to admit I had expected the interview to be rather straightforward. Based on what I had seen from the trailers for Song of Nunu so far, I thought I knew what was in store. A cozy and playful lighthearted adventure through the Freljord as Nunu, with Willump and Braum by my side. Surely there'd be some laughs, some gaffes, and maybe even a guffaw or two. 


As my questioning began, Rowan was quick to remind me: Song of Nunu is being developed by Tequila Works, a developer well known for their hard-hitting narratives …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Sega Genesis didn’t technically get Valis II. Instead, it got the remake of the first Valis and Valis III. However, between these two games was a title that remained exclusive to the platform, and that was the bizarrely named Syd of Valis. The Japanese title makes more sense. It’s SD Valis, named such because it uses a “super deformed” anime art style, which might be better known in the West as “Chibi.”


Why? Fucked if I know.


Syd of Valis is presumably a play on the whole “SD” thing, but then the game goes on to refer to Yuko, the protagonist, as Syd, while the manual and box cover do not.


So, anyway, that’s a great start. Syd of Valis tells the same story as Valis II, but with smaller characters, essentially. And with a dumber name.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stardew Valley remains among the most beloved indie games of the past decade, and its content updates over the years help maintain its popularity. Developer ConcernedApe fuels the farming fanfare with additions both big and small, and it looks like he's teasing another. 


The newest of these teases is an image of a parrot on top of a blue perch. It's a cute picture, but the bird's demand for money and capital J on the perch implies there's more to it.




Fans noted these features and ascribed them to Jojamart, the supermarket chain that works as Stardew Valley's antagonist. Blue is the company's primary color and is transparently greedy just as this bird seems to be. 


Stardew Valley's farm-hungry community also noted the tropical setting, leading some to speculate that Joja reached Ginger Island. Some assume Jojamart expanded into Ginger Island, so its reach goes beyond Pelican Town. Others speculate that the parrot is an upcoming incentive for players to pursue working with Jojamart.


Whatever the answer is, ConcernedApe is keeping mum about the situation. Whether it's for Stardew Valley's 1.6 updates or screenshots from the upcoming Haunted Chocolatier, any context given is often vague.


It's an effective way to stir up Stardew chatter, as fans get a look into an upcoming project only to have more questions than answers. I'm among them, so I eat these teasers up while coming up with my own wild theories. 


Part of me gets annoyed these teasers have no elaboration, but it also adds to the fun of wondering. Whatever the answer is, a parrot demanding money from players fits right in with all of Stardew Valley's oddities. As for when we'll see the bird, no one knows for now. Stardew Valley version 1.6 doesn't have a release date yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With Mortal Kombat 1 on the horizon, we're revisiting the entry that set the series on its current trajectory: 2011's Mortal Kombat (aka MK 9). Join us today on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. Central as we take a bloody journey through the game's genre-defining story campaign. Episodes will be uploaded to our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel the following Saturday morning. 
After 2006's Mortal Kombat: Armageddon seemingly concluded the franchise's main narrative, 2011's entry picked up the bloody pieces. It moved the saga forward by resetting the timeline, serving as a soft reboot that brought Mortal Kombat back to its 2D fighting roots and ushering in the return of the classic roster. MK 9's cinematic story mode served as an epiphany for the series and fighting games as a whole, establishing the blueprint for narrative fighting campaigns still utilized today. MK9's story also serves as the first chapter of the modern trilogy of games that Mortal Kombat 1 builds upon. For a whole lot more on MK9 and its development, you can read this feature on how the reboot saved the franchise.
Join editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they battle their way through MK 9 to see how its reimagined tournament holds up. 
Part 1 - Surpr-iced! 
Part 2 - Bringing The Smoke
Part 3 - Staff Meeting

It's also an incredibly cool 2D beat 'em up that is, at its best, comfortably the best I can think of. But the boundaries between the two are too frustrating to make it the legend it ought to be.
It's a sequel to The Friends Of Ringo Ishikawa, a game I didn't really vibe with. FA is much improved, a sort of pared down Yakuza game about beating rival gangsters up in between story bits about an ageing Maruyama trying to get the band back together after leaving prison and apparently not caring that he's dying. I do recommend it, but be prepared for some friction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you enjoy tower defence, video games presented as fake PC desktop environments, and big sexy mouths in Hell, cast your innumerable unblinking eyes over Heretic's Fork. The deck-building tower defence game casts you as an employee of Hell tasked with punishing sinners by building towers and deploying troops using a demonic computer system. I've played a few hours since Heretic's Fork launched yesterday and while it hasn't quite enraptured my hellbound heart, I am enjoying figuring it out—and seeing what my paperclip helper will do next.

You see, I'd hoped Starfield's side quests would be a bit more fun than collecting magic space rocks. But basically every side hustle I've tackled have all been the equivalents of early MMO fodder and I'm so tired of them.

Even among Elden Ring’s cast of bastard-hard bosses, the Goddess of Rot distinguishes herself as an ender of lives, a relentless steel tempest that has shredded the most prepared and dextrous of adventurers. She’s also been beaten, rather soundly, by a man using only his mouth.

Or, to be more precise, a QuadStick FPS, a specialised game controller comprised of a mouth-operated joystick and several 'sip and puff' switches. It’s the favoured tool of professional streamer and Guinness World Record holder Rocky "RockyNoHands" Stoutenburgh, who in 2022 used it to become the first quadriplegic Elden Ring player to claim Malenia’s scalp. This was a win for a QuadStick as well: a showcase of how adaptive hardware and clever controller design could make games more accessible than ever, enabling players with disabilities to match and exceed the heroics of their able-bodied peers. And yet, there’s little sense – among disabled players, advocacy groups, or even controller manufacturers – that accessible hardware is entering its golden age. While major breakthroughs have been made, high prices and commercial concerns still carry the threat of willing, eager players being left behind.

Hard lines against hard drive installations are new to PC games, but it was only a couple of weeks ago when Starfield showed the dangers of crossing them. Broken audio, regular freeze-ups, load times so long you could measure them with a calendar...  an SSD really is the only way to play Starfield, and it sounded like Cyberpunk 2077 would follow suit. "We advise against running the game on an HDD (or on a SD card on Steam Deck) due to lower bandwidth which may cause new content to not stream properly," reads CD Projekt Red’s 2.0 patch notes. That’s us told.

Payday is exactly the sort of online multiplayer I can get behind: PvE with clear but theoretically malleable goals (theft!). But although compared to Crime Boss: Rockay City it's a crushing 60st monster truck tyre, Payday 3 isn't really reinventing the Payday 2 wheel. In some respects you might think it's rolling backwards, and while dedicated Payday 2 players may well switch over to the current gen iteration, you get the sense they'll be complaining about things the whole time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tales of the Shire is a cozy new game set in The Lord of the Rings universe and it's coming out sometime next year. Developed by Wētā Workshop, the New Zealand-based special effects and props company that worked on Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings movie trilogy, and published by Private Division, Tales of the Shire promises to let players live their best cozy Hobbit life. 
Private Division revealed little about the game with its announcement yesterday, although it did release a teaser trailer that captures the vibes of living on The Shire. Check out the Tales of the Shire teaser trailer for yourself below: 


"Your cosy Hobbit life awaits in Tales of the Shire, a heart-warming new Lord of the Rings game by Wētā Workshop and Private Division," the teaser's YouTube description reads. "Coming 2024." 
And that's all we know about the game. Here's hoping we learn more soon because it sounds like a great premise. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer's review of The Lord of the Rings: Gollum.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last month, Microsoft submitted a new deal to the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority regulatory agency that proposes Ubisoft get the rights to Activision Blizzard game streaming for 15 years. Microsoft did this to get its acquisition of Activision Blizzard approved by the CMA after the regulator previously blocked it over cloud gaming concerns. One month later, the CMA has granted preliminary approval to Microsoft due to its new Ubisoft deal. 
The CMA says it has "identified limited residual concerns with the new deal" but that Microsoft has put forward remedies (see: Ubisoft's role) that the CMA "has provisionally concluded should address these issues." The CMA is now consulting on those remedies before making a final official decision ahead of the October 18 deadline to do so.

Microsoft attempted to woo the regulator by agreeing to sell Activision Blizzard game cloud streaming rights to Ubisoft, and while the CMA have "limited residual concerns", they've largely accepted Microsoft's modifications.

Alas, it comes too late for the Wood Elf Druid I rolled during my first try at the 1.0 version. I wanted her to look like a sort of Kung Fu Galadriel, with cool tattoos and aerodynamic scars, but she emerged from the character creator looking like she'd been mugged by a packet of demon crayons. I've left my active character, a High Elf Sorceress, safely tattoo-less.

That love has only been amplified by having a kid whose first instinct in any game is to create his own character, unit, level - whatever is available.

The best creative games inspire that creativity by having some innate flavour of their own, though. Some personality that inspires you to lean in, or nudge it in some other direction. By comparison, the new trailer for Everywhere, seems like metaversal porridge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Octopath Traveler II is one of the year’s most celebrated RPGs, and now Xbox fans have been invited to join the party. The game is coming to Microsoft’s consoles and Windows PC early next year.
The RPG was first released to PlayStation consoles, Switch, and PC in February. Octopath Traveler II, like its predecessor, sees players guide eight adventurers across a sprawling adventure in an HD-2D rendered world. Though similar on the surface, the sequel has been praised for its improvements in storytelling, character development, progression, and navigation. 
In our review, we scored Octopath Traveler II an 8.5 out of 10, with guest writer Josh Broadwell writing that “Octopath Traveler II does what an excellent sequel should. Instead of breaking new ground left and right, it improves on the original in nearly every way and feels more confident about the stories it tells.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assassin's Creed Nexus VR hits Meta Quest devices in less than two months on November 16. This release date was revealed in a new gameplay trailer from IGN for Assassin's Creed Nexus VR, which gives us another look at the game's three protagonist assassins: Ezio from Assassin's Creed II, Connor from Assassin's Creed III, and Kassandra from Assassin's Creed Odyssey. 
In the trailer, we get a look at how combat and parkour will work in the game. As expected, given the game is a VR exclusive title, everything happens from a first-person perspective. As Connor, players will explore 18th Century America during the American Revolution. As Ezio, players will parkour through 15th Century Italy during the Italian Renaissance, and as Kassandra, players will fight as a mercenary assassin through ancient Greece. 
Check out the Assassin's Creed Nexus VR gameplay trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Assassin's Creed Nexus VR looks pretty much exactly as you'd expect for an Assassin's Creed game in VR. All the assassin tropes are still there, fortunately, like leaps of faith, hidden blades, parkour, and more. 
Assassin's Creed Nexus VR hits Meta Quest devices on November 16. 
While waiting for its release, check out this Assassin's Creed Nexus VR trailer from June and then read our preview after checking out more of the game earlier this summer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubisoft has announced Tom Clancy's The Division 3 and Massive Entertainment, the Sweden-based company behind the first two Division games and the upcoming Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, is developing it. The studio announced this in a new post on Twitter today, linking to a blog discussing the threequel. In it, Ubisoft reveals that Star Wars Outlaws creative director Julian Gerighty will take over as The Division brand's executive producer once Outlaws ships. 
Gerighty joined The Division team as an associate creative director in 2014. After Massive shipped the first Division game, Gerighty moved onto Tom Clancy's The Division 2 as creative director. As executive producer of the brand, Gerighty will work on The Division 3 and other projects set in The Division universe like Tom Clancy's The…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Baldur's Gate 3 is one of the biggest games of the year, but it launched with its fair share of bugs. Luckily, developer Larian Studios has released two major patches to the game, and while the third was set to release today, it's been delayed to tomorrow. In a post on X, the site formerly known as Twitter, the developers announced the patch would be delayed "to ensure thorough testing." This is likely done to avoid the issue they ran into when they had to roll back a hotfix last month.
While we know the patch has been delayed, before now we didn't have much of an idea of what that patch included. While specific bug fixes are still unknown, Larian tweeted about a new feature to expect tomorrow: the ability to change your character's appearance. This includes details like pronouns, voice actor, and specific facial features, but notably does not allow you to change your race, which could alter the story depending on your choice. 
With Patch 3 comes the Magic Mirror, which lives in your camp and allows you to change your Tav’s appearance whenever you’d like!

Even though the patch plans have been derailed, Baldur's Gate 3 still launches on Mac today, so if you've been meaning to grab it on that platform, now's the chance to do so. We'd highly recommend it, and you can read about why in our glowing review of the game. If you've been playing the game and enjoying it, maybe it's a sign you should try D&D, the game it's based on, as well.]]></summary>

It is, she points out, understandable why the sanitised Bethesda of today would leave well enough alone: "2002's Elder Scrolls game is an overambitious, odd, scrappy, and spiky beast. It is a game happy to leave you lost, confused, misunderstanding, weirded-out, frustrated, and stuck."
Yet, Morrowind is loved! And in the comments of that article Nic Rueben mentioned the demo for Ardenfall, an RPG with no release date but a Steam demo. So off I toddled to have a look, and though I haven't played much of it yet, I'm confident in saying that if you liked Morrowind you should check the demo out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paradox Interactive and new indie team C-Prompt have announced their debut 4X strategy game Millennia, which I got to play for an hour at this year's Gamescom. With development being led by former Irrational Games co-founder Robert Fermier and Age Of Empires II lead designer Ian M Fischer, Millennia will see you attempting that classic quad of Xs across ten distinct historical ages, starting in the Stone Age before eventually ending up in a "post-modern future", designer Ben Friedman tells me. 
The twist here, however, is that you've also got what C-Prompt are calling 'Variant Ages', which let you bend the timeline to your will. Some of these variants are more historical in nature, such as an Age Of Monuments where everyone's building Egyptian pyramids, Friedman explains, while others are more fantastical, with the words steampunk, alchemy and space alien invasions all mentioned in the same sentence. I had a good time with it during my demo, but the real delight was seeing my home army of Kyoto go and invade neighbouring settlement Telford, before going on to conquer Rome - as you do. So if historical melting pots are your kind of 4X jam, read on.

CD Projekt have spent years attempting to address the underlying systemic and workplace issues and claw back some goodwill - hence, the general atmosphere on Xitter of developers needing to take five and stare at a flowerbed for a while. "It was a rough few years but there's finally celebration and closure (for me at least)," posted senior level designer Seb Mcbride.

Announced in September, The Man Who Erased His Name stars longtime Yakuza series protagonist Kazuma Kiryu and focuses on his life after Yakuza 6: The Song of Life before he appears in Infinite Wealth. And now, thanks to Xbox's 2023 Tokyo Game Show broadcast, we know we'll be hanging with Kiryu on Xbox Game Pass on the game's November 9 launch day.
The Man Who Erased His Name will also hit Windows PC as part of Xbox's PC Game Pass program on day one as well. 
Alongside this news, RGG Studio revealed that Like A Dragon: Ishin!, a Yakuza spin-off entry that hit PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3 in 2013 in Japan (but never came to the West), will hit Game Pass later this year on both Xbox and Windows PC. 
While waiting for these games to hit Game Pass, read Game Informer's Like A Dragon: Ishin! review and then check out the latest Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth trailer. After that, read our hands-on preview of Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ellis Tucci grew up playing games like Thief, System Shock, and Deus Ex. Now she's making an immersive sim of her own. It's called Spectra, and it's set in the US in an alt-history 1972 where Soviet Union is the dominant military power after President Roosevelt was deposed in a fascist coup. You play as a Soviet agent tasked with infiltrating and fomenting revolution in a fortress city called Hiwatha.
Tucci wants Spectra to meet the criteria players will expect from an immersive sim. "To me, the immersive sim is the platonic ideal of the video game" she says. "I've tried to deliver on that immersion by creating an environment that is extremely interactable and flexible in the ways it can be used." She explains that "a quite frankly silly proportion of the buildings in each map are enterable and that "you can turn off the lights, set traps, and use things like televisions, radios, or payphones as lures."


It sounds like everything immersive sim fans want. But there's one big difference between Spectra and the games that inspired it. Tucci is making it on her own. And she isn't the only indie developer working in one of the most ambitious, developmentally complex genres in the industry. Games like Shadows Of Doubt, Fallen Aces and Gloomwood are merely the steam rising from the bubbling magma chamber that is indie immersive sim development, Like the recent revival of retro shooters, the indie space is on the verge of an immersive sim eruption.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After the closure of original developers Troika, a long-awaited sequel announcement, delays and layoffs at Hardsuit, a secret change of studio (which led to further layoffs at Hardsuit), preorder refunds and the belated reveal that a developer best known for (very good) non-combat narrative experiences would be taking the reins, the only thing I really want to hear about Vampire: The Masquerade Bloodlines 2 is that it’s definitely, absolutely going to reach the finish line. There are actual vampires that come back from the dead less often. But I'm piqued nonetheless by Chinese Room studio design director Alex Skidmore’s thoughts on how this Seattle-set World of Darkness action-RPG adaptation will differentiate itself from other games in the genre, and especially, how it will put its vampiric premise to use.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Baldur's Gate 3 "no possibility left unpossible" choice-and-consequence train continues with the revelation that, if you break up with a lover in the game, you can slowly repair the relationship and spark a bit of your old chemistry. This might not sound earthshattering to anybody from outside the videogame world - what are you doing here? Run along and watch your silly non-interactive movies and TV shows - but it's quite novel for a fantasy RPG in the BioWare tradition. In my experience, at least, most RPGs only give you the build-up to a character romance, then flash-freeze the relationship post-consummation, perhaps because you've unlocked a sexy "loyalty" companion ability and the developers don't want to take it away from you. Baldur's Gate 3 is one of the few that thinks about how chemistry  might come and go.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After playing Final Fantasy VII Rebirth for the first time (check out my full impressions here), I then spoke with director Naoki Hamaguchi, producer Yoshinori Kitase, and creative director Tetsuya Nomura to seek answers to some burning questions. That includes how much narrative ground Rebirth covers, the decision behind splitting it between two discs, and if there’s any form of data transfer between Remake and Rebirth.
How Did Rebirth's Development Compare To Remake's? 
Rebirth launches on February 29, a couple of months shy of Remake’s fourth anniversary. According to Hamaguchi, Remake’s development cycle was around four years, making the turnaround for Rebirth, a much larger game, seem relatively quick. It’s especially impressive since Square developed and released the PlayStation 5-ex…]]></summary>

Final Fantasy VII Remake felt like the realization of an impossible dream when it launched in 2020. Not only did it feel willed into existence after years of fan requests, but it largely lived up to sky-high expectations based on its generally positive reception. Tack on a good story expansion with the Yuffie-focused Intermission, and the series is riding a wave of momentum into its second chapter, Rebirth. To learn how the sequel is shaping up, I visited Square Enix’s Los Angeles studio to play two slices of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth: a flashback sequence of the ill-fated Mt. Nibel mission and an open-world segment …]]></summary>

According to an early report, a French court authorized the operation in response to a complaint filed by major Hollywood studios, StudioCanal, Apple and Amazon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Prior to joining RPS and coming into a possession of an Actual Contemporary Gaming PC, I did all my gaming on a plucky Erazer laptop from circa 2014. The old warhorse has certainly had some adventures, to the point that it isn't really a laptop anymore but a hovering debris cloud of plastic and metal, constellated by strips of sellotape, from which a moving picture may be hesitantly conjured by means of screamed insults and the careful deployment of desk fans. 


Among the sicker jokes I've played on various editors as a freelancer is to review triple-A games on this sorrowing technological Igor, which - I swear to you - physically flinches and begins to whimper frantically when presented with any game more demanding than Far Cry 2. Thing is, I'm pretty sure I can run Ubisoft's forthcoming Assassin's Creed: Mirage on this hapless relic. The publisher have released minimum and recommended system specs for their latest historical throat-slitter, and they're pretty dang reasonable.

        <updated>2023-09-20T16:14:27.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In an announcement I personally never could have predicted, the 2001 PlayStation 2 Capcom video game Onimusha: Warlords (and subsequent sequels) is getting an anime adaption for Netflix. The reveal is surprising for a number of reasons. The franchise is not one that is particularly well-known or currently popular. Also, the anime seems to have little to do with the original game. Protagonist Samanosuke Akechi does not make an appearance in the trailer. But, like Samanosuke, who was modeled after Japanese actor Kaneshiro Takeshi, the anime's protagonist, Miyamoto Musashi, is modeled after the late Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune. Coincidentally, Onimusha 2's protagonist, Jubei Yagyu, was modeled after Japanese actor Yūsaku Matsuda, who had also passed away well before the game released. It's an odd throughline for the series but is a key element.
The other surprise for the adaptation is it is being co-directed by Takashi Miike. Miike is known for films like Ichi The Killer and Audition, but he also has another big Capcom franchise under his directorial belt with Ace Attorney, a film adaption of the Phoenix Wright games.
I played Onimusha for the first time in earnest when it released on Switch and enjoyed revisiting it and finally beating it. You can find more of my thoughts on that topic here.


The anime premieres November 2 on Netflix.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Farming life sims like Stardew Valley remain enduringly popular, and until Stardew dev ConcernedApe's Haunted Chocolatier arrives, there are plenty other games popping up like cute life sim mushrooms to horn in on our shared desire for a simpler, more rustic way of life. The route to this in Stardew Valley is actually quite hard, requiring mastery of several different interlocked systems that each ask a level of expertise that, on most days, I cannot be arsed to work towards. I love Stardew Valley, to be clear, but I hold no expectation of ever getting the most out of the farm space alloted to you as a result of your grandfather's death.
Fae Farm is a Stardewlike with a fantastical veneer and 3D graphics, but importantly it frontloads progress. It's slightly easier, in ways that seem small but cumulatively mean it takes up way less of your brain's runtime on bad days. For example: all activities, including watering your crops, use less energy than in Stardew Valley. This means you can run around clearing farm space and gathering resources, and have a working plot in just a couple of days. Heck, you can have a pretty full day in the mines before you've mechanised your farm. Game changer!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cyberpunk 2077's triumph was that it offered a sprawling story, dozens of hours long, which cohered around just a small number of themes. Or maybe even a single thesis: that the cynical, defensive, self-centred voice in your head - personified by ancient, soul-trapped, anarcho-rockstar Johnny Silverhand - offered only a literal dead-end, and that real rebellion in the face of a messed-up world lay in helping friends. It was Frank Capra with robot arms and samurai swords, and I ate it up.
V doesn't go to Washington in Phantom Liberty, but Washington comes to her. CD Projekt Red's major expansion to the first-person RPG opens up a new district and a new cast of characters, including the President of the New United States and an aging sleeper spy played by Idris Elba. The themes remain the same, but the thesis is being tested: how can you help your friends if you don't know who they are, and if their goals are mutually exclusive?

Since its disastrous launch in 2020, developer CD Projekt Red has delivered critical updates to Cyberpunk 2077 to align it more closely to the original vision, but Phantom Liberty, coupled with the free Update 2.0, is its biggest yet. This new expansion trades in the high-octane mercenary vibes of Cyberpunk 2077 for a more subdued spy thriller, and offers a well-made trove of new ways to experience Night City. The expansion features a great cast of personalities, all well-performed, even if some are underused. Interacting wi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spencer Yan's My Work Is Not Yet Done is a narrative-driven investigative horror game that combines elements of the survival and simulation genres with a plot exploring "the imbrication and dissolution of human identities/meanings within uncanny wilderness", to quote the project's Github page. It follows the final days of Avery, last surviving member of a doomed hunt for the source of a strange transmission, and sees you performing complex acts of maintenance upon environmental sensors, while picking through journals and other found documents so as to "to discern the most viable 'truth' behind both Avery's mission and the signal itself". 


It's all wrapped up in a dense, warping two-tone aesthetic with shifting naturalistic sounds that makes my breath catch in my chest. I love everything I've seen and heard about Yan's game, but I don't think I've ever done it justice in writing, and I doubt today's efforts will address this. For you see, what I'd like to call your attention to right now is the game's complex recreation of shitting.

        <updated>2023-09-20T14:06:06.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sega and Like a Dragon series developer Ryu Ga Gotoku (RGG) Studio held a presentation this morning sharing all kinds of new details for its upcoming games, Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth and Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name.
First up, it shared a 10-minute story trailer for Infinite Wealth, which shared so many details that I am hesitant to write them all here in fear of spoiling potentially major plot beats in the game. The summary is that Ichiban Kasuga is offered the opportunity to find his mother, which means he must travel to Honolulu, Hawaii. Returning characters make an appearance, Ichiban will apparently be fighting sharks and giant squids, taking part in fun Hawaii activities like surfing, and, expectedly, will be getting into all kinds of trouble with the local gangs. Kazamu Kiryu's role also gets somewhat defined in the trailer.


Some details not in the trailer include the fact that the playable party now has full freedom of movement while fighting, allowing for more strategy. The game includes a Crazy Taxi-inspired minigame, among many other money-making opportunities. Actors Danny Trejo (Machete) and Daniel Dae Kim (Lost) will also be playing Dwight, the leader of the Barracudas gang, and Masataka Ebina, the ruthless captain of the local yakuza syndicate, respectively. You can check out some additional screenshots for the game below.

Alongside the story trailer, there is also a five-minute gameplay trailer.


Arguably, the biggest news from the event, however, is Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth's release date, which isn't far off. The game releases January 26 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, and PC. Preorders for the game will net you the Hero’s Booster Pack, to level up faster, and a Special Job Set that includes the Linebacker and Tennis Ace jobs.
Alongside all the Infinite Wealth details, Sega and RGG also released the full opening cinematic for Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, which you can watch below.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Among the chunkier morsels from yesterday's leak of Microsoft documents is an extended email from Xbox CEO Phil Spencer, dating from 2020, in which he argues that today's largest AAA videogame publishers remain dogged by their "failure" to adapt to the shift from physical to digital videogame distribution, and especially, subscription models such as Microsoft's own Game Pass. This inability to move with the times, Spencer suggests, has created a situation whereby the largest publishers rely on sheer "production scale" to attract and retain customers. 


In turn, this has meant that publishers are unwilling to bet on new IPs - it could be billions down the drain, after all. Instead, "AAA publishers are milking their top franchises but struggling to refill their portfolio of hit franchises", while relying on "rented" IPs such as Star Wars. This is an older email, of course, and there's an obvious element of self-flattery in the shape of Microsoft talking up Game Pass. Still, it's a persuasive account of recent industry history, bolstered by Spencer's notes from conversations with Assassin's Creed outfit Ubisoft and GTA publisher Take-Two Interactive in particular.

Not only is Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth launching on January 24th next year, it's taking Ichiban and co. to the sunny island of Hawaii! Kiryu's back and in a battle with his biggest adversary yet. And you can become an unhinged Pokémon master, among many, many other things. We're so back. We're so effing back.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Development of new content for Evil Dead: The Game has ceased, developer Saber Interactive has announced. The game’s planned Switch version has also been canceled.
In a statement posted to X (formerly known as Twitter), Saber explains that despite only releasing the game last May, it’s effectively moving on from it. Saber doesn't give a reason behind the decision, but states that it still plans to fix any major bugs and will keep the servers running “for the foreseeable future.” Check out its full statement below. 
Evil Dead: The Game is an asymmetrical multiplayer game set within the popular film universe where players control Ash and his friends to survive against a player-controlled Kandarian Demon. We weren’t particularly enamored with the title at launch, with video editor Alex Van Aken scoring the game a 6 out of 10, writing in his review, "It’s incredibly one-sided for a game all about two sides. And it’s majorly unbalanced." You can watch a team of editors tackle the game in this episode of New Gameplay Today.]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-09-19T21:44:35.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this morning, various Xbox and Microsoft documents leaked online: emails, in-development plans, internal details, and more. It's how we learned Xbox head Phil Spencer considered acquiring Nintendo and Warner Bros. Games at one point, that Xbox is planning an Xbox Series X/S refresher for next year, that it might be working on remasters of Fallout 3 and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, and that Microsoft has plans for a next-gen hybrid console in 2028. 
The leaks were quite extensive, and after some online confusion, we learned via Bloomberg that Microsoft accidentally provided federal courts with confidential (and not redacted) documents. Following news of these leaks, Spencer has now addressed what’s happened with a brief statement on Twitter. 
We've seen the conversation around old emails and documents. It is hard to see our team's work shared in this way because so much has changed and there's so much to be excited about right now, and in the future. We will share the real plans when we are ready.
September 19, 2023
He shared that on Twitter, but The Verge has obtained a more in-depth memo sent to Xbox employees. Here it is, in full: 
Something of note, especially for those particularly excited about something that might have leaked today, is that in both the internal memo to Xbox employees and the public-facing statement posted to Twitter, Spencer says these leaked documents and email are old and plans have changed. He also says the team will share "the real plans" when ready. Now, he obviously can't say the leaked information is what's happening and must downplay it as a result, but it's also a reminder to take everything that has come to light with a grain of salt because it's very likely plans have changed.

The past decade of innumerable remasters has been boring enough, but remastering these two games is particularly boring. When even bother when all Bethesda have made since Oblivion is Oblivion remakes with added spacesuits or yelling? Boring. But while I think the torrent of remasters is a miserable sign of big publishers just giving up, if they're going to do it anyway: why not Morrowind?

Scumhead's Franzen - released a few days ago on Steam and Itch - has a couple of big draws, straight off the bat. Firstly and least importantly, it's free, which it really shouldn't be. Secondly and more significantly, it's one of those rare RPG miniatures that is both richly imagined and snappy, with a busy and befuddling world in which you have immediate clear motivations that escalate rapidly and breed Dire Implications. It also looks like a 16-bit Pathologic, so consider me firmly on board.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At first glance, Lies Of P looks like a wannabe Bloodborne reskin, replacing the Gothic edges of Yarnham with a twisted version of a kid's fairytale. There are silhouettes in windows sheltering from an infection that's plagued the populace and puppets who've gone awol. Take damage and you've got a chance to recoup the costs by smacking the baddie back. There's a bit where you platform down a large well, thin planks of wood marking your descent. Survive and you might want to visit your doll-like maiden and spend your souls.
But is Lies Of P just another boring pretender to Bloodborne? No! I think it's worked with its Gothic Pinocchio theme remarkably well, and the option to snap and configure your puppet lad to your liking makes its journey feel distinct. Sure, Lies Of P might lack some of the presence of its main inspiration, and not all of its parts come together to form a cohesive whole, but the game is an undeniable must for Soulslikers who crave the dark. It's perhaps the closest any Soulslike has felt to a FromSoft game, in everything from its presentation to the cadence of your character's jog.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I dunno if you've heard of this game Starfield, but there's a lot of talk about it at the moment. It is a roleplaying experience where the role you play is not "Viking-ish warrior who can shout with the power of a million metal frontmen" or "wasteland wanderer downing cans of irradiated coke" but "person in space following a broadly unexciting A-plot". Much of the most interesting stuff in Starfield is on the periphery of the main story, as is the case with most Bethesda RPGs, but I find Starfield to be much less whimsical (something I won't relitigate here). As an RPG, Starfield is taking itself seriously, and sometimes this collides with the design game systems and menus.
An example of this is that you are supposed to experience the vastness of space, but cannot do so without going through a lot of loading screens. Another is that you have two sets of clothes: a spacesuit for places that are hostile and have no breathable atmosphere, and street clothes for planets that do. And NPCs keep making fun of me for wearing my spacesuit when I don't need to, and I hate them for it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overnight, in what Edwin called an "unredacted document oopsie" related to Microsoft trying to buy ActiBlizz, two things have been revealed that interest me. Well, three. Firstly, Phil Spencer capitalises "Gaming", which I hate. Secondly, as noted in that linked story, Phil Spencer wants to buy Nintendo and, in pitying also-ran brackets, Valve, which has some of the same energy as me walking into an estate agent and demanding a six bedroom house with a new fitted kitchen and a hidden library. And thirdly, according to a release schedule from a presentation dated 2020, Bethesda and Zenimax have planned out their next few years of games in depressing MCU presentation-style. Boy, are the next couple of years going to be whelming.
As is predictable now, it is largely a list of sequels and remasters, many of them dated quite optimistically, it must be said. This document pegs Starfield for 2021, for example, and obviously that didn't happen. There are also two unnamed games on there for this year (Projects Kestrel and Platinum; 2021's Project Hibiki we know refers to the surprise-released Hi-Fi Rush) and it seems unlikely they're going to appear before the end of the year. We know The Elder Scrolls 6 isn't coming for at least another five years. They're going to remaster Oblivion (but not Morrowind, the weird cousin everyone else likes most, but whose parents aren't sure what job to give them in 2023). And they're going to make Dishonored 3. I'm excited about that! But also fearful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft and Xbox appeared in court earlier this year over its $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard. Various previously unseen documents from those court proceedings have leaked, revealing Xbox head Phil Spencer considered acquiring Nintendo and Warner Bros. Games at one point, an Xbox Series X/S refresh and a new Xbox controller planned for 2024, and potential remasters of Fallout 3 and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. Another leaked document details the company's plans for a next-gen hybrid console in 2028, as reported by The Verge.
This document stops short of revealing what the console is, what it could be called, and what it might look like one day. However, it reveals some key details about its architecture and how Xbox views it as a hybrid game platform that uses the cloud…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Readers, I have a confession to make. I might have to stop playing Starfield. Not because its main story quests are intensely boring and repetitive. And not because its planets are all mostly dull, lifeless husks. It's mainly because wherever I go in the universe, I'm haunted by the fleshy spectre of a misshapen man. I'm not even talking about the adoring fan (though he does also stalk my every step, too). Rather, I'm alluding to my own in-game father, who's randomly generated face and features are so utterly horrifying to me that I do a little sick in my mouth every time I run into him. Who can blame me, honestly, when his mouth is so high it clips right through his goddamn nose?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As you've hopefully read elsewhere on here, there's been an overnight windfall of insider info about Microsoft's long-term gaming biz objectives, thanks to documents accidentally released by the US Federal Trading Commission during its court case against Microsoft's Activision-Blizzard acquisition. We've learned that Microsoft are still rather keen on buying Nintendo (and Valve), and that the company had planned out the release of Dishonored 3, an Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion remaster and a Ghostwire: Tokyo sequel during the run-up to its acquisition of ZeniMax. 


The leaked documents also include extensive internal pitch and presentation materials regarding Microsoft's first-party gaming operations all the way to 2030. We can apparently expect a mid-generation Xbox console refresh, code-named Brooklin, in 2024; more intriguing, from a PC gaming perspective, is the promise of a 2028-bound "hybrid" Xbox platform, which will centre on a "thin client" OS that runs cloud-based games on “< $99”, "consumer or handheld" devices. Oh no, it's the power of the cloud all over again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft and Xbox representatives appeared in court earlier this year to get its $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard legally greenlit. Per usual court proceedings, various emails, documents, and more were sealed away from the public and press, but many unseen documents leaked this morning. It's how we learned Xbox head Phil Spencer considered acquiring Nintendo and Warner Bros. Games at one point, and that Microsoft is planning an Xbox Series X/S refresh with a new controller for next year. Other documents point to potential remasters of Fallout 3 and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, alongside other games. 
More specifically, a "ZeniMax Management Forecast" document details plans for various games, including the aforementioned remasters of Fallout 3 and Oblivion, alongside a potential sequel to 2022’s Ghostwire: Tokyo and a third installment in Arkane's Dishonored series.
You can take a look at the document for yourself below (credit to Game Pass Tracker on Twitter):

September 19, 2023
As you can see, this document mentions other games we know about, like Machine Games' Indiana Jones project, 2021's Deathloop, and the recently released Starfield. 
It also mentions The Elder Scrolls VI, which we just learned will launch no earlier than 2026 and will not launch on Sony's PlayStation 5. 
It's important to note that this leaked document is over three years old, so it's safe to assume plans have changed and that this schedule likely does not represent the company's current plans.
For more, read about how Xbox head Phil Spencer considered acquiring Nintendo and Warner Bros. Games in 2020, and then check out the refreshed Xbox Series X/S and new Xbox controller coming next year, according to internal Microsoft documents.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am in control of the RPS Game Club this month, so therefore I can do whatever I want - and this time I'm delving into the world of Hypnospace Outlaw's music. No other game sounds like Hypnospace. Featuring a veritable mountain of tracks (most of which was composed by the game's creator, Jay Tholen), Hypnospace’s extensive catalogue stretches across genres both real and imaginary. While Seepage’s Nothing Left For Me is a clear pastiche of Linkin Park, Fre3zer’s Icy Girl is a purposefully poor attempt to mimic Coolpunk, a genre built upon remixes of a jingle for a discontinued soda brand. The most exciting thing about Hypnospace is that its soundtrack is so dense and complex that there's opportunity to hyperfocus on one particular area to an intense - even problematic - degree.
Enter The Chowder Man, a stetson wearing Kid Rock analogue who makes frequent appearances throughout Hypnospace. A prominent rock musician in the 80s, Erik Helman (portrayed beautifully by musician, comedian and inventor of the Rick Roll Hot Dad) is attempting a last-ditch revival after his music career flatlined, transforming him from Jagger-esque superstar to sold-out jingle writer. The Chowder Man’s in-game discography is strange and varied, spanning from glorious rock ballads to 22 second earworms about a microwavable butter-based dessert. Totalling ten tracks, I have decided that it is my duty - nay, my fate - to rank and review them in their entirety. So let us commence this spiritual journey together, my friends, into the complex mind of The Chowder Man.

A sizeable helping of the same, if a 2020-dated release schedule leaked as part of today's accidental FTC Microsoft court document blowout is to be believed. The document is from a July 2020 Microsoft presentation about the acquisition of ZeniMax, during the early months of the Covid pandemic - as such, it doesn't reflect Microsoft and ZeniMax's plans today, following global lockdowns and the buyout, and several of the dates are obviously bogus. Still, it's probably a good steer as to current and future Bethesda and ZeniMax projects, which may include Dishonored 3 and remasters of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion and Fallout 3.

The email was sent 6th August 2020 to Microsoft's current chief marketing officer Chris Capossela and commercial chief marketing officer Takeshi Numoto. It begins with Spencer speculating that Nintendo may be receptive to approaches, thanks to one of Microsoft's allies, San Fran investment fund ValueAct, buying up Nintendo stock and so, attempting to steer the company's board towards accepting an acquisition.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marvel’s Avengers, Crystal Dynamics’ live service take on the comic-book superhero squad, is being pulled from sale at the end of the month. With just under two weeks left before it’s delisted, the game’s devs have knocked its price down to less than the price of a coffee.

It’s a hope that fans of Respawn’s beloved shooter have been holding onto for the best part of a decade now, but recent evidence in the form of quiet updates to Titanfall 2 and a cryptic teaser for its spiritual successor Apex Legends has given them renewed hope that something new might be on the way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With its steadfast love of imploding skulls and disintegrating ribcages, Mortal Kombat has always been the most adolescent of fighting games. Mortal Kombat 1 might be using its conspicuous numeric digit to suggest a reset or rethink of some kind, but in truth it isn't remotely concerned with reinventing its world of misfits. While part of me wishes this surface-level overhaul had been more radical, it's maybe unwise to expect that. For decades this series has embraced its love of brainless ultraviolence and childish storytelling. If Mortal Kombat 1 can be praised for anything, it is unwavering kommitment to the bit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Often when we talk about "hype" surrounding a release, it’s in anticipation of shared cultural euphoria more than that of a great gaming experience. Either way, a great RPG game hits different. Recently, Elden Ring and Baldur's Gate 3 have both been landmarks. Not to mention the enduring sweep of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and the Minesweeper-esque ubiquity of Skyrim. When studios get the RPG right, the end result inspires excitement and devotion in ways that feel utterly unique to the genre.
To this end I chatted to Dragon Age, Baldur’s Gate, and Mass Effect maestro Mark Darrah, some of the folks at Studio ZA/UM, and the minds behind the two definitive tomes on CRPG history: Matt Barton of Dungeons And Desktops, and Felipe Pepe of The CRPG Book. I wanted to ask these genere experts about all things choice and consequence, player freedom, and Baldur’s Gate 3’s phenomenal success. What turns a niche into a phenomenon? What goes into creating a great RPG? And what makes the genre so special to people? Turns out that last one is a big question to ask.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I continue to have astrophysics on the brain, and over the weekend, managed to spend an hour in Void Crew from Hutlihut Games and Focus Home. It's part of the surprisingly prosperous genre of "team up to complete some big unwieldy task with multiple moving parts" games, and while it hasn't yet hit the highs of Overcooked or reached the terrible depths of Barotrauma, I think the recently launched Early Access build might be worth your time. Amongst other things, it's trying for a curious blend of jolly party game and macabre theocracy work simulator. And it does have some rather swanky-looking ships.

The conviction is the result of a broader crackdown on local torrent trackers, where both operators and users have been brought to justice. In addition to the sentence, the man also agreed to pay nearly $1,500 in damages to anti-piracy group Rights Alliance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the weekend, Starfield players began to share reports of a strange paranormal infestation. There are asteroids in the game that, for reasons known only to gods and/or programmers, follow you from orbit to orbit, flying eerily in formation with your ship, and sometimes even accompanying you to a planet's surface. "In one of my weirdest Bethesda glitch experiences, I've got a tiny asteroid that's been following me for the past 30 hours," user ReverendRoo posted on Reddit, triggering an avalanche of comments reminiscent of UFO chasers spotting each other at a NASA open day. "I would catch a glimpse of it from time to time," wrote fattfett. "I tried to approach it but you can't. It stays away. I assumed it had a deeper meaning [toward] the endgame." Some players, like Blackdius, have multiple asteroids in tow. It seems impossible to blow them up. I've dug up a Youtube video below of one such clingy space boulder from a couple of weeks back. As you can see, it's not just a fixed background point like a screen artefact, but seems to move in response to the player's ship. Most peculiar.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is a fantastic game, largely due to the fact that it does such a good job of mimicking the Star Wars cinematic style. Whether it's the rush of stars streaking past a ship going into hyperspace or the distinct hum of a lightsaber, Respawn really went all out to match the aesthetic of one of the world's biggest movie franchises. One of the most important elements in achieving that is through music, and while the Star Wars sound is iconic and well-known, a good video game score has to be more than just an imitation of what came before. The music for Jedi: Survivor was written by Stephen Barton and Gordy Haab, and when I ask them what makes a good video game soundtrack, they answer in unison.

With two fantastic Spider-Man games under Insomniac’s belt, Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 feels like the culmination of the 2018 game and 2020’s Miles Morales in all the best ways. At a recent preview event, I spent roughly 90 minutes swinging and gliding across its new and improved New York City, taking down scores of bad guys and even challenging the Lizard. When my session concluded, I walked away thinking one thing: The first two games swung so that this third act could soar. 
This preview contains spoilers for Spider-Man (2018) and Spider-Man: Miles Morales.

The software can be used for perfectly legitimate purposes, but some also treat it as a piracy gateway. Yesterday, Plex informed users that it will no longer allow users to run servers at a hosting provider where lots of TOS violations occur. While copyright infringement isn't specifically mentioned, the action appears anti-piracy focused.

More specifically, the year 861 is when protagonist Basim Ibn Is'haq's journey begins in this city, the technological and cultural epicenter of the region at the time. After playing more than two hours of Assassin's Creed Mirage in developer Ubisoft Bordeaux's France-based office, I was impressed with its take on Baghdad. 
I love the open-world RPGs of the series' recent years, especially Assassin's Creed Origins and Odyssey, but I’d be lying if I said I was a fan of their respective cities. It's not that I didn't enjoy them, but they weren't memorable in the same way Assassin's Creed II’s Florence or Assassin's Creed Unity's Paris was. And that's because these cities were inserted into gigantic map…]]></summary>

Alongside news of Rebirth's release date, Square Enix and PlayStation also released a new and expansive trailer during today's State of Play. In it, we get our first looks at characters like Cait Sith, Vincent Valentine, and more. We also get to see The Gold Saucer, some fun minigames inspired by the visual style of Final Fantasy VII on PS1, and more of the game's open area exploration, which features ridable chocobos, vehicles, and segways.

We also got a glimpse of a player’s ability to ride and interact with a variety of Pandora’s alien creatures – clearly a highlight of the gameplay.

Peter Parker's old high-school is a location you can visit, as well as Miles Morales' Visions Academy
You will be able to swap between Parker Spider-Man and Morales Spider-Man almost instantly
New U.I. options and more visually interesting tasks to do around the city will, hopefully, prevent you from using the menus too much
Parker and Morales can user a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man app
Folks will make requests for Spider-Man's help. Sometimes they want a specific Spider-Man, often they don't care
There is a new fast-travel system
There are over 65 suits to unlock and wear

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, during Sony's recent State of Play livestream, we got a look at both the upcoming PSVR2 update and story DLC for the Resident Evil 4 Remake. 
The VR trailer is brief but does show the game in action. Much like the other VR port of RE4, the move brings the whole game into virtual reality. The big news is that the update is coming this winter.


More immediately, we finally got confirmation that "Separate Ways" is coming to RE4. For the uninitiated, Separate Ways was a side campaign starring, you guessed it, Ada Wong, initially released with the PlayStation 2 and all subsequent versions of the original Resident Evil 4. Separate Ways will be released next week, on September 21.
Moreover, Both Ada Wong and Albert Wesker will be made available as playable characters in the Mercenaries game mode.
For more Resident Evil 4 Remake, check out our review.
Correction: An earlier version of this story mistakenly identified "Separate Ways" as "Assignment Ada." We regret the error.]]></summary>

Since Lars Sundström, aka lman, joined our team as the iOS porter, we have made significant progress. Thus, you no longer need to compile ScummVM yourself in order to add it to your iOS or iPadOS device. 
If you want to help by testing this version, just follow this Testflight link and enroll yourself in the test program. This may require installing Apple’s Testflight app. You can find instructions on how to install games and how to play them on our documentation portal.
We truly appreciate your feedback. You can share your thoughts with the Testflight feedback feature, where you can attach screenshots and post detailed descriptions. Alternatively, you can use our bugtracker, e-mail us at ios@scummvm.org, or post on our Discord Server. Your help will let us eventually add ScummVM to the App Store.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following our announcement about affiliation with ZOOM-Platform, we would like to give a note that they have just started to offer the Macintosh versions of  Syberia 1 and Syberia 2 bundled with ScummVM.
This is important because ScummVM currently supports only the Macintosh versions of these games. These versions were produced by Tetraedge and are built on a completely different engine than the original Windows versions; basically, they are reimplementations, not ports. Now, thanks to the folks from ZOOM-Platform, you can easily obtain these game variants.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are pleased to announce an affiliate partnership with ZOOM-Platform, a supplier of DRM-free games. If you use a link from this website (or from our Wiki), the ScummVM project will receive a small amount of money to be used for web hosting and other expenses.
Any purchases from ZOOM-Platform qualify, but we especially encourage you to check out games supported by ScummVM, such as the Syberia 1, 2, Galador,  Obsidian as well as 18 titles from the Living Books series. In total, we counted 25 games supported by ScummVM, and this list is growing.
We will keep an up-to-date list of the games available from this platform on our Wiki and have added an affiliate link on the sidebar here.
