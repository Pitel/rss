Kayaking is awesome — it's such a rewarding way to spend time outdoors and see a part of nature that many of us don't get to on a regular basis. That said, loading up a kayak with all your gear, driving to a good (not-too-busy) destination, hauling it out, and knowing you have to do it all again once you're done? It can be too much of a hassle sometimes.
While a simulation game isn't going to replicate the real thing, a newly-released PC VR game called Kayak VR: Mirage captures the scenic beauty and chill vibes of kayaking.

We're looking to the skies once again, retro gaming fans, as Hamster has released another sky-blasting shmup to its ever-expanding Arcade Archives range. It's Namco sequel Dragon Saber, now available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.
Released into arcades in 1990, Dragon Saber is the follow-up to 1987's fantasy-themed blaster Dragon Spirit, and once again sees dragon-riding heroes take to the skies to battle armies of strange, invading creatures. As Huey and Siria, one or two players can jump into all-new simultaneous co-op action, which should give you a bit of balance against the hundreds of enemies and end-of-level guardians. In addition, Dragon Saber features a selection of new power-ups, along with a continuation of the game's lore, which was something of a novelty in the shmup genre at the time.
Unlike its predecessor, Dragon Saber did not receive a wide range of ports, only coming home in the form of a lone PC Engine edition. Aside from appearances on Namco's previous compilations, this Arcade Archives release represents the first global release of the sequel in some years. Dragon Saber is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.
You can check out the button-punching action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber World of Longplays.

If you're into anime, then chances are you can remember the first movie or TV show that got you hooked on the medium; your "gateway drug", if you will. For some, it might be TV shows like DragonBall Z or One Piece, others perhaps a specific movie like Ghost in the Shell or Akira (indeed, I had to really go back through the memory archives to determine whether Akira was the first one for me; it was definitely incredibly early in my life). For me, however, the very earliest memory I have of watching anime was the incredible video game adaptation, Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie, released in 1994.
I'll admit, I wasn't super into the Street Fighter series when I was young. In fact, it probably wasn't until Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike that I really started to take notice. I did, however, dabble in Street Fighter II': Special Champion Edition on the Mega Drive. I was terrible at it, naturally, since I was still in single figures at the time, but I really enjoyed playing as Ryu or Ken and just spamming the 'Hadoken' move non-stop (which still wasn't quite enough to win most of the time, granted).

Gummy Cat is delaying part of its launch for Bear and Breakfast. The upcoming B&B sim needs some extra tuning, so while PC players will still get it on schedule, Switch and controller support for Bear and Breakfast has been pushed back.
In a message from the dev team, the studio says that playing with a controller has not felt as good as they wanted. Thus, those versions of the game need a little more time in the oven.
"We are working very hard to finish the extra work, with our goal being to release the game on the Switch as soon as possible, sometime within the next couple of months at most," reads the statement.
The PC version, meanwhile, is still on track for a Steam launch on July 28. However, controller support will not be available for PC players at launch. That will come at a later date, "within the same time frame."

Building a bed and breakfast
While no date's been set, at least PC players can still get hands-on with the game this month. At least, so long as you're okay with mouse and keyboard, rather than a controller.
Bear and Breakfast is a charming-looking life sim game about a bear, running its own bed and breakfast. Having popped up at a few showcases over the last year or so, it seems to be all about attracting customers and gradually renovating your establishment.

It's a fun take on a management sim-style game, and I really love the look of it. For a little extra time to make sure the controller support works alright, waiting's no issue.
PC players will get to open their establishments early on July 28, while Switch and controller users will be waiting just a while longer for Bear and Breakfast.

YOU GUYS. Hollow Knight is really good. Why did no one tell me? I mean, apart from everyone who's ever played it, who I steadfastly ignored because it didn't look like my kind of game, and because Ori and the Blind Forest — a rather similar platforming metroidvania game — was too hard for my poor little hands?
Well, the mistake has been rectified, at least. I've finally played Hollow Knight. In fact, I've apparently played it for 28.5 hours, which is a lot of bug-time. And there's so much to talk about from that entire day's worth of playing! The melancholy, the audio work, the music, the cuteness... but instead, as you can tell from the title, I want to talk about how Hollow Knight contributes to a legacy that has existed since the very first days of gaming: The need to take notes.

Advanced Dungeons & Dragons: Iron & Blood: Warriors of Ravenloft came to me as a request from the fabulous Akeashar. I had never heard of it, but my local game shop had a copy in stock. As I browsed the rack of PS1 games, I couldn’t remember the name. I just knew it was ridiculous, and sure enough, I found it based on that fact alone.
I don’t know. Initially, I thought it might not be that bad. There’s a cheesy ‘90s CGI cutscene that seems to go on forever and doesn’t make much sense unless you read the story in the instruction manual, but the presentation seems like whoever made the UI maybe sort of cared. One of the characters is a werewolf, so that’s always a plus for me.

The loop is “solve puzzles, unlock more puzzles”, with the added pay-off of the explorable world growing as you do so.

Elsewhere, the Sega Genesis Mini 2 was confirmed for North America, and Nintendo announced that it has acquired the visual production company 'Dynamo Pictures', with a view to enhance its video output for Nintendo IP.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Puzzles and horror, together again
Happy Friday! Last week we started MADiSON, a new first-person horror puzzle game. It definitely reminded me a lot of Visage, which is one of the spooky games I admire, so I’ve been having a good time. It took me a few hours to learn that you can’t die in MADiSON (so far?) so I played a little too scared, but this time I’m ready to charge around the place.

I think this will be most of the stream, but if we somehow finish it mega early, I’m nearly done with some Dark Souls II DLC and we could chip away at that.
See you tonight for some tasteful jumpscares!
Drop by Destructoid’s Twitch channel every Friday at 9:00 p.m. Eastern to hang out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[600 Platinum Points via My Nintendo
A My Nintendo Fire Emblem Warriors reward is coming soon, but don't get too excited! For 600 platinum you'll net a memo pad.
Announced by way of My Nintendo news, the reward will contain "full color images" of both versions of new protagonist Shez, as well as several key characters in the narrative (including members of the titular "three" houses). Typically it takes roughly 1-2 weeks for these rewards to go primetime.
Here's the full description from Nintendo:
"Jot down battle strategies, take notes, or simply doodle 'til you drop with this full-color memo pad themed after the new Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes game for the Nintendo Switch system. Its pages feature stunning character art of new protagonist Shez (both male and female variants), Arval, Edelgard, Dimitri, and Claude."

Currently the listing is not live. In fact, if you click on it, it'll bring you to this random printable Triangle Strategy box art cover page. But having followed rewards like this closely for some time, I wouldn't expect it to sell out instantly. In fact, several recent rewards like the Mario Strikers bag and the Switch Sports cooling towel are still up for grabs. Stranger things have happened in terms of items running out of stock, but this one should be fine within a 24-hour window of going live; at least.
[Update: And the Fire Emblem Warriors reward is live! It's 600 Platinum.]

It's been a good long time since we've had a reason to bring up Dark Souls: Design Works — and it's amusing to go back and read Chris' thoughts about the art book from 2014. If you're in the mood to look at some badass dark-fantasy imagery, it's never too late. Udon Entertainment has issued reprints of the Design Works books for the whole trilogy.
The main difference with these reprints is that they sport new cover art. I'm sure some readers will prefer the original tome-like cover design, which is classy, but I'll admit that I'm a sucker for the crazed Gwyn concept art — that fiery backdrop really pops.
These hardcover books focus on concept art, key visuals, and character and monster designs, but there are …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's also a demo and sale for the first game
Fuga: Melodies of Steel is getting a follow-up. Developer CyberConnect2 confirms that it plans to release Fuga: Melodies of Steel 2.
Melodies of Steel 2 will be a direct sequel to the first game. Not much else is known at the moment, but more news is planned for July 28. A "Fuga: Melodies on the Battlefield" anniversary stream is planned for that date.
https://twitter.com/Fuga_CC2_en/status/1547783715476357121
Additionally, the first game Fuga: Melodies of Steel is on sale for 30% off on the eShop until July 24. A demo is also available, with everything up to Chapter 3 playable and saves transferrable to the full game.
Rev up that Soul Cannon
If you're unfamiliar with the first game, Fuga: Melodies of Steel is an RPG about a bunch of young animal children and their giant tank. No, seriously. It follows a band of misfits who commandeer an all-powerful tank to fight back against an evil empire.
It's got a timeline-based battle system where you need to swap around different party members on each of the gun emplacements. Certain weapons tackle enemy types like fliers or smaller ground tanks better, and characters can learn new abilities over time.
And of course, if all else fails, there is the Soul Cannon. Basically a giant win card that will offer automatic victory in key fights, at the cost of a party member's soul. It's uh, bleak, to say the least.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFGO3bHkNB4
Still, it wound up being a surprisingly fun time that I was glad I tried out last year. It's got some really cool ideas with its party management, battle systems, and Metal Slug-style tank designs. The demo's worth giving a shot if any of that appeals to you, and I'm pretty intrigued in seeing what's in store for the 28th.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whether it's because of its gorgeous visuals, deeply disturbing sci-fi monstrosities, or the return of Glen Schofield, The Callisto Protocol has become one of the most anticipated games of 2022. But where did this new twisted tale come from? Join us as we sit down with the horror master himself to discuss the origins of developer Striking Distance Studios' first game and show off some brand new gameplay as well!


Marcus Stewart and Alex Stadnik are here to grill Glen on the title's origins. A few years after his departure from Activision, the CEO, and founder of Striking Distance Studios found himself in the desert, painting and trying to figure out what the next step in his career would be. That led him to Callisto and his brand new studio. But how long did it take him to form the story structure? Did he always know how the game would end? You'll just have to watch the video to find out.
On top of the Callisto origin story, we're also showing off some brand new gameplay. Protagonist Jacob Lee traverses the harrowing hallways of Jupiter's dead moon, fending off the terrifying Biophage at every step. We also get a fresh look at the satisfying and devastating shotgun and how it tears through those who would do you harm.
If you want to learn more about The Callisto Protocol ahead of its December 2 release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, be sure to head over to our exclusive cover hub below, where you'll find our preview impressions, the GI cover reveal, and more looks at the game. If that's not enough, you can head over to our Rapid-Fire interview with Glen where he quickly details more about the game, his horror influences, and comments on a particular fan theory. Thanks, as always, for watching.]]></summary>

Visual-heavy trailer, right? You'll play a detective, Carl Faubert, and yes, there's a dog sled. You'll also travel by boat in search of clues — and survivors — in a remote mining village plagued by an unnatural mist. Parabole is going for the "omniscient narrator" angle again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Destiny is now officially part of the PlayStation family
Sony Interactive Entertainment's agreement to acquire Bungie has officially closed. With the ink dried, Bungie is now officially part of the PlayStation lineup.
Sony confirmed the news today, welcoming Bungie into the PlayStation family of studios. Bungie also shared the news, saying the studio is excited for the future.
https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1547989404269965314
The deal was announced in January, near the start of the year. The $3.6 billion deal brings Destiny into the PlayStation lineup. However, Destiny will continue to publish on multiple platforms. SIE president Jim Ryan said at the time that the deal is part of Sony's strategy to expand the reach of PlayStation to a wider audience.
"We understand how vital Bungie’s community is to the studio and look forward to supporting them as they remain independent and continue to grow," Ryan told GI Biz. "Like Bungie, our community is core to PlayStation’s DNA, and our shared passion for the gamer and building the best place to play will now evolve even further."
Deals still in the works
While the Sony and Bungie agreement is now closed, others are still waiting for approval. Microsoft announced its intent to purchase Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion in January as well. The Microsoft-ActiBlizz deal is under scrutiny from several regulators though.
Take-Two Interactive also announced its plan to acquire Zynga for $12.7 billion in January, and the deal closed in May.
Still, the acquisitions machine rolls on, as plenty more have been announced since January. Those like the purchase of Crystal Dynamics, Eidos Montreal, and Square Enix Montreal by Embracer Group have still been popping up this year. Whether we see more from Sony or not, we'll have to wait and see.

As the lengthy title suggests, Warriors Orochi 3 Ultimate Definitive Edition features every last drop of content from all previous editions of Warriors Orochi 3, dating right back to the Xbox 360 and PS3 releases.

The live-action adaptations of the Resident Evil franchise have had a real rough time of it, huh? Paul W.S. Anderson’s six-movie take on the series — while commercially successful — was widely slated by fans of the games and critics alike for diverting too far away from the tone and scope of Capcom’s source (plus, some of them were just straight up bad), and the 2021 reboot, Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City, didn’t fare much better. Despite being significantly more faithful to the games, Johannes Roberts’ movie was criticised for its writing and attempts to cram as much fan-service into one movie as possible.
When Netflix announced its own take on Resident Evil via an eight-episode series, fans were understandably sceptical that the streaming juggernaut could pull off what Anderson and Roberts failed to do. Not only that, but initial details on the series set off alarm bells immediately: a series focusing on the daughters of Albert Wesker? What? It didn’t sound promising, particularly when show-runners would later promise that the series would tie in with the game series' canon.

Sega has released the names of 10 more titles to be included on its upcoming retro hardware Sega Mega Drive II Mini. The 10 games are, as of this writing only confirmed for the JPN model of the dinky doohickey, which is reflected in the way that some of these titles were not released outside of Japan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e847P6Ynalk
Among the new titles listed are Capcom classics Super Street Fighter II and Final Fight CD, as well as legendary RPGs Lunar: The Silver Star and Lunar: Eternal Blue. Also in the mix is SNK's Fatal Fury 2, Treasure's Alien Soldier, and the bizarre tricycle-based arcade game Spatter. A particularly quirky addition is the Wondermega Collection, essentially a sampler disc that includes several Sega Game Toshokan service titles and four CD+G karaoke tracks. A neat little piece of Sega CD history.
The full list of revealed titles is as follows.
Sega Mega Drive Games:
Aah! Harimanada
Alien Soldier
Fatal Fury 2
Gyuwanburaa Jikochuushin Ha Katayama Masayuki no Majong Dojo
Spatter
Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers
Tatsujin
Sega Mega CD Titles
Final Fight CD
Lunar: Eternal Blue
Lunar: The Silver Star
Wondermega Collection
As you might have read on this here website, it has been confirmed that the hardware will receive a western release in the form of the Sega Genesis 2, which will be hitting the shelves day and date alongside the Japanese edition this fall. We can very likely expect any of the above titles that received an English localization back in the day, (Final Fight and Lunar: The Silver Star for example), to be featured on the western release, although official confirmation from Sega is still forthcoming.
The Sega Mega Drive II / Genesis 2 Mini launches October 27.

A lengthy update video divulged a number of details, including an idea of how monetization will look and why developer Full Circle chose to go the FTP route. 
Full Circle creative director Cuz Parry explains the decision to go FTP stems from the team’s desire for players across all platforms and budgets to easily access its upcoming skateboarding simulator. It also wants to keep the community together, citing how DLC in previous Skate titles splintered the player base. To that end, Skate will support cross-play and cross-progression across consoles, PC, and mobile.

It's been one year since the launch of Pokemon Unite, and the team is celebrating. Over the next few weeks, Pokemon Unite is getting new playable Pokemon, cosmetics, and more to celebrate its first anniversary.
The celebration starts next week, with the release of Glaceon, the icy Eevee evolution. Glaceon joins on July 21 alongside a challenge, which will let players earn a free Glaceon Unite License.
Two more are expected to join the fray, too. The gigantic Buzzwole enters the arena on August 3. And on August 15, Tyranitar lumbers into battle.

Alongside the new playable Pokemon, a new mode is also debuting. Boss Rush will have players team up to take on powerful bosses and earn rewards. Those who finish with higher scores will earn more. The Boss Rush will be available for three periods of time.
Pokemon Unite Boss Rush windows
July 21 at 12:00 a.m. PT to July 24 at 4:59 p.m. PT
July 31 at 5 p.m. PT to August  7 at 4:59 p.m. PT
August 14 at 5 p.m. PT to August 21 at 4:59 p.m. PT
New duds for the new year
A new Battle Pass season will also start rolling out on July 21. Season 9 will have new rewards and levels to pursue, all for the goal of having the coolest-looking Pokemon on the Pokemon Unite field.
There will also be a festive log-in bonus for the first anniversary of Pokemon Unite. Logging in for five days between July 21 and October 12 will net you rewards for each day:
Day 1: Pikachu and Fashionable Style: Pikachu
Day 2: Lucario and Concert Style: Lucario
Day 3: Blastoise and Firefighter Style: Blastoise
Day 4: Snorlax and Bedtime Style: Snorlax
Day 5: Sylveon and Checkered Style: Sylveon
With those, plus a festive anniversary reward chain to chase too, seems like a lot of freebies are up for grabs in Pokemon Unite. The first anniversary might be a good time to log back in if you've lapsed over the last year.

With the reveal of a new trailer for Bayonetta 3 along with a launch date announcement, Nintendo fans are looking back over the last couple of weeks with a question on their mind: Why didn't the company bundle up this news with the third-party announcements from the Nintendo Direct Mini: Partner Showcase and deliver a full-fat Nintendo Direct?
In the time since the Partner Showcase — which, let's not forget, featured some pretty impressive reveals and shadow-drops itself — we've had a Xenoblade Direct, the reveal of an entirely new Kirby game coming this summer, and the Bayonetta 3 news. We've also had reveals of a new Splatoon-themed Switch OLED, Joy-Con, and Pro Controller, and another a micro-announcement in the form of Pokémon Puzzle League coming to the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack. The latter perhaps isn't Direct-worthy on its own, unless you're the lovely Jon Cartwright (formerly of this parish), in which case it's worthy of the 'one last thing' slot.

A renowned modder has canceled their ongoing project to mod Sega's latest release, Sonic Origins, stating that the state of the title's game code is making their plans for the mod project unfeasible.

Odds are if you're talking to someone who loves storytelling in video games, there's lore from at least one game that they can recite by heart. Especially when it comes to games that really focus on the gameplay first, like League of Legends or Bloodborne, lore is a great, indirect way to get players engaged in the story of your world if there isn't much time in the game itself to tell that story.
It can be a case of "come for the game, stay for the story," or sometimes players get into a game because they learned about all the lore first, but either way, loving a game for the world it creates for us is a beautiful thing. But I have to be honest. For someone who loves story in games like, a lot, I just can't bring myself to get into…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lost classic prepares for its prodigal return
In just a week's time, a little bit of lost gaming history will be restored, as Square Enix prepares to release its HD remake of the classic '90s RPG Live A Live. The publisher has released one final trailer to stoke the hype fires ahead of the adventure's July 22 launch date.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_F_izc7nlnU
Directed by Square Enix veteran Takashi Takita, and released to the Super Famicom platform in 1994, Live A Live was an incredibly ambitious title that attempted to tell the intertwining tales of eight distinct characters, with each tale featuring its own bespoke mechanics, tone, and maps — married together by a grid-based battle system and an umbrella arc involving the very fate of time itself. Despite its ahead-of-its-time and hugely lofty concepts, Live A Live was something of a flop on release, and would thus not receive any official localization outside of Japan.
Square Enix's new edition of Live A Live is being developed by studio Historia, which has meticulously recreated the original Super Famicom adventure with new "2D HD" visuals. In addition, the original 16-bit score — beautifully composed by industry veteran Yoko Shimomura — has been rearranged and rerecorded for the new release. The Live A Live remake will offer RPG fans worldwide their first official opportunity to check out this lost piece of experimental game design. Born out of time and flying under the radar, perhaps this new release will afford this forgotten release the opportunity to earn the legacy that has evaded it for three decades.
Live A Live launches on Nintendo Switch July 22. You can download a demo from the eShop today.

Then I learned that although grime can’t move, it makes up for it with cunning. It cements itself on surfaces in ways you wouldn't expect, as if to belittle my cleaning standards. After many encounters, I've identified this menace as The Underside: a secret boss you'll need to beat to become the ultimate power washer.

Since June, it feels like we've been getting a proper avalanche of Sonic Frontiers news, with the game currently scheduled to release toward the end of 2022. Although initial fan reaction to the gameplay footage was, shall we say, mixed, it seems many people are starting to come around to the game's drastic new direction, particularly after its impressive showing at the recent Nintendo Direct Mini: Partner Showcase.
In a piece by Game Informer, it's been revealed that Sonic Team is hoping the latest entry will elevate the series' overarching narrative to new heights and transcend the usual "good guys versus bad guys" scenario that's been the focal point of the franchise up till now.

For those who have dabbled with Puzzle League, this is obvious information, but please bear with us. Tetris Attack, the SNES game, was a westernized version of the Japanese game Panel de Pon, which starred its own cute cartoon characters. Tetris Attack removed all of these and replaced them with characters and enemies from Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island (and was relocalized for Japan as BS Yoshi's Panepon). However, released in North America in 2000, Pokémon Puzzle League was the first game under the 'Puzzle League' banner, with characters from the Pokémon anime spicing up its addictive block puzzling.

There are so many interesting nuggets tucked into the game's world, it can be difficult for even the most passionate fans to see and appreciate all of it.
The good news, then, is that there is a stunning book on the way that dives into all of it called 'Abyssal Archive'. Written by Dark Souls scholar 'Lokey' over the course of several years, the book comes in two volumes and boasts incredible detail throughout, with pre-orders set to ship in early 2023.

The PC port for The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time has been out for a few months now, and modders have been doing some pretty crazy stuff with it, too. Now, it looks like the port can also be played on Mac OS and hacked Wii U consoles, opening it up to a much wider audience.
As reported by VGC, the latest release of the port from Harbour Masters can be downloaded via the team’s official Discord. Dubbed 'Ship of Harkinian', the latest release also comes with a few extra bits and bobs, including:

The search engine voluntarily complies with court orders targeted at third-party Internet providers. This is also true in the UK, where The Pirate Bay initially remained unblocked. A recent wave of removal requests corrected this initial oversight and hundreds of Pirate Bay domains have since been removed.

Recycling has been a pretty big thing for a while now, and for good reason. Chucking a load of plastic away is, of course, terrible for the environment, so why not break it down and use it for something else? One talented artist has done just that, taking a whole bunch of random bits of garbage and remaking it into something truly beautiful - a miniature diorama of Super Mario Odyssey.
Posted by Studson Studio on YouTube, the progress video shows how he went about creating the miniature diorama, from combining bits of plastic junk to form the foundation of the Odyssey ship to creating a base of dirt from, er... dirt. It's a fascinating process and we recommend you watch the whole video to truly appreciate the work that's gone into this thing. We appreciate all types of art, of course, but when it also goes toward helping the environment, heck yeah - we love it.

Epic Games Store users can bag themselves an absolute gem of a title for free, as Dotemu's Wonder Boy: The Dragon's Trap is offered up to all EGS customers gratis this week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYXzXBbFKOY
Developed by Lizardcube and released in 2017, Wonder Boy: The Dragon's Trap is a remake done right. Based upon the excellent 1989 Sega Master System RPG, Lizardcube's title recreates the cart-based classic in a 1:1 capacity, switching out the 8-bit visuals for stylish and attractive hand-drawn visuals. In addition, the remake features a charming, rerecorded score, and includes new features such as additional difficulty options and a new playable hero, Wonder Girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMah9liwPyY
In addition to the Wonder Boy remake, Epic Games Store will also be giving away  Baeloth's Gladiator of the Dark Pits expansion pack, for use with Dungeons & Dragons adventure title Idle Champions of the Forgotten Realm. Players need only log in to the D&D title from July 14 to automatically unlock access to the DLC expansion.
The new titles will be made available for all to download from July 14-21. Next week, from July 21-28, players can claim the shopkeeping sim Shop Titans and the 64-player WWI FPS Tannenberg.
If you do not have it already, be sure to pick up The Dragon's Trap. Without hyperbole, it is one of the most enjoyable, enduring, and compelling remakes ever made.

The trailer looks proof-of-concept-y, as is often the way, but I like the concept.
And looking over the screenshots — a tomato being slowly sliced, a filet sizzling on the stovetop, a splash of water hitting a glass of ice cubes— I can just "hear" these images.

Wordle has seen huge success, as it went from cute and engaging daily game to overnight craze. It's now owned by the New York Times, and the Times is partnering with Hasbro now to make a Wordle board game.
CNN reports that the New York Times and Hasbro are collaborating on Wordle: The Party Game, a board game adaptation of the online version.
In the board game version, players compete with each other to guess words the other players have scribbled. Rather than guessing the word solo against the computer, you're trying to guess the other team's chosen five-letter word. It's kind of like Mastermind or Battleship, but with words.

There are a few different game types out of the box, including a "fast mode" that involves a clock and team variations. I also dig the dry-erase boards and markers, so it's easy to just re-use the same board over and over again.
Wordle: The Party Game is currently live for pre-order on Amazon, the Hasbro site, and soon on Target. The board game goes for $19.99 and will ship on October 1, 2022.
Guess the secret phrase
While strange, it isn't all too surprising. Board games are increasingly popular as of late, and board game adaptations are no different. Look at how many video games have been turned into tabletop versions over the years.
With the popularity of Wordle, I imagine a Worlde board game will absolutely sell like hotcakes. And now I'm just curious if other popular online games are soon to be adapted, too. How much longer until newfound Heardle owner Spotify turns the audio game into a board game?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You can DDT the competition very soon
The multiplayer wrestling battle royale Rumbleverse is launching quite soon. Iron Galaxy announced today that Rumbleverse will launch on August 11 for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, and PC via Epic.
The free-to-play brawler goes live on the 11th, and a week later the first season of Rumbleverse will kick off. According to Iron Galaxy's blog, this will include a Battle Pass with cosmetics to earn along a special path.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suOmxeeyRsI
Rumbleverse is a 40-player battle royale-style game. But rather than guns and shooting, Rumbleverse is about good ol' fashioned wrestling. Characters can pick up and use various moves like strikes, kicks, uppercuts, and giant slams to knock out opponents.
Announced in December during The Game Awards 2021, Rumbleverse was set to launch in February. Iron Galaxy delayed the launch though, and has been running tests and early playtimes. Now, it seems like the fighter's ready to head into the ring.
Bah gawd
It's been hard to miss Rumbleverse, as it's been making the rounds in the fighting game community social sphere with each new playtest. And I'll admit, the concept has me intrigued. Plenty of battle royale games hone in on accuracy and shooting ability, but very few have sated the brawling, fighting, wrasslin' urge.
There have been several battle royales that have gone into and out of the spotlight over the years, but this one at least seems worth a test drive. At the low, low price of free, why not?
Rumbleverse slams onto PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and PC via the Epic Games Store on August 11.

Publisher Dotemu and developer Tribute Games have proudly announced that super-fun beat-'em-up Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge smashed its release sales expectations, having sold a mighty one million copies during its first seven days of release. Radical.
"Tribute Games set out to make the ultimate celebration of a chapter in TMNT history that means the world to us, and it’s been wonderful to watch the accessible fun of beat-em-ups resonate with longtime fans and genre newcomers alike," said Tribute Games Co-Founder Jean-Francois Major in a press release. "We’re thankful for all of the support and encouragement the passionate TMNT community has shown us since the reveal of TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge, and we look forward to watching players continue to discover the easter eggs we’ve hidden throughout the game while chaining together some bodacious combos."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozKsDzumb0c
Kicking off on PC and consoles on July 16, Shredder's Revenge is a passionate recall of the classic Konami TMNT arcades of yesterday. Leonardo, Donatello, Michaelangelo, and Raphael take to the streets of New York once again to see off the evil Foot Clan, as well as a host of iconic villains from the classic 1987 animated series. Joined on the journey by pals Splinter, April O'Neil, and an unlockable Casey Jones, our heroes in a half-shell battle it out in colorful and chaotic arcade action. It's good old-fashioned fun for one-to-four players, and a must-buy for any fan of the enduring TMNT franchise.
TMNT: Shredder's Revenge is available now on PS4, PC, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. It is also available via Xbox Game Pass. You can check out our review of the bodacious brawler right here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's going to be 'intense'
Another Aliens video game is in development, this time at Survios, the VR-centric studio behind games like Raw Data, Creed: Rise to Glory, and The Walking Dead Onslaught.
The studio hasn't announced the name yet, but says the game will fall into the single-player, action-horror camp, which is something I can vaguely latch onto. Vaguely. It's another "original storyline, set between the Alien and Aliens ﬁlms," in which a "battle-hardened veteran has a vendetta against the Xenomorphs." Alien Islolation 2 this is not.
Built in Unreal Engine 5 for PC, consoles, and VR platforms, the Aliens game "will take full advantage of Survios’ expertise in creating immersive and authentic gaming experiences."
More details at SDCC
With only some Xenomorph artwork to go on for now, we'll have to wait until San Diego Comic-Con to learn more. Survios will share more details during the Alien: Expanding a Dark and Frightening Universe panel at SDCC next Thursday, July 21 at 2:00 p.m. Pacific.
"The vast universe of Alien is full of untold stories, and opportunities to create gripping original games," said Luigi Priore, vice president, Disney, Pixar, and 20th Century Games. "We're thrilled to work with a team like Survios who shares our passion for Alien."
The studio is very much staffing up, hence this early, detail-light game announcement.
For all of the effort so far, I feel like the Aliens series hasn't been able to capture lightning in a bottle lately, and I'm not convinced that'll change anytime soon. Another upcoming game, Aliens: Dark Descent from Tindalos Interactive, is a squad-commanding real-time action game. Could be good! Or it could be another one that pads out the list.
At least with VR in the picture, we might get some adrenaline-pumping moments.

Flynn has been a prominent writer across both the long-running Archie Comics and IDW Publishing runs of the Sonic the Hedgehog series, with hundreds of credits to his name. However, joining Sonic Team for a mainline entry is new territory.
"Ian has been working as a comic writer for a long time, so I was very familiar with his work, but after reading the IDW comics, I was even more impressed with his talent," Sonic Team creative officer Takashi Iizuka says. "That's why I wanted to ask him to work on the story fo…]]></summary>

The game’s first open beta kicks off on July 26. Additionally, an early access period begins a week earlier on July 19 for anyone who participated in May’s closed alpha or received Twitch drop codes.
The open beta for the free-to-play fighter will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Online play supports cross-play and features rollback netcode. The beta will include eight maps, a variety of gameplay modes, and the same roster of characters playable during the alpha with one big addition: the Iron Giant.
The peace-loving robot from the (criminally underrated) titular animated film joins the fray, and a new trailer provides glimpses of him in action. 


We still don’t know when MultiVersus will launch in full, but we’ve been mostly impressed with it so far. These tests should only help the game become better when it goes prime time.]]></summary>

While I am surprised Linus Torvalds allows this or wonder if he even is aware of it given his past statements on Linux kernel updates not breaking user-space, the Intel GuC firmware handling being versioned and not supporting backwards compatibility can throw a wrench into your upgrade experience like with the upcoming Linux 5.19 kernel...]]></summary>

What do a murderous witch, a grandmother’s mysterious death, and demonic possession have in common? An old Polaroid-style camera. Discovering how means braving Madison, an indie horror title that fits within the post-P.T. first-person haunted house mold. Players explore an impressively rendered home solving puzzles and avoiding apparitions armed with a camera that’s more than meets the eye.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new game based on the film Aliens is in the works by developer Survios in partnership with 20th Century Games.
Survios primarily develops VR titles and is perhaps best known as the team behind Creed: Rise to Glory. The studio describes the untitled project as a single-player “immersive action horror game,” and it’s being made for PC, console, and VR. The game's website states that it's developed using Unreal Engine 5 and has an original story that takes place between Alien and Aliens "where a battle hardened veteran has a vendetta against the Xenomorphs."
There’s no trailer or screenshots, but Survios says we’ll learn more about the game on July 21 during San Diego Comic-Con at the “Alien: Expanding a Dark and Frightening Universe” panel.
This project is unrelated to Aliens: Dark Descent, the Aliens tactical shooter, announced during Summer Game Fest last month. Survios is hiring for positions on the title, suggesting it’s still very early in development. As such, it has no release window, but hopefully, we’ll get a better idea of what it entails during Comic-Con.]]></summary>

That's because we're talking about our favourite towers in games. This means we need to draw a distinction between towers (the gamified concept as most popularly complained about in Ubisoft games) and towers (the architectural thing). Luckily, games have a lot of both.
Meanwhile, Nate's fish issue (fisssue?) is growing worse, I am enjoying the local acts performing on the summer bandstand, and we talk about Lord Of The Rings and Lord Of The Rings related things. What fantasy creature would you like to conjure into real-life existence? We both said orc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony is rolling out its first-ever PlayStation-focused loyalty program called PlayStation Stars. In a blog post by Grace Chen, vice president of network advertising, loyalty & licensed merchandise, she explains that PlayStation Stars is a free program that rewards points by completing “campaigns” and challenges while playing games. 
According to Chen, earning points may require you to “win tournaments, earn specific trophies, or even be the first player to platinum a blockbuster title in your local time zone.” PlayStation Stars will also have a “monthly check-in” campaign that players fulfill simply by playing a game. 
You can redeem points on rewards that may include PSN wallet funds or select PS Store products. Users also subscribed to PlayStation Plus gain the added benefit of automatically earning loyalty points for making purchases.
Loyalty points can also be spent on “digital collectibles." Examples described in the post are digital figurines of game characters or old PlayStation devices. These collectibles will evidently come in various rarities, with Chen stating players will always have “ultra rare” collectibles to chase. 
These collectibles may sound like NFTs, but they’re not. As Chen adamantly explains in a Washington Post interview, these digital items can’t be traded or sold and PlayStation Stars does not utilize blockchain technology in any way.  
“It’s definitely not NFTs. Definitely not” says Chen.
PlayStation Stars will gradually roll out across different regions sometime later this year. What do you think of this new loyalty program? Let us know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a move that feels more overdue than surprising, Nintendo acquired animation studio Dynamo Pictures and renamed it Nintendo Pictures. The purchased studio will focus on developing visual content for Nintendo's various IPs. 
According to Eurogamer, it's unusual for Nintendo to acquire companies despite its recent SRD and Next-Level Games deals. Moreover, Nintendo Pictures' – Dynamo was a production company behind several animated Pikmin shorts – work will be separate from Illumination, the animation studio behind the upcoming Super Mario Bros. Movie. Official documentation of the purchase states: 
"Nintendo has decided to acquire 100% of the outstanding shares (excluding treasury shares) of Dynamo Pictures and make it a wholly owned subsidiary to strengthen the planning and production structure of visual content in the Nintendo group. The Acquisition is expected to close on October 3, 2022…[and] will have only a minor effect on Nintendo's results for this fiscal year."
What animated Nintendo projects are you looking forward to? Let us know in the comments below!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rumbleverse, Iron Galaxy’s pro-wrestling-tinged spin on battle royale, is finally going live next month. The game was set to arrive in February before being delayed and has been playable through various technical tests. 
First announced during The Game Awards 2021, Rumbleverse is a free-to-play battle royale where players duke it out by brawling instead of shooting. Wrestling moves like suplexes and clotheslines reign supreme, and weapons include steel chairs and other melee items. Players can even climb up structures to face off on rooftops and leap between buildings. Rumbleverse supports cross-play and cross-progression between consoles and PC. 


Rumbleverse launches on August 11 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC via The Epic Games Store. Season One begins on August 18]]></summary>

While certain games like Shadow the Hedgehog, Sonic the Hedgehog (2006), Sonic and the Black Knight, and Sonic Forces have experimented with new combat mechanics for the games' protagonists to use, Sonic Frontiers looks to evolve that gameplay component in unprecedented ways.
When Sonic Team set out to create Sonic Frontiers, it wanted to give players more freedom with which to operate. It did this by introducing a new open-zone concept, where players are able to run through and explore various biomes without a predefined path to guide their gameplay. That shift from largely linear stages…]]></summary>

The hack-and-slash zombie game, Lollipop Chainsaw, might have received lukewarm reviews, but a remake is still on the way. Dragami Games president Yoshimi Yasuda took to Twitter today to let avid fans know it'll "be as close as possible to a remaster." You can check out his post below.
ロリポップチェーンソーリメイクに対し沢山のファンよりご質問を頂戴しましたのでお答えします…!!!
#ロリポップチェーンソー#lollipopchainsaw #ドラガミゲームス#dragamigames pic.twitter.com/V6iQG8mVDx
July 12, 2022
In his statement, Yasuda spoke about the primary goal of the remake and the incoming changes:
The original Lollipop Chainsaw was released in 2012 and was about high school cheerleader Juliet and her journey to survival amid a zombie apocalypse in California. For those of you that never played the game, you're right to assume that Juliet donned a flesh-shredding chainsaw. Suda51 and James Gunn (The Suicide Squad and Guardians of the Galaxy) collaborated on the gory, blood-pumping adventure. Joe Juba reviewed Lollipop Chainsaw and concluded his review by saying:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year, we reported on the relaunch of PlayStation Plus, a fusion of the original Plus and PlayStation Now benefits. Three tiers from cheapest to most expensive – Essential, Extra, and Premium – each offered downloadable games, with the latter two options providing game catalogs in the hundreds. According to the official PlayStation Blog, "the inaugural Game Catalog lineup for the all-new PlayStation Plus" drops for Extra and Premium members this month. Some of the titles include Stray and Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade. 
Your PlayStation Plus Game Catalog lineup for July includes:

July 13, 2022
Stray is a third-person adventure starring a stray cat navigating a cybercity to get home. As a cat, you can interact with the environment in amusing ways while unearthing an ancient mystery. Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade, one of my favorite games on PlayStation 5, retells the classic steampunk JRPG with a new-gen sheen. You even get to play as world-class ninja Yuffie in her own standalone Intermission Episode. 
The following games are also available on July 19:
Marvel’s Avengers | PS5, PS4
Assassin's Creed Unity | PS4
Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag | PS4
Assassin's Creed Rogue Remastered | PS4
Assassin's Creed Freedom Cry | PS4
Assassin's Creed: The Ezio Collection | PS4
Saints Row IV: Re-Elected | PS4
Saints Row Gat out of Hell | PS4
Spirit of the North: Enhanced Edition | PS5
Ice Age: Scrat's Nutty Adventure | PS4
Jumanji The Video Game | PS4
Paw Patrol on a Roll! | PS4
ReadySet Heroes | PS4
And finally, the classic catalog for Premium members includes:
No Heroes Allowed! (PSP)

Bird Snapper is a nice little free game that's just you, an endless grey desert, a bicycle, a howling night, and innumerable antennae and electricity pylons.

        <updated>2022-07-13T15:52:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During last September's Nintendo Direct, Bayonetta's reemergence shocked fans, with the titular witch dodging, transforming, and shooting her way through huge monstrosities. We knew that the action romp would come exclusively to Switch this year, but today Nintendo announced an October 28 release date with an appropriately over-the-top trailer. 


Platinum Games' enemy and hero designs for the franchise remain stunning. Bayonetta sports butterfly wings and tentacled horns in some action sequences, while enemies take the form of armored animals – homunculi, artificial bioweapons. You'll fire canons from a moving train in a ravaged cityscape, ride grotesque crabs up skyscrapers, and even play as the new katana-wielding witch-in-training, Viola. And let's not forget that you can summon an all-powerful kaiju too. It's all wild and nonsensical as you'd expect but in the best possible way. 

Bayonetta 3 ups the ante on Switch this October 28. A Trinity Masquerade Edition of the game will also be available, boasting a 200-page art book. More details for the special version of the game will be revealed later.]]></summary>

The latest spin-off from The Witcher trilogy (and technically the spin-off of the standalone Gwent spin-off), Gwent: Rogue Mage puts you in charge of two mages, Alzur and Lyliana, attempting to create the very first Witcher hundreds of years before Geralt’s adventures. They do this by apparently journeying over a board of randomised roguelike encounters, stopping at each one for either a Gwent battle or an event, before facing off against a final boss to bag a mutagen needed for their radical experiments.

The rest? 1) WRO; 2) NYYVR; and other babblings of a newborn trying to make sense of the world. They might seem unhinged – they are, a bit – but they're signs of an experience that was really quite fun, and incredibly, made me feel quite clever.

Nonetheless, there are still a fair few offers still running on the WD Blue SN570, a seasoned member of the best SSDs club owing to its high PCIe 3.0 speeds and relatively affordable pricing.


It’s even more affordable now, of course, especially if you’ve got an Amazon Prime account and are in the UK. The 1TB and 2TB models – both capacious enough to act as your PC’s sole storage drive – have Prime-exclusive savings on Amazon UK, with the 1TB SN570 a few quid cheaper than it was during last year’s Black Friday sales.

To save you the bother of sifting through a mighty mountain of bargain bin junk, I've been collecting agreeable Amazon deals on actually good PC hardware right here.
Unlike the kinds of offers you’d find during, say, Black Friday, all the best Prime Day offers are only available to Amazon Prime subscribers. If you don't have a membership, you could always sign up for Prime's 30-day free trial - more on that in our guide to everything you need to know about Prime Day, which you can also find further down.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Prime Day 2022 comes just as the global graphics card market slowly emerges from a devastating crypto-coma. That means some prices are back to normal, some aren’t, and the entire concept of a deal becomes kind of nebulous and squishy. And yet, there will undoubtedly be people out there desperate for a new graphics card – any new graphics card – so let’s take a look at what’s out there.


The bad news is that the vast majority of Prime Day GPU “deals” still reach above the respective card’s original retail price. The good news is that I’ve found a small handful of offers that are, if nothing else, good value by the incredibly whacked-out standards of the past two years. First up, there are a couple of Nvidia GeForce RTX 30 series cards worth considering in the UK, including an MSI-made RTX 3070 (that Ebuyer have price matched). Sticking with RTX cards, which can run both DLSS and DLAA, GameStop have a reasonable RTX 3060 deal for US buyers.

One to four players roll their Kirby through four rounds of food-themed obstacle courses, and whoever collects the most strawberries by the end wins. As seen in the trailer, players can use new cuisine-inspired copy abilities to gain the upper hand. That includes morphing into a cupcake that vacuums multiple food items or turning into sentient chocolate bars to perform Kirby’s signature rock slam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With temperatures rising in certain parts of the world and summer heat still going strong in North America, Nintendo issued a heatwave warning to Switch players, suggesting the console can only be used in temperatures up to 35 degrees Celsius or 95 degrees Fahrenheit. While that heat cap is pretty impressive, we'd recommend not testing it. 
By way of Nintendo Life, Eurogamer referenced Nintendo Japan's Customer Service Twitter account, which advised Switch owners to avoid staggeringly high temperatures and keep the intake and exhaust ports unblocked.  The good news is that if the console gets too hot, it’ll automatically sleep. And for those who like to play using the Switch port, keep the setup in a cool spot. You can see the tweet below with a translation:
気温が高い場所でNintendo Switchを使用すると、本体の温度が高くなる場合があります。5～35℃の場所で使用してください。

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If the word "simulator" in PowerWash Simulator puts you off, please don't let it. Where other simulators double down on the minutiae surrounding the thing you're meant to be doing, that they put you off the thing you're meant to be doing, PowerWash Sim understands that you just want to rid surfaces of grime in the most satisfying way possible. You do not need to prize open your powerwasher with a tri-wing screwdriver or manage your finances via a convoluted banking app or determine whether a kitchen sink delivers enough pressure. Instead, you wash things with power: you power wash. You wash, powerfully.
After a year in early access, the game's launching in full with a variety of modes and I cannot stress enough how stress-less the experience is. This is a first-person soother you'll either think is an absolute bore or the best kind of meditative chore.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Supermassive Games is known for its interactive horror narratives, including 2015's Until Dawn, The Dark Pictures Anthology, and, more recently, The Quarry. Today, Eurogamer reported that Danish company Nordisk Games acquired the studio.
Nordisk Games, which already owns Just Cause developer Avalanche Studios and MercurySteam, the team behind Metroid Dread, acquired a 30% stake in Supermassive in March 2021. At the time, Supermassive CEO Pete Samuels said:
Today, Samuels released another statement about the studios' full acquisition that matched his excitement from a year ago:
We enjoyed The Quarry, awarding the summer camp slasher an 8.5 out of 10 and concluding the review by saying, "Once the frantic running through the woods begins, the dark mysteries and thrill of keeping people alive are powerful hooks that will keep you glued in suspense until the credits roll." However, the finale to Season One of The Dark Pictures Anthology, The Devil in Me, is Supermassive's next big project. Starring Jessie Buckley, you can watch the trailer here.

However, while the game features many tenants of the open-world genre, Sonic Team is adamant about calling Frontiers an "open-zone" game instead. While on the surface that sounds like little more than a marketing ploy, after chatting with the developers, it makes more sense as you dig deeper into its meaning.
Coming off 2017's Sonic Forces, a game that didn't fare well with critics or fans, the development team wanted to shake things up. Forces received criticism for its generic 3D level design, unfulfilling story, short length, and poor 2D gameplay compared to the then-newly released Sonic Mania. According to Sonic Frontiers director Morio Kishimoto (who a…]]></summary>

For context, Ubisoft recently announced it will cease online services for several of its titles on September 1, of which Liberation HD is among them. In particular, the PC versions of these titles will not only lose their online features but their DLC will be rendered inaccessible, even if you purchased it.

To me, the Steam Deck did not do anything not already covered by the four different video game boxes I already own. The largest advantage afforded by the Steam Deck, the ability to play cool games on a handheld device, was surely the domain of the Nintendo Switch - a console that I personally use about once a year. Usually the process is that I go "Oh yeah!", pick up the Switch, and contemplate buying Breath Of The Wild before I see that it has not depreciated in value whatsoever since it came out five years ago. Then I turn off the Switch. 
Last week, though, I picked up the Switch, saw that Tangle Tower was on sale, and played it through in one go. "This is great!", I thought, marvelling at how I could play a game while sitting on the sofa, but leaving the TV free for my partner to watch whatever stupid TV show he wanted. I went to look for other cool indie games that might be on sale on the Switch, and that's when I discovered that the Switch eshop is hot garbage unless you know specifically what you're looking for. So now I want a Switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After over a decade of game development, Last Call BBS is the curtain call for prolific indie studio Zachtronics. Released only a month after the studio casually announced it would be disbanding, Last Call BBS will be the last game the studio releases. It's a bittersweet feeling for fans, but this final game is not just a goodbye, it's a retrospective dive into the studio’s ten-year-plus run making games. It also acts as a reminder of how flipping good Zachtronics is at making puzzle games, even if they do melt my brain into a puddle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to some recent job postings on Respawn Entertainment's career webpage, a new single-player FPS set in the Apex Legends universe is in early development. Eurogamer asks if this could be the long-awaited Titanfall 3 in disguise, but that remains to be seen since the posts don't mention anything about the wall-running, mech warfare FPS.
Referred to as "Apex Universe FPS Incubation Title," a Senior Environment Artist post states:
A single-player FPS is not often announced, especially since the genre is synonymous with competitive play. A story-centric Apex Legends experience could focus on any number of the frontiers' eccentric personalities. It could even delve into Blisk's notorious Apex Predator squadron. In any case, the upcoming shooter would be in good company, seeing as its predecessor is still the best battle royale out right now.
What do you make of this Apex Universe FPS Incubation Title? Where would the story take returning and new players, and what would you like to see? Let us know in the comments below.

That's what Robocop is programmed to do, and you'll soon get the chance to see the world through his visor in Robocop: Rogue City, a new game from developer Teyon and publisher Nacon. Peter Weller, the actor who became Robocop in the feature film, is reprising his role, bringing both his likeness and voice to this iconic '80s character.
The trailer above shows off roughly one minute of gameplay. Robocop's precision targeting is on display, as is his brute strength, which he uses to effortlessly push dumpsters and hurl enemies through the air. Rogue City tells a new story set around the same time as Paul Verhoeven's movie and somehow brings the powerful reboot ED-209 back into the mix.
Teyon is the development house that released Terminator: Resistance. which recently was enhanced for new-gen machines. Robocop: Rogue City is slated to release in June 2023 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.]]></summary>

Pokémon Puzzle League launched in 2000 and tells an original story based on the anime, with Ash and Pikachu competing in a special puzzle tournament. The pair takes on familiar faces, including Team Rocket and Gary, in 2D and 3D puzzle contests, with plenty of Pokémon cheering from the sidelines.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this week, I had a real blast from the past moment. Apparently, my ancient LiveJournal turned 18 on Tuesday, a thing I haven't posted in or given a single thought to for at least ten years. Naturally, curiosity got the better of me, so I dipped my toe back in to see what teenage Katharine had been blogging about in the mid to late 00s. Aside from all my custom images having been eaten, probably with the closure of whatever photo upload service I used back in the day, everything else was pretty much in tact. 
But man alive. Those OPINIONS. Just terrible. Bad, awful, narrow-minded. In some ways it's quite funny looking back at how angry I was about Nintendo putting trains in a Zelda game, for example (joke's on me, Spirit Tracks would go on to become one of my fav Zelda games of all time), but in many ways I'm just quite glad I've (hopefully) moved on as a person, if only because recent weeks have reminded me there are still plenty of people out there like late 00s Katharine who are in all likelihood the same age I am now. Yes, I'm talking about the backlash to Return Of Monkey Island.

The few I tried were fussy, though, and too much like the kind of cold scientific procedure that turns growing things into industry. With Lost Nova on my back burner I shrugged, and gave that a go, having frankly forgotten what it was.
It's a gathering game, so almost the reverse of gardening, or perhaps the end point of it. But its relaxed pace, warm tone, and fun dialogue were, it turns out, exactly what I needed. There's no pressure, and not too much to worry about. You can just wander about enjoying the vibe and digging things up with your gentle laser as you go.

So, with Monster Hunter Rise netting itself a bestest best badge and its Sunbreak expansion getting some serious praise in our review, I thought it was time to pull up my regular socks in the hopes that I could replace them with a pair woven from a big lizard's gooch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Madison is a fun game to write about. It's a puzzle horror game set in your traditional haunted house, aiming at a P.T. or Layers Of Fear vibe down the viewfinder of a Polaroid camera. Said camera was a second-hand gift for Luca's (that's you!) 16th birthday. It is also possessed by a demon, which is where the fun comes in, "fun" here meaning jump scares and hallucinatory clocks. Let that be a lesson to anyone thinking of getting their son something that was evidence in a murder as a present. This is one of many bad choices characters in Madison made. They are mostly now dead.
The game itself sometimes makes very good choices, though it's about 50/50 that it goes a bit too weird and ends up being silly. This makes for an intriguing mixture, especially with a complicated story of murder and neglect spanning decades, and by the end I was extremely fond of the way the sublime and the ridiculous sat side by side. The main let down isn't that Madison sometimes makes you giggle by accident, but that its multi-stage puzzles become so drawn out that you stop jumping at creepy angels and terrifying violin squeals. You've got numbers to write down and candles to move, and you don't have time for any demonic antics right now, godammit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Lord of the Rings: Gollum's long journey to release nears its end, and after getting a release date and story trailer in May, curious fans can finally see what gameplay looks like in a new video. 
A short trailer provides a montage of the stealth-oriented gameplay as well as Gollum’s emphasis on climbing and platforming to traverse Middle-earth landmarks. The game looks noticeably rough considering it’s launching in two months which is worrisome, but hopefully, it plays better than it appears at the moment. 


The Lord of the Rings: Gollum launches September 1 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. The game is also coming to Switch sometime later this year.]]></summary>

I’m sure you’ll be thoroughly creeped out when you watch it below.

First someone got FSR 2.0 working in Cyberpunk 2077, then someone modded the Cyberpunk mod to get FSR in Dying Light 2, and then someone discovered the mod of the mod could also mod Metro Exodus. Now, redditor Muddymind has figured out how to tweak the Metro mod so that it can act as an Nvidia DLAA clone, skipping the upscaling bit to solely provide better image quality and anti-aliasing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s Nacon Connect event included gritty antiheroes such as the Terminator and RoboCop, but I never would’ve expected to see Robin Hood there too. Appeal Studios’ Gangs Of Sherwood is an upcoming third-person PvE co-op action game that puts you in the dainty shoes of the Merry Men. This time though, it’s set in a dystopian future instead of Ye Merry Olde England. Watch the announcement teaser below to see what you think of that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new The Lord Of The Rings: Gollum trailer has dropped at today's Nacon Connect, which shows Mr Precious scamper about in some suitably fantastical locations. He hops between some bushes, dodges a dragon, and chucks something at an orc - all the staples of a Hobbit who's gone goblin mode. I'm still a bit on the fence about it, though.

Will you be able to play as Terminators? It's not yet clear. Heck, it's so early on the game doesn't even have a proper name yet. Feel free to recoil in fear from the announcement teaser trailer below.

Or both! The first proper trailer of the game confirms only that it'll definitely be a mid-budget first-person shooter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's fair to say that Skull And Bones has had a somewhat troubled development. Ubisoft's pirate-themed live service MMO has been knocking around for almost a decade, having been overhauled a couple of times since it started life as a DLC for Asassin's Creed IV: Black Flag. But at a stream tonight it was revealed that Skull And Bones still exists, and not only that, but it has a release date of November 8th, 2022. Still a few months left to delay it again if necessary, but fingers crossed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in the mists of time, I actually had a hands on with Ubisoft's pirate 'em up Skull And Bones once. In my memory of it, I was an adolescent, which was categorically not the case and probably more a product of the booths at Gamescom being very tall, not to mention the hands on taking place so very long ago. At that time, the game was essentially the naval combat bit from AC: Black Flag, carved out and extended to be its own thing. Now, years later and with many delays and reworks bobbing about in its wake, Skull And Bones is back, and looking a bit different.
The current state of play for Skull And Bones was revealed with a livestream tonight, featuring an explainer video walking you through some of the game features, a chonk of the game in piratical action, and a surprisingly close release date confirmation for the 8th of November 2022 (there's still time for it to be delayed again!). All those extra months in the oven have produced a decidedly Sea Of Thieves-shaped bun. But this one is all realistic and gritty, more complicated, and is taking itself seriously. You won't catch Skull And Bones announcing its new season features with a comedy song, that's for sure.

The world of Aionios is in a perpetual state of war, endlessly engulfed in flame and littered with corpses. Countries Keves and Agnus love to hate each other, and both factions' armies pay the price. To make matters worse, these seemingly mass-produced soldiers are cursed with short, 10-year lifespans. The goal, then, is to endure front-line service and be forever immortalized in the Homecoming ceremony, an honorable send-off for Aionios' most tenacious survivors. 
I meet Noah, Eunie, and Lanz, during the latter stage of their lifespans (or terms). The leading trio has slain their fair share of Agnusians and watched many beloved…]]></summary>

Inscryption

The PS5/PS4 version of the horror deck builder features exclusive features, such as the talking Stoat card's audio coming through the controller speaker, haptic feedback support, and atmospheric lighting that, accordion to creator Daniel Mullens, "spills out from your controller."

The Devil In Me was revealed last October, and it will be the finale to Season One of The Dark Pictures Anthology. It stars Jessie Buckley, who you can see in today's new trailer, and seems to feature many horror elements that lean on the Saw franchise. There are fatal booby traps, maze-like halls, shifting walls, and more. Whatever this house in The Devil In Me is, one thing is for sure: it's a house of horrors inspired by the infamous hotel of serial killer H.H. Holmes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Japanese artist Kazuki Takahashi, the creator behind the mega-popular Yu-Gi-Oh! manga, has died at 60. 
This news comes from reports from Japanese public broadcaster NHK, as reported by IGN. According to information coming from Japan, Takahashi was found floating in shallow waters on the coast of Nago City on the Island of Okinawa by the country’s Coast Guard yesterday, July 6. He was wearing snorkeling gear when found by the Coast Guard. Both the Coast Guard and local police are investigating his death. 
Takahashi’s manga career began in 1982, but it didn’t truly take off until the release of Yu-Gi-Oh! in 1996. In between his start and Yu-Gi-Oh!, though, Takahashi published titles like Fighting Hawk and Tennenshoku Danji Buray, according to Kotaku. After Yu-Gi-Oh! hit shelves in 1996, the series only continued to grow in popularity, spawning a real-life card game in 1999 (that’s still extremely popular today) as well as multiple anime series. Today, the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise spans not just manga, card games, and anime, but video games as well, like this year’s Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following a scant seven months of availability, The Matrix Awakens: An Unreal Engine 5 Experience will be leaving digital console storefronts on July 9. 
According to the Matrix Awakens website, those who add the tech demo to their library on PlayStation 5 and/or Xbox Series X will still be able to launch and mess around with the experience after the delisting date. Here’s what the official site has to say on the matter: 
The Matrix Awakens was first announced and made available on the same night during the 2021 Game Awards. The Unreal Engine 5-powered demonstration from Epic Games stars Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss, who introduces the impressive graphics engine and how close to real-life its visuals can look. Awakens includes an on-rails car shootout throughout a city that often looks like it was ripped from the silver screen despite being rendered on the spot. The demo then lets you roam the massive pre-populated city and change things like time of day or traffic congestion to flex what UE5 is capable of. It’s a terrific showcase for the future of games, so if you haven’t given it a download yet, you’ll want to check it out before the delisting on Saturday.
You can watch us tour The Matrix Awakens in this episode of New Gameplay Today.]]></summary>

Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth comes to PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on September 29, the same day that Valkyrie Elysium launches. It will be sold separately for a yet-to-be-announced price. You can also get it as part of the $74.99 Digital Deluxe Edition of Valkyrie Elysium.]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-07-06T14:59:37.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is one of the most popular open-world fantasy RPGs ever made for several reasons, including its in-universe card game, Gwent. 
CD Projekt Red, the studio behind Wild Hunt and 2020’s Cyberpunk 2077, has already created a game based on Gwent, aptly called Gwent: The Witcher Card Game, but it seems the developer is not ready to leave that in-universe game behind just yet. That’s because the studio is launching Gwent: Rogue Mage, a new single-player roguelike deckbuilder, tomorrow. 
Announced by IGN, Gwent: Rogue Mage launches tomorrow, July 7, on PC, iOS, and Android. IGN reports that this game is what Project Golden Nekker, which the team revealed earlier this year, has turned into, and CD Projekt Red is marketing it as a single-player expansion to Gwent: The Witcher Card Game. However, you won’t need to own that because Rogue Mage is standalone. You can purchase the standalone version for $9.99 or the premium edition, which includes in-game skins and cosmetics, and card packs for the multiplayer portion of Gwent, for $19.99. 
“Rogue Mage came out of us noticing that years after The Witcher 3’s release, there are a significant number of players who want a more PvE experience from Gwent,” game director Vladimir Tortsov told IGN. “While Gwent multiplayer is a fantastic game for those who are looking for a great PvP multiplayer experience, we perfectly understand that many Witcher players loved the original mini-game of Gwent for totally different reasons. With Rogue Mage, we aim to give this audience a reason to play modern-day Gwent in the format they prefer.” 
IGN has an exclusive preview of Gwent: Rogue Mage after going hands-on with it ahead of tomorrow’s release, and if you’re looking for even more details about it, including what this single-player deckbuilder roguelike’s gameplay is like, be sure to check it out.

        <updated>2022-07-06T14:46:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Valkyrie Elysium, the next entry in the previously dormant Valkyrie Profile series, has a new gameplay trailer and a pair of release dates.
The new video provides a lengthier look at the game’s action-oriented combat and story compared to its more enigmatic debut trailer back in March. 


Square Enix also announced special editions and pre-order bonuses containing extra goodies based on the platform. Pre-ordering Valkyrie Elysium on PlayStation gets you the Alscir: Sword of the God of Light in-game item and a special themed avatar. The $74.99 Digital Deluxe Edition includes 72-hour early access, the Svartaljr: Sword of the Goddess of the Underworld in-game weapon, and a digital copy of Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth, the 2006 PSP port of the first Valkyrie Profile game. 
Don't worry, fans. Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth will also be sold separately on PS5/PS4 on September 29, so you don’t need to buy the Digital Deluxe Edition to play it. Additionally, after buying Elysium on PS4, you’ll also get access to the PS5 version. 
Pre-ordering Valkyrie Elysium on Steam grants the 72-hour early access window and unique wallpapers. Its Digital Deluxe version also tosses in the Svartaljr: Sword of the Goddess of the Underworld. 
Valkyrie Elysium will launch first on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on September 29. It then arrives on Steam on November 11.]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-07-06T14:04:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Forspoken, Square Enix’s upcoming action RPG, will no longer launch in October and has been pushed to January 24.
In a post on the game’s Twitter page, developer Luminous Productions, a team made up of Final Fantasy XV developers, states that Forspoken is largely complete and is in the final polishing phase. It describes the delay as a “strategic decision” and that we’ll learn more about the game in the near future. 
Forspoken is no stranger to delays, as it was originally slated to arrive on May 24 before getting pushed to October 11. Though this second delay isn’t as long, it’s disappointing that we won’t get to experience Frey Holland’s adventure this year, but we trust that the delay will only help get the game up to snuff. The adventure drops Frey, a modern-day New Yorker, in the fantasy world of Athia where she acquires magical powers and a sentient talking bracelet. She’ll use her newfound abilities to free Athia from tyranny while also searching for a way back to her world. 
Forspoken graced Game Informer’s cover in March, and you can catch up on a month’s worth of exclusive features and videos here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's a great day to be a God of War fan, and not just because PlayStation and Sony Santa Monica released a new cinematic trailer for God of War: Ragnarok that contains the release date. That's because, alongside that cinematic "Father and Son" trailer, the studio has released a new unboxing video for the game's Collector's and Jötnar editions. 
As you might expect, both editions of Ragnarok look fantastic. It doesn't hurt that both come in a fancy Knowledge Keeper's Shrine box that features beautiful artwork and plenty of fun goodies inside. Check them both out for yourself in the trailer below: 


As you can see in the trailer above, you can't go wrong with either edition. But, if you're like me and struggling to determine which one you want, hopefully this breakdown of what's in each wil…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PlayStation and Sony Santa Monica Studio have released a brand new God of War: Ragnarok trailer, revealing that the highly-anticipated follow-up to 2018's God of War will be released this November. 
More specifically, Ragnarok will hit PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on November 9, meaning we're less than five months away from playing the game. The new trailer released today is short and sweet but still packs a godly punch. Clocking in at just 30 seconds, we see Kratos and Atreus fending off some standard mob enemies before coming face to face with a gigantic black wolf. 
Check out the cinematic "Father and Son" trailer for yourself below: 


Fans of Norse mythology might recognize this beast as Fenrir, the son of Loki. Fenrir plays a significant part in the Norse story of Ragnarok, but we won't spoil that here. Plus, Ragnarok's take on Fenrir could be completely different anyway. Only time will tell, but fortunately, we don't have to wait long because God of War: Ragnarok hits PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on November 9, 2022.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Guerrilla Games and PlayStation have been steady at work, making Horizon Forbidden West an even better game than it was at launch with updates that add transmog, fix visual shimmering, improve graphics, and more. Months later, the team is still adding new things to the game, which is exactly what today’s Patch 1.17 does for the open-world RPG. 
More specifically, Patch 1.17 brings three new things to the game: variable refresh rate (VRR) support, high refresh rate (HFR) support, and a new “Balanced” graphics mode that introduces a 40Hz refresh rate for displays that support it. 


The game only supports VRR on monitors or TVs that feature VRR and if yours does, you can expect improved “dynamic resolution scaling on 60Hz.” Both VRR and HFR target a refresh rate between 60Hz and 120Hz, so if…]]></summary>
