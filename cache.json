And then, as these stories usually do, it ends in murder. On a train! But don't be fooled by the plentiful Agatha Christie-isms: this work of whodunnitry is wholly unique while paying tribute to its influences, and may even be one of our favourite modern point-and-clicks.\nIn the astoundingly well-named Loco Motive, you play as three separate characters – Arthur, a paperwork-loving estate attorney; Herman Merman, a crime novel-author-turned-detective; and Diana, a spy and bounty hunter working for the Inland Revenue Service, which we really hope isn't a real thing. These three are your guides as you try to piece together the mysterious and sudden murder of a rich matriarch on a train through a series of goofy, absurd item combinations, interspersed with plot twists, reveals, and comedic cutscenes.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "But it's likely several years away.\nWe know what you're thinking, and yes, it certainly feels like rumours of a new PlayStation handheld have been swirling since... well, probably since the launch of the Vita. But now, we have a slightly more credible report from Bloomberg (thanks, VGC), claiming that Sony may well be developing a new 'PSP' to compete more directly with Nintendo.\nAccording to Bloomberg, development of a new handheld is in the early stages and, much like Microsoft's planned portable device, likely won't launch for some years to come. As such, the company may still decide against bringing it to market, though given the remarkable success of the Switch and the hype surrounding its successor, we honestly wouldn't be surprised if Sony dipped its toes further back into the world of handheld gaming.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "\"Cats are amazing animals\".\nStray caught everyone a little by surprise when it first leapt onto PlayStation consoles back in 2022. A cyberpunk platformer where you play as a cute kitty sure looked sweet, but it was surprisingly heartfelt? Surprisingly fun to play? And (un)surprisingly drove any real-world cats in its vicinity wild? We weren't expecting that.\nThings blew up really rather fast, with the cat platformer (catformer?) going on to be nominated at just about every awards show going. It even picked up a few big ones, including Best Independent Game at The Game Awards. Having clawed its way onto Xbox last year, we imagined it was only a matter of time before the cute kitty made its way to Switch. And right we were. Stray slinked into the June 2024 Nintendo Direct, with a November 19th release date following shortly after.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "The enemies of survival shooter Stalker 2 have a funny habit of showing up right behind you, like a panto villain with an AK-47. Far from being a premeditated ambush by intelligent AI-controlled soldiers, this is just a result of the game's janky spawns. Those botched encounters are unlike previous games, where roaming bands of factional murderfolk would patrol the radioactive wastes, seemingly according to their own whims. Back in the day, this wandering baddies feature was dubbed \"A-life\" by developers GSC Game World - basically a jargon word for the simulation of enemies that would lead to \"emergent\" moments of violence and conflict. It was promised as a feature in Stalker 2 but many players have noticed it seems to be absent. Over the weekend, GSC insisted the simulation is technically present in the sequel. It's just broken.\nRead more",

          "description": "If you’re a fan of Warhammer 40k, you know John Blanche. Even if it’s you’re first time hearing his name, you’ll be familiar with his fingerprints on some of the setting’s most defining artwork. He’s responsible for that iconic imagine of the emprah - the one the best shows off the dark irony of a such a wretched figure becoming an idol of worship. While the term ‘grimdark’ originates from 40k’s \"in the grim darkness of the far future…\" tagline, grimdark as an aesthetic is one Blanche pioneered. There’s even a style of miniature painting - Blanchitsu - named after him.\nBasically, even games that don’t use the 40k license owe an incredible amount to Blanche’s work. That’s not to mention his influence on the fantasy setting of the Total War: Warhammer series either. His piece Harry The Hammer was the cover for the first edition of Fantasy Battle - recently added to the strategy game as chaos hero Harold Hammerstorm. I could go on, and I might do so in a bit, but here’s the news: Trademark Films are making a documentary on Blanche’s work, starring Napoleon Dynamite actor Jon Heder. It’s called The Grim And The Dark: The Search For John Blanche, and it’s out next Spring. Here’s a trailer:\nRead more",

Speaking at the G-STAR Conference in Busan earlier this month, recently appointed chief executive officer Shams Jorjani confirmed that Arrowhead are looking into such collaborations, giving the example of refitting your dropship to look like one of Halo's Pelicans, or introducing the Zerg from Blizzard's Starcraft as an enemy faction. \nJorjani cautioned listeners, however, that these injections of third-party DNA need to look and feel appropriate to the setting. After all, if you start fecklessly chucking the Zerg, Chaos Space Marines or Fifth Element's, er, flying taxis into Helldivers 2, it might spoil the meticulous coherency of a game in which saluting protects you against lethal falls and some guy called Joel is running the universe. The funny part is that according to Jorjani, Arrowhead once envisaged a system that would get round the problem of inconsistency by essentially making third-party cosmetics, including whole map skins, visible only to players who have them enabled. To put that another way, Arrowhead once envisaged a system in which individual Helldivers would hallucinate other licenses.\n  \nRead more",

The game in question, Boktai: The Sun Is In Your Hand, is a Game Boy Advance title from 2003, in which you play a vampire-slaying gunslinger. The gun you're slinging is a \"solar-powered\" pistol, which you could charge up using a cartridge-mounted photometric sensor by physically standing in sunshine. This was 13 years before the launch of Pokemon Go. Sadly, Boktai's debut didn't result in city parks or rooftops being flooded by crowds of GBA-wielding undead killers. But it was a fun gimmick and the game itself is good enough to carry it - an isometric dungeon-crawler in which you have to find a vamp's coffin and drag it to the surface for purgation.\n Read more",

Some try to sound badass, some might as well have been chosen by the owner panickedly looking around the room for something to name himself after, and all of them sound like they should be on the actor's wall in Toast of London.\nBecause your life partly depends on relieving slain foes of their belongings, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 encourages you to get up close and looty with these blokes, meaning you end up spending a lot of time reading goofy nicknames.

Do you consider its brain-jacking of rando cityfolk for monster-hunting purposes a sad waste of potential?

The one major criticism I have after 20 minutes or so is that the flat pixelart perspective makes walls and walkable surfaces look interchangeable, and this feels more like a question of acclimatisation than a real complaint.\n Read more",

These games, I am convinced, were never really designed to be completed, but to be played exactly like this, as a coin-gobbling invitation to become a bandana-wearing sisyphus, a tiny Rambo pushing a bouncy, juddering tank up a hill occupied by cartoon nazis. You die a bunch and say: \"ah, that was good.\"\nSo what happens when you rearrange the molecules of this run and/or gun 'em up into an isometric turn-based strategy game? You get Metal Slug Tactics, an off-kilter nod to Into The Breach and other grid-based turn-takers, but secretly housing the aggressive notions of an unhinged pyromaniac. You still die a lot.

I reviewed Digital Extremes' hit free-to-play shooter in 2013, back when people were still calling it a spiritual successor to the developer's boomerang-throwing action game Dark Sector. I didn't like Warframe much at the time. Think I gave it a 6/10. Warp forward a decade, and that 6/10 game has become a thriving live service phenomenon - fifteenth on the Steam Most Played charts at the time of writing, and profitable enough to spawn its own annual TennoCon expo. It's also become an intoxicating, confusing morass of dynastic sci-fantasy politicking and genre-shifting expansions, ranging from capital ship mechanics to questions of time travel, wrapped in layers of cosmetics that make Destiny look about as colourful as Gears Of War. \r\n\n\r\nI definitely didn't see all that coming. I doubt Digital Extremes saw it coming either. Warframe today feels like a lab experiment run amok. I love its appetite for novelty, but there's a lot for a returning player to catch up on and, frankly, it feels like homework. As such, I had a couple of broad motivations for playing Soulframe's pre-alpha \"prelude\": I'm keen to see what Digital Extremes can do when they aren't encumbered by 10 years of world-building, and I want to get in on the ground floor before they absolutely swamp this thing in updates.\r\n \nRead more",

The digital store was the subject of a report by the Anti-Defamation League last week, which claimed to find millions of examples of \"hateful or extremist\" language and images hosted on Steam's community. These include things like Nazi symbols in profile pictures, white supremacist slogans in group names, and yet more discriminatory spew in user posts. The senator has noticed this report, and now writes directly to Gabe Newell, demanding that Valve \"bring its content moderation practices in line with industry standards\" or risk \"intense scrutiny\" from the government.\nRead more",

That is, coming up with a set of game inputs that can win billions of possible permutations of the game, as determined by its RNG, when played simultaneously.

There I was, just starting to get to grips with the card-house-careful balance between each of its units when, bam, makers Game River dropped a Jenga block on top of it. It’s a stealth block, too. Didn’t even see it coming.\nUpdate 1.1’s new unit is the Phantom Ray, which Game River describe as \"a medium-sized aircraft with high HP that excels at striking enemies at close range with high-damage missiles\". It’s a mid-tier flier, costing 50 to unlock and 200 to field, and for that you get three of them per unit. As for default tech, you’ve got some range and fire rate unlocks, alongside an oil drop. The headliner here is the stealth buff, which cloaks the Phantom Ray by default until it attacks. When it does, it all gets a nice 40% bonus to damage.\nRead more",

Introduced on Razer’s Huntsman V3 Pro series and quickly followed by Wooting’s (functionally distinct but effectively identical) Rappy Snappy, Snap Tap is now wearing multiple names as it takes over the world of RGB peripherals, from SteelSeries’ Rapid Tap to Corsair’s FlashTap and Keychron’s... Last Keystroke Prioritisation. Which doesn’t sound as sexy, but still.\nHowever, Snap Tap is also drawing a level of ire that exceeds the usual baseline scepticism of hardware marketing. Because it enables a form of input automation – where you can quickly move in two directions by rapidly tapping one key, while holding down another – it’s considered by some as tantamount to cheating, allowing players to cross the line that divides unfair play from the accepted comforts that come with simply using a responsive Hall Effect keyboard or high-refresh-rate monitor. It’s even become a bannable offence in certain games, most notably in Counter-Strike 2.\nNeither side is backing down; in an astonishingly worded tweet, Wooting went as far as to concede Snap Tap \"should be considered cheating. But if it’s allowed, you need it.\" But do you?\nRead more",

          "description": "Well, that was quick. After artwork leaked last week for what looked very much like a remaster of classic real-time strategy Warcraft II: Tides Of Darkness, Blizzard sneakily dropped both that and a remaster of Warcraft: Orcs & Humans last night. They’re bundled together with Warcraft III: Reforged - itself with a new patch - in a 'Warcraft Remastered Battle Chest', which also includes the older versions of the first two games. The chest is available on Battle.net, where it’ll set you back £34.99 / $39.99. If you’re just after the older titles, they’re £9 / $10 and £12.59 / $15 respectively.\nRead more",

Now, though, GOG have declared a renewed focus on not just selling aged games, but on tweaking more of them to work on non-aged hardware.

He’s got ill designs on the world. Your Dad tried to stop him, and he died. He fell into a volcano. We absolutely can’t be having that.\nThis is, more than anything else, a game about Going On An Adventure. Well walked ground, of course, but it’s rare to see it embarked upon with such barefaced delight, or such a wholehearted commitment to going the distance. It is a very big and a very simple RPG that is as wide as an ocean and as deep as a pond; a game to curl up with and play lazily and—with some sour caveats—enjoyably, for an entire winter.\nRead more",

Young’uns these days just don’t appreciate how revolutionary it was to be able to hit a cop with a thing after he’d already fallen over. Suffice it to say I’ve got good memories of the open world series’ nascent forays into 3D, though never enough to tempt me into revisiting them, especially given the poor reception to Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition. I can sympathise. I’m annoyed just having to type a colon and a dash in the same game name.\nIf you’re in a similarly non-fussed position (I will never not be annoyed that ‘nonplussed’ doesn’t mean what it sounds like it should mean) I can’t imagine a lighting update that’s been available on the mobile versions for a while is enough to tempt you back. But what is a reporter's job if not pathetically treading water between chunklets of Grand Theft Auto news, upon the publishing of which Graham presses the button to release the nutritious pellets on which we all wholly subsist?

For those wanting to quantify the performance difference between eight and twelve memory channels with AMD EPYC 9005 \"Turin\" processors, here are some benchmarks for showing the workloads that can really benefit from all 12 memory channels and other workloads where eight memory channels can be largely sufficient if looking to minimize costs.",

I don't think anyone thought a show based on League of Legends would be a masterclass in well-written character relationships, pacing, and environmental storytelling. And with its last season over, fans are hungry for something to fill the void it's leaving.\n\n\nArcane dips its beautifully animated toes into many literary genres: steampunk, science fantasy, political thriller, romance, drama, and, of course, tragedy. While it's hard to think of a book that covers all the bases Arcane did as well as it did, plenty of books tackle one or more of them with just as much flair and bravery.\n\n\nJinx and Vi's story may have come to a close, but the ending of their tale could be the spark that launches you, like a graffitied rocket, into …",

Windows 11 version 24H2, Windows 11's third big update, is responsible for bricking many of Ubisoft's most popular releases recently. \n\n\nIt's an unfortunate issue, but Microsoft has already acknowledged it.\n\n\n“After installing Windows 11, version 24H2, you might encounter issues with some Ubisoft games,” and, “These games might become unresponsive while starting, loading or during active gameplay. In some cases, users might receive a black screen. ”\n\n\nThe affected games, as acknowledged by Microsoft, are:\n-Star Wars Outlaws\n-Assassin’s Creed Valhalla\n-Assassin’s Creed Origins\n-Assassin’s Creed Odyssey\n-Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora\n\n\nThe update in question does not roll out immediately, so Microsoft recommends you do not use Microsoft's tools to install it manually if you're into these games. The company stated:\n\n\n“We recommend that you do not attempt to manually update to version 24H2 using the Windows 11 Installation Assistant or the media creation tool until this issue has been resolved,”\n\n\nUbisoft has already released a temporary hotfix to make Star Wars Outlaws run for people who have already updated their systems. Still, the company warns that its software does not provide a complete solution to this issue.\n\n\n“We have just deployed a temporary hotfix (v1.4.1) for players who were experiencing issues playing on Windows 11 24H2,” and, “Please note that you may experience some performance issues while we work on a more permanent fix. As soon as it is ready, we will let you know.”\n\n\nWe still don't know which of the update's features is causing the issues, but Microsoft will likely provide more information as the situation evolves. Till then, we recommend anyone interested in any of Ubisoft's titles to put the idea of updating Windows 11 on hold.\n\n\n\n\nThe post Windows’ latest update prevents you from playing some Ubisoft games appeared first on Destructoid.",

Squad Total Chemistry Points: 31\n\n\n\nEA FC 25 FC Pro Live Challenge 1 SBC solutions\n\n\nWhile the priority is to use cards that are already present in your Ultimate Team collection, you can use the following solution to complete the challenge easily. \n\n\n\nPetermann ST 79\n\n\nDunst LM 80\n\n\nFreigang CAM 83\n\n\nCorley CAM 77\n\n\nJonsdottir RM 82\n\n\nLattwein CM 80\n\n\nRauch LB 82\n\n\nGarcia Posadas CM 59\n\n\nKohr CB 75\n\n\nLeinherne RB 80\n\n\nNubel GK 80\n\n\n\nAfter completing the challenge, you'll get a Premium Gold Players Pack.

          "description": "Aquatic Escargot in Disney Dreamlight Valley is a dish many would likely avoid in real life. However, some of your friends, like Stitch or Belle in the game, might love a bite of this three-star dish.\n\n\nAquatic Escargot Disney Dreamlight Valley ingredients\n\n\nTo cook up the Aquatic Escargot for yourself or restaurant guests, you'll need the following:\n\n\n\nTrumpet Snail\n\n\nSalt Crystal\n\n\nGarlic\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\n\nTrumpet Snails can be acquired at The Bind. You can find them on the ground like an herb. They look like a strange shell engrained in the soil. Garlic can also be picked up from the ground, but you'll have to go back to the Forest of Valor in the original valley where our story began. Look for the green stems that are reaching out of the ground.\n\n\nLastly, Salt Crystals can be fished from the waters of Everafter, Maleficent's dominion in the new land. Don't fish within the ripples, however. You'll want to fish from outside them to gain the Salt Crystal you require. Thankfully, you don't need to grow any crops for this recipe.\n\n\nOnce you have all of the ingredients, head to any cooking station, such as your home or Chez Remy. Throw the ingredients into the pot, and you'll have the Aquatic Escargot dish. Congrats! Hopefully, our French residents like Belle or The Beast will be happy.\n\n\nThere are many other dishes you can make in Disney Dreamlight Valley, and these will likely make you more Star Coins than the Aquatic Escargot. You can sell this meal to Goofy's Stall for 182 Star Coins or gain 581 Energy from eating it. \n\nThe post How to make Aquatic Escargot in Disney Dreamlight Valley appeared first on Destructoid.",

Thankfully, the ingredients are fairly easy to get.\n\n\nChia Seed Bread Disney Dreamlight Valley Ingredients\n\n\nFirst, you'll need to purchase the Disney Dreamlight Valley Storybook Vale DLC to access this recipe and its ingredients. Once that's done, the three-star dish Chia Seed Bread is made with the following ingredients: \n\n\n\nChia\n\n\nShovel Bird Egg\n\n\nWheat\n\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nChia Seeds can be purchased from Goofy's Stall in The Bind.

Thankfully, the Chia Seeds only take five minutes to grow after being planted and watered. \n\n\nThe last ingredient, Wheat, is also at Goofy's Stall, but you'll have to go back to the original valley. Head over to the Peaceful Meadow and visit one of Mickey's best friends there. His stall will have Wheat Seeds for 1 Star Coin. \n\n\nOnce you have all of the ingredients, go to any cooking station in your home or at Chez Remy and place them all in the pot. You should now have Chia Seed Bread. It can be sold for 122 Star Coins or be eaten for 478 Energy. \n\n\nOther recipes that can be made\n\n\nChia Seed Pudding is one of the easiest recipes to make in the Storybook Vale DLC expansion.

          "description": "Scottish Porridge in Disney Dreamlight Valley is a simple two-star recipe that would make residents like Merida very happy. It's made with a new ingredient that can be spotted in Everafter. \n\n\nScottish Porridge Disney Dreamlight Valley ingredients\n\n\nTo make Scottish Porridge, you only need two ingredients:\n\n\n\nOats\n\n\nAny fruit\n\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nSounds simple, right? This isn't made like the typical Porridge from the past, however, with just wheat and milk. You'll need to get the Oats ingredient from Goofy's Stall in The Wild Woods area. It's on the west side of Storybook Vale, where Everafter is located. After starting up the stall, you should have the oat seeds available. They're 150 Star Coins each. \n\n\nHow to make farming quicker\n\n\nAfter acquiring them, plant them in the ground and grow them with some water. Unfortunately, they'll grow in two lengthy hours. You can speed up the process by making a Miracle Growth Elixir. They're made at a crafting table with the following:\n\n\n\n10 Vitalys Crystals\n\n\n10 Rich Soils\n\n\n500 Dreamlight\n\n\n\nVitalys Crystals are gained from the cave within the waterfall of Sunlit Plateau. Mine the rocks inside there. Rich Soil can be grabbed by digging up the ground, planting vegetables/fruit, and then gathering the crops. \n\n\nOnce you have all of these materials, go to a crafting table and make the Miracle Growth Elixir. Plant the oats you want to grow and then bury them in the ground. Use the Miracle Growth Elixir, take out the water can, and then start watering the crops. They'll instantly grow. \n\n\nNow that you have the Oats, go to a cooking station in Chez Remy or your house. Place one serving of oats and one fruit, like raspberries, into the pot. You'll then have Scottish Porridge in your inventory.\n\nThe post How to make Scottish Porridge in Disney Dreamlight Valley appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The Lullaby assault rifle is certainly one of the better guns you can yield in Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl, and it's a reward locked exclusively for those who have purchased the Ultimate Edition.\n\n\nBut simply spending the extra dollars (or whatever currency that applies to you) isn't enough, for you'll have to obtain the gun by solving the mission. As in this case, there's a specific Journalist Stash that you'll need to find, which unlocks the gun for any use inside the game.\n\n\nLullaby Assault Rifle location in Stalker 2\n\n\nTo get this gun, you'll have to reach a location called Army Warehouses. This POI is situated in the Central Plant region, and there are plenty of things to loot over here. You'll find a locked room at this location, which can be unlocked with a code. Make sure to check out our guide to know more about how to get the loot.\n\n\nIf you have the Ultimate Edition (Deluxe Edition isn't enough), you will have an additional pop-up on your map when you reach the Army Warehouses location. Instead of having to settle with one set of rewards, you can actually double your yield.\n\n\nImage via Destructoid\n\n\nHow to extract the Lullaby Assault Rifle in Stalker 2\n\n\nOnce you've reached the spot, you'll notice a truck parked around the exterior wall. Jump on top of it to reach a metal overhang. From there, you can crawl to enter the building. This will lead you to the Lullaby assault rifle stash and the key that enables you to get the Army Warehouses code.\n\n\nTo get the code, you'll have to put in some extra effort, and you can read that in your guide as mentioned above. If you're a Deluxe Edition owner, you can get the Monolith AR416. This is another handy rifle to use, and it can be obtained quite easily by following the steps mentioned in this guide.\n\nThe post How to get the Lullaby Assault Rifle in Stalker 2 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Castle Master, the haunting conclusion to the Freescape engine saga, is now ready for public testing!\nPrepare yourself for a perilous adventure as you lower the drawbridge to enter the Castle Master’s domain. Released in 1990 by Incentive Software, Castle Master became popular for its technical innovation and challenging gameplay. The game inspired countless 3D adventure titles, and the Freescape engine itself marked a technological milestone, enabling groundbreaking object interaction and spatial puzzles.\nNotably, Castle Master was one of the first games to let you choose to play as either a prince or a princess, offering a different experience depending on your choice.\nYour mission: rescue your twin, imprisoned within the eerie depths of Castle Eternity by the evil Magister. This sprawling, foreboding castle is filled with traps, monsters, and puzzles blocking your path. Gather items, unlock doors, and solve complex riddles as you navigate the labyrinthine halls and confront the dark forces within.\nThis modern reimplementation showcases enhanced graphics using OpenGL, with initial support for the DOS and ZX Spectrum releases. If you’re eager to embark on this dark journey, a playable demo is available to test your tenacity.\nTo participate in the testing, ensure you have a daily development build. We encourage all players to submit feedback and bug reports through our issue tracker.\nWill you brave the creepy corridors of Castle Eternity and free your sibling, or will you fall victim to the Magister’s curse and join his army of enslaved spirits? The adventure awaits!\n>",

          "description": "After seven months of intense work, we are ready to announce support for a few games based on qdEngine, developed by K-D Labs.\nThe work is based on the original sources published now under GPL, although the work started a bit earlier than that. The engine supports 14 games, five of which we are announcing support for. Most of these games were released in Russian; however, there were Lithuanian, Czech, and Polish releases. The support is announced for:\nWait for it! Issue 3. Song for a Hare, (Russian: Ну, погоди! Выпуск 3. Песня для зайца, Lithuanian: Na, palauk!

День рождения морской крысы, Polish: Były Sobie Myszki Trzy: Urodzinowe Śledztwo)\nOther games do work; however, we haven’t playtested them. You may find more information on our Wiki. Also, we are looking for the Lithuanian version of Little Longnose and Polish releases of Little Mice games and Wait for it! game. If you happen to have a copy, please contact sev.\nWe continue the active development so that support for other games will follow shortly. The primary constraint is playtesting.\nTo run these games, you need the latest daily build of ScummVM. If you encounter any hiccups during your quests, please file them on our issue tracker.\n>",

          "description": "We are excited to announce that Rise of the Dragon  is now ready for public testing. This is the first of a small number of games built using the DGDS (Dynamix Game Development System) engine.\nThe Dynamix name may be familiar – bought by Sierra in 1990, the Dynamix brand continued and became well known for action and puzzle games like The Incredible Machine, A10 Tank Killer, and Red Baron.  They also made a few adventures using the custom DGDS engine.\nRise of the Dragon is set in Los Angeles in a dark version of the future, circa 2053.  You play as Blade Hunter, a private investigator and retired police officer.  After a designer drug kills the mayor's rebellious daughter, Chandra, Hunter is hired to find the people responsible for releasing the drug on the streets. What Blade ultimately finds is much more than he expected.  Rise of the Dragon combines classic point-and-click adventure style with platforming arcade sequences, giving a unique gameplay combination.\nYou’ll need the latest daily build of ScummVM and files from the DOS version of the game, which you can buy at GOG (check our wiki for the required data files).  Please file any issues you notice on our bug tracker.\n>",
