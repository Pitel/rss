That particular game isn't coming to Switch sadly (though we'll remain optimistic for whatever the consoles successor will bring), so unfortunately we won't be experiencing the likes of Ramon Salazar in glorious next-gen graphics on Nintendo's system. We'll keep dreaming though!\nOne fan on Twitter, however, has gone in the complete opposite direction by commencing work on a Resident Evil 4 \"DEmake\", effectively taking the characters and environments from the fourth mainline entry and bringing the visuals in line with Resident Evil 2. Complete with static camera angles and an animated loading screen, the resulting presentation is incredibly convincing!

On one hand, Yurukill fronts as a murder-mystery adventure similar to Danganronpa or – if you squint hard enough – Phoenix Wright. On the other, Yurukill also throws at you some shoot ‘em up segments that seem thematically unrelated. Finding clues and reading through line after line of dramatic dialogue before shooting down hordes of enemy ships to an electronic beat seems to go together about as well as pickles on ice cream, yet somehow developer IzanagiGames (along with shmup dev G.Rev) pulls off this bizarre mixture way better than we thought possible.\nYurukill begins with Sengoku Shunju waking up on a prison ferry on its way to Yurukill Land – an amusement park filled with murder-themed attractions. Joining him are five other prisoners, including a foul-mouthed biker and his straight-laced twin brother, a snobbish rich kid, a peppy teenage idol, and a bumbling detective. Prior to finding themselves on their way to Yurukill Land, all of them were convicted of some crime or other. Sengoku, for example, was sentenced to 999 years in prison for causing nearly two dozen deaths by burning down an entire apartment building.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "\"The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel...\".\nIt’s interesting to consider how the role-playing genre has grown over the years, changing expectations around what somebody can expect from one. These days, an RPG usually consists of a relatively big fantasy or sci-fi world, a deep narrative, and a combat system heavily dependent on various numerical values. Gamedec—a new release from Polish developer Anshar Studios—more or less hits those first two specifiers, but there’s no combat or stat points to speak of here. For some, this lack of focus on gameplay may come across as a drawback, but we’d encourage you to try it anyway. There’s a fascinating world to participate in here if you have the right mindset.\nGamedec places you in the role of the eponymous Gamedec—a ‘game detective’—who works various cases tracking down missing persons, solving murders, etc. These cases are all based on the work of Marcin Przybyłek, a Polish author who wrote a five-part collection of original short stories set in a technologically advanced universe. Each case has you jumping between Realium (the real world) and various digital games—like a cute take on Harvest Moon—using a special chair that sends a person’s mind into the game.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Unlike the bulk of actual Prime Day deals, the ones you’ll find listed here don’t even need an Amazon Prime account to access.\nPrevious Prime Days have driven competing retailers to knock down some of their own prices, and this year looks to be no different, so I’ve included some good sales from non-Amazon retailers as well. For the 12th and 13th we’ll also post a full anti-Prime Day deals guide (like last year's), so you can still make some savings even if you’re avoiding Amazon specifically.\nRead more",

          "description": "Steam Deck production might be ramping up again but it turns out more recent orders could be something of a lucky dip, SSD-wise. Valve have quietly updated their Steam Deck tech specs page with a note that the NVMe SSDs in “some” 256GB and 512GB models might now use the PCIe Gen 3.0 x2 interface, meaning the drive has half the usual bandwidth of the Gen 3.0 x 4 SSDs that previously featured as standard.\nAs first spotted by German site HardwareLuxx, there's no indication as to why Valve made this change, and it doesn’t look like anyone with an outstanding Steam Deck order will know which SSD bandwidth they’ll get in advance. However, Valve's added note explains that “In our testing, we did not see any impact to gaming performance between x2 and x4.”\nRead more",

This wasn’t a bad thing, mind. Far from it. I found Rise to be a substantially better-paced MonHunt entry compared to its predecessors, the series’ steep barrier to entry readjusted to a gentle incline that was more palatable for newcomers like me. Monster Hunter’s particular flavour of RPG design has always felt like trying to find a fork in a friend’s kitchen while they’re in another room. Nothing is where you expect it to be and there are a lot of things here you just don’t understand. Admittedly Rise wasn’t much better, stuffed as it was with endless text-based tutorials, but at the very least it pointed out the right drawer this time around. \r\n\n \nRead more",

Whenever it starts, I tend to drop whatever I'm doing - work, dishes, significant other - and I'll be out frolicking in the downpour before they've hit the floor.\nBecause I love rain so much, I hold games to an almost unfair standard when it comes to the simulation of precipitation. How in the world can a videogame come close to emulating that wonderful, transcendental feeling of being outside in the middle of a thunderstorm? The answer is, it can't. Games have to rely on other things, like textures, sounds, and clever little animations to really sell the idea of being out amongst the H₂s and the Os.\nThe time has come, fellow pluviophiles. It's time to grade the very best rain that PC gaming has to offer. Below you'll find our eight worthy contenders. Each has been chosen for their spectacular rendition of one of nature's greatest phenomena. Each one shall be marked according to my patented and cutting-edge WIPERS grading system for digital rain. So drop what you're doing. It's time to frolick. No umbrella required.\nRead more",

Before starting a game, it gives an impression of being a complex grand strategy that's something like a fantasy Total War with a D&D alignment system and a distinctly East Asian focus on characters and dialogue.\nIt's far simpler than that. There was a period of disappointment, even, when it seemed like there wasn't much to it at all. That's partly because it's easy to play it too passively, or get stuck in attritional stand offs, and partly because of the need for a bit too much repetition. But over time its subtler details become more apparent, and your choices start to feel more multifaceted.\nAnd yet, it remains at heart the same throughout. On your first ten turns you're doing the same actions as in your 200th, and its battles in particular are largely hands off. So maybe it's complicated, but simple to actually play? Hmm.\nRead more",

I have now played through a small bit of the game, a slightly extended version of the area I saw in the hands off preview, and my analysis is... largely the same.\nI know that's very boring, but it's also positive, isn't it? Oxenfree was good, and Oxenfree II looks to be doing those same things that made Oxenfree good. A 2D, side-on supernatural thriller with radios. Good thing remains good! In a world where sequels to beloved media seem to only get progressively worse, I'll happily take it (especially since this one is a Netflix-published project now). And although it's directly related to the first game, the characters and happenings in Oxenfree II are distinct enough that it's going to be accessible if you're new to the series. And even if you did play the first game, it's possible that Oxenfree II will be more thrilling and unsettling to you now, five years later.\nRead more",

The filing, made last year and published this past week, describes a head-mounted display with a rear housing, and the mechanisms by which that display could be adjusted. It's not thrilling stuff - but it is further confirmation that Valve continue to work on designs for VR hardware.\r\n\n \nRead more",

SpellForce the video game series isn’t that; it’s a trio of RPG-RTS hybrids which, by the time you read this, will have had a new entry announced in the form of SpellForce: Conquest Of Eo. It’s a fresh, turn-based take on the series which casts the player as a wizard attempting to further their mastery of magic.\r\n\n \nRead more",

But over the past several months the folks at the 3mdeb consulting firm have carried out a terrific feat: porting their \"Dasharo\" downstream of Coreboot to a modern and readily available Intel desktop motherboard.

          "description": "A nice place to visit, but you wouldn't wanna die there\nBethesda Softworks, in association with developer Arkane Studios, has dropped a fresh trailer for its upcoming co-op shooter Redfall, which remains currently in development for PC and Xbox Series X.\nThe video focuses on both the titular monster-ridden city, as well as the posse of protagonists bringing their superheroic ways to the blood-soaked streets — aiming to clean the city of vampires, zombies, and other unholy creatures of the undead. In the preview, we meet inventor Remi De La Rosa, hunter extraordinaire Devinder Crousley, the trigger-happy Jacob Boyer, and the telepath Layla Ellison, all of whom sound as if they were named by NXT development.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwY9IncC6XI&t\nBlending seamless single and multi-player options, Redfall will allow players to choose and customize their character as best fits the battle, making adjustments for loadouts, skills, and special abilities. By forming strong, synergized builds with your fellow teammates, the four heroes will offer a threat to the huge number of bad beasties that wait within the parks, buildings, restaurants, and tourist traps of this once quaint community.\nWith large open-world areas, a dazzling array of makeshift weaponry, and oodles of style and charisma, Redfall hopes to capture the co-op horror market on release, offering an alternate to some of the team-shooter titles currently available in the genre. While the development team was unfortunately forced to delay the title to allow for extra polish to the \"ambitious\" release, Redfall is now expected to launch in early 2023 on PC and Xbox Series X.\nThe post Redfall trailer introduces you to its vampire-filled city streets appeared first on Destructoid.",

He whistles...and...nope! The horse immediately turns around, and starts swimming away. Cold as ice.\nIt's a fine line, this sort of stuff, but Zelda: Breath of the Wild generally makes things easy to come back from. In other open world games the \"emergent\" gameplay can often lead to game-breaking bugs or frustration. And Breath of the Wild has some of that, to be sure!\nBut I encountered my fair share of good quirks like this, enough to even help carry multiple playthroughs. If my horse did this in-game, I'd have to put the controller down to have a good laugh. It's just perfect: the speed and cadence in which it peaces out.\nI know five years on, folks are a little tired of Breath of the Wild still being in the zeitgeist, but I know a lot of people still get a kick out of it, or even still play it! I salute you all.\n\nThe post I don’t blame this Zelda: Breath of the Wild horse for peacing out appeared first on Destructoid.",

For roughly $15 USD a year (or about $1.5 a month), you can join up.\nNintendo is calling the service \"Wide Care,\" and it's available on their official site directly. They describe it as \"a repair warranty service that can solve such problems. We guarantee a wide range of failures such as natural failures, failures due to getting wet, and damage due to dropping.\" Hilariously, one the incidents described on the page trying to get you to subscribe involves being worried that your kid will drop your Switch outside.\nIt seems to actually be \"wide' as advertised, and will cover most repairs, with the catch that you get six uses per year. Shipping is covered, and the Switch Lite is covered (though not separate Joy-Con or the dock if you just own a Switch Lite, which makes sense as the Lite doesn't come with either accessory). You can find all of the details on the main page, or below:\n\nThis is just the latest in a long line of Switch repair services to help Nintendo stave off current and future lawsuits dealing with the state of Joy-Con controllers. Remember that in the US at least, the company is still offering free Joy-Con repairs.\nThe post Whoa: Nintendo of Japan started a Switch repair subscription appeared first on Destructoid.",

A new story indicates Sega is digging into the Atlus catalog for potential live-action film and TV adaptations.\nSpeaking to IGN, Sega says it is currently exploring live-action film and TV projects with various studios and producers. Toru Nakahara—producer on the Sonic the Hedgehog movies—says Sega is exploring the idea, specifically pointing towards the Persona franchise.\n\"Atlus' worlds are filled with high drama, cutting-edge style and compelling characters,\" said Nakahara. \"Stories like those from the Persona franchise really resonate with our fans and we see an opportunity to expand the lore like no one has seen—or played—before.\n\"Together, Sega and Atlus, are working to bring these stories and worlds to life through new mediums and for new audiences,\" Nakahara says.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmG-k8SHkng\nSky's the limit\nSega didn't specify any production companies in particular to IGN. It's only interested in exploring potential projects with various studios and producers at the moment.\nIt's not like Persona hasn't been adapted before, though mostly through animated series and OVAs. But making it with human actors could get a little weird.\nWhile The Witcher and other series have moved into the corporeal realm with solid results, anime-styled adaptations haven't always fared so well. Look at Netflix's Death Note if you need an example.\nStill, video game adaptations continue to be all the rage. Sega has done pretty well with the live-action Sonic movies so far, so there's some earned lee-way in experimenting a bit. Just uh, please don't make a live-action Teddy.

The first title in the hyper-kinetic series will be available to purchase on Xbox One and Xbox Series X today, with its two sequels scheduled to roll out over the summer.\nAlready available on PlayStation, PC, and Nintendo platforms, Azure Striker Gunvolt is a fast-paced and highly electrifying platform adventure that found fame as a Nintendo 3DS release way back in 2014. It tells a tale of a highly-skilled, superpowered mercenary, (the titular Gunvolt), who embarks on a mission to eliminate a squad of equally skilled special agents, guided by their mysterious musical muse, Lumen.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xp9wXNRP6A\nOf course, this simple premise merely sets the stage for a dramatic tale of love, loss, revenge, and redemption — set alongside action-packed retro-infused gameplay. This popular release would be followed up by Azure Striker Gunvolt 2 in 2016, which continued the story while offering improved gameplay and other dynamic features. A second sequel, Azure Striker Gunvolt 3, is in its final production stages, with a release date scheduled for just a few weeks from now.\nAzure Striker Gunvolt is available now on Xbox platforms, Azure Striker Gunvolt 2 will launch on July 14, while Azure Striker Gunvolt 3 will arrive on August 2, five days after its 28 July Switch date.

Even back in our first look at the project, it was a really cool blend of classic ideas and modern design, like a love letter to the likes of Chrono Trigger and Super Mario RPG.\nFor the team's health and for the game's benefit, a little extra wait is a good thing. Considering how well The Messenger came together, I've got high hopes for Sea of Stars.\nIt's not like 2022 is hurting for RPGs either. Just in July, two big games are launching in Xenoblade Chronicles 3 and the HD-2D remake of Live A Live. Plus, the newly announced Crisis Core remaster is also aiming for this winter.

It's crazy that we've gotten to the point where the eShop is so packed (well, that's one word for it) that 30ish games on top of the marquee releases is \"low,\" but typically, there's at least 40 going up per week.\nNintendo Download: Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak Edition\nAlmost My Floor\nBeasties \nBlack Wolf\nCAN ANDROIDS SURVIVE\nCasual Gaming Bundle\nComic Coloring Book Complete Edition: COLORS\nDARK MINUTE: Kira’s Adventure\nDino Tales\nFamily Bundle\nFillit\nGamedec\nGliding Square\nGround Divers!\nGum+\nHourglass\nINSTANT SPORTS All-Stars \nJETBOY\nMy Universe – Green Adventure: Farmer’s Friends\nNakana Bundle #1 (Soul Searching + A Night at the Races + Infini)\nNakana Bundle #2 (Mythic Ocean + Journey of the Broken Circle + Cosmic Top Secret)\nNakana Bundle #3 (EQQO + Lydia + Stilstand)\nNincat\nParasite Pack \nQuintus and the Absent Truth \nRainbow Laser Disco Dungeon\nRed White Yellow Cruising\nSalaryman Shi\nSine\nSquish\nTaco Tom 2\nTimber Story\nIf you missed last week’s edition, here it is.

          "description": "Barlog responds to exhausting demands for info\nCory Barlog, producer of the upcoming God of War Ragnarok, has once again asked fans for patience in their wait for news of a release date. Barlog made the comments in response to rabid speculation and demands for updates on the highly anticipated sequel.\n\"Dear all, if it were up to me I would share all the information when I know about it,\" said Barlog on his official Twitter. \"But it is not up to me. so please, be patient. I promise things will be shared at the earliest possible moment they can be. We make games for you. We get to make games because of you.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE-4GvjKcfs\nIt's a typically reserved response from Barlog, who has previously proven themselves a master at remaining calm and pragmatic in the face of endless requests and demands. It had previously been suggested that Sony would reveal the launch date during this month's State of Play presentation. It was then rumored that the date would be revealed today, June 30. Given Barlog's comments, however, we are probably still a little time away from receiving news on God of War Ragnarok's elusive release date.\nGod of War Ragnarok, currently in development at Sony Santa Monica, is the follow-up to the award-winning and critically acclaimed 2018 release God of War. The new sequel will once again see aging warrior Kratos — accompanied by his son Atreus — as they venture through the nine realms on a quest to prevent the arrival of Ragnarok, a cataclysmic event that will bring destruction to the Norse gods and much of civilization.\nGod of War Ragnarok is currently in development for PlayStation platforms.\nThe post God of War Ragnarok producer asks for patience in release date news appeared first on Destructoid.",

As a reminder, a transmog is essentially a cosmetic item that you can \"replace\" a piece of gear with aesthetically, but keep all of the original stats of said gear. You'll need to go to a transmog NPC to actually make use of the Jewel of the Firelord, and it'll just appear on your account.\nHere are all of the games with bonuses in July:\nBrawlhalla\nLost Ark\nNBA 2K22\nNew World\nPokémon GO\nThe Elder Scrolls Online \nWorld of Warcraft\nRemember, on July 12-13, you'll be able to pick up 30 games, including Mass Effect: Legendary Edition.

While The Delicious Last Course adds a playable third character (Chalice) into the mix on top of additional equipment, the main draw is an extra DLC island with more bosses to fight. The good news: it's really easy to unlock.\n\nYou just need to finish the first Mausoleum level\nSince a lot of folks are likely starting up a new fresh save file for the DLC (or are buying the game for the first time), I figured it was worth pointing out how to get to the new island.\nIn short: to access the DLC island in Cuphead, all you need to do is finish the first Mausoleum level. The shortest path involves beating the initial \"Run & Gun\" (platforming) stage, Forest Follies. It's denoted by a small diamond icon on the ground. After completion (you don't need to get all the coins), a bridge will pop up to the east.\nHead over it, then south, to get to the Mausoleum. This one is super easy to complete: you just need to parry (press the jump button while in the air with Cuphead or Mugman) the spirits before they reach the middle of the arena. They move slowly and there aren't that many to defeat.\n\nAfter that, a ferry NPC appears that brings you to the new Cuphead DLC island\nAfter completion the Mausoleum will crumble, denoting that it was conquered. An NPC will appear holding an oar, and their boat will take you to \"Island IV,\" which is the location of the DLC.\nIf you load into an existing save file, the NPC should be available to take you to the DLC without an extra step.\nThe post Here’s how to find the Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course DLC island appeared first on Destructoid.",

Danganronpa S: Ultimate Summer Camp is officially headed to PS4, PC, and mobile platforms, and will be with us as soon as next month.\nOriginally released on Nintendo Switch in late 2021, Danganronpa S: Ultimate Summer Camp is an expanded and revamped version of the \"Ultimate Talent Development Plan\" board game, as featured in Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony. Starring a huge cast of characters pulled from across Kazutaka Kodaka's wild whodunnit franchise, Danganronpa S sees our guys and girls hanging out, fighting monsters, and gathering cool new gear during a vacation on the mysterious \"Jabberwock Island.\"\nhttps://youtu.be/NeGtGEztbNQ\nWhile Danganronpa S boasts the sly sense of humor, cheesecake fanservice, and striking visual aesthetic of its contemporaries, it was chastised for a heavy reliance on grinding, as well as its love affair with tiring gacha and microtransaction mechanics. While our own Eric Van Allen found a lot of fun in seeing all of these famous faces cross over, he also noted that the gameplay required to enable said interactions was repetitive and tedious.\nIn the eyes of many Danganronpa fans, Ultimate Summer Camp is a wonderful idea on paper, packed out with dream meetings for the series' long-time fans, but the execution is weak. No pun intended\nDanganronpa S: Ultimate Summer Camp launches on PS4, PC, and iOS and Android platforms July 21.

A new report reveals the company is cancelling several projects and cutting jobs.\nBloomberg reports that four Niantic projects have been canceled, including its Transformers game and a collaboration with Sleep No More company Punchdrunk. It's also reportedly set to cut \"about 85 to 90\" jobs.\nNiantic hit huge success with Pokemon Go, the augmented reality game that turned into a summer craze for the ages. Pokemon Go still garners a massive following nearly six years later. Sensor Tower reports that Pokemon Go has now surpassed $6 billion in global lifetime spending, across the App Store and Google Play Store.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sj2iQyBTQs\nThe success hasn't transferred over to every subsequent project, though. Niantic shuttered Harry Potter: Wizards Unite in January, and while Pikmin Bloom is pretty neat, it's also seemingly struggled to bottle the PokeGo lightning.\nWalking around the block\nIn an email to staff seen by Bloomberg, Niantic CEO John Hanke reportedly wrote the company was \"facing a time of economic turmoil\" and needs to further streamline its operations, to weather any \"economic storms\" ahead.\n\"We recently decided to stop production on some projects and reduce our workforce by about 8% to focus on our key priorities,\" a spokesperson told Bloomberg. \"We are grateful for the contributions of those leaving Niantic and we are supporting them through this difficult transition.\"\nThe company did recently reveal a new mobile game, called NBA All-World. It's a sports game intended to blend the real world with one-on-one basketball, as well as collecting and fashion. It also has Peridot, another real-world game featuring pet-like creatures, in development. We'll see if these projects can help bring Niantic further out of the storm.\nThe post Pokemon Go creator Niantic cancels several projects and cuts staff appeared first on Destructoid.",

Although it technically debuted during the Nintendo Direct Mini presentation this week, Super Bomberman R 2 is actually arriving on PC, PS4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X devices in 2023.\nThe big additions for the Super Bomberman R sequel Konami is revealing so far include:\nA \"castle\" battle mode where one person can challenge 15 other players with traps and support characters\nA creation mode, which Konami says is \"essentially a level editor,\" that also has a share feature for online play\nIn terms of what's coming back, the story mode is returning (with exploration sequences, base building, defense missions, and boss battles), as well as the 64-person battle royale mode, grand prix, and standard battle.\nFor me, the castle mode sounds the most intruiging. It's the kind of thing you'd make up as a kid playing Bomberman for the first time, but never actually get to play. You can watch it in action below, or at this timestamp in the new trailer (starting roughly 0:45 seconds in).\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAugdDnuy2M\nThe post Super Bomberman R 2 has potential to right the wrongs of its predecessor appeared first on Destructoid.",

Camp Canyonwood is coming to Steam Early Access on August 4, and it'll task us with keeping campers in line, expanding the campground, and exploring mysteries in a Don't Starve-ish world. I'm intrigued.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugm_zY6ZQtg\nThe best part of the trailer is arguably the end, where it's confirmed that ghosts, UFOs, and other oddities are in the mix.

Plus, Nintendo has since introduced SNES, Nintendo 64, and even Sega Genesis games, giving players a chance to play some fan-favorite classics and some deep cuts, too. It’s hard to predict when new games might arrive as the company has maintained a somewhat inconsistent cadence in doing so, but that’s okay because this list is all you need. \nAs Nintendo adds new titles, we’ll be sure to update this list to include them.

          "description": "Sea of Stars, the promising-looking retro RPG from the team behind The Messenger, is the latest title to get pushed out of 2022. \nDeveloper Sabotage posted a message on Twitter stating it simply wants to polish up the adventure as much as possible without crunching its staff.\nWhile the delay is a bummer, we appreciate the team’s respect for the employee’s work/life balance and strive for quality. The idea of getting a demo this year is certainly enticing too, as Sea of Stars has looked phenomenal every time it’s made an appearance. \nThe game was first revealed in 2020 after a successful Kickstarter campaign and evokes JRPGs like Chrono Trigger, Illusion of Gaia, and Breath of Fire. It even features music contributions by Chrono Trigger composer Yasunori Mitsuda. Despite being a role-playing title, it serves as a prequel to 2018’s The Messenger, a Ninja Gaiden-inspired action game that was well-recieved (here’s our review). Sea of Stars centers on two heroes who wield the power of the moon and the sun to battle an evil alchemist. You can watch the original reveal trailer below.",

          "description": "Every so often, a game development studio comes up with an idea so good other developers insert it into their games. In Pow Wow Entertainment's newly announced racer, Stuntfest: World Tour, I'm hoping the unique ejector-seat functionality is so jaw-droppingly incredible that it becomes the next craze. In the game's first trailer, we see drivers rocketing out of their cars to bounce off pads or ignite a jetpack's thrusters.\nStuntfest: World Tour is in development for PC with publishing duties handled by THQ Nordic sometime in 2022. We don't have many details yet, but a press release states that the player can assume the identity of a \"punker granny\" or a \"famous streamer\" with the hope of winning elimination-style stunt shows featuring 18 drivers. The competitions range from destruction derbies to glider racers. When the player hits the ejector button and their driver launches hundreds of meters into the air, they can be freely controlled and gadgets can be used to gain an edge. When descending, the next car you see can be yours to drive. Progress in the world tour rewards you with vehicle upgrades.\nStuntfest: World Tour has a hell of a hook, but it's difficult to figure out how these races will unfold. I can't wait to get my hands on this game to see if this unique gimmick (and the high levels of destruction) add up to something special.",

Developer Full Circle and publisher Electronic Arts are looking for players who want to playtest the game and provide feedback on its development. You can sign up for this \"insider\" program here. As EA notes, you cannot share your videos or screenshots from your play sessions.\nIf you are curious what Skate currently looks like or what you can expect from the gameplay, EA has released a trailer with the appropriate title \"Still working on it.\" The first few clips focus on bails, which must have been captured early in development given how rough the animations are. As the trailer moves on, the animations smooth out and the series' skating realism returns and is on display in a handful of awesome sequences. Full Circle also looks to be upping the scale of the challenges through some wild clips featuring impossible grind opportunities and huge ramps. Most of these clips are lack any kind of texturing or lighting and truly give us a look at how games are made.\nRegardless of where it is at in development, this trailer gives a fun look at a series that never should have left us.

Check out the short trailer below; it's as deliciously chaotic as you'd expect. \nThere was once a group of warriors who attempted to defeat the darkness.\n@FinalFantasy Origin's first expansion Trials of the Dragon King launches July 20th. pic.twitter.com/YvGEwGh1ux\nJune 30, 2022\nIn Stranger of Paradise fashion, it's hard to parse through what's happening in the footage, but we see Jack and co. cleaving their way through armored adversaries ranging from shield-holding knights to winged beasts with dazzling blades of their own. In one scene, a kingly figure sits upon a throne – is it safe to assume this is the Dragon King? – and says, \"You will die here, and I will live forever.\" We're sure Jack will make him eat his words. \nStranger of Paradise is as bizarre as Final Fantasy gets. Andrew Reiner gave the game a 7 out of 10 and concluded his review by saying, \"Stranger of Paradise is the strangest Final Fantasy game yet, bounding wildly between awful and fantastic. If you can tolerate Jack (and that's a big ask), the excellently crafted combat is worth a look. You may be coming to this game for the story and Final Fantasy experience, but it's all about combat and little else.\"\nStranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin's first DLC expansion, Trials of the Dragon King, drops on July 20 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.",

The leader of the Junkers is more of an offensive tank than some of her other colleagues within the category. She comes strapped with a shotgun that maybe doesn't have the power of Roadhog's but has plenty of damage to dismantle the opposing team. She also comes equipped with a handy throwing knife that can cause quite the commotion. If players land a hit with an electrified weapon, enemy health drops over time. If she misses, the knife can still help as you can call it back, similar to the Leviathan Axe from God of War (2018), and actually pull enemies closer. Pair those abilities with her deadly charge up and a devastating ultimate attack, and she has a chance to really make some waves.\nOn top of a deep dive into Junker Queen and her moveset, we're also showing off the Push game type and Colleseo, a brand new map for Overwatch players to explore and dominate in.

In fact, the series is going bigger. Much bigger!\n\n\nThe first trailer for Ultra Kaiju Monster Rancher asks a crucial question, \"How would you like to raise your very own Ultra Kaiju?\" To which I responded, \"Yes, please. I'd very much like that. Give it to me now.\" Foregoing the dull, average-sized creatures you used to raise in Monster Rancher, Ultra Kaiju Monster Rancher lets you take care of some colossal sweet boys. You'll raise the likes of Zettan, Gomora, and Alien Baltan – all licensed Kaiju from the Ultraman franchise. Many other existing Kaiju appear in the game, and you'll take them to help townsfolk in ways only a giant monster could. You can also participate in massive monster battles or watch the colossal beings waddle like big clumsy babies. As a fun bonus, the Kaiju can be bred, making wild combinations of their attributes appear in their children. It all seems like a lot of goofy fun.\nWe're not sure if Ultra Kaiju Monster Rancher is coming to North America, but it's slated to hit Japan and Southeast Asia this year. At the very least, a version will be translated into English for those looking to import.",

In addition to dropping not one, not two, but three videos fleshing out the game's narrative, characters, and combat, we now know the JRPG launches in October. \nThe Divine Force arrives on October 27, exactly one year after it was first announced. The first trailer showcases the plot with a montage of out-of-context story clips that sets the tone for what's to come in the sci-fi action RPG. \n\n\nThe second video provides a more thorough walkthrough of Star Ocean's characters and combat. Players assume the role of one of two protagonists: Raymond Lawrence, a hot-headed merchant ship captain searching for his lost crew, and Laeticia Aucerius, a princess fighting to save her kingdom from destruction. The story unfolds differently depending on your chosen hero, and a ragtag party of allies accompanies each. The action-focused combat utilizes four party members players can swap between on the fly. You can battle in real-time or pause the action using Stop Mode to allow time to change tactics.  \n\n\nLastly, you watch the entire 8-minute opening cinematic for Raymond's campaign to see how the adventure kicks off for the young captain. \n\n\nTri-Ace promises to share more information in a future Mission Report video. Star Ocean The Divine Force will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.",

          "description": "Yesterday, Spellbreak developer Proletariat released a blog post detailing the future of its spell-based battle royale that launched years ago. In it, the studio revealed that the servers for Spellbreak will shut down in early 2023, effectively ending the run of this battle royale. \nThis shutdown likely had to do with the game’s low player count. Still, there might be more to it than that: Blizzard Entertainment, the studio behind franchises like Overwatch and Warcraft, is acquiring Proletariat and using its force of roughly 100 employees to staff up its World of Warcraft team, according to a new report from GamesBeat. \n“We are putting players at the forefront of everything we do, and we are working hard to both meet and exceed their expectations,” Blizzard president Mike Ybarra told the publication in a statement. “A big part of caring for our teams is making sure we have the resources to produce experiences our communities will love while giving our teams space to explore even more creative opportunities within their projects. Proletariat is a perfect fit for supporting Blizzard’s mission in bringing high-quality content to our players more often.” \nThis news comes just months before the launch of the newest World of Warcraft expansion, Dragonflight, which you can read more about here. As noted by GamesBeat, this acquisition is one of the largest in recent memory for Blizzard. This purchase means that the Proletariat team will be under the Microsoft-Xbox umbrella soon following the completion of Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard.\nAccording to the GamesBeat report, the purpose of this acquisition is to beef up World of Warcraft staff numbers so “that it can hit quality and timing goals for expansions.” Neither of the involved parties has publicly released a price for this transaction.\n[Source: GamesBeat]",

          "description": "You’ve probably heard of or played Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, the character-collecting adventure set in a galaxy far, far away. The mobile game launched in 2015 and, in the years that followed, amassed a substantial fanbase that continues to get support from sizeable roster updates. The creators behind Galaxy of Heroes recently formed Azra Games. And the studios’ debut title will appropriately be a collectible and combat RPG called Legions & Legends. \nAzra Games CEO and co-founder Mark Otero excitedly spoke about the announcement of the new game:\n“This will be my ninth collectible and combat RPG, one that builds upon and perfects the genre I’ve spent my entire career developing. I truly believe that we’ve cracked the code for a captivating gameplay experience built around the joys of collecting toys and taking them to battle against each other, just as we used to do when we were kids. At Azra, we’re looking to bring back that excitement of the toy box and playing with friends – remastered for a new generation of players.”\nAzra Games is a blockchain games company. Legions & Legends launches this summer (an exact date wasn’t specified) with the release of the “Genesis Collection” NFTs which generate in-game resources through Ethereum. But what exactly is Legions & Legends? A press release/blog post penned by Otero gives us a brief look into the Legions & Legends’ “uncharted galaxy where magic and technology collide.” \nCivilizations unknown to humankind are at war, and players will be at the forefront of the bloody conflict to claim the galaxy. Three character types can be deployed on the battlefield – Legionnaires, best used in large numbers, Commanders, known for special attacks/buffs, and Behemoths, slow and tanky creatures with devastating power. The aforementioned NFT collection introduces Genesis Explorers, which players can send on Exploration Missions for craftable parts. \nAs Otero put it, “Your journey deep into the Corvus Galaxy awaits.”",

Crystal Dynamics released a pair of videos showcasing her thunder-based abilities, giving fans a look at how she compares to her original male counterpart.\nJane arrives as a free character in all versions of Marvel’s Avengers. The narrative explains that Jane was torn from an alternate reality in which she is the one and only Thor. Odinson renounced Mjolnir following A-Day, and though Jane developed cancer, her transformation into the Goddess of Thunder halted the disease as she battled to protect Inhumans from persecution. One day, a Tachyon Strom caused by AIM opened a portal that dropped Jane into the game’s universe. She joins up with the Avengers to uncover the cause of the rifts and figure out how to return home. \nThe Mighty Thor wields Mjolnir with more precision than Odinson and sports new abilities that highlight her increased finesse. You can watch the War Table video below for a complete breakdown of her skills or watch the video below for a non-commentary gameplay demonstration.\n\n\n\n\nJane’s addition brings the game’s total roster of heroes to 10 on most platforms and 11 on PlayStation, thanks to Spider-Man’s exclusivity.

But the cycle is interrupted due to an abnormal event that creates a “season of death” called the Quietus, which causes crops to wither and threatens all life.\nHarvestella’s gameplay splits time between action-focused dungeon crawling and laid-back farm management. Players globetrot to areas representing the four seasons to battle monsters and explore dungeons. You can even hop in a submarine to traverse the oceans. Combat involves executing team maneuvers with party members, and each character can be outfitted with different jobs that grant unique characteristics, skills, and combat styles. \n\n\nWhen you’re not fighting for the world’s survival, you’ll return to your village to tend to your farm. Raising crops and livestock lets you harvest ingredients for crafting. When the work is done, socializing with townsfolk is another key diversion. Along the way, you’ll meet a cast of characters such as a time traveler from the future, and completing tasks for them grants rewards and improves your bonds with them. \nHarvestella looks intriguing and we can’t wait to see more of it. It’s also not terribly far away, launching November 4 for Switch and PC via Steam.",

Apparently, he's unleashing his full potential and hacking advanced superhero bases to level up his vigilanteism.\n\n\nIn a new character trailer, Robin shows off how he disposes of Gotham's thugs. His standard melee combat is centered around quick attacks and the use of his quarterstaff for leverage and mid-range beatdowns. Robin also has a stealthy element, enabling active camouflage to mask his presence and sneak up on unsuspecting suspects. The most surprising reveal in the trailer is that the Boy Wonder has tapped into the Justice League satellite to enable short-range teleportation to zip around Gotham to get the drop on enemies or make impossible leaps a reality. He's also using holograms to deploy decoys to deceive dummies in combat.\nGotham Knights is looking great after the last couple of trailers, and I'm looking forward to seeing this team take on the Court of Owls when it releases on October 25.",

During today's Nintendo Direct Mini, we received an update on the exciting, beautiful HD2D title that remakes the 1994 Super Famicom RPG that never came to Western markets. However, the big news from the presentation is that if you want to see what the buzz is all about, you can get a taste starting today.\nThe game puts you in the roles of multiple stories and multiple protagonists across different eras. The demo that hits the eShop today allows you to play three chapters from three different eras to get an idea of what to expect. Not only that but the save data transfers to the full game if you decide to buy it; it's always nice to know your time in a demo is productive when it comes to the final release.\nLive A Live comes to Switch on July 22.",

The result was a turn-based tactical title starring the Mushroom Kingdom's finest and the most unpredictable characters in Ubisoft's stable. Announced during Nintendo's E3 2021 Direct, Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope promises to carry forward the legacy of that fan-favorite title, but it's been a while since we've heard anything about that game.

This throwback to the 1999 PlayStation 1 title features revamped graphics and more, and is scheduled to release this August.\n\n\nPac-Man World puts you in the shoes of Pac-Man as he platforms through six worlds on Ghost Island to rescue his friends. Each world consists of five levels, with each world's final level featuring a boss battle. In the game, Pac-Man can use a variety of skills, including the ability to Rev Roll, Butt Bounce, and turn into Giant Pac-Man. When the original title was first released on PS1, Game Informer liked the title, scoring it an 8 out of 10 in 1999.\nThis is the second remake the original 1999 title has received, the first of which was in 2004 for the Game Boy Advance. The game also appeared on PlayStation Network beginning in 2013 under the PSOne Classics branding. However, the original PS1 version is not among the classic titles currently included in the PlayStation Plus Premium tier's classic catalog.\nPac-Man World: Re-Pac launches on August 26 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.",

In addition to announcing the game, we also got our first look at a promising new way to play called Castle Mode and a release window.\n\n\nIn the asymmetric multiplayer Castle Mode, a team of 15 players must blast their way to treasure chests scattered across the battlefield. Meanwhile, a solo player tries their best to hold them off. On top of what sounds like a wild mess of action, players can create and share their own battle stages for the mode, adding a ton to the replayability potential of this new form of play.\nWhen the first Super Bomberman R launched in 2017, I heavily criticized it for poor network performance, frustrating level design, and an overall lack of content. However, in the years since, the developers have improved the title through various updates and expanded the Switch-exclusive game to also appear on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. Hopefully, the development team learned from its mistakes with Super Bomberman R 2 and delivers a stronger product at launch. The aforementioned Castle Mode looks like a good time, so I'm hopeful. Super Bomberman R 2 arrives in 2023. It will be available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles as well as Switch and PC.",

Today, the team released another video spanning almost five minutes that highlights some of the well-worn and lesser-known locales of London that players can visit when the mod is released. \nAnd speaking of release, today’s trailer revealed that Fallout: London will be released in 2023, as reported by IGN. The release window comes after a stunning four minutes of in-game footage. Had I not known Fallout: London was a mod, I probably would have assumed it was a brand-new chapter in the franchise – that’s how good this looks! Check it out for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see in the trailer, players can expect to see Tower Bridge, Big Ben, and more. Plus, the trailer hints that players won’t win every battle with bullets – they might be going medieval in some quests, donning a knight’s armor and taking down enemies with a sword. Everything about this trailer is exciting. Fortunately, Fallout: London is releasing sometime next year. \nHere’s some more information about the mod straight from the team: \nFor more, check out the Fallout: London reveal trailer from last year and then read Game Informer’s Fallout 4 review.\n[Source: IGN]\nAre you excited about Fallout: London?

          "description": "The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker is a beloved game in the long-running Zelda series, but when it was first revealed, the reception was mixed. Some were completely on board, ready for this new take on the franchise, while others weren’t too happy about the visual style of the game. The latter party apparently included Legend of Zelda creator Shigeru Miyamoto. \nAccording to a translation of an old issue of Nintendo Dream Magazine by DidYouKnowGaming, Wind Waker director Eiji Aonuma said Miyamoto “literally cringed” when he first saw the game’s visual style, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. \n\n\n“If I had gone and talked to him from the very beginning, I think he would’ve said ‘How is that Zelda?'.\" Aonuma said in the magazine. “Miyamoto had trouble letting go of the realistic Link art style until the very end.\n“At some point, he had to give a presentation against his will. That’s when he said something to me like, ‘You know, it’s not too late to change course and make a realistic Zelda.'” \nMiyamoto is a legend, obviously, but it might’ve been a good thing that Aonuma trusted he and his team’s instinct and continued forward with Wind Waker’s art style – the game’s all the more memorable for it. \nFor more about Miyamoto, read how he wants to make the world a better place and then check out this story about how the latest Zelda, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2 (or whatever its sequel ends up being titled) has been delayed out of 2022 and into spring of 2023.  \n[Source: Video Games Chronicle]\nWhat are your thoughts on Wind Waker?

It’s a brutal show, with hilarious satire and multiple wild characters, but it seemingly didn’t hold the interest of Metal Gear Solid and Death Stranding director Hideo Kojima. \nThat’s because he quit after watching three episodes of Season 1, but the reason might have to do with more than just interest in the series. In a new series of tweets first spotted by Video Games Chronicle, Kojima has revealed that at one point in the past (likely 2019, which is when the first season of The Boys aired), he was making something similar in concept to The Boys. In fact, he put it on hold because of its similarity. \nThe Boys, which I quit after 3 episodes of Season 1. I thought I’d watch the rest of th…",

Our solar system’s largest planet may play host to a seemingly eternal storm, but something far fiercer is brewing on Callisto. It’s here that the creator of the Dead Space series, Glen Schofield, stages perhaps his most horrifying project yet.\nSet 300 years in the future, The Callisto Protocol unmistakably carries Schofield’s creative DNA, but through innovative technology, an uncompromised vision, and lessons learned from decades of development experience, Striking Distance Studios feels it has something more than a spiritual successor on its hands. The Callisto Protocol challenges players to face their fears as they descend into the depths of a lunar prison overrun by monstrous, infected humans and uncover what happened to one of our great hopes for life beyond Earth. We witnessed never-before-seen gameplay and spent hours picking the brains of Striking Distance Studios’ veteran developers to learn how this team is creating one of the scariest, most intense games of 2022.\nIn 2019, Schofield took a trip out to the desert to get away from the hustle and bustle of the game industry. Just months prior, he had left Activision, a publisher with whom he had worked for nearly a decade. While there, he helped lead a studio he cofounded, Sledgehammer Games, as it worked on three mainline Call of Duty titles: Modern Warfare 3, Advanced Warfare, and WWII. Schofield eventually transitioned to an executive role within Activision before leaving the company less than a year later. He decided to take some time off and plot his next move.\nRead more...",

          "description": "coverage here.\n\nIn a recent Reddit AMA, the Overwatch 2 team from Blizzard Entertainment took questions from the community regarding the state of the franchise and the upcoming pseudo-sequel to its popular hero shooter. In one answer, the folks from Blizz confirm an interesting detail about OW2 when it hits Early Access in the first week of October: it’ll replace the original Overwatch entirely.\nWhen OW2 launches on Oct 4th it will be a replacement for the current Live Service.\n\nRather than being a separate app on your console of choice or the Blizzard launcher, Overwatch 2 won’t be built up bit by bit on its own but will take the place of the original game and build off of that instead.\nWhile Overwatch 1 and 2 have always been planned to be tied together into a single client and overall roadmap, this is the first time Blizzard has announced publically that Overwatch 1 will cease to exist entirely when the sequel launches. Get your 6v6 games in now because they won’t be playable as of the OW2 Early Access launch.\nAlso of note from this quote is the timeframe of PvE content coming to OW2. Its initial Early Access content this year will provide a revamp to the PvP experience with new heroes, maps, modes, etc., but the long-touted narrative content for the sequel will be coming sometime in 2023 instead of with the rest of the package.\nOverwatch 2 will be free-to-play starting on October 4 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.",
