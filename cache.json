It’s a hack ‘n’ slash, an action platformer, an RPG, a monster catcher, and a deckbuilder, all rolled into one. If that sounds like too many ideas to cram into one game… well, it totally is, though Spirit Mancer still comes across as a modestly enjoyable and interesting game.\nSpirit Mancer follows the story of two military-trained demon hunters, Sebastian and Mary, who are suddenly transported away from the human world to Inferno, where a wicked demon queen has stolen away their friends. Armed with the titular Spirit Mancer, which gives them limited control over demons, the two set out to free their friends, defeat the queen, and save the world.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Both (the best Final Fantasy game) Final Fantasy 8’s Squall and The Witcher 3’s Geralt simply cannot get enough of leaving their friends and the entire world in mortal peril while they sneak in a quick round of cards, and I love them for it. Way back when the Wild Hunt released, there was a special edition kicking about that gave you a few decks for Gwent - the fleshed-out, playable card distraction that ended up being responsible for some of the game’s best moments. I pined for those decks, but I never acquired them. Now, Hatchette Board Games is putting out a full physical edition of Gwent next year.\nThe set contains \"over 400 cards and a playmat\" for £44/$39.99. I’m still recovering from various Fantasy Flight LCGs, so my value sense for this stuff might be a bit skewed, but that strikes me as incredibly reasonable. A good Gwent deck consists of only about 25 cards. They’re not bad cards, either! I’ve got a real pet hate for tabletop versions of videogames that just use in-engine screenshots for the cards, but these ones look to have the proper artwork from the game on them:\nRead more",

The Hitlerites and blackshirts of Indiana Jones And The Great Circle sneeze and cough as they patrol the dig sites of Gizeh, or the marble corridors of the Vatican. Although this is the Machine Games' clever way of letting you know where your enemies are at all times, it is also mildly funny, as if all the Nazis have been secretly kissing each other, spreading the same rhinovirus from Italy to Egypt to Nepal and beyond. More than that, it's a stubborn reminder that, despite the many hours of perfectly motion-captured cinematics that accompany all this, you are still playing a video game. A snotty tissue that separates the Indy of taut two-hour cinema and the Indy of a sweeping first-person punch 'em up that will take days to complete. All this is to say, you will notice the difference. But that might not matter; they're both still Indiana Jones. \r\n\n \nRead more",

At best. I’d successfully lured some bandits into the deadly lair of a bucket-tossing Poltergeist, but several attempts at more actively siccing mutated pigs on the Zone’s human baddies had all failed, even when I’d seemed to actually tame one.\nNow, my only friend lay dead at my feet, and I’m in dire need of some new beasts to master. And some cash. It turns out that a fighting style that involves letting shopping trolley-sized swine creatures chew on my heels is bad for the ol’ HP, and having recently blown my savings on half a sausage, I’m forced to shift focus from my current debt collection mission towards a means to fill my own coffers.\nRead more",

Still, it’s not often we see psychological horror combined with ultraviolence, and anything that gives off even a whiff of Condemned: Criminal Origins has my attention.\nTotal Chaos started life as a popular Doom 2 mod, and while I dare the say the limitations of that game sell the atmosphere a little better than this much sleeker update, I certainly trust Trigger Happy enough to make the most of the new engine. The game is set in New Oasis, a “once bustling haven for coal miners” that is now most definitely not bustling, nor haven-like.\nRead more",

History actually remembers Computer Artworks’s 2002 shooty horror game for how incredibly ambitious and conceptually inventive its proto-sus social squad system was. In homage to the body-snatching alien paranoia of Carpenter’s 1982 horror classic, The Thing tasks you with not just assembling and directing a squad, but keeping them from breaking down or turning on you - in fear you might be hosting the titular molecular stowaway.\nRead more",

          "description": "One of my favourite anime shows is Sakura Quest. It's the story of an unemployed lady from Tokyo who accidentally gets herself appointed \"Queen\" of a struggling backwater village by the regional tourist board. From that case of mistaken identity proceeds 25 whole-ass episodes of Machiavellian haggling with crusty bigwigs over things like organising a concert. It's playfully dull, heartily mundane entertainment. No supernatural flourishes here - just the magic of paperwork and the thrill of bureaucracy.\r\n\n\r\nI'm reminded of Sakura Quest by Danchi Days, a forthcoming cosy adventure with irresponsibly enticing Game Boy Advance-style visuals. It casts you as Hoshino, a teenage girl who's just moved to an old \"danchi\" housing complex and is trying to revive the yearly tradition of a summer festival. How will she do this? By means of haggling - haggling, and a bit of CSI. \r\n \nRead more",

Geopolitics are fractious and unnerving, environmental catastrophe seems more likely each day, and rampant digitally-disseminated disinformation further erodes our trust in one another. But I'll let lesser reporters tell you about that stuff. I'm here to report that Capcom have made the big bonk feel good again. They’ve heard player feedback on the missing weapon oomph caused by the lack of hitstop in the Monster Hunter Wilds beta, and they’re bringing back the bonk.\nHere’s a handy breakdown of the issue by X user Blue Stigma, but briefly: hitstop is the brief pause in an attack animation the moment the weapon connects with an enemy, giving you a real sense of bonkitude and making say, a hammer feel different from a dagger. As the video showed, the hitstop was greatly reduced in Wilds compared to previous Monster Hunters, and many players reported the combat just feeling a bit off as a result.\nRead more",

It is, in fact, the latest in a series of real-time strategy games in which you position turrets and terraform maps to repel surging, simulated tides of purple liquid. This is a war between flesh and mineral, solidity and fluidity that dates back to the age of Gillen. Alex Wiltshire (RPS in peace) interviewed creator Virgil Wall back in 2019 - amongst other things, we learn that the original Creeper World was based on a \"failure\" - and Sin has an  enthusiastic piece from 2021 about Creeper World 4, the first 3D instalment.\nWhat does Creeper World IXE bring to the party? Well, 1) it ain't 3D, and 2) it's billed as an exercise in \"dominating\" the titular Creeper, rather than keeping it at bay. For too long has this sloshing, coruscating hooligan been allowed to wash over and corrode our precious starports. We will take the fight to it in the shape of an upgradeable 2D starfleet, equipped with lasers we can use to chisel away the geography and re-rout the flow of villainous Vimto. \n Read more",

          "description": "“If, two months ago, you’d been told to close your eyes and imagine a Two Point game about a museum, you’d come up with something at least 85% identical to Two Point Museum,” wrote James, previewingishly. After spending a few hours with a beefier build, I’m inclined to agree. But, much like Campus (which gave you real incentive to actually run a smooth operation that genuinely benefited the lazy ratbags stinking up your dorm halls) it’s that extra 15% that really makes all the difference.\nJames already covered the new exhibits system, and how acquiring and displaying them changes the way you run things, but such globetrotting adventures do little to rattle the pulse of a world-weary mapmuncher like me. No, what I’m actually most excited for when Two Point Museum releases next February is possibly the most ostensibly uninteresting feature added to any videogame ever - partition walls.\nRead more",

With each mech able to become another mech's worse nightmare, it becomes a game about stretching tight budgets to balance reactive counters with devastating offensives; about identifying the butterfly wings that can send tornados through your opponent’s ranks.

          "description": "‘Confident’ game design is one of those slightly fluffy critic words I sometimes find myself reaching for tenuously, knowing that - sigh - I’m going to have to do all sort of detestable nonsense like ‘back up my vague assertion with concrete examples that are useful to the reader’ if I do. Yuck. If there’s one type of design that deserves the accolade, though, it’s RPGs that are assured enough in the richness of their worlds to not feel the need to signpost every discovery.\nIt’s a feedback loop of charitable feelings: the game is saying \"we think you’re smart enough to find this stuff on your own\". \"You’re right!\" you respond. \"I am smart! And anyone who recognises that must be one smart cookie\". Joy abounds, it rains Tunnock’s Caramel Wafers, hedgehogs jig gracefully in the street, and all is right with the world. So, I must say, I’m quite pleased to hear Avowed’s environment region director Berto Ritger sing the virtues of missable content to GamesRadar.\nRead more",

Glancing over that map as a newcomer to the game, my eye was caught by the creator's casual mention that Caves Of Qud is technically 2,147,483,646 levels deep.\n\"Is Caves Of Qud really 2,147,483,646 levels deep?\" I asked Brendy, like a wide-eyed child asking whether there is such a thing as dog heaven. Brendy wasn't sure. (About Caves Of Qud, I mean, not dog heaven.) So I put the question to one of the developers, Freehold Games co-founder Brian Bucklew. In brief, the answer is yes, but with some significant caveats.\n Read more",

Some NPCs wouldn’t be swayed by this, but some would lower their weapons at the offer of a prawn cocktail treat, and so you’d be constantly playing chicken with various guards: edging closer toward them, your shaking hands rattling the delicious disks inside the oily packet, mentally weighing up whether it's worth risking them turning hostile at the last second.\nObviously, I’d scan some real crisp packets and just alter the logos for maximum immersion. One game that’s already taken this scanned bricolage concept and run with it to beautiful effect is Hyperdrive Inn. It’s an avant garde point and click adventure from Finnish studio Horsefly, where the entire world is constructed from scanned fabric samples. Have a looksee.\nRead more",

Over in the US, meanwhile, the Gigabyte GeForce RTX 4060 Gaming OC is the most affordable of all; it’s a chunkier design than that of the compact Ventus 2X, though that’s mainly just the tradeoff for having an extra fan. These cards were already on the cheaper end of the RTX 4060 spectrum, and now they’re £30 / $35 off in the sales. Bargain.\nRead more",

It’s partly your fault, you know. You like it too much.\nThis time it’s down from £80 to £26 in the UK (£27 outside the Bezos Empire), which isn’t quite an all-time low, but is pretty close – and a silly-good price for such a capable mouse in any case. Its US discount price of $35 ain’t half bad either, though I notice Amazon US is shouting louder about knocking the newer G502 X down from $80 for $45. That’s mostly a fine mouse as well, though I find its redesigned scroll wheel a bit too much on scratchy side. Of the two, I’d stick with the classic.\nRead more",

          "description": "You can now knock down enemy dirtbags using a dinner plate as a violent frisbee in Selaco. Wonderful. The first-person shooter, which is replete with satisfying explosions, gunfire, bullet ricochets, smashing glass, sparks, goo, blood spatters, dust, ice particles, smoke, flecks of plaster, and bad guys yelling at one another about how she's over there, may be described as noisy, both in the aural and visual sense of the word. Which is how we like it, you understand. This latest update to the early access shooter leans into that by layering on even more juicy shootFX. It also adds a whole new game mode and plenty of other tweaks. The bad news is that some story bits are now delayed.\nRead more",

Doubly so in the wake of The Callisto Protocol - a game I still think is worth picking up on a deep discount, if you like hitting gross things with a big bit of metal. It’s quite exciting, then, to learn that the next game from Lies Of P developer Round 8 Studios might just replace that severed limb.

          "description": "The genre of 'Action RPG' is supremely annoying to write about, because the term can mean different things to different people, but here’s how I see it: Diablo 4 and similar games, such as Path Of Exile, are 'ARPGs'. Which stands for 'Action RPG'. But Zelda games are 'Action RPGs', which is a totally different genre that you could, if you felt like it, also shorten to 'ARPG'. So, to summarise: ARPGs and ARPGs are two different things, and both are Action RPGs. Got it? Great.\nIt’s because of this kerfuffle that I’m not exactly mad at Diablo boss Rod Fergusson recently suggesting that we just call games that are similar to Diablo 'Diablo-likes'. I just find it very funny that he’s the one saying it, in a bold faced act of admittedly very inconsequential linguistic colonialism that carries the unspoken connotation that something is \"like the game I make, but a bit crap\".\nRead more",

Here's the gist of it: I've had enough of gathering rocks and sticks to make a crafting bench, from which I'm forced to build a hut and so on. I'm sure for some this is riveting, but for me, it's something I tire of within seconds.\nAnd so it's with a heavy heart I say that Towers Of Aghasba suffers from the same starting gamut of sticks and stones. There's a hint of some interesting ecosystem stuff springing up a bit later, and judging by the trailers, an ability to clamber on massive flying creatures made of what looks like elephant skin and hair. Still, I just can't do it.\nRead more",

          "description": "I've gone on record as not being a huge fan of the artstyle choices used in the new Warcraft I & II remasters. It's crisp and readable, sure, but I'm never exactly thrilled to see all the roughness of older sprites completely done away with, especially when I always felt some of that ruggedness was the point. The tendency of remasters to treat every characterful oddity as a blemish is a wider topic than the scope of this article, but one day, Bluepoint will remaster Bloodborne, and the world will feel my pain. \nAnyway. Nowadays, I'd say Blizzard - or, World Of Warcraft, at least - is pretty much synomous with a softer, more colorful approach to fantasy worlds. While I don't pine for a return to the more boobily ridiculous elements of Frank Frazetta's style, I do often wish that some of the more expressive, pained, and physically grounded elements of classic Sword And Sorcery art was a bit more common. I'm no art scholar, and there's undoubtedly a bit of tunnel vision of my part to this assertion, but as far as as pop culture goes: I see the Blizzard version of fantasy more than I see the Frazetta version, and I don't exactly love it. Same goes for the older, punkier, less uniform sci-fi art from things like 2000 AD and Warhammer 40,000. Edwin touched on some of this in his excellent Space Marine piece. \nAnyway, a valued RPS community member on the Discord shared an older bit of art by Blizzard's Chris Metzen, from the original Starcraft manual. I figured a few of you might enjoy seeing these older pieces, considering how much the overall look of their games has changed over the years. \nRead more",

These codes can be shared by anyone who has already created an account, and they can be used by anyone looking to play the game for the first time. Let's take a look at how you can use the codes and the rewards you can get from them.\n\n\nHow to redeem Assemble Codes in Marvel Rivals\n\n\nLet's first take a look at how you can redeem the codes. For that, start Marvel Rivals and let the shaders load up.\n\n\n\nOpen the in-game settings.\n\n\nSelect the Community Tab.\n\n\nGo to the Hero Assembly Event.\n\n\nYou'll get the code that you can share with anyone you want.\n\n\n\nImage via Destructoid\n\n\nNow, there are some rules that guide the use of Assemble Codes. To share your code, you'll need to reach level 5. This isn't a difficult task and can be achieved quite quickly. If you want to use someone else's code, make sure you haven't signed up yet.\n\n\nOnce someone has used your code and reached level 10, both of you will get 300 units. Additionally, a maximum of five players can use your code and get a maximum of 1500 units.\n\n\nHow to get more Assemble Codes in Marvel Rivals\n\n\nWhen it comes to these codes, the idea is to make sure that it reaches as many players as possible. That way, there's a higher chance for your code to be used by five players (and get 1500 units). It's easy to check the game's Discord server, where you'll find players looking to input codes.\n\n\nIf you're looking for a code to redeem, Discord servers will once again be the go-to destination, as you can find Assemble Codes shared by others.\n\nThe post How to find and use Assemble Codes in Marvel Rivals appeared first on Destructoid.",

Many are wondering, however, if there are any Infinity Nikki gacha elements to worry about. \n\n\nAre there Infinity Nikki gacha elements?\n\n\nInfinity Nikki has you collect costumes for special abilities and gorgeous new outfits to wear in the game. While some can be received by simply progressing in the game, other outfits are exclusively gacha. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nHow does the gacha system work?\n\n\nIt works very similarly to Genshin Impact. You can get four- and five-star outfits from the Resonance (like Wish) system. With every 10 Revelation or Resonite Crystals, you'll get a guaranteed  4-star or higher piece of an outfit. You'll need to gain Stellarites or Diamonds to get these Crystals. \n\n\nDiamonds act similarly to Primogems if you've played Genshin Impact. You'll gain them from completing quests and finishing in-game activities. These diamonds can be used to get the Revelation and Resonite Crystals. You'll need 120 of them to gain one, so 1,200 Diamonds are required to gain a 10-pull. \n\n\nIf you want to skip the Diamond grinding, you can pay for Stellarites, another currency that can be used to gain Crystals. They cost the following in real money:\n\n\n60\n$0.99 USD / $1.29 CAD\n\n\n300\n$4.99 USD / $6.99 CAD\n\n\n980\n$14.99 USD / $19.99 CAD\n\n\n1980\n$29.99 USD / $39.99 CAD\n\n\n3280\n$49.99 USD / $65.99 CAD\n\n\n6480\n$99.99 USD / $129.99 CAD\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the first top-up, you'll get a double bonus. For example, if you spend $0.99 on 60 Stellarites, you'll get a bonus 60 Stellarites for 120 in total.\n\n\nCertain costumes can be purchased outright. If you head to the bottom tab of the Store, you can access four different outfits, such as the Scalry Dream dress. They each vary in press and might be on sale.\n\nThe post Is Infinity Nikki a gacha game? appeared first on Destructoid.",

These are a great way to get your hands on valuable rewards, but you need Vital Energy to take part in the challenges. \n\n\nVital Energy is the currency that you pay to take part in Realm Challenges, and how much you’ll use in each Realm differs. If you’ve depleted your supply and want to go back for more, here’s how you can get more Vital Energy. \n\n\nHow to get Vital Energy in Infinity Nikki\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you’re patient and want to restore your Vital Energy without spending any precious resources, then you’re in luck because Vital Energy will replenish by one every five minutes, so you’re going to get your supply back eventually if you just wait a little while and do other things. \n\n\nHowever, if you want to speed things along and get straight back to the action, you have a couple of options:\n\n\nPurchase Vital Energy with Diamonds\n\n\nSpending 50 Diamonds will restore 80 Vital Energy, which is enough to dip into the Realm of Eureka or the Realm of the Dark twice. However, you can only do this six times per day, costing 800 Diamonds and granting a maximum of 480 Vital Energy. \n\n\nPurchase Vital Energy with Energy Crystals\n\n\nAlternatively, you can spend some Energy Crystals. These are rewarded for a number of things, including progression through the main story, completing side quests, opening up treasure chests, and through the Mira Journey. \n\n\nYou can use as many Energy Crystals as you like, and they’ll also grant you 80 Vital Energy per Crystal that you spend. While this may seem like the preferable method to get your Energy back, bear in mind that the supply of Energy Crystals is going to diminish eventually, so it might be worth hoarding them and keeping them at hand for when this happens. \n\nThe post How to get and use Vital Energy in Infinity Nikki appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "If you’re wondering what SVP means in Marvel Rivals, I’m going to do what I’m not supposed to do in these sorts of articles and just give you an answer: it means Second Valuable Player.\n\n\nSo, if MVP means Most Valuable Player, then SVP is the runner-up: the Second Valuable Player. Another possible acronym could be SMVP or “Second-Most Valuable Player,” but I guess that doesn’t look as flash.\n\n\nI don’t have much else to talk about, so let’s explore that. SVP is already a fairly common acronym. I don’t know if you see it much in other countries, but here in Canada (even the English-speaking parts), we see it as S'il Vous Plaît, which is French for please. In business, it is often seen as an abbreviation for Senior Vice President. In a legal sense, it’s sometimes applied to… Well, you can look that up if you want, but it’s a little dark for this subject matter, so we’ll leave that there.\n\n\nIn Marvel Rivals, the MVP and SVP are picked based on a number of factors, including KDR (Kill-Death Ratio), damage output, and damage healed or blocked. To boil it down in the most obvious way, it’s how much a person contributed to their team’s success based on metrics. I just felt like stressing that, since – and this is absolutely just hypothetical – someone being really encouraging over voice chat and keeping morale up on their team could – and again, this is hypothetical – have had the greatest positive effect on their team, but there’s no way for the scoring system to know that.\n\n\nAnd really, some people may let chasing score get in the way of their sportsmanship. If someone is selfish chasing higher numbers at the expense of their team’s strategy or the enjoyment of others, then they could become MVP or SVP. The scoring system would be able to tell either way.\n\n\nBut I digress. If you scrolled down here figuring the answer would be at the end, I’ll give it to you again: SVP means Second Valuable Player.\n\nThe post What does SVP mean in Marvel Rivals? Answered appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Castle Master, the haunting conclusion to the Freescape engine saga, is now ready for public testing!\nPrepare yourself for a perilous adventure as you lower the drawbridge to enter the Castle Master’s domain. Released in 1990 by Incentive Software, Castle Master became popular for its technical innovation and challenging gameplay. The game inspired countless 3D adventure titles, and the Freescape engine itself marked a technological milestone, enabling groundbreaking object interaction and spatial puzzles.\nNotably, Castle Master was one of the first games to let you choose to play as either a prince or a princess, offering a different experience depending on your choice.\nYour mission: rescue your twin, imprisoned within the eerie depths of Castle Eternity by the evil Magister. This sprawling, foreboding castle is filled with traps, monsters, and puzzles blocking your path. Gather items, unlock doors, and solve complex riddles as you navigate the labyrinthine halls and confront the dark forces within.\nThis modern reimplementation showcases enhanced graphics using OpenGL, with initial support for the DOS and ZX Spectrum releases. If you’re eager to embark on this dark journey, a playable demo is available to test your tenacity.\nTo participate in the testing, ensure you have a daily development build. We encourage all players to submit feedback and bug reports through our issue tracker.\nWill you brave the creepy corridors of Castle Eternity and free your sibling, or will you fall victim to the Magister’s curse and join his army of enslaved spirits? The adventure awaits!\n>",
