It's a great DLC, not just because it has loads of nods to the older Tomb Raider games, but also because if you're just in it for the powerwashing, you've got some lovely levels to clean, with nooks and crannies and satisfying walls to scour. My favourite thing about it, however, is that it kind of canonically confirms Lara is an ass.\nRead more",

Living in a cute little thatched roof house, tending to your garden, baking bread, sipping magical teas, reading old tomes on the front porch - absolute bliss.\nWitchy Life Story is all about this lifestyle.

The town is preparing for a festival and, as the newly appointed town witch, you need to pull your weight by brewing potions, giving tarot readings, and even leading a guided meditation session or two.\nRead more",

          "description": "The RPS Time Capsule returns for its first outing of 2023, and this time we're casting our minds back to the hallowed year of 2006. Little did we know it at the time, but this is the year we start to see the birth of certain game series that are still alive and kicking today (just about), as well as the nascent beginnings of now beloved studios honing their craft on some of their very first titles. But which of those games have earned themselves a spot in the eternal RPS Time Capsule? Come and find out which ones have stood the test of time, and which, after reading this article, have been consigned to the smog-filled trashfire of future Earth.\nRead more",

          "description": "I hesitate to call Potion Tales a shop sim or retail management game, because the economics of running a figuratively and literally underground magic potion shop seems a secondary concern next to making the potions and deciding whether you want to screw people over or not. If the answer to that last part is yes, you need to move on to the question of how.\nIn practice, Potion Tales is a 3D puzzle game. People come to you - I use the term people broadly because the tutorial level involves helping a fire spirit and soon after you're approached by what appears to be an aggressive daisy who is the local gravekeeper - and present you with a problem. They ask for a potion to solve the problem. That's all the steer you get. It takes some getting used to, but the Steam demo shows an impressively flexible game with a good sense of humour.\nRead more",

As it turns out, I've also had a sneak peek at the Next Fest build, too, and there's a heck of a lot to sink your teeth into. Here's a small glimpse of what to expect. \nRead more",

There’s something meditative about being close to the water, waiting in silence for a catch, and mashing buttons to reel them in - plus I don’t need to deal with the horrendous smell from behind the safety of my desk.

It's a bit like Blood Bowl, oddly, in that it's all about mitigating risks. And like Blood Bowl, despite having a decent head for tactics and planning on the fly, I am hopeless at sticking to them when I see a new idea, thus: terrible. At it.\nBut since an update last March looks likely to be its last big one, it's about time to get over myself and gave it a proper look as a complete package. It's long overdue, in fact. Although I still struggle to fully enjoy it, Battle Brothers is an unusually good tactical game, and the one to beat for the burgeoning subgenre of mercenary management sims. That's partly because it sticks so resolutely to its guns. Where Bannerlord faltered by throwing extraneous stuff unrelated to the core combat that should have defined it, and other open world games typically take a varied but shallow \"do and be everything\" approach, Battle Brothers resists dilution of that core concept.\nRead more",

If KeokeN's Deliver Us games are anything to go by, though, life in outer space isn't all that peachy either. In Deliver Us The Moon, you may remember the scientists in charge of the moon's Earth-saving energy beam tech ended up having a bit of a Rapture moment, sabotaging all their good work (and the future of Earth in the process) and buggering off to goodness knows where to start life afresh in their newly birthed utopia. In its sequel, Deliver Us Mars, you find out those rogue astronauts didn't actually go that far at all. Yep, they hopped on over to the red planet and set up shop there, and when a strange transmission comes through revealing their location, it serves as the catalyst to send yet another crew into space to go and investigate. \r\n\nThis time, though, you're right at the heart of its central conflict. By casting players as Kathy, the daughter of one of those rogue astronauts, Deliver Us Mars tells a much more fraught and personal tale of what kind of future humanity should be pursuing: should we, in fact, be turning our efforts toward a life in outer space, or should we be doing everything in our power to try and save the dire, pretty much almost dead husk of a planet we call home? \nRead more",

Let your eyes go slack and gaze into the distance of an optical illusion as you jump around pretty little Magic Eye levels in this platformer which reminds me of VVVVVV.\nRead more",

Being developed by Daemon House, this is an oceanic survival horror where you’re trapped in a derelict submarine that has sunken to the depths of an abyssal sea. You need to navigate your surroundings and keep the sub up and running to make your way back to civilisation, aka a rusty tin can is your last lifeline.\nRead more",

Indeed, just like the 2K Launcher last year, with the added irony that the affected games (which include The Division 2, Watch Dogs Legion and Ghost Recon Breakpoint) only arrived on Steam in the past few weeks. \nRead more",

I might smugly write something like “it elevates the genre” while sipping wine and eating cheese, musing on how a game pushes the media forward as an art form. Other times I just want to write that a game is really bloody good, actually, and I like it lots.\nHi-Fi Rush falls into the latter category. Developer Tango Gameworks shadow-dropped the rhythm-action game out of nowhere shortly after an Xbox presentation, jettisoning The Evil Within’s murky mental hospitals and Ghostwire: Tokyo's supernatural shinanigans for something markedly different: bright pulsating neon colours and a gang of loveable anime ruffians, where every whack and dodge is underscored by a beat. \nHi-Fi Rush is an action-adventure game with a mechanical core fuelled by musical beats. Protagonist Chai has undergone a risky medical procedure and emerged from the other side with a robot arm and an iPod accidentally implanted in his chest meaning his every waking moment is punctuated by a catchy beat. We too see these rhythmic motions, as Hi-Fi Rush's soda pop-infused world moves to this steady pulse - platforms move in time with the music, lights flash in pleasing rhythmic patterns, and enemies attack to the beat of the drum. \nRead more",

It’s Minecraft! Of course it was game of the year. It was arguably the game of the decade, an absolute all timer. I won’t spend many words explaining why it is good, because those words would be redundant fodder, like the bloke fighting a soaring dragon by poking the ground under his feet with a sword. I’ll give it a fair go so that Alice can’t say I didn’t try, and swiftly move on to reading all of your (hopefully) lovely comments about why you also like Minecraft.

But Yaza Games have taken a bit of a different direction with Inkulinati's vibe by adding a whole heap of cheeky humour. You wouldn't think it would suit the stuffy nature of religious manuscripts, but actually those monks were pretty cheeky blokes, and Inkulinati's humour is done in a way that stays completely loyal to the source material, fart jokes and all.\nRead more",

If only Jett had embraced a rhythm as organic as its inspired ecosystem.”\r\n\n\r\nWhen the Jett team read that review, they didn’t disagree. “You put your finger on it more accurately than anybody else, which was, ‘It really feels like this is building up to some sort of systemic-focused, open world endgame,’” says Superbrothers founder Craig Adams. “And internally we were like, ‘Yeah, it is.’” What they knew, and I didn’t, was that The Far Shore was just the first part of a two-campaign story. That journey has now been completed with the launch of Given Time, a bonus 12-hour adventure that coincides with Jett’s long-awaited Steam release. \r\n\n \nRead more",

With that in mind, I dove into the game's recent technical test with fellow RPS Treehouse-dwellers Ollie and James to sample the game at a more leisurely pace, and to draw upon their greater strategic expertise. Did the combat hold up? Were they pleased to be dragged into a co-op session with me? Yes... and no. We had fun, but it didn't come quite as naturally without the guiding hand of the developers showing us the ropes.\nRead more",

There's the eldest, who will always be heaped with praise because no matter what the others achieve, she did it all first. Her twin is always keen to remind you that even though she's the younger and perhaps not quite as accomplished half of the duo, she's more charismatic and less coy about who she is and what she wants. Then there's the youngest, who's extremely likeable, in large part because she's learned what behaviours to avoid just by watching the others make mistakes; even if she's modelled herself on the eldest a bit too closely in her quest for approval, and so hasn't really forged her own identity.\nThen there's Life Is Strange 2: the awkward middle child. Still very recognisably a member of the family, but the one that stands out in all the photos because he's just a bit gawky. He's experimented a lot with his storytelling and plotline in an attempt to make himself stand out, and it's only sort-of worked. His romantic subplots are underdeveloped, his villains are one-dimensional, and his attempt at tackling a Very Serious Issue has grown in all crooked.\nRead more",

French union Solidaires Informatique said that Guillemot’s \"words mean something: overtime, managerial pressure, burnout, etc,\" and called on Ubisoft Paris employees to strike for better pay and working hours.

After an eight-year absence, the next entry in Ubisoft’s beloved city-building series was finally revealed in 2018, only to be delayed indefinitely two years later. The game then reemerged in a fresh new form in 2022, but a less than favourable reception from long-term fans to its closed beta saw the game delayed indefinitely once again.\r\n\n\r\n12 months later, The Settlers: New Allies is all the better for it. An extended delay is never an easy decision to make, yet the team at Ubisoft Düsseldorf (formerly Blue Byte) has seen this additional development time as an opportunity to reach out to those most familiar with the series. “We learned [more] than just what was needed for the game,” creative director Christian Hagerdorn tells me during a recent preview event. “One of our biggest focuses was to be absolutely transparent with the players. Not just on where we were standing, but where we were going. We've been collecting the feedback as we were developing”.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's all very well being able to zoom around doing magic parkour everywhere, but there isn't much to do or many places to go. Not a single talking unicorn to be seen.\nForspoken is somehow both full and devoid of content. There is a huge open world, but it is mostly empty. There is an epic story of magic, other universes, and saving the world, but it only takes up a couple of days. I actually enjoyed a lot of Forspoken, but it gets more fun the more you play, and then it's over; I didn't pre-order this game for sixty odd quid, and if I had I'd be disappointed. Even the much-Tweeted about annoying dialogue doesn't happen much, and isn't contextually annoying. Forspoken is annoying, though, just not in the ways you might expect if all you've seen is people discussing out-of-context clips from cutscenes.\nRead more",

          "description": "Dream life sim PowerWash Simulator is heading on another unexpected mission, this time to Final Fantasy 7’s industrial city of Midgar. You’ll need to wait a little longer to help Cloud and friends clean up the city, as we don’t have a release date for the free Midgar Special Request DLC yet. The crossover pack’s announcement (via the Square Enix Extreme Edges Twitter account) did tease a few of the things we can expect to clean up, including the Seventh Heaven bar, and FF7’s first boss the Guard Scorpion. The teaser image also shows off the motorcycles from FF7’s mini-game, so I’ll be expecting to hose that down in time for a quick escape.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Some developers spend their careers inching towards their dream job, leapfrogging between roles in a grand strategy game of their own making. Others, like Randy Smith, simply show up on their first day and find they’re exactly where they’re meant to be.\r\n\n\r\n“The approach that Looking Glass had to creating games was pretty unique,” he says now. “Even to this day, there are few studios who have that same ideology and mindfulness in how videogames are made.”\r\n\n\nThief: The Dark Project had a great director, in the form of Greg LoPiccolo, who later became a pioneer in the world of music games with Guitar Hero and Rock Band. And before him, Ken Levine had laid down the cobbles of Thief’s setting, defining its noir-ish tone before heading off to work on System Shock 2. Yet Looking Glass games weren’t driven by a singular 90s auteur. In fact, the very absence of ego in the studio’s culture meant its many “bright stars” were happy to adhere to a shared vision.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Fedora 38 nabídne celý Flathub. Od Fedory 35 platí, že pokud si v edici Workstation při úvodním nastavení povolíte zdroje třetích stran, nastaví se vám mezi těmito zdroji také Flathub. Ten k dnešnímu dni nabízí zhruba 2000 aplikací ve formátu Flatpak, mezi nimiž naleznete i ty proprietární, které ve Fedoře nejsou k dispozici. Doteď se ale Flathub nastavoval pouze ve filtrované podobě. Dokud si uživatel sám Flathub nepřidal, měl z tohoto zdroje k dispozici jen krátký seznam schválených aplikací. To se změní s Fedorou 38. FESCo schválilo návrh, podle kterého se po povolení zdrojů třetích stran nastaví nefiltrovaný Flathub. Uživatel tak bude mít po zaškrtnutí jedné volby k dispozici stovky dalších aplikací včetně těch populárních jako Steam, VLC, Chrome nebo Spotify. Oficiální repozitáře Fedory ale budou mít i nadále prioritu. To znamená, že když se bude aplikace nacházet jak v repozitářích Fedory, tak na Flathubu, v GNOME Software bude vždy předvolená verze z Fedory.",

          "description": "Jako každý měsíc je zde Virtuální Bastlírna s novinkami ze světa bastlení, elektroniky, vědy a techniky. Tento měsíc se navíc opravdu urodilo. Co si tedy bastlíři z projektu MacGyver.sh připravili?\r\n\r\nZe světa software například zajímavá betaverze LTSpice 17.1, která umí počítat charakteristiku spínaných zdrojů z tranzientní simulace. Zároveň je tu první release candidate KiCADu 7 a brzy by měla být plnohodnotná verze 7. Nebo třeba aplikace, kterou můžete vyfotit klíč a jednoduše vytvořit výkres pro klíč, aby šel vyrobit duplikát. Vědci otestovali, jak pomocí sady ESP32 mapovat nejen počet osob v místnosti, ale i jak se zrovna pohybují a co dělají. ST Microelectronics má zase nový nástroj pro vývoj machine learning aplikací.\r\n\r\nNovinky jsou ale i ze světa hardware. ST Microelectronics má nové řady procesorů C0 a U5. Renesas zase uvádí na trh řadu nových malých FPGA s předpokládanou cenou $0.5/kus. Česká společnost vyvíjející unikátní kryptočipy má už první vzorky pro testování.\r\n\r\nI ze světa bastlení se však najdou novinky. Kupříkladu detekce chemických sloučenin pomocí odezvy na vysokofrekvenční pole, doporučení, jak dělat spolehlivě zapájitelné footprinty 0402 a 0201 součástek nebo jak se dělá plošný spoj, který se umí sám zapájet.\r\n\r\nAť už vás zaujalo cokoliv z nabízených témat, chcete ukázat nějaký svůj bastl a nebo si jen potřebujete postěžovat na nedostatek volného času, dorazte! Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat v úterý 7. února od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.",

          "description": "Pokemon Scarlet & Violet surpass expectations as well\nJust today we touched base with Nintendo to see how their top 10 all-time best-seller list for Switch was doing, and Pokemon Scarlet & Violet kind of smashed the windows on the way in. It turns out a few other games are doing well, too!\nNintendo reports that Splatoon 3 has sold 10.13 million units since its September 2022 launch, firmly placing it just outside of the top 10 list, somewhat in reach of Pokemon Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee's 15.07 million. It just needs to best two more games to catch up to Splatoon 2, and four more games to crack the top 10. Given how Splatoon games typically have decent tails, it should at least climb a few more spots before it settles in.\nIn the wide world of digital recreational activity, Nintendo Switch Sports commanded a respectable 8.61 million units, putting it directly in the top 20 all-time best-selling Switch game list. This kind of came out of nowhere for me, as I hardly ever hear about it in passing, but there's likely enough nostalgia there for the original Nintendo-branded \"Sports\" series that you just don't ponder on a regular basis.\nBig picture, Nintendo now has 27 games that are million-sellers; with Pokemon Scarlet/Violet, Xenoblade Chronicles 3, Mario Strikers: Battle League, Kirby and the Forgotten Land, and Pokemon Legends: Arceus joining those ranks in 2022.\nA full breakdown of Nintendo's sales trends for 2022 and part of 2023\n[caption id=\"attachment_361724\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Nintendo[/caption]\nThe post Splatoon 3 pushes over 10 million units since launch, Switch Sports is right behind it appeared first on Destructoid.",

Nintendo is hosting a tried and true Nintendo Direct on February 8 at 5PM ET, which will run \"roughly 40 minutes.\"\nHere's the full rundown from Nintendo, since I know you Direct-heads love to get the full scoop:\n\"Tune in tomorrow, Feb. 8, at 2 p.m. PT for a Nintendo Direct livestream featuring roughly 40 minutes of information mostly focused on Nintendo Switch games launching in the first half of 2023.\"\n\nThat's basically everything I already recapped above: with no extra special provisos (like \"X will not be shown\"). 40 minutes is a meaty timeframe, and Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom does fit into that \"first half\" bit. For reference, the last proper Direct was held on September 13, 2022.\nAs far as what to expect, we'll likely see a recap of things that were revealed in the last week, like Kirby's Dream Land Switch additions, as well as the long-rumored final release date (or instant drop) of Advance Wars Switch. Fans have been waiting years to hear any major updates for Hollow Knight: Silksong, among other first-party games like Metroid Prime 4 and Pikmin 4.\nEither way, tune in and follow along with the news on Destructoid's front page on February 8. Covering these is like a reflex for us!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdUSVSEp7U\nThe post A Nintendo Direct is happening this week, will deal with “games launching in the first half of 2023” appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is still on top\nNintendo has provided new top-selling investor relations software sales data on its official site, and the top 10 has shifted slightly. So what changed?\nWell, interestingly enough, Pokemon Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl dropped off the list entirely, despite holding firm at the number eight slot the last time we checked in. Essentially taking its spot in the top 10, Pokemon Scarlet & Violet shot up to seventh place, while Super Mario Party, Ring Fit Adventure, and Pokemon Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee refused to leave. The top six best-sellers (below) remain exactly the same.\nIn terms of sales, everything shot up a bit, ranging from 1-4 million more sales since the last September 30 2022 marker, with Mario Kart 8 pushing a remarkable 1.6 million units in that timeframe. You can see why it continues to shoot out DLC! Other top games held on, including Zelda: Breath of the Wild, which will likely continue getting a big bump from Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom throughout the year.\nAs for what's next, expect Scarlet & Violet to climb considerably, likely overtaking Pokemon Sword/Shield eventually as the best-selling Pokemon game on Switch. It's a shame Legends still isn't anywhere to be found!\nHere's the full Switch best-seller list as of December 31, 2022\nMario Kart 8 Deluxe - 52 million\nAnimal Crossing: New Horizons - 41.59 million\nSmash Ultimate - 30.44 million\nZelda: Breath of the Wild - 29 million\nPokemon Sword/Shield - 25.68 million\nSuper Mario Odyssey - 25.12 million\nPokemon Scarlet/Violet - 20.61 million\nSuper Mario Party - 18.79 million\nRing Fit Adventure - 15.22 million\nPokemon Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee - 15.07 million\nThe post Nintendo updates its Switch best-seller list, as Pokémon Scarlet & Violet sell heaps appeared first on Destructoid.",

Episode 5 of The Last of Us will be streaming a few days earlier, on February 10 at 9 p.m. ET.\nThis perk will be available for both HBO Max users, who will be able to check out the new episode a little bit earlier. It will still make its HBO premiere on Sunday, February 12 at 9 p.m. ET. This is the one and only episode to do so, as the rest will continue to air on Sundays at 9 p.m. ET.\nhttps://twitter.com/TheLastofUsHBO/status/1622611081087844352\nWhy the two-day early premiere? Well, no official reason was given in HBO's press release. But those tuned into the sports world already know. This weekend is the Super Bowl, and it looks like HBO might look to avoid a direct clash between its new episode and massive sporting event.\nThough other competition has existed for the Sunday slot, and The Last of Us has won out, it seems like HBO is making an effort to avoid the clash for this particular event. Thus, Episode 5 of The Last of Us will go live a little bit earlier. At least that's less waiting between cliffhangers.\nLast Friday night\nIt's at least a good sign for the series that HBO wants to keep its momentum rolling. The show has garnered general praise, and seems to at least be on the upper-end of the scale compared to most live-action video game adaptations.\nThe first season is expected to run through March 12, which is when its finale airs. It's already been renewed for a second season as well, so HBO really does seem to be betting on The Last of Us.\nMeanwhile, PC fans holding out for the chance to play the first installment themselves are waiting a little longer, as the PC port of The Last of Us Part I has been pushed back further into March.\nThe post PSA: The Last of Us Episode 5 hits steaming earlier this week appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Rowr, Fsss! Fsss!\nMovie-licensed games have long been given a bad rap, but to be fair to them, that’s only because they’re usually bad. This goes back to the ‘80s, with some of the earliest video games to hit the market. I don’t have an explanation for why these titles are often bad. The fact that they have to be rushed to meet the same release date as the movie certainly does no favors. However, my theory is that, when a game already has advertising that comes from a larger industry, why even bother trying to make it good? It’s going to sell on recognition alone.\nWith that in mind, here we have 2004’s Catwoman, based on the film starring Halle Berry. It has the distinction of being based off what is considered by some to be one of the worst big-budget films of all time. It would be really…",

          "description": "Deep into that darkness peering…\nRed Hook Studios has announced that Darkest Dungeon II will end its early access run on Epic Games Store and enter the light on May 8, 2023. The game is a follow-up to 2016’s Darkest Dungeon, a title focused on the mental rigors of dungeon delving.\nRather than simply focus on being an adventuresome RPG, Darkest Dungeon gave your party the glossy sheen of human weaknesses. Instead of being buff and daftly courageous heroes, your group would be affected by the horrors that they saw in the gloom beneath the earth.\n[embed]https://youtu.be/sJ6Gdd-pSPA[/embed]\nDarkest Dungeon II continues the series’ take on stress management but makes wholesale changes to a lot of the system. A focus for a lot of pre-release information is the wagon that you drive to travel the game world, but the combat system has been reworked. A lot has changed alongside that, and a many players voiced their disappointment in 2021 when the early access period launched. While I can’t personally speak to any of the changes that have been made or the quality, I have heard that the devs have been active about collecting feedback and tweaking the game based on that. Hopefully, this meant that the final release in a few months will meet expectations.\nI didn’t play the first Darkest Dungeon because people told me that it’s really depressing. Maybe I should give it a go once I give my therapist a proper warning.\nIf you’re unsure about the changes made, a demo has been made available as part of Steam Next Fest. Although the Early Access was exclusive to Epic Games Store, the full title will be available on both EGS and Steam when it launches on May 8, 2023.\nThe post Darkest Dungeon II snuffs out the light on May 8th appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Discover the secrets hidden away in shadows\nIf you've wished that action-platformers would lean a little more in the horror side, then Plot Twist's new game might be up your alley. The Last Case of Benedict Fox is due to arrive on April 27 for Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, and it's coming to Game Pass.\nPlaying as the titular Benedict Fox, your goal is to uncover your father's secrets following his untimely demise. Benedict isn't alone, however; he's accompanied by a strange, intimidating demon companion, and as he delves deeper into his father's memories, he'll also peer deeper into the abyss.\nIt's easy enough to sum up Benedict Fox by describing it as \"Lovecraft meets Metroidvania,\" but seeing it play out, the blend works. Developer Plot Twist put out a new guided gameplay look today, showing how investigation and mystery are in store for Benedict alongside the action.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKvv--Yc5Yk\nDefeating enemies lets Benedict build up ink, which he can then use to tattoo himself for more power. I dig the way these intersecting systems feed into the darker side of the story. It seems like The Last Case of Benedict Fox might be a good pick-up for those who want some more horror in their Metroidvanias.\nJoining the pass\nBenedict Fox is one of four games highlighted as coming to Xbox Game Pass today over on the Xbox Wire. The other games included are space-sim Everspace 2, side-scrolling narrative adventure Planet of Lana, and co-op mech-farming game Lightyear Frontier.\nIt's a pretty wide array of video game styles, and it's always nice to see a good variety of games headed to the Pass alongside the big Microsoft titles. Even though some big games are going to be swallowing up the oxygen for the foreseeable future, it's nice to get a spotlight on cool and interesting new games like The Last Case of Benedict Fox.\nThe post Lovecraft-vania The Last Case of Benedict Fox arrives in April appeared first on Destructoid.",

A new plush of Bridget, the yo-yo wielding fighter who made her re-entrance in Guilty Gear Strive not too long ago, is on the way.\nThe Bridget plush specifically highlights her Guilty Gear Strive appearance, down to blue hood and handcuff belt. The plush will go on sale first in Japan, but the Good Smile U.S. shop has pre-orders open. The plush will run $40.99 and is expected to start rolling out for Canada and the U.S. in August 2023.\nhttps://twitter.com/GoodSmile_US/status/1622429897695137792\nThe Bridget plush itself is 7.87 inches in height, made of polyester, and is super rad. So if you want to spotlight your main or just have a cute plush of a character you dig, it seems like a solid way to check that box.\nDoll fighter\nBridget has been in the Guilty Gear series for quite a while, but made her return to the modern roster last year in Guilty Gear Strive . A major part of her storyline was coming to terms with her upbringing and identity, eventually affirming her own sense of self. And somehow, Goldlewis Dickinson plays a role in it.\nIt's a heartwarming story, and that popularity ties in well with her yo-yo-flinging arsenal of moves and Strive's absolutely incredible style. So whether you're a new Bridget main or a longtime fan, now you've got a pretty decent merch option to clip onto your bag before the next Evo rolls around.\nGuilty Gear Strive is gearing up for another year of content, with an Xbox launch on the way. A cross-platform beta just took place too, so hopefully this means the online pool will be even larger as the year goes on.

Doing this will also net you the \"Crouching Dragon Helmet\" item.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlmdeQFyqC0\nOnline multiplayer will also be available in the final Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty demo. And a special launch window \"Baihu Armor\" has been revealed for anyone who gets the game by March 16, alongside the digital pre-order \"Zhuque Armor\" bonus.\nDynasty warriors\nWo Long: Fallen Dynasty has been quietly creeping up lists for games to keep an eye on this year. The latest action-RPG from Team Ninja does seem to carry on ideas from Nioh, while set in the Three Kingdoms era of China.\nWhile FromSoftware is well known for its ability to craft a punishing fantasy action-RPG, Team NInja has been honing its own skills within the genre. And from the impression we had with a recent hands-on, it seems like Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty is coming together to be a surprise hit for those who haven't been keeping an eye on it.\nWo Long: Fallen Dynasty is out on March 3 for Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.\nThe post Final Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty demo will go live on February 24 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "I like my swords like I like my future...\nDevolver Digital has announced that it will be bringing is More8Bit’s lo-fi action-adventure title to Switch and PC this year in Bleak Sword DX. While the title has been on Apple Arcade since 2019, Bleak Sword DX promises to be an “upgraded and definitive” version.\nIf you missed it because you don’t have phone, Bleak Sword is a diorama-style slasher that drops your pixelated self into action setpieces. True to its name, Bleak Sword features dark fantasy rendered in stylized pixel art, giving it an unnerving lo-fi feel. Rather than a cohesive adventure, each level is represented as a battle on a square of land.\n[embed]https://youtu.be/i1t8UzCkBWo[/embed]\nYou can play a Bleak Sword DX demo now\nThe demo is available as part of Steam Next Fest. I fired it up and gave it a playthrough in preparation for writing this. While you can see its retro roots in its rapid-fire pick-up-and-play design, its combat feels more akin to something like Tunic. You watch enemy patterns, roll out of the way, and parry when it feels safe to. The brief levels and simplistic foundation leave a bit to be desired, but it’s definitely not a bad experience at first impression. Notably, the soundtrack is done by Jim Guthrie, which is always a big draw for me.\nBleak Sword DX features a new mode with extra chapters and new level layouts. Beyond that, there are randomizer and boss rush modes. The visuals have also been tweaked to better fit the new platforms it finds itself on. The AI is “enhanced,” and there are additions to the combat system (like the aforementioned parry.)\nBleak Sword is currently available on iOS through Apple arcade. Bleak Sword DX will be available on Switch and PC later in 2023. Currently, you can try out the first chapter in the demo for Steam Next Fest.\nThe post Bleak Sword DX upgrades the bleakness this year on PC and Switch appeared first on Destructoid.",

Not only have they come up with mockups for brand new systems; they've also crafted incredible official-looking spinoffs of existing hardware.\nThat includes this \"Switch Lite OLED\" (from Redditor willierthanyou) themed after the upcoming Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.\n\nWould you buy a Switch Lite OLED?\nSo far, Nintendo has released a Switch Lite, and a Switch OLED: but not a Switch Lite OLED. There's no such limitations in mockup land though, as this Switch Lite OLED goes with the color scheme from the logo (and the general aesthetic of the Zelda: Breath of the Wild Sheikah tech). The back is adorned with a Triforce symbol, along with a cool little neon effect. Since it's a Switch Lite, the Joy-Con do not detach.\nThe same creator also dabbled in a custom Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Joy-Con mockup (as well as a Switch Dock) if you're interested in these designs. More of their designs can be found on their Instagram account if you dig them!\nIt's just a matter of time until Nintendo unveils more official creations for all of their AAA games coming this year.

The seasoned musician was one of five people up for a Grammy this year for video game music. This is the first year the category has been a part of the show, and given how instrumental music is to the gaming industry and how easy it is to access your favorite scores on Spotify and Apple Music, one would hope it will be here for many years to come. The award for Best Score Soundtrack for Video Games and Other Interactive Media, which is the award's official name, was handed out in the Grammy's pre-show, going to Economou for her work on the score soundtrack for Assassin's Creed Valhalla: Dawn of Ragnarok.\nDawn of Ragnarok is the expansion for AC Valhalla that was released in March of last year to decent reviews. Clearly, the music from the game was more than just decent as Economou managed to take the gramophone over some pretty tough competition. Other nominees including in this inaugural batch were Austin Wintory for Aliens: Fireteam Elite, Bear McCreary for Call of Duty: Vanguard, Richard Jacques for Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, and Christopher Tin for Old World.\nExpect to see Bear McCreary up for this award again next year with his work on the Game Award-winning score to God of War: Ragnarok. Here's to hoping with this category around, we'll start seeing every video game publisher releasing their scores and soundtracks commercially. I know I would appreciate having the entirety of the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 soundtrack at the ready for when I take my walks every day.\nThe post Assassin’s Creed Valhalla: Dawn of Ragnarok wins inaugural video game Grammy appeared first on Destructoid.",

Nina Willaims, star of Death by Degrees and also a Tekken mainstay, got her first solo trailer for the upcoming release of Tekken 8. Nina, sister of fellow fighter Anna Williams, sports an unforgettable look this time around, and I honestly can't take my eyes off of her. The last Tekken game that I played was Tekken Tag Tournament 2 for the Wii U and she was definitely one of my most played characters. Given her history with the series, I don't think there was ever a danger of Nina not appearing in Tekken 8, but I'm glad I didn't have to wait too long to get her confirmed.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3sAt0JbqNs\nThe reveal of Nina Williams for Tekken 8 follows previous trailers for the upcoming fighter that have confirmed other returning favorites. Other fighters set to appear in this highly anticipated sequel include:\nMarshall Law\nPaul Phoenix\nKing\nLars Alexandersson\nJin Kazama\nDevil Jin\nJun Kazama\nKazuya Mishima\nJack-8\nNina's trailer was just one of a few notable pieces of Tekken news today.

The video, posted below, also confirms Tekken 8 will include an optional simplified control scheme that combines the Easy Combo and Assist features from Tekken 7. Bandai Namco also confirmed the Tekken World Tour 2023 would return this year with Tekken 7 and the entire tournament would be fully offline.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-v47u-_LZOE\nTekken 8 is still without a set release date, but when the game does arrive, you'll be able to pick it up for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X|S.\nThe post Nina Williams comes guns ablazin’ into Tekken 8 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Players don the mighty armor of the sun god Apollo, who mounts his mighty steed Pegasus and embarks upon a mission to rescue his wife, Artemis, who has been abducted by the serpentine god, Typhon. Players guide Apollo through seven famously challenging stages, taking on notable boss characters such as Medusa, Antaeus, Cerberus, and The Sirens. Dusa would never.\nCheck out the …",

While there were still a handful of fun and time-consuming games released for the service, nothing came down the pipe that blew away my expectations or elevated itself above the best games available on the platform. I'm still playing a few games from last year — mostly just Cooking Mama: Cuisine! and Wylde Flowers — but at the turn of the new year, I was ready to finally say goodbye to the $5-a-month subscription once and for all.\nThen, just three days into 2023, we learned Pokémon developer Game Freak would be releasing a new version of its niche classic Pocket Card Jockey on the service in January.

Naughty Dog is pushing the release date of The Last of Us Part I on PC back, from March 3 to March 28.\nIt's only a few weeks, but the extra time will give the Naughty Dog crew a little extra time to work on the port. The developer says it's noticed that players have been jumping back onto the story with the PS5 version of The Last of Us, and it wants to make sure the PC version puts a good foot forward.\n\"And so we want to make sure that The Last of Us Part I PC debut is in the best shape possible. These additional few weeks will allow us to ensure this version of The Last of Us lives up to your, and our, standards. We are so excited to bring The Last of Us Part I to a new platform, reaching new and returning players with Joel and Ellie's unforgettable story of survival, and we hope that you'll continue to look forward to its PC release on March 28.\"\n\nIt's not a long delay, but it does push the PC version a bit out from the finale of the HBO series. Episode 9, the last one for this season, airs on March 12. Now, rather than arriving just ahead of the finale, it'll debut a few weeks after.\nhttps://twitter.com/Naughty_Dog/status/1621539243402174470/\nWe are the last of us\nThough Last of Us fans on PC might be waiting a little longer, it at least give them a bit of time to decompress from the HBO finale.

          "description": "Okay, brain. Don’t accidentally write “First Blood.”\nVampires are pretty hot, but relationship options with them are limited. You know, because they’re fictional, which always gets in the way of good romance. However, First Bite is a visual novel that knows what we want: dates with vampires. This February 14th, we’re getting even more of that in First Bite: Bad Blood because if there’s one thing better than vampire dating, it’s more vampire dating. But there’s more than just one thing that’s better. Consider werewolf dating. Also, consider minotaur dating.\nFirst Bite: Bad Blood picks up where the base game left off, serving as a sequel that again follows Noe, a freshly-chomped vampire who is adjusting to being a cold-blooded dead person. But I’m going to have to quote the developer directly on this one, because I’m not sure I can really put it better myself: “things aren’t quite as simple as you hoped when you’re being eased into vampire life by a murder-himbo obsessed with Eurodance, a narcissist with an online shopping addiction, and a wild card with a penchant for BDSM.” Sounds magma-hot.\n[caption id=\"attachment_361381\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via First Bite Games[/caption]\nThis time around, just to make things spicier, you’re going up against the most arousing force in the universe: bureaucracy. A missed email is all it takes to put your destiny in question, as the vampire council is a bit miffed about being snubbed. Wow, I can hardly contain the lust boiling atop that overwhelmingly erotic plot summary.\nSarcasm aside, First Bite is an LGBTQ+ friendly visual novel with a dark comedy approach. I’ve been going through a bit of a dry spell when it comes to my digital romances, so I might just have to sink my teeth into this one.\nFirst Bite is available right now on Steam and itch.io, its DLC, First Bite: Bad Blood will hit Steam on February 14, 2023, and can be pre-purchased on itch.io for $4.99.\nThe post Romantic visual novel First Bite getting Valentine’s Day DLC appeared first on Destructoid.",

But the roughly 18 hours I have played are helping to create a clear picture.\nIn that time, my most notable impression is that the developers have captured what is distinct and memorable about this fiction. Set many decades before the Harry Potter stories that unfolded in book and film, the game has a latitude to tell its own story with its own characters that is refreshing – even if there are a healthy smattering of familiar last names like Weasley and Black that are in the mix.

The game first entered early access in 2021 and, like the original, tasks players with taking a dozen heroes through dangerous dungeons. This time though, you’re guiding them on a treacherous caravan ride through five dangerous regions.\nHeroes can bond with or sour on each other via the Affinity System to create combat synergies or dysfunctions. Darkest Dungeon II also boasts a plethora of new upgrades and boons to bolster party members. The demo gives players access to the four starting heroes and two full regions to explore, but progress will not transfer to the full game. \nYou can play Darkest Dungeon II on Steam and the Epic Game Store.

Her other credits include Netflix's Jupiter's Legacy and contributions to the scores and soundtracks of movies like The Martian, Mulan (2020), and more, as reported by Variety. The publication reports that Economou thanked \"all of the people who fought tirelessly to bring this category to existence,\" thanking them for \"acknowledging and validating the power of game music.\" \n\n\nVariety also reports that prior to this year's Grammy awards, video game scores and soundtracks were eligible in the show's score category but only earned one nomination in more than 20 years. That nomination went to Austin Wintory for his score in 2012's Journey. Wintory was nominated this year, this time for his Aliens: Fireteam Elite score, alongside Bear McCreary for Call of Duty: Vanguard, Christopher Tin for Old World, and Richard Jacques for Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy. \nEconomou's Grammy was awarded during the main show's pre-show segment, hosted by Randy Rainbow, who might have not been familiar with Assassin's Creed Valhalla, if the way he announced the game's name last night is any indication. \ncan’t stop laughing at this guy announcing the Grammy win for Assassin's Creed Valhalla pic.twitter.com/vz9bTVZFTX\nFebruary 5, 2023\nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Assassin's Creed Valhalla review and then read our impressions of its Dawn of Ragnarok expansion. \n[Source: Variety]\nWhat video game score should win at next year's Grammys show?

The teaser gave us a glimpse of Cat Mario's appearance in the film, as well as Donkey Kong's reaction. Today, Universal, Illumination, and Nintendo released the official movie poster for the Super Mario Bros. Movie.\nIn this new poster, we get a cinematic glimpse of the cast of main characters that we know of so far, including Mario, Luigi, Peach, Toad, Bowser, Donkey Kong, and Kamek. Additionally, we see the opposing worlds in the apparent conflict of the film, with the darkness of Bowser's Castle contrasted by the bright and joyful Mushroom Kingdom. While nobody quite matches Donkey Kong and Toad's wide-eyed and unbridled bliss, every character on the poster is at least sporting a smirk.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie features an all-star cast, including Chris Pratt as Mario, Charlie Day as Luigi, Anya Taylor-Joy as Peach, Keegan-Michael Key as Toad, Jack Black as Bowser, Seth Rogen as Donkey Kong, and Fred Armisen as Cranky Kong. We also know that Mario's video game voice actor, Charles Martinet, will have a cameo in the film at some point.\nTo this point, the movie has only received character-focused posters on top of a teaser poster that preceded the initial movie trailer. If you missed out on those posters, you can see every other character and teaser poster released for The Super Mario Bros. Movie below.\n\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie arrives in theaters on April 7.

Led by directors Yasuhiro Ampo and Kazunori Kadoi, who now sit at the helm of Resident Evil 4, the game revitalized the 1998 classic, introducded it to a new generation of fans, and paved the way for the RE3 and 4 remakes to come after. Join me, Marcus Stewart, as I revisit my personal Game of the Year for 2019 to see how it holds up while discussing my Resident Evil 4 cover story.\n\n\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

Instead of releasing on March 3, the game now arrives on March 28.\nNaughty Dog wants more time to polish up the PC port, as stated in a message posted to Twitter that you can read in full below (click the image to enlarge). \nThe Last of Us Part I launched for PlayStation 5 last fall and serves as a ground-up remake of the 2013 title. It features improved graphics, reworked controls, improved enemy A.I., and a remade version of the Left Behind DLC chapter. The remake helped usher in the premiere of The Last of Us HBO series last month, which has been heavily watched and received heaps of praise thus far.

Roughly 50 people were on the team working on this game and EA will reportedly attempt to find positions for these employees elsewhere within the company. If positions cannot be found, some might be laid off with severance packages, according to Bloomberg. \n\n\nThe publication says Mohammad Alavi (Titanfall 2, Apex Legends designer) was set to direct this now-canceled game, but he left the company in 2022. \nIt's likely this canceled single-player game set in the Apex Legends and Titanfall universe was the one hinted at back in July in job postings that referred to the game as an \"Apex Universe FPS Incubation Title.\"\nWord of this cancelation comes shortly after EA announced it was shutting down Apex Legends Mobile and Battlefield Mobile, and shuttering the latter's developer, Industrial Toys, as well. Plus, in the same financial results where EA revealed it was shutting these games down, the company revealed that Respawn's upcoming single-player Star Wars game, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, had been delayed to April. \n[Source: Bloomberg]\nDo you think we'll ever get Titanfall 3?

          "description": "Sony's latest financial results covering Quarter 3 of Fiscal Year 2022, which consists of the last three months of the year, reveal the PlayStation 5 had its best quarter on the market yet. \nThe company has surpassed 32 million PS5 units shipped, sitting roughly at 32.1 million, after shipping 7.1 million during the last three months of 2022. It's important to note this isn't a sell-through number so theoretically, there could be consoles sitting on shelves still. But a company ships more units when the demand is there, so it's likely that the majority of these shipped consoles were sold. \nPlayStation did just as well on the first-party software side of things, selling 20.8 million during Q3 of Fiscal Year 2022, which is almost more than double the 11.3 million sold during the same period in 2021. Of those 20.8 million, roughly 11 million were of God of War: Ragnarok, which was the console's big holiday release. \n\n\nIncluding both first and third-party software, 86.5 million units were sold for the PS5, which is less than Q3 of Fiscal Year 2021 (92.7 million) but still an impressive number nonetheless. Sixty-two percent of the software sold this past quarter was digital. \nPlayStation Plus subscribers reached 46.4 million in Q3, which is up from Q2's 45.4 million but down from Q1's 47.3 million. The peak in the PS5's lifetime happened in Q3 of Fiscal Year 2021 at 48 million subscribers.\nIn terms of monthly active PlayStation users, Q3 reached a new peak for the current generation of PlayStation, hitting 112 million. That's up 10 million from the quarter before it and roughly 1 million more than the same quarter in 2021. \nAll told, Q3 of Fiscal Year 2022 was the PS5's best quarter yet. \nDid you pick up a PS5 this holiday season?

Sony didn't provide a reason for why it's closing the collection, but it also clarifies that other PS Plus perks, such as the monthly games, will not be affected. Here’s the full message below:\nThe PlayStation Plus Collection launched alongside the PS5 as an added bonus to those owners. In a way, it served as a mini-version of Xbox's Game Pass, albeit only featuring last-gen titles. The collection has remained largely the same since 2020, with a couple of titles joining the roster and only Persona 5 being removed from the original line-up last year. The PS Plus Collection currently consists of the following titles: \nBatman: Arkham Knight\nBattlefield 1\nBloodborne\nCall of Duty: Black Ops III: Zombie Chronicles Edition\nCrash Bandicoot N.Sane Trilogy\nDays Gone\nDetroit: Become Human\nFallout 4\nFinal Fantasy XV: Royal Edition\nGod of War (2018)\nInfamous: Second Son\nThe Last Guardian\nThe Last of Us Remastered\nMonster Hunter: World\nMortal Kombat X\nRatchet & Clank (2016)\nResident Evil VII: Biohazard\nUncharted 4: A Thief's End\nUntil Dawn\nLast year, Sony added two premium PlayStation Plus Subscription tiers that give those members access to a much larger (and more regularly updated) library of games across multiple generations of PlayStation. Premium members can access most, though not all, of these titles now, so perhaps Sony wants to incentivize standard PS Plus subscribers to upgrade. Regardless, be sure to nab these games now if you haven't already before the May 9 deadline sneaks up on you.",

          "description": "Amnesia: The Bunker, the next installment in the psychological survival horror franchise, arrives on May 16 instead of its original March window. \nThe Bunker offers a different spin on the Amnesia formula. Set during World War 1, players control a French soldier who gets separated from his comrades and trapped inside a military bunker. Within this labyrinthine, trap-laden sanctuary lurks a deadly creature that stalks the player, who must use their resourcefulness to survive. If you’re a fan of Alien: Isolation, The Bunker appears to aim for a similar style with a heaping dose of its signature mind-bending scares. Check out the original reveal trailer below.\n\n\nYou can check out Amnesia: The Bunker on Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.",

It is for this reason, after months of working with our development partner, that we have made the mutual decision to sunset our mobile game. Although disappointing, we are proud of the game we launched, are grateful for the support of the Apex Legends community, and are confident that this is the right decision for players.\" \nAll real-world money, in-app purchases have been disabled and the game has been removed from webstores.

For years, we dreamed about a lively city filled with people fighting to become a champion. We strived to create a vibrant place that celebrated the competitive spirit. Our goal was to bring joy back to online multiplayer gaming. The people who gave Rumbleverse a chance and took it on as a new hobby have validated every day that we put into bringing our ideas to life.”\nRumbleverse’s online servers shut down on February 28 at 10 a.m. CST. Players who spent any money on or within the game will receive refunds. That includes the Rumbleverse Battle Pass or Brawlla Bills on any platform. The current battle pass will also be given to all players free of charge with double XP gain. Certain emotes and accessories have been made free to acquire as well. Today, Iron Galaxy will close the in-game store and will release the final update. \nRumbleverse was first announced during the 2021 Game Awards and offered a unique spin to the battle royale with its emphasis on melee combat. After holding various beta tests throughout the first half of 2022, the game fully opened its doors in August to a generally warm reception from players and critics. You can watch us take it for a spin in this episode of New Gameplay Today Live. \nIn similar news, today Konami announced it's turning off the lights to its 2022 social deduction game, Crimesight.",

          "description": "Crimesight, a social deduction game released last year, got a surprising update on its steam page last night. Despite being out for less than ten months, Konami is ending support for it — and making the game unplayable.\n“Thank you for playing CRIMESIGHT,” the news post reads. “This service has continued to operate with the support of many users since its launch in April 2022, but due to various circumstances, we have decided to terminate the service on Monday, May 01, 2023 at 00:00 PDT.”\nSupport for an online game is bound to end at some point, but seeing the service cut off so quickly has many fans caught off guard. This is also the end of more than just the online modes. At the end of the post, Konami writes, “Also, the game itself won’t be able to play.” As a result, recent Steam reviews have a score of “Mostly Negative,” as players warn future buyers from purchasing a product that will soon be unplayable.\n【Important】 Service Termination Announcement\nhttps://t.co/v71WmsKCzE\nJanuary 30, 2023\nCrimesight is a multiplayer social deduction game set in a futuristic London. Moriarty's team seeks to commit a murder, and Sherlock's team tris to stop that from happening. While it was generally received positively by those that did play it, it didn't gain much traction. With only a handful of reviews on Metacritic and extremely low stats on SteamDB, a site that tracks concurrent player count, it's safe to say that one of Konami's \"various circumstances\" for canceling it is the size of its playerbase.\nIf you want to try it out, you've got until February to buy it, and until May before it stops working. If you want to try playing a different social deduction game, I've heard Among Us is good.\nDo you think Crimesight should stay on Steam? Let us know in the comments!",

          "description": "We already knew that 2023 was poised to be a big year for the Street Fighter franchise, thanks in large part to the impending launch of Street Fighter 6 this summer. However, Capcom and Crunchyroll Games are piling on with a new free-to-play mobile RPG called Street Fighter: Duel. If character collection games like Summoners War, Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, and Marvel Strike Force appeal to you, Street Fighter: Duel sounds like it shares many elements with those popular mobile titles.\nStreet Fighter: Duel includes more than 40 Street Fighter characters for players to recruit with the objective of building a team from across the franchise. Each team consists of three fighters who can be leveled up and customized with new skins. These fighters, who include characters like Ryu, Akuma, Chun-Li, Cammy, and more, all feature signature abilities and can pull off various combos through real-time 2D RPG combat or auto-battle mode. In addition to taking on Shadaloo, players can also look forward to head-to-head combat against other players.\n\n\n\"Street Fighter has been an iconic game for generations, and we know anime fans love to go on exciting adventures with beloved characters,\" Crunchyroll Games general manager and Crunchyroll senior vice president of emerging business Terry Li said in a press release. \"We're excited to collaborate with Capcom to bring Street Fighter: Duel and its incredible roster of iconic fighters to anime and gaming fans alike.\nPre-registration for both mobile platforms is available now through the official website. Those who pre-register will be gifted free in-game currency when the game arrives. Street Fighter: Duel is set to launch on iOS and Android in February.",

It came as a total surprise; Castlevania hasn’t had a new release in years, and most of Dead Cells’ other collaborations never amounted to much more than referential skins and a few weapons. To take such a big leap – and to do it with the series that inspired the game in the first place – is a huge step for the indie roguelike.\nWhile Dead Cells was developed by Motion twin, the Castlevania DLC is being developed by Evil Empire, an indie studio made of ex-Motion Twin employees that have handled most of the game’s post-launch content.

The game’s phenomenal blend of action and horror combined with its revolutionary over-the-shoulder gameplay cemented it as a bonafide classic, a magic Capcom hopes to recapture with a modernized remake. That reinvention graces Game Informer’s cover this month. \nWe visited Capcom’s headquarters in Osaka, Japan, to play Chapters One and Five of Resident Evil and speak to its principal designers, including directors Yasuhiro Ampo and Kazunori Kadoi, who previously led the Resident Evil 2 remake.

As previously promised, the wait is over because Marvel Snap’s new Battle Mode allows players to take on their buddies, and it goes live today.\nBattle Mode allows players to share battle codes with each other for private one-on-one bouts. This match-up consists of multiple back-to-back games with players using the same decks throughout. Players start with 10 health each and whoever wins a game deals 1 point of damage. However, this damage can be doubled by snapping. A player loses when their health hits zero, and there’s no round limit. Developer Second Dinner states that Battle Mode will receive updates expanding its features over the coming months. \nFor more on Marvel Snap, check out its spot on our Top 10 Games of 2022 to find out what makes it so special.

Maybe you’ll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long - otherwise, there are some demos of these games available on our website.\nAnd since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we’ve seen notable changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.\nAs usual, we are not just adding support for new games. We are constantly working on improving the engines we already support and, in particular, we’ve seen some incredible work being done on the SCUMM engine. Yes, there are the usual bug fixes, but this time we are also adding a feature that helps playing the SCUMM games in a truly original fashion: Support for the original loading and saving dialogs within the GUI!\nSpeaking of truly original: Remember those old CRT displays we had back in the day? With ScummVM 2.7.0 you’ll be able to replicate this experience on certain platforms thanks to our new shader-based scalers. Go ahead and give it a try!\nAll testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.\nA detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.\nThank you very much for your support!

          "description": "Breaking news: OpenTTD 13.0 is now available! Depending on your perspective, we’re either two months early for our usual April 1st release, or a bit tardy for the Christmas 2022 release we intended. We think the wait has been worth it. This is one of the largest releases we’ve done in several years, with numerous features and improvements covering the user interface, gameplay features, and modding extensions for NewGRF and Game Script creators. Some of the highlights are: Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. This includes better automatic scaling when using HiDPI or mixed DPI setups. Direct access to NewGRF/AI/GS settings from the new game window. Various small tweaks and improvements to several windows. NewGRFs can now provide engine variants that are shown hierarchically in the purchase list. Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. Custom league tables for GameScripts. More natural rivers which get wider as they flow downstream. And much more, which can be seen in the changelog or the previous release announcements! In addition to these features and improvements, we’ve fixed lots of bugs. (If you played with the RC2 testing release, most were fixed before then. See the changelog for full details.)
