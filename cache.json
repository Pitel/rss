Surely we haven't become worse at games with age? Well, maybe not.\nAs flagged on Twitter by @JupiterClimb, Dawn of Sorrow's secret 'Julius Mode' is now home to an added challenge in the final fight as the big bad's attacks aren't as easily evaded as they were back in 2005.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "A baby's gotta do what a baby's gotta do.\nThat Rugrats has somehow managed to remain in the public consciousness for so long is impressive in its own right. This is in part down to Nickelodeon continuing to screen it for younger generations, and that the show ran for 13 years across 172 episodes and spawned two feature films. The most important reason for its extended shelf life, though, is its unexpectedly broad appeal. Formulated by Hungarian-born Gábor Csupó and his wife, Arlene Klasky, Rugrats appeared to be a show about babies for babies, but it was actually a show about babies for children and adults. Thanks to clever writing and a deeper maturity — commonplace during the Simpsons-inspired '90s — those who loved it 30 years ago will still enjoy it today.\nRugrats: Adventures in Gameland’s most essential victory, then, isn’t necessarily its stage design or graphical style, but tapping into the show's intelligence. It's a shame the original voice cast is unavailable, with exchanges instead represented in text, but you can still recall Tommy’s raspy tones in your head.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The furore across the internet upon the announcement of the Marvel vs Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics, however, seemed to burn twice as bright.\nFeaturing seven titles, there’s nothing but gold across the board. It includes every pixel-drawn Marvel fighting game up to and including Marvel vs. Capcom 2, and all arcade originals. Capcom has ploughed the package with bonuses, from beautifully defined CRT filters and music players to original arcade art galleries, region switching, superb training modes, save states, and 4:3 screen bezels. For online play, Capcom's own rollback netcode is present and working fluidly. Although we can’t comment on how it will hold up when the servers go global, we’re optimistic it will be well maintained. You can hop in and out of matches, take on casual and ranked match-ups, and spectate freely. It’s quite the fighting festival, and buffed to a shine.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It wasn't that I fell out of love with the idea, just that I can't physically do it.\" That was then and this, thankfully, is now. Byrne has tentatively returned to the project and begun sharing screens on social media.\n Read more",

Ubiquitous wearable sci-fi shields repel any attack that comes in too fast, so everyone has to learn this unique, overtly dance-like form of close-quarters combat where every thrust and parry is necessarily slow and considered. Picture it: careful judgments of your movements, weighing up the right time to strike, every measured jab part of a wider strategy that culminates in the kill.\nMOBAs are like that. Both in the fights themselves, sort of, where probing lunges lead up to bursts of lethality, but more broadly in each match as a whole. They’re map-wide knife fights, where a thrust is a well-judged lane push and a parry a savvy item buy. At first, playing Smite 2 felt akin to watching on helplessly as my opponents repeatedly shoved their crysknives through my ribs. After 30 hours, it often still feels like that - but I am enjoying myself. Mostly. Despite Valve’s third-person elephant in the lane. \nRead more",

While approaches to 4X and grand strategy vary hugely between games, factions and players, the genre as a whole is firmly wedded to imperial conquest, both structurally and at the level of narrative aspects and set-dressing. Many 4X games are triumphal re-enactments of specific periods of colonial settlement and expansion. All of which is to say that Syphilisation is fascinating. It's a reworking of the genre which dismantles and reconstructs concepts such as diplomacy, research and production.

While it wasn't outstanding in the grander landscape of gaming, enough Warhammer 40K fans seem to have cherished the escapades of bulky blue boltgunner Demetrian Titus for the action game to merit a sequel a decade later. It left its story on something of a cliffhanger, with said hero being dragged away to face untold tortures by the Inquisition, the most zealous sect of this preternaturally paranoid sci-fi universe. Today, Titus is free again. Free to stomp towards hordes of alien foes, blast them with a plasma incinerator, and shred the stragglers with a chainsaw sword. Space Marine 2 is an often-satisfying scrapper that has me  convinced of 40K's merit as a crafting ground for excellent-looking environments and creatures, even if I'm not particularly moved by the bland character of Titus and his fellow Ultramarines.\nRead more",

          "description": "In the first post for my series on \"saving\" open world design, I complained that many of today's open worlds feel like checklists of formulaic tasks and rewards, their geography a vaporous staging ground for itemisable, cycling content-gathering opportunities, which flies in the face of the sense of freedom and wonder they're supposed to inspire. My interviewees, Elder Scrolls veterans Matt Firor and Nate Purkeypile, argued that this reflects the expense and scale of today's open world productions, which constrains experimental design both at a practical level and in terms of overall direction.\nCD Projekt open world designer Jakub Tomczak doesn't, as far as I know, have an answer to the issue of production bloat, but he does have a disarmingly obvious solution to the 'checklist problem', based on his time creating missions for Cyberpunk 2077 and its Phantom Liberty expansion: get better at hiding the checklist. Weave it into the landscape and setting more artfully, with an elegant balance of randomisation and responsiveness to the player's behaviour which keeps everything fresh. \r\n\n \nRead more",

It was a copy of The Game of Life, possibly the least exciting board game a child can win.\nThe game was dog water, and there’s probably a lesson in there somewhere about how cool and good it is to whine until you get free things, but we don’t have time for that.

The game was a bright spot in a bad time, which might seem peculiar given that Sluggish Morss often looks like a whale's upset stomach, but it's such a feverishly inventive creation. It blew the dust from my synapses.\nThe same appears true of King-Spooner's upcoming Judero, on which he is collaborating with Soul Searching developer Talha Kaya. It casts you as a \"pagan seer\" armed with a big stick, who is searching the mythical Scottish borderlands for evil creatures to clobber. It looks cheerier and airier than Sluggish Morss, with a more overt emphasis on mechanics such as combat, but it has the same pickled 3am energy to it.

Straight away, the animation and noise indicators evoke the same Shadow Tactics or Desperados III goodness you’re probably expecting. Fine with me - that’s exactly what I’m here for.

It’s one of those weirder subcultures you read about in the papers, but rarely observe in daily life. \r\n\n\r\nI do, however, understand the appeal of same-screen co-op games like Run From Mummies - which, being a bloodless comedy dungeon romp, seems like a fair pick for those encumbered with boisterous selfspawn. Don’t worry, the “mummies” of the title are just regular old disembowelled corpses wrapped in cloth, not those sinister, non-embalmed “mothers” you’ve been hearing about down the grocers.\r\n\n \nRead more",

As several of you identified, this seemed like an odd comparison when Spice Maureen 2 specifically plans to charge for comparable cosmetics, although I imagine Willits was referencing the “packs” that his space game’s baubles come in. “Our fans never thought we ripped them off in World War Z,” he said, comparing Space Marine 2’s optional spendables to that game.\nWhether you see the cosmetic's pricing as egregious or not, yesterday’s roadmap does look to make good on Saber’s promise to keep wearables and playables separate.

He's there, barely camouflaged, in the undergrowth of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater - a remake of the fifth Metal Gear game, originally released in 2004, which tells the tale of a lone US special operator hunting superweapons and old mentors in the jungles of the southern Soviet Union. \r\n\n\r\nI say \"remake\" but this feels more like a re-release, in spirit. True, it now runs on Unreal Engine, with the option of a manual, third-person perspective and cover-shooter controls in addition to the old top-down viewpoints. Yes, it boasts new flourishes, such as wounds now leaving scars, and clothes picking up stray leaves. Yes, there's a new interface with floating in-world menus, which makes shuffling between the layers a bit less awkward. It's the product of much labour, with development split between Konami and external support partner Virtuos. But where Konami's other big restoration project, Bloober's Silent Hill 2 remake, is a creative dialogue with the original game, Delta seems consumed by faithfulness to Kojima's original design.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's also a free-to-play game, and I have the usual unanswered questions about currencies and gacha, but I'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt for the minute, because I have not spent nearly enough of my life considering the tactical applications of ballgowns.

          "description": "If you’re planning on refining a melee build in Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2, you may see that there are three defense types such as block, balance, and fencing. \n\n\nThe former two are straightforward, so what is fencing? We’ll break this down below and compare it between the other two types.\n\n\nWhat is fencing in Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2?\n\n\nFencing is a defense type on melee weapons that is primarily focused on performing parries. This is one of the stronger options if you’re trying to maintain your health and armor upkeep. \n\n\nIt requires better timing when you see a blue enemy circle indicating they’re about to attack. In other cases, you can still parry attacks that don’t appear with the indicator as long as it isn’t the lethal red one.\n\n\nFencing compared to block and balance\n\n\nFencing is a high-risk, high-reward playstyle compared to the other two defense types. Your timing has to be good. Otherwise, you’ll suffer a lot of damage and possibly go down, especially with higher difficulties.\n\n\nWith balance, you can play defensively or use parrying. This is if you want to still parry but also block if you get overrun or you’re still practicing on your timing.\n\n\nLastly, the block defense type lives up to its name. It focuses on blocking attacks and having massive damage reduction over performing reversals. If your timing is bad or you are going to rely on other players to take out big, this is going to be more up your alley.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nIs fencing the best defense type?\n\n\nTechnically, this would be the best type, but it’s dependent on your skill. Performing a parry means that you’ll be performing finisher attacks more often on enemies. \n\n\nDuring these finisher animations on enemies, you’re completely invulnerable. So, performing these back-to-back will make you even more tanky and an excellent bait for other players to take out high-priority targets like Majoris and Extremis-level enemies.\n\nThe post What is fencing in Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2? appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "After six years of Cursed Spirits slaying, the Jujutsu Kaisen manga is almost on its way out with its final arc. It'll finally determine the fate of the beloved Jujutsu Sorcerors, an ensemble that has endured many trials and tribulations since the start. We'll show you when to expect Jujutsu Kaisen's manga ending to prepare you for its conclusion.\n\n\nJujutsu Kaisen manga end date\n\n\nJJK creator Gege Akutami first announced the manga's ending, marking its conclusion after a select few chapters. The saga's official page also confirmed a more precise date: Sept. 30, 2024. That means Chapter 271 will be the last of the series, tying into the Shinjuku Showdown arc.\n\n\nYou can look forward to the remaining chapters, which will debut every Sunday until the end of September. They can typically be read for free on Viz Media or Manga Plus, featuring other recent storylines.\n\n\nImage via MAPPA\n\n\nAs for what we can expect from Jujutsu Kaisen's manga ending, it could go down in plenty of ways. I won't go into too much about what's been happening in the manga to avoid any spoilers, but I will say that it does correlate with the main objective of bringing the infamous Sukuna down. Whatever the case may be for the manga, the conclusion will undoubtedly explain what happens to the Jujutsu Sorcerers or even include one more battle just for kicks.\n\n\nFortunately, the JJK adventures have yet to conclude with the promise of new episodes. While not much is known about Season 3, we can remain hopeful for more details in the coming months. There's still a lot to dig into with the anime's current place in the timeline, which may cover the entirety of its following season. Given the success of Jujutsu Kaisen 0, there's a good chance we might see the show's ending as a film instead. We'll possibly get more information about this once the manga concludes. \n\nThe post When will the Jujutsu Kaisen manga end? appeared first on Destructoid.",

First and foremost, you'll want the Soul Eater Ring. The problem is that it's not available until the later half of the game. Worse still, it's prohibitively expensive at 300,000g. But once you acquire it, it doubles the rate at which enemies drop their souls when you defeat them.\n\n\nThe best way to get a particular soul is find a place whe…",

Hopefully, you meet the Metaphor: ReFantazio PC system requirements to make this game look glorious on your monitor or TV.\n\n\nMetaphor: ReFantazio PC system requirements - minimum specs\n\n\nTo run Metaphor: Fantazio at 720p resolution with 30 frames per second (FPS), you'll need the following specs, according to the game's Steam listing:\n\n\n\nOS: Windows 10\n\n\nProcessor: Intel Core i5-3470 or AMD FX-6300\n\n\nMemory: 6 GB RAM\n\n\nGraphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 750 Ti, 4GB or AMD Radeon R7 360, 4GB or Intel Arc A310, 4GB\n\n\nDirectX: Version 11\n\n\nStorage: 93 GB available space\n\n\n\nThe game's developer Atlus and the publisher Sega also say that you require a CPU with AVX support. You can check if your Intel processor has this functionality by looking up the Instruction Set Extensions from the CPU Technologies tab in the Intel Processor Identification Utility app. Most modern computers should have AVX support.\n\n\nImage via Atlus\n\n\nMetaphor: ReFantazio is fairly beefy with 93GB of storage being taken. However, it's smaller than other RPGs like Starfield or Final Fantasy XVI.\n\n\nRecommended specs for Metaphor: ReFantazio\n\n\nIf you want this gorgeous Atlus game to run with 1080p resolution at 60 FPS, you'll need the following:\n\n\n\nOS: Windows 10\n\n\nProcessor: Intel Core i5-7600 or Ryzen 5 2600\n\n\nMemory: 8 GB RAM\n\n\nGraphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970, 4GB or AMD Radeon RX 480, 4GB or Intel Arc A380, 6GB\n\n\nDirectX: Version 11\n\n\nStorage: 93 GB available space\n\n\n\nYou'll want to at least match the recommended specs for this game because our preview said \"It might be one of the most stylish games [..] in some time.\"\n\nThe post Metaphor: ReFantazio PC system requirements – minimum and recommended appeared first on Destructoid.",
