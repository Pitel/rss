And Taito has today revealed the next new entry, coming exclusively to Switch in 2023.\nPuzzle Bobble Everybubble! doesn't just come with an adorable title — it also looks utterly adorable, too! After teasing the game last year, Taito has revealed that Bub and Bob are back along with two other tiny dragons — Peb and Pab — and all four of them are ready to burst bubbles throughout the Rainbow Islands.

          "description": "\"Most of the staff have moved on to other companies\".\nThere's nothing quite like Chibi-Robo. The teeny, tiny little robot came out late in the GameCube's lifespan in the west and never really got the love he deserved. We never forgot about him at least, but it's been a quiet few years since developer Skip Ltd and Chibi-Robo have plugged into adventure, despite the game getting a few DS and 3DS follow-ups.\nAnd it seems like there might be a reason for that. In an exclusive interview with our shiny new sister site Time Extension, Chibi-Robo's director Kenichi Nishi talks about how the game came to be on Nintendo's little purple box, and how Miyamoto managed to help keep the project alive. But, near the end of the interview, the director admits that many of the original staff who worked on the series are no longer at Skip:\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Personal space.\nI Was a Teenage Exocolonist, the latest game from indie publisher Finji, developed by Northway Games, is a nice game. It looks nice, sounds nice, features nice characters being nice to one another, and is so nice to the player that you’ll breeze right through it – for better or worse. This is a game where the sheer word count and richness of presentation are a feat to behold, outstripping any text-based story game we’ve played in a long time. Nintendo Life’s interview with developer Sarah Northway following the release of the Steam demo gave a hint of the passion driving the game, and playing it on Switch certainly bears that out.\nAt its heart, Exocolonist is a piece of interactive fiction in the most traditional, choose-your-own-adventure, Twine-game style. The bulk of the story experience consists of reading concise flavour text, then picking an option for how your character acts. This is ornamented neatly with lightweight third-person exploration and an enjoyable card game mechanic, allowing a breather from the text and keeping momentum up.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The influence of Rare's seminal shooter on the FPS genre and console video gaming in general is enormous, and gamers have now been poring over it and picking apart its secrets for the last two-and-a-half decades. It stands as a monolith in the gaming landscape, an artifact that's spawned endless investigation, discussion, and debate. What is there left to say?\nWell, while we're all on tenterhooks waiting for an official announcement of the long-rumoured remaster — an announcement that seems to have been rumoured at every major video gaming event for the past year — we thought we'd look back on the game's 25th anniversary with 25 facts you may or may not know, or at the very least might have forgotten! As we mentioned above, this is one of the most discussed video games ever made, with a bunker-full of retrospective articles, historical deep-dives, developer postmortems, and even documentary movies to its name, so forgive us if you're a veteran who does know some of the nuggets we've picked out below.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "\"You're not being the ball, Danny\".\nHalloween might still be a couple months away, but Chuhai Labs has seen fit to kick off the spooky season early with its latest release, Cursed to Golf. Starring a person who basically escapes from hell using nothing but their god-tier golf skills, it’s certainly a memorable adventure and we’re happy to say that it’s actually a pretty solid golf game. There are some relatively minor flaws here and there, but the quality of its excellent gameplay means that Cursed to Golf generally shows itself to be up to par.\nCursed to Golf places you in the role of a professional golfer who, at the start of the narrative, is a very alive person about to claim victory in a world-renowned golf tournament. As you close in on the end of the round, a thunderstorm rolls in, but your character will not be deterred from seizing their destiny. Unfortunately, this turns out to be a poor decision, as you’re soon struck by lightning and subsequently killed. Your golfer’s soul is sent to a sort of golfing purgatory, where you’re then greeted by the ghost of a golfer Scotsman who says you need to clear 18 holes on a spooky, ever-shifting course to ascend back to the world. The problem is that nobody has actually done it before, but that isn’t going to stop you from trying as many times as it takes to get back to your body and finish your tournament.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Even its music is reminiscent of some lost, unknown childhood as we’re lulled into the strange world of U-Chronia with the smooth instrumentation of a single guitar and its occasional percussion. Yet it’s clear with the presence of beasts that threaten your safety and a shadowy clone that this isn’t some peaceful retreat into childhood.\nRead more",

Not Age Of Empires II this time, though. \nBecause there's no Matthew, I change the Cavern Of Lies into a cavern of moral judgement for Nate, and make him run a gauntlet of some of the most important choices in Dragon Age Inquisition with no context.

          "description": "\"The thing we're doing with The Dark Pictures is exploring different sub genres of horror,\" explains game director Tom Heaton. The Dark Pictures Anthology is, well, a horror anthology, each a compact standalone scary game where you explore and deal with QTEs and hazardous choices, in the vein of Supermassive's smash hit Until Dawn. The idea, says Heaton, is that each one takes one or two horror sub-genres and mines them, maybe subverting the tropes here and there. Up next is The Devil In Me, inspired by the infamous Chicago serial killer H. H. Holmes. \n\"What I think we decided with The Dark Pictures games early on was that the next game in the series would be very different from the last game, because we want to keep it fresh, we want to give the audience new,\" Heaton explains. So, after a zombie ghost ship in Man Of Medan, the psychological witch hauntings in Little Hope, and military squad vs. vampire aliens in House Of Ashes, Heaton pitches The Devil In Me as kind of Saw meets The Shining. It's a serial killer slasher in a weirdo hotel, and it has a true crime element. And I have to say, it's probably the most excited I've been for a Dark Pictures entry.\nRead more",

I thought there’d be more imposing planetary locales to navigate in this sequel to Deliver Us The Moon, and there are, but I wasn’t prepared for a whole bunch of astronauts running about being dramatic.

There are people who love doing the management bits - the bean-counting, optimising the amount of salt on fries to make people thirsty and buy more drinks, paying close attention to demographics and average spends and that sort of kidney*. Then there are people who want to design a park full of cool-ass rides and different themed zones, a true magical wonderland. Inside this Park Beyond are two wolves, in other words, and each needs a different but equally robust set of tools to wrangle.\nAfter some hands on with an early build of Park Beyond, I have a little more faith that Limbic Entertainment are going to be able to pull it off. The toolset for building a rollercoast is, in particular, impressive. It's never been so easy to make a ride that breaks both the laws of physics and the laws of health and saftey. The coasters in this game are an absolute menace. In a good way.\nRead more",

Both of you occasionally interject, sometimes prompting a decision that changes the game a little as your granddad amends things to your liking. It doesn't go to the full meta-narrative lengths of a Juarez Gunslinger with it, but it's a cute touch and keeps the framing relevant.\nRead more",

Beyond that, I'm not sure I can say anything. Developers Build A Rocket Boy describe it as \"an original multi-world experience\" that \"will blend gameplay, adventure, creativity, and discovery in a space that blurs the line between reality and the digital world\".\nSo it will probably be either like Roblox or like Second Life, then? Hopefully we'll get a greater sense of which by the time it's out, which will be in 2023. The teaser trailer is a montage of stuff happening quickly in the shape of the logo.\nRead more",

Just, your best guess, or the squid'll getcha with its weird alien ink. Ready? Go!.... Okay, well congratulations to anyone who said \"a turn-based strategy game inspired by tabletop miniatures\". Unlikely as it may seem you were right, and everyone else was wrong. It's called Moonbreaker and it's hitting early access on September 29. And Brandon Sanderson is at this party, too.\nI admit it was a trick question, but look, I'm a genuinely big fan of devs doing a completely different project after a successful game. I also know a whole lotta people who love painting plastic fighters in cool colours, carefuly placing them on a tabletop, and slowly pushing them into other plastic fighters in different colours. I'm absolutely sure that Unknown Worlds will make a very good version of a digital tabletop strategy game. I must admit, though, that whenever a video game like this emerges, I sort of wonder why tabletop-thusiasts would buy it instead of more actual miniatures.\nRead more",

For LGBTQ+ people - and trans people in particular - the increasingly extreme rhetoric and legislation being weaponised against these communities can feel all-consuming. Yet it comes at a time when diverse representation in media, including games, is improving. As the number of characters stated to LGBTQ+ grows, what is more effective representation: making it possible to see your own experiences on screen, or make those experiences understandable to someone who isn't LGBTQ+?\r\n\n\r\nPeople who know of it would perhaps cite the work of developer and translator npckc, who I recently spoke with at the recent Japanese indie gaming event Bitsummit. They were there to showcase their latest game A Pet Shop After Dark, a departure from visual novels like A Year Of Springs trilogy into horror storytelling (\"more spooky than outright horror,\" as they later clarified) that's set to release later this month. Beyond the trilogy and their newest work, they’ve translated the works of other developers and worked on other smaller games and game jam projects.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "The last year or so of Elite Dangerous has been the most dramatic since the game launched in 2014. The most recent update to Frontier Developments' epic space sim, Update 13, saw the conclusion of the story's Azimuth Saga, culminating in a disastrous attempt to stop the incursion of the Thargoids – Elite's hostile race of insectoid aliens. It's an event that has already had a major impact on Elite's universe, and Frontier are excited to discuss the studio's plans for the game and its narrative as it pushes into a new phase for the galaxy, simply known as \"Aftermath\".\nBut the drama surrounding Elite Dangerous isn't limited to the game's overarching story. As I gear up to chat with lead game designer Luke Betterton and senior producer Samantha Marsh, the Thargoid in the room is Elite Dangerous: Odyssey. Launched in May last year, Elite's second expansion was, to put it lightly, not well received by Elite's community. Complaints ranged from extensive bugs and performance issues to more fundamental criticisms about the implementation of the expansion's on-foot exploration and FPS combat. Over a year on from release, the expansion still carries a \"Mostly Negative\" rating on Steam, standing in stark contrast to reviews for vanilla Elite Dangerous (now bundled with its Horizons expansion), which remain firmly positive.\nRead more",

Like being upgraded to business class at the airport, if Lufthansa suddenly discovered they had a few more planes than they thought.\nRead more",

While Deep Silver Volition’s “what if millennials, but crime” reboot is colourful and often quite pretty, you can tell it’s not nearly as interested in cutting edge visuals or contemporary PC tech trappings as the Spidey remaster is. Ray tracing? Yes but only for ambient occlusion. Upscaling? Never heard of it, officer.\nThe upside - besides Santo Ileso being a generally nice place to visit, as Alice Bee found in her Saints Row review - is that it's playable on low-end and luxury hardware alike. And, to its credit, there's a healthy list of customisable graphics options too. I’ve therefore embraced the past, and spent hours in testing to find out how you can tweak Saints Row’s settings for the best possible performance. \nRead more",

          "description": "There’s a long-standing theory among the Warhammer community that the chaos wastes at the globe’s south pole house a peculiar breed of beastmen in the form of evil, monstrous penguins. The theory is based on a world with similar geography to our own, and the tendency of the ruinous powers to morph local fauna into mockeries of their previous forms. No ping-gors show themselves as I trawl the southern wastes as stealthy chameleon-skink Oxyotl, but I find myself thinking about them all the same. Noot for the noot god, the blasted crags seem to whisper. Fish for the fish throne.\nEvil penguins or not, all things seem possible with Immortal Empires, the combined landmass of the Total War: Warhammer trilogy into a single sandbox map, vast and varied in its climates, landmarks, and inhabitants. Creative Assembly have already dug deep into dusty stacks of White Dwarf to flesh out footnotes into full factions, and as the list of obvious additions dwindle, things can only get wilder and more creative. For now, we have one very big map stuffed with each faction and lord from three massive strategy games, creaking and occasionally buckling under the weight of its own promise. But it works. There’s a breadth of technical and balance issues still to solve, but the Immortal Empires beta is substantially more stable, playable, and enjoyable than I dared to hope it would be for at least another six months.\nRead more",

It quickly diverged to become less realistic and more impossibly bombastic, and niched down into giant dildo bats, aliens, reincarnation, and so on. The series has gone to outer space and to hell, so if you're rebooting the series that doesn't leave you many places to go except... backwards.\nSaints Row (2022 edition) is back to being a sort of Saints Row again, but also still trying to appeal to people who loved the characters and dick jokes and cartoon carnage of the Saints Row of 2013. If I was being reductive, I'd say it's Saints Row by way of Watch Dogs 2. It isn't bad. It's fun, in fact, but it isn't really doing anything new, either, and I think that's a shame.\nRead more",

Well, I went back and counted, folks, and it's not great reading. At time of writing, just over half that number - 27 in total - are still slated for a 2022 release right now, although with many still listed as a very vague '2022' or 'Coming Soon' on their Steam pages, I wouldn't be surprised if that number fell further. Needless to say, I'm not sure 2022 will go down as one of the great gaming years... 2023, on the other hand? Wow, that's looking rad.\nRead more",

          "description": "Galactic alliances aren’t built in a day, a month or even a year, to warp a comfortingly familiar phrase from 90s telly. Interplanetary 4X Stellaris has been evolving for more than six years now, having first released on May 9th 2016. Unusually, I remember exactly when I bought the game, because it was in the days just before my partner and I welcomed our first child. Being a ginormous sci-fi nerd, I enthusiastically downloaded it thinking I’d have all the space-time in the universe to invest in building my own interstellar superpower.\nI did dip my toes in back then, and have many, many times since, but rather naively didn’t foresee the inevitable. The structure of my life altered dramatically with the arrival of our baby. It didn’t stop there either, and still hasn’t, taking on some unfamiliar but just about recognisable form every few months. I suspect the developers of Stellaris had a similar feeling following the game’s release into the wider universe, like Kubrick’s giant cosmic infant at the end of 2001: A Space Odyssey. I know I’ve felt like my furniture’s been rearranged whenever I’ve started a new game of Stellaris with a different civilisation over the intervening years.\nRead more",

I've spent some time with the game's early levels and it perfectly captures what I'd consider to be a 'classical' Soulslike: a game that's heavily focused on The Combat Bit above all else.\nDoes the game's combat rule? Yes, without a doubt. But will I continue playing? I'm not so sure. From what I've sampled, one strong pillar might not be enough to hold my attention for much longer.\nRead more",

From their beginnings on the fairway fringes of Flash-game forums, we now have been blessed with a handful of fun indie golf sims. We’ve seen the bizarre buffoonery of What The Golf?, the high-speed, eye-popping courses of Golf With Your Friends, and Secret Mode recently completely threw the clubs out the window and replaced them with highspeed motorcars in Turbo Golf Racing.\nIt's safe to say that golfing games are always full of shenanigans and Cursed To Golf is no different. Playing as a golfer who has been cast into Golf Purgatory, you need to golf your way back to the land of the living, completing all eighteen holes in one roguelike run. It’s a fun premise and the game bursts with silliness and personality, but unfortunately Cursed To Golf fails to iron out certain roguelike frustrations. After mistiming a shot in the game’s final area and being sent back to the beginning (ending an excruciating four-hour run time), I truly did feel cursed.\nRead more",

          "description": "Sing-a-Song of Slugfests\nMuch like another of WayForward's top franchises, Shantae, River City Girls understands that the key to connecting with an audience is to imbue your characters and worlds with life, personality, and charisma. This can be achieved through storytelling, script, visuals, and, of course, music. For Kyoko, Misako, their allies, and their enemies, music plays an essential part in setting the scene, with pulse-pounding beats, retro-electro, and dramatic vocals scoring the duo's fast 'n' furious town tear-up.\nRiver City Girls' distinct sound was meticulously composed by Washington-based musician Megan McDuffee. McDuffee's work brings life and dynamism to RCG, affording its 2D visuals fullness of character, springing the game's heroes, villains, and locales to life. Now pre…",

But it wasn't! Here's how to quickly get through the Genshin Impact courtyard \"far down the corridor\" quest.\n[There are no story spoilers present below outside of the puzzle solution.]\n\nWalk up to the marked quest area, and line up the symbols to get through the Genshin Impact courtyard\nA few hours into the Genshin Impact 3.0 Archon (main story) questline, you'll encounter a section that warps you away to another area. This is all part of the Through Mists of Smoke and Forests Dark portion of Chapter III, at which point you'll encounter the \"Silent Seeker of Knowledge\" step.\nAfter jumping through a series of light platforming puzzles, you'll encounter the aforementioned \"courtyard far down the corridor.\" The thing is you're not really investigating in the courtyard per se, but in the general area. You can't go over the ledge, so step into the spot in the above image, and position your camera so that the two symbols in the background line up. The screen will change hue and doors will open on your left, allowing you to continue the quest.\n\nIt seems so simple, but sometimes not everything works out as nicely as it should. When I arrived in this area, the light indicating where I should investigate the courtyard didn't show up. Subsequently, I tried to actually get into the courtyard and thought it was bugged. But I've been through enough action-platformers to eventually figure out the classic \"line up the symbols with the camera\" trick. And now you have too!\nThe post How to investigate the courtyard far down the corridor in Genshin Impact appeared first on Destructoid.",

And from wild powers to melee weapons and guns, it looks like you'll have a pretty fun arsenal to play with in this game.\nDeveloper Mundfish released this trailer today, spotlighting how the player can fight against hordes of mechanized combatants. They look pretty dangerous, from the regular automated grunts to giant bosses.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbIc2_FwReE\nAtomic Heart is set in a future where a failure at a Soviet facility has led to a machine uprising. As Major P-3, you have to go in, minimize consequences, and prevent critical info from leaking.\nYou'll need weapons though, to deal with all the angry robots. And it looks like you get a pretty decent variety of them. Atomic Heart is absolutely giving me BioShock vibes, in a very good way. Freezing enemies and lifting them into the air with your power-charged glove, then battering them with a makeshift melee weapon looks like a blast.\nAtomic punk\nWe've been seeing bits and pieces of Atomic Heart over the last few years, as Mundfish has continued to work away on the project. We've seen combat, exploration, story, and even one very unsettling clown enemy. Not looking forward to that fight in particular.\nIt's a game that's continued to impress me a little more each time I see new footage. And from what we saw today, it really does seem like Atomic Heart is coming together well.\nThe question at this point is, when will it launch? Mundfish published the trailer today, alongside a tweet that says it will launch on console and PC in late 2022.\nIt looks like this holiday season might see us freezing, smashing, and bashing robots in this retro-future universe.\nThe post Atomic Heart shows off more of its combat in new trailer appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's actually super useful, as the gameplay is simplistic enough to literally watch this video, then dive in. This is going to be especially useful for the upcoming Splatfest demo, as some folks may have not played the series up through this point.\nCoincidentally, you'll also get a ton of new footage for Splatoon 3. None of it is revelatory per se, but people who are really looking at every single detail until release might want to check it out, as there's a lot of environmental showcasing going on.

The consumer shelf cost for the powerful console will increase in select territories, including Europe, Japan, and Canada.\nThe news was announced in a new blog post by SIE's Jim Ryan, wherein the President & CEO cited the \"Global economic environment\" as the key reason behind the price rise.\n\"The global economic environment is a challenge that many of you around the world are no doubt experiencing,\" wrote Ryan. \"We’re seeing high global inflation rates, as well as adverse currency trends, impacting consumers and creating pressure on many industries. Based on these challenging economic conditions, SIE has made the difficult decision to increase the recommended retail price of PlayStation 5 in select markets across Europe, Middle East, and Africa, Asia-Pacific, Latin America, as well as Canada. There will be no price increase in the United States.\"\nThe new PS5 console prices in these districts are as follows:\nEurope: (around €50 rise)\nUK: (around £30 GBP rise)\nJapan: (around ¥5,000 rise)\nChina: (around 400RMB rise)\nAustralia: (around $50 AUD rise)\nMexico: (around 1,000 pesos rise)\nCanada: (around $20 CAD rise)\nIndustry analysts have already shared their thoughts on SIE's decision, noting that, due to the general scarcity of hardware, slowed production cycle and the global cost of living crisis, it is unlikely that the price rise will have much of a negative effect on either the overall sales of PS5 hardware, or Sony's target sales for the remainder of the fiscal year. With its own new hardware, Xbox Series X/S, already retailing at a cheaper price than the PS5 platform, Microsoft's response to this move will be an interesting one.\nThe post Sony announces PS5 price rise for select global territories appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Keep these highly specific animal games coming\nWhether you think raccoons are adorable little scamps or an utter nuisance, Snaccoon is worth a look — it's a game about securing snacks as a raccoon. Relatable, right?\nGame developer Christian Sparks shared a trailer for Snaccoon during today's Future Games Show live stream. With so many familiar-looking games, this stood out to me. The concept immediately clicked with me, and it's not one I'll forget about anytime soon.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyLhxdL6918\nStrolling through town, hopping on trash cans, sneaking through vents, and scurrying off with someone's phone while it captures the theft — it's light and cute so far. I chuckled.\nBased on behind-the-scenes developer posts, expect a \"guided platforming\" system to keep traversal flowing while still giving you, the player, autonomy. Admittedly, the game's website is sparse right now (and there isn't a Steam page to point you to yet), but Sparks has some in-depth blogs to check out, including clips not shown in the trailer.\nExpectations for video games built around animal antics are high in a post-Stray world.\nThat said, there's a lower-stakes sense of playfulness here that I really like. A memorable concept can take a game pretty far, particularly if it's released at the right time and at a reasonable price. No word on when Snaccoon will be out other than it's \"coming soon.\"\nThe post Snaccoon is a sneaky exploration game starring a mischievous raccoon appeared first on Destructoid.",

While to many it feels like the game didn't come out all that long ago, BioShock was actually released August 21, 2007 — exactly fifteen years ago from this past Sunday, and we're celebrating the anniversary.\nThe whole BioShock series got a remaster and rerelease as a collection back in 2016, and when I replayed the games on my PS4, I was shocked at how well they've aged.

If you were interested by what you saw, Bungie has a new Destiny 2 lore video to help fill you in on the basics.\nThis video, dubbed \"Destiny 2: The Light and Darkness Saga - Destiny Calls,\" is short and sweet. It essentially covers all the bases, from the origins of the Traveler to different enemy factions that Guardians fight against.\nAt just about five minutes and change, this video lays out the foundation of Destiny 2 lore.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om28A9hTST0\nWhile it doesn't go into too many specifics with regards to campaign stories, it's a nice summation of Destiny 2 lore for folks looking to hop in and play right away. There's the Light, the Darkness, a bunch of angry enemy armies, and a whole lot of loot to pick up.\nThe battle for the Light\nIt's extra helpful, seeing as Destiny 2 is making all of its campaigns free to play this week, as part of the showcase festivities. If you were waiting to see what all the fuss is about, this is a good start to catching up.\nBungie revealed Destiny 2: Lightfall yesterday, confirming that the Guardians are indeed heading to Neptune. The neon city of Neomuna looks very cyberpunk, and while there, Guardians will pick up the ability to swing around using Strand powers. I think that makes it a strand game?\nAlongside some quality-of-life features that should make life easier, Bungie also confirmed a big plus for Destiny 2 newcomers. The studio says it won't sunset future Destiny 2 expansions like it did with the Forsaken campaign. This should hopefully make it even easier to hop on and catch up with the most recent Destiny 2 lore yourself.\nDestiny 2: Lightfall goes live on February 28, 2023.\nThe post Bungie’s new animated Destiny 2 lore video sums up the basics for newcomers appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Cozy up with this relaxing village-building game on Switch starting September 29\nI don't associate my PC or office space in general with \"cozy vibes\" — not now, and probably not ever. So it's wonderful to hear that Dorfromantik, a minimalistic village-building game that's out now on Steam, is coming to Nintendo Switch on September 29. In terms of low-stakes, just-let-me-unwind gaming, I can't think of a better platform.\nThis news got buried in yesterday's Gamescom deluge, but it's worth highlighting today.\nhttps://twitter.com/_Toukana/status/1562216676057354240\nDorfromantik is a game about building out a landscape by placing down randomly-drawn tiles — trees, houses, railroads, rivers — which connect in aesthetically pleasing ways. You'll start small, piece by piece, but end up with a pleasant-looking land that streches far.\nWhile it's possible to play aimlessly, if you're looking for more concrete goals, there are scores to chase, and achievements to work toward. There is a way to play strategically rather than just going with the flow. Zoey's got a good breakdown in her PC review.\nSpeaking of which, PC players will be getting controller support in an update, presumably around the same time as the Nintendo Switch release of Dorfromantik.\nSurprisingly, Dorfromantik is the first game from Toukana Interactive. With the way things seem to be going, I'm hoping the developers can take this success and run with it. In the shorter term, maybe that means more ports, potentially PlayStation, Xbox, iOS, and Android. Further out, though, I'd love to see where these game design concepts can go.\nThe post Dorfromantik is a perfect fit for Nintendo Switch appeared first on Destructoid.",

Currently in development for PC & consoles at its original studio Dimps, the 2D anime fighter is expected to arrive, (alongside its predecessor), at the tail-end of 2022.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-K_j6U_pCk\nAs you can see from the trailer, originally hosted by Japanese outlet 4gamer, The Rumble Fish 2 is hardly the most subtle of fighters, with bold, lurid visuals, over-the-top characters and movesets, and boasting a literal cacophony of vulgar, almost indistinct noise to soundtrack its hard-hitting action. Originally released to Japanese arcades in 2005, The Rumble Fish 2 would barely see light outside of its native Japan, which makes 3goo's incoming rereleases something of a special occasion for fighting game fans.\nThe two titles are set in a dystopian take on our own world, rendered asunder by corporate capitalism run amok. The series is typified by its goofy sense of humor, anarchic tone, and distinct \"S.M.A.\" (Smooth Model Animation) visual style. In a post-Garou world, The Rumble Fish was the last hurrah for good-looking, technically proficient 2D fighting games, before developers would decide that 3D was the way forward for all of the major brawling-based IPs.\nThe Rumble Fish and The Rumble Fish 2 are currently in development for PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

Rabbit & Bear Studios put out a new Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes trailer today, as part of Gamescom, and the RPG still looks fantastic.\nEiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes is the Kickstarter-backed successor to the Suikoden series, from members of the original Suikoden team. While we've seen some small slices of gameplay, we get a bit more in today's trailer.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdnPIkvUigw\nIt's impressive how this does manage to look HD-2D, but still has a distinct style of it. The world of Hundred Heroes looks gorgeous, and I'm particularly keen on the battle animations. The camera pans and zooms are great, and I love seeing the big party lineup all on one screen.\nAn untold future\nWhile we still haven't glimpsed any footage that contains straight-up fights with a UI and everything, hopefully we'll get some more soon. At the end of today's trailer, Rabbit & Bear confirms that more news is scheduled for Tokyo Game Show. TGS 2022 runs from September 15 through 18, just a few weeks from now.\n\nThe prequel action RPG Eiyuden Chronicle: Rising already left a good impression on those who played it. You can even spot a party member from Rising, a certain sword-wielding kangaroo, in the battle at one point. And a shark fighter too? Looks like we'll get some wild characters to recruit into our massive party.\nEverything we've seen so far of Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes looks quite promising. Here's hoping the studio can deliver. Last time we heard about an estimated launch, the RPG was pushed into 2023.

Let's take a look at what the Nintendo Splatoon 3 Harvestella stream entails.\nSplatoon 3 stream\nThis is going to be the main event, and will actually feature two different Splatoon 3 segments. The first is a \"deep-drive into the all new single-player mode,\" which will hopefully give us a good look at some of the level designs for the campaign. While multiplayer is typically the focus for Splatoon games, there's a lot of potential with campaigns, and I'm anxious to see if this levels-up things at all.\nThe next part of the Splatoon 3 stream is \"stages and strategies for the Splatfest World Premiere demo.\" This one is more self-explanatory, and will of course deal with multiplayer mechanics for the Splatfest demo set to debut on August 27.\nHarvestella stream\nFinally, and it's vague at the moment, but we're getting a \"world-first gameplay\" stream for Harvestella. People seem really stoked on this one, and although splitting streams between different games is always a gamble, I'm willing to bet a lot of people will tune in (either during or afterward with the VOD) for a look at this one.\nWhen the stream airs, you'll be able to find it here.\nThe post Nintendo will be streaming Splatoon 3 and Harvestella this week appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's a historical thriller, an adventure told in another era using art, sounds, and design conducive to the overall feeling of life in 16th century upper Bavaria.\nIt's no surprise, then, that this is a passion project for the developers at Obsidian putting it together. We got a chance to take a look at some of Pentiment ahead of Gamescom and participate in a Q&A with some developers behind the project.

Both titles will then be rendered unpurchasable, though owners will still be able to redownload and play the games as they wish.\nSpeaking in a brief statement on Twitter, Slightly Mad Studios pointed to the expiration of various in-game licenses as the reason for the games' removal from sale. Certain vehicles, tracks, and other trademarks in both Project CARS releases are clearly reaching their end-of-terms, with publisher Codemasters not looking to renew the licenses for further years.\nhttps://twitter.com/projectcarsgame/status/1561730018966904832?s=20&t=Rm4FDNLqCjf4kPzzI5kaRA\n\"We will remove Project CARS from sale on October 3rd and Project CARS 2 on September 21st,\" wrote the studio. \"We remain focused on making the best racing sim titles, and, as mentioned previously, we look forward to sharing more on the next Slightly Mad project when the time is right.\"\nThere is no mention of Project CARS 3 befalling the same fate, so no doubt the 2020 sequel is currently still well within its licensing rights, though it will no doubt be similarly delisted once its time is also up.

Despite rolling out in 2017, Pokken Tournament DX has been rolling along in the competitive scene even in an official capacity, but this is the end — unless a sequel comes out eventually.\nHow do we know that for sure? Well, an official Pokemon Twitter account confirmed it back in May, before the World Championships took place, stating:\n\"When the 2022 Season concludes, #PokkenTournamentDX will no longer be part of the #PlayPokemon program. We acknowledge this game’s incredible community & its unwavering support. Thank you for creating great moments and memories with us throughout the years. Pokken is powerful!\"\n\nFast-forward to this past weekend, and that same account put out a farewell video for the Pokken Tournament community:\nhttps://twitter.com/playpokemon/status/1560702134873739265\nI can see why this happened, but it also bums me out a bit. Pokken Tournament DX should probably be bigger than it was, and when I visited Japan years back when the original Pokken was out; it seemed to have a pretty passionate scene. There's a lot of folks who dig this series, and would love to see it live on: plus, it helps bring some much-needed variety to the fighting game scene!\nThe post Unless there’s a sequel, there won’t be any official Pokken Tournament play anymore appeared first on Destructoid.",

Over three minutes of gameplay footage shows off the carnage you'll unleash against adversaries, both artificial and organic. \nPlayers wield melee weapons or firearms in one hand and more, shall we say, unconventional abilities in the other. That includes electrifying targets with lightning bolts, tossing them around with a telekinesis-like power, freezing foes solid with an ice blast, or using wires to hijack machines. The action-packed video shows off how players can creatively combine their arsenal to dismantle and disembowel anything standing in their way. \n\n\nAtomic Heart was first announced in 2018 and takes place in an alternative futuristic version of the Soviet Union in 1955. Robotic technology flourished post World War 2, allowing humanity to create a high-tech utopia. Unfortunately, these mechanical helpers have started rebelling against their human creators. If that wasn’t enough, killer mutants born from secret experiments have also run amok. Players control private agent P-3, who embarks on a secret mission to get to the bottom of what’s caused this seemingly perfect society to collapse and clean up this mess. \nAtomic Heart launches this fall for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. It’s also launching on Xbox Game Pass.",

Gameplay blends stylish swordplay with explosive gunplay as players slice and/or shoot through gang members, mercenaries, and other foes in an adventure that looks ridiculous. The release date trailer also shows off anime cutscenes, rhythm music gameplay, cute cats, and whatever else it manages to cram in. \n\n\nWanted: Dead is launching on February 14 and is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.",

He believes that this is a good thing for the gaming industry in the long run. \n“[It] is something we’re just going to see less and less of,” when discussing the idea of specific games being exclusive to a single device. “Maybe you happen in your household to buy an Xbox, and I buy a PlayStation, and our kids want to play together, and they can’t because we bought the wrong piece of plastic to plug into our television.\n“We really love being able to bring more players in reducing friction, making people feel safe, secure when they’re playing, allowing them to play with their friends, regardless of what device – I think in the long run that is good for this industry.

But I think as we get over the hump and see where this industry can continue to grow, it proves out to be true.”\nBloomberg also asked Spencer about the status of Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard acquisition, how the company will handle unions and ongoing unionization efforts happening within Activision Blizzard, and more, so be sure to check out the publication’s full story here. \n[Source: Bloomberg]\nDo you believe Spencer’s right?

          "description": "Pentiment, Obsidian Entertainment's medieval narrative adventure title, is coming on November 15. We first learned of the project during the Xbox Games Showcase in June. \nThe game's art direction emulates medieval manuscript illustrations and woodcut prints while the story unfolds in 16th-century Bavaria. You play as an illustrator who becomes wrapped up in a series of murders over 25 years. You'll engage in choice-driven conversations where your decisions steer the plot and create lasting consequences in a tale that expands into a larger conspiracy. Check out the original reveal trailer below to see it in action. \n\n\nPentiment is made by a small team within Obsidian led by director Josh Sawyer. You can pick it up on Xbox consoles and PC (day one on Game Pass). It will be the second game that Obsidian ships this year, following the 1.0 release of Grounded in September.",

So, it’s only fitting that Gamescom 2022 ended with two trailers (cinematic and gameplay) for the long-overdue zombie-slaying sequel. \n\n\nWe follow a chiseled survivor named Jacob as he leaves the safety of his (bloodied) condo and ventures into a Californian hellscape swarming with undead. He kills several adversaries with an empty rifle, jutting it through their rotten bodies and smashing their heads against the pavement with its wooden butt. \nThe gameplay trailer shows scenic beaches, forsaken suburbs, cratered city streets, and still-lit carnivals. In what is one of the most graphic clips I’ve ever seen at a game show, we watch as the player-character clobbers zombies with blunt objects, jump-kicks adversaries off roofs (parkour mechanics?), and shoots gasoline tanks to engulf hordes in flames.\n\n\nDead Island 2 is a first-person action RPG with six playable characters. And according to a designer who appeared onstage, the gory romp has an irreverent, pulpy tone and gameplay that’s all about “experimenting with your preferred zombie-slaying methods.”\nDead Island 2 punches and kicks its way onto PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on February 3.",

Plenty of blood is shed as humans are used as lab rats in Murkoff Corporation's Saw-like tests. In some cases, the tests just look like torture and flatout murder.\nThe game looks overly graphic, yet also brings about comparisons to BioShock's tone and storytelling conventions. It'll be interesting to see how the narrative sews all of these wild experiements together. The Outlast Trials is designed as both a single-player and cooperative experience. The player clearly is free to explore at certain points, and appears to rely on trap-like devices to fight back and escape. In one sequence, we see two players helping each other up to higher ground.\nThe footage concludes with news of a short closed beta running from October 28 to November 1.

          "description": "Anakin Skywalker doesn't like sand, but developer Deck13 Interactive is hoping you will love it in Atlas Fallen, a new action/RPG experience that is all about the grainy substance. This Focus Entertainment-published title debuted at Gamecom Opening Night Live, and is slated to release in 2023 for PlayStation 5 Xbox Series X/S, and PC.\nThe game is set within the sands of a timeless land, and the protagonist can unleash sand-powered abilities and infuse sand into shape-shifting weapons. The sand arsenal is used to hunt legendary monsters in either a single-player or cooperative campaign. In the cinematic trailer, we see one hero use sand to repair a bridge, and another hero glide along the sand like she's on a hoverboard. Together, the heroes create various weapons with the sand, like a whip, to down a handful of alien dogs. We'll have to wait to see how closely the gameplay mimics the cinematics.\nDeck13 Interactive is the studio behind Lords of the Fallen and The Surge series of games.",

Built to emulate the collectability, customization, and tactical sophistication of the best tabletop miniature games, Moonbreaker aims to nail the magic and appeal of the real-life hobby, but with some of the approachability inherent to video games.

Sonic Team was open about many parts of its upcoming open-zone adventure, but one part it has remained tight-lipped on is the Sonic Frontiers release date. Today, we not only got a new trailer for Sonic Frontiers but a release date for the game too.\nRevealed today during Gamescom Opening Night Live, we now know that Sonic Frontiers launches on November 8. The trailer shown during the livestream gave us a look at a second island in the Starfall Islands: Ares Island. In stark contrast to the first island we saw – Kronos Island – Ares Island appears to be a desolate, sandy biome.\n\n\nSega and Sonic Team also revealed the pre-order bonuses and the two editions players can choose from. The standard edition of Sonic Frontiers includes the base game (physical or digital), with a pre-order bonus of the Adventurer's Treasure Box, which includes skill points, Red Seeds of Power, and Blue Seeds of Defense. The Digital Deluxe edition includes a digital copy of the game, the Explorer's Treasure Box, which includes Amy's Memory Tokens, a Portal Gear, Chaos Emerald Vault Keys, and additional shoes and gloves for Sonic, and the Digital Art Book with a 25-track digital mini soundtrack. If you pre-order the Digital Deluxe edition, you also get the Adventurer's Treasure Box. The standard edition is listed for $60, while the Digital Deluxe edition is listed for $70.\nSonic Frontiers launches on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on November 8.

Glen Schofield, creative director of the new space horror adventure and one of the leading designers on the Dead Space franchise, made an appearance at Gamescom 2022. He thanked fans for the positive response and spoke about the gritty new gameplay trailer, “We’re gonna show combat and something new with a crazy ending.” \n\n\nProtagonist Jacob Lee pulls a health item with one of his abilities and proceeds to crouch-sneak his way through a group of prowling monsters. He downs one with a stab to the back and fires at another creature, stumbling toward him with tentacles squirming around its exposed belly. To top things off, he brawls with a regenerating creature adorned with cysts and sends it flying into a chainsaw-like structure in the environment. \nIn the next scene, Lee slides down a sewage drain while dodging deadly pillars along the dimly-lit channel. And in a shocking ending, reminiscent of the death scenes from Dead Space, the leading man hits a massive propeller obstructing the tunnel and gets ripped in half (I’ll spare you the gory details). Schofield warned the trailer’s ending would be wild, and it did not disappoint.\nThe Callisto Protocol launches for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on December 2.",

Publisher CI Games has long desired to bring a follow-up to market, but those plans haven't gone as planned, and the sequel bounced between several development studios before landing at Hexworks. During today's Opening Night Live festivities for Gamescom, we were treated to our first look at Hexworks' The Lords of the Fallen through a violent three-minute cinematic trailer that highlights the differences between the realms of the living and dead.\nSet one thousand years after the original, The Lords of the Fallen is designed with cooperative play in mind, allowing two players to experience uninterrupted online play. A press release describes the game as an \"expansive RPG experience filled with NPC quests, compelling characters, and rich narrative.\" The world is also said to be five times larger and interconnected. The focus is once again on soulslike combat, said to be faster than the precursor game with a touch of \"devastating magic.\"\nWhile we hear the voice of Stranger Things actor Joseph Quinn in the trailer, players will be creating their own identities. It's unknown if Quinn will be featured in the game or if he just narrated the trailer. The Lords of the Fallen doesn't have a release date yet, but will release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.\nThe world of soulslike games has evolved significantly since Lords of the Fallen hit the market.

In it, we get a look at a new Pokémon, Cyclizar, which looks very reminiscent of the two primary legendaries of this generation, Koraidon and Miraidon. Koraidon is the Scarlet legendary, and it seems rooted in the past whereas Miraidon, the Violet legendary, seems very futuristic. Perhaps Cyclizar represents the present. Only time will tell. \nCheck out the trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nBeyond Cyclizar, the trailer also reveals a few new moves and items: \nMove: Shed Tail – Create a substitute, then swap places with a party Pokémon in waiting. \nMove: Tera Blast – Changes type when the user has Terastalized.\nItem: Loaded Dice – Makes multistrike moves more likely to hit more times. \nItem: Mirror Herb  – Copies an opponent's stat increases when consumed. \n\nFor more about Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, check out this preview detailing everything we recently learned about the Paldea region, new pocket monsters, and Terastalizing. Watch this trailer that welcomes trainers to the Paldea region of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, and then check out all the new Pokémon we spotted in that trailer. \nAre you excited about these new moves or do you think they're too disruptive to the meta of competitive play?

Over the next few weeks, we’ll be covering the history and lore of Capcom’s premiere action franchise. Today we examine the franchise's boldest, most divisive, but arguably strongest entry yet in DmC Devil May Cry. \nDesiring to shake up the series, Capcom turned to British studio Ninja Theory to reboot and reimagine Devil May Cry. Encouraged by the publisher to be as wildly creative as possible, the team behind Heavenly Sword and Enslaved: Odyssey to the West dreamed up a grittier version of Dante who inhabits Limbo City, a world existing in parallel with the demonic realm. This relationship spectacularly manifests in the city itself coming to life, shifting its buildings and roads to hinder and assault the demon slayer. \nSporting jet black hair and the ability to tap into angelic and demonic powers, this new vision of Dante garnered heaps of vitriol from fans who saw DmC as too drastic of a departure, despite the game launching to rave reviews. In this episode, we'll examine how DmC came to be, the role Capcom played in the game's wildest ideas, Hideaki Itsuno's reaction to the project, the backlash Ninja Theory endured, and give our overall impressions of the narrative and gameplay. \nJoin hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), former GI editor John Carson (@John_Carson), and with special guest Bob Buel (@bobbbackwards) of the 99 Questions podcast as we unpack and pay respects to Ninja Theory's memorable stab at Devil May Cry. \nIf you’d like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com.
