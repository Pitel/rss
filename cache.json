          "description": "The power of Piglins.\nNintendo has shared a new look at Mojang's much-anticipated Minecraft Legends across its social channels, this time introducing us to a clan of fiery creatures who we can only assume will be your central opponents in the game. Seriously, have you ever seen a good guy living in a castle of flames?\nThe trailer carries some serious Lord of the Rings vibes, as an ominous narrator speaks over images of a blocky hero on horseback riding into battle against a hoard of Piglins (yes, the baddies are pigs in helmets). This mostly cinematic section gives a good idea of the fantasy feeling that the action strategy spin-off is looking to hit, with huge castles and battles seeming to be the defining feature of the game.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Another two RPG classics to dive into, dood!\nThe Prinny Presents NIS Classics Volumes 1 and Volume 2 each brought a different pair of games to Switch. The third volume brings a PlayStation classic to modern consoles as well as the Western debut of an obscure but well-loved game in the NIS stable. Die-hard tactical RPG fans might have heard of La Pucelle: Ragnarok and Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure, but they will likely be new to many fans. Fortunately, these pair of adventures manage to mostly hit the right notes even if many of their conventions and mechanics are dated.\nThe La Pucelle: Ragnarok half of Prinny Presents NIS Classics Volume 3 sends players to a world filled with French puns and culinary references. It follows the story of Prier and Culotte as they take on the job of hunting demons for the Church of the Holy Maiden. Prier is almost overly aggressive in her desire to become the next Maiden of Light, a heroic figure said to return to the world to restore balance when she is needed most. Culotte is her long-suffering younger brother who begrudgingly puts up with his sister’s antics.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "It's been a hot minute since I last crossed paths with JRPG series Wild Arms and Shadow Hearts, but today the key creators behind both of these late 90s and early 00s RPGs have announced they're making two brand-new JRPGs that are inspired by their previous works - and they're launching a 'double Kickstarter' campaign to help fund them. The games are called Penny Blood and Armed Fantasia (no points for guessing who's making what), and based on what I've seen so far, I'm intrigued. \nRead more",

It launched at £125 for a 1TB size earlier this year, but now it's down to £84 where it's rather more fetching. The 2TB size has also been reduced and is even better value at £152. Here's why we rate these SSDs - and where to find them at the lowest price.\nLet's do the 'where to find them' bit first. It's quite simple: WD's UK store is offering the 1TB at the best price right now, while Ebuyer is the place to go if you'd prefer the larger 2TB model. \nRead more",

Tuesday's Opening Night Live showcase featured a huge amount of trailers to gawk at, a baggage carousel of content that moved at a blistering clip. Despite its two hour runtime a lot of interesting (and in most cases, new) titles weren't given a huge amount space to breathe, their moment in the spotlight frequently cut short by another trailer waiting impatiently in the wings.\r\n\n\r\nYou'd be forgiven, then, for missing a few bits and pieces because you were blinking really fast or distracted by the cat eating something unknown underneath your coffee table. Not to worry though, as I've once again gathered team RPS to tell me in detail about the games that caught their attention during Geoffcom 2022.\r\n\n\r\nMuch like our E3 roundup from earlier in the summer, each RPS staffer took ten minutes out of their day to wax lyrical about an upcoming project featured within the showcase. All eight (including yours truly, who thanks to Katharine actually remembered to contribute this time around) chose completely different games. Some picks are more obvious, whereas others are a little off piste. In a good way, of course!\r\n \nRead more",

Since then, development changed hands like a baton at the Olympic relay; Yager left a year later, to be replaced by Sumo Digital, only for Sumo Digital to leave and be replaced by Dambuster Studios. Usain Bolt hasn't expressed interest yet, but there's time.\nSo going into a 20-minute hands-on with the game in the year 2022, I was a bit apprehensive. What sort of Frankenstinian horror awaited me behind closed doors? But, far from a shambling mess, what I played was a zombie 'em up that seemed close to what Graham saw in 2014, only polished up to a surprising, bloody gloss.\nRead more",

          "description": "Not that all the other wars were just a bit of goofing around, but World War One – a conflict remembered more for its bleak, arduous trench warfare than any great triumph over evil – seems like a particularly unusual source of inspiration for a strategy game that will, presumably, be played for fun. Nonetheless, The Great War: Western Front, a combination of macro planning and tactical RTS battling revealed this week at Gamescom, has elected to lean right into WW1’s complexities and difficulties rather than dance around them.\n\r\nDevelopers Petroglyph have gone for historical accuracy in various ways, senior designer Chris Becker and audio director Frank Klepacki explain to me at a hands-off demo in Cologne. The soundtrack will even include licensed music from the era. But something they want to really hammer home is the brutality of the war: territory won’t be won in heroic pushes but slowly and bloodily, while collapsing morale is as much a danger as any advancing army.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It’s a game clearly designed to mimic the picture book imagination of childhood with its hand-drawn visuals and the innocent silent presence of its protagonist, a young boy named OU and his opossum friend. Even its music is reminiscent of some lost, unknown childhood as we’re lulled into the strange world of U-Chronia with the smooth instrumentation of a single guitar and its occasional percussion. Yet it’s clear with the presence of beasts that threaten your safety and a shadowy clone that this isn’t some peaceful retreat into childhood.\nRead more",

Not Age Of Empires II this time, though. \nBecause there's no Matthew, I change the Cavern Of Lies into a cavern of moral judgement for Nate, and make him run a gauntlet of some of the most important choices in Dragon Age Inquisition with no context.

          "description": "\"The thing we're doing with The Dark Pictures is exploring different sub genres of horror,\" explains game director Tom Heaton. The Dark Pictures Anthology is, well, a horror anthology, each a compact standalone scary game where you explore and deal with QTEs and hazardous choices, in the vein of Supermassive's smash hit Until Dawn. The idea, says Heaton, is that each one takes one or two horror sub-genres and mines them, maybe subverting the tropes here and there. Up next is The Devil In Me, inspired by the infamous Chicago serial killer H. H. Holmes. \n\"What I think we decided with The Dark Pictures games early on was that the next game in the series would be very different from the last game, because we want to keep it fresh, we want to give the audience new,\" Heaton explains. So, after a zombie ghost ship in Man Of Medan, the psychological witch hauntings in Little Hope, and military squad vs. vampire aliens in House Of Ashes, Heaton pitches The Devil In Me as kind of Saw meets The Shining. It's a serial killer slasher in a weirdo hotel, and it has a true crime element. And I have to say, it's probably the most excited I've been for a Dark Pictures entry.\nRead more",

Happily though, there are also now a range of much more affordable keyboards that still include the unusual colour schemes, high-quality components and brilliant typing experiences that make mechanical keyboards so fascinating to me. One of the best makers in this space is Akko, and today a range of their best full-size and compact keyboards are on sale at Amazon UK. \nRead more",

There are people who love doing the management bits - the bean-counting, optimising the amount of salt on fries to make people thirsty and buy more drinks, paying close attention to demographics and average spends and that sort of kidney*. Then there are people who want to design a park full of cool-ass rides and different themed zones, a true magical wonderland. Inside this Park Beyond are two wolves, in other words, and each needs a different but equally robust set of tools to wrangle.\nAfter some hands on with an early build of Park Beyond, I have a little more faith that Limbic Entertainment are going to be able to pull it off. The toolset for building a rollercoast is, in particular, impressive. It's never been so easy to make a ride that breaks both the laws of physics and the laws of health and saftey. The coasters in this game are an absolute menace. In a good way.\nRead more",

Both of you occasionally interject, sometimes prompting a decision that changes the game a little as your granddad amends things to your liking. It doesn't go to the full meta-narrative lengths of a Juarez Gunslinger with it, but it's a cute touch and keeps the framing relevant.\nRead more",

          "description": "Grim Souls-like Lies Of P will be hitting PC sometime in 2023 according to a new gameplay trailer shown at Opening Night Live during this year's Gamescom. The RPG combines the story of Pinocchio with some major Bloodborne energy, as the puppet searches for a way to become a real human boy in a decimated city. This is far from the classic fairytale story though. With a dark-gothic backdrop and mechanical killer robots to contend with, Pinocchio has his work cut out for him. You can watch the new bombastic gameplay trailer below:\nRead more",

Of course, they also work for desktop computers too - and are much more portable and space-saving than an average actual desktop monitor. \nYou can even get OLED models now - and a coupon code on Amazon US brings one model down from Innocn from $350 to $200 when you tick the 'coupon' box on the product page. That's quite a bargain for a 15.6-in portable screen of this calibre. \nRead more",

Unlikely as it may seem you were right, and everyone else was wrong. It's called Moonbreaker and it's hitting early access on September 29. And Brandon Sanderson is at this party, too.\nI admit it was a trick question, but look, I'm a genuinely big fan of devs doing a completely different project after a successful game. I also know a whole lotta people who love painting plastic fighters in cool colours, carefuly placing them on a tabletop, and slowly pushing them into other plastic fighters in different colours. I'm absolutely sure that Unknown Worlds will make a very good version of a digital tabletop strategy game. I must admit, though, that whenever a video game like this emerges, I sort of wonder why tabletop-thusiasts would buy it instead of more actual miniatures.\nRead more",

Well fine then, game.\nSome of these bug reports have come from inside the house, namely Liam and Rebecca, whose respective characters have a) involuntarily shot out their own windscreen immediately upon entering every single car and b) fallen through the world when attempting to mount a motorcycle.

For LGBTQ+ people - and trans people in particular - the increasingly extreme rhetoric and legislation being weaponised against these communities can feel all-consuming. Yet it comes at a time when diverse representation in media, including games, is improving. As the number of characters stated to LGBTQ+ grows, what is more effective representation: making it possible to see your own experiences on screen, or make those experiences understandable to someone who isn't LGBTQ+?\r\n\n\r\nPeople who know of it would perhaps cite the work of developer and translator npckc, who I recently spoke with at the recent Japanese indie gaming event Bitsummit. They were there to showcase their latest game A Pet Shop After Dark, a departure from visual novels like A Year Of Springs trilogy into horror storytelling (\"more spooky than outright horror,\" as they later clarified) that's set to release later this month. Beyond the trilogy and their newest work, they’ve translated the works of other developers and worked on other smaller games and game jam projects.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "The last year or so of Elite Dangerous has been the most dramatic since the game launched in 2014. The most recent update to Frontier Developments' epic space sim, Update 13, saw the conclusion of the story's Azimuth Saga, culminating in a disastrous attempt to stop the incursion of the Thargoids – Elite's hostile race of insectoid aliens. It's an event that has already had a major impact on Elite's universe, and Frontier are excited to discuss the studio's plans for the game and its narrative as it pushes into a new phase for the galaxy, simply known as \"Aftermath\".\nBut the drama surrounding Elite Dangerous isn't limited to the game's overarching story. As I gear up to chat with lead game designer Luke Betterton and senior producer Samantha Marsh, the Thargoid in the room is Elite Dangerous: Odyssey. Launched in May last year, Elite's second expansion was, to put it lightly, not well received by Elite's community. Complaints ranged from extensive bugs and performance issues to more fundamental criticisms about the implementation of the expansion's on-foot exploration and FPS combat. Over a year on from release, the expansion still carries a \"Mostly Negative\" rating on Steam, standing in stark contrast to reviews for vanilla Elite Dangerous (now bundled with its Horizons expansion), which remain firmly positive.\nRead more",

Nastavení always může některé aplikace zpomalit a také plýtvá pamětí, proto je často v distribucích výchozím nastavením madvise.

Crystal Dynamics, Eidos Montreal, and Square Enix Montreal are all now part of the Embracer Group.\nEmbracer's acquisition was announced in May earlier this year, for a reported sum of around $300 million USD.

Finding a game that actually gets me to relax is difficult. Even some games that are intended to be relaxing seem to have the opposite effect on me. What I’ve found that works are games that don’t allow me to think about anything else, such as Doom Eternal, management games, and simulators like Densha De Go 64.\nI actually picked up Densha De Go 64 because I love the N64 and saw the game’s special controller.

The publisher not only dropped a release window for the expansion's next update but also treated Sunbreak fans to a fresh trailer, spotlighting the deadly Flaming Espinas.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxd3Dv4LTQw\nComing late September, the flashily-monikered \"Update 2\" will add a selection of new beasties to the game world, all ready and raring to be placed inside your trophy cabinet, or to make you a part of theirs. Leading the pack is the Flaming Espinas, a creature first discovered in 2008 PC release Monster Hunter Frontier Season 2.0. While typical in stature to the common Espinas, this variant boasts a hazardous orange glow, warning prey that its devastating flame breath is getting set to cinder.\nAlong with the arrival of this scary giant, Update 2 will feature new Rare creatures as well as \"powered-up variants of Sunbreak's more familiar fare. Players should also most likely expect a fresh run of balance tweaks and bug stomps, ensuring that all is well in the lands of Kamura. A third update, coming this winter, will round out Sunbreak's 2022 content, though further quests, monsters, gear, and other additions are planned for release as we head into 2023.\nMonster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak is available now on PC and Nintendo Switch.\nThe post Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak September update brings Flaming Espinas appeared first on Destructoid.",

He kicked things off by posting three videos: one that introduced the channel, one that introduced himself, and another that talked about the development concept of lingering.\nIn just two days he's now amassed nearly 300,000 subscribers (283K at the time of publication), and has posted two more videos, which you can find below. He also has a Japanese YouTube channel, which has a comparable 246K subscribers at the time of publication. Since he provides English subtitles for his aforementioned English channel anyway while speaking in Japanese, the main difference for the latter is that the on-screen text is actually in Japanese — in addition to native language subtitles.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBRt2D2YN44\nKirby's Dream Land:\nFor five minutes, Sakurai talks about Kirby's Dream Land in the new Sakurai YouTube channel clip.

          "description": "Feel the emotion\nThe Last of Us Part I hits next week, and today Naughty Dog showed off the accessibility features included in the remake. Among them is a pretty fascinating new feature for deaf players. It plays dialogue through the PlayStation 5's DualSense, letting players \"feel\" the delivery of dialogue.\nOver on the PlayStation Blog, The Last of Us Part I game director Matthew Gallant discusses some of the new accessibility features the team has developed. The DualSense dialogue tool started out as a prototype, in fact. And during playtesting, the team at Naughty Dog found it to be really successful. The feature, when toggled on, plays dialogue through the PS5 DualSense controller via haptic feedback.\n\"That way a deaf player can feel the way a line is delivered, can feel the emphasis, along with the subtitles to give some sense of how that line is delivered,\" said Gallant.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LINKh60I8CY\nAnother new feature the team has is audio description for cinematics. Naughty Dog partnered with Descriptive Video Works, a service that works in TV, movies, and game trailer, to integrate audio description into cutscenes and across all localized languages.\nEasing access\nAlongside the new tools, The Last of Us Part I also features a ton of the accessibility features seen in Part 2. This includes vision accessibility, with tools like High Contrast Display and HUD scaling. Hearing accessibility tools are also available, adding subtitle names and direction, as well as pick-up notifications and awareness indicators.\nIt's nice to see Naughty Dog carry on with these features into future games. The Last of Us Part II was recognized for its accessibility features. It's cool to see developers to continue building on and prototyping new features that can only help more people engage with their games.\nThe Last of Us Part I hits PlayStation 5 on September 2, 2022.\nThe post The Last of Us Part I accessibility features include letting players ‘feel’ dialogue through the DualSense appeared first on Destructoid.",

In classic Square Enix fashion there's some extras to be had, as well as the opportunity to pick up the PC, PS4, PS5, and Switch editions of the game.\nAs for details, it's still being billed as a single-player RPG, which kind of goes with the territory of the offline pivot. Dragon Quest X offline will arrive on September 15, 2022 in Japan, but there's also going to be an \"ultra large expansion\" coming in spring of 2023. The standard edition will run you roughly $60 US, while the special edition is about $115 US, and includes the expansion, physical pins, a slime mug, and a spoon for said mug.

This will give TGS attendees a world-first opportunity to check out the three new characters, something which isn't leaving yer boy seething with envy in any manner whatsoever.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGuVJXwENQk\nIn addition to the new Street Fighter 6 demo, Capcom will also be holding two live streams across the duration of the show. The first is the Tokyo Game Show 2022 Capcom Online Program, which will look at all of Capcom's other incoming releases, (though the publisher has confirmed Resident Evil 4 will not be in attendance at TGS 2022). The second stream, Tokyo Game Show Street Fighter 6 Special Program, will be focused purely on the new slugger, and is expected to feature at least one new character reveal trailer. Exciting stuff!\nOf course, for those not in attendance, LIKE ME, all of the pertinent news for Street Fighter 6 and all other titles being showcased at TGS will be reported right here on Destructoid. While the remainder of 2022 is looking like something of a quiet year for big releases, there's no denying that 2023 is shaping up pretty nicely, and TGS will only add fuel to that hype fire.\nTokyo Game Show 2022 will take place at Makuhari Messe between September 15-18.\nThe post Street Fighter 6 will have playable Guile, Juri, and Kimberly at TGS 2022 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The below gameplay trailer debuted ahead of TGS\nTGS (Tokyo Game Show) is scheduled to take place from September 15 through September 18 of this year, and Koei Tecmo is bringing Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty. Before the event, we're getting a taste of Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty gameplay, which is a nice surprise after the cinematic reveal at the summer Microsoft game showcase. The bosses and environments so far look worthy of the Nioh series, which is a good sign.\nIn addition to the footage, Koei Tecmo shared a few scarce details, like the existence of the \"five phases\" battle style mechanic, as well as the use of offensive and defensive maneuvers (which seems to be a huge focus of the system). We also got reconfirmation of a whole bunch of housekeeping stuff. Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty will launch on PC (Steam), PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X in \"early 2023.\" It's also confirmed as a console and PC Game Pass title.\nIf you're attending TGS, there's a few bonuses involved for those of you who can check it out physically. If you play the game in any capacity, you'll get a \"button badge\" for Wo Long. If you finish the demo, you'll get a t-shirt (while supplies last, Koei Tecmo points out). We'll also get footage of a \"never before seen stage\" at the event from the game's producers (Fumihiko Yasuda and Masaaki Yamagiwa). That'll all be at the Koei Tecmo Games booth (Hall 3, Makuhari Messe). The stream will also be taking place on Friday, September 16, at 7:20PM JST.\nWo Long: Fallen Dynasty gameplay:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1P9s_XCD1EE\nThe post Finally, a look at gameplay for Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, Team Ninja’s latest action romp appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "CNBC refutes incoming sale announcement\nThe financial analysts at CNBC have shot down circulating rumors that retail giant Amazon is preparing to announce that it has purchased legendary developer/publisher Electronic Arts (EA).\nStories of the acquisition began circulating within the last hour, which understandably caused an immediate spike in EA stock value. Since then, however, \"industry sources\" speaking with CNBC's David Faber stated that such a deal has not been struck, nor has Amazon even made a bid toward EA in regard to purchasing the studio. Bloomberg Terminal has similarly doubted the claim.\nThe initial story, posted by USA Today, cited that Amazon had already tabled an offer to the FIFA, Madden, and Mass Effect studio with an eye to acquiring the publisher and its IP catalog. Speaking fairly, USA Today rumors are believable, given ongoing whispers that EA is one of many major gaming studios looking to sell up. When recent, industry-shaking acquisitions involving companies such as Microsoft, Activision Blizzard, and ZeniMax/Bethesda are also taken into account, huge transactions such as the one rumored this morning are far more credible than they once might have been.\nThis breaking news story continues to unfold this morning. But, even as mere minutes pass, it seems more and more likely that the Amazon/EA purchase rumor is, at this stage, unfounded.\nhttps://twitter.com/CNBCnow/status/1563136384059285505?s=20&t=dj4RNZ6cr3wa42H9PGQNjw\nThe post Analysts shut down rumor Amazon will purchase EA today appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "You can resume previously regular dueling activities\nIt looks like Dark Souls 3 PC players will be able to engage with the online side of its content again. Online features for the PC version of Dark Souls 3 went back online today.\nThe news was made known through the Dark Souls Twitter account today. The Souls team is also working to restore these features for all other Dark Souls titles, as it looks like only the third is back right now. An announcement will be made when those services are back online.\nhttps://twitter.com/DarkSoulsGame/status/1562718968086872064\nThe PC servers for Dark Souls, Dark Souls 2, and Dark Souls 3 have been offline for quite some time. They were taken down after a severe exploit was uncovered in these games. An RCE exploit in Dark Souls 3 let players run malicious code, creating a pretty serious vulnerability. Players drew attention to it, and the exploit was enough to yank down the servers for all three games on PC. Console servers, meanwhile, have stayed online.\nCalling in online assistance\nWhile we've been getting steady updates on the status of these servers, it's nice to see at least one of the games back. Online features are a pretty big part of the Souls experience, ranging from PvP to calling in assistance and leaving messages.\nMeanwhile, Elden Ring has been top-of-mind for pretty much all of 2022. The same exploit was investigated and taken care of in Elden Ring, so those servers have stayed online through the whole ordeal.\nWhile it might seem like players would still gravitate towards the newcomer in Elden Ring, it's good to have these online features back up for Dark Souls 3. Newcomers who bought into Elden Ring may wish to go back and explore earlier titles, and hopefully they'll be able to do it as originally intended. No timeline's been made public on when the PC online features for Dark Souls or Dark Souls 2 will be back.\nThe post Dark Souls 3 PC servers are back online appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Here's your chance to get the latest Tomb Raider title for free\nIt's hard to keep up with all the awesome new releases in games, but sometimes, you just gotta throw it all to the wind and play an old favorite. If you're a fan of the Tomb Raider reboot series, and you're looking for a gritty adventure game to sink your teeth into, you're in luck, because Shadow of the Tomb Raider is the free game on the Epic Games Store for September.\nShadow of the Tomb Raider was originally released back in 2018 as the third game in the reboot trilogy and the twelfth mainline Tomb Raider game. The game's events take place a year after the events of its predecessor, Rise of the Tomb Raider, which came out in 2015, and finds Lara Croft racing against the clock to prevent the world from ending yet again. Arguably the darkest game in the series yet, it explores themes of descension, both through Lara's personality and the jungle itself.\n\nThe story is based on both Mayan and Aztec mythologies, and in creating the game, Square Enix devs consulted with historians to create the architecture and people of the legendary city Paititi. Fun fact: the game is still sitting at number seven on the list of most expensive games ever made, after adjusting for inflation.\nSubmerged: Hidden Depths is the other free-to-download title paired with Shadow of the Tomb Raider on the Epic Games Store. It's a relaxing exploration sim that has players uncovering the ruins of a beautiful, sunken world. If you want a more chill exploration-based gaming experience, it sounds like it's thematically fairly close to the Tomb Raider series, so it could be a fun one to try out.\nThe games are available for free download on the Epic Games Store starting September 1, so make sure to grab the roguelike \"card crawler\" Ring of Pain before it leaves the rotation next week.\nThe post Shadow of the Tomb Raider is the free game on Epic Games Store next month appeared first on Destructoid.",

Meanwhile, Green has penned scripts for Logan, Blade Runner 2049, and American Gods.\nhttps://twitter.com/netflix/status/1562864632708050945\nThese two will be tackling a live-action adaptation of the BioShock franchise.

It seems like an underwater venture seems like a safe bet.\n Would you kindly pass the remote?\nNetflix also announced some more news for its ongoing video game adaptations, locking in The Umbrella Academy showrunner Steve Blackman for the development of its Horizon Zero Dawn series.

I've enjoyed a good chunk of their previous work, and they seem like a pairing that could tackle something like BioShock in an interesting way.\nAnd hey, this news plus the recent 15th anniversary make for a good excuse to revisit BioShock.

But it wasn't! Here's how to quickly get through the Genshin Impact courtyard \"far down the corridor\" quest.\n[There are no story spoilers present below outside of the puzzle solution.]\n\nWalk up to the marked quest area, and line up the symbols to get through the Genshin Impact courtyard\nA few hours into the Genshin Impact 3.0 Archon (main story) questline, you'll encounter a section that warps you away to another area. This is all part of the Through Mists of Smoke and Forests Dark portion of Chapter III, at which point you'll encounter the \"Silent Seeker of Knowledge\" step.\nAfter jumping through a series of light platforming puzzles, you'll encounter the aforementioned \"courtyard far down the corridor.\" The thing is you're not really investigating in the courtyard per se, but in the general area. You can't go over the ledge, so step into the spot in the above image, and position your camera so that the two symbols in the background line up. The screen will change hue and doors will open on your left, allowing you to continue the quest.\n\nIt seems so simple, but sometimes not everything works out as nicely as it should.

An abstract, muddled trailer was followed by a frustratingly obscure conversation with developer Build a Rocket Boy, which left viewers oblivious as to what the ambitious title actually is.\nHowever, given its clear status as \"more than just a video game,\" it didn't take long for critics to speculate that the Everywhere platform might be tightly embedded with controversial NFT and/or blockchain technology. This speculation was further founded when it was revealed that numerous blockchain-based roles — including a coder, test engineer, and contract developer — had previously been advertised on the developer's website back in June (the va…",

And from wild powers to melee weapons and guns, it looks like you'll have a pretty fun arsenal to play with in this game.\nDeveloper Mundfish released this trailer today, spotlighting how the player can fight against hordes of mechanized combatants. They look pretty dangerous, from the regular automated grunts to giant bosses.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbIc2_FwReE\nAtomic Heart is set in a future where a failure at a Soviet facility has led to a machine uprising. As Major P-3, you have to go in, minimize consequences, and prevent critical info from leaking.\nYou'll need weapons though, to deal with all the angry robots. And it looks like you get a pretty decent variety of them. Atomic Heart is absolutely giving me BioShock vibes, in a very good way. Freezing enemies and lifting them into the air with your power-charged glove, then battering them with a makeshift melee weapon looks like a blast.\nAtomic punk\nWe've been seeing bits and pieces of Atomic Heart over the last few years, as Mundfish has continued to work away on the project. We've seen combat, exploration, story, and even one very unsettling clown enemy. Not looking forward to that fight in particular.\nIt's a game that's continued to impress me a little more each time I see new footage. And from what we saw today, it really does seem like Atomic Heart is coming together well.\nThe question at this point is, when will it launch? Mundfish published the trailer today, alongside a tweet that says it will launch on console and PC in late 2022.\nIt looks like this holiday season might see us freezing, smashing, and bashing robots in this retro-future universe.\nThe post Atomic Heart shows off more of its combat in new trailer appeared first on Destructoid.",

Dubbed Frozen Heath, this update adds new forms, challenges, and a fresh region to explore.\nFrozen Hearth takes place in an underground region that hosts The Tempering, a series of trials consisting of combat challenges and puzzles. Overcoming this contest rewards two new forms: the Killer Bee and the Mechanic, which can be used in the main game. \n\n\nOn September 13 you can buy the Frozen Hearth expansion separately for $4.99 or pick up it alongside the main game in a bundle for $27.99.  \nNobody Saved the World launched in January and became one of our early favorites of 2022. Former editor John Carson scored the game an 8.25 out of 10, writing in his review that, \n“Despite its minor shortcomings, Nobody Saves the World kept me enthralled from start to finish as I leveled my way through form ranks for the next body or ability to work with. It's most fun when unleashing devious yet approachable combat scenarios, keeping me on my toes to find the best solution to survive. Thankfully, it gave me plenty of those unrelenting loops throughout, justifying the time to save this funny little world.”",

Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. \nMetal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. \nWatch on Twitch!\nJoin me, Marcus Stewart, along with Andrew Reiner and Blake Hester, as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure.

Microsoft then declared later that day that it will not be doing the same with the Xbox Series X/S. Now, Nintendo has chimed in on the matter. \nIn a statement to Eurogamer, Nintendo reiterates a quote from president Shuntaro Furukawa, made in June, in which he stated the company has \"no plans to increase the trade price of its hardware.” Furukawa made this statement during the 82nd Annual General Meeting Shareholders that month, in which he also said: \n\"While we cannot comment on pricing strategies, we currently do not have any plans to change the price of our hardware due to inflation or increased procurement costs in each country. We will determine our future pricing strategies through careful and continued deliberations.”\nAlthough the PlayStation 5's price will remain unchanged in the U.S. (for now), both versions of the console have become more expensive in Canada, Europe, the UK, Mexico, Japan, and Australia. The price hikes have already gone into effect in those regions except Japan, which occurs on September 15. \nThe only time Nintendo significantly adjusted the price of its current consoles was last fall, when it permanently reduced the cost of the standard Switch model in the UK and Europe. Nintendo has yet to do the same in the U.S. \n[Source: Eurogamer]",

That includes electrifying targets with lightning bolts, tossing them around with a telekinesis-like power, freezing foes solid with an ice blast, or using wires to hijack machines. The action-packed video shows off how players can creatively combine their arsenal to dismantle and disembowel anything standing in their way. \n\n\nAtomic Heart was first announced in 2018 and takes place in an alternative futuristic version of the Soviet Union in 1955. Robotic technology flourished post World War 2, allowing humanity to create a high-tech utopia. Unfortunately, these mechanical helpers have started rebelling against their human creators. If that wasn’t enough, killer mutants born from secret experiments have also run amok. Players control private agent P-3, who embarks on a secret mission to get to the bottom of what’s caused this seemingly perfect society to collapse and clean up this mess. \nAtomic Heart launches this fall for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

And now that the third entry's multiplayer modes are available again, hopefully, the other games in the franchise will see the light of day, too. \nPC版『DARK SOULS III』におけるセキュリティの脆弱性調査と対応が完了したため、本日よりゲームサーバーを復旧し、オンラインサービスを再開しました。ユーザーの皆様にはお詫び申し上げますとともに、復旧をお待ちいただいたことへの御礼を申し上げます。 https://t.co/mPmnBK9Wbd\nAugust 25, 2022\nA translated From Software Support tweet (see above) reads as follows:\n\n\"We have completed the security vulnerability investigation and countermeasures for the PC version of \"DARK SOULS III,\" so we have restored the game server and resumed online services from today. We apologize to all users and thank you for waiting for the restoration.\n\nIn addition, we are also working on the PC version of \"DARK SOULS Ⅱ\" and the PC version of \"DARK SOULS REMASTERED,\" and we will inform you as soon as they are restored.

First announced last fall, the game comes from Soliel Ltd, developer of the upcoming Valkyrie Elysium, and consists of Ninja Gaiden and Dead or Alive alumni. With those credentials, it's little surprise that Wanted: Dead looks absolutely bonkers. \nThe story centers on Hong Kong cop Lt. Hannah Stone, a member of the Zombie Unit. She and her squad must get to the bottom of a corporate conspiracy, but the game doesn’t appear to be nearly as serious as its premise lets on. Gameplay blends stylish swordplay with explosive gunplay as players slice and/or shoot through gang members, mercenaries, and other foes in an adventure that looks ridiculous. The release date trailer also shows off anime cutscenes, rhythm music gameplay, cute cats, and whatever else it manages to cram in. \n\n\nWanted: Dead is launching on February 14 and is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.",

He believes that this is a good thing for the gaming industry in the long run. \n“[It] is something we’re just going to see less and less of,” when discussing the idea of specific games being exclusive to a single device. “Maybe you happen in your household to buy an Xbox, and I buy a PlayStation, and our kids want to play together, and they can’t because we bought the wrong piece of plastic to plug into our television.\n“We really love being able to bring more players in reducing friction, making people feel safe, secure when they’re playing, allowing them to play with their friends, regardless of what device – I think in the long run that is good for this industry. And maybe in the short run, there’s some people in some companies that don’t love it. But I think as we get over the hump and see where this industry can continue to grow, it proves out to be true.”\nBloomberg also asked Spencer about the status of Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard acquisition, how the company will handle unions and ongoing unionization efforts happening within Activision Blizzard, and more, so be sure to check out the publication’s full story here. \n[Source: Bloomberg]\nDo you believe Spencer’s right?

You play as an illustrator who becomes wrapped up in a series of murders over 25 years. You'll engage in choice-driven conversations where your decisions steer the plot and create lasting consequences in a tale that expands into a larger conspiracy. Check out the original reveal trailer below to see it in action. \n\n\nPentiment is made by a small team within Obsidian led by director Josh Sawyer.

So, it’s only fitting that Gamescom 2022 ended with two trailers (cinematic and gameplay) for the long-overdue zombie-slaying sequel. \n\n\nWe follow a chiseled survivor named Jacob as he leaves the safety of his (bloodied) condo and ventures into a Californian hellscape swarming with undead. He kills several adversaries with an empty rifle, jutting it through their rotten bodies and smashing their heads against the pavement with its wooden butt. \nThe gameplay trailer shows scenic beaches, forsaken suburbs, cratered city streets, and still-lit carnivals. In what is one of the most graphic clips I’ve ever seen at a game show, we watch as the player-character clobbers zombies with blunt objects, jump-kicks adversaries off roofs (parkour mechanics?), and shoots gasoline tanks to engulf hordes in flames.\n\n\nDead Island 2 is a first-person action RPG with six playable characters. And according to a designer who appeared onstage, the gory romp has an irreverent, pulpy tone and gameplay that’s all about “experimenting with your preferred zombie-slaying methods.”\nDead Island 2 punches and kicks its way onto PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on February 3.",

Plenty of blood is shed as humans are used as lab rats in Murkoff Corporation's Saw-like tests. In some cases, the tests just look like torture and flatout murder.\nThe game looks overly graphic, yet also brings about comparisons to BioShock's tone and storytelling conventions. It'll be interesting to see how the narrative sews all of these wild experiements together. The Outlast Trials is designed as both a single-player and cooperative experience. The player clearly is free to explore at certain points, and appears to rely on trap-like devices to fight back and escape. In one sequence, we see two players helping each other up to higher ground.\nThe footage concludes with news of a short closed beta running from October 28 to November 1.

As XO Camina Drummer keeps tabs on her mutinous crew, she'll also be tasked to navigate the ruins of a downed vessel on the outskirts of an asteroid belt.\nThe trailer showed Drummer space walking, dodging debris, and working her way through the massive vessel. We also see her throw a punch and grapple with someone in zero gravity. To bring this beloved science-fiction universe to life, Telltale enlisted the development talents of Deck Nine (best known for the Life is Strange series). The first pre-alpha footage looks ambitious and dark, delivering a cinematic viewpoint into an investigation riddled with death. The facial animations on the characters also look like an evolution from Telltale's previous work, yet some of the same facial features look similar.\nThe Expanse is slated to release in summer 2023.",

When he notices the explosions and opens the front door, Killer Klowns with blasters reveal themselves from behind a stack of boxed pizza pies. \nKiller Klowns From Outer Space: The Game is “a crazy new take on multiplayer horror” from the executive director of Friday The 13th: The Game. Brief gameplay clips were shown, with Killer Klowns firing lasers at fleeing civilians in a carnival playspace.

The boss fight features some standard point-and-shoot combat, but it also features some platforming too by way of a grapple hook-like knife tongue thing in your arsenal.

This Focus Entertainment-published title debuted at Gamecom Opening Night Live, and is slated to release in 2023 for PlayStation 5 Xbox Series X/S, and PC.\nThe game is set within the sands of a timeless land, and the protagonist can unleash sand-powered abilities and infuse sand into shape-shifting weapons. The sand arsenal is used to hunt legendary monsters in either a single-player or cooperative campaign. In the cinematic trailer, we see one hero use sand to repair a bridge, and another hero glide along the sand like she's on a hoverboard. Together, the heroes create various weapons with the sand, like a whip, to down a handful of alien dogs.

Sonic Team was open about many parts of its upcoming open-zone adventure, but one part it has remained tight-lipped on is the Sonic Frontiers release date. Today, we not only got a new trailer for Sonic Frontiers but a release date for the game too.\nRevealed today during Gamescom Opening Night Live, we now know that Sonic Frontiers launches on November 8. The trailer shown during the livestream gave us a look at a second island in the Starfall Islands: Ares Island. In stark contrast to the first island we saw – Kronos Island – Ares Island appears to be a desolate, sandy biome.\n\n\nSega and Sonic Team also revealed the pre-order bonuses and the two editions players can choose from. The standard edition of Sonic Frontiers includes the base game (physical or digital), with a pre-order bonus of the Adventurer's Treasure Box, which includes skill points, Red Seeds of Power, and Blue Seeds of Defense. The Digital Deluxe edition includes a digital copy of the game, the Explorer's Treasure Box, which includes Amy's Memory Tokens, a Portal Gear, Chaos Emerald Vault Keys, and additional shoes and gloves for Sonic, and the Digital Art Book with a 25-track digital mini soundtrack.

Glen Schofield, creative director of the new space horror adventure and one of the leading designers on the Dead Space franchise, made an appearance at Gamescom 2022. He thanked fans for the positive response and spoke about the gritty new gameplay trailer, “We’re gonna show combat and something new with a crazy ending.” \n\n\nProtagonist Jacob Lee pulls a health item with one of his abilities and proceeds to crouch-sneak his way through a group of prowling monsters. He downs one with a stab to the back and fires at another creature, stumbling toward him with tentacles squirming around its exposed belly. To top things off, he brawls with a regenerating creature adorned with cysts and sends it flying into a chainsaw-like structure in the environment. \nIn the next scene, Lee slides down a sewage drain while dodging deadly pillars along the dimly-lit channel. And in a shocking ending, reminiscent of the death scenes from Dead Space, the leading man hits a massive propeller obstructing the tunnel and gets ripped in half (I’ll spare you the gory details). Schofield warned the trailer’s ending would be wild, and it did not disappoint.\nThe Callisto Protocol launches for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on December 2.",

Publisher CI Games has long desired to bring a follow-up to market, but those plans haven't gone as planned, and the sequel bounced between several development studios before landing at Hexworks. During today's Opening Night Live festivities for Gamescom, we were treated to our first look at Hexworks' The Lords of the Fallen through a violent three-minute cinematic trailer that highlights the differences between the realms of the living and dead.\nSet one thousand years after the original, The Lords of the Fallen is designed with cooperative play in mind, allowing two players to experience uninterrupted online play. A press release describes the game as an \"expansive RPG experience filled with NPC quests, compelling characters, and rich narrative.\" The world is also said to be five times larger and interconnected. The focus is once again on soulslike combat, said to be faster than the precursor game with a touch of \"devastating magic.\"\nWhile we hear the voice of Stranger Things actor Joseph Quinn in the trailer, players will be creating their own identities. It's unknown if Quinn will be featured in the game or if he just narrated the trailer. The Lords of the Fallen doesn't have a release date yet, but will release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.\nThe world of soulslike games has evolved significantly since Lords of the Fallen hit the market.

It’s exciting to be a part of, and we can’t wait to reveal more about Everywhere in coming months.”\nEverywhere is slated to arrive in 2023, though no platforms were specified.",

Additionally, the system boasts new orb-like controllers with haptic feedback and adaptive triggers (like the DualSense), a single cord setup with PlayStation 5 consoles for ease-of-access, a see-through view, and better resolution/tracking – we're talking two different modes of visual fidelity. \nAccording to our very own Marcus Stewart, \"VR mode displays VR content in a 360-degree view in 4000 x 2040 HDR video format (2000 x 2040 per eye) and 90Hz/120Hz frame rate.
