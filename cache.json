          "description": "Great gameplay never goes out of style.\nGreat games are great no matter how much time has passed, and that remains true of Company of Heroes. The RTS classic that robbed us of our evenings and weekends back in 2006 has returned to the Nintendo Switch in the form of the Company of Heroes Collection and despite an updated control scheme for the console, after a few hours, it became like slipping on a comfortable, familiar pair of boots.\nRight from the beginning, we were reminded that this isn’t Call of Duty or another series that glorifies or sanitises warfare. The first mission of the core game drops players directly into the Normandy Beach invasion and treats us to a cutscene where entire platoons of soldiers are mowed down by German machine-gun fire. It is brutal and depressing, as depictions of war should be, and does a good job of setting up the difficult, tactical gameplay that you'll be dropped into.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Before the Lobotomy.\nBringing cult classics to a more modern, updated platform can be a risky proposition. What, if anything, do you change, and what do you keep the same? When the game you happen to be porting originated on the DS, a certain degree of change is inevitable given the shift from a two-screen to a single-screen format, so naturally, a careful balance has to be struck in order to rope in new players while keeping original fans happy. With Dementium: The Ward, developer Atooi has opted for the safest route possible, porting its 2015 3DS remaster of the 2007 original over to the Switch with as few unnecessary changes as possible. While this makes for an authentic recreation that helps preserve the game in light of the 3DS eShop closure, it also highlights some of its unfortunate drawbacks.\nTaking place within a creepy medical ward, your protagonist awakens with no memory, and it’s up to you to escape from the complex alive, fighting off gruesome enemies and solving puzzles along the way. It’s your typical survival horror but with first-person mechanics; in a way, it feels like a precursor to what Resident Evil would eventually morph into with its seventh mainline entry.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "I'm honestly a little surprised by how much I'm enjoying Star Trek: Infinite. It is not the ultimate Star Trek strategy game, but nor is it a bog standard 4X strategy in an unfortunate 80s leotard. \"Lets you play your own Star Trek story\" is a fair summary of what it's about, even if the bulk of that story in practical terms is building space stations to claim territory, and filling up planets with farms, cities, and empire-specific labour camps, forums, and whatever hippie garbage the feds have. Of course, it has the advantage of riding the coattails of already-established fiction and maybe that's cheating a little, but the result is a sort of grand 4X that in most regards I've enjoyed more the longer I played it.\nRead more",

The game's first story DLC expansion, Haus, amps up the weirdness of the environments by transporting you to a \"surreal, psycho-horror dreamscape\" in blissful Malibu.\nThere are flashes of Glass Onion and The Menu here, but I was reminded just as much of the eerier parts of Bioshock, that underwater monument to crackpot billionaires with far too much time on their hands.

We thought the original was average and largely forgettable, so how does the new LOTF stack up against it nine years later? Well, it's definitely going to appeal to more folks by being a fairly enjoyable soulslike that ticks most checkboxes, and that rises above most of the competition by popping a magic lantern in your hands.\nRaise a light to the dark fantasy world and it'll reveal a more dribbly parallel universe you can warp between at almost any time. This spooky lantern might open up some cool realm-hopping twists on your grim adventure, and the game as a whole might instil a sense of exploration sure to please souls fans after a familiar hit of uncertain peril, but its finer details chip away at your patience. It's not long before your tentative pushes through horrible towns and creaky walkways soon give way to wild sprint finishes born from pure frustration.\nRead more",

          "description": "Whereas most games begin by getting you into the action as quickly as possible, Saltsea Chronicles opens with a quick note about its save system. It's a small, but important detail in this story-driven adventure game, as throughout its nine-to-ten-hour run time, you'll be faced with various decisions about where your crew of post-apocalyptic drifters will explore next, as they set sail in search of their missing captain Maja. By choosing one island at the end of every chapter, you'll naturally miss out on visiting another - and with 14 locales to explore in total in the Saltsea archipelago (and only 12 chapters to do it in), each playthrough has the potential to end up being quite different from the last.\nBut up front it tells you \"There are no wrong choices, only your choices\" in Saltsea Chronicles, and that ultimately this is a tale about \"tracing different pathways\" using its clever branching save system. While you can, of course, play it through from start to finish in a single swoop, you also have the option to purloin its additional save slots to take those roads less travelled (presented here as delightful, wiggling seaweed tendrils), and all without overwriting your existing adventure. Immediately, that sense of FOMO is dispelled, and instead of worrying about 'seeing everything' or making sure you get a 'good' playthrough, you can simply enjoy its enthralling tale of high seas soap opera, curious exploration, and the knotty drama that comes with trying to forge connections in an increasingly fragmented world. It's a journey well worth taking, even if what lies at the end of it didn't quite come together in the way I'd hoped.\nRead more",

In this deceptively Civilization-esque 4X strategy game, all player turns unfold simultaneously, once you've decided what to build or research, where to move your units, and so on. As Oxide Games design director Michelle Menard tells me over Zoom, this approach takes inspiration from an ancient military simulator, Kriegsspiel, which was devised by the Prussian army officer George Leopold von Reisswitz, aka the \"father of wargaming\", in the mid-1800s. \r\n\n\r\n\"It was to train their generals, it was a legit apparatus of war, it was not for funsies,\" says Menard. \"And they basically created this massive table that had a modular terrain system. At first they used sand, but that was kind of messy, [and so] they developed a system where they had interchangeable tiles, like hills and valleys and plateaus. \r\n\n\r\n\"They would build out this table, literally drop a sheet down the middle, and it'd be like, OK, you guys on each side, you can't see what the other person's doing. There was an actual game master, who was the referee who you would report your moves to. He would then re-set up the board and basically call people back into the room and be like, tada! It's the next turn - let's see what people did. Was it what you expected?\" \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "In terms of usefulness to the average PC owner, sales events like Amazon Prime Big Deal Days aren’t just for knocking hundreds off big-ticket hardware. They can also make already-affordable kit even more of a bargain, as is the case with the Logitech G413 SE mechanical keyboard: a snip at £60. \r\n\n\r\nThis has been on our best gaming keyboards list for a while now, specifically for delivering all the satisfying finger-feel (and durability) of a true mechanical board with a pricing that puts it closer to high-end membrane and hybrid switch models. The G413 SE employs the bumpy 'tactile' style of mech switches, so it’s good for accurate typing, and it’s easily fast and agile enough for gaming duty as well. I actually ended up using this as my main keyboard for a while, despite having more expensive linear-switch boards piled up in a nearby cupboard, and I’d extra-extra-recommend it at this price.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Many Minecrafters feel the Mob Vote (which has extended to potential new Minecraft biomes in the past) is needlessly parsimonious, and cynically divisive: given Mojang's current headcount and Microsoft's resources, why not add all three mobs to the game, rather than asking players to do battle over scraps?

          "description": "Sometimes, when I’m winning a Total War battle handily, I like to pick an absolutely haggard group of low-tier hopelesses and spend the rest of the fight zoomed in on them, narrativising their high-stakes struggles in a rich and velvety internal monologue that monopolises my attention so fully that I more or less ignore the rest of the battle. That these are among my absolute favourite Total War moments may say something about the level of satisfaction to be found elsewhere in the series’ strategy sandboxes, at times as robust as ancient oaks, others as stale as ancient wotsits. It may be an admission on both our parts that, for all its simulated complexity, Total War is really for people who’d be just as happy playing with those little elasticated catapults and plastic castles, if we could still sit on the floor without our pelvises crumbling into soup mix.  \r\n\n\nTotal War: Pharaoh, which I will acknowledge once and once only as being officially stylised PHARAOH, is almost certainly the most systemically interesting and quality-of-life-full a Total War game has been at launch for a very long time. Three Kingdoms has better diplomacy, Warhammer has unequivocally better goblins, but none are as refreshingly cavalier and passionately thorough with the blueprint of what Total War has the potential to be. CA Sofia should be immensely proud of what they’ve done here, but the realities of Total War’s ridiculous release schedule now clearly mean that even a studio as willing and able to innovate so much in such a short time frame are effectively prevented from producing a genuinely exciting strategy game. I’d love to tell you these new plastic castles are more fun than your old ones, but there’s not even any catapults.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The Meta Quest 2 was the ideal gaming VR package: powerful and accessible enough to provide easy, convincing immersion, while also staying highly affordable. Nonetheless, Meta’s sudden fixation on creating a legless version of Second Life did have me worried about the future trajectory of its VR hardware. What daft gimmickry would their next headset come festooned with, and what would it mean for the future of the Quest as a gaming device?\r\n\n\r\nWith the Meta Quest 3, we have the answer. And the truth is, Meta’s latest headset does have a whiff of Metaverse about it. Dubbed a \"mixed reality\" device, its raison d’être is to break down the barrier between reality and the virtual world. While mixed reality is an angle I’m not wholly sold on from a gaming perspective, crucially, the features that make it a mixed reality device are useful even if you don’t want to hold a meeting in your office with a bunch of bisected Sims. Moreover, they’re built into a headset that is more powerful, more comfortable, and generally better than the Meta Quest 2.\r\n\n \nRead more",

If you enjoy Slay The Spire and FTL, do have a look, though I might argue that FTL's follow-up, Into The Breach seems a stronger influence. Ah, play the demo and see for yourself!\nRead more",

Or at least, that's my summary of his thoughts following the recent announcement on Xitter that Alan Wake 2 will have a performance mode on PS5 and Xbox Series X, allowing consoleers for whom responsiveness is a priority to eke a higher frame-rate out of a game \"built from the beginning as a 30fps experience focusing on visuals and ambiance.\"\nPuha has subsequently been chatting to press about the creation of the mode and Alan Wake 2's visuals at large. In what has become a time-honoured ceremony for any AAA game developer a month or two before release, he took a moment to observe that focussing on frame-rate vs resolution is missing the wood for the trees. (The trees in question do take a toll on Alan Wake 2's performance, but we'll get to that further down the page.)\r\n\n \nRead more",

You are, indeed, being buried alive. The person burying you is your girlfriend, who waves aside your protests that you aren't dead yet, pointing out that this is exactly what a dead person would say if they were trying to avoid being buried. Can't fault the logic.\nClick the downward arrow below the animated image of your girlfriend burying you alive and you'll discover a murky fungal blackscreen where cartoon rats periodically try to eat you, unless you click to get rid of them. Below that, there's a kind of Alice in Wonderland-style alcove in which a tousled lady with a rat on her shoulder reassures you that being buried alive ain't so bad. As she points out, \"underground is like, the only place to escape capitalism, plus it's nice and cool\". Again, I can't fault the logic. Then she offers to play cards with you. The cards in question have rats doodled on them, including a wonderfully festive rodent Joker. There is passing mention of a \"rat god\".\nRead more",

He was telling BioWare stories even before he joined the company. The meeting of Minsc and Boo, one of the most enduring partnerships in PC gaming, came about in a tabletop Dungeons & Dragons game he ran as a teenager. Then a comic book store manager, he took advantage of his premises to guide no fewer than three concurrent D&D groups through their campaigns. “I didn’t really have much of a life outside of Dungeons & Dragons,” he says. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "There's a side mission in Cyberpunk 2077 that involves abducting a notorious union-breaker. One wonders if any of the people who worked on that have joined the union founded by CD Projekt RED employees this month. The union is part of the larger Polish worker's organisation OZZ Inicjatywa Pracownicza, and comes in response to CD Projekt's firing around 100 employees in July due to \"overstaffing\". Its membership is anonymous and open to people in the industry who aren't employed by the Witcher and Cyberpunk studio, but are thinking about forming a union in their own workplace.\r\n\n\r\n\"We started talking about unionizing after the 2023 wave of layoffs when 9% of Reds (that is roughly 100 people) were let go,\" reads an official FAQ from the group. \"This event created a tremendous amount of stress and insecurity, affecting our mental health and leading to the creation of this union in response. Having a union means having more security, transparency, better protection, and a stronger voice in times of crisis.\"\r\n\n \nRead more",

Since I skipped last year's installment, and searches for \"Axis Football 2022\" brought up nothing, I got horribly confused and wrongly stated that the series skipped 2022 entirely. I apologise for this embarrassing error, and for not realising it until the exact moment everyone at RPS went home for the weekend. Although that latter part is at least quite funny.\nAxis Football 2024 is part of the little Americaball series that could. Since 2019 I've settled into a habit of skipping every second entry, only to learn that this time, its developers did too.\nThe result is still iterative improvement, but a more noticeable one in lots of small ways. Its animations in particular combine more naturally, with players visibly struggling to tackle, catch, or shake off an opponent. It feels like a punchier sport, making the significance of blocking and positioning clearer, and bringing out the drama that its coaching mode in particular really thrives on.\r\n\n \nRead more",

There have been so many middling sequels and spin-offs. But somehow, I can't let go.

It introduces a new season journey and questline, a new season event, and some skulking new enemies of the Nosferatu persuasion.\r\n\n\r\nThe new quest sounds quite fun from the promotional materials. It sees you investigating a mysterious outbreak of punctured necks, recruiting a local Van Helsing named Erys, and tracking down a Dark Master, while harnessing 22 juicy new vampiric powers care of some pact armour.  The latter range from turning into a cloud of bats, through cursing people, to treating yourself to a spontaneous bloodbath so as to enhance your channeled skills, The trade-off is that you'll have to acquire yet another Diablo 4 resource, potent blood, to perform these tricks.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Mirage cares not for being the glossy poster child of ray-traced glamour; it’s just a game that looks pretty nice and runs well on PC, older hardware and Steam Decks included.\nIt also keeps its list of graphics settings relatively brief, though there are a few in there that can dish out some extra frames per second at little cost to the visuals.

They're sort of The Lord of the Rings, but with talking woodlands animals, and their appeal for me consisted of three things 1) comedy British accents, 2) big fights, and 3) big feasts. I couldn't get enough, to the point that I tried to have one of my unborn siblings named after a badger warcry from the novel Salamandastron.\nFast-forward to 2023, and Oregon-based Soma Games are about to release a Redwall videogame, titled The Lost Legends of Redwall: The Scout Anthology. Will it measure up to my childhood fantasies about acorn pancakes slathered with gorseflower honey, or forest logboat armadas of squabbling guerilla shrews? Probably not, but what can? Here's a new trailer from publisher Forthright Entertainment.\nRead more",

I'm not sure The Fabulous Fear Machine - devised by Fictiorama Studios in partnership with AMC and Shudder - is quite that horrifying, but it's certainly chewing on my nerve endings in an engrossing way. \r\n\n\r\nIt's a top-down management sim, which might not sound very scary, but just look at those colours - irradiated and unwholesome shades of purple and yellow, spreading over chunky, HyperCard continents emblazoned with pulp comic fonts. The visuals wear away at you like the stink of hydrochloric acid. And then there's that red-eyed, turbaned figure, gazing at you in top left. This is the face of the Fabulous Fear Machine. Its offer: to enable your character's world-toppling ambitions. Its price: that your story will become part of its story. The game is out today, and I've got some thoughts ahead of a possible review.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Bandai Namco has released an update of the Sand Land story trailer that focuses mostly on the English voice cast.\n\n\nI’ve kept one eye on Sand Land, but not because it’s based on Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama. It’s mostly because the desert environment and assortment of vehicles remind me of my beloved Metal Max. The latest trailer shows off a bit more of the vehicles, with their combat being shown off in particular. I mean, we've seen this trailer before and even heard previews, but I just like tank combat.\n\n\n\n\nAs for the voices, they sure are speaking English. I kind of hate voiceovers in trailers because when they’re devoid of most of their context, it just feels off. Bandai Namco provided a list of who’s playing what role, and I had to look all of them up. Risa Mei is doing Beelzebub, John Lipow is on Rao (the ranger-looking guy), Owen Thomas is Thief, and Keith Silverstein is Lucifer. It’s an experienced cast, but no massive celebrities from other media, which is honestly preferable.\n\n\nSand Land is set in an expansive wasteland that has overtaken the planet in the wake of war and environmental disasters. Beelzebub joins a crew that seeks to find a source of water in the sun-blasted environment. It’s based on a 2000 serial comic from Weekly Shōnen Jump by Akira Toriyama. I’m just here for the tanks and vehicular exploration.\n\n\nThe release date for Sand Land release date is still to be announced, but it’s set to release on PC, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, and PS5.\n\nThe post Updated Sand Land story trailer shows off the English dub and vehicular combat appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Diablo 4 Community Director Adam Fletcher revealed on Twitter today that the ARPG will be Steam Deck Verified when it launches on Steam. Diablo 4 will be heading to Steam with the upcoming Season 2, Season of Blood. The second season releases on October 17 on all platforms, and will be the first time D4 is playable on Steam. The Store Page for the game on Steam has already been updated to indicate its verification.\n\n\n\n\nThis is honestly a pretty big move. The other Blizzard game that recently came to Steam, Overwatch 2, is Playable on Steam Deck but not Verified. One of the many issues players have with OW2 on Steam is its poor performance on Steam Deck.\n\n\nThe decision to make Diablo 4 Steam Deck Verified is a good one because the gameplay fits pretty naturally on a handheld device like the Steam Deck. The verification indicates that Valve has tested D4 on the device and can verify that it is fully functional and works great with the built-in controls and display.\n\n\nA note on the verification page points out that the singleplayer gameplay will still require an active internet connection.\n\n\nDiablo 4 comes to Steam and Steam Deck on October 17 with the launch of Season 2.\n\nThe post Diablo 4 Steam launch will be Steam Deck Verified appeared first on Destructoid.",

The game, based on the Spy x Family anime, is in the works for Switch, PlayStation 4 and 5, and PC, and it's essentially a minigame collection starring Anya. Yes, the littlest faux family member is adorable enough to deserve her own game. Their adopted, prescient dog, Bond, would do well as a playable hero, too. \n\n\nAs a whole, though, Operation Memories looks like an appetizer of empty calories before a more substantial main course.\n\n\nWhat we've seen so far isn't exactly bad, per se, but I'm anxious for the main course.

Take one part anthropomorphic animal anime girl and add a few dashes of Final Fight and River City Girls and you get the idea.

Kamiya went live with the appropriately named Hideki Kamiya Channel, and the first video is up in both Japanese and English. \n\n\nThe outspoken, block-happy creator didn't waste any time getting to the question on everyone's minds. The inaugural video addresses why he quit PlatinumGames and what his plans are next.

Shelly “Bombshell” Harrison was created as a stand-in for Duke Nukem, so it seems appropriate that Shelly (I’m not sure Bombshell is a nickname that will stick) would eventually make it to the engine that made him famous.

The French publisher shared its Assassin's Creed Mirage sales news, noting figures include PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. Ubisoft also provided some fun stats about our playtime.\n\n\n\n\nInitial Assassin's Creed Mirage sales numbers seem impressive\n\n\n\"We are proud to [..] share that Assassin's Creed Mirage is the biggest New Gen launch in terms of units sales to date at Ubisoft (PS5, Xbox Series X-S),\" said Ubisoft in a social media post thanking its audience. \"A big congratulations to the Bordeaux Studio and all its partners in the project for this accomplishment.\" \n\n\nUbisoft did not give specific numbers as to how Assassin's Creed Mirage has sold. However, we now know it has initially sold better in its first week than the likes of Watch Dogs: Legion, Assassin's Creed Valhalla, and Immortals: Fenyx Rising.\n\n\nImage via Ubisoft\n\n\nSome of the stats celebrated the occasion are kind of fun, too. So far, players have spent 479 collective years parkouring the rooftops of Baghdad. Assassins also took 60 million Leaps of Faith. Then there's the most important, we've pet 1.2 million street cats.\n\n\nAssassin's Creed Mirage is a stroll away from the massive open-world formula of recent titles like Valhalla and Odyssey. It's in a smaller space in Baghdad with a focus on the core stealth gameplay. Perhaps this approach appeals to lapsed fans of the series. It is also at a cheaper price point of $49.99.\n\n\n\"For the most part, Mirage achieves its goal of returning to its assassin ways,\" says our review. \"But in some ways, it also shows me why Ubisoft made the decision to take the franchise in a new direction in the first place.\"\n\nThe post Assassin’s Creed Mirage is the “biggest new gen launch” for Ubisoft yet appeared first on Destructoid.",

Initially, it was thought that the QA department would be the main focus of the layoffs. However, it appears as though redundancies may be felt in the IT, HR, marketing, customer service, and usability departments.\n\n\nImage via Team17.\n\n\nDevelopers are said to have contacted Eurogamer with concerns that upcoming games published by Team17 may be in jeopardy. At the time of writing, the studio has not issued an official statement, nor publically given a reason behind the restructure.\n\n\nA bad time to be part of a development team\n\n\nThis seems to be just one more example of a wider issue in the current gaming industry. Publishers and studios have been restructuring departments and teams, which has unfortunately led to staff members being let go.\n\n\nRecently, it was reported that Naughty Dog had also been hit with layoffs, as had The Walking Dead and Wolf Among Us studio Telltale Games. Epic Games has also cut 16% of its workforce recently, impacting around 830 employees in total.\n\n\nIt's not just game developers, either. Streaming service Twitch has also been experiencing layoffs, making it feel like anyone who works in gaming in any capacity isn't safe.\n\n\nHopefully, Team17 will issue a statement about the reported layoffs, but right now feels like a shaky time to be involved in the video game industry.\n\nThe post Worms developer Team17 set to lay off a third of its staff appeared first on Destructoid.",

It’s coming to PS5 and PC.\n\n\nReleased in Japan in mid-2022, a lot of fans have been wondering if D3 had any intention on bringing it to the West. The series has had some popularity over here since the surprising success of 2006’s Earth Defense Force 2017.\n\n\nImage via D3Publisher\n\n\nEarth Defense Force 6 is a direct sequel to 2017’s Earth Defense Force 5. 90% of the world’s population was wiped out in the previous invasion, and while the survivors are trying to pick up the pieces, the remaining invaders on the planet are making it difficult. As a result, rather than clean urban areas, you’ll be defending the ruins of civilization from giant bugs and such. Beyond that, it kind of looks like more of the same. You have the four classes – Ranger, Air Raider, Wing Diver, and Fencer – and you’re basically just tasked with killing a lot of kaiju.\n\n\nMy most memorable experience with the series was plucking it from a bargain bin in the early days of the Xbox 360 and playing through it with a close friend. It was jank bordering on kusoge. There was one amazing plasma weapon we got, and whenever I’d fire it, the resulting bright bloom would somehow cross over the split-screen barrier and temporarily blind my co-op partner. It was amazing. I’ve kept up with the series since then, but it really hasn’t changed all that much over the years. And that’s mostly okay. It can be hard to stay invested in more of the same, but the formula endures the test of time.\n\n\nEarth Defense Force 6 will be coming West sometime in Spring 2024.

From the metropolitan streets of New Atlantis to seeing planets from low orbit, Bethesda has given us an attractive-looking game.

Twitter user @Nintendeal noted that Nintendo has surreptitiously swapped out the box art. This change can be seen on the eStore. \n\n\n\n\nThe new art is almost entirely the same, save for a few extremely minor changes. Most notably, Princess Peach has been slightly edited to have more of a determined face, making her look like she's ready for battle. \n\n\nKung-fu Peach in the background has also been given a fiercer face. Princess Peach isn't the first Nintendo character to get this treatment, as Reddit user /u/Stilgrave has noticed that Kirby gets an angrier face in his Western releases. \n\n\nOnline, reception to the change has been mixed. Some people like the old face, describing it as friendlier. Others have taken a liking to the redesign which shows that Princess Peach isn't anyone to mess with. \n\n\nAs trailers reveal, the game will have the princess putting on different outfits that grant her unique abilities. She'll be joined by Stella, who also looks prepared for battle.\n\nThe post Princess Peach: Showtime! box art gives Peach a fierce new look appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Lords of the Fallen is brutal. I mean like, really brutal. I fully intended to have beaten the game and written a full review in time for release. But according to a recent tweet by the developers, there are 30 bosses in total. Which means I have...uhh...a few more to go. And for the record, I'm no Soulslike newbie. I've Platinumed most games in the series, and at least beaten those I haven't. But like I said, Lords of the Fallen is hard.\n\n\nOf all the bosses I've fought so far, I've had varied feelings all across the board. Some have been incredibly fun, with well-thought-out mechanics.

          "description": "As Hollywood still grapples with strikes and other issues, Disney CEO Bob Iger is pressed on a different matter: gaming. According to Bloomberg, advisers at the company want to expand its video game outreach by transforming Disney from distributing game license to a gaming giant. However, Iger is reportedly not too keen on the idea.\n\n\nBloomberg's report outlines the struggles facing Disney and its CEO in detail. Options like gambling, through ESPN and sports betting, have been something that Iger reportedly pushed back on but has now relented on. For gaming, while Disney has licensed their properties to studios, it sounds like Iger's deputies want Disney more involved in the process. One potential option raised by the report is an acquisition, suggesting Electronic Arts as a suitable pick-up.\n\n\nEA, one of gaming's biggest publishers, seems like an ideal candidate to buy. Over the years, the company has created hugely successful franchises like Titanfall, Mass Effect, and Battlefield. Money-wise, the gaming giant is responsible for the EA Sports catalog of games, which rake in millions a year and lines up with its ESPN interests. EA also has a history with Disney, as they licensed Star Wars for their Battlefront and Jedi series of games. \n\n\nCuriously, it sounds like Bob Iger isn't interested in the idea right now. While no reason is given, it's likely that it's not a direction he wants to take Disney. These all are rumors, so, much like the story of Disney's Kingdom Hearts, don't take it too seriously.\n\nThe post Disney CEO reportedly urged to consider making company a gaming giant appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "No, you're not reading that wrong. Former late-night host and Cinderella star James Corden reportedly hosted a town hall meeting for Activision. The company, run by Bobby Kotick, is making headlines as Microsoft may close its $68.7 billion purchase of them on Friday. \n\n\nAccording to sources speaking to Windows Central, an internal meeting between Kotick and employees recently occurred. James Corden, the 'mastermind' behind Carpool Karaoke, emceed the conference, much like Jamie Kennedy did at E3 2009: unnecessarily. Kotick, who has been CEO of Activision since 1991, responded to a bevy of questions.\n\n\n\n\nHe talks about the potential for AI and VR, as well as Elon Musk's Neuralink. Weirdly, he also mentions that, with Microsoft's advanced technology, a potential Guitar Hero revival was teased. A repeated phrase that popped up a lot during the meeting was \"magic\", as Kotick believes Microsoft will keep it alive, just as Activision has for more than 40 years.\n\n\nIt seems like the company, likely to soon become part of Microsoft, wants to deliver fresh content to consumers. Having already absorbed studios Blizzard and King, Activision can finally work on creating a bigger legacy. However, it seems they want to experiment with new technologies more than to build upon what they have. Microsoft had said they wanted to compete with Apple and Google in mobile gaming, which led to them purchasing Activision. While some may dislike the company, Call of Duty, Candy Crush Saga, and World of Warcraft continue to make millions of dollars every year. Where the future might go is unclear. But please don't let James Corden be in Call of Duty.\n\nThe post James Corden hosts weird Activision town hall meeting with Bobby Kotick appeared first on Destructoid.",

As each character has their own set of abilities and attacks, combining them with others can lead to unique power dynamics\n\n\nNarrative-wise, Jujutsu Kaisen Cursed Clash adapts the events of season one of the anime, as well as Jujutsu Kaisen 0. In the story mode, you'll face familiar villains like Sukuna and Jogo and learn about the hidden world of sorcerers. With co-op and competition modes, you'll be able to team up with fellow sorcerers online and face others worldwide in casual or ranked battles. Players will also get to customize their face cards and fighters via costumes. New outfits and cards can be unlocked through gameplay and future DLC.\n\n\nScreenshot via PlayStation YouTube\n\n\nJujutsu Kaisen Cursed Clash will be available in three editions: standard, digital deluxe, and digital ultimate. While the standard only includes the base game, the digital deluxe has the Hidden Inventory/Premature Death DLC and a minigame based on Jujusta 2024 Baseball. Furthermore, the digital ultimate edition comes with all that plus a digital artbook and soundtrack. Additionally, it comes with a costume pack adapting outfits from the \"Lost in Paradise\" end theme from season one. If you preorder the game, you'll receive the First-Year Jujutsu High DLC costume pack.\n\n\nJujutsu Kaisen Cursed Clash expands onto current-gen consoles on February 2, 2024.

That's a great thing, as 2D Mario has been formulaic throughout its history, so we could use a change-up. I'm just glad we're presumably done with the \"New\" series: I mean, it's not new anymore! \n\n\nAll that to say, I just really wanted to share this strange promotional tweet of Bowser being really into an elephant Peach (which is also on YouTube as a short).\n\n\n\n\nPeach speaks (kinda)\n\n\nIn the short 30-second promotional video, Bowser tries to impress Princess Peach with a bouquette of flowers (as he does), and an Elephant Fruit sidles up to the duo and turns Peach into an elephant. After his initial shock, Bowser immediately proposes (we assume) to Peach again. Classic Bowser, completely undeterred by pretty much anything in his life. I can't wait to see him again in Super Mario RPG: he's been missed.\n\n\nInterestingly enough, this is also a brief look at the voice of Peach, amid a major casting change for Mario. Just give us the full voice credits already, Nintendo! I want to see who has been replaced.\n\n\nSuper Mario Bros. Wonder is out on Switch on October 20, and I can't wait to see what it can do. I have a feeling that what Nintendo has shown off so far is just scratching the surface, which would be the shot in the arm the 2D series needs right now.\n\nThe post Bowser trying to impress elephant Peach is what I needed to get me through a Wednesday appeared first on Destructoid.",

This round comes in the form of photos from the publisher's official Nintendo Tokyo Twitter account, and the store really sells itself at this point.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to Mario-laden structures like a giant pipe (complete with Mario's head coming out of it) and a classic \"Mario stage\" motif, there are decals for Zelda, Animal Crossing, Pikmin (which I almost missed!), and Splatoon adorning the windows. While three of the four photos showcase the impressive and thematic outside of the store, one of them gives us a look at the merch that will presumably be on sale\n\n\nAt a glance, we spot:\n\n\n\nGiant pipe statues\n\n\nPlush mushrooms and Mario characters/enemies\n\n\nT-shirts\n\n\nBags\n\n\n\nNintendo also gave us an official blog post, with a preview of more merch.\n\n\nIt's not going to be an all-comers situation though, at least at first.

          "description": "PS Plus Premium members are getting a neat extra perk for their subscription. Sony announced on PlayStation Blog that cloud streaming is coming for select PS5 titles later this month.  \n\n\nThese titles range from ones available on the PlayStation Plus catalog to digital purchases already in users' libraries and Game Trials. Supported titles range from the Resident Evil 4 remake to free-to-play games like Genshin Impact. In-game purchases are also available for streaming, which Sony compares to purchases from downloaded games.\n\n\nSome PS5 cloud streaming features include playing at up to 4K with HDR and access to the console's audio capabilities. Video capture is also available for up to 3 minutes along with screenshots.\n\n\nPS5 cloud streaming will launch worldwide in phases based on the region. Japan will receive the feature first on October 17 before reaching Europe on October 23. North America has the latest launch on October 30. The feature will only be available on PS5 consoles at launch.\n\n\nCloud streaming their games is a neat perk to the service for anyone with PS Plus Premium and is low on storage. Even with the PS5 Slim's 1TB of storage, many modern games are exorbitantly big, so being able to stream them could potentially mitigate storage issues at least a bit.\n\n\nWhether PS5 cloud streaming adds substantial value to PS Plus Premium is up to the individual player. Game Trials potentially benefit from this since they are more or less extended demos, meaning far less time investment. Even so, PS cloud streaming can be spotty even with great internet. \n\n\nHopefully, any benefits from streaming PS5 titles will outweigh the cons that come with it. Its use will vary with each subscriber's internet speed, but ideally, it helps avoid lengthy download times.\n\nThe post PS5 cloud streaming goes live this month for PS Plus Premium appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Sony has announced what games are being added to their various PlayStation Plus tiers this month, and buried with the rest of their Classics Catalog additions is I.Q. Final. It will be arriving on October 17.\n\n\nI.Q. Final is the sequel to 1997’s I.Q.: Intelligent Qube, which you may remember from PS1 demo discs. It’s a fantastic little game that presents a great challenge, terrific music, and a tremendous blow to your self-esteem. It has you dropping bomb tiles to try and clear a path through a rolling stack of blocks. Don’t blow up the forbidden tiles, though. Each one you accidentally destroy drops a row from the platform you’re standing on, which dwindles throughout, drastically cutting down the time you have to surgically clear a path through the blocks.\n\n\nThe 1998 sequel was never released in North America. It was released in Japan as Kurushi Final: Mental Blocks and Europe as I.Q. Final. Even with its various PlayStation Network releases, it never made it over here. The sequel comes with four modes: 100 Attack, Survival, Create, and Final. 100 Attack has you take on individual puzzles, Survival is an endless mode, and Final is the classic design.\n\n\nI recently discovered the greatness of I.Q.: Intelligent Qube. After I completed it, I then immediately researched where I could go next, only to find none of the sequels came to North America. This includes 2000’s I.Q. Remix+ and 2006’s I.Q. Mania. So, finally getting I.Q. Final is an absolute treat.\n\n\nUnless they leave it in PALs 50hz format. And unless they make it only available to Premium subscribers. I have to admit, Sony has a great vector on hurting my feelings.\n\n\nI.Q. Final joins the PlayStation Classics Catalog on October 17.\n\nThe post I.Q.

This set involves a bunch of horror games, just in time for Hallowe’en. It's definitely not a bad mix, but the Classic Catalog line-up is anemic, as usual. On the other hand, I'm surprised by one particular game's inclusion.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nHere are the titles joining Extra and Premium:\n\n\n\nAlien: Isolation\n\n\nGotham Knights\n\n\nHouse of Ashes\n\n\nOutlast 2\n\n\nDisco Elysium: The Final Cut\n\n\nDead Island: Definitive Edition\n\n\nElite Dangerous\n\n\nFar: Changing Tides\n\n\nGungrave G.O.R.E.\n\n\nEldest Souls\n\n\nRoki\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Classic Catalog additions are as follows:\n\n\n\nTekken 6 (PS3)\n\n\nSoulcalibur: Broken Destiny (PSP)\n\n\nApe Escape Academy (PSP)\n\n\nI.Q. Final (PS1)\n\n\n\nThis certainly is a decent bunch of additions, but with the recent PlayStation Plus price hike, there’s no way I’ll be touching the Extra and Premium tiers. Even the Classic Catalog additions are better than the usual fare, with I.Q. Final being an especially interesting addition. I can only hope that the PS1 and PSP titles are available piecemeal, which is never guaranteed with Sony.\n\n\nAs for new games, Alien: Isolation is one of my favorite horror games. Elite Dangerous is a rather robust space exploration game from a legendary series. Disco Elysium is one I haven’t gotten around to because I’m afraid it might be too depressing for my mindset. Meanwhile, I really don’t like Dead Island.

          "description": "Destiny 2's Season 22 story is just about complete. With the formal weekly story updates culminating in a finale for Week 7, all that remains, barring any substantial deviations from the norm, are a few audio logs, lore entries, and a final activity in the Imbaru Engine. But instead of a satisfying conclusion to the suspense that had been building even before the Season of the Witch began, players got a confusing mess of a cutscene that prompted more questions than it provided answers. Perhaps worst of all, critical narrative-moving events occur directly after the depicted scene, partially nullifying the finale's cinematic. However, that vital information lives only in lore pages that most players will never see.\n\n\nSeason of the Witch begins where the preceding Season of the Deep ended. Pl…",

          "description": "Alan Wake 2 is almost upon us. After 13 years, fans will soon experience the sequel to the cult horror Xbox 360 hit. If you're excited about the game, would you be interested in a free copy? Let me rephrase: would you be interested in a free copy if you're already purchasing a new graphics card?\n\n\nThat's what Nvidia is currently offering, at least. If you're in the market for some current-gen graphical firepower, and you want some survival horror goodness to go with it, you can get Alan Wake 2 free with purchases of select GPUs.\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the Nvidia website, you'll be eligible if you buy an RTX 4070, 4070 Ti, 4080, and 4090 (if you feel like splashing out). It's not just PCs, either. A laptop powered by the mobile versions of the 4070, 4080, and 4090 graphics chips also qualify.\n\n\nT's and C's apply\n\n\nNvidia is offering this bundle until November 13, so you have a couple of weeks after the game comes out to take advantage of it. Of course, not everyone can afford brand-new hardware right now, but if you are looking to upgrade, this might be an enticing offer. Do check the site for full terms and conditions, though.\n\n\nAlan Wake 2 is also one of the few games that features version 3.5 of Nvidia's DLSS upscaling tech. As such, it kind of makes sense that Team Green would want to partner with developer Remedy Entertainment.\n\n\nAs for the game itself, we're fast approaching spooky season, so horror is going to be everywhere by the time Halloween rolls around. Fans of the original are no doubt looking forward to the much-anticipated sequel. Hell, even I'm keen to check it out, and I wasn't a huge fan of Alan Wake to begin with.\n\nThe post You can get Alan Wake 2 for free, but you have to buy an Nvidia 4000 GPU appeared first on Destructoid.",

But it's not alone; the Legend of Zelda series, which started around that time, also remains a genre leader all these decades later. During our discussions with Nintendo during our Super Mario Bros. Wonder cover story (and other interviews earlier this year), we tried to drill into why these franchises – in particular, the Mario franchise – have maintained their popularity and level of quality while so many other series have struggled to hold onto it for even a fraction of the time.\nAccording to Mario series producer Takashi Tezuka, the tenure of the staff involved is a key part of keepin…",

Unlike Assassin's Creed Origins, Odyssey, and Valhalla, in which Basim is featured, Mirage is a smaller, more condensed adventure, unlike the prior open-world RPGs. Now, roughly a week later, Ubisoft has revealed that Mirage's player count is in line with Origins and Odyssey.

Both the disc drive model and the digital model will be updated, but these two models aren't as different as they used to be: you will now be able to purchase a disc drive separately, allowing you to upgrade a digital model to a disc-compatible version. Both versions will be available this November, and will eventually replace the current model of PS5 altogether.\n\"The new PS5 has been reduced in volume by more than 30%, and weight by 18% and 24% compared to the previous models,\" the PlayStation blog post reads. It also mentions that the new covers have different textures, which isn't immediately clear from the pictures. \"There are four separate cover panels,\" it says, \"with the top portion in a glossy look, while the bottom remains in matte.\" This does raise questions about the compatibility of console shells Sony currently sells that allow you to change the look of your console, but this question is not addressed in the announcement.\nThe slim PS5 with a disc drive will still cost $499.99. The PS5 digital edition retails at $449.99, a $50 increase from the original digital edition. \nIf you do buy a newer digital version and decide to upgrade it to a disc version, the drive will cost you $79.99 in the US, €119.99 in Europe, £99.99 in the UK, and ¥11,980 in Japan. The total cost of a digital console and a disc drive is a little more expensive than buying a disc drive version outright. The console will include a new horizontal stand to set the console on its side, and a vertical stand will be on sale for $29.99 USD | 29.99 EURO | 24.99 GBP | 3,980 JPY. You can watch the reveal trailer below:\n\n\nFor more PlayStation 5 news, read about how president Jim Ryan is stepping down, read our list of top 5 PlayStation 5 games, and check out our gameplay breakdown for the PS5 exclusive Marvel's Spider-Man 2.\nAre you interested in this newest model of the console?

It's a free-to-play shooter that features factions from different Ubisoft properties, like Splinter Cell, Watch Dogs, The Division, and Far Cry. We went hands-on with XDefiant earlier this year and came away impressed with the shooter. Players enjoyed an open beta back in June, and the full game was set to launch in the summer, but now, developer Ubisoft San Francisco has delayed its preseason launch indefinitely. \nThe team announced this on Twitter yesterday, revealing that the recent Public Test Session was a success but highlighted some inconsistencies in the game experience it wants to address before the preseason launch. As such, the preseason launch has been delayed to a later unspecified date. \nHere's Ubisoft's full statement on the XDefiant preseason launch delay: \nAn update on XDefiant- pic.twitter.com/3orSnspmp6\nOctober 9, 2023\nAs you can see, Ubisoft doesn't indicate when to expect the Preseason launch to happen, making this an indefinite delay. \nIn the meantime, watch Game Informer's XDefiant New Gameplay Today and then read our XDefiant impressions after going hands-on with the game earlier this year. \nHave you played XDefiant?

          "description": "Microsoft's long journey to acquire gaming giant Activision Blizzard is finally nearing an end. According to The Verge, a source familiar with Microsoft's plans indicated that it was aiming for Friday, October 13, as a date to close the deal. Ignoring the infamy of the date (it seems Microsoft and Activision Blizzard executives aren't very superstitious), it's not a surprising day to choose. Back in July, the two parties in the deal jointly agreed to extend the deadline of their agreement to October 18 in order to sort out any further regulatory concerns. At the time of publishing, that date is only twelve days away, so the deal would have to be closed soon.\nStill, the Microsoft legal department will have to deal with a few more legal challenges before they're completely out of the woods. After restructuring the terms of the merger to grant Ubisoft the rights to stream Activision Blizzard games in the UK, the Competition and Markets Authority granted the deal a preliminary approval, but the regulator still has to make a final assessment sometime before October 18. Still, Microsoft and Activision Blizzard each took this as a major win.\nWe are encouraged by this positive development in the CMA’s review process. We presented solutions that we believe fully address the CMA’s remaining concerns related to cloud game streaming, and we will continue to work toward earning approval to close prior to the October 18…\nSeptember 22, 2023\nThis news followed the companies' victory over the Federal Trade Commission back in July. At this point, it seems fairly likely that the deal will go through, ending a saga that began almost two years ago. After documents from the hearings leaked and revealed Microsoft's hybrid console, a new Xbox model, and plans to acquire other companies like Sega and Bungie, Microsoft is probably ready to leave the entire matter behind it.\n[Source: The Verge]\nHow do you feel about the acquisition coming to a close?

In his tweet, he writes that \"Telltale laid most of us off in early September,\" and that the layoffs occurred weeks after the company acquired U.K.-based studio, Flavourworks, which developed Erica. \nThis is a sore subject, but I feel it necessary to add to the gaming layoff news: Telltale laid most of us off early September.

The Pale Reach is Dredge's first DLC, and it launches in just over a month. For more on The Pale Reach, check out the reveal trailer below.\n\n\nSet in icy waters, the DLC will include \"1-3 hours of content\" and is accessible at any point during a playthrough of the game. In addition to a new side story, the expansion will add 11 more fish and crab species to the world of Dredge, allow you to craft a ship add-on to break through small icebergs in the water, and add ice blocks to extend the shelf-life of some of your catches. The trailer also features new monsters, like a massive icy crab and a four-legged narwhal-like creature. The Pale Reach will be available to purchase on November 16, and Dredge is available on all major platforms. \nFor more Dredge, check out this episode of the GI show.

From the acclaimed anime Cyberpunk: Edgerunners to the 2.0 update of 2077 and the release of Phantom Liberty, public perception of the series has largely turned around. Today, CD Projekt Red announced that they're taking the next step with the franchise – creating a live-action production.\nThe game studio is partnering with Anonymous Content, a media company known for its work on shows like Mr. Robot and films like The Revenant. The project will be produced by Garrett Kemble, David Levine, Ryan Schwartz, Bard Dorros, and Charlie Scully, who will develop the project \"in close collaboration with the Cyberpunk 2077 creative team.\" That said, this is still in the earliest stages; there's still no screenwriter attached to the project.\nThere are still many questions in the air about the project. They've yet to announce (and perhaps, decide) whether it will be a film or a series. And while the project is \"set in the world\" of Cyberpunk 2077, there are a lot of approaches they could take. No actors have been attached to the project either, so whether Keanu Reeves or Idris Elba will show up is still up in the air. You can read the full press release here.\nFor more Cyberpunk, here's what we thought of the latest expansion, Phantom Liberty, and here's a list of tips and tricks to help you get started.

Now, as part of Atari's Recharged lineup, it has revealed Berzerk: Recharged, and its coming to consoles and PC later this year. \nThe original Berzerk is an arcade game released in 1980. In it, players controlled a top-down avatar while shooting through hordes of armed robots in an electrified maze. The big bad was Evil Otto, who bounced around the maze as a giant smiley face, hunting players down.

However, the teaser doesn't reveal exactly what to expect in terms of Lego sets or when we might see this collaboration hit store shelves.\nThe tweet accompanying the teaser says, \"Welcome to...LEGO Animal Crossing!\" The video itself shows Isabelle and Tom Nook looking up at the Lego Animal Crossing sky before pulling out to show even more Animal Crossing characters. All of them are watching a gift rise into the sky by way of a balloon, in classic Animal Crossing fashion; somebody get them a slingshot or two. \nCheck out the Animal Crossing Lego teaser trailer for yourself below: \nWelcome to…LEGO Animal Crossing!#AnimalCrossing #LEGO #Nintendo pic.twitter.com/un3R7QwlRC\nOctober 5, 2023\nThis Animal Crossing collaboration with Lego isn't the first time Nintendo and Lego have worked together on Lego sets.

It did so, and while the game looked great on both consoles, it was only playable at 30 FPS. PlayStation 5 owners were left wondering if Rockstar wasn't tapping into the power of the current-gen console to bring 60 FPS to the 13-year-old game. \nNow, weeks later, Rockstar has updated the PS4 port of Red Dead Redemption and the included Undead Nightmare DLC to include 60 FPS support on PS5 via backward compatibility. It did so randomly, with a quick tweet announcing the news. \nRed Dead Redemption, including Undead Nightmare, now supports up to 60 FPS on PlayStation 5 via backward compatibility. pic.twitter.com/XMLIe6gYo4\nOctober 4, 2023\nElsewhere in the same update, Rockstar added an option to enable subtitles upon first booting the game. The update also includes general bug fixes and improvements, although Rockstar didn't list which. \nIf you bought Red Dead Redemption on PS4 recently to play on PS5, or were looking for a reason to do so, this new update that adds a 60 FPS option might be the reason you were looking for. Now, Rockstar please bring 60 FPS to Red Dead Redemption II on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. And bring 60 FPS in Red Dead Redemption to Xbox Series X/S, too. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Red Dead Redemption review and then read our column on remembering the mundane greatness of John Marston.

We knew the game was coming late this year, but now it's official: The Last Faith hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on November 15. \nKumi Souls Games announced this release date with a new gameplay trailer that you can watch below: \n\n\nIf you don't want to wait until November 15 to jump into The Last Faith, you can check it out early with a new extended demo that's available right now on Steam.

          "description": "11 Bit Studios, the developer behind This War of Mine, Frostpunk, and Children of Morta, unveiled The Alters last year. It called it a sci-fi adventure where one man is trying to survive, and hopefully get home, after a space mission goes wrong. To do so, he must rely on both himself and various copies of himself. \nToday, 11 Bit Studios released a new trailer of The Alters that gives us our first look at its gameplay, which highlights that it's a third-person, base-building survival game. The team says the story is \"driven by life-defining choices and exploring the diverse paths one could take\" after Jan crash-lands on an inhospitable planet turning toward a massive sun. \nCheck it out for yourself in The Alters gameplay trailer below: \n\n\n\"In this desperate race against time, Jan must harness local Rapidium crystals to create his many versions: the 'Alters',\" a press release reads. \"Set within an ever-moving mobile base, both teamwork and building a wide range of expertise are indispensable for survival. By selecting diverging paths for other Jans during the alteration process, they acquire distinct skill sets. They become invaluable, not only for maintaining the base, but also for tasks like cooking, crafting tools for surface exploration, and gathering essential resources.\" \n11 Bit Studios says the Alters are more than mere resources, though, as they are sentient beings with their own emotions, problems, goals, and sometimes, existential doubts about their purpose. \n\"Despite their differences, their collective goal is to escape, echoing Jan's determination to survive: I'll just do it all by myselves,\" the press release reads.\n\nThe Alters is due out on current-gen consoles and PC sometime in 2024. \nFor more, watch The Alters' reveal trailer here, and then read Game Informer's reviews of 11 Bit Studios' other games: This War of Mine, Frostpunk, and Children of Morta. \nAre you going to check out The Alters next year?

It also notes this includes software exclusive to the New Nintendo 3DS. \nThe company then answers a number of questions in an FAQ section of the announcement. It notes that Pokemon Bank will still be usable following April 2024 and that \"for the foreseeable future, it will still be possible to download update data and redownload purchased software and downloadable content from Nintendo eShop.\" \nThe fan-favorite 3DS feature, StreetPass, will fortunately still work as it uses local communication between devices, but SpotPass, which uses online communication instead, will no longer be available after April 2024. \nFor more, read Game Informer's farewell to the Nintendo Wii U eShop. \nWhat's your favorite online memory of the Wii U or 3DS?

The initial Dark Side support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC. Additionally, there are two playable demos if you want to test the game.
