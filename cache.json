Instead, we were treated to an incredibly well-crafted game that can easily stand toe-to-toe with the likes of Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon as a worthy homage to one of the most respected franchises in gaming history.\nTaking inspiration primarily from the ‘classic’ 'Vanias, Carpathian Night sees you traverse a total of 12 linear stages as either Abbot Dorin or Irina Dracul. The former wields a spear in a similar fashion to Castlevania: Bloodlines' Eric Lecarde, while the latter prefers the iconic whip. Whichever you choose, their basic eight-way directional attacks feel quite similar, though they each boast unique abilities obtained by collecting green gems littered throughout the stages.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "You Twinsum, you lose some.\nYou may not have heard of Little Big Adventure, but if you have, it’s likely you remember it fondly. It popped up on PC in the last months of 1994, then found its way to PlayStation and other platforms. It didn’t shift millions, but it gained cult status for its unique atmosphere, inventive controls, and memorable story of a despot, a rebellion, and a chosen one. Understanding Twinsen’s Quest really means understanding its origins, so it’s worth a recap.\nLittle Big Adventure was the first game from French studio Adeline Software, followed a few years later by a sequel. Developer  has brought back some of the original team for this remake — including composer Philippe Vachey, revisiting a memorable theme tune — as well as new creatives drawn from the LBA fan community. Designer Didier Chanfray has said that the Little Big Adventure series was always intended to be a trilogy: now the goal is to remake both of the original games in a modern style, before finally completing the set. Exciting stuff for long-time fans.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "I've been trying to work out if I'm keen on Soulframe only because I feel guilty about missing the boat with Warframe. I reviewed Digital Extremes' hit free-to-play shooter in 2013, back when people were still calling it a spiritual successor to the developer's boomerang-throwing action game Dark Sector. I didn't like Warframe much at the time. Think I gave it a 6/10. Warp forward a decade, and that 6/10 game has become a thriving live service phenomenon - fifteenth on the Steam Most Played charts at the time of writing, and profitable enough to spawn its own annual TennoCon expo. It's also become an intoxicating, confusing morass of dynastic sci-fantasy politicking and genre-shifting expansions, ranging from capital ship mechanics to questions of time travel, wrapped in layers of cosmetics that make Destiny look about as colourful as Gears Of War. \r\n\n\r\nI definitely didn't see all that coming. I doubt Digital Extremes saw it coming either. Warframe today feels like a lab experiment run amok. I love its appetite for novelty, but there's a lot for a returning player to catch up on and, frankly, it feels like homework. As such, I had a couple of broad motivations for playing Soulframe's pre-alpha \"prelude\": I'm keen to see what Digital Extremes can do when they aren't encumbered by 10 years of world-building, and I want to get in on the ground floor before they absolutely swamp this thing in updates.\r\n \nRead more",

The digital store was the subject of a report by the Anti-Defamation League last week, which claimed to find millions of examples of \"hateful or extremist\" language and images hosted on Steam's community. These include things like Nazi symbols in profile pictures, white supremacist slogans in group names, and yet more discriminatory spew in user posts. The senator has noticed this report, and now writes directly to Gabe Newell, demanding that Valve \"bring its content moderation practices in line with industry standards\" or risk \"intense scrutiny\" from the government.\nRead more",

That is, coming up with a set of game inputs that can win billions of possible permutations of the game, as determined by its RNG, when played simultaneously.

There I was, just starting to get to grips with the card-house-careful balance between each of its units when, bam, makers Game River dropped a Jenga block on top of it. It’s a stealth block, too. Didn’t even see it coming.\nUpdate 1.1’s new unit is the Phantom Ray, which Game River describe as \"a medium-sized aircraft with high HP that excels at striking enemies at close range with high-damage missiles\". It’s a mid-tier flier, costing 50 to unlock and 200 to field, and for that you get three of them per unit. As for default tech, you’ve got some range and fire rate unlocks, alongside an oil drop. The headliner here is the stealth buff, which cloaks the Phantom Ray by default until it attacks. When it does, it all gets a nice 40% bonus to damage.\nRead more",

Introduced on Razer’s Huntsman V3 Pro series and quickly followed by Wooting’s (functionally distinct but effectively identical) Rappy Snappy, Snap Tap is now wearing multiple names as it takes over the world of RGB peripherals, from SteelSeries’ Rapid Tap to Corsair’s FlashTap and Keychron’s... Last Keystroke Prioritisation. Which doesn’t sound as sexy, but still.\nHowever, Snap Tap is also drawing a level of ire that exceeds the usual baseline scepticism of hardware marketing. Because it enables a form of input automation – where you can quickly move in two directions by rapidly tapping one key, while holding down another – it’s considered by some as tantamount to cheating, allowing players to cross the line that divides unfair play from the accepted comforts that come with simply using a responsive Hall Effect keyboard or high-refresh-rate monitor. It’s even become a bannable offence in certain games, most notably in Counter-Strike 2.\nNeither side is backing down; in an astonishingly worded tweet, Wooting went as far as to concede Snap Tap \"should be considered cheating. But if it’s allowed, you need it.\" But do you?\nRead more",

          "description": "Well, that was quick. After artwork leaked last week for what looked very much like a remaster of classic real-time strategy Warcraft II: Tides Of Darkness, Blizzard sneakily dropped both that and a remaster of Warcraft: Orcs & Humans last night. They’re bundled together with Warcraft III: Reforged - itself with a new patch - in a 'Warcraft Remastered Battle Chest', which also includes the older versions of the first two games. The chest is available on Battle.net, where it’ll set you back £34.99 / $39.99. If you’re just after the older titles, they’re £9 / $10 and £12.59 / $15 respectively.\nRead more",

Now, though, GOG have declared a renewed focus on not just selling aged games, but on tweaking more of them to work on non-aged hardware.

You can feel some creative pride when you look down on the watery wonderland you've made with these tools. But you may also wonder if it was worth the effort.

He’s got ill designs on the world. Your Dad tried to stop him, and he died. He fell into a volcano. We absolutely can’t be having that.\nThis is, more than anything else, a game about Going On An Adventure. Well walked ground, of course, but it’s rare to see it embarked upon with such barefaced delight, or such a wholehearted commitment to going the distance. It is a very big and a very simple RPG that is as wide as an ocean and as deep as a pond; a game to curl up with and play lazily and—with some sour caveats—enjoyably, for an entire winter.\nRead more",

Young’uns these days just don’t appreciate how revolutionary it was to be able to hit a cop with a thing after he’d already fallen over. Suffice it to say I’ve got good memories of the open world series’ nascent forays into 3D, though never enough to tempt me into revisiting them, especially given the poor reception to Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition. I can sympathise. I’m annoyed just having to type a colon and a dash in the same game name.\nIf you’re in a similarly non-fussed position (I will never not be annoyed that ‘nonplussed’ doesn’t mean what it sounds like it should mean) I can’t imagine a lighting update that’s been available on the mobile versions for a while is enough to tempt you back. But what is a reporter's job if not pathetically treading water between chunklets of Grand Theft Auto news, upon the publishing of which Graham presses the button to release the nutritious pellets on which we all wholly subsist?

Created by a trio of developers including Hidden Folks designer Adriaan de Jongh, it's a world of spacey, sun-carved mountains, forests and monoliths. The towers resemble the sacred architecture of Monument Valley, and the colour scheme and general ambience remind me of Cocoon. There's a demo, if you fancy it.\n Read more",

          "description": "Nostalgia, when you think about it, is bollocks. There has never been a better time than right this second – averaged out, and despite repeated attempts to the contrary, humanity has never been healthier, freer, or more enlightened by knowledge. It’s true of games too. For every by-committee platter of passionless map markers, there are thousands of more personal, more creative, more interesting works, all adding to the decades' worth of great stuff we can still play today.\nWhat isn’t bollocks is the emotional pull that nostalgia, for all its lack of cold, hard reason, still manages to wield inside our warm, squishy brains. Hence, the centrepiece of Apex Legends’ Season 23 update is a mode that recreates the battle royale FPS as it was back in 2019, defaulting back to the original map and weapon arsenal while cutting the 26-strong legend roster to the earliest ten. It’s a Fortnite-style rolling back of the clock, and a passably enjoyable one, but also a reminder that the good old days weren’t always that good.\nRead more",

What’s interesting about this one is that vlog mainstay director Rich Alridge has brought along some new faces: battle designer Josh King and audio director Chris Goldsmith. And, yes, so no-one can accuse me of burying the lede: that audio design involved the enthusiastic, deeply disgusting slurping of porridge and yoghurt, and the jangling of real bones.

Nic clued me in on this reddit thread earlier, which cites unnamed Chinese players who've allegedly data-mined the beta's monster models, and learned that they are extremely large, encompassing hundreds of thousands of polygons.\nIf every monster in Monster Hunter Wilds were that fancy all of the time, your computer would become a volcano. As such, the game resorts to loading-on-demand systems to ensure that you only see those gorgeous details when the monsters are close by and, as the case may be, angrily sitting on you. When they're further afield, the flourishes fall away to free up memory and processing power. The popular Redditor explanation for the presence of monsters that look like Henry Moore sculpture is basically that the LOD systems are being forgetful, and neglecting to load the additional polygons at proximity.\n  \nRead more",

This latest campaign in Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 reminds me more of the forgettable Netflix shootfests that thumbnail their way across your TV screen as you try to find some gritty nothing to aid you in zoning out of life. Still, there is an anecdotal contingent of casual sofa sitters for whom Call Of Duty is the game. A balls-to-the-wall shooter to return to every winter and rinse through in a weekend. Ed has already gestured at its multiplayer, announcing: \"yup, it's COD\", like a deeply tired Captain Birdseye inspecting the day's catch, wondering when his life will change. But never mind that.

Yes. I admit it: I am a bug hypocrite, loudly extolling their virtue and beauty at a distance then getting irritated if they decide to come sit on me.\nFortunately, real time strategy Empire Of The Ants understands that the best place for insects to be is inside a screen, where they can be appreciated but cannot under any circumstances touch you. It’s out this week, as it happens, and here’s a new launch trailer to celebrate. Follow your pheromone trail to the video below.\nRead more",

          "description": "Early reactions to Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 multiplayer range from frothing dislike through omnimovement hype to our own Ed Thorn's dead-eyed appraisal that it's \"a good one, I think. Not a bad one. If you like Call Of Duty, you will like this. If you don't like Call Of Duty, you will not like this.\" I feel like we need to emergency-deploy a supply crate of smelling salts, because the sheer OK-ness of Black Ops 6 appears to have tumbled Ed into a stupor. \r\n\n\r\nPerhaps it would be a different story if he'd encountered some of the spawning issues and glitches people are talking about, with players joining games and materialising right into a hail of fire. The players in question include Black Ops 6's developers, who comically note in the latest Black Ops 6 patch notes that \"Yes, we saw ourselves in a Killcam before selecting a Loadout too.\" The latest patch seeks to address this, naturally. As regards the campaign side of things, it also resets your safehouse currency to 5000, if you've had your single player funds stolen (or multiplied) by technical gremlins.\r\n \nRead more",

What little roleplaying it does offer revolves around what flavour of supportive hero you prefer, and you can count the number of impactful dialogue decisions on a three-fingered hand. This might sound utterly damning in the wake of Baldur's Gate 3’s incredible reactivity, and if I approached games as some sort of tedious comparative intellectual exercise rather than just, y’know, seeing how I felt about them, then I suppose it would be. Weirdly, though, the recent memory of Baldur’s Gate 3 didn’t diminish my time with Veilguard at all. It was actually the opposite: it freed Dragon Age from having to carry the torch for a certain period in Bioware’s history, and let me enjoy Veilguard for what it was.\nRead more",

          "description": "Twitch have introduced a new \"Politics and Sensitive Social Issues\" label for streams that \"focus\" on topics like \"elections, civic integrity, and war or military conflict\". As with the streaming giant's existing labels for M-rated material, sexual themes or depictions of gambling, the idea is that viewers can filter out such streams in advance by altering their settings.\nAdvertisers, similarly, can \"make better choices about the content they want to advertise next to\" - in other words, pull their ads from a whole swathe of material if they don't want to be associated with anything controversial. Twitch's hope is that \"the labels will allow advertisers to have more context to inform which types of streams they show their ads alongside, which we expect to increase brands’ confidence in running ads on Twitch, and could bring new advertisers to our service.\"\n  \nRead more",

          "description": "The mystery surrounding Deadlock, Valve’s work-in-progress MOBA shooter, has largely evaporated. Its freely extendable invite system is about as effective at controlling player headcount as a disinterested football steward, meaning pretty much anyone with a clued-in Steam friend can get in and start poking around its secrets. And yet, being a lane-pushing wizard fighter in the Dota 2 vein, it’s already a vast tangle of interplaying abilities, items, strats, and often unspoken rules, of the kind that even experienced gankists will take hundreds of hours to learn. It’s been too much for poor Brendy, at any rate.\nStill, Brendy is but one man. What if we had but four men, working in tandem to crush lanes and flatten Patrons just as Gabe intended? To find out if Deadlock is indeed more comprehensible as a team sport, Graham, Ed, Ollie, and James joined forces, promptly getting fucked up yet emerging from the warlock hospital with a deeper understanding of its workings. Or, at least, if anyone would keep playing.\nRead more",

Bugs and maddening enemy spawns diminished the tension of being a fleshy human scavenger in a mech battlefield. But one feature annoyed some players much more - fresh water. See, you need to keep your headquarters stocked with water, as it gets steadily used by your settlement's inhabitants. The catch being that this water diminishes even while you're not playing the game. If it runs out completely, then everything you've collected gets wiped. The developers have listened to complaints about this most Farmville of mechanics, and they've answered in an interesting way. Water thieves!

It's no doubt built a compelling universe filled with brain-sucking aliens that masquerade as humans, and it attempts plenty else besides: bouncing between bodies as you stealth around dingy apartment blocks, fighting with blood katanas, and gorging on pools of red plasma to refuel skills, many of which require more body-flitting.

          "description": "Nintendo Online is currently offering an amazing deal as part of the Japanese giant's Black Friday offerings. You can practically reduce your expense by half. However, it's not a direct 50% discount, and there's a caveat—you'll need a friend to join the party.\n\n\nThe latest offering is available for both the individual membership and the one with the Expansion pack. The terms on both offers are pretty much the same, although the one with the Expansion Pack is far more expensive. Nevertheless, you and your friend can get 50% savings on an annual membership by availing of the offer before December 1.\n\n\nNintendo Online's discount is a must-buy\n\n\nUsually, an offer of a 50% discount on any annual membership is excellent, and Nintendo Online is almost a mandatory item to get if you own a Switch. The option with Expansion Pack includes several paid DLCs as well, making it even better (although the price is higher).\n\n\n\n\nIf you purchase any of the two 12-month subscription tiers, you'll have to pay the full price. However, you'll be mailed a code within 72 hours of your purchase. This code will duplicate your purchase for your friend, allowing them to get 12 months of subscription.\n\n\nHence, you and your friend can prepare this arrangement and then split the bills. Alternatively, it could be a perfect gift for a loved one who has recently joined the Nintendo ecosystem. With the festive season coming very soon, this discount is a great choice.\n\n\nNote that the discount is available only once per user, but it's also available for existing members. In other words, you'll get the benefits if you're an old customer who wants to extend his membership. The additional code will be identical to the subscription you get. If you choose to pay extra to get the membership with the Expansion Pack, the code will also reflect the same.\n\nThe post Nintendo Online’s Black Friday discount slashes price by half, but with caveats appeared first on Destructoid.",

While the third season of the anime is yet to receive an official release date, fans can indulge in ONE's creativity through Bug Ego. It's ONE's latest manga, and it's officially coming to Shonen Jump.\n\n\nHowever, ONE is not working on the manga alone. While ONE handles the narrative, the artwork is brought to life by Kiyoto Shitara, the creator of Shinobuna! Chiyo-chan. Shonen Jump announced the series' arrival on X (formerly Twitter).\n\n\n\n\nBug Ego first had its magazine debut in Weekly Young Jump in April 2023 before transitioning to a monthly serialization in Ultra Jump in October. Both VIZ Media's Shonen Jump app and MANGA Plus are publishing the manga digitally, and four chapters are already available to read.\n\n\nMANGA Plus described the story:\n\n\n\"Kindhearted high school transfer student Hitsujiya offers to help his lonely classmate Kokudo with a few social techniques and life hacks. However, Kokudo seems to know some true hacks that can alter the very fabric of reality. But is it real? What if there’s a 1% chance that it is real? Would you try these hacks?\"\n\n\nImage via Bandai Namco\n\n\nAbout ONE\n\n\nONE is a celebrated webcomic artist best known for creating One-Punch Man. Interestingly, the version of One-Punch Man published by VIZ Media's Shonen Jump isn’t the original webcomic. Instead, it’s a polished rendition illustrated by Yusuke Murata, the artist behind Eyeshield 21. This collaboration has led to immense success, including two seasons of anime adaptations, with a third currently in production.\n\n\nONE's legacy doesn't end there. ONE is also the brilliant mind behind Mob Psycho 100, which is another critically-acclaimed series. It has received a three-season anime adaptation and even a live-action series.\n\nThe post One-Punch Man’s ONE’s new manga debuts in Shonen Jump appeared first on Destructoid.",

Usually, some games tend to have separate schedules for PC and consoles. For STALKER 2 Heart of Chernobyl, there won't be any such case. The game is going to be available on all applicable platforms at the same time.\n\n\nSTALKER 2 Heart of Chernobyl release timings\n\n\nHere are the release timings of STALKER 2 Heart of Chernobyl in different regions of the world. Note that the release date in some regions will be November 21 (mentioned by a * besides the applicable timings).\n\n\n\nAuckland: 5 a.m. NZDT*\n\n\nSydney: 3 a.m. AEDT*\n\n\nTokyo: 1 a.m. JST*\n\n\nBeijing: 12 a.m. CST*\n\n\nNew Delhi: 9:30 p.m. IST\n\n\nKyiv: 6 p.m. EET\n\n\nLondon: 4 p.m. GMT\n\n\nPrague: 5 p.m. CET\n\n\nNew York: 11 a.m. EST\n\n\nSeattle: 8 a.m. PST\n\n\nSao Paulo: 1 p.m. BRT\n\n\n\n\n\nPlayers located in any region not mentioned here can automatically find the applicable timings for their region by determining the time difference between their clock and any that are mentioned here.\n\n\nDo note that while STALKER 2 Heart of Chernobyl is available in different editions, there's no early access. In simpler words, getting a Premium version won't allow you to play earlier than the rest. It will get you some excellent in-game benefits, however, which will be incredibly beneficial for your in-game journey.\n\n\nAdditionally, there won't be any New Zealand method as well, which often allows you to play a game earlier than its release in a specific region. That method works with games that are released at midnight in a given region. That privilege won't be there for Xbox users this time around, so they're in the same boat as PC users.\n\nThe post STALKER 2 Heart of Chernobyl release time across all regions revealed appeared first on Destructoid.",

Confirmation that piracy blocking tests are now being conducted at the internet's core routers isn't a surprise. It's only the internet's spinal column, so what could possibly go wrong?\nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",

          "description": "Castle Master, the haunting conclusion to the Freescape engine saga, is now ready for public testing!\nPrepare yourself for a perilous adventure as you lower the drawbridge to enter the Castle Master’s domain. Released in 1990 by Incentive Software, Castle Master became popular for its technical innovation and challenging gameplay. The game inspired countless 3D adventure titles, and the Freescape engine itself marked a technological milestone, enabling groundbreaking object interaction and spatial puzzles.\nNotably, Castle Master was one of the first games to let you choose to play as either a prince or a princess, offering a different experience depending on your choice.\nYour mission: rescue your twin, imprisoned within the eerie depths of Castle Eternity by the evil Magister. This sprawling, foreboding castle is filled with traps, monsters, and puzzles blocking your path. Gather items, unlock doors, and solve complex riddles as you navigate the labyrinthine halls and confront the dark forces within.\nThis modern reimplementation showcases enhanced graphics using OpenGL, with initial support for the DOS and ZX Spectrum releases. If you’re eager to embark on this dark journey, a playable demo is available to test your tenacity.\nTo participate in the testing, ensure you have a daily development build. We encourage all players to submit feedback and bug reports through our issue tracker.\nWill you brave the creepy corridors of Castle Eternity and free your sibling, or will you fall victim to the Magister’s curse and join his army of enslaved spirits? The adventure awaits!\n>",

          "description": "After seven months of intense work, we are ready to announce support for a few games based on qdEngine, developed by K-D Labs.\nThe work is based on the original sources published now under GPL, although the work started a bit earlier than that. The engine supports 14 games, five of which we are announcing support for. Most of these games were released in Russian; however, there were Lithuanian, Czech, and Polish releases. The support is announced for:\nWait for it! Issue 3. Song for a Hare, (Russian: Ну, погоди! Выпуск 3. Песня для зайца, Lithuanian: Na, palauk! Zuikio dainos, Czech: Jen počkej a Píseň pro zajíce)\nMask Show (Russian: Маски-шоу)\nMarvellous Mice Adventures: Meeting Sea Rat (Russian: Три маленькие белые мышки. Визит Морской крысы, Czech: Příběhy myší rodinky I, Polish: Były Sobie Myszki Trzy: Na Spotkanie Cioci Myszy)\nThe Adventures of the Good Soldier Schweik (Russian: Похождения бравого солдата Швейка)\nMarvellous Mice Adventures: Sea Rat's Birthday, (Russian: Три маленькие белые мышки. День рождения морской крысы, Polish: Były Sobie Myszki Trzy: Urodzinowe Śledztwo)\nOther games do work; however, we haven’t playtested them. You may find more information on our Wiki. Also, we are looking for the Lithuanian version of Little Longnose and Polish releases of Little Mice games and Wait for it! game. If you happen to have a copy, please contact sev.\nWe continue the active development so that support for other games will follow shortly. The primary constraint is playtesting.\nTo run these games, you need the latest daily build of ScummVM. If you encounter any hiccups during your quests, please file them on our issue tracker.\n>",

          "description": "We are excited to announce that Rise of the Dragon  is now ready for public testing. This is the first of a small number of games built using the DGDS (Dynamix Game Development System) engine.\nThe Dynamix name may be familiar – bought by Sierra in 1990, the Dynamix brand continued and became well known for action and puzzle games like The Incredible Machine, A10 Tank Killer, and Red Baron.  They also made a few adventures using the custom DGDS engine.\nRise of the Dragon is set in Los Angeles in a dark version of the future, circa 2053.  You play as Blade Hunter, a private investigator and retired police officer.  After a designer drug kills the mayor's rebellious daughter, Chandra, Hunter is hired to find the people responsible for releasing the drug on the streets. What Blade ultimately finds is much more than he expected.  Rise of the Dragon combines classic point-and-click adventure style with platforming arcade sequences, giving a unique gameplay combination.\nYou’ll need the latest daily build of ScummVM and files from the DOS version of the game, which you can buy at GOG (check our wiki for the required data files).  Please file any issues you notice on our bug tracker.\n>",
