Merge & Blade is a hybrid between puzzle games and auto-battlers. Rounds will start with a Tetris-like mini-game, but instead of shapes, you’re guiding different unit types and merging them together. You then use your completed party to raid castles and kill monsters. Mixing - or merging - Tetris into a new genre is a recipe for success, so I’ll definitely be downloading this one.\r\n\n \nRead more",

With two campaigns spanning each side of the sunny Mediterranean, this is arguably Relic's breeziest and most colourful theatre of war yet, evoking the same kind of swagger and gung ho optimism as a Hollywood action flick. It's a feeling that might seem out of place given the current climate, especially now, just days away from the first anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But while your main objective is always one of domination, gradually turning the map from red to blue on both a micro and macro scale, this is ultimately a game about searing comebacks - of beating back seemingly impossible aggressors, and finding hope where previously there was only despair. I think we could all do with a bit of that in this day and age, even if the battles before you end up feeling like nothing more than the digital equivalent of plonking down a big box of toy soldiers on your living room floor and going daka-daka-daka as they all fall over. \nRead more",

Personally, I’m what they called a “Speccy” kid, and I have carried a deep and profound love of the elderly microcomputer’s cassette tape screeches, colour clash and long, long load times into my adult life, despite the fact that – and please don’t get upset, purists – many of the great Spectrum games don’t hold up in the cold light of the modern day. It’s not that the games are necessarily bad, more that they were tremendous for their time. Still eminently enjoyable, but they require the player to get their head into a certain zone, to put up with what are inarguably quite archaic controls and mechanics. \r\n\n\r\nOddly enough, there are some Spectrum games on Steam, thanks to a publisher called Pixel Games. However, with the utmost respect to their output… these are not the kind of games that are going to foster interest in the Speccy amongst modern players. Of course, that may well not be the point, but I’d be a little taken aback if even avowed old-school gamers were going to bother picking up the likes of gardening simulator Pedro, a game that scored 63% in Newsfield’s iconic Crash magazine back in the day, or Sam Stoat: Safebreaker, which did a little better at 68%.\nRead more",

They all force a little chuckle out of me, but none of them have made me belly laugh like I Am Jesus Christ, a first-person retelling of Christ’s tale from birth, to death, to rebirth.  \r\n\n\r\nI Am Jesus Christ’s genre is slightly murky, although, it almost looks like a giant Skyrim mod complete with unfeeling NPCs, first-person spellcasting, and an open world full of quest markers. The newest trailer shows some of Christ’s cool abilities like walking on water, shooting light beams at Satan, and fishing - which is incidentally what I’m looking forward to the most. \r\n\n\r\nIn fairness, the Christ sim looks like a pretty robust and thorough retelling of his journey, depicting scenes like the Last Supper, only this time all the disciples have exclamation marks above their heads. The Steam page also details 30 different miracles (or spells) and a number of different areas to explore. \r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Like all good fairytale characters, Pinocchio gets a revision every couple of years - except for 2022, when he was adapted thrice (mostly in bad films, except for the Del Toro one). The loveable puppet isn’t waiting too long for his next comeback, as the RPG Soulslike Lies Of P is coming to PC and Game Pass in August. \r\n\n\r\nLies Of P’s newest trailer is mostly a black screen with a lot of VO, but we get a clear look at Pinocchio's daddy Master Gepetto this time. The trailer follows a blob wobbling through very Victorian streets before it slides into some automation and uses the machine’s body as a puppet. The result is a boss-sized monstrosity that sits halfway between Lovecraftian horror and industrial defect. It also reminds me of Gears 5’s weird infected robots, with tentacles and slime hanging off their metallic arms - equally gross and cool.\r\n\n\r\nThe newest trailer doesn’t show off any Bloodborne-style combat, but we’ve had plenty of looks at that already, including a fight with a gorilla robocop. This Soulslike looks just as aggressive as you’d expect, emphasising quick dodge rolls and last-minute, anxiety-fueled parries. Pinocchio’s arm doubles up as a grappling hook to pull enemies in, which is always cool in a hack n’ slasher, and makes even more sense when you’re playing as a puppet. Also, is it just me or is Pinocchio pretty this time around?\r\n \nRead more",

Ozymandias is a bronze age 4X that builds momentum enough to turn that into \"just one more game\". It is incredibly easy to learn, and despite looking a little dry and number heavy, becomes more effortless, more pleasant the longer you play. It also becomes more clear how much depth there is hidden away in such a light design.

          "description": "I am legendary ronin Sakomoto Ryoma. I shout \"yosh!\" as I harvest six (6) gleaming radishes from my allotment. I shoot a bandit in the head with a revolver. I send my adoptive daughter to trade some homemade pickles. I partake in a brooding chat, then stamp on a dude's head. I help a recluse regain his confidence. I have totally forgotten what I was meant to be doing.\nLike A Dragon: Ishin feels like a step backward, but in a brilliant way. Kiryu and co. may have moved onto a turn-based future, yet Sakomoto Ryoma and his pals have turned back the clock to an Edo period of brawlin' and chicken betting that's most reminiscent of Yakuza 0, only it's not the roaring 80s but the bloody 1800s. There's nothing here that will convert those who aren't keen on the series, but if you're an ardent fan or a newcomer eager to experience its wild swings between serious and silly, Ishin is an excellent place to start.\nRead more",

Unlike some games, Veil Of Dust doesn't make it sound like any sort of concession; the middle difficulty is called Challenge, and says \"it's pretty tough - you've been warned\". I took the warning seriously, and thank God, because even the easiest difficulty had me pouring dandelion tea down my brother's throat like he was doing a kegstand (and in the game).\nÁine and Shane are a pair of Irish siblings who've moved to Oregon to start a new life, which, in the main story, involves eating potatoes and trying not to get depressed. It's difficult enough that I didn't think I would like it at first, as even basic tasks deplete your stamina and sleeping in your 1860s hovel with a hole in the roof doesn't restore very much per night. Áine can do spells, but they're simple and only really take the edge off what is a very hard life. Magic isn't a cure-all in Veil Of Dust, and using it has to be weighed up, just like everything else.\nRead more",

I can barely see three feet in front of my nose because of the thick blanket of fog, but I'm trying my hand at night fishing, hoping to hook something really good. I find a squid spot and start to fish, reeling in one or two fine-looking catches. The third one, however, is monstrous, a mess of jagged teeth and sickly pale flesh. Yes, this should make for a fine amount of cash. The more morbid it is, the more money I get. Suddenly there’s a deep rumbling in the ocean and panic starts to creep in. I chuck my prize into my cargo and speed back to town, the phrase ‘fuck round, find out’ circling my brain.\nI’ve not been playing Dredge long, but I’m calling it one of my favourite games of the year, right now, in February. Black Salt Games' sinister fishing RPG is gripping and enchanting in a way I didn’t anticipate. I’ve spent hours exploring its murky waters and my constant shock at what unsettling creatures my hook brings in is seemingly never-ending. Its eldritch world keeps pulling me back with its mystery and malevolent horror, and its sense of atmosphere and tension is incredible. Basically, I'm completely enraptured, hook, line, sinker. Dredge already feels like one of this year’s greatest indie horrors and all this, from a fishing game of all things.\nRead more",

I’ve put together this settings guide – based on the game’s early trial build – for those who want to join the hunt pronto, but above all else my advice is to wait until developers Omega Force get the promised performance improvements up and running. From what I’ve played, Wild Hearts’s bad shape is doing an otherwise enjoyable Monster Hunter-like a huge disservice.\nRead more",

But that’s the fate of deep-space astronaut Selene in Returnal, when she ditches her single-seater vessel on a remote rock called Atropos. Each time she falls foul of the local fauna, she pops back into existence right next to her broken ship, with no obvious means of escape. Forget Aliens vs Predator, this is Aliens vs Groundhog Day.\nBut what a day it is, as Returnal combines a best-in-class third-person shooter with a deep dive into the psychology of its protagonist. Selene’s journey into Atropos, through a thick jungle, a burning vermilion desert and beyond, sends her circling through a smorgasbord of emotions – from confusion to hope, despair to determination. And so often, her mood dovetails with your own highs and lows of elation and frustration, until every part of Returnal encases you in its loop.\nRead more",

It was one of that era's City Building series that included Zeus and all of the Caesars, a run of games so good that they earned the capital letters. Pharaoh also happens to be one of my foundational video games, and I played it when I was knee-high to my big brother's desk, at a time when family homes had one (1) yellow-grey computer with a CRT screen. And now it's back, baby.\nPharaoh: A New Era means I can play that game of my childhood on my shiny black RGB-lit bastard. Honestly though, the \"A New Era\" part is a bit much. Sure, the updated graphics are fabulous and the quality of life changes mean it plays like smooth peanut butter to the 90s' extra crunchy.

These drives are hard to go back to after you're used to SSDs, with their near-instant access times, completely silent operation, resistance to shocks, drops and magnets and of course their overall SPEED. \nSo when I had the chance, I bought the biggest SSD I could afford, a 4TB model at the time, and copied literally every bit of data from the four or five 1TB or smaller hard drives that I'd bought over the years and stuck into my increasingly full PC tower. It was expensive, and it took ages to copy everything across, but as soon as I turned my computer on for the first time and I didn't have to listen to the clicks and whirs of a mechanical drive, I was completely convinced I'd made the right call to ditch spinning rust.  \nRead more",

In fairness, though, co-op adventure Blanc looks like it's going to be a lot lighter than games like Endling: Extinction is Forever and the notoriously upsetting Shelter series at first glance, but I’ve learned to never let my guard down around these kinds of games. Those cute art styles are almost always a front for a brutal sneak attack on your emotions.\nBlanc is very much aiming for your heartstrings with its adorable animal duo and picturesque snowy landscapes. The first half teases massive potential for a cutesy story with fun puzzle antics, but the game is majorly let down by a repetitive and often frustrating second half and lacklustre ending. After the promise of a warm, cosy adventure, I watched the end credits roll and couldn't help feeling like I'd been left out in the cold.\nRead more",

And I'm guessing it wants players to experience the joys of shredding goons, and a story told through unpredictable cuts to karaoke and anime. I'm sad to report that it isn't any of these things. Aside from the tiniest glimpses of cool when a combo comes together, the game clearly doesn't know what it wants to be, or if it did once upon a time, its original vision must've gotten lost under a dogpile of ideas. I rooted for it when I first saw it way back when, and got excited when I heard it was being made by devs behind Ninja Gaiden and Dead or Alive, but what's arrived is a jumbled mess that fights you at every turn. If I were Debra Meadon playing it for the first time live on Dragon's Den, and someone sidled up behind me and pressed a katana to my throat, I would still carefully put the controller down and say, \"It's a no from me\".\nRead more",

And, since an Ordinary (non-magical person) suddenly getting magic is also deemed weird in Ikenfell, it stands to reason that it’s practically guaranteed to happen. We can only assume the odds become even higher as the Ordinary ventures closer to the big magical fantasy school, which protagonist Maritte quickly discovers. Upon approaching the gate in search of her missing sister, Safina, Maritte suddenly starts to sling fiery spells.\nThose new spells certainly come in handy, as Maritte finds herself fired up (hehe, geddit?) and ready to fight through this Paper Mario-style tactical RPG. Along with some of Saf’s old friends, you explore the titular school and surrounding areas, searching for clues that might help unravel the mystery. Ikenfell has challenging combat and lots of little secrets hidden in its 8-bit world, but it’s the loveable bunch of pals (both allies and rivals) that really made me smile. Oh, and some of them have killer theme tunes that I can’t stop singing.\nRead more",

Later Alligator is one such game I picked up for that very reason as the goofy gators in the game’s trailer and screenshots initially caught my attention. The animation is great for sure, but one thing I was not expecting is how funny and utterly charming this point-and-click adventure is.\nRead more",

          "description": "Too many spells in games are just variations on the old reliable fireball. Wizard sends projectile towards target. Target dies. Perhaps they deviate a little in how quickly they die, or how large the area of effect is. Maybe instead of a fireball it's a thunderbolt, or a poisonous gas, or a beam of light. Pish, I say. Pish! Where's the real magic? Where are the cataclysmic spells that take days or weeks of preparation, and then change the world with a single fateful ritual?\nThese games could learn something from The Last Spell, a roguelite turn-based tactics game about defending your village each night from hordes of mutant beasts that emerge from the purple fog surrounding the entire world. Whenever I start a new game in The Last Spell, I always rewatch the excellent opening sequence, which succinctly sets a harrowing scene of magic pushed further than we're used to seeing in most fiction in general, let alone games.\nRead more",

          "description": "Have you ever planned to do a bunch of personally improving stuff on a Sunday morning like go for a walk down to the old pier or read 30 pages of an extremely political sci-fi book about aliens made of wool, but what you do instead is sit on the sofa playing an aggressively monetised mobile game while repeats of Modern Family run on the TV? For six hours, you do this, and eat your dinner feeling sick with unrealised potential.\nMatch-3 games are compulsive for a reason, and I don't have beef with them as a concept. I actually like them! But I don't like that to play a match-3 game I usually have to play a mobile game that wants me to spent money on Fairy Dollars so I can buy barrels of Explosive Wand Dust, making it easier to earn stars and incrementally furnish the Magic Toilet Goblin's bedroom, or whatever. It's the empty consumerism vibe of freemium mobile games that makes me feel like I've been eating the time-spending equivalent of junk food. Spirit Swap, which has a demo out now in the form of an endless mode, isn't that. It's beautiful, difficult, customiseable, and it'll swallow you time in a good way, not a faintly unsettling one.\nRead more",

It’s time for a new episode of the Spot Dodge Podcast exclusively on Destructoid. Topics: Tonight we’ll be talking all about the upcoming Pokemon Presents. Along with that, a war still wages between Sony and Microsoft regarding acquiring Activision-Blizzard. A deal that will have huge ramifications across the industry, even for Nintendo. As Microsoft has signed an agreement with Nintendo to release Call of Duty and other \"Xbox games\" on Nintendo platforms. So much to talk about!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G44xNUznQS4&ab_channel=Destructoid\nThere's a high chance we get our first look at the next major Pokemon game during this week's Pokemon Presents. One area I really hope the following games are improved in is the performance. Pokemon Scarlet and Violet are still riddled with bugs and performance issues which is a shame, as they're great games to their core. Lastly, Pokemon titles are sorely missing from the latest Nintendo Switch Online announcement regarding Game Boy and Game Boy Advance games coming to the service. Tonight on Spot Dodge we'll talk all about Pokemon in 2023.\nSpot Dodge is a weekly Nintendo-focused Podcast here at Destructoid where we dedicate an hour or two to go over the latest Nintendo news and discuss the games we’re playing. If you’re a fan of Nintendo Switch, RPGs, or having a good time, Spot Dodge will be a great addition to your podcast rotation. So be sure to subscribe!\nSpot Dodge is streaming live every Tuesday at 4:00 p.m. PT / 7:00 p.m. ET on Twitch channel. ICYMI: We now have a dedicated Spot Dodge YouTube channel for our archived streams! All future episodes will be uploaded there.\nAfterward, the show will be available on-demand for audio listeners via Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and more. The live video version will remain on Twitch until  (don’t forget to follow and subscribe). So many options!\nThe post What we want from Pokemon in 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Marie's goal? Make an item within five years that will appease her teacher. But that's easier said than done.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38j5TByJ0nM\nGathering and collecting alchemy materials, and then synthesizing them into items, is a core part of the story. You can fulfill requests for those in the town, upgrade your atelier, and hire little helpers to assist. On top of this, there are some RPG battles to undertake, potentially leading to encounters with legendary monsters. Turns out magic school is pretty rough.\nAtelier Marie Remake is playable with either the story-imposed five-year time limit, or with an \"Unlimited Mode\" which turns off the time crunch. Either way, Gust's RPG gets a fresh look and a bevy of new platforms to play it on.\nStirring the pot\nAs the Atelier series grows in popularity, it's cool to see this piece of history get a refresh for modern systems. All the life sim elements may even seem more appealing to players now, who may have put a fair number of hours into games like Stardew Valley and are looking for a new RPG with similar vibes.\nIn other Atelier news, Atelier Ryza 3: Alchemist of the End & the Secret Key is due out on March 24, 2023 after taking a one-month delay to work on the game. Even with the delay, though, the upcoming spring and summer looks to have plenty for armchair alchemists to dig into.\nThe post Atelier Marie Remake sets a launch date for July 13 appeared first on Destructoid.",

A graphics support unit, the Super FX chip was a co-processor that pushed the SNES’ graphic capabilities pretty far. Games like Star Fox and Super Mario World 2: Yoshi’s Island benefitted from the tech and were able to punch above their generational weight class.\nRegardless, only Yoshi’s Island doesn’t look entirely antiquated by today’s standards. While 3D graphics were novel at the time, their mostly flat-shaded surfaces came at a tremendous price when it came to framerate.

Their last encounter resulted in them sealing each other away in the time-out corner. However, they’ve dropped a mess of leftover weapons that are sought by warriors known as Fencers. You join a fencer named Fang and his companions as they set out to find the Furies and resurrect the Goddess.\n[embed]https://youtu.be/qUd5UloNCQQ[/embed]\nYou can expect your usual slate of TRPG mechanics, such as terrain modifiers, buffs, and spells.

          "description": "Take the SPD and deal with it\nCapcom has begun location tests for a new virtual reality experience set within the world of its flagship fighting franchise, Street Fighter. The Street Fighter VR: The Shadaloo Enhancement Project is currently available to play in the Capcom store at Hiroshima Plaza in Hiroshima, Japan.\nThe short experience allows players to step up to the plate against long-time poster boy Ryu and Russian wrestler Zangief in first-person combat, with sound and visuals running on the same engine used for Street Fighter V. The concept sees the player take the role of a lowly Shadaloo grunt, training against two of the World Warriors that they may encounter as the evil organization attempts its takeover of the free world. Yeah... That's exactly who I want to play in VR: A nameless, nobody, Shadaloo trainee.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3rBDYNXRs&ab_channel=asciijpnews\nUtilizing PC VR hardware, players must block attacks and counter with punches and special moves, impacting certain areas on the opponent while their guard is down. A short video not only demonstrates a player throwing out an iconic Hadoken projectile, but also sees the hapless protagonist caught in Zangief's Spinning Pile Driver, which I can only assume is a VR experience likely to demonstrate the technological power of your own stomach.\n\"Stop playing if you feel sick or feel something is wrong with your body.\" reads the warning. Indeed.\nThe demo ends with hints that further characters — such as Akuma and Shadaloo leader Bison himself — will be added to the game in future updates. Capcom has not announced any plans to bring Street Fighter VR: The Shadaloo Enhancement Project to western locations, but I would not be surprised if it at least showed up at one of the booths at the big summer expos such as E3 or Summer Game Fest.\nThe post Street Fighter VR project holds location tests in Japan appeared first on Destructoid.",

A new Pokemon Presents stream has been scheduled for Feb. 27, airing at 9 a.m. ET / 6 a.m. PT.\nThe show will stream on the Pokemon YouTube channel starting at 6 a.m. PT, and will run for roughly 20 minutes.\nhttps://twitter.com/Pokemon/status/1628032454295531522\nThe stream will spotlight \"about 20 minutes of exciting Pokemon news,\" as part of the Pokemon Day 2023 celebration.\nGotta catch 'em all\nSpeculation on what could be in this Pokemon Presents is easy to center on the most recent entry, Pokemon Scarlet and Violet. Any potential DLC for the latest Pokemon generation would be interesting to see, and there are a lot of places the series could go after the events and ending of Scarlet and Violet.\nA hint of what's ahead could be interesting, though the Pokemon team has been hard at work tuning up Scarlet and Violet after it launched with a number of technical issues.\nStill, there are many other places The Pokemon Company could go for additional announcements and reveals. A new spin-off or follow-up to a cult-classic is always a welcome surprise, especially with some of the recent ones the company has put together. Is it too much to hope for Pokemon Conquest to make a comeback?\nAdd in potential updates to live-service titles like Pokemon Unite, and there's a lot the stream could hold for February 27. No matter what, I'm interested to see what the future holds for Pokemon. Last year was very Poke-heavy, as we got two big entries in the series. And with next week's stream, we might get to see what the road looks like beyond the launch of Scarlet and Violet.\nTune in for the stream on February 27 at 9 a.m. ET / 6 a.m. PT on the Pokemon YouTube channel here.\nThe post A new Pokemon Presents is on the way for February 27 appeared first on Destructoid.",

The PlayStation State of Play airs on Feb. 23 at 4 p.m. ET / 1 p.m. PT.\nThe focus for this stream looks to be third-party titles. Sony will kick things off with some looks at \"anticipated\" games from its third-party partners, including indies. Five new PlayStation VR2 titles are also due to be announced.\nThen, we'll get over 15 minutes of new gameplay details and updates on Rocksteady's upcoming Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. No estimated runtime was given, though it sounds at least somewhat lengthy from the amount of Suicide Squad alone.\nhttps://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1628077150380363777\nThe year ahead for PlayStation\nThis PlayStation State of Play is the first of the year for Sony, and looks set to spotlight what's on the way for its hardware, both in the PlayStation 5 and the imminent PlayStation VR2.\nWe've already seen 2023 kick-off streams from both Xbox and Nintendo. So with this stream, Sony is taking the opportunity to set the tone for its year ahead.\nWith that in mind, the lack of first-party games here does feel a bit surprising. We don't really know what Sony's first-party lineup looks like for 2023, outside an assumption that Marvel's Spider-Man 2 will play a part in it.\nStill, Sony State of Play streams have had some surprises before, and the third-party developers could bring some surprises. There are other games we've yet to hear more about due out later this year, including Street Fighter 6 and Final Fantasy XVI, both of which have featured in Sony's previous streams.\nPlayStation VR2 is also front-of-mind for Sony, it seems. With five games, that will make up at least a decent chunk of the stream, and probably be exciting for anyone picking up the new headset this week.

From the high street to the local school, movie theaters to woodland areas, museums to farmland — There is no part of the once-beautiful town that has not become awash with the undead and its hapless victims.

Protagonists Layla Ellison, Devinder Crousley, Jacob Boyer, and Remi de la Rosa are themselves equipped with distinct skills — from incredible feats of engineering to powerful psychokinetic abilities — all of which will no doubt come in handy as they ransack Redfall in a serious bout of exorcism, all conducted at the business end of a barrel.

The DLC adds “rogue-lite-esque” gameplay by means of a series of challenges that you’ll need to topple in a single attempt, lest you’re sent back to the beginning to start over. Unlike your typical rogue-lite, the tower isn’t randomized, and you’ll get permanent new powers as you climb higher. The tower itself is one stated to be “one huge level” with no loading zones. On top of this are new story elements with familiar and new characters.\nAlongside the DLC, Fabraz and Playtonic Friends will be holding a contest that will dole out rewards for anyone who can accomplish a variety of feats that prove they’ve got beefier thumbs than the others. This includes being the first to topple the tower, getting the fastest run to the top, or beating the tower on “hex mode.” I’ll drop the details below.\n\nI mostly let Demon’s Turf drop off my radar after my initial review of it. It just didn’t click with me. However, it did better with some people who are less curmudgeonous than I am, so if it sounds rad to you, this DLC might be the non-dairy coffee whitener that you need to give it a taste.\nDemon’s Turf is available on PC, Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, and PS5.

Street Fighter: Duel will launch with a huge roster of 40 unlockable characters, with future updates on the books.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SH9evri9ezo&ab_channel=CrunchyrollCollection\nStreet Fighter: Duel looks to offer up typical mobile action, built around leveling up characters, mashing through battles, and unlocking further characters, buffs, and abilities — punctuated by a slew of microtransactions. While the gameplay and format can be expected to be typically divisive, I do dig the cartoony alternate takes on the World Warriors' classic appearances. I'll be sure to check out the game upon launch, and we'll see whether Crunchyroll is headed for a K.O., or whether it's lining up to be another popular franchise that fails to translate to the mobile RPG market.\nStreet Fighter: Duel launches February 28 on iOS and Android. A PC and console port is planned for the summer.\nThe post Street Fighter: Duel launches on iOS and Android February 28 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Decked to the nines in a slick suit and alligator skin coat, Kazuya utilizes extended chains and impactful single strikes to knock his boy seven ways 'till Sunday, ultimately calling upon the terrifying Devil Gene in order to get the job done.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFAMYW2POBw&t=96s&ab_channel=BandaiNamcoEntertainmentAmerica\nIn addition to the Kazuya showcase, the new trailer also shows off a stunning Times Square-style battleground, awash in neon signage, theater marquees, and nightlife. The new trailer is a super showcase of the power behind Tekken 8's Gen-9-only technology, with amazing particle effects and dazzling, crisp colors. The trailer feels like a statement of intent, assuring fans that they're about to get a taste of Tekken like never before, propelling the long-life franchise into the new year and beyond.\nTekken 8 is currently in development for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X with an expected 2024 release date.\nThe post Kazuya Mishima dominates in wicked Tekken 8 trailer appeared first on Destructoid.",

Following comments from the publisher during an investor's call, Ubisoft has confirmed it will be in attendance at E3 2023.\nDuring an investor's call, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot responded to an inquiry on whether the company would be in attendance at this year's event. \"If E3 happens, we will be there and we will have a lot of things to show,\" said Guillemot at the time.\nIn a follow-up to GamesIndustry.biz, Ubisoft clarifies the wording:\n\"E3 is a special moment for our industry and we are excited to showcase our strong line-up in Los Angeles in June. We are still finalizing the details of our plans and look forward to sharing more soon.\"\n\nIt's a good clarification, at least, for those who may have thought E3 was changing things up once again following Guillemot's comment. ReedPop did reaffirm that E3 is \"full speed ahead\" after Guillemot's initial comment, but with this clarification, that's at least one company that looks set to show something in Los Angeles. [Disclosure: I was previously employed at USgamer, a former ReedPop website.]\nThe summer of games awaits\nQuestions of who's attending E3 2023 are still up in the air. An IGN report confirmed Sony, Nintendo, and Xbox wouldn't be on the show floor, though Microsoft is planning to host a summer showcase in Los Angeles.\nThe current plan has E3 2023 running from June 13 through 16 in Los Angeles, with both industry and consumer days planned.\nMeanwhile, Ubisoft says it is bringing a \"strong line-up\" to bear for its Los Angeles showing. The publisher has been on a bit of a roller-coaster, announcing a bevy of Assassin's Creed projects while also cancelling a number of unannounced projects and delaying Skull and Bones. It'll be interesting to see what it shows up with in June.\nThe post Ubisoft clarifies its E3 2023 plans appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Laser imaging, detection, and range\nSteelkrill Studios, the makers of lo-fi horror game The Backrooms 1998, have announced that they’ll be releasing The Voidness into the void of Early Access on March 17, 2023.\nThe Voidness is a unique horror game with an experimental twist. For much of the game, you’re immersed in complete darkness and are only able to perceive your surroundings with a lidar scanner. A lidar, or laser imaging, detection, and ranging scanner, is a device that uses lasers to create a constructive image of the area it’s pointed at. It has many uses, as it can create 3D maps of geographic locations and features.\n[embed]https://youtu.be/M66MeyC_gzA[/embed]\nFor The Voidness, however, lidar will be your only means of seeing what’s around you, and that includes anything that might be trying to eat you. The developer also touts that, like in The Backrooms 1998, enemies will listen in on your PC microphone. That sounds more like a feature utilized by streamers, as I don’t make it a habit of talking to my computer monitor. However, I’m always down for an experimental approach to game design.\nI haven’t personally played The Backrooms 1998, but I’ve seen it spoken of fondly in the indie horror circles I observe. It has also been picked up by popular streamers and has enjoyed it reasonable amount of success as a result. I might have to give it a good look-over once it leaves early access. The Voidness is another game to add to that list, as the developer states that its Early Access period will last anywhere from “a few months or a couple years.”\nThe Voidness will launch on PC via Steam Early Access on March 17, 2023.\nThe post The Voidness immerses Early Access March 17 appeared first on Destructoid.",

The huge prize pool is expected to see many players, perhaps even retirees, dust off the arcade stick and go for their moment of glory.\nhttps://twitter.com/StreetFighter/status/1627566668821172224?s=20\nOf course, the promotion of such a lucrative tournament also works in Capcom's favor, as it keeps hype for the new sequel high, as well as encourages large turnouts at the many events that will be held all over the globe between Street Fighter 6's launch this summer and the ultimate showdown next year. Street Fighter 6, as I have iterated many a time, is already shaping up to be a fantastic release, one that hopes to see the brand reestablish itself as the competitive fighting game.\nMe?

          "description": "Wakarimashita\nThe fan group Team K4L have announced that their translation of Kurohyou: Ryu Ga Gotoku Shinshou will be released this August. Initially, they had hoped to release it last year, but unfortunately had to delay it.\nSega has come a long way when it comes to localizing their Yakuza/Like a Dragon series, so we’ve been eating well. Like a Dragon: Ishin! was once argued by Sega as being a poor choice for localization, but despite that, we just recently finally got it over here. However, in a recent interview with The Gamer chief producer Hiroyuki Sakamoto said of Kurohyou, “I think if we wanted to develop something, we're not really looking at the past, we're looking to the future, and we think that we want to put our efforts and our priorities at making new titles for Like a Dragon.” That’s not a “no, definitely not,” but it’s not looking good, so it’s always great to see fans step in to bring a title to a wider audience.\n[embed]https://youtu.be/dkkGKxAhNr0[/embed]\nKurohyou: Ryu Ga Gotoku Shinsho is a 2010 spin-off of the series for PSP. Rather than an attempt to simply transplant the Like a Dragon/Yakuza formula to the portable, Sega enlisted AKI Corporation (now known as syn Sophia) to put their own spin on it. AKI should be a familiar name to anyone who played N64 wrestling games, as they’re the developers behind WCW/NWO Revenge and WWF No Mercy. These titles, as well as the others they put out on the console, are still regarded as some of the best pro wrestling games ever released.\nThe gameplay focuses more on one-on-one combat, but the narrative features the familiar neighborhood of Kamurocho and is packed with mini-games and side quests. Combat is modeled closer to Def Jam Fight for NY, rather than the more beat-’em-up brawling of your typical Yakuza/Like a Dragon game.\nK4L will be releasing the translation patch this August under the name Kurohyou (Like a Dragon: Black Panther).\nThe post Kurohyou Like a Dragon: Black Panther fan translation coming in August appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It's been a year and a half since release\nIf you missed Monster Hunter Stories 2 when it came out in mid-2021, I don't blame you. There's a host of reasons why a lot of folks skipped out on it, but the good news is that Capcom is permanently reducing the price of the game: which will also impact the aftermarket.\nAnnounced openly on Twitter, Capcom had this to say:\n\"Ride on! Grab Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin for #NintendoSwitch and PC/Steam at a new price of $39.99. Start your journey today with the demo and transfer your progress over to the full game.\"\n\nThat price is already reflected in the digital edition of the game on both Switch and Steam. Note that there is a \"Digital Deluxe Edition\" though, which is now $50. The new $40 standard isn't present everywhere though, as a search through various digital storefronts came up with a $60 digital voucher code price. Keep that in mind if you're ever shopping for the game! It'll take a bit for everything to really sink in everywhere, but used copies are already dropping to $30 and below in some marketplaces (like Amazon).\nThere's also the chance that Monster Hunter Stories 2 will be part of the ever-present Capcom sale periods, so you could get it for even cheaper. In this economy, it goes without saying that we could use more price drops.\nThe post Monster Hunter Stories 2 is now officially $40, if you were on the fence appeared first on Destructoid.",

We won't be sharing any links or posting any of the leak here, though we've taken a look ourselves to verify its existence.\nWithout divulging any details, it does look like the art book for the upcoming Breath of the Wild sequel. And the nice part is, from a cursory scan, nothing jumped out as an obvious spoiler. Still, it's worth being aware that this info is out there, in case you want to go into Tears of the Kingdom as fresh as possible.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYZuiFDQwQw\nArt of the kingdom\nIt's especially interesting that an art book would leak so far ahead of the release date. We're still a ways out from Tears of the Kingdom's release date of May 12, 2023. This art book is part of what's included in the collector's edition of the game. It is strange that so much info would make it out from the book, three months ahead of time.\nStill, fans are likely hungry for more information, as it feels like we don't know a ton about this new Zelda. Points like the main antagonist, or the reason why Hyrule is now home to so many floating islands, are all still theories at this time. I'm sure fans are likely to pick this Zelda art book apart looking for any info on what could be arriving in May.\nIn the meantime, rev up those muted keywords and hashtags if you're looking to avoid all of it. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom arrives on May 12, 2023.\nRelated: Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom will be 38 percent bigger than BOTW as file size revealed on Dot Esports\nThe post Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom art book has leaked online appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Kiss the moons\nRoughly a year after launching Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition, Square-Enix has circled back to address some of its glaring issues with a patch this month. The patch is expected to address issues relating to the title's frame rate, tweak the growth system for Pip, and fix numerous bugs.\nChrono Cross was the anticipated sequel to the SNES classic, Chrono Trigger. It was extremely well-received at its time of release but has since developed a reputation as “not Chrono Trigger” (source: my old college friends). When Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition eventually hit the scene, I found the game to be decent, but not one of Square’s best PS1 titles.\n[embed]https://twitter.com/chronogame/status/1627595394946416640?s=20[/embed]\nThat’s fine. It’s still a worthwhile game, especially if you love Square’s PS1-era RPGs. This recent port, however, I found to be kind of stinky, although that’s not what I actually said. My sentiment was more along the lines that it was a barebones port that was serviceable but had framerate issues that made it feel like it failed to reach my bare minimum expectations. Hopefully, this patch will bring the port up to more acceptable standards.\nChrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition is available now on Switch, PS4, Xbox One, and PC. No date was given for the patch.\nThe post Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition to receive a soothing patch appeared first on Destructoid.",

There's not too much to glean from the video, but it does feature the main theme from Pokémon Red and Blue. Since the reveal earlier this month that Game Boy and Game Boy Advance games are playable on Switch via Nintendo Switch Online, fans have speculated that older Pokémon games like Red, Blue, Yellow, Gold, Silver, Crystal, and even Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald could appear on the service one day. Perhaps that's an announcement we'll be getting this Sunday. \nThe next #PokemonPresents is on the way, Trainers! 🤩\n#PokemonDay 2023! 🎉\nhttps://t.co/Xo6KYjvSdj pic.twitter.com/FFrmk8a5z8\nFebruary 21, 2023\nWith the presentation lasting 20 minutes, there's plenty of time for an announcement like that and more. And in recent years, the Pokémon Day direct-style presentation has been quite stellar. Last year during the Pokémon Day stream, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet were announced alongside a big Pokémon Legends: Arceus update, a Pokémon Brillaint Diamond and Shining Pearl mystery gift (Shaymin), the Alola update for Pokémon GO, and other announcements for games like Pokémon Unite, Pokémon Masters EX, and Pokémon Cafe Remix. The Pokémon Company event announced a new online anime, too. \nOnly time will tell if this year's Presents features as many exciting announcements. Fortunately, we don't have to wait long because Pokémon Day is Monday, February 27. The Pokémon Presents begins at 6 a.m. PT/9 a.m. ET and will run about 20 minutes. \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer's Pokémon Scarlet and Violet review and then read our review of Pokémon Legends: Arceus. \nWhat do you hope to see announced during this Pokémon Presents?

However, Microsoft has had a bit of a rough go at it. To counter, though, the company has been proactive in attempting to get the greenlight from the FTC, going as far as promising PlayStation that Call of Duty games will continue to come to Sony's consoles and agreeing to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo hardware. \nNow, Microsoft president and vice chair Brad Smith has announced on Twitter that Microsoft has formally signed a legally binding 10-year agreement with Nintendo to bring Call of Duty games to Nintendo players. Here's the statement Smith released on behalf of Microsoft, in full: \nWe’ve now signed a binding 10-year contract to bring Xbox games to Nintendo’s gamers. This is just part of our commitment to bring Xbox games and Activision titles like Call of Duty to more players on more platforms. pic.twitter.com/JmO0hzw1BO\nFebruary 21, 2023\nMany have already begun to speculate how Activision Blizzard will bring Call of Duty games to Nintendo consoles, which are traditionally much less powerful than current-gen Xbox and PlayStation consoles, with \"full feature and content parity.\" \nIf I had to guess, Call of Duty will likely go the route of cloud gaming seen on the Switch, unless Nintendo's next console is set to be a significantly more powerful piece of hardware.

A new story trailer introduces a seemingly villainous character, Simon, while highlighting some of the dangerous monstrosities waiting to dismantle players. \nLies of P unfolds in the fictional, Belle Époque-era French city of Krat as players control Pinocchio, a mechanoid puppet on a quest to become human. A certain Mr. Geppetto might be able to help with that, but Krat has been overtaken by sinister creatures Pinocchio must cut down using his multi-purpose mechanical arm. \n\n\nThe gameplay takes heavy cues from From Software’s work – Bloodborne in particular – as players take down enemies with deliberate sword attacks, while various mechanical arms grant abilities like firing lightning bolts or a grappling hook to reel in targets. Outside of battles, sidequests present the option of lying to characters, and the truthfulness of your answers alters the direction of these stories. \nLies of P will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass), and PC.

He most recently directed Marvel’s Midnight Suns. \nIn a statement posted to Twitter, Solomon doesn’t state a specific reason for his resignation but does tease his next project by stating, “My brain is on fire with a new dream. Time to go chase it.” Whether or not this dream keeps him in the game industry is a mystery for now. You can read his full statement below.\nSome of our favorite memories of Jake’s time at Firaxis include this funny video of him visiting a game store to convince shoppers to buy XCOM 1.

The trailer then showcases how Taron Egerton's character is deadset on bringing Tetris to everybody after playing it once. Unable to get falling tetrominos out of his head, Egerton's character heads to the Soviet Union to convince the game's creator that he can make him a millionaire. \nCheck it out for yourself in the Apple TV+ Tetris trailer below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Tetris looks great – funny, suspenseful, dramatic, and a seemingly great retelling of how the \"greatest game ever made\" made its way to our hands via the NES and Game Boy. \nTetris is directed by Jon S. Baird and written by Noah Pink. It begins streaming on Apple TV+ on March 31. \nAre you going to check Tetris out next month? Let us know in the comments below!",

          "description": "Riot Games released a promotional video this morning revealing its plans to release three League of Legends spin-off games this year. Two of these titles, Song of Nunu and Convergence, had been previously announced, while the third game, The Mageseeker, makes it debut. \n\n\nThe Mageseeker is set to arrive first sometime this spring. Developed by Digital Sun, the team behind Moonlighter, it’s described as a gritty 2D action RPG. It stars Sylas and takes place in Demacia. You can find The Mageseeker on PC and unspecified consoles. \nConvergence launches this summer and was first revealed at The Game Awards in 2019. Starring Ekko, it’s a 2D action-platforming adventure by Double Stallion that features parkour and time-manipulation mechanics. Convergence launches for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC via Steam and Epic. \nSong of Nunu closes out the year. Releasing this fall, it centers on the young Nunu and his yeti partner Willump on a search to find Nunu’s mother. The charming adventure game focuses on the pair working together to solve environmental puzzles. Song of Nunu comes from the folks at Tequila Works, the developer of titles such as Rime and Gylt, and it will be available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC via Steam and Epic. \nRiot released its first League of Legends spin-off Ruined King in 2021 to generally positive reviews, so we're curious to see how these other projects fair and if they'll attract new, non-MOBA fans coming off Netflix's well-received Arcane series. Which League of Legends title are you most interested in? Let us know in the comments.",

          "description": "Illumination has taken its promotion of The Super Mario Bros. Movie to the next level by launching a website and commercial promoting the brothers’ New York City plumbing business, and it's actually pretty cool. \nYou can visit the website here, which features a commercial promoting the Mario Bros. business. Older fans will likely recognize the catchy jingle as the theme song of the 1989 Super Mario Brothers Super Show, which is a nice homage. \n\n\nThe website also features humorous testimonials, job opportunities, and even a working phone number. Calling this number (929-55-MARIO) plays a recorded message by the Charlie Day-voiced Luigi, which provides a nice sample of his performance as the green-clad sidekick. Texting the number returns a message, which, depending on when you sent it, may return a digital poster for the movie. GI editor Kyle Hilliard got this Toad poster when he texted the number yesterday:\nIn my case, I only got a message thanking me for my interest in Super Mario Bros. Plumbing with a link to a form submission on the website. I'm not sure what you get for submitting this form, but feel free to find out yourselves. \nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie premieres in theaters on April 7. You can check out the official movie poster here. Watch the latest trailer featuring Donkey Kong and Cat Suit Mario here.",

Dambuster Studios has announced it’s bumping the game’s release from April 28 to April 21.\nThe news came in an announcement tweet declaring the game has gone gold, meaning it's essentially complete and ready to be printed on discs. Dead Island 2 had previously been scheduled to launch on February 3 before it was delayed to April 28. Speaking of April 28, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor was recently pushed to that same day. It wouldn't be surprising if Dambuster moved its launch forward to steer clear of Star Wars' blast radius. \nYou asked for it, you got it.

Best of all, you can watch every episode right now. \nThe series, called PsychOdyssey, consists of a whopping 32 episodes, all of which are available to watch for free on Double Fine’s YouTube channel. Double Fine Adventure! earned praise for its raw, intimate look at the good, bad, and ugly sides of game development as the crew spent years filming in Double Fine's studio as Broken Age came together. Psychonauts 2's tumultous road to release, from crowdfunding campaigns to Microsoft's acquistion of Double Fine, makes its creation a fascinating subject, and we're excited to see how 2 Player Productions captured it. \n\n\nFor more on Psychonauts 2, you can read our review of the game here.

I liked what I saw in the initial trailer, sure, but what I found especially intriguing was that most of the game happens through a first-person view of someone driving an old station wagon through a beautiful but distraught Pacific Northwest forest. Rarely do driving games force a first-person view, and even fewer deviate from being a racer. \nPacific Drive does both, and after viewing roughly 30 minutes of gameplay during a virtual preview, I’m even more intrigued.

During today's Nintendo Direct, we got a new look at gameplay, plus the announcement of the Collector's Edition and a new Amiibo figure starring Link. However, we also got some unfortunate news surrounding the upcoming launch of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.\nIn its press release for the Nintendo Direct, Nintendo announced that the upcoming Zelda entry will retail for $69.99. This makes Nintendo the latest major publish to test the waters of raising the price of its triple-A titles in recent years. This follows other major publishers like 2K Games and PlayStation, who started pricing their major releases at $70 with the start of the new console generation in 2020. Last year, both Xbox and Ubisoft announced that their triple-A games would cost $70 going forward.\nWe reached out to Nintendo for comment regarding the reasoning for the price increase and if this will be the trend for its triple-A releases going forward, but did not immediately receive a response. We will update this story if Nintendo provides a statement.\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom launches on Switch on May 12.",

          "description": "A few months have passed since we released ScummVM 2.6.1. It's time to prepare for a new release!\nOur lovely developers added support, yet again, for a bunch of new ancient games that require testing:\nSoldier Boyz\nGLK Scott Adams Interactive Fiction games (C64 and ZX Spectrum)\nGLK Scott Adams adventures 1-12 (TI99/4A format)\nObsidian\nPink Panther: Passport to Peril\nPink Panther: Hokus Pokus Pink\nDriller/Space Station Oblivion\nHalls of the Dead: Faery Tale Adventure II\nBesides these games, we’d appreciate it if you could check our release testing list. Maybe you’ll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long - otherwise, there are some demos of these games available on our website.\nAnd since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we’ve seen notable changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.\nAs usual, we are not just adding support for new games. We are constantly working on improving the engines we already support and, in particular, we’ve seen some incredible work being done on the SCUMM engine. Yes, there are the usual bug fixes, but this time we are also adding a feature that helps playing the SCUMM games in a truly original fashion: Support for the original loading and saving dialogs within the GUI!\nSpeaking of truly original: Remember those old CRT displays we had back in the day? With ScummVM 2.7.0 you’ll be able to replicate this experience on certain platforms thanks to our new shader-based scalers. Go ahead and give it a try!\nAll testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.\nA detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.\nThank you very much for your support! Let’s make ScummVM 2.7.0 a great release - together!\n>",

Depending on your perspective, we’re either two months early for our usual April 1st release, or a bit tardy for the Christmas 2022 release we intended. We think the wait has been worth it. This is one of the largest releases we’ve done in several years, with numerous features and improvements covering the user interface, gameplay features, and modding extensions for NewGRF and Game Script creators. Some of the highlights are: Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. This includes better automatic scaling when using HiDPI or mixed DPI setups. Direct access to NewGRF/AI/GS settings from the new game window. Various small tweaks and improvements to several windows. NewGRFs can now provide engine variants that are shown hierarchically in the purchase list. Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. Custom league tables for GameScripts. More natural rivers which get wider as they flow downstream. And much more, which can be seen in the changelog or the previous release announcements! In addition to these features and improvements, we’ve fixed lots of bugs. (If you played with the RC2 testing release, most were fixed before then. See the changelog for full details.)
