          "description": "Amazon Games’ fantasy MMORPG New World has received its latest update, ‘Arenas’, which means you can now smack other players upside the head in teams of three. The update brings PvP arena combat in best-of-five contests that Amazon say are for “glory and riches”, but then quickly qualifies that they're actually for unique stuff to decorate your in-game house with. The trailer makes the whole thing seem pretty wacky, see for yourself below.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I wouldn’t even be one of those rebels who wear the long funny bike helmets. There would be no “Liam: A Star Wars Story” premiering on Disney+. Instead, I'd be the guy who changes the bedding at a grungy BnB on Tatooine. I would spend my days just sort of vibing on the fringes of all the excitement, blissfully unaware of the very important adventures occurring in a galaxy very-very-close-actually.\r\n\n\r\nMaybe this is why Hardspace: Shipbreaker appeals to me so much. As a cutter, a nameless employee of the LYNX Corporation, you’re about as important to this particular vision of the future as the lad who polishes the floors on the Death Star. You are a nobody. But Shipbreaker relishes in how much that still makes you somebody. \r\n\n \nRead more",

In a community post, AMD asserted this particular Preview Driver could provide double-digit percentage gains in games running DirectX 11; claims that were backed up by early independent testing, like the creator of benchmarking tool CapFrameX getting an extra 24% out of Crysis Remastered.\r\n\n\r\nThis week, AMD Software Adrenaline Edition 22.5.2 released, making that new Radeon driver available to anyone who didn’t fancy switching to preview builds. Armed with an RX 6500 XT (a low-end card that desperately needs a performance kick), I gave the new software a whirl – and found that, for all those big numbers, Radeon owners should probably lower their expectations.\r\n\n \nRead more",

When you snap shut a piece of fiction you’ve been reading for days, or months even, it can be difficult severing those relationships you’ve built with its characters. Unless there’s a direct sequel, you must pull your pants up and shelve those emotions and move on.\nNot that I struggle with letting go of characters and stories particularly, but my brain makes an exception for the Yakuza games. More specifically, Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio's games. I’ve reached a point where I’m ordering Lost Judgment with no intention of playing it for months - maybe even a year? It’s all a ploy to hang onto RGG’s characters and worlds for as long as I can; a sort of buffer to keep the unease at bay. Having nowhere to turn to next isn’t an option.\nRead more",

According to the mission summary for Ungola: “No living creature save for her children has ever entered and lived to tell the tale.” That’s enough to put anyone off.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Ne'er touch the muffin pan since. No, of course it's our favourite video games that made big swings but didn't quite hit, a Nate Crowley-backed themed - and he kicks us off with a bid discussion about the infamous Jurassic Park tie-in game Trespasser. Try spelling \"jurassic\" properly first time; I've never been able too. \nDiversions this week are discussing classic UK subterranean tourist attractions Wookey Hole and Cheddar Gorge, and how Matthew's life could have been different if only he'd been Wookey Hole's witch mascot. Nate has bought a model kit for one of those massive excavation machines, which he says is \"about as big as an Alsatian\" and \"basically a bin-bag full of girders\". So he is turning it into an Orc sewage treatment plant. Standard week to be honest.\nRead more",

Heck, Scream 5 even opens with a joke about how kids today only like 'prestige' horror like The Babadook.\nI'm convinced that there's a middle ground, where you can have a slasher horror that loves the tropes and knows how to work them, but still feels smart and fresh in 2022. And, preferably, stars pro-wrestler and part-time actor David Arquette. This week I played some of The Quarry.\nRead more",

Some people - the cool kids of school - think they’ve got it all figured out, while others just mope about in their groups of indie kids, emos, and nerds, to name but a few very atypical retinues. It’s all a lie, though: in reality everyone’s an idiot as a kid, blissfully unaware of adult problems as they struggle through the most painfully awkward years of their lives. \r\n\n\nFloppy Knights revels in that dorkiness. A tactical card-based game that’s been in early access since last June, Rose City Games’ adventure stars Phoebe, an absolutely adorable and excruciatingly optimistic nerd who delights in tackling problems facing her community. To this end Phoebe’s only gone and constructed her own AI, Carlton, and the two help out townsfolk by destroying monsters with their own beasties. \r\n\n \nRead more",

Axe-wielding goat lad Valtan arrives this month to finally incorporate team-based Legion Raids into the Western version of Lost Ark too.\r\n\n \nRead more",

We gawked at the coolest booths on the show floor. I got nightmares after looking at a super cursed baby. My personal highlight, though, was talking to the Pinny Arcade collectors during the show's official trading event.\r\n\n\r\nI’ll admit, before I went to PAX I didn’t really appreciate how big Pinny Arcade was. I’d definitely seen photos of colourful metal pins depicting characters from various video games fly across my screen as I browsed Twitter, but I had never thought much about them beyond that. I was shocked, then, to arrive at PAX and realise just how integral this collectable is to the show. Merch booths sell starter packs, individual demo stations flog game specific rarities and avid fans adorn their lanyards with their favourite pieces. It turns out, Pinny Arcade is huge. \r\n\n \nRead more",

The aim is to clear out rows of matching cubes, while then finding fresh chains for the spare cubes that are left behind. your only enemies are the clock, and some often dizzying background imagery.\nThis gameplay is better demonstrated in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber Retro MGV.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iw3OukUwYJw\nWhen I first saw Flipull referenced as this week's Arcade Archives release, I had no idea what it was, but once I realized that it was renamed \"Plotting\" in the west, the memories came flooding back. I certainly remember Plotting, (and Taito's very similar tile-matcher, Puzznic), from my early gaming years. The cute puzzler is one of those gaming memories that remains locked away in the subconscious until a familiar flyer, magazine advert, or box art image magically opens up some long-discarded file in the brain. It's good to see it again after all of these decades.\nFlipull is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.\nThe post Taito’s Flipull joins the Arcade Archives and recalls a Plotting past appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "No more awkward post-fight goodbyes\nA new mod for Elden Ring aims to make co-op persist beyond the fog door, and it's going into beta this week. Modder LukeYui's seamless co-op mod for Elden Ring is going into public beta on May 27.\nYes, Elden Ring does already support co-op. But it is limited to certain areas and generally feels like it's meant for tackling bosses or tough areas, rather than exploring the Lands Between together. The seamless co-op mod for Elden Ring could change that.\nShown off in a video, LukeYui's mod allows for multiple players to ride their horses, get shared rewards from great enemies, and engage in PvP. Even when the host dies, they can spectate the other player.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHKuJO9nK-8\nThe mod will go live on NexusMods on May 27. No indication's been made towards how long it will stay up. But several alpha testers will also be streaming the co-op action. You can find their Twitch links in the mod's trailer description.\nThe Fellowship of the Elden Ring\nIt's a pretty cool thought that, if this mod pans out well, players could truly co-op great swathes of Elden Ring. While the drop-in co-op works right now, it's really only for spurts. Being able to run the entirety of an area, or just explore together, is something else entirely.\nOf course, Elden Ring has already been a hotbed for neat mods. Some let you summon bosses, or even infamous boss-killers. One project is trying to put FromSoftware's latest into the realm of virtual reality. And another went the hardware route, making a Fisher-Price controller work with Elden Ring.\nIt's safe to say Elden Ring is one of the year's biggest releases. As time rolls on though, I'm looking forward to more of what modders can do with the massive world FromSoft has made. And letting me and three of my friends engage in jolly co-op adventures is certainly a good pitch.\nThe post Elden Ring seamless co-op mod goes into beta this week appeared first on Destructoid.",

It was pretty much universally praised, won plenty of Game of the Year awards, and sold a butt load of units. Kratos has become one of the faces of the PlayStation brand, and rightfully so — even before the reboot, God of War was considered one of the best game series of all time.\nNow fans are thrilled to have that legacy continue, because the next entry in the franchise, God of War Ragnarok, is finally getting ready for its 2022 release, which fans were unsure it was going to be able to meet.

Starting now you can even trigger up a Diablo Immortal PC pre-load, and be ready for the June 2 launch while you peruse a new blog post that showcases a ton of details for what happens next week.\n\nThe post is fairly comprehensive, offering up full launch times, as well as all of the controllers that the game will support (the big ones are the Xbox One controllers and DualShock 3-4, as well as the DualSense — and the Switch Pro Controller in wired form or wirelessly via \"Mayflash Magic NS\").\nGlobally, the game will launch at 1PM ET on June 2, but the full global release calendar can be seen above (and again, Diablo Immortal PC pre-load is available now). The team reiterates that there are eight zones, as well as the following classes playable in the launch build: Barbarian, Crusader, Demon Hunter, Monk, Necromancer, or Wizard.\nIt'll feature cross-progression, so long as you log into your Battle.net account, which allows you to carry over progress from PC to mobile devices. Finally, here are the minimum and recommended PC requirements (with a note that \"ultra\" settings are only available on PC, or select iPad devices):\nMinimum Requirements For PC\nOperating System: Windows® 7 / Windows® 8 / Windows® 10 / Windows® 11 (64-bit)\nCPU: AMD FX-8100 or Intel Core i3\nGPU: NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 460, ATI Radeon™ HD 6850 or Intel® HD Graphics 530\nMemory: 4 GB RAM\nRecommended Specifications For PC\nOperating System: Windows® 10 / Windows® 11 (64-bit)\nCPU: Intel® Core i5 or AMD Ryzen™ 5\nGPU: NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 770 or AMD Radeon™ RX 470\nMemory: 8 GB RAM\n*Disk Space Requirement: 24GB\nThe post Diablo Immortal PC pre-load is available now, will support Switch Pro controller appeared first on Destructoid.",

Following on from an array of character trailers and a semi-successful beta test, the great-looking punchfest will finally launch on PlayStation and PC platforms June 28.\nTo help keep the fans' hype fires stoked, Nexon released a short new trailer taking a look at the title's single-player options. Those of you who don't feel like throwing down with friends or strangers in rollback-based online matches will instead be able to lock horns with the CPU in Free Battle (essentially Offline Vs.), Arcade Mode, in which your chosen character takes on a series of player-chosen opponents, and Survival, where you can test your mettle against an endless run of enemies, cashing out your score for a variety of health, damage, and meter buffs between fights.\nThese all seem like mighty fine ways to get acquainted with DNF Duel's exciting roster of characters.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JY1H30c_TdA&t\nIn addition to the above modes, it should be noted that DNF Duel also includes its own individual Story Mode, which uses comic book-style panels and a rotational cast of characters to tell a new chapter in the Dungeon Fighter Online universe. Once you've held your own in these offline battles, I would not be surprised if you do not have a potential main character or two and will perhaps be getting ready to step up to plate for one of DNF Duel's rollback netcode-powered showdowns.\nDNF Duel launches June 28 on PlayStation and PC platforms.

Most famously, Nintendo fixed the fog in Ocarina of Time, which was one of the most egregious emulation releases in some time, and one of myriad errors.\nOver on Twitter, Switch \"tinkerer\" and Dolphin contributor OatmealDome figured out a basic patch notes rundown for the update, titled \"version 2.3.0:\"\nKirby 64 added\nStar Fox 64 had gamma adjustment enabled — gamma value was set to 1.8.\nDr. Mario 64 had renderer settings adjusted (“ConstValue_0” added)\nMario Golf had renderer settings adjusted (“ConstValue_1” added).\nIn short, you can see the results of the render fixing in the N64 on Switch patch here, and the gamma adjustment for Star Fox 64 is more obviously apparent. OatmealDome also notes that Kirby 64 is actually the least-touched N64 game to date, stating, \"Kirby 64 appears to have the least amount of patches and hacks that I’ve seen so far for this emulator. There are the usual renderer settings adjustments present, but there are no CPU instruction patches or hooks.\"\nWith that in mind, Kirby 64 also has a soft lock bug that will need to be addressed in the future. It occurs in underwater stages in specific conditions, but it's something for Nintendo to note nonetheless.\n[Update: Nintendo has acknowledged the Kirby 64 issue in a recent tweet, calling it a \"bug that can prevent players progressing under a certain condition.\" The patch is scheduled to arrive \"early next week.\" For Nintendo, this is a pretty fast response!]\nhttps://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1530202669511593985\nThe post Nintendo continues to patch and fix N64 on Switch games (Update) appeared first on Destructoid.",

I remember renting it because of a gaming magazine feature, and I couldn't be happier. As one of many \"dinosaur/prehistoric\"-angled games of that era (and the preceding NES generation), it had a vibrant visual style that still sticks out; a wild plotline involving demon kidnappers; and a protagonist that evolves and devolves from a monkey to a boy as part of the gameplay (similar to Ghosts'N Goblins).\nAlongside of a good platforming foundation, the stark aesthetic style and goofy premise will still hold up today for a lot of people: give it a shot!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_-LqmGv7ig\nThe post Underrated SNES game Congo’s Caper comes to Switch Online appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Creatures of the Night will be staying there\nIn a month from now, classic fighting game fans will be eagerly awaiting the arrival of hard-brawling retro compendium Capcom Fighting Collection, which gathers together 10 rock-'em sock-'em titles from the iconic publisher's past. And while some fans might think that this release may ignite the revival of some forgotten favorites, one of Capcom's own producers thinks that perhaps we should, unfortunately, keep those hopes in check.\nSpeaking in a new interview with Game Informer, Street Fighter producer Shuhei Matsumoto was asked whether the Capcom Fighting Collection shined new hope of M.I.A. franchises such as Red Earth, Cyberbots, and — more notably — Darkstalkers making their long-awaited comeback. Unfortunately, in Matsumoto's opinion, the …",

It debuts at 10AM PT, and here's the quick rundown:\n\"A new dungeon has arrived and yes, it definitely puts a new spin on existential crisis. Normally, this is where we reveal all sorts of new information for the TWAB readers out there, but in the spirit of this Season, we want you to experience it for the first time with a feeling of discovery. Believe us when we say that we couldn’t be more jazzed up to hear your thoughts!\"\n\nThis is alongside new gear themed after the Season of the Haunted, as well as details surrounding the \"Solar 3.0\" rework, the Iron Banner changes, the return of the Leviathan (\"the Sever game  mode challenges a team of up to three Guardians to navigate the seedy Underbelly of the derelict Leviathan to battle it out against hordes of foes to find and sever Calus’s power\"), and Nightmare Containment (a free-to-play public event).\nBungie has also detailed how the scythe weapon works:\nLight Attack: \nA horizontal slice that launches out a wide Solar projectile.\n4-hit combo.\nHitting enemies with the light-attack projectile Scorches them (30+20 stacks) and deals damage.\nThe light attack also does melee damage to nearby targets when the player swings.\nAir Attack: \nLaunches out a single Solar projectile with a cool spinning slice. Same projectile as the light attack, just with more aerial flare.\nHeavy Attack: \nSlam the Scythe into the ground and send out a fan-shaped group of AOE flame damage.\nHitting enemies with the heavy attack Scorches them (50+40 stacks) and deals damage.\nScythe Perk: \nWhen you defeat enemies with the Scythe, you spawn orbs of healing Solar light that float back to you and grant Restoration +2.\nOverall it seems like an action-packed season, and I should probably get on it soon.\nThe post A new mystery Destiny 2 dungeon is out later today appeared first on Destructoid.",

Respectively, they have worked on many franchises at Sega in the past, including Puyo Puyo/Phantasy Star Online 2/Sonic/NiGHTs, and Jet Set Radio/3DS Sega Classics/Panzer Dragoon. Now I wouldn't expect any of those franchises to make a glorious comeback on a random June 3 stream, but those are their credentials nonetheless.\nWe also have a small potential hint with the Twitter teaser image, which involves a Sega Mega Drive/Genesis controller in the shape of a dessert, with frosting as the d-pad and buttons. When the Sega surprise stream debuts, you can watch it below.\nIs it the \"Super Game\" project? I hope not!

Today, Striking Distance Studios founder and CEO Glen Schofield confirms The Callisto Protocol is no longer in the PUBG universe.\nPreviously, Striking Distance's debut project was set in the same universe as PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, or PUBG. That's not the case anymore, it seems.\n\"FYI @CallistoTheGame is its own story and world,\" Schofield tweeted today. \"It no longer takes place in the PUBG Universe. It was originally part of the PUBG timeline, but grew into its own world. PUBG is awesome, [and] we will still have little surprises for fans, but TCP is its own world, story, and universe.\"\nhttps://twitter.com/GlenSchofield/status/1529930056725712897\nThe upcoming game channels some strong Dead Space vibes, which makes sense given Schofield and other Dead Space veterans are on the project and open about its influence. In all honesty, it's probably a good thing that the team is free to do whatever it wants. Even if now, I'll never get the crazy Evangelion x Callisto Protocol crossover that would make my mind melt.\nIn space, no one can hear the Battlegrounds\nThe new game from Striking Distance, as mentioned, is being made by some Dead Space veterans. And from the sounds of it, it's definitely going for a similar mix of sci-fi and survival horror elements. The Callisto Protocol is currently Game Informer's cover story, and the digital magazine has some neat details about it.\nThis includes an every-man type protagonist thrust into an absolute hell-in-space. Creepy space-alien designs are on deck, too.\nWith the team at EA Motive also working on a Dead Space remake, this seems like a good time to be a fan of surviving untold horrors in space. The Callisto Protocol is due out on PC and consoles sometime this year.\nThe post The Callisto Protocol is no longer set in the PUBG universe appeared first on Destructoid.",

We're joined by a special guest every episode to help break down our thoughts on the topic that week and have a few laughs along the way. \nLast season, we broke from the mold established from our Metroid, Halo, Uncharted, and Bioshock seasons by covering the Gameography of a single development studio, Supergiant Games.

This role-playing game was originally released on Xbox in 2004 and later found its way to PC. You'll now have the chance to play it again on your TV or take it on the go on Switch for just $15.\nThe Sith Lords is set during a dark period for the Republic. As a Jedi in exile, you could bring stability to the Jedi Order and help the Republic, or embrace the dark side of the Force and help a new order take command. This sequel embraces player choice in meaningful and fun ways, allowing you to form tight bonds with your teammates and pick how you wield the Force.\nWe recently ranked The Sith Lords as the fifth best Star Wars game in our Top 30 Star Wars Games list, saying \"Although development switched studios from BioWare to Obsidian Entertainment, the choice-driven bliss of the original Knights of the Old Republic RPG is alive and well in Sith Lords. Picking up five years after the fall of Lord Malak, the Sith Lords is another finely penned tale that offers deeper dialogue options, another great cast of characters, and plenty of alignment-specific variables.\"",

Montreal has altered Batgirl’s biography in Gotham Knights following backlash about the game’s explanation for her paralysis recovery.\nBatgirl AKA Barbara Gordon is one of Gotham Knights’ four playable characters alongside Nightwing, Robin, and Red Hood in a story that sees the Bat family defending Gotham after Bruce Wayne’s death. In the 1988 comic story The Killing Joke, Barbara is famously shot through the spine by the Joker, paralyzing and confining her to a wheelchair for many years in which she lent tech and information support to Batman as Oracle. In DC's 2011 New 52 comic reboot, Barbara regains her mobility due to an experimental surgery followed by physical therapy/training. \nPer Eurogamer, Gotham Knights’ original website biography for Batgirl vaguely references the…",

          "description": "SPOILERS AHEAD!\nObi-Wan Kenobi on Disney Plus, you should avoid going any further. The latest Star Wars collectible announced introduces a new character, and it's unlike anything we've seen in the Star Wars universe. This odd companion appears to be this year's Grogu, and will be turned into a variety of collectibles that will be released this holiday season.\nThese announcements were made today by toy manufacturer Hasbro, and happened during Star Wars Celebration, a four-day event held in Anaheim, Calif.\nThe trailers for Obi-Wan Kenobi implied Old Ben would be keeping an eye on Luke Skywalker, but the show is more about his sister at this point. When we first meet Leia, we see she has a companion droid named LOLA (L0-LA59). This tiny, hovering droid is transforming into three different collectibles, one offering functionality that mimics the movements and sounds from the show.\nHasbro's animatronic edition features a touch sensor on LOLA's head that can activate over 45 different light, sound, and movement options. This version retails for $89.99 and will be released in the fall.\nHasbro's second LOLA offering is an interactive electronic figure that also offers lights and sounds, but lacks the movements. This figure is highly poseable, however, allowing for the panels on LOLA's back to be positioned in different ways. This figure releases this summer for $39.99.\nHasbro's final announcement ties in with the Grogu Bounty Collection. You can add two small LOLA toys to your shelves, each showing off the droid's personality in different ways. This series of figures will be joined by other figures based on R2-D2, BD-1, and Grogu. Hasbro is targeting a fall release for them.",

EA and Respawn Entertainment have officially revealed the sequel to Jedi: Fallen Order. This new title will continue the story of force-wielder Cal Kestis in Star Wars Jedi: Survivor.\nA brief teaser trailer was shown with the unveiling, which you can watch above. In it, the odds seem stacked against Cal and what may or may not remain of his crew from Fallen Order. Of the known characters, only Kestis and his trusty droid BD-1 make an appearance in the footage, though their cohort Greez's ship, the Stinger Mantis, is seen from the cockpit, empty and in a bad way in a desert.

          "description": "Team Fortress 2 remains an extremely popular game with a large active player base, but the last couple of years has seen it overrun by aimbots. A passionate group of fans has long pleaded with developer Valve to address the issue, and the company has finally responded. \nYesterday, the official Team Fortress 2 Twitter account posted a message in response to #SaveTF2, a peaceful campaign of fans working to raise awareness about the game’s rampant bot problem. Basically, bot programs have made the game nearly unplayable for some since they’ll instantly kill players upon loading up into match-ups, giving the bots users an unfair advantage. TF2 players have become increasingly vocal about the problem, but Valve has remained largely silent on the issue (even going quiet on the game’s forums) until posting the following message: \nTF2 community, we hear you! We love this game and know you do, too. We see how large this issue has become and are working to improve things.\nMay 26, 2022\nValve doesn’t elaborate on how it plans to tackle the problem or when to expect a solution but getting the notoriously quiet company to respond is an accomplishment and measure of relief for Team Fortress 2 fans. Hopefully, it results in a substantial response that comes sooner rather than later.",

          "description": "A not-so-long time ago in the same galaxy we all reside in, Respawn Entertainment deviated from its first-person shooter roots to create Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66. After he’s outed by the Sith, he embarks on a quest to recover an artifact capable of locating force-sensitive children while also avoiding capture by the Inquisitors, who are elite Jedi hunters. \nThe game features a blend of lightsaber combat and a suite of Force abilities. Borrowing inspiration from FromSoftware’s Soul series, encounters are challenging, requiring a strategic blend of blocks and parries to outduel opponents. Meanwhile, the various planets take on a Metroid-inspired progression with players unlocking abilities to backtrack to previously inaccessible areas. \nWatch on Twitch!\nFallen Order was released on November 15, 2019, and was a critical and financial success. It also served as a saving grace for single-player fans, providing proof to an increasingly multiplayer-focused EA that linear story-driven experiences can still make the big bucks. With a sequel reportedly in the works, we’re revisiting this gem of the Star Wars video game pantheon. \nJoin Marcus Stewart, Andrew Reiner, and John Carson on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central as we journey through the entirety of Cal Kestis’ adventure. Expect plenty of laughs, deaths, and general nerding out over all things Star Wars. We encourage you to hang out with us in chat.

Odds are most humans will be turned into tasty dinosaur snacks, but we probably won’t go down without a fight. Jurassic World Evolution 2 players can download a new expansion that adds some of the movie’s new dinosaurs to their parks on the same day. The Dominion Biosyn expansion adds the Gigantosaurus, Dreadnoughtus, Pyroraptor, Quetzalcoatlus, Therizinosaurus, and the long-overdue Dimetrodon.\nThe Gigantosaurs’ behavior in Dominion is apparently modeled after The Dark Knight’s Joker. This odd inspiration point was revealed by the movie’s director Colin Trevorrow in an interview with Empire Magazine. “I wanted something that felt like the Joker,” he said. “It just wants to watch the world burn.” We’ll have to wait to see just how much of that destructive quality comes out in the game’s version of the beast.\nThe arrival of dinosaurs is just a tiny part of this expansion, which offers a new ‘what if’ campaign inspired by the forthcoming motion picture. This campaign allows players to add new buildings to their parks, as well as a variety of new species, some of which are feathered. Existing dinosaurs will also get new skins. The new story unfolds through a variety of characters, including Claire Dearing (voiced by Bryce Dallas Howard), Dr. Alan Grant (voiced by Sam Neill), Dr. Ellie Sattler (voiced by Laura Dern), and Lewis Dodgson (voiced by Campbell Scott).\nOther new features for the park include an underground Hyper Loop transportation network, invisible fences, and new vehicles and decorations. All of it can be used in the Sandbox.\nFrontier Developments calls this expansion its biggest yet, and it’s slated to release on June 14.",

Just yesterday it was confirmed the headset will launch with over 20 games. The only announced title is Horizon: Call of the Wild, though that project may not appear if the event is highlighting third parties. At that point, it’s anyone’s guess as to what PS VR2 software we’ll see.\nThe last State of Play took place in March, which brought the reveals of games like Valkyrie Elysium, Exoprimal, and Gundam Evolution. Given that this could be Sony’s only real presence during June’s onslaught of game showcases, it hopefully has some heavy-hitters, even if they won’t be coming from its first-party studios. \nWe recently shared our own predictions on PlayStation reveals this summer during this week’s Game Informer Show podcast.

One of the project’s more intriguing aspects was that it canonically took place in the same universe as popular battle royale PUBG: Battlegrounds, albeit in the distant future and on another planet. As of today, that’s no longer the case.\nGlen Schofield, The Callisto Protocol’s creative director, took to Twitter to announce that the game now unfolds within its own story and fiction and not PUBG’s. \nFYI @CallistoTheGame is its own story and world. It no longer takes place in the PUBG Universe. It was originally part of the PUBG timeline, but grew into its own world. PUBG is awesome, &we will still have little surprises for fans, but TCP is its own world, story and universe.\nMay…",

Instead, he arrived to promote another Lucasfilm franchise he stars in by the name of Indiana Jones and dropped the big news of a 2023 release date for the next film installment.\nFord's segment started with a musical introduction by longtime Star Wars and Indy composer John Williams (who celebrated his 90th birthday in February) playing him onto the stage. Ford spoke about working on the new Indian Jones film and how it was nearing completion. \"I had a wonderful experience working with James Mangold,\" said Ford, according to a Tweet from Decider. \"I am really proud of the movie that we made. So I'll be seeing you around campus.\"\nFord says they've almost finished the next Indy film. \"I had a wonderful experience working with James Mangold,\" who is also here. \"I am really proud of the movie that we made. So I'll be seeing you around campus.\"\nMay 26, 2022\nBefore leaving the stage, Harrison Ford dropped potentially the biggest bit of information from today's panel: Indiana Jones 5 will be released in theaters on June 30, 2023. How about that for a final segment surprise?\nRight now the plot and title of Indy 5 are under wraps, but the IMDB page for the film is full of exciting faces joining Harrison Ford on the next great adventure. The page lists Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Mads Mikkelsen, Toby Jones, Shaunette Renée Wilson, and more joining the cast.\nIn 2023, Harrison Ford returns as the legendary #IndianaJones. Check out this first look of the new James Mangold-directed film. pic.twitter.com/ALs82tsmXw\nMay 26, 2022\nFollowing the announcement, the folks behind the Indiana Jones Twitter account posted the first image of the film of Jones crossing what looks to be an old, rickety bridge in a dark cave.

          "description": "Star Wars Celebration began today with a panel showing with a showcase of the projects Lucasfilm is working on, and the new Star Wars series Andor had the spotlight after the cast of Obi-Wan Kenobi left the stage. Not only was there a brief interview with the show's cast and crew, but a teaser trailer debuted along with the release date on Disney+ of August 31.\nThe teaser trailer shown is musically paced with anvil-like percussion and throat-singing casting the theme of the footage. Focusing on the growing tension between the rebellious citizens and the overbearing Empire, Andor will depict the five years of Cassian Andor's life prior to the events of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. The trailer shows those citizens preparing for conflict with imperial forces while Diego Luna's Andor voices his displeasure with the Empire over the footage. We, of course, see Cassian Andor sneaking around, but also a new look at Genevieve O'Reilly returning as Mon Mothma, who last played this role in Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith. Peppered throughout are shots of a lush forest, a stark white base set in a body of water, and a large futuristic city that is most likely Coruscant.\n“We’re going to rewind 5 years back from #RogueOne. We’ve already shot 12 episodes!“ - Tony Gilroy #StarWarsCelebration #Andor\nMay 26, 2022\nThe opening panel for this year's Celebration wasn't streamed, but plenty of news has come from the panel via the Star Wars official Twitter account. Executive Producer Tony Gilroy said that 12 episodes of Andor have already been shot for the premiere this fall, and twelve more episodes will encompass a second season that will lead directly into the events of Rogue One.\nAndor will be streaming exclusively on Disney+, and its premiere on August 31 will include the first two episodes of the series.\n[Source: Decider]",

While you’ll be able to brave the cinematic horrors with friends in person on launch day, the game’s online play has been delayed.\nThe studio tweeted a message stating that it’s delaying The Quarry’s online multiplayer to no later than July 8. That’s roughly a month after the game’s June 10 launch. Supermassive explains the move was made to ensure the rest of the game, such as its single-player and local co-op, is as polished as possible by the release date.\nAn update on The Quarry's online multiplayer: pic.twitter.com/Bipo0yxp2g\nMay 26, 2022\nThe full statement reads as follows:\nWhile a bummer, one would assume Supermassive’s other option was to delay The Quarry entirely, and it chose what it deemed the lesser of two evils. The game stars a group of teenage summer camp counselors who find themselves hunted by dangerous locals and another mysterious threat. Like Until Dawn and the Dark Pictures Anthology, players are presented with a myriad of choices that cause the story to branch in several ways – so much so that The Quarry apparently has 186 unique endings. The Quarry stars an ensemble cast that features David Arquette, Lin Shaye, Ted Raimi, Ariel Winter, Brenda Song, Justice Smith, and others. \nThe Quarry will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Supermassive recently released footage of the game’s first 30 minutes that you can watch here.

Among his most memorable roles is Henry Hill in Goodfellas and Shoeless Joe Jackson in Field of Dreams. In recent years, Liotta has had a resurgence in Hollywood with roles in Marriage Story, the Amazon Prime series Hanna, and multiple other projects in the works, including a film called Cocaine Bear and a series called Blackbird, that will, unfortunately, see the light of day without him around. \nAlthough his impact on the film industry is great, Ray Liotta also made a profound statement in video games, starring as Tommy Vercetti in Rockstar Games' Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. At the time, having veteran Hollywood talent in video games was a novel concept, expanded upon in the years following due in part to Liotta's portrayal of Vercetti. Vice City was an instant hit when it was released in 2002, receiving many awards, including Game Informer's 2002 Game of the Year. It's sold over 17 million copies according to a Take Two earnings report from 2008.\nLiotta leaves behind his daughter, Karsen, and his fiancée, Jacy Nitollo.

You play the role of a seasoned dinosaur handler who wants to protect the dinosaurs. These efforts will pit you against poachers, mercenaries, and scientists looking to create deadly hybrids. This free-to-play action/adventure experience will release for iOS and Android devices soon.\nThe top-down gameplay pushes you to rescue and collect dinosaurs, and also use them for battle against other prehistoric beasts and hostile human forces. The dinosaurs can also be used to aid you in battle.  Pteranodons drop supply crates, and the Triceratops can ram through objects.\n“Jurassic World Primal Ops lets players immerse themselves in the Jurassic World franchise, allowing them to deepen their connection with dinosaurs in thrilling, new ways,” said Jim Molinets, SVP of Production at Universal Games and Digital Platforms. “The game is reflective of the brand’s signature storytelling, intense action, compelling environments, and diverse characters, and promises to be engaging for new and long-time fans alike.”\nThe game will feature in-app purchases and features many of the dinosaurs that will debut in Jurassic World Dominion, a movie slated to open in theaters on June 10. Check out the trailer above and the images below to see what awaits you in Primal Ops. If you are in the market for a dinosaurs experience right now, Jurassic World Evolution 2 is quite good and with over 70 dinosaurs to place and interact with within your own theme park.",

In Fall 2021, Sony CFO Hiroki Totoki outlined plans to invest more heavily in console semiconductor shortages linked to the pandemic. But according to Eurogamer, component scarcity isn't the only thing catalyzing the new-gen deficit. The Russia-Ukraine war has also affected part inventory. In a financial presentation conducted yesterday, Sony CEO Jim Ryan stated that PS4 sales continue to be higher than those of the PS5. However, the shortages are expected to stabilize and overtake PS4 sales by 2024. \nIn the image above, you can see the PS5 projections. In year one, the PS5 outsold the PS4, in year two, it undersold the PS4 due to supply constraints, in year three, the gap is expected to close, and by year four onwards, the PS5 is expected to overtake its predecessor again. This, of course, won't be easy. Sony has two plans to help expedite the gradual sale increase: source several suppliers for greater stability and facilitate logistical negotiations to maintain optimal delivery routes. \nMatt Miller awarded the PlayStation 5 an A- in his review of the console and stated:\n\"The PlayStation 5 is an incredibly powerful and sophisticated piece of gaming hardware, sometimes virtually eliminating the tedium of loading screens that have plagued console gaming for decades. Games look amazing thanks to new lighting techniques, especially on 4K displays, and a proprietary sound engine ensures an equally arresting aural experience. While its outward aesthetic is attractive, it's also overpowering, and the design won't please everyone. A slick dashboard is easy to use and smartly designed and values what's important to you, most especially your leisure time.\"\nHopefully, we'll all get our hands on the new-gen Sony console we deserve as we grow closer to a future where stronger hardware takes precedence.\n[Source: Eurogamer]",

And we should really start celebrating Star Wars right now, as today is the anniversary of A New Hope's theatrical release.\nIf past Star Wars Celebrations are any example to follow, we'll see plenty of collectibles announcements over the weekend. Some toy manufacturers are getting out in front of the potential bombardment of news. Funko just announced the first wave of Pops based on the Obi-Wan Kenobi show, and I'm guessing we'll see more in the days to come.\nThis line offers a new version of Obi-Wan, looking slightly older than he did in Revenge of the Sith. We're also getting a menacing sculpt of Darth Vader, who looks exactly like you would expect. The only new character is Reva, the Third Sister, looking ready to ignite her lightsaber. A deluxe version of Obi-Wan riding an Eopie is also on the way. All of these figures are expected to hit retailers in October. You can see them below:",

          "description": "Ni no Kuni: Cross Worlds is the sixth entry in Level-5’s beloved JRPG series. The MMORPG was released in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan last year but is finally available in North America on mobile devices and PC starting today. You can watch the animation trailer below. \n\n\nLike the main installments before it – namely, Wrath of the White Witch and Revenant Kingdom – Cross Worlds is composed by the legendary Joe Hisaishi and features Studio Ghibli-animated cutscenes. According to the Ni no Kuni website, the story is as follows: \n“You are about to enter a brand new world in the virtual reality game Soul Divers. But as you explore and become stronger, you’ll realize this world is not a virtual one. A mysterious girl named Rania entrusts you with a mission: Rebuild your kingdom ransacked by powerful foes  and save the two connected worlds from certain destruction!” \nFor all you anime fans out there, Cross World’s central narrative seems directly inspired by the isekai genre. The animation trailer above reveals that the new Ni no Kuni still brims with the whimsy and eccentricity that the franchise is known for. Moreover, the high-fantasy overtones and vivid art style make a welcome return. \nKim Wallace had lukewarm feelings on Wrath of the White Witch, but Joe Juba awarded Revenant Kingdom an 8 out of 10 and stated:\n“Ni no Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom may not nail everything it attempts, but it gets the important things right. Building your kingdom is satisfying and engaging, even with the weak narrative hooks. The cycle of rewards became an obsession, and had me staying up late to recruit just one more ally, or complete just one more upgrade. Combat could be tighter, and other supporting elements could use some polish – but like any kingdom, this experience isn’t about individual contributions. It’s about how those contributions come together, and the fun of this experience as a whole outweighs its flaws.”\n\n\nHopefully, Cross World will garner positive reception too.",

          "description": "After finding success on PC, 2D fighter Them’s Fightin’ Herds is making its way to consoles this fall.\nIf the game reminds you of My Little Pony, it should. Them’s Fightin’ Herds is a spiritual successor to Fighting is Magic, an unlicensed fighting game based on the popular My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic series created by fans of the show (who appropriately call themselves Mane6). A big “cease and desist” from Hasbro forced halted Fighting is Magic's launch, forcing Mane6 to rework the idea into an original title. However, Lauren Faust, the mastermind of Friendship Is Magic, admired the project and lent her artistic talents to design Them’s Fightin’ Herds’ colorful cast of four-legged combatants. \n\n\nThem’s Fightin’ Herds sports a streamlined 4-button fighting system complete with combos (and juggle decay), a magic system, and super attacks. Players can duke it out in local and online versus modes, and an episodic story mode modeled as a classic top-down RPG features side quests and boss fights. The experience also boasts cross-platform matchmaking, rollback netcode, a replay system to rewatch matches, and a dynamic soundtrack that changes based on the characters. The game has been positively received since launching on Steam in 2020 and has amassed a dedicated following, with organized tournaments taking place at events such as EVO. \nThe console reveal news also comes alongside the announcement of a Season 1 Pass that introduces four new fighters, additional stages, and cosmetics. This pass can be purchased separately and is included in a $39.99 Deluxe Edition of the game. Otherwise, the base game runs for $19.99. \nThem’s Fightin’ Herds will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Switch at an undisclosed date. Physical versions of the Deluxe Edition are in the works by Maximum Games Store, set to launch within the same timeframe. You can pre-order a copy here.",

Now, End Global 7 has revealed that it’s been canceled. \nThis news comes by way of Eurogamer, which first reported on End Global 7’s statement released today. In that statement, the company says it is re-evaluating things such as risk profiles, investments, and portfolio strategies and that development of Daybreak Games Marvel MMO has ceased as a result. \n“EG7 today announced it will be discontinuing the development of the Marvel project at Daybreak Games,” the statement reads. “Based on the re-evaluation of the development risk profile, size of investment, and the long-term product portfolio strategy for the group, the board has decided to change the development priorities and reallocate resources within the group to focus on alternative long-term projects.”\nEG7 had planned to invest more than SEK 500 million ($50.5 million) in the Marvel project over the next three years. The company will now instead “diversify” this investment across multiple smaller projects within the studio group. This includes previously announced upgrades to The Lord of the Rings Online and DC Universe Online, as well as “new game opportunities with our first party, original IPs.” \nIt sounds like EG7 has washed its hands of Marvel, or vice versa, to some extent as it does not seem a Marvel game is in the publisher’s future.

However, beyond that, Leviathan also introduces a roguelike experience to play through. \n\n\n“[Leviathan] is very different to anything we’ve done before,” a press release reads. “It is more roguellike, with players caught in a time-loop. Players start together on an expedition, and each time they die, they lose their progress, but help the community try to break free from this loop together.\n“Difficulty has been turned up in a vairety of ways, but every death means a reset of the loop and a new proc-gen loadout. To make it easier to complete the eventual goal of breaking out of the loop with just one life, the community can work together on a persistent, global goal that permanently improves the quality and frequency of upgrade rewards found during each loop.”\n\nThe story of Leviathan reveals itself as players work alongside Specialist Polo and the actual Leviathan, “a large and imposing space creature shrouded in myth and mystery.” Those who undertake this expedition can earn rewards like The Whalestalker cloak, a mini Organic Frigate for your base, a Temporal Starship Trail, and more. Hello Games says the ultimate reward, however, is the first ever living frigate – an imposing tentacled beast – which will be your very own Space Whale to add to your freighter fleet. \nYou can view the full patch notes for Leviathan here.\nAre you going to be checking out Leviathan today?

However, in just a few months, it will finally launch into 1.0 on consoles and PC. \nMore specifically, Temtem 1.0 will go live on Sep. 6 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. Temtem has already been available to play on PS5 and PC so today’s news in terms of platforms is that it’s coming to Xbox and Switch in September. To celebrate the news, developer Crema has released a new trailer showcasing what to expect in 1.0. \n\n\nThat includes a new endgame island and much more in-game. Pre-order links for Switch aren’t yet live, but on Xbox, there’s a standard edition you can pre-order and a deluxe edition. The latter includes “bonus cosmetic content (to be revealed at a later date) – available when Temtem launches.” If you prefer to buy your games physically, you can do that too because there will be both a standard physical edition of the game and a Temtem collector’s edition as well. \n“Crafted with care by Crema, Humble Games, and Final Boss Bundle, it contains a lovely diorama statue and a set of enamel pins of our oldest partners, the starters,” a press release reads. “Want to immerse yourself further into the world of Archipelago? It also includes a Temcard replica of fan-favorites Kinu, Gharunder, and Shuine, and a set of three irresistible embroidered patches that will make you feel like you’re part of the Narwhal Crew.”\nHowever, this bundle does not include the game. You can pre-order the collector’s edition, as well as additional Temtem merch, here.

          "description": "Hogwarts Legacy releases this holiday for multiple platforms, but PlayStation 5 players will experience additional technical magic thanks to the game’s suite of DualSense features.\nA PlayStation Blog post revealed the different ways Hogwarts Legacy takes advantage of the controller’s haptic feedback. For starters, spells sport individual physical button resistances and feedback to make them feel unique from one another. In a nice touch, these haptic effects are isolated to the right side of the controller to simulate wielding a wand in one hand more accurately. Hopefully, this feature can be flipped to the other side of the gamepad so that left-handed players can experience the same immersion. \n\n\nThe DualSense light bar displays various flash effects for each spell, but it also radiates the color of your chosen house. For the uninitiated, that’s red for Gryffindor, green for Slytherin, yellow for Hufflepuff, and blue for Ravenclaw. \nThe controller will also simulate sensations such as crushing botany ingredients in potions class, deflecting and disintegrating incoming magic using the shield spell Portico, and soaring the skies atop a broom or hippogriff. Hogwarts Legacy also leverages the PS5’s 3D audio to pick up smaller sound effects such as a crackling fireplace and other environmental sound cues.  \nTo learn more and watch additional video clips of these features in action, be sure to visit the PlayStation Blog post. Hogwarts Legacy doesn’t have a release date, but it’s slated to arrive sometime this holiday. You can play it on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. You can watch an extended gameplay demonstration in March’s State of Play video here.",

Ships...? The video in the tweet features a cargo ship? You’ll love the joke if you watch the clip. In the said video, there’s a reveal of many familiar faces from Task Force 141 showing up in Modern Warfare II. As the drone footage zips through the Port of Long Beach, the camera focuses on the sides of shipping containers displaying the portraits of Captain John Price, Simon “Ghost” Riley, John “Soap” MacTavish, Kyle ‘Gaz’ Garrick, and, according to the YouTube description for the video, the introduction of Mexican Special Forces Colonel Alejandro Vargas.\nFor a better look at the cast of Modern Warfare II, check out the gallery below.\n\nWhile we now know Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II “ships” on October 28, we don’t know much of anything about the setting, story, and multiplayer, and still don’t have any known platforms for its release. PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC are a shoo-in, but PlayStation 4 and Xbox One are likely, but questionable additions as we move forward in the console generation.",

The Switch version will arrive sometime later in the year.\n\n\nThe game was first announced in 2019 and was originally slated to arrive in 2021 before being delayed into this year. The story follows J.R.R. Tolkein’s books rather than Peter Jackson’s film trilogy, detailing Gollum’s happenings during the first chapters of The Fellowship of the Ring after he loses the One Ring to Bilbo Baggins. Gollum embarks on a journey across Middle-earth, visiting locations such as Mirkwood and Barad-dûr. \nGameplay-wise, Gollum is a stealth adventure game as players sneak around environments and can choose to avoid or engage enemies. The choice depends on if you indulge Gollum’s vicious nature or the more timid tendencies of his other personality, Smeagol. Climbing and platforming are also a big part of the experience as players can scale structures, adding verticality to exploration. \nWe last saw The Lord of the Rings: Gollum in action in 2021 during a hands-off preview demo. You can read our impressions of it from that time here.",

In the 16-bit sequel, Sonic had new moves and a two-tailed fox friend to aid him, but with those upgrades came more significant threats from the evil Dr. Robotnik. Sonic the Hedgehog 2 on Genesis was immediately regarded as a definite upgrade over the already strong first entry in the series.

This quirky game features the protagonist Chewy as he tries to outwit the evil Borks. Escaping from their high security zone, F5, will just be the start of his adventure.\nIf any of you have the game and are willing to test it out, we'll welcome any feedback. You will need a daily development build. As always, please submit the bug reports to our issue tracker. \nPlease note that the ScummVM version does have one major outstanding issue: the music used by the game is in a custom format we've been unable to properly support yet.

          "description": "A few days ago, Google announced the list of students accepted for this year's Google Summer of Code.\nWe are very proud to welcome 4 students this year who will be working on various parts of the project during the upcoming months.\nPragyansh Chaturvedi (aka Raikou) will work on improving our DIRECTOR engine. His effort will help us to allow support for many 90s-era adventure games made with the Macromedia Director authoring tools. By implementing more internal functions used by DIRECTOR, Pragyansh's main objective is to extend support for Meet Mediaband and The Journeyman Project (Win and Mac), making them fully playable without any glitches.\nMichael Hayman (aka Quote58) is about to implement support for The Immortal. The game (released in 1990) can be described as a mix of genres involving RPG elements with action and puzzles. Many changes across different game variants (written in pure assembly code!) will make this an interesting challenge. This project is a continuation of a GSoC task initially started by a former student back in 2018.\nEmanuele Grisenti (aka grisenti) will be working on a new engine, HPL1. The original sources for this engine got recently released by the original developer Frictional Games under GPLv3. The purpose of this project is to achieve a full port of this engine to ScummVM, with the goal of supporting the 2007 survival game Penumbra: Overture.\nAvijeet Maurya (aka StableSteady) will pick up several incomplete engines: MacVenture, Avalanche, Glk-Scott, Pink and WAGE. Some of these engines are very close to completion, but not quite there yet. The main objective of Avijeet's task is to identify all missing features and fix existing bugs. The goal for his project is to bring the above engines to a stable state.\nThe team is very excited about the upcoming weeks – and we hope you are as well.\nPlease give a warm welcome to our new students! Let's make GSoC 2022 a huge success – together!\n>",
