          "description": "If you played Hypnospace Outlaw, there’s a high chance you’ll remember Zane “Zane_Rocks_14” Lofton. He’s one of the more memorable characters you meet in Tendershoot’s alternate reality web simulator, an angsty teenage boy whose home page is slathered in camouflage textures and GIFS of exploding handguns. Since release, Zane has become one of Hypnospace’s de facto mascots, a beloved dweeb that is abrasive but also kind of painfully relatable? It’s hard to laugh at Zane’s baggy trousers and love for Linkin Park-esque rap-metal when you grew up in the mid-2000’s. I mean, we all bought a dog lead from Wilkinson’s and hooked it between the belt loops on our jeans at one point, right? …right?\n\n\nAhem. Anyway. Announced earlier this year alongside Dreamsettler (a proper sequel to Hypnospace), Slayers X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengance of the Slayer is an FPS spin-off that stars the fan-favourite teen. Slayers X is framed as being an in-universe project that Zane worked on as a teen, and has been uncovered by his now 37-year-old self, who is determined to finally see it released. There’s a short demo available as part of Steam’s most recent Next Fest, and I’m delighted to say it’s exactly what I hoped it would be.\r\n\n \nRead more",

And, sure enough, we actually got a pretty big eyeful of it.\nNow, keep in mind that this game is set in outer space, the vast expanse and wonders of which we cannot ken. You could do any cool, awe-inspiring thing you want with space. Crystal waterfalls that flow backwards into the sky. Aurora borealis-like lights but so low down they whip along at ground level. Deserts of hot-pink dust sprouting deep blue rock spires. Destiny 2 has some cool planets, for example. Imagine my confusion, then, when the footage of Bethesda's brand new IP made it look like they've accidentally done Fallout or Elder Scrolls again.\nRead more",

Balancing the political needs of your state against diplomacy, economy and, you know, war, will take a lot of wrangling of lists, menus and percentages, which you can see in the new gameplay trailer debuted at the PC Gaming Show.\nRead more",

Well, those brothers are now Team Clout and that game now exists, albeit called simply Ill. I've not got much to point you towards - there's no Steam Store page, no high-res press screens, no release window. Even calling the video from the Future Games Show a gameplay trailer is taking the biscuit, if not most of the factory floor at McVities. But the vibes, as they say, are immaculate: bare feet on a grubby floor, shambling horrors with many half-glimpsed appendages, and a gun that is surely too small to protect you from any of it. Resident Evil but injected with your most virulent 2022 strain.\nRead more",

One of the coolest announcements at the event was Hill Agency: PURITYdecay, described as an \"Indigenous cybernoir detective game\" and in the works at Achimostawinan Games. Although maybe \"in the works\" isn't quite an accurate description, because the game is in fact out very soon: on August 31st this year, to be exact.\nThe trailer is a pitch-perfect hearkening back to the golden age hardboiled detective stories of the 1940s — complete with a black-and-white palette with just the occasional hint of colour to highlight the high-tech parts. High-tech because, despite its 20th century influences, this game is set quite far in the future, in 2262. It's not exactly a nice vision of the world in 240 years' time, though, as the narrator is quick to point out that it's riddled with \"crime, conflict, and propaganda\". Truly holding up a mirror to our times, then.\nRead more",

I'll be honest that maths has never been my strongest suit, but figuring out how games work under-the-hood is one of my favourite things to do. So I've spent most of this week chasing answers, and I've come up with a ballpark estimate of what it would cost to max out your character. The answer is: £46,000, or $51,000, to fully equip your character with the best gear as quickly as possible using premium currencies.\nRead more",

Not a chance. I wouldn't like it.\" People were shocked at my refusal. \"But nothing will go wrong!\" they exclaimed. This misses the universal truth that even - and indeed, especially - when it is guaranteed nothing will go wrong, something will always go wrong in space.\nHonestly, who can say that they've played a video game set on a space station and not encountered at least one deserted corridor plunged into darkness, but with one spotlight tipped over onto its side to cast ominous shadows? Raise your hands. Terror in space has never gone out of fashion, really, but the source of the terror does seem to go in cycles. In the 2010s a lot of the danger came from an AI gone a bit sinister and funny. As we saw at last night's Summer Game Fest, though, the monsters are back, baby.\nRead more",

The Ukrainian studio has been public about the effect the Russian invasion has had on development. Today the team opened up about it, sharing an emotional update as it confirmed S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 is moving to 2023.\nWhile the studio shared a new video about S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 itself, which you can find here, GSC Game World also shared a dev diary about its current status. The three-minute video is powerful and a heavy watch, just so you know.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxcfxdG22pg\nThe video shows the toll that the invasion has taken on its developers and where they live. While some have been able to get out, others have not been able to, or opted to volunteer or even serve in the armed forces. The video shows developers living in small hallways, rushing for bomb shelters, and walking around in destroyed city blocks. One describes how he's unsure whether some of his loved ones are safe or not. It is a heavy reminder of the real toll the Russian invasion has taken on average people in Ukraine.\nDuring the update, GSC Game World confirms that it has pushed the release of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl into 2023.\nDevelopment during wartime\nThe Russian invasion began on Feb. 24, 2022 and has continued for 111 days. It's taken its toll on many Ukrainian citizens including those at GSC Game World and more, as detailed in a report from IGN in May. Many other developers and publishers have called for aid and action in response to the invasion, including withholding their games and services from Russia and Belarus.\nOur hearts go out to the GSC Game World team. The studio has shared a link at which you can help provide aid.\nThe post S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 moves to 2023 as dev team shares emotional update on its current state appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Press X to doubt\nSo all eyes are on Diablo 4, which is due out \"in the next 12 months\" according to a statement made during the Microsoft Xbox Conference this past weekend. Overwatch 2 hasn't fared so well in the public eye ever since it was revealed, and Diablo Immortal has been earning the ire of players all over the world. When coupled with Warcraft III: Reforged and all the other goings-on at Blizzard, the company has a clear image problem. Diablo 4 cosmetics likely won't fix that.\nIn any case, it hopes to solve those problems with Diablo 4, which is now seemingly the golden goose that will restore some of the company's reputation: at least in the eyes of some execs. But they're having a hard time selling it given, well, everything we just talked about above.\nFollowing criticism that f…",

          "description": "You're History\nThe world of River City Saga: Three Kingdoms is about to get a little more dangerous, as publisher Arc System Works and developer APlus Games have revealed that River City Girls' inimitable schoolgirl sluggers, Kyoko and Misako, will be making their presence felt in the upcoming historical brawler.\nAs we have previously reported, River City Saga: Three Kingdoms is a BARF-tastic take on the ancient Chinese fable of “Sangokushi,” perhaps better known to westerners as the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. The classic tale has been adapted to fit within the rock-'em, sock-'em Kunio-kun universe, complete with retro-inspired visuals, belt-scrolling brawler action, and a cast of familiar heroes and villains telling the tale of the fall of the Han Dynasty, albeit with far more groin kicks.\n\nIn addition to the story mode, River City Saga: Three Kingdoms will feature a multiplayer-centric side adventure, \"Heroes of the Three Kingdoms: Battle of Red Cliffs\". This is where our girls get to enter the fray, joining a roster of 24 Kunio-kun legends to battle through 10 stages of madcap action for one-to-four players. Both Kyoko and Misako have received something of a visual redesign in order to fit in with the period setting — and they both look just darling in the retro-contemporary duds.\nOf course, this cameo appearance will get the pint-sized pugilists warmed up for their own incoming release, River City Girls 2, which is currently in development at WayForward with a tentative launch window of summer 2022. You can check out information on the sequel in our previous reports here and here.\nRiver City Saga: Three Kingdoms launches July 21 on PlayStation, PC, and Nintendo Switch.\nRiver City Saga: Three Kingdoms adds Misako and Kyoko from River City Girls [Gematsu]\nThe post River City Girls bringin’ the brawl to River City Saga: Three Kingdoms appeared first on Destructoid.",

American Arcadia is one of those games. From the very first trailer I saw, I knew it was going to be one of those titles that delivers on aesthetic and concept, which can either be spectacular, or flop on its face. After playing a preview of American Arcadia for the Tribeca Games Fest, I have a feeling it will be leaning toward the former.\nSometimes a game can bite off more than it can chew with a bunch of different elements — more complexity isn't always better.

Speaking of, development will continue on the PC version as \"external teams\" handle the Xbox console ports.\nhttps://youtu.be/vPEGKJlE9LE\nIn addition to the Xbox port (the first half of 2023 is going to be hella busy for gaming, isn't it?), the companies also announced that Valheim will join the PC Game Pass library in fall 2022. The best part: all three versions of Valheim — Steam, Microsoft Store, and Xbox — will have cross-play support for co-op survival. You don't have to make new friends.\n\"The porting is being done by external teams, so the core team at Iron Gate is still focusing on the Mistlands,\" the studio tweeted. The new biome update will be more exploration-focused.\n\"None of this would be possible without the incredible teams at Piktiv and Fishlabs who are continuing to work tirelessly on the Microsoft Store and Xbox ports, enabling us to focus on the Mistlands update and our exciting journey through Early Access.\"\nI wouldn't be surprised to see Valheim show up on PS4 and PS5 eventually — I'm expecting a sort of Deep Rock Galactic situation — but nothing to report yet. When it comes to still-in-development early access games, PlayStation fans can expect to wait.\nIt's been a while since we checked in, but Valheim has cleared 10 million sales on Steam.\nThe post Valheim is headed to Xbox One and Series X/S in spring 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Sign-ups and full details will be shared during the stream (which starts at 10:00 a.m. Pacific), but for now, we know that the Overwatch 2 beta will begin on June 28, and it'll include PC and console players this time around.\nhttps://twitter.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1536755605238697984\nIn terms of new content for this beta, an unnamed \"new map\" will join the rotation, and this will be players' first crack at Junker Queen, a long-time-coming Tank hero who appeared during Sunday's Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase. If you missed it, Blizzard also confirmed that Overwatch 2 will be free-to-play and launch on October 4, 2022.\nMy big takeaway recently as a Support player? Moira's deteriorating arm! Did you spot it?\nPC, PlayStation, and Xbox\nWhile Overwatch 2 is coming to all consoles (PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch), it would somewhat unsurprisingly seem that this beta will be limited to PlayStation, Xbox, and Battle.net based on those logos in the announcement image.\nSo far, PvP has been front and center, but plenty of lapsed Overwatch players are holding out for something special with PvE to bring them back into the fold — I hope the June 16 event gives us some much-needed clarity on that front. My time with the previous Overwatch 2 PC beta was short and not that sweet, and Chris wasn't really feeling it either in his initial check-in. After some updates (I'm still laughing about Zenyatta's high-impact kick) and admissions that there's much more to be done, I feel like there is a way to eventually ignite widespread excitement for the sequel, but it's been pretty dicey so far.\nAccording to the team, they've \"only just scratched the surface.\" So let's hear it!\nThe post Overwatch 2’s console and PC beta starts June 28 appeared first on Destructoid.",

The next one will be a Stardew Valley Switch Online trial, limited to Australia, Europe, and Japan currently (NA is expected to get it at some point).\nWith my European and Japanese Switch accounts (they're helpful for reporting!), I was able to see the notification in the \"news\" sections at the bottom of the Switch UI. The trial will run from June 13 (12:00 JST) through June 19 (17:59 JST). Australia even has an eShop page up for it.\nIf you somehow haven't played Stardew Valley yet, now is the time, provided you're able to take part in the trial. It's tough to really put into words how magical this game is that hasn't already been said, but suffice to say a few hours with it should give you a clue as to whether or not you're going to be spending another 100 hours with it.\nAlso note that you should be able to take advantage of the extra My Nintendo mission points once the trial is live. As a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward.\n[Update: As expected, this Stardew Valley Switch Online trial offer was added to the North American region this week. It'll run from June 14 at 10AM PT until June 20 at 11:59PM PT.

Earlier this year, Capcom announced that they'd be able to do just that, because they had free updates for Resident Evil 2, 3, and 7 in the works for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.\n\nDuring today's Capcom Showcase as part of the summer news blitz, they let us know that actually, these updated versions are available instantly. That was a nice surprise! The Xbox update will even be available with Xbox Smart Delivery, making it even easier for players to update to the best version for their console.\nAs reported a few months ago, the updated versions mostly just give us nicer graphics for each of the titles.

The Resident Evil Village Winter's Expansion packs in more Mercs content, a story for Rose, and a whole lot more on Oct. 28, 2022.\nThe big ticket item here is Shadows of Rose, a new story set in the Village universe following Rosemary Winters. It seems to get pretty mind-twisting and creepy, but for those who dig the expanded world of Resident Evil, that's a pretty interesting set-up.\nShadows of Rose is set 16 years after the events of Resident Evil Village, and the story sees Rose entering the consciousness of the Megamycete. Here, she has to deal with her pasts and nightmares. And apparently also a very evil, Persona palace version of the Duke.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJDIenuQepo\nIf story isn't what you're looking for, there's also the addition of a third-person mode, making it feel a bit more like a classic Resident Evil game. This new vantage point offers a new outlook, and possibly a little more distance between you and all the hand-based injuries Ethan suffers in Village.\nTowering mercenaries, oh my\nThe Mercenaries game mode is also adding three additional characters: Chris Redfield, Karl Heisenberg, and the towering Lady Dimitrescu. Yes, Lady D fans rejoice. She's finally playable. Plus, there are some new stages to add some new challenges.\nThe Resident Evil Village expansion comes either separate, for those who just need to pick up the additional content, or the Resident Evil Village Gold Edition, which packs it all together.\n\nThe Winter's Expansion and Resident Evil Village Gold Edition are out on Oct. 28, 2022.\nThe post Resident Evil Village expansion includes third-person mode, a Rose story, and more this October appeared first on Destructoid.",

The video will go live on Thursday, June 16, at 15:00 PT / 18:00 ET / 23:00 BST. The video will be available on Capcom's social media channels such as YouTube and Twitter.\nNow, it's understandable that this seemed like a potential tease, and that perhaps the upcoming Dragon's Dogma anniversary celebrations might be an opening to spotlight some new project related to the series — the hungry fanbase would surely love such an exciting development. But it might be better for your health to temper those expectations and just enjoy the video without too high a hope. You would think that if Capcom did have a remake, remaster, sequel, or some other new title to announce, then they might have done it during tonight's stream, or perhaps at last week's Summer Game Fest.\nSo, just, keep yo'self in check...

He also uttered the name “Fallout 5” and gave an idea of when fans can expect to see it. \nSpeaking to Ryan McCaffrey, Howard confirmed that Fallout 5 will be the next game after The Elder Scrolls 6, which itself has entered pre-production:\n\"Yes, Elder Scrolls 6 is in pre-production and, you know, we’re going to be doing Fallout 5 after that, so our slate’s pretty full going forward for a while. We have some other projects that we look at from time to time as well.\"\nFollowing up on Starfield’s big gameplay demonstration at the Xbox + Bethesda Showcase, Howard revealed additional facts about the new IP. Starfield's main story is 30-40 hours long, or 20% larger than any Bethesda game to date. New Atlantis, one of Starfield’s four main cities and capital of the United Colonies, is also the largest city Bethesda has ever made. For character creation, Howard states there are roughly 20 character backgrounds to choose from. \nThe game’s procedural galaxy features the most hand-made content ever made by the studio. Boasting over 1000 planets that players can visit, Howard also clarified you cannot fly to each one seamlessly a la No Man’s Sky, describing the on-the-ground action and space gameplay as two separate experiences. In terms of space combat, Howard discusses how dogfighting (which he describes as having a slower pace) takes cues from games like FTL and MechWarrior and confirms that players can steal the ships they board. \nStarfield launches in 2023 for Xbox Series X/S and PC. \n[Source: IGN]",

While many of us will likely never get our hands on some of these unless we actually go to the show or find a vendor online, they're always fun to look at. This year, Funko is releasing a series of SDCC-exclusive Pop! figures. Game Informer can exclusively reveal the Pop Games: Sonic – Super Sonic First Appearance vinyl figure.\nThis version of Super Sonic features the ability to glow in the dark, paying tribute to his signature golden aura from the games, TV shows, comics, and movies. This vinyl figure stands at approximately 5.3 inches and gives the appearance it's floating above its stand. While I haven't seen the figure in person, the floating illusion probably combines with the glow-in-the-dark feature to create a cool effect when the lights dim.\n\nThis San Diego Comic-Con exclusive Funko Pop! figure comes in a box with either a \"2022 Summer Convention Exclusive\" sticker or the \"2022 San Diego Comic-Con\" sticker on the box. Despite the image in the gallery above featuring the latter, the sticker on the box isn't guaranteed.

          "description": "Despite not having a trailer at the main Xbox and Bethesda showcase this weekend, eagle-eyed viewers may have spotted a popular survival title alongside the 2023 Xbox releases in an image near the show's end. Today it was confirmed that inclusion was very intentional, as Valheim is not only coming to Game Pass on PC this fall but will be coming to consoles and will be exclusive to Xbox when it launches in 2023.\n\n\nThe Norse-themed cooperative survival game was released into Early Access on Steam in February of last year when it quickly blew up in popularity, selling over 3 million copies in its first few weeks on sale. For people like myself who never took the plunge on Valheim, its addition to PC Game Pass in a few months is a welcomed sight, as is its inclusion in the Microsoft Store on Windows.\nThe other big news for Valheim is three-fold. First, the game is officially coming to consoles for the first time. There has been talk of its eventuality since controller support was added to the PC version earlier this year, but it's nice to finally have confirmation. When this port does land on Xbox sometime in the first half of 2023, full cross-play will be enabled to team up with any number of PC and console players. Although, no other consoles will be involved since Microsoft has locked down console exclusivity for Valheim, so don't expect to see the game show up on PlayStation or Switch anytime soon.\nIf you can't wait until Valheim joins Game Pass on your Microsoft platform of choice, it's available to purchase right now on Steam.",

To hold fans over, the team released a new cinematic during today's Xbox Games Extended Showcase.\nS.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 was slated to launch on December 2, but development was put on hold when the studio became caught in the crossfire of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. GSC Game World is based in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital and some employees have helped defend the city. Given the situation, it seemed increasingly unlikely the game would make it this year, so today’s announcement isn’t totally unexpected. Although GSC is still working out of Kyiv, most of the game's development has resumed at a new office established in Prague, Czech Republic.\nMeanwhile, a new trailer further establishes S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2's gloomy atmosphere.  \n\n\nIn addition, a developer diary documents the state of GSC Game World during the start of Russia's invasion and how it banded together amidst days of bombings (contains disturbing imagry of the war so viewer discretion is advised).\n\n\nS.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl will launch on Xbox Series X/S and PC.",

Moving away from other classic heavyweights like Doom and Wolfenstein, Rare's acclaimed James Bond FPS opted for aesthetic realism, intense single-player campaign levels, deep stealth mechanics with cognizant AI, and, of course, PvP deathmatch. GoldenEra, an upcoming GoldenEye 007 documentary, spotlights the development of the influential FPS. \n\n\nThe trailer, uploaded on IGN, features snippets of developer insight into the creation of GoldenEye 007. Designers stated that, at one point, FPS titles were primarily made for PC audiences. GoldenEye, of course, made waves when it found critical and commercial success on consoles. Next-gen game-changers like Halo and Call of Duty, then, were directly informed by the tight gunplay and combat mechanics of GoldenEye. Be sure to watch the trailer above for more insight. \nGoldenEra will be available digitally this month on June 27.\n[Source: IGN]",

A new game plus option was implemented months ago, and optimization updates keep the gameplay fine-tuned and responsive. Post-launch plans continue to be underway as a new update – 1.4.0 – drops today with the first \"Chapter,\" bringing photo mode and new zombies to the open-world parkour adventure. \nSo, what are the most significant features coming to the game today? A post on the Dying Light website details the introduction of a new NPC named Harper, a rank system to help players build a rapport with Harper as they complete his tasks, daily/weekly bounties, more high-tier gear, two new currencies, never-before-seen infected enemies like the Mutated Infected, Volatile Tyrant, and Volatile Hive, and a time trial Chapter Mission. \nOf course, there's also the photo mode (only available in single-player) that comes with filters, special effects, and more. Other tweaks are incoming to help balance and streamline the fun – we're talking gameplay, co-op, UI/UX, and technical updates. Read all about it by clicking the link in the previous paragraph. \nLike its prequel, Dying Light 2 Stay Human is set to get much developer support even as Techland begins developing its new fantasy action-RPG. So, eager Pilgrims will have many opportunities to expand upon Aiden's already-harrowing journey.\nWill you be diving into the 1.4.0 update today?

          "description": "Capcom leveraged its summer showcase event today to reveal some new details on Exoprimal, the upcoming action and shooting game in which players control warriors in exosuits as they fight off rampaging hordes of dinosaurs. An out-of-control AI called Leviathan is unleashing these dinosaurs through rifts in the sky, and forcing humans to fight them off in intricate (and frankly inexplicable) wargames – usually at high risk of death and destruction of urban landscapes.\nExoprimal's main event is called Dino Survival, where you join up in a multiplayer team of five and compete against another team to complete very specific objectives.\n\n\nThose mission objectives are varied and dynamic. In Dinosaur Cull, your team must hunt and take down one specific dinosaur. VTOL Defense demands that your team protect an aircraft on the ground as it gets swarmed by the charging reptiles. Data Key Security is an escort-style mission, in which you must deliver a particular asset from one location to the next. Omega Charge is a mission in which players have access to a swarm-clearing Omega Hammer. And Energy Taker, as you might suspect, is all about gathering more energy than the opposing team.\nInterestingly, Exoprimal will include sequences where you directly engage enemy players, but also moments where you team up to take down especially dangerous threats. No matter who you’re fighting against, you’ll earn XP to power up both your player character and their exosuit levels.\nCapcom shared that Exoprimal will soon enter a closed network test, which should allow players to get a taste of the action. If you’re interested, you can sign up at exoprimal.com.\nExoprimal is targeting a release on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, and Steam, sometime in 2023.",

          "description": "Today during the Capcom Showcase livestream, the company touched base on its recently-announced Resident Evil 4 remake – including showing all of a few seconds of gameplay. Admittedly, especially coming off the other deep dives of the presentation, it was pretty disappointing. \nDirector Yasuhiro Anpo and producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi led the presentation, filling players in on the story of RE4 and talking about how the game is both a reimagining of the source material and a faithful adaptation. Set six years after the events of Resident Evil 2 and 3, RE4 protagonist Leon Kennedy is now the personal bodyguard of the United States president. When the president's daughter goes missing, Leon is dispatched to a remote European village to find her. As you might expect, things don't go well. \n\n\nWe then see our first look at gameplay, and to be clear, visually, it looks great. The footage is set during the very beginning of the game, when Leon arrives outside the village in the forest. Compared to the original game, the forest is far darker and scarier. \"We want to nail the feeling of loneliness and fear of not knowing what lies ahead, even more so than the original,\" Hirabayashi said during the presentation. \"Of course, there will also be thrilling battles.\"\nYou'd be excused if you expected a glimpse at those thrilling battles, but unfortunately, no such look came. Our look at gameplay ends as Leon walks up to a house in the middle of the forest – which ostensibly is where Leon encounters the first Ganado, as is the case in the original RE4. \nI'm more excited for the Resident Evil 4 remake than any other game we currently know about; the original is one of my all-time favorite games. Which makes this reveal fairly disappointing. I would've loved an actual look at the game, but that wasn't in the cards today. Here's hoping we'll get a better look in the future.",

          "description": "Resident Evil Village made a surprise return during today's Capcom Showcase. After revealing the game has sold over six million copies worldwide, Capcom revealed a Gold Edition is on the way, boasting a number of notable additions. First up is a new story expansion called Shadows of Rose, which puts Rose in the lead for a mind-bending journey of discovery.\n\n\nIn this story, Rose, who is the daughter of Ethan, is in her teens or twenties. From the outset of play, you learn she's struggling with her powers. To try and control them, she enters the consciousness of the Megamycete and that's where the madness begins. Time and space are warped and she sees someone that looks just like her. The entire game is set from the third-person perspective.\nCapcom is adding that new viewpoint to the core game, allowing players to see Ethan and experience the game much like Resident Evil 4 with over-the-shoulder aiming.\nLastly, Mercenaries mode is getting fleshed out with new missions and playable characters like Chris Redfield, Alcina Dimitrescu, and Karl Heisenberg. Lady Dimitrescu stands in at over nine feet in height.\nIf you already played through Resident Evil Village, you won't have to buy this Gold Edition and will just need to get the new Winter's Expansion, which contains all three additions.

          "description": "After a release in Asian markets last month, the overhaul of PlayStation Plus is available today in North and South America. Here's everything you'll need to know about upgrading your plan.\nThree tiers are now available, offering larger numbers of features, games, and trials to play as you go up in pricing, which is available in one-month, three-month, and 12-month subscriptions. Brief descriptions of what you get in each tier can be found below. \nUpgrading is fairly painless but will require a prorated upcharge to join the new Extra or Premium plans of PlayStation Plus. To do so, go to your PS+ tab on your PlayStation console. There, you'll find an option to upgrade. On PS5, it showed each tier and how much money it would cost to upgrade for the remainder of the month, which for most should only be a few dollars. Upon upgrading, it will tell you your next payment date and that it will charge you for a full-year subscription on that day. Don't panic. There is a way to change your subscription type. \nHow To Change Your Subscription Type From Yearly To Monthly\nThere are various ways of getting to your subscription settings, but here is the most foolproof. Go to the Settings menu for your PlayStation console, select Users and Accounts > Accounts > Payment and Subscriptions > Subscriptions. In there, you'll find your PS+ subscription. Once you've entered your subscription details, you can change your plan. \nSelecting Change Plan will give you the three tiers of PlayStation Plus to choose from. Picking any of them will bring you to another screen that will finally allow you to choose the length of subscription you'd like to pay for on a recurring basis. \nOnce you've locked in your desired subscription tier and timeframe, you're ready to enjoy all of the benefits that are now available to you, and you can rest easy knowing you're not locked in for an unexpected charge next month.",

Rotwood is a multiplayer action game, and it's expected to enter early access at some point, but that date is up in the air for now.\n\n\nThanks to the Steam description, we know a little more about Rotwood than what was revealed in the trailer. It's a roguelike dungeon crawler designed to be played with up to four people. Each run will bring your cute animal avatars through a dangerous forest where the challenge amplifies the deeper you go in. New armor and weapons can be crafted from items scavenged, and a safe haven can be built up and fortified as well.\nIn typical Klei style, the hand-drawn look of the characters and enemies is unreal. Once again, the studio is pushing the boundaries of making it look like you're controlling a cartoon character; Rotwood's models are expressive, fluid, and bursting with personality. I can't wait to see what Rotwood looks and plays like in action when I can eventually get my hands on it.\nThe trailer gave an early access date of \"202?\" which could be anytime in the next decade, though I'd expect us to play it well before 2030. Rotwood can be wishlisted on Steam, and it's unknown whether Klei is planning for release on any additional platforms at this time.",

You can watch the trailer below for yourself, along with an interview with series creator and industry luminary Warren Spector.\n\n\nThis new trailer for System Shock gives a great look at the game's visual style, which toes the line of using modern graphical techniques while paying homage to the low-res look of the original game. More specifically, some of the in-game panels and monitors are intentionally blocky and pixelated, as if they were textures from a 90s first-person shooter. SHODAN, the antagonistic AI who is ever-present in System Shock, is also a prominent feature in the trailer as she talks smack to the player as they explore the Citadel Station.\nSystem Shock is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.",

The Alters is a sci-fi adventure where one man trying to survive and get home from a mission that's gone wrong finds all the help he needs in himself. Or rather, himselves.\n\n\n \nJan Dolski, the main character, turns to The Alters, or alternate versions of himself that differ from him in ways that will help them all survive. The Alters each have different skills and character traits, so even though they all look like Jan, they'll fill specific roles in the mission to get home. The trailer shows Jan and The Alters' ship, a giant wheel-like craft with a series of shipping container units held together at the center.\nDuring the presentation, 11 Bit Studios' Lead Artist Tomasz Kisikewicz says the game has aspects of a psychological thriller, with a dash of horror, but also obviously deals with surrealism. He also says this lands in a \"classic sci-fi\" story by taking a relatable topic and applying these fictional science solutions like creating alternate selves, but the gameplay is contemporary with a focus on system design and non-linear gameplay. It's designed for players to create their own stories.\n \n\nIt seems like it's far too early for a release date, but we do know The Alters will be coming to PC whenever it does end up launching.",

What was shown is compelling, and it may be an understatement to say, but this game looks stunning.\n\n\nThe demo begins from the perspective of Yasna, a hazmat-suited explorer as she ventures into a dusty and irradiated facility. Her cohort Novik supports her on comms as she delves deeper into the mysterious local. She soon comes across a deactivated Antimatter cannon and later a robot looping a task it's been engaged in for who knows how long. The tech of The Invincible is retro-futuristic, which gives the rundown facility and gadgets Yasna uses a lot of character and charm. Yasna pulls out a handheld tracker with a field of tiny lights and uses it to discover a body buried in the sands beneath her feet, confirming this place isn't at all safe. Then, the antimatter cannon surges to life, takes aim, and blows the robot worker away with a spectacular beam of particles before turning its sights dead on our protagonist.\nI'm not usually one for slow-paced first-person narrative games, but this look at The Invincible had me on the edge of my seat, and I can't wait to see more. The Invincible is coming sometime in 2023 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

It is coming to Xbox consoles and PC this November. \nRevealed during today’s Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase, Pentiment looks like quite the departure from what Obsidian has released over the past few years. Nonetheless, the project looks fascinating. The game features quite a unique visual style that looks reminiscent of an old medieval painting or book. This makes sense, too, because Pentiment is not an RPG like The Outer Worlds or a survival game like the studio’s Grounded, but rather, a narrative adventure game. \nCheck out the trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nHere’s how Xbox describes Pentiment in the YouTube trailer description: \n“Set in 16th century Bavaria, Pentiment will take players on a narrative journey through the eyes of Journeyman Artist Andreas Maler during a time of great social unrest. Led by game director Josh Sawyer, this game is brought to life by a talented team inspired by illuminated manuscripts, woodcut prints, and history itself.” \nPentiment hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC this November. \nWhile waiting for its release, read Game Informer’s review of The Outer Worlds and then read about Obsidian’s next RPG, Avowed.\nAre you excited for Pentiment?

From barren moons to heavily populated worlds, you can go where you want to see what you discover.\nThe first locale we see is a moon called Kreet, which is stark in detail with rocky grain terrains and brief flares of color with red plants. In this regard, the color scheme is similar to Star Wars' Crait from The Last Jedi. Here, we are given our first taste of gameplay, which we see from bo…",

Today, it revealed Ereban: Shadow Legacy, a game where you must harness mystical shadow powers and use high-tech gadgets to uncover the truth about your past to save the universe.\nIn the trailer, the main character, Ayana, who channels some serious Tron energy with her attire, confronts big mechs. Apparently, Ayana is the last descent of a forgotten race and is key to saving this dying, morally grey universe. The gameplay footage showed her stealthily outsmarting big machines and using an array of powers. She can also stab them through the head, so that's pretty cool. She even takes some big falls from huge heights, reminiscent of Assassin's Creed. Watch the trailer above to get the full scoop.\nEreban: Shadow Legacy will launch day one on Xbox Game Pass. No release date was revealed.",

During the platform's Summer Game Fest event today, we got our first glimpse at a new project from Limbo and Inside lead designer Jeppe Carlsen.\nCocoon, published by Annapurna Interactive, which has a showcase of its own next month, promises to be a mind-bending experience with an undeniably compelling art style. The creators promise to take players \"on an adventure across worlds within worlds,\" which are represented by a series of unusual glowing orbs in the trailer. The clip begins with a sweeping and stylized view of a desert landscape which is soon disturbed by a blinding beam of white light. Our hero pops out of a mechanical-looking cocoon energized by the laser and appears to be a kind of beetle. We mostly see it grabbing and distributing globes of various colors, which may allow it to jump to different locations.\n\n\n There's not a lot to glean from this reveal trailer, but the game's Steam page goes into a little more detail. \nCocoon is set to release on Xbox consoles (via Game Pass), Switch, and PC sometime in 2023. The trailer's description indicates fans should get ready to \"master world-leaping mechanics to unravel a cosmic mystery.\"",

Some of these story moments could lead to massive boss battles that require numerous players.\n\n\nDiablo IV offers cross-play between console and PC, and also two-player couch play for people in the same household. If you play a bunch and become incredibly powerful, the game will highlight you as a champion, which other players can see.

The reveal trailer, which you can watch below, doesn’t feature any gameplay but it gave us quite the taste of Fallen Dynasty’s world.\n\n\nAs you can see in the trailer above, the character that appears to be the protagonist of Fallen Dynasty is fighting off barbarian enemies before consuming something that turns them into a massive demon dragon monster that looks terrifying. Here’s what the trailer description for Fallen Dynasty says about the game: \nIt looks great, albeit a little scary, and fortunately, we don’t have to wait too long to check it out because Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC in early 2023. \nFor more, read Game Informer’s Nioh review, and then check out our thoughts on Nioh 2 after that. \nAre you excited for Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty?

          "description": "Ebb Software showed a new trailer for Scorn at today’s Xbox Games Showcase, and the first-person horror adventure continues to look just as disturbing as ever.\nDrawing clear lines of inspiration from the famous artist, H.R. Giger, Scorn features some of the same disconcerting imagery that is a part of the art from movies like Alien, in which biological and mechanical elements seem to merge.\nThe new trailer continues to embrace those elements, with more than a little bit of body horror mixed in for good measure. The video shows numerous instances of disconnected human appendages attached to strange, non-human machines and creatures. And the protagonist appears to be horribly mutilated in the brief glimpses we get of their arms and other body parts.\nEbb has stated in the past that Scorn is aiming for a cohesive “lived-in” world, in which players are thrown in the deep-end by arriving and having to try and grasp what is even happening in the spaces they explore. Environments are said to be maze-like and individual regions are open and exploreable, but interconnected with other distinct spaces.\nThe developers are also touting the game’s focus on full-body awareness. Rather than have items simply floating in the world and having them picked up by magic, every object is a real thing that your character must lift or move with their own hands, hopefully leading to a greater sense of immersion. And, given the subject matter, a likely greater sense of disquiet.\nWhile the environment and creature design is certainly impressive, I continue to have a number of questions about the nature of gameplay in the project. I’m eager to understand more about the nature of the puzzles and characters that are part of the surreal game world, but this latest trailer does little to illuminate either.\nScorn is headed to Xbox Game Pass, but more generally will be available on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, and on the Cloud when it releases on October 21, 2022.",

Today, at the Xbox Games Showcase, it was not only confirmed, but a high-speed trailer featuring the toy cars from our childhoods whizzed across the screen on the tracks and red loops we've come to know. You can watch the trailer above. The expansion hits on July 19. \nPREVIOUS STORY\nAccording to Eurogamer, Forza Horizon 5’s first expansion – a Hot Wheels crossover – leaked on the Steam store listing and was immediately taken down. The listing was posted to Reddit, where it gained traction. You can see the image of the crossover below. \nThis wouldn’t be the first time the two car-racing giants joined forces. Hot Wheels DLC packages sped onto the scenic tracks of Forza Motorsport 5 and Forza Horizon 3 and 4. What Playground Games has in store with its latest arcade racing simulator is anyone’s guess. \nForza Horizon 5 cracked Game Informer’s Top 10 Games of 2021 list: \n“To merely say Forza Horizon 5 is among the most mechanically sound racing games ever created would be a disservice and overlook what makes the game worthy of praise. Yes, the foundational act of driving feels fantastic, but it’s the rest of the package that truly elevates this fifth entry in the series to the rarified air that demands a place on our list of the top 10 games of the year.”\nAre you excited about the alleged crossover?\n[Source: Eurogamer]",

          "description": "Early in today’s Xbox Game Showcase, Riot Games’ president, Marc Merrill, took a few minutes to announce a big new partnership with Xbox and its Game Pass program. A number of Riot’s biggest experiences are coming to Xbox Game Pass on mobile and PC, with relatively robust options unlocked for players to enjoy.\nFirst, Riot’s flagship property, League of Legends, will see all champions unlocked on PC.\nIn League of Legends: Wild Rift, it’s a similar picture, with all champions unlocked on mobile gaming platforms.\nIn Legends of Runeterra, Game Pass players can expect to have the full Foundations set of cards unlocked. For those not in the know, as the name implies, that’s the foundational cards for the game, establishing the base mechanics. The card set will be available on both PC and mobile.\nIn Teamfight Tactics, players can expect select Little Legends to be unlocked, whether you play on PC or mobile.\nAnd in Valorant, all agents will be unlocked on PC.\nIt’s a notable team-up that should give a boost to both Xbox and Riot. On the Riot side, the availability of so many characters and sets across the spectrum of their games means that a potentially huge audience of Xbox players could have a chance to experience a broad spectrum of what each of those games have to offer. To Xbox’s benefit, it offers a meaningful boost to the already potent draw of Xbox Games Pass as a service and experience, since players can gain access to a number of aspects of each of those Riot games without needing to pay additional costs.\nWhile Riot’s expansion into Game Pass is big news, it’s worth noting that it won’t have much effect for players on Xbox consoles, as all the available options are coming to specific combinations of PC and mobile, depending on titles.\nThe availability of all of these options is said to be coming this winter for Game Pass subscribers.",

As insectoid creature Hornet, your weapon of choice is a needle. The gameplay is said to be largely similar to its predecessor, but with an increased focus on speed.

          "description": "Microsoft and Turn 10 Studios have revealed Forza Motorsport (that’s right – there’s no number attached to this entry in the franchise) with a beautiful trailer. \nRevealed during today’s Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase, Turn 10’s latest motorsport game will hit Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC in spring of next year. The studio calls it the “most technologically advanced racing game ever made.” To highlight these technological advances, the team showcased Maple Valley, a fan-favorite track alongside news that the game will have a dynamic day-and-night cycle, a first for the Motorsport series.\nCheck out the reveal trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nNot to be confused with Playground Games’ Forza Horizon series, Motorsport is closer to a racing sim than it is an arcade racer, making it an especially great time for people who really like to get under the hood of the vehicles they race. To go with that, there’s plenty of environment tech happening in Forza Motorsport to simulate not just how the cars would drive, but how the time of day, the temperature associated with it, and more can affect the race. \nCheck out this demo trailer for more information about that: \n\n\nAll of it looks great thanks to ray-tracing, photorealism techniques, and more. That includes the car damage your vehicle will endure when you hit other drivers or barriers on the track, too. \n \nWhile waiting for it to hit Xbox consoles and PC next year, read Game Informer’s Forza Horizon 5 review. \n \nAre you excited for Forza Motorsport?

          "description": "Squanch Games has announced High On Life, a new first-person shooter from the mind of Rick and Morty creator Justin Roiland. \nSquanch Games revealed High On Life during today’s Xbox gaming showcase, and the first trailer for it highlights talking guns, alien cartels, and plenty of Roiland-style humor. It’s appropriately poppy and colorful, too, and it looks like a great time. Plus, we don’t have to wait too long to play it because it hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC (via Steam and the Epic Games Store) later this year. \n“After a cartel of aliens invades Earth, a freshly minted high-school graduate grabs the nearest talking gun and becomes the deadliest intergalactic bounty hunter across the cosmos,” a press release reads. “The alien invaders in High On Life are on a mission to dominate Earth, but with a particularly sinister twist: Garmantuous and his cartel goons are intent on enslaving humanity and using them as a new drug.\n“[Defeating] powerful aliens isn’t going to be easy; bounty hunters will work with (or against) NPCs, collect upgrades, and acquire an arsenal of talking guns on their journey. Each of these guns has its own unique personality and special gameplay, and they provide their own narrative take on what’s going on.” \n\nSquanch Games’ studio director Mike Fridley says to expect Roiland’s comedic voice to tie this game together with all of the studio’s other outputs. He says the studio wants players to look at any of its games and immediately know it’s a Squanch game. \n“I wanted to make games that I wanted to play, and that was the spark that sort of lit the fire of Squanch Games,” Roiland writes in a press release. “Then we shipped Trover, we shipped Accounting+, and now we’re on this absolute dream game that we were kind of building towards this whole time.” \nFor more, read Game Informer’s Trover Saves The Universe review and catch up on all the biggest gaming news from Summer Game Fest 2022 and other June showcases. \nAre you excited about High On Life?

Up to four players team up as a band of survivors who must fight back and escape Redfall with their lives intact. \n\n\nThe crew consists of protagonist Layla, who wields telekinesis, the sniper Jacob, the engineer Remy (with a cute robot companion in tow), and cryptid hunter Devinder. The gameplay trailer shows how these four combine their abilities to combat hordes of undead, such as Layla creating a telekinetic elevator to launch an ally skyborne. \nRedfall releases in early 2023 for Xbox Series X/S and PC and will launch day one on Game Pass.",

Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.\nA detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.\nThank you very much for your support!\n>",

You will need a daily development build. As always, please submit the bug reports to our issue tracker. \nPlease note that the ScummVM version does have one major outstanding issue: the music used by the game is in a custom format we've been unable to properly support yet.

          "description": "A few days ago, Google announced the list of students accepted for this year's Google Summer of Code.\nWe are very proud to welcome 4 students this year who will be working on various parts of the project during the upcoming months.\nPragyansh Chaturvedi (aka Raikou) will work on improving our DIRECTOR engine. His effort will help us to allow support for many 90s-era adventure games made with the Macromedia Director authoring tools. By implementing more internal functions used by DIRECTOR, Pragyansh's main objective is to extend support for Meet Mediaband and The Journeyman Project (Win and Mac), making them fully playable without any glitches.\nMichael Hayman (aka Quote58) is about to implement support for The Immortal. The game (released in 1990) can be described as a mix of genres involving RPG elements with action and puzzles. Many changes across different game variants (written in pure assembly code!) will make this an interesting challenge. This project is a continuation of a GSoC task initially started by a former student back in 2018.\nEmanuele Grisenti (aka grisenti) will be working on a new engine, HPL1. The original sources for this engine got recently released by the original developer Frictional Games under GPLv3. The purpose of this project is to achieve a full port of this engine to ScummVM, with the goal of supporting the 2007 survival game Penumbra: Overture.\nAvijeet Maurya (aka StableSteady) will pick up several incomplete engines: MacVenture, Avalanche, Glk-Scott, Pink and WAGE. Some of these engines are very close to completion, but not quite there yet. The main objective of Avijeet's task is to identify all missing features and fix existing bugs. The goal for his project is to bring the above engines to a stable state.\nThe team is very excited about the upcoming weeks – and we hope you are as well.\nPlease give a warm welcome to our new students! Let's make GSoC 2022 a huge success – together!\n>",
