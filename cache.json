          "description": "\"Time to make a comeback!\".\nThose of you who picked up the Switch during its launch period in the distant early days of 2017 may remember that, believe it or not, there were other games available at launch besides Breath of the Wild. One of those games was Super Bomberman R, which at the time was the title that broke the longest dry spell (nearly a decade) between releases in the long-running Bomberman franchise. Super Bomberman R sold relatively well considering the distinct niche it filled in the Switch library at the time, and after a rather ill-fated attempt to make a free-to-play version of that game for all platforms, Konami has now returned once again to the well with Super Bomberman R 2. At its core, this new release is little else than simply more Bomberman, but that’s hardly a bad thing when the gameplay feels this enjoyable.\nSuper Bomberman R 2 is fundamentally intended to be experienced as a party game, the kind of thing you play on a couch with a few friends while you shout unworthy things at each other as you repeatedly blow everyone up. Matches take place on a 13x11 grid viewed from a top-down perspective and the goal is simply to be the last (Bomber)man standing. You remove your opponents by placing timed bombs that send out plus-shaped blasts after a couple of seconds, though you have to be careful because you can easily blow yourself up if you don’t plan out your placement well.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The reports from both Eurogamer and VGC suggested that the console showcased an improved version of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, though details were sparse on what these improvements actually entailed. Well, the rumour mill has continued to churn and more reported details are now being shared.\nThe latest rumours come from a recent Nate the Hate podcast in which the host claims to have been told that the Gamescom tech demo saw BOTW running at 4K 60fps, with the emphasis of the show being that \"load times had been erased\". Again, this is not to suggest that the Switch launch title will be re-released with the next hardware, only that it was being used to demonstrate to showcase the successor's technical improvements.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

What's exciting about this one is that it is set to bring all nine of the 3DS' download-only Picross e games with it — so if you missed out on the chance to download them before their eShop closed, this will be your chance to snatch them up.\nThe base content (which contains the puzzles from Picross e) will be available for £3.99 / €4,99 / $4.99, with each subsequent entry in the 3DS series becoming available as individual additional paid content packages priced at the same cost. It might seem like a slightly expensive way of bringing each game over to the modern console, but that's a whole lot of puzzle for your pounds.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

'Video games' — plastic, square-shaped cartridges that millions of people blow into every day — grip early-adopting proselytizers. Yet they don’t know their precious cartridge’s days are numbered. A mighty company from Kyoto rules the industry today, but a new laser-based challenger is lurking in the bushes.\nIs it the mighty Sony PlayStation? No, not for another three years. Is it the Sega CD? Well, actually, that’s coming in a couple of days. But today, on December 3rd, 1991, the Philips CD-i has arrived.

          "description": "Zero to hero.\nThough Capcom hasn’t necessarily abandoned the Mega Man brand as a whole, it’s indisputably reduced how often it produces new games in that celebrated franchise. For example, it’s been 19 years since the last new Mega Man X release (and let’s be real, X8 was a rough entry to end on), but that series now lives on in the efforts of its fans. A few years ago, Battery Staple Games released 20XX, a cute roguelite take on Mega Man gameplay, and now it’s followed up that effort with 30XX. It isn’t without issues, but we’re happy to report that 30XX feels like an overall improvement over its predecessor, and stands as a worthy homage to a beloved series.\nGameplay in 30XX follows the template of classic Mega Man X. You run ‘n’ gun through eight themed levels capped off with a tough boss fight, collecting new weapons or abilities each time you beat another boss, then challenge some extra tough final stages. The gimmick here, however, is that 30XX is structured like a roguelite, so each stage is different each run and there are myriad upgrades you can collect along the way to help even the odds a little bit. There are two playable characters, named Ace and Nina, and they take after Zero and X, respectively. Both have their pros and cons, though we generally preferred Nina’s ranged gameplay over Ace’s sword-swinging skills.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Id Software's 1997 shooter was fancied up with a remaster released as a free update in August, complete with all the old stuff and one notable new addition. MachineGames, the studio behind the modern Wolfenstein games, have created a whole new story campaign for the remaster. I've really enjoyed playing it. It's the old Quake 2 you know and have complicated feelings about, filtered through modern design sensibilities.

          "description": "The Creative Assembly and SEGA's Total War: PHARAOH has a release date, 11th October 2023. There's also a physical limited edition coming to Europe on 23rd October, for those of you who revel in such things as portraits of faction leaders, packs of cosmetics and posters of the game's campaign map, which you can also check out in the new campaign flyover video below.\r\n\n\r\nIn case you're wondering, I've checked with the authorities and yes, PHARAOH should be written in all capitals, making a laughing stock of all previous RPS reporting. If it feels unnatural, try to imagine that you're bellowing the game's title from the summit of a pyramid, so as to remind your embattled subjects of your magnificence. RPS boss Katharine behaves similarly in morning meetings. \"EDITOR-IN-CHIEF,\" she roars at us repeatedly, until somebody rushes her the daily traffic reports, a steaming goblet of sphinx eggs and a gif of a crafty kill in Shadow Gambit.\r\n\n Read more",

          "description": "\"Usually, when a player is going through a strategy game, they figure out how things work by trial and error,\" Total War: Pharaoh's game director Todor Nikolov tells me at this year's Gamescom. \"And once they do, they feel the urge to start a brand-new campaign because they've already figured out that portion of the gameplay.\"\nSitting across the table, these words ring frighteningly true for me. Unbeknownst to Nikolov, he has just described the exact experience I had playing the 50-turn campaign preview for Pharaoh a week earlier to an absolute tee. Unlike the far more knowledgeable brain of frequent RPS contributor Nic Reuben, I am a complete babe in arms when it comes to the Total War juggernaut machine, and it took me attempting to play two other games in the series (Three Kingdoms and Troy) and several restarts in Pharaoh itself before I felt just about confident that I (very vaguely) knew what I was doing. At the time, I thought, 'Man alive, how is Total War still so rubbish at teaching players how it works?' But when I speak to Nikolov a week later, he has some very welcome news for me: there's going to be a dedicated tutorial campaign where players can (hopefully) find their feet. Music to my ears.\nRead more",

          "description": "Being a dedicated spacer I've never had much interest in the base construction aspect of Starfield, but that was before I learned that you can spacewalk by means of console commands, aka cheats. Reddit user WeirdConcern4666 made history on this front yesterday. Here's how you do it: 1) get up from the cockpit controls, 2) hit the tilde key to open the command console at the bottom of the screen, 3) type \"player.setpos x 10\" to teleport your character outside the ship, then hit return and 4) type \"setgravityscale 0\" to engage zero gravity and stop your character plummeting endlessly. Then hit the tilde key again to close the command console, and well, there you go.\nSpace sure is bigger outside a spaceship, isn't it? Just as well you brought that jetpack. If your vessel of choice is on the bulky side, like mine, you might need to increase the number on the end of \"player.setpos\" to escape the invisible barriers around your craft's exterior. Witness my character Mary Read's first attempts at a spacewalk below. If you've somehow discarded your jetpack, you can always punt yourself about with the recoil from an appropriately chunky firearm.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "I don't know about you, but after spending 100+ hours in both Assassin's Creed Odyssey and Assassin's Creed Valhalla, I'm well up for an AC game that reins its open world in a bit and goes back to the sort-of single city stab-athon the series used to be. The ones where stealth actually mattered, and you felt like a proper assassin working from the shadows. Assassin's Creed Mirage is all this to a tee - as Ubisoft have taken great pains to remind us over the last year as they gear up to celebrate the series' 15th anniversary. \nAnd after spending three hours playing some of its early mission sequences, I can confirm this is very much a game whose sole purpose is to scratch that nostalgic itch good and proper (before we inevitably hurl ourselves into the still very ambiguous void of whatever the heck Assassin's Creed Infinity is). If, however, you don't have much fondness for those older games, and prefer the more action-oriented RPG-ing of recent Creeds, Mirage is probably going to feel like a step backward from all the things you know and like - and you may be better off waiting until the next big open world entry set in feudal Japan pitches up instead.\nRead more",

You needed Steam to access it, whether you bought the digital version or a retail copy. Given relative unfamiliarity with digital distribution, the nascent status of broadband internet in the UK and US, and the much greater importance of physical game sales at the time, this caused quite a stir. I remember being alarmed by an op-ed over on GameRevolution.com that held forth at length about the risk of conflicts between Steam and other software, if players were outright required to leave it running. How quaint those anxieties seem today - the day of Steam's 20th anniversary. And yet, there's nothing quaint about Steam's ability to shape the field in which it operates.\nRead more",

On one side of the wall lies what is called the diegetic space of the game, aka the fictitious world, which is generally the aspect that receives the most interest, the aspect that tends to attract the weasel word \"immersive\". On the other side of the wall lie menus, settings and other features that form a non-diegetic layer of bald operator functions - technical conveniences and lists of things to tweak or customise, from graphics modes to character inventory, that are cut adrift in a vacuum outside of time. \r\n\n\r\nIn theory, the pause screen and its contents are not truly part of the game. There is no temporality, no sense of place, no threat, no possibility of play, no character or narrative, no save the princess, no press X to Jason or pay respects, no gather your party before travelling forth. As the scholar Madison Schmalzer points out in the paper I'm wonkily paraphrasing here, \"the language of the menu itself emphasizes the menu's position as outside of gameplay by labeling the option to continue as 'resume game.' The game world is always privileged as the site that gameplay happens.\" \r\n\n \nRead more",

Everybody had a deck of playing cards in their pocket for cheeky 15 minute rounds of Texas Hold 'Em between lessons, with Milky Way segments and Niknaks wagered in place of chips. Yes, I'm aware I'm starting to sound like Grandpa Simpson, and no, this wasn't from some murky era before the invention of videogames. It was the heyday of the Gameboy Advance! I'm not sure what we were thinking. But two things: 1) decks of playing cards are cheaper than game consoles, and 2) part of the fun, possibly, was that nobody really knew how to play the ostensibly well-known cardgames we were playing.\nWith the benefit of hindsight, I suspect there may have been creative liberties taken with the rules at times. I knew hair-pulling wasn't a legal move in professional poker. Anyway, I'm reminded of all this by Dungeons & Degenerate Gamblers, a warped and mildly satirical, 90s-styled take on Blackjack from Purple Moss Collectors.\nRead more",

          "description": "AMD's Radeon RX 6800 and 6800 XT graphics cards have proven surprisingly popular even into 2023, as new price drops (and relatively modest gen-on-gen performance increases for newer models) has left them as competitive options in terms of value for money. \nToday we've got a deal on the RX 6800 non-XT, with an MSI model going for just under $400 at Newegg. That's a $70 reduction from its usual price and $20 cheaper than the cheapest RX 6800 model on Amazon. That's an awesome deal for a strong 1440p graphics card that comes with a copy of Starfield Premium Edition (which includes the Shattered Space story expansion, a digital art book, the game's OST and a few weapon/suit skins on top of the base game). \nRead more",

I've only played about two hours of it so far, but it's clear there's still a lot more to discover within its dreamy little vignettes. It's one of those games that's designed to be played multiple times to get the full extent of the story, and I've just hit the first of those Nier Automata-esque restarts. Honestly, I'm not quite sure what to think of it yet, but one thing is certain: I can't get it out of my head.\nRead more",

          "description": "Announced earlier this year at Summer Game Fest, Islands Of Insight is, somehow, both an open world multiplayer game, and a puzzle game - something akin to The Witness but in a fantasy world you share with other players. There are serene floating islands, wide open flying and a varied chocolate box of puzzles. Publisher Behaviour Interactive (from Dead By Daylight fame) have now announced a free open playtest, available to everyone from now until September 21st. As lovely as the game looks, I’m excited to try Islands Of Insight for myself. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Although most of my favourite films are tragedies, games with a grim and heavy premise don't often appeal to me as much as you'd think. I wasn't quite expecting to enjoy The Man Came Around, then, as it's about a group of desperate people trying to cross the border to escape their authoritarian government. In Winter, no less.\nIt's actually rather light in practice, although not in a flippant or trivialising way. The message is clearly that these things are serious and our sympathies should be, well, basic concern for the wellbeing of other people. But it's not as miserable to play as games with such serious themes often are. The premise is serious, but the act of playing it is not. I'd call it \"diverting\" rather than \"entertaining\", but the bottom line is there's a good afternoon or two in there for you.\nRead more",

I spent most of my hour-long demo session steadily working my way through its extensive tutorial, as I have not, in fact, played Cities: Skylines before now - although I can at least confirm that its tutorial is very newbie-friendly, and that I now feel more prepared to give it a go properly when it comes out in full on October 24th.\nBut the thing that really impressed me was just the sheer scope of its playable spaces. We've known since the end of July that its maps are roughly 5x bigger than those in the first game, and when I saw Colossal Order's Maps & Themes video, I thought, 'Yes, those sure look enormous!' But actually seeing them in person really put things into perspective for me, especially when I tried zooming the camera out and it just kept going and going and going and… \nRead more",

In this foetid offering from Argentinian devs Andrés Borghi and Tobías Rusjan of Saibot Studios, you play a young woman, Julia, who is visiting her film-maker ex-boyfriend to drop off their old apartment key. Julia’s having a hard time getting over the break-up, but she’s clearly doing better than her ex: his apartment is full of broken glass, anomalous red gloop and creepy occult books. \r\n\n\r\nThe game’s twist is that it’s two visual styles thrust into the same frame. On the one hand, you'll explore an 8-bit world of unpleasantly bright colours, finding and combining objects adventure-game-style. I say adventure-game-style, because this is a bit more energetic than most adventure games – you can equip and swing a wrench, and there’s a run button. On the other hand, well.

It's possible the game contains an orbital shipyard of some kind - if you've found one, don't spoil! - but at the time of writing, any vessel I abandon is essentially gone for good. \r\n\n\r\nMy first trophy as greenhorn orbital bandit Mary Read was a UC Transpo, which isn't so much a spaceship as a shoebox with toilet roll tubes and detergent bottles glued to the outside, its ordnance limited to a single laser. I began my second leg confidently expecting to spend many hours in this Fisher Price starmobile, vainly searching for a wounded battlecruiser or an abandoned solar yacht or some other, more capable vessel accessible to a space pirate of extremely modest means.

I know it can sometimes seem like writing about these games - particularly on RPS - feels like we're somehow neglecting everything else going on in PC gaming.

It's your own card units that are the ones moving along pre-defined tracks wreaking havoc on stationary enemies, not the other way around. Maybe tower assault would be a better term, but that's by the by. Served with a dollop of anime froth on the top, Affogato should be my exact cuppa joe.

          "description": "Oft' am I struck by the fact that video game homes belonging to characters in the depths of despair are nicer that all of the homes I've lived in myself. Granted, I'm a thirty-something in a country with a years-long housing crisis, so even the Baker House in Resident Evil 7 is of \"I think I could just about afford that one day\" status. But it comes to something when a 70s depresso-capsule at the bottom of the sea has more square footage and storage space than I do.\nUnder The Waves (which got patched today, and not before time because I've had one fatal error crash per play session since it came out last week so far) is about a deep sea diver called Stan, who is living and working at the bottom of a big wet metaphor for grief. You will know this because a) its Steam page says this up front, and b) it's not super subtle (this game is published by Quantic Dream). But, as newsman Edwin pointed out to me today, when was the last time the sea wasn't a metaphor for grief? It's never a metaphor for enjoying a nice raspberry ripple ice cream. And despite Stan making reference to \"what [he's] been through\" half an hour in, I think it does a great job with its chthonic sadness. You float about in your tiny little sub in a great misty darkness, listen to the extremely melancholy music, and you start thinking about sad stuff in your own life. But you get into Stan's capsule living area and you think \"this guy has a carpet and a book nook, what the hell?\"\nRead more",

The nearest I got to playing 40K as a lad was its Battlefleet Gothic spin-off (which none of my friends were interested in, so when I say \"playing\", I mean that I sat in a room staring glumly at some unpainted Lunar-class Cruisers while other kids went out and climbed trees). The framing I'm working with instead, based on an hour of hands-off Rogue Trader gameplay, is that it's sort of Warhammer Mass Effect, but with XCOM-style turn- and grid-based combat, and while there are opportunities to be a compassionate hero, you fundamentally only have the option of playing Renegade.

Rather, this is a game that's designed to unfurl slowly, bit by bit, over the course of several hours, and before we begin, developer Frame Break's CEO Joakim Hedström tells me they've shortened the game's opening sequence for this particular demo, just so they can get players right into the thick of things as quickly as possible. \nBut even on this whistlestop tour, there's plenty to dig into and delight in here - not least its gloriously bright and inviting colour palette (take that, Todd).

Do you yearn for the older, simpler days before the great Unrealification and the invention of sex scenes, when people called a spike pit a spike pit, and you could count all the different colours in a screenshot on your fingers? Do you, in fact, reject this framing of retro-styled 2D pixelart games as \"older\" and \"simpler\", regarding it as condescending and false? Look, shut up already.

          "description": "Ring the bell, everybody, it's time for another round of game developers telling players that they don't really understand what a \"game engine\" is. The spark this time is little-known science fiction adventure Starfield, which I believe we've reported on before. The game has a few obvious foibles - in my experience as a space pirate, NPCs sometimes struggle to navigate their surroundings, and then there are those stark disconnects between planetary surfaces and orbital space. Hiccups such as these have led a few players to wonder whether the game might work better using different technology, and in particular, the newer versions of Epic's ubiquitous Unreal Engine. Isn't Bethesda's proprietary Creation Engine, which the company have been updating since 2011, getting a little long in the tooth?\nYou'll find a lot of the discussion below this post from Digital Foundry boffin John Linneman on Twxter, which has attracted both gloating PlayStation fans (remember, Starfield is Xbox-only in console land) and a number of thoughtful replies from some fairly senior game developers. This conversation goes back a fair way, of course - people have been ragging on Bethesda for using \"the same engine\" for years. And there's a definite air of world-weariness to some of the developer responses.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "You may have seen that Alice Bee has started a \"land on every planet\" run of Bethesda's Starfield. By total coincidence - I promise you it's accidental, I was so pleased - I've been working on a \"land on no planets\" run of Starfield. The reasoning for this is as follows: people say that outer space is the worst part of the game, because it's just an irritating interval between the maps where the majority of quests, loot, intrigues, etc are found. It's a fast travel loading screen you can fly about in. But what if you double-down on the space stuff? \r\n\n\r\nWhat if you never descend from orbit, not even to repair, modify or upgrade your ship and offload inventory? What if, rather than buying new ships or building them, you progress exclusively by boarding other captains and making off with ship and cargo? How well does Starfield scrub up as a thoroughbred space sim that leans towards bloodthirsty piracy? Here to answer these questions is Mary Read, my custom character and budding astral freebooter. She's named for her distant ancestor, the legendary 18th century English buccaneer Mary Read. She's had a crack at life on shore, setting foot most recently on Earth's Moon, but from this point on, her fate and fortune lies amid the stars. Arrr!\r\n\n \nRead more",

The new title is a sokoban-style puzzle game, which is to say, it's broadly about shoving crates around, but as the name suggests, Void Stranger has bigger ambitions than helping you while away five minutes over lunch.

For me, the final act of BG3 is the act when all my nonsensing in the rest of the game paid off.

          "description": "I am currently juggling two playthroughs of Starfield with very different aims. While Sayer the Space Scoundrel is having trouble getting around as they engage with the main story, I have started another character to engage in some nonsense (to the extent that there is any in Starfield) - the first of such I've detailed here.\nI've said it before, but you're my very best friend, so we're going to play Starfield together. Join me as we step, wobbly and uncertain like Bambi on ice, into Bethesda's huge and partially procedurally generated space RPG universe for the adventures of Turbo Eclipse (I used an astronaut name generator intended for a child's party), a spacefaring nerd who longs only for the thrill of science. Yes, we're going to visit every planet in Starfield. Or at least as many as possible before I lose every single one of my marbles. And hey, planets look kinda like marbles! Strap in, spacefarers. Let's put this proc gen through its paces.\nRead more",

You play as an enforcer - a moderator of sorts - tasked with keeping the users of Hypnospace in check by reporting any violations you discover on their personal web pages. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "As someone with a general aversion to online competitive modes in games, I'm always grateful when someone, for once, especially in this age of endlessly bland multiplayer experiments, thinks of the solitary solo player. I'm especially grateful when us single player preferers get a knowing nod of acknowledgement in fighting games, too, which are so naturally geared toward pitting your skills against other human beings that anything involving playing against the AI is often either an afterthought or so threadbare that you can't help but feel like you're missing the point. \nBut that's still, for my sins, how I like to consume fighting games when I occasionally play them - which isn't often, I'll admit, for exactly the reasons described above - and so when I sat down for my Mortal Kombat 1 demo session at Gamescom this year, I was pleased to see not just a very slick story mode in attendance, but also a new single player challenge mode called Invasions that publishers Warner Bros described as \"a giant interactive board game\" that \"lent into action RPG\" territory. Its numerous node-based missions looked substantial based on what I played, and the idea of applying a seasonal service model to it, endlessly rotating in new locations and missions every so often - a whole different Invasion, so to speak - is actually something I'd be very much behind. It, that is, I was a) good at Mortal Kombat, and b) the missions I played during my demo weren't quite so… err… boring.\nRead more",

The adventure game's strong premise of a writer magically entering books to steal treasures wore thin across uninteresting puzzles, repetitive crafting, bland combat, and—worst of all for a game about the wonder of words—iffy writing. But once the credits rolled, I realised I had been fooled by its polished looks, and its core development was team was tiny (with a squad of external contributors), leaving me feeling a lot more forgiving.

          "description": "\"Modders will fix it\" is a cliché, but the thing about clichés is they’re rooted in fact. So it is with Starfield, which already has a DLSS mod ready to patch in the class-leading Nvidia upscaler that Bethesda left out in favour of AMD FSR 2.\nIt’s the work of seasoned modder PureDark, previously seen hammering both DLSS and FSR into Skyrim. I’ve tried the Starfield mod and it works rather nicely, granting a visible quality boost on RTX graphics cards while equalling FSR’s ability to smooth out Starfield’s sometimes-tricky performance. Unfortunately (and largely by association), it’s also been dragged into a spot of nasty business, one involving a separate mod for DLSS 3 frame generation and PureDark’s application of DRM.\nRead more",

Especially when I get to the characters saying ‘I love you’ to each other…” Gaider mimes the sickliness of the scene and his own horrified response. “Apparently I did it so well on Baldur’s Gate II that James Ohlen kept handing me this stuff. And, god, I hated it so much.”\nIt’s weird, in fact, that Gaider wound up working on Baldur’s Gate II at all - let alone that he became synonymous with Dragon Age and romanceable companions afterwards. At 27 years old, he ran a hotel in Edmonton, Alberta - the same city where, unbeknownst to him, Bioware was busy making its name. Once it came time to make a sequel to Baldur’s Gate, Bioware cast around for local writers, and a friend recommended Gaider, who had played D&D in the ‘80s before it fell out of fashion.\nRead more",

Well, at the risk of empirically demonstrating that romance is dead, it turns out all that might have been down to a technical problem.

          "description": "One of the bigger Discourse torpedoes aimed at Starfield's glittering hull over the past month has been its strict division between planetary surfaces and outer space. Space sim fanatics were dismayed to learn that you can't actually fly down to the surface of the planets you're orbiting - instead, you hit a button to initiate a loading break and a landing cutscene, which makes outer space feel more like a glorified airlock chamber than, well, outer space. This segmented approach has prompted many unflattering comparisons with No Man's Sky, in which you can manually pilot through the atmosphere. \r\n\n\r\nPlayers and critics were similarly disappointed by the apparent inability to manually fly between planets in different orbits - instead, the game invites you to pick a destination from your star map or while using your spaceship's scanner HUD, with the journey condensed to a cutscene, again. Well, I bring news on this front. You can actually fly \"to\" and perhaps even \"between\" planets in Starfield. But there are some buts. Buts of astronomical dimensions. Onward!\r\n\n \nRead more",

The Xe driver better supports non-x86 CPU architectures, better designed and more performant around their modern integrated and discrete GPUs, and overall is able to make better design choices and improvements in being a clean sheet driver design compared to all the code that has built up in i915 over the years. But for getting the Xe driver upstream even in experimental form, first some necessary DRM scheduler patches need to be ironed out...",

          "description": "The release of Mortal Kombat 1 is nearly upon us! And, just in time for that, the official launch trailer has … well, launched! Included in this most recent trailer is a special focus on historic fighters Reiko (who was introduced in Mortal Kombat 4) in addition to Shang Tsung, who is, interestingly, a pre-order bonus.\n\n\nAs the trailer begins, we hear narration from presumably Liu Kang, who has replaced Raiden as a god of the new timeline. He then utters the most ironic phrase I have ever heard in a game trailer, explaining that he “was free to craft a new era of peace,” followed by about three minutes and forty-five seconds of pure, unbridled evisceration.\n\n\n\n\nIn the trailer, we are shown a preview of the carnage that Reiko can dish out. Taking advantage of the new Kameo Fighters system, he takes a step back while the Kameo Fighter dishes out a boatload of pain. Then, only after brutally shattering the enemy fighter’s leg, Reiko re-enters the fray by sending a giant spear through their chest, pulling it out, only to send it right into their skull. Era of peace? Riiight.\n\n\nShang Tsung, on the other hand, seems just as lethal — if not moreso. In addition to showing off his devastating combos against Liu Kang, the trailer seems to suggest he’s up to his usual shenanigans and will be a significant force against the characters of this franchise-wise universe reset. To reiterate, it’d seem despite his presence in the game’s story, Shang Tsung will only be playable for those who pre-order Mortal Kombat 1, which releases on September 14 for PS5, Xbox Series X, and Nintendo Switch. \n\nThe post Mortal Kombat 1 launch trailer spotlights Reiko and Shang Tsung appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "We take it absolutely for granted these days the convenience Steam affords us. And the start of the digital PC gaming era hits a milestone today as the Valve service celebrates two decades.\n\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, the initial release of Steam occurred on September 12, 2003, which is exactly twenty years ago. Since then, others have followed suit in helping us move towards video games as digital media in the age of the Internet.\n\n\n\nImage via Steam.\n\n\n\nIt would be interesting to see what the site looked like back then. Unfortunately, the data from Wayback Machine only goes back to 2007. However, even then, Steam was not quite the powerhouse we know it today.\n\n\nCD manufacturers hate this one trick\n\n\nIf you look at the website from the first snapshot on Wayback (May 17, 2007), you can see how different it is from what we're used to seeing, showing how many websites looked back then.\n\n\nIgnoring the fact that images are now missing, the olive green is a far cry from the dark blue theme that would become synonymous with the gaming client.\n\n\nYou'll also notice paraphernalia for Half-Life 2, because that's pretty much how Steam started out. It was originally a way for Valve to digitally distribute its own games. Within a few years, it became the market leader in online digital storefronts.\n\n\nIt wasn't well-received at first, but that's all in the past now. Steam is easily the most popular method for downloading and playing PC games these days. Alternatives like GOG and Epic Games Store may owe a debt of gratitude to Gabe Newell and his team, who pretty much just wanted to offer a more convenient way of updating Counter-Strike.\n\nThe post Steam turns 20 today appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Cyberpunk 2077 fans may find the game significantly heavier on their PC hardware than ever before, according to CD Projekt Red's Lead Scene Programmer Filip Pierściński. Ahead of the release of Cyberpunk 2077 2.0, it appears we should brace for the game's performance to change.\n\n\nMore specifically, Pierściński claims that the game will now \"use all [the CPU power] you have,\" with the expected processor workload being around 90% on an eight-core system. Some impressive efficiency numbers, at least on paper. That said, Pierściński was also careful to point out that cooling may become an issue during such an intensive workload. In fact, he recommended that players run performance assessment tools like Cinebench to check whether their systems are stable under these conditions.\n\n\n\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty aims to push your PC to its limit\n\n\nGraphics are, obviously, one of Cyberpunk 2077's strongest features. The game features many visual bells and whistles with full path-tracing enabled, but this doesn't come cheap, hardware-wise. Pierściński's claims are well-timed, as the game will see its second massive visual upgrade with Phantom Liberty. \n\n\nThere's no real reason to doubt what Pierściński is saying, of course. But warning people about their PCs' cooling capabilities over a video game patch is quite curious, all things considered. We'll see how well the game scales with different levels of hardware once update 2.0 hits. After all, this level of efficacy would make Cyberpunk 2077 an even more ubiquitous benchmarking title in the long run. \n\n\nAt this time, there's no official release date available for Cyberpunk 2077 2.0. But we can reasonably expect the update to launch ahead of Phantom Liberty, which will arrive on September 26.\n\nThe post Cyberpunk 2077 dev warns players to check their PCs’ cooling ahead of 2.0 update appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "There aren't many video game developers who are as popular as Hideo Kojima. He left an indelible mark on the gaming world through the Metal Gear franchise, then managed to reboot his career following his departure from Konami. A new studio, Kojima Productions, was formed, and its first game, Death Stranding, was released in 2019. The studio's mascot is Ludens, and he wears a spacesuit, making him look ready for any adventure. \n\n\n\n\nRecently, a fan took inspiration from Ludens and created a handmade ring for Kojima. The ring, which Kojima showed off on Twitter, features the Ludens helmet, and the words \"60th anniversary\" are engraved, likely a reference to Kojima turning 60 this year. The eccentric game creator expressed great gratitude for the beautiful ring. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid.\n\n\nThe significance of Kojima Productions' Ludens mascot\n\n\nLudens is the Latin word for play, and it beautifully captures Kojima's driving philosophy. The mascot's name is a reference to the 1938 text by Johan Huizinga titled Homo Ludens. The text theorizes that it would be more accurate to characterize humans as a species of play, as play and imagination form integral parts of human societies and culture. \n\n\nThe concept weaves its way into Death Stranding, as seen with the Ludens sunglasses players receive early on. It features the following relevant description: \"Sunglasses designed with 'Homo ludens' in mind, their form encourages the wearer to never forget their playful side\". \n\n\n\n\nDespite turning 60, Kojima has certainly not forgotten his playful side, as he recently posted a picture of himself holding a Concorde Lego set. He's also shown his love for Starfield, suggesting he's been quite star-bound lately. \n\nThe post Hideo Kojima receives gorgeous handmade Ludens ring from fan appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, the next Demon Slayer title trades the arena battles for dice blocks and minigames.\nAnnounced as Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - Mezase! Saikyou Taishi!, via Gematsu, players will battle one another in the classic Mario Party formula with a twist. \nAs shown in the trailer provided by Aniplex, up to four players will roll the dice, walk spaces around the board, and compete in minigames to win currency to use against one another. Some of the games shown include a cup-and-ball-type game, and one where the players must slash targets as they rise from the ground. Much like Mario Party, some spaces will activate events where you may get an item to turn the tides of the game.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTE19wee424\nKamado Party\nAfter some time, the game will transition from day to night, where players will be able to take on the many demons roaming around the board. Once you encounter them, all four players will have to work together to defeat it. The Demon Slayer party game also boasts a roster of characters from all throughout the series, allowing you to choose from a handful of your favorite characters.\nThough Aniplex hasn't announced who's going to be developing the game, Aniplex itself is producing the title. Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - Mezase! Saikyou Taishi! is currently slated for a 2024 release on the Nintendo Switch for Japan, with no mention of other consoles.\nThe post The next Demon Slayer game is a board game-style Switch party appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "In a post on the official XDefiant website from Executive Game Director Mark Rubin, it was confirmed that the release of XDefiant is currently delayed. The popular FPS apparently received a Not Pass flag in the submission process for certification. The actual process started at the end of July, with the Not Pass result coming in mid-August. According to Rubin, most of the issues seemed to be related to compliance issues.\n\"We are currently in the CM prep part of that process and will hopefully be submitting to 1st parties in a little less than 2 weeks,\" Rubin stated in the post. \"If that Passes cleanly, then we could be looking at a mid-to-end of September release. There is however a likely scenario where we get a conditional Pass meaning we have to do a Day 1 patch with some final fixes to ensure compliance. If we do need to do a Day 1 patch, then that pushes our date out to early/mid-October.\"\n\nTypically speaking compliance issues are related to specific issues with first-party platforms. For example, trophies not unlocking properly on PS5, or friends lists not updating correctly. While these are certainly important issues, it's not as big of a deal as game-breaking bugs or crashes. Release delays are never fun, but in a case like this, it's definitely important to have some extra love going towards compliance issues.

Notably, he said that Starfield was optimized and that some PC gamers might simply need to upgrade their rigs for it to run properly.

          "description": "One of the biggest draws about Starfield is the number of planets you can explore. It's not so much an open-world game as it is more of an open-galaxy title. With that, you might understandably want these giant balls of rock to look their best. That's where the modding community comes into its own.\nYou see, while Starfield's planets do look pretty good, especially from low orbit, they evidently could stand to look prettier. That's why Nexus Mods user Revan (as spotted by DSO Gaming) has brought us their texture pack for a visual boost to some of the game's planets.\n[caption id=\"attachment_403598\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\"] Image via Revan/Nexus Mods.[/caption]\nUpscaling the vanilla look to 8K, this mod aims to give a more \"realistic\" look to these potential homesteads. At the moment, textures focus on the Sol System, which includes Earth, Earth's moon, Mars, Venus, and Jupiter. Revan is also upscaling the other \"biomemasks\" planets, with 90 of 555 done so far. The mod will be updated with more textures as they go along.\nConsole mod support inbound\nAlready, Starfield modders have been keeping themselves busy, and there are plenty being released all the time. In a more official capacity, Todd Howard recently confirmed the game would be getting Creation Kit mod support in 2024. This means that custom content for the Xbox Series X|S version of the game will be on the horizon.\nGoing down as the biggest launch in Bethesda's history, Starfield is a product several years in the making. From Howard's initial pitch back in 2013 to the release of the finished product just recently, it seems as though the hype has been worth it for the most part.\nThe post Upscale Starfield’s planets with this 8K texture pack appeared first on Destructoid.",

Part of the reason it's still going strong after 12 years is due to the modding community. The Elder Scrolls 5 has so many mods, including this recent one for all you Garret-from-Thief wannabees.\nOver on Nexus Mods, user Elsawirr has uploaded \"Immersive Carcass Carrying.\" As you can guess from the name, this is a way of allowing you to carry those dead bodies that you \"find\" in Tamriel. This is actually based on a previous mod they made that did the same thing. However, it's now been improved upon with new animations and the removal of the \"carry weight penalty.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dp0_tAK0yc\nA quick video shows it in action, with the Dragonborn seen carrying a dead moose over their shoulder. Indeed, it does look more immersive as they stroll through Whiterun and wait patiently in line at one of the food stalls. Very RDR2.\nSkyrim: a different beast these days\nIn this modern gaming era, it's not uncommon for people to poo-poo the vanilla version of TES5. With so many custom mods to download – especially on PC – many players prefer to tinker with Bethesda's epic RPG. While some are just there to tweak the gameplay, others (such as this one) improve the overall immersion. Then there are those that are just kind of out there and wild. You know the ones.\nAt any rate, Skyrim is still kicking it more than a decade after its release. Other games can only dream of being in the limelight for this length of time. Now, we just need to see whether Starfield can boast as big a legacy.\nThe post This Skyrim mod allows for ‘immersive’ corpse carrying appeared first on Destructoid.",

According to a new in-game notification straight from Nintendo (via OatmealDome), new content for Mario Kart Tour will cease to come out from October 4, 2023 onward.\nHere's the full wording from Nintendo:\n\"From 10/04/2023 (Wed) on, tours will consist of content from tours that have appeared before. Note: No new courses, drivers, karts, or gliders will be added following the Battle Tour starting 10/04/2023 (Wed). We hope you continue to enjoy playing Mario Kart Tour.\"\n\nWell, that's pretty definitive! I love how Nintendo clarified \"courses, drivers, karts, or gliders\" just to let folks know that there is no hope of new content coming to the game post-October. This is just a few weeks following the fourth anniversary of the game's release on September 25, 2019.\nMario Kart 8 Deluxe will carry on the legacy of Mario Kart Tour's few bright spots\nFunnily enough, a good chunk of the game's courses have already been ported over to Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, so even when the microtransaction-filled game goes offline entirely, its legacy will still live on in some form.

The game has faced numerous delays due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine which forced the team to quickly relocate from Kyiv to Prague.\nThis was far from the end of their problems, as they would also suffer cyber attacks originating from Russia. Because of all these hurdles, the game's release date has shifted to 2024. It appears that a new kind of problem has appeared, this time in the form of fire.\nIt was originally reported by the Czech publication Vortex on September 8 that GSC Game World had suffered a fire in their offices. According to PC Gamer, nobody was hurt in the fire, and a GSC representative has confirmed that the incident is under investigation.\n[caption id=\"attachment_403508\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via GSC Game World.[/caption]\nBattered but not beaten\nIn its official Discord server, the studio confirmed a few more details about the fire, including that although the fire was quickly put out, an office floor will need full restoration. Despite the setback, developers remain intent on releasing S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2, and their confidence is motivated by the fact that they've \"dealt with worse than that before.\"\nIt's certainly a true statement, as despite escaping a warzone, developers have been able to present a playable demo at this year's Gamescom. Although GSC Game World has attempted to defend the demo's \"imperfect\" state, the reception to it has been relatively good.\nThe post S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 devs face a new challenge – fire appeared first on Destructoid.",

Some players have grown quite attached to their ships, and it's not a surprise, as the game gives you the freedom to customize them as you please. If you're sufficiently ambitious and have the imagination for it, some incredibly impressive ships can be made, including the Imperial Star Destroyer from Star Wars.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/16c8zix/the_empire_has_arrived_in_the_settled_systems/\nThe behemoth, created by Reddit user /u/Jackygold, was originally posted on the Starfield subreddit, and people loved it so much that /u/Jackygold eventually created a lengthy guide explaining how to make the spaceship.

From the combat's blistering pace to the depth of customization, this is undoubtedly one of the best mech games in a long time. It also has a solid narrative about fighting against the odds for your beliefs and survival.\nThe delivery is more direct than most works coming out of FromSoftware since its games often keep the surface narrative light. Armored Core has always been this way, even if the latest entry is more dialogue-focused than its predecessors.\nAlso like what came before, Armored Core 6's ending come from branching paths depending on missions chosen at key points.

That's for good reason, too, as Starfield is currently missing a crucial feature that all Bethesda Game Studios RPGS eventually receive: Creation Kit support. Until Creation Kit 2 - built specifically for Starfield's Creation Engine 2 - comes out, modders won't be able to easily add new weapons, customizations, and other assorted goodies into the game, but the good news is that it's bound to happen relatively soon!\nNotably, in a recent interview with Famitsu, Bethesda's Todd Howard said that official …",

I feel as if — in many, but maybe not all cases — the Venn diagram of anime fans to gamers is a perfect circle.\nThere are also a metric ton of games based on anime — My Hero One’s Justice, One Piece Odyssey, and Dragon Ball FighterZ, to name three. On the flip side, there are even more anime based on games — the recently released Nier Automata adaptation, Persona 5: The Animation, and Doll’s/Girl’s Frontline.\nIt’s a fool’s errand to say the two media are not connected.

Aptly, this new controller is titled \"Astral Purple.\" It looks great and is available for preorder now before its September 19 release date. \nXbox says, \"This rich purple color has a distinct regal look to spice up your gaming setup and bolster your collection,\" noting that the dark purple theme carries over to both thumbsticks, all four face buttons, and the three menu buttons in the center of the controller. The triggers, bumpers, and d-pad feature a matte black finish, and the back case is a bright white. \nLike most other Xbox Series X/S controllers, the Astral Purple edition will cost $64.99. It's available for preorder and releases on September 19. As expected, it features all the usual bells, whistles, and features of the standard Xbox Series X/S controller, so if you’re looking to add a little more purple to your collection, this might be for you. \nWhile waiting for its release, check out the Stormcloud Vapor controller revealed last month and then read about the Xbox Elite Series 2 \"Core\" Edition controller.

Premium and Kollector Editions of the game go live this Thursday, September 14, and the regular edition goes live next week on September 19. Ahead of the game's release, NetherRealm has released the official launch trailer, featuring four minutes of new gameplay, fatalities, gore, and more. \nToday's trailer also features our first look at gameplay for Shang Tsung, whom you get if you preorder the game, more of the story, which centers on a rebooted Mortal Kombat universe by way of Fire God Liu Kang, and Reiko, General Shao's second-in-command. Check it out for yourself below:\n\n\nShang Tsung is still a sorcerer and his moveset in the trailer reflects that, with fiery projectiles, massive combos, and the ability to morph into other fighters. Reiko, on the other hand, is described by NetherRealm as \"a savage warrior with a fighting style that matches his fierce persona.\" Elsewhere in the trailer, we get new looks at many of the roster's other fighters, like the Jean-Claude Van Damme skin for Johnny Cage and the recently revealed Nitara, who Megan Fox voices. \nMortal Kombat 1 hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC on September 14 for Premium and Kollector editions of the game. The rest of the editions go live on September 19. \nWhile waiting for the game's release, watch Ed Boon talk about Mortal Kombat 1 on hot wing-eating interview show Hot Ones, and then watch this Nitara gameplay trailer.

          "description": "Stray proved to be an unlikely phenomenon when it was released last July, and now the little kitty and its robotic pals are heading to the big screen. Publisher Annapurna has announced plans to develop an animated movie based on the hit indie game.\nPer Entertainment Weekly, Annapurna Animation, the company's new animated film division, is following up its debut feature, Nimona, with a film adaptation of the 2022 adventure game. It will be the first game in Annapurna Interactive’s roster of titles to get the cinematic treatment, and, according to the publisher, it won’t be the last. Annapurna has not revealed a director, cast, or release window for the Stray film. Annapurna Animation is led by former Disney Animation executives Robert Baird and Andrew Millstein. \n\"This is a game that's all about what makes us human, and there are no humans in it,\" Baird tells EW. \"It's a buddy comedy about a cat and a robot, and there's such a hilarious dynamic. So, there's comedy inherent in this, but there's not one human being in this movie. I think it's one of the reasons why the game was incredibly popular, that you are seeing the world through the point of view of an adorable cat. How did they pull that off, and how are we going to pull that off in the movie? We will, even though sometimes it feels impossible, but we know that's the essence of the game and the key to telling the story.\"\nStray was developed by French studio BlueTwelve. Taking place in a post-apocalyptic Earth devoid of humans, players control a cat who gets separated from its friends and sets out to find them. The cat's journey takes it through cities occupied by sentient robots, which it befriends along the way, namely a flying drone named B-12. Stray was among the most celebrated games of last year, winning Best Debut Indie at the Game Awards, and made its way to Xbox last month. You can read our review of Stray here. \n[Source: Entertainment Weekly]",

The presentation takes place on September 21 at 2 a.m. PT/5 a.m. ET.\nAccording to Xbox Wire, the event will feature “progress updates from Xbox and Bethesda Softworks and see a creatively diverse collection of games from creators predominantly located in Japan and across Asia.” The event will also reveal new titles for Xbox Game Pass.\nThe most likely game to appear is Final Fantasy XIV, which is heading to Xbox next spring ahead of its upcoming Dawntrail expansion. Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, which last popped up during this summer's Xbox Games Showcase, could also reappear. Of course, there are plenty of big Japanse developed titles incoming that could get a spotlight, and it's always interesting to see what Asian companies and titles it courts each year. \nTokyo Game Show runs from September 21 to 24.

However, E3's overseer the ESA has announced this partnership will not continue.\nAccording to GameIndustry.biz, the ESA and ReedPop have come to a mutual decision to part ways. On top of that, E3 2024, which is still planned to take place, will not be held at its traditional venue, the Los Angeles Convention Center. This had been previously reported by the city itself. There’s no word on where E3 will be held, but the site reports that the ESA is also looking to completely reinvent the show in 2025. \n“We appreciate ReedPop’s partnership over the past 14 months and support their ongoing efforts to bring industry and fans together through their various events,” said ESA president and CEO Stanley Pierre-Louis in a statement to GameIndustry.biz. “While the reach of E3 remains unmatched in our industry, we are continuing to explore how we can evolve it to best serve the video game industry and are evaluating every aspect of the event, from format to location. We are committed to our role as a convenor for the industry and look forward to sharing news about E3 in the coming months.”\nReedPop had been tasked with revamping this year’s ill-fated E3 after the show had collapsed over the last few years due to the pandemic and waning interest from publishers/developers. The 2023 edition fell through after Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft declined to attend alongside publishers such as Ubisoft and Sega. The last in-person E3 was in 2019, and outside of the online-only 2021 event, every subsequent E3 has been completely canceled. Geoff Keighley's Summer Game Fest has filled the void since then. \n[Source: GameIndustry.biz]",

          "description": "Mortal Kombat 1’s roster already has a few returning names from the series’ 3D era in the forms of Ashrah and Havik, and another long-lost favorite joins the fight. Nitara is making her long-awaited return, and it’s such a big homecoming that NetherRealm has enlisted actress Megan Fox to voice her.\nNitara is a vampire that made her debut in 2002’s Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance. She’s only been playable in a couple of entries, had a small cameo in Mortal Kombat 11, and appeared in the 2021 Mortal Kombat film. Despite having only a few appearances to her name, she’s endured as favorite among fans who grew up with the 2000s era, and she looks as deadly as ever in MK 1. \nMegan Fox brings Nitara to life, and you can get a sample of her performance in the trailer below. “I grew up playing Mortal Kombat and I can’t believe that I’m voicing a character in the new game,\" Fox says in a press release. \"It’s an honor to be a part of one of the greatest video game legacies of all time.” Given that Ronda Rousey voiced Sonya Blade in MK 11, it’s not surprising to see NetherRealm rope in another celebrity to perform one of its kombatants. \n\n\nMortal Kombat 1 launches on September 19 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. Check out our latest hands-on impressions of its Invasions and Story Mode here. Be sure to also watch the game's most recent trailer from Gamescom 2023.",

But the latter was the highlight of my experience. \nI completed three contracts during my hands-on time, each at different levels of progression for protagonist Basim Ibn Is’haq.

As fans know, the best way to follow up a good TMNT project is to make a video game out of it, and that’s exactly what's happening next year. \nPublisher Outright Games, along with Paramount and Nickelodeon, have announced a new untitled TMNT game in development set within the Mutant Mayhem universe. It will feature the same striking visual design and follows a new story set months after the movie's events. There’s no word yet on if the film’s ensemble cast will reprise their roles.\nIn terms of gameplay, a press release only hints that the project involves “combining energetic ninja teamwork gameplay with a humorous narrative, players will take control of the Turtles as they interact with a host of memorable characters from the franchise and fight to save this stylized take on New York City from a new mutant threat.” Outright Games has experience working on games based on kid-friendly licenses, making titles based on Star Trek: Prodigy, How to Train Your Dragon, Paw Patrol, and Peppa Pig. \nThe TMNT: Mutant Mayhem game is targeting PC and consoles. It’s the latest project in what’s been quite a renaissance for the Turtles, especially in video games. The resurgence kicked off with last year’s well-received TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge, which recently got a big new expansion. The Cowabunga Collection bundled nearly every classic TMNT game into one package for a modern audience. A single-player action game based on the beloved TMNT: The Last Ronin graphic novel is also in the works.",

Play as Agent 007 on his most challenging missions yet – escape the Mind Trap, defeat Blofeld, and put an end to the Cypher program.\" \nBecause it's a 007 game, you'll run into other MI6 operatives like Q, M, and Moneypenny, all while completing levels that increase in difficulty as you progress.

Instead of inviting players back to Derceto on October 25, the survival horror adventure will now arrive on January 16.\nIn a press release, developer Pieces Interactive offers a candid explanation for the move: it doesn’t want the game to compete with October’s heavy hitters like Marvel's Spider-Man 2 and another big horror game, Alan Wake 2. \n“Our intention is to avoid competing with the wake of Alan's epic release and to evade the dazzling skyline of cities adorned by the graceful swings of Spider-Man,\" Pieces writes. \"We aim to truly remain as Alone in the Dark as possible. To honor this, the spine-chilling horror game has been rescheduled to unveil its horrors on January 16th, 2024. This extension will serve a dual purpose: not only will it permit us to meticulously perfect the gaming experience, but it will also grant us the opportunity to fully immerse ourselves in the remarkable releases of October.”\nThe studio also released a new trailer starring David Harbour’s Edward Carnby, one of the game’s protagonists, showing off his performance and impressive facial capture. \n\n\nAlone in the Dark is a modernized revamp of the 1992 survival horror classic that stars actors Jodie Comer and David Harbour as protagonists Emily Hartwood and detective Edward Carnby, respectively. Players control one character to explore the haunted Derceto hospital to solve a sinister mystery, with both scenarios offering different story threads and moments.

I’d spent the first few minutes referring to it as a sequel, but he clarifies, \"It’s not Hyper Light Drifter 2. It’s a follow-up, meaning that it’s an installment in the franchise of Hyper Light. So it’s a different game, different protagonists, different gameplay.\" After getting the chance to learn more about the game and see it in action, this distinction makes a lot of sense. For me to call it a sequel was misleading, given how different the games look and play.\nBreaker is a 3D rogue-lite with a strong emphasis on multiplayer. Players explore an area called the Overgrowth, collect weapons and gear, and fight off monsters. And though the…",

It also highlights that parts of the game are playable as an isometric, third-person shooter like last year’s Signalis and as an over-the-shoulder third-person shooter like in Capcom’s recent Resident Evil remakes. \nCheck out the Holstin gameplay reveal trailer for yourself below: \n\n\n“A psychological survival horror game set in an eerie, isolated 90’s Polish town consumed by an ominous presence,” the Holstin Steam page reads. “You’ve come looking for answers, but everyone seems possessed by something foul. Explore the festering town, interrogate locals, and fight ungodly manifestations to get to the truth.” \nThere’s no release date in sight for Holstin, but you can try the game for yourself today through a demo available on Steam right now. \nHolstin is set to release one day on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.\nFor more scary games, read Game Informer’s list of the top 10 horror games to play right now, and then read our list of the top 25 horror games of all time after that.",

Since Lars Sundström, aka lman, joined our team as the iOS porter, we have made significant progress. Thus, you no longer need to compile ScummVM yourself in order to add it to your iOS or iPadOS device. \nIf you want to help by testing this version, just follow this Testflight link and enroll yourself in the test program. This may require installing Apple’s Testflight app. You can find instructions on how to install games and how to play them on our documentation portal.\nWe truly appreciate your feedback. You can share your thoughts with the Testflight feedback feature, where you can attach screenshots and post detailed descriptions. Alternatively, you can use our bugtracker, e-mail us at ios@scummvm.org, or post on our Discord Server. Your help will let us eventually add ScummVM to the App Store.\n>",
