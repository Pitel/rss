These are the people who play through the games as they are being developed, pointing out any moment in which it goes wrong and crashes or lets the player do something that they shouldn't normally be able to. In years gone by, the debuggers had to record their gameplay sessions on tapes to catch any mistakes, before turning them into the development team who would then analyse and recode.\nSome of these very tapes have now been acquired by the YouTube channel Hard4Games, who has tidied up the footage and put together a video on the findings therein.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Of course, it’s not always a guarantee, especially with a formula that has been followed consistently for the last 26 years, but we always start a new generation with our fingers crossed that we'll be charmed out of the gate by the new creatures to collect and a whole new region to explore. And if anything has come close to recapturing the real magic we felt when we discovered our first Pokémon world in Red & Blue, it’s Pokémon Scarlet & Violet's vast and open Paldea region. It’s been a while since we’ve felt like a kid stepping out of our Pokémon house and just looking at the world and savouring the taste of adventure. Despite some pretty significant technical stumbles, this introduction to Generation 9 nails that, even if it’s not the new Pokémon revolution that Legends: Arceus felt like.\nScarlet & Violet’s promise of being the main series’ first open-world game isn’t a false one. Every inch of Paldea is ours for the taking, and we’re ready for adventure just like the little kids who booted up their Game Boys for the first time and took their first steps in Kanto. Adventure awaits, and it’s right on our doorstep. Except things don’t start that way.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Niantic ended up cancelling this special surprise at the last minute, but not before those in the GMT +13 time zone in Australia and New Zealand saw it, which meant that the surprise was spoiled.\nThe surprise was supposed to be an encounter with the Pokémon Zorua, but a bug meant that Zorua would take its moveset, CP, and height from your Buddy Pokémon, allowing some trainers to catch a very beefy Zorua indeed. In response, Niantic removed the ability to actually use or trade the Pokémon, and cancelled the surprise for everyone else, although the Shuppet Spotlight Hour event still went on as otherwise planned.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Now that we're heading into the ninth generation of the franchise with Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, however, there are near-enough 1000 of the beggars to keep track of, so it got us thinking: Do players still go to the effort of nicknaming them all?\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

That’s not inaccurate, but there’s a lot more going on in Max Inferno’s first game. Presenting you with one-screen scenes of real-life objects like books, batteries, and cleaning products, the game invites you to get organising. The simplest asks are to just make a drawer neat, or straighten some pictures, but it soon becomes more sophisticated, launching into magical realist daydreams of how shadows and stars might be arranged to satisfy some sort of imagined rule set.\nAnd it’s the imaginary nature of the rules that surprises most. Re-assembling a torn picture has a clear and obvious objective, for instance, but what is the right way to line up some pencils? Shortest to longest? Yellowest to purplest? Pointiest to bluntest? There’s no one right answer, so the game will usually accept whatever is your personal intuition – then shock you with the fact that there were other ways of seeing what seemed certain.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

We are amidst the busiest few weeks in PC gaming hardware for at least four years, with major product launches all round (from its rival Radeon RX 7900 XT to Intel’s 13th Gen CPUs) and a neverending stream of other components and peripherals that still need appraising. Also, I get the impression that if I don’t do more Black Friday stuff, senior ReedPop figures will show up at my flat and start taking my fingers with chisels.\r\n\n\r\nStill, there will no doubt be potential graphics card upgrade-makers looking at the RTX 4080 to see if it’s more of a palatable purchase than the RTX 4090. That vanguard of Nvidia’s next-gen Ada Lovelace architecture is by far the most powerful GPU I’ve ever tested, and introduced a very cool new feature in DLSS 3, but with prices starting £1679 / $1599 it’s just not a sensible option. And since I did have an RTX 4080 show up at the last minute – Asus’ customised ROG Strix GeForce RTX 4080 OC Edition – I can at least provide some quick benchmarks and initial thoughts as to whether it’s a better deal.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Drinking too much wine and playing the piano badly and getting chased out of a hotel lobby is easy — most of us could do it — but it takes a degree of talent to sound entertainingly rubbish.\nLikewise, Goat Simulator 3 is an expertly janky game about being a silly little goat and running around causing mischief. It’s a dumb, open-world simulator in which bugs have been promoted to features. Your goat is a horrible little kooky guy who mostly interacts with the environment through the medium of headbutts and licking. They’ll occasionally be catapulted into the sky by a spasmodic police car, or have their head irreversibly enlarged by a special machine, or bleat so hard at a beanstalk that it vanishes into thin air, but even during the most chaotic moments things feel entirely under control. As though the invisible hand of a very, very tired QA tester is always on the tiller.\nRead more",

There’s also a new Big Head Mode for the game’s recently added Silly Queue, and an in-game store that brings all MultiVersus’ skins and characters into one place for the first time. Weirdly, but appropriately, the game now keeps score of baskets on the Space Jam map and tracks how far away you shoot from too, so have some fun netting three-pointers with that.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Just when I thought I had my top 10 games of 2022 sorted, Obsidian release Pentiment, forcing me to shred my former list and grab my quill and ink for a rewrite. It’s an odd pairing on paper - a detective thriller about a string of grisly murders set in the quaint countryside of 16th-century Bavaria - but, surprisingly, this coupling is a match made in heaven. \nIts captivating story of conspiracy and murder is as rich and dense as its setting, and it's clearly made by a passionate team who have a deep love for the period. Playing Pentiment feels like riffling through the painterly pages of a medieval manuscript, but instead of finding the written gospel of saints and sinners, there are tales of angry farmers, greedy landowners, church scandals, religious turmoil, and murder. Fundamentally though, it's a historical tale about faith and truth, and the lengths that people are willing to go to preserve them.\nRead more",

At EyeLife's Flat Eye stations, why stop at getting milk and snacks when you can also pick up a whole new stomach, liver and other assorted organs? You'll find them on aisle five, right next to the surgery booths. Perhaps you'd prefer a quick medical checkup instead, though? After all, your tailored biometric predictions for the day looked a bit dodgy earlier, and goodness knows you're not going to wait to see an actual doctor about it.\nAfterwards, why not escape for a bit and treat yourself to an immersive VR experience? They've got everything from hour-long fantasies to ones that last days, or even weeks. Your choice. And if you're short on time, you could always just give yourself those happy memories by sitting in their mind-altering MemoryMachines for a couple of minutes. Just don't forget to steer clear of the big recycle chambers. I heard something terrible happened to a dog who wandered into one recently, and the owner went absolutely ballistic. And watch out for the GentleSleep pods, too. I've only ever seen the clerk take long black sacks out of there and stick them in the incinerator, and the smell was awful. \nRead more",

Or will be, once the RTX 4080 goes on sale on November 16th.

Billed as a life sim RPG, and with a title that evokes farming, you could be forgiven for expecting something along the lines of Harvest Moon or Stardew Valley, but with more monster biffing. Instead, Harvestella sits firmly in the epic quest camp, with your adventuring being supported by your rural activities.\nAnyone looking to build a pastoral paradise is going to be sorely disappointed, as the farming elements are somewhat rudimentary. Even calling your property a farm is a bit of a stretch. Even after a few upgrades, my plot is more of a large garden, maybe an allotment, if I’m being generous.\nRead more",

But, for lack of a nicer way to put it, I’ll simply say things are looking pretty scary out there, huh? Capitalism is failing, the economy is crumbling, and normal people have nothing left to give. It’s something I've been thinking about a lot lately, but I don’t really talk about it. I keep it all inside, like a microwave holding a ball of tin foil while it spins on full power.\nAt least, that was the case until I played Citizen Sleeper. It’s a rather simple RPG inspired by tabletop roleplaying games, giving you a limited number of action dice that you can spend each day to receive consequences. Mechanically, it doesn’t stretch much further than those actions and consequences, meaning I can instead focus on connecting with characters. In its simplicity, I found a cathartic way to process my thoughts on lots of scary stuff happening in our actual world. I also realised that Starfield, the big space game looming on the horizon which I was previously pretty excited about, just doesn’t seem appealing anymore.\nRead more",

          "description": "Say what you will about Square Enix's ill-fated ventures into NFTs and mildly embarrassing follies with live service games recently. Their commitment to remaking, remastering and generally sprucing up their ageing back catalogue from decades past is an admirable one in my eyes, even if they are making you pay through the nose for them almost every single time. As we all know, though, some have made more successful transitions than others. The dream, of course, at least for me, is the Final Fantasy VII Remake approach for literally everything, no matter how unfeasible, impractical or physically impossible that would be for Squeenix's enormous game library. Alas, the reality is often a lot more modest. Best case scenario: you're a 90s SNES game getting a lovely HD-2D makeover like Live A Live. Next on the rung: some added 3D zhuzh a la Final Fantasy VIII Remastered (although even that was by no means perfect). \nMostly, though, it's your Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster treatment. A welcome update that maintains the look of the originals (albeit with some questionable font choices), but that's more or less your lot. Tactics Ogre: Reborn, a remaster of the 2010 PSP remake of the 1995 SNES original, falls squarely into the latter camp, but you know what? That's fine. It's still a rollicking turn-based tactics game all these years later, and one that definitely deserves to be freed from the shackles of Sony's long-dead handheld, where it's lain dormant for the better part of a decade. Besides, I'll take a fully re-orchestrated soundtrack over slightly fancier pixels any day of the week. You know me. \nRead more",

This means that both the EU and UK are now holding further investigations into the potential buyout of Activision Blizzard due to concerns that Microsoft’s acquisition of the company could reduce competition within the games industry.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Last week for the AMD EPYC 4th Gen \"Genoa\" launch day I published initial AMD EPYC 9554 and EPYC 9654 Linux benchmarks as part of my review. Those 64-core and 96-core Zen 4 processors performed phenomenally with Genoa having AVX-512, twelve channels of DDR5-4800 system memory support, higher TDP allowance, and other improvements over prior Milan(X) server processors. The other SKU that AMD sent over for review is the EPYC 9374F as their new 32-core high frequency part. For less than $5k, the EPYC 9374F is a high frequency Zen 4 32-core part with a 320 Watt TDP. Today's benchmarks are looking at the EPYC 9374F against the EPYC 9554/9654 and various other AMD EPYC and Intel Xeon Scalable processors under Linux.",

          "description": "NetEase license ends January 2023\nBlizzard Entertainment has announced that it is preparing to suspend service for all of its gaming properties in China in 2023.\nOn January 23, Blizzard's agreement with Chinese holding company NetEase, which handles regional publishing duties, will expire. The two companies have been unable to negotiate new terms for a contract extension, and thus Blizzard will be taking the severe step of suspending service for all of its online titles — including World of Warcraft, Warcraft III: Reforged, Hearthstone, Diablo III, Diablo: Immortal, StarCraft, Overwatch, and Heroes of the Storm.\nAccording to an official statement by the publisher, the Chinese release of Overwatch 2, World of Warcraft: Dragonflight, and Hearthstone: March of the Lich King \"will proceed later this year\". Blizzard Entertainment will continue to see a new publishing partner in the highly lucrative market.\n\nNetEase has handled Blizzard Entertainment's output in China since way back in 2008, so this decision is quite surprising. Additional reporting by Bloomberg suggests that the failed contract negotiations were not just a matter of money, but also disputes on how to handle player data and general IP management. No doubt the news will also come as a major shock to the many Chinese esports players/teams that have built their brand around Blizzard games.\n\"We’re immensely grateful for the passion our Chinese community has shown throughout the nearly 20 years we’ve been bringing our games to China through NetEase and other partners,\" said Blizzard President Mike Ybarra. \"Their enthusiasm and creativity inspire us, and we are looking for alternatives to bring our games back to players in the future.\"\nYou can read Blizzard's official statement on the matter on the studio's website.\nThe post Blizzard Entertainment to suspend game services in China appeared first on Destructoid.",

For those of you who’ve been waiting for years, thank you for hanging in there with us.\"\n\"In the meantime, we will be releasing an exciting new trailer and gameplay at The Dead Island 2 Showcase, which will premiere on December 6 on our Twitch and YouTube channels, as well as on the Dead Island website.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dv1cqr1npA\nWhilst you undoubtedly do not need a refresher course, Dead Island 2 has had a long and arduous road to fruition, having first been teased way back at E3 2014. Over the following years, myriad reports of cancellation and delays — with no less than three studios working on the title, led many to believe that the open-world sequel was becoming something of an urban myth. However, a release date was finally announced in August of this year... A release date which has now been pushed just a little further backward.\nThe best things come to those who wait?

You've got the classics in there like Team Deathmatch and Kill Confirmed, but there are also some new modes to try out like Headquarters and Prison Rescue.\nWhile I've certainly had a ton of fun throwing myself into some games to try out modes I don't usually play, I am very much a creature of habit -- Domination is by far my favorite mode, and a lot of the time I'll load into the game wi…",

In a new interview, Santa Monica Studios' Cory Barlog says the studio is currently spread out across a lot of different things.\nSpeaking to the Los Angeles Times, Barlog says Sony Santa Monica Studio is currently \"spread out on a lot of different things.\" The director declines to specify what those are. But as the LA Times points out, there were rumors of a sci-fi project at the studio that was cancelled. Sony Santa Monica has also helped publish games in the past, like Journey.\nSanta Monica Studio just launched God of War Ragnarok. the follow-up to the 2018 God of War reboot. And as Ragnarok director Eric Williams puts it, being the God of War studio isn't a bad thing.\n“I remember talking to someone from another game company, where they were trying to get me to leave,\" Williams told the LA Times. \"They said, 'Do you just want to be known as the God of War guy for the rest of your life?'

          "description": "Cyberpunk's first DLC is right around the corner\nFans of CD Projekt Red's most recent release, Cyberpunk 2077, have been waiting quite some time now to learn some more information about the game's first official DLC: Phantom Liberty. News of the spy thriller expansion was first released back in September via a teaser trailer, and we know it's scheduled to drop sometime in 2023 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S (Stadia is also listed as a platform for release in the official Cyberpunk website's blog post from a few months ago, but I have a feeling that one is subject to change).\nWhile news of a more specific release window is up in the air, we do have confirmation as of today that Phantom Liberty will be paid DLC expansion, but we don't know how much it'll be yet, either. Paying for DLC is something that CD Projekt fans know well (just look at The Witcher 3), and if I had to guess based on precedence, I'd say this new expansion should be somewhere around $20 depending on how big it is. In a comment to GamesRadar+, the global PR director for CDPR, Radek Grabowski, said that the expansions are \"traditionally cheaper than full-price games,\" so at the very least we know it won't be $60. We'll take what we can get at this point.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbVKBoDuhZ0\nThis likely won't be the only DLC we see for Cyberpunk, either, but if you ask me a spy thriller theme is a great place to start. I imagine the adventure will have something to do with corporate espionage, and if we're basing predictions on the past Witcher DLC, there's a good chance we could see new maps and characters, and even get a whole new synth-style soundtrack. I for one will be excited to see what comes next for Night City, especially after the renewed hype for the game from the Cyberpunk: Edgerunners anime.\nThe post Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty is confirmed as a paid DLC appeared first on Destructoid.",

Lionsgate has picked up the film adaptation of the beat 'em up Streets of Rage, with John Wick writer Derek Kolstad writing.\nThis news was reported on earlier this year by Deadline. Today's confirmation sees the Streets of Rage project finding a home at Lionsgate, with Kolstad producing alongside Toru Nakahara. Dj2 Entertainment's Dmitri M. Johnson, Timothy I. Stevenson, and Dan Jevons are also on board, as well as Escape Artists' Todd Black, Jason Blumenthal, and Tony Shaw.\nDj2 Entertainment is important to note, as the company worked on the recent Sonic the Hedgehog film series and is also looking to adapt It Takes Two.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDXY1WRef0Q\nStreets of Rage saw a bit of a revival, thanks to the 2020 release of Streets of Rage 4 that went over pretty well. It's a classic in the beat 'em up genre, and it's easy to see how someone behind the John Wick series would gravitate to a property like this.\n\"When Dmitri first mentioned the idea of cracking a Streets of Rage movie, I was so immediately freaking in,\" Kolstad said in a statement via Variety. “And to play with Sega? The 10-year-old me is still grinning.”\nA new adaptation\nThis adds another video game to the long list of upcoming video game adaptations. It's become a popular trend, as productions like Arcane and Sonic the Hedgehog have worked out pretty well. Even Cyberpunk: Edgerunners and The Witcher, based off media properties that existed before their game counterparts, saw boosts thanks to their series' successes.\nFor Streets of Rage? I'm just hoping for some brawling action with the series' best. I could easily see a found-family story about a rag-tag crew of fighters working here. And it's a good excuse to play some more Streets of Rage, too.\nThe post Lionsgate picks up Streets of Rage movie, with John Wick writer on board appeared first on Destructoid.",

The publisher essentially left the platform in 2019, choosing to release all of its PC out via its in-house Uplay service and later on Epic Games Store.\nThe first sign that Ubisoft might be heading back to chez Valve came earlier in November, when a Steam port of Assassin's Creed Valhalla was found lurking in the Ubisoft Connect database. The epic Norse adventure, which first launched back in 2020, will be receiving its final update next month, and thus is a prime candidate for a \"complete edition\" debut on Steam in time for the holidays.\nBut Ubisoft's comeback plans were practically confirmed yesterday, when then colorful wheelie racer Roller Champions made a brief appearance on the Steamdb. Initially spotted by known Ubisoft leaker YoobieRE, the free-to-play title swiftly had its status hidden shortly thereafter. But, given the clarity of these two leaks, it seems highly likely that we can expect an official announcement from Ubisoft soon. As a somewhat-struggling multiplayer-centric title, a new Steam port could only serve to widen the Roller Champions audience and benefit the game as a whole.\nUbisoft is currently working on Assassin's Creed Mirage, which will launch for PC and consoles in 2023.\nThe post Further evidence that Ubisoft is returning to Steam appeared first on Destructoid.",

Splat speed ahead!\" Both can be viewed in the tweets below.\nWhile we knew another season was upon us, the high-energy Pokemon Splatfest and this new season are a great shot in the arm for Splatoon 3. While the game had a lot going for it at launch, a lot of folks were a bit tired of it a month in. For me, Big Run could be the crown jewel of the update/Chill Season: which allows players to swap the standard Salmon Run map for a rotating selection of core multiplayer levels (beginning with Wahoo World).\nHopefully more of these types of updates are on the way. The frequency likely won't change, but at the very least, the team can supplement them with surgical quality of life changes and tweaks to build on the foundation that's already there.\nHere's a look at the Splattershot Nova\nhttps://twitter.com/SplatoonNA/status/1592564555397431305\nAnd here's Brinewater Springs, the new Splatoon 3 level\nhttps://twitter.com/SplatoonNA/status/1592564656177963008\nThe post Nintendo gives us a closer look at the new Splatoon 3 stage and weapon appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Shoot that poison arrow...\nCapcom has released the first significant DLC drop for its survival horror multiplayer title Resident Evil Re:Verse — Focusing on smash-seller Resident Evil Village, the first roster addition sees the coming of Hound Wolf specialist Tundra, as well as a creepy new map from the dilapidated town itself.\nEmily Berkhoff, better known by her call-sign \"Tundra\", is one of the mysterious officers serving within Chris Redfield's BSAA unit, Hound Wolf. Loyal to the cause, Berkoff administers her duty with cold, ruthless calculation. Berkoff rose through the ranks of the DEA to join the BSA as a drug and poison specialist — a skill which, as Tundra, she uses to deadly effect in the violent confrontations of Resident Evil Re:Verse.\n\nThe new map, simply titled \"Village\", focuses on the town square and its ominous Maiden of War centerpiece. The icy air and brutal, ragged stone environment will test the killing skills of even the most hardened mercenary... erm... Re:Verser. Offering wide-open areas of conflict, as well as plenty of waist-high cover, Village should offer tactical engagement options for all play styles.\n\nIn addition to the arrival of Tundra and Village, two classic character skins have also been made available for purchase. The skins reflect series veterans Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine as they appeared in 2009's Resident Evil 5, with Chris rocking his boulder-punching biceps, while Ms. Valentine dons her sleek, night-black bodysuit — sans gross, mind-controlling parasite. A new Premium Pass is also available for purchase, which includes tier reward skins for Leon Kennedy and the delectable Ada Wong.\nResident Evil Re:Verse is available now on PS4, PC, and Xbox One.\nThe post Resident Evil Re:Verse DLC includes Village character Tundra and new map appeared first on Destructoid.",

As a quick refresher, Essential offers monthly free titles and online capabilities, Extra throws in access to a catalog of rotating titles, while Premium users also receive access to the PlayStation Classics range, as well as exclusive demos and trials.\nWith a 25% discount included, PlayStation owners can expect the following prices in the rumored offer:\nPlayStation Plus Essential (12 Month) - $44.99 / €44.99 / £37.49\nPlayStation Plus Extra (12 Month) – $74.99 / €74.99 / £62.99\nPlayStation Plus Premium (12 Month) – $89.99 / €89.99 / £74.99\nAdmittedly, in financially tough times such as these, 80 buckeroos for a gaming subscription is still a pretty hefty ask. But if you're the type of player to burn through games with reckless abandon, then having access to a constantly rotating catalog of releases across 2023 will, ultimately, pay for itself.\nOf course, there is no official word the deal is definitely happening. But, given Dealabs consistent accuracy when revealing PlayStation Plus titles, this Black Friday discount rumor can probably be filed under \"concrete\".\nThe post Rumor: PlayStation Plus to receive 25% discount for Black Friday appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "I got the music in me\nA few months ago, the Recording Academy announced it was adding five new categories to its annual Grammy Awards, including a new category solely for soundtracks to video games and other interactive media. A video game grammy award has been a long time coming, given how the medium has produced some of the most outstanding musical scores of the past 20 years. Just yesterday, The Game Awards announced its top picks for Best Score with Xenoblade Chronicles 3, Metal Hellsinger, Elden Ring, God of War Ragnarock, and A Plague Tale: Requiem making the cut. None of those games are up for the inaugural video game soundtrack Grammy, but that probably has to do with release scheduling and other requirements that might not have been met.\nInstead, the five games nominated for Score Soundtrack for Video Games and Other Interactive Media are:\nAliens: Fireteam Elite (Composer: Austin Wintory)\nAssassin's Creed Valhalla: Dawn of Ragnarok (Composer: Stephanie Economou)\nCall of Duty: Vanguard (Composer: Bear McCreary)\nMarvel's Guardians of the Galaxy (Composer: Richard Jacques)\nOld World (Composer: Christopher Tin)\nYour guess is as good as mine as to what Old World is, but there are few recognizable names on that list. Bear McCreary is perhaps best known across the industry for his work scoring films like Godzilla: King of the Monsters, as well as video games like God of War and God of War Ragnarok. Austin Wintory is also a name you should know, given his work on titles like Journey and The Banner Saga trilogy.\nTo find out who takes home the inaugural video game Grammy, tune in to the Grammy pre-show on February 5, where this award is most likely to be handed out.\nThe post Assassin’s Creed, Call of Duty, and Aliens: Fireteam Elite among first video game Grammy nominees appeared first on Destructoid.",

Mei is the most recent hero to disappear from the roster, and now she's not expected to return for another couple of days. That's right -- the mid-season patch has officially been delayed.\nWhile the original announcement stated that the delay would be indefinite, an update as of today at 4:00 pm PST let us know that we only have to wait until the end of the week, because the new ETA for the patch is this Friday, November 17 at 11:00 am PST. Phew, don't scare us like that, Blizzard.\nhttps://twitter.com/BlizzardCS/status/1592594536215158786\nThe patch will include \"balance changes, bug fixes, including those that affect Mei,\" as well as \"core content updates.\" The delay will also impact \"the delivery of Overwatch League Viewership Incentives & Perks from the Postseason matches during the period between Oct 30 - Nov 4, along with the rotation of cosmetics in the Overwatch League shop.\" The daily and weekly challenges also reset today like normal, along with the \"standard shop refresh.\"\nThankfully things aren't as bleak as they originally appeared, because the game never feels the same when any of the heroes are missing. After Bastion was pulled a few weeks ago for balance changes as well, the internet was flooded with memes, including some hilariously edited missing persons (omnics?) posters. I'm a bit torn about Mei's disappearance myself -- on one hand, I kind of miss the chaos of having an unhinged Mei player on my team, but I definitely don't miss getting and frozen, walled off, and icicled to the head.

And now, NieR also joins the cameo ranks of Ubisoft's Rainbow Six Siege.\nUbisoft revealed today that a NieR cosmetic bundle is making its way into Rainbow Six Siege, arriving on November 21. The bundle isn't the only one on the way, either. A stinger at the end teases more to come, with 2B's boots and this tagline: \"A YoRHa soldier is approaching... Glory to mankind!\"\nLooks like we'll learn more on November 21, when Ubisoft reveals the entirety of its next season, Operation Solar Raid. There, according to Ubisoft, we'll get more \"NieR goodness\" for Siege.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D13DlspkIvE\nNieR and dear to our heart\nThe bundle shown off today is for Maverick, an Attack operator with a blowtorch. The set looks like it includes a cosmetic skin based off the brother Nier's appearance, rather than Papa Nier. I do like the design of the guns, as it's reminiscent of the black-and-gold aesthetic of the Shades. Grimoire Weiss is included in the bundle too, seemingly as a weapon charm.\nAs I mentioned before, this is hardly the first NieR crossover. Both the original NieR and NieR: Automata have crossed over into other games. In some cases, like Final Fantasy XIV's raid series, they even contain some additional details for fans.\nI doubt Rainbow Six Siege will hold any deep lore tidbits, but I can't rule it out. It's a goofy and enjoyable crossover though, and one that made me fondly reminisce on series director Yoko Taro's response in our latest interview with him.\nThe post The latest NieR crossover is with Rainbow Six Siege appeared first on Destructoid.",

Bucky Barnes, the Winter Soldier, will arrive in Marvel's Avengers on November 29.\nThe 2.7 update will add the once-frozen warrior to Avengers as a playable hero, alongside the Cloning Lab Omega-Level Threat. Bucky will also have his own chain of missions, which will reward an iconic outfit once completed.\nThe Winter Soldier will be voiced by Scott Porter, who also lent his voice to Bucky in Lego Marvel's Avengers. As for his playstyle, he's apparently an \"assault-focused hero\" who loves to do damage.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDBojdBAjXU\nThe Omega-Level Threat of the Cloning Lab carries on the MODOK storyline. It's an endgame encounter meant for a squad of players to tackle, and will require Power Level 175 to enter.\nAvengers, assembling\nBucky is the latest hero to join Marvel's Avengers, since Jane Foster's Thor took the field earlier this year. That brings the total hero count up to 12, if counting the PlayStation-exclusive Spider-Man.\nIt's also been a strange year for Crystal Dynamics, the team behind Marvel's Avengers. The studio was recently bought by Embracer Group, alongside Eidos Montreal and Square Enix Montreal. The latter would soon be renamed to Onoma before getting shut down.\nMeanwhile, Marvel's Avengers is still carrying on. The team says that updates past 2.7 will keep on revising and tuning heroes, as they've been doing with past patches. And Crystal Dynamics is also working on the next installment in the Tomb Raider franchise, too.\nThe post Marvel’s Avengers adds the Winter Soldier later this month appeared first on Destructoid.",

Both the child and dog need to be fed and the kitchen needs to be cleaned, but something feels off. In an explosive moment that truly caught me by surprise, the family is suddenly reckoning with an alien invasion. An intense, often scary adventure kicks off from there.

This news was revealed through a title card teased at the end of the Fortnite Champion Series, which took place over the weekend, as reported by Eurogamer. You can see the title card at the top of this story, if you're curious. \nUnfortunately, that's all that Epic Games teased in terms of the end of Fortnite's Fracture era. As for what's in store for Chapter 4 or what this finale event might play like, that remains unknown. Fortunately, we don't have to wait too much longer, though, because the event begins in just a few weeks. \nIf it's anything like previous Fortnite chapter finales, then expect huge PvE battles across the island, plenty of spectacle, an exciting conclusion, and of course, some downtime as the game prepares to launch the next chapter. \n[Source: Eurogamer]\nAre you tuning into the finale event for Fortnite Chapter 3?

Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. You can also catch up on previous episodes by visiting our new Game Informer Shows YouTube channel or watching the embedded episode below. \nMetal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. \n\n\nJoin me, Marcus Stewart, and Blake Hester as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure.

The news also provided insight into the sequel's development status. \nAccording to a press release, Control 2 (once known as Codename Heron) is currently in the concept phase, being built in Remedy’s proprietary Northlight engine. The game will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Remedy will publish the PC version while 505 will handle the game’s console releases. Control 2 has no release window, but Remedy did release a piece of concept art, posted below. \nThe press release also states that Control 2’s development budget initially sat at 50 million euros. Remedy and 505 will equally split marketing and development costs, as well as revenue generated by its release. Remedy retains full ownership of the Control IP, however. The press release also reveals that the first Control has sold over 3 million copies since launching in 2019. \n“We are excited to deepen our cooperation with Remedy and continue the success story of Control together,” say Rami and Raffi Galante, co-CEOs of Digital Bros Group/505 Games. “... Control is the biggest investment 505 Games has ever made, so it has a special place in our hearts. We are grateful to the whole player community that has made Control such a long-lasting and loved game, and are even more excited to bring out Control 2.”\nThis announcement was first teased last June, when Remedy and 505 revealed plans for new triple-A Control experiences. That same update revealed an upcoming multiplayer spin-off title known as Project Condor. Earlier this year, Remedy also struck a deal with Rockstar to develop remakes of Max Payne 1 and 2.",

A new trailer provides a deeper look into the adult animated series' premise and new heroes. \nThe story centers on Miriam, an elven mercenary and former slave tasked with stealing a powerful and dangerous artifact. When the heist goes awry, the situation escalates into a larger fight for survival for Miriam and her friends. Set in Tevinter, the show features an original cast of heroes and, potentially, some old favorites (the characters at 0:45 look a lot like Cassandra and Leliana). Check out the trailer below. \n\n\nFirst announced during Netflix Geeked Week in June, Dragon Age: Absolution’s cast includes Kimberly Brooks (Miriam), Matthew Mercer (Fairbanks), Ashly Burch (Qwydion), Phil Lamarr (Roland), and Josh Keaton (Rezaren). The series consists of six 30-minute episodes. \nThough steeped in Dragon Age lore, it remains to be seen if the show has any connection to the upcoming Dragon Age: Dreadwolf. Absolution is far from the only video game adaptation Netflix has in the works. The CG-animated Sonic Prime also premieres in December. The streaming giant also announced a live-action Gears of War movie and its own animated series.",

While we were in the city, Game Informer video editor Alex Van Aken and I thought it would be a great idea to take advantage of our proximity to Universal Studios Japan to visit Super Nintendo World. Like you, we saw the tour provided by the legendary Shigeru Miyamoto, but we needed to see it for ourselves. And to be quite frank, we are so glad that we did.\nIt's impossible to fully convey how cool most of our time at Super Nintendo World was.

The process started yesterday, and Google has posted an FAQ breaking down how it works. \nAs previously announced, Google is refunding all software purchases through the Stadia Store (such as games, DLC, in-game currency, and current pre-orders) and hardware purchases made through the Google Store; physical store purchases cannot be refunded. Eligible hardware includes:\nStadia Controller\nFounder's Edition\nPremiere Edition\nPlay and Watch with Google TV packages\nStadia Pro subscriptions will not be refunded, but members can play their Pro titles until the shutdown. However, those who purchased a subscription on or after September 29, 2022, and were charged for it will have that money returned. \nRefunds will be issued to the form of payment used to make the purchase. If that account is no longer available, Google will send an email with instructions for setting up an alternative method of receiving the refund.\nUsers may have already received an email notifying them of their refund status. Although payments are now being issued, that doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll get yours today or this week. This will be a gradual rollout that will continue up until January 18. There's no way of knowing when you'll receive your refund, so eligible users should keep an eye on their inbox and bank account over the coming days or weeks.",

Before that, we hadn't received a proper NFL-licensed Blitz title since Midway's NFL Blitz 20-03 on PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, and Game Boy Advance. Despite EA Sports acquiring the license from Midway during its 2009 liquidation, the NFL has largely seemed averse to the hard-hitting arcade-style gameplay of the Blitz series.\nIn August, Arcade1Up, the company behind various arcade replicas, including other Midway classics like NBA Jam and Mortal Kombat, announced the franchise's return through NFL Blitz Le…",

The current edition of D&D supports tremendous flexibility in playing out combat how you like, including through tabletop miniature play, allowing big battles to flow out from ongoing campaign storylines in your weekly sessions. However, perhaps your group is more into combat than interconnected storylines. Or, more likely, you sometimes just want a break from the campaign planning to have a focused evening of combat.

The studio has been quite open with its accessibility desires, detailing more than 60 in a blog post earlier this year. Now, with the game out on November 9, the studio has released an even more detailed post breaking down exactly what to expect. \n\n\nSanta Monica Studio says there are more than 70 features in Ragnarok that \"enable players to customize the gameplay experience to suit their needs\" and the list is a sight to behold. It includes plenty of presets, too, which could make it easier for players to easily get the game started in a way that makes the experience better for them. Presets include one for vision accessibility, hearing accessibility, motion reduction, apply motor accessibility, and a changed setting indicator as well. \nThere are alternative control schemes, remappable buttons, hold and press options, in-game assistance settings, and so much more. If you're interested in what accessibility features are in Ragnarok, be sure to check out the full blog post. \nFor more, read Game Informer's God of War Ragnarok review and then check out all of the performance and quality modes for the game. \nWhich accessibility features do you find most helpful in games?

As for why, she says the working dynamic with the game's audio director has become difficult and she sees no path forward. Variety reports that the audio director in question is Stephen Miller but Schachner doesn't name this person in her announcement. \nNews of her departure comes from a statement released by Schachner on Twitter on November 3, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. Schachner's departure comes after years of work with Modern Warfare II studio Infinity Ward on games like 2019's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and 2016's Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare. Other credits include Assassin's Creed Valhalla and Anthem, as noted by VGC. \n\"I am sad to say I can no longer continue to compose music for MWII/Warzone,\" her statement reads. \"Over the past couple of months, the working dynamic with the audio director has become increasingly challenging and I don't see any path forward. As of now, I am unsure of the status and release plan for the soundtrack as it's been taken out of my hands. While I don't have any control over how the music is presented in-game, what will be released on the soundtrack is not my artistic intent in regards to mixing and mastering.\" \nShe then thanks fans for their support and gives some shout outs to others involved with the game's score, including mixer Frank Wolf, \"creative vision\" Mike Dean, and performing artists including Baseck, Brain Mantia, and M.B. Gordy.\nYou can read her full statement below: \nMany of you have been asking about the MWII soundtrack release.\npic.twitter.com/UEqgpCTjUg\nNovember 3, 2022\nFor more, read Game Informer's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II review. \n[Source: Video Games Chronicle]\nWhat are your thoughts on the score of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II?

          "description": "Ubisoft has rolled out its post-launch content roadmap for Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope. Owners of the game’s season pass, whether purchased separately for $29.99 or bundled in the game’s $89.99 Gold Edition, have three big adventures aimed at keeping them glued to the game throughout 2023. \nIt all kicks off early next year with the first expansion, Tower of Doooom (their spelling, not mine). This introduces a new combat mode where the team must fight their way up Madame Bwahstrella’s multi-story tower to rescue Spawny, the visor-rocking Rabbid from Kingdom Battle. What’s important to note is that Tower of Doooom will be exclusive to the season pass, meaning you’ll be unable to purchase it separately. \nThe second untitled DLC arrives in mid-2023. So far, we only know it takes players to a new planet, features never-before-seen enemies, allies, and secrets, and stars a new antagonist. Finally, Rayman crashes the party in the final expansion to close out the year. Ubisoft’s limbless hero joins Rabbid Peach and Rabbid Mario on a separate adventure in a new location. Unlike Tower of Doooom, the second and third expansions can be purchased a la carte. \nI enjoyed Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope quite a bit, awarding it a 9 out of 10. In my review, which you can read here, I wrote that the game “builds upon Kingdom Battle’s foundation with smart tweaks and fun additions to emerge as a better game in every way.”",
