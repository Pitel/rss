          "description": "Alt.Ctrl.GDC is a regular fixture at the Game Developers Conference, and this year I spotted some properly incredible creations from its largely student-led group of exhibitors. There was a big focus on co-op games and time trial demos in this year's cohort, with nearly every stand having some sort of whiteboard pinned up that was constantly being scrubbed out with new fastest lap times and corresponding visitor names. There was also lots of friendly hooting emanating from them as well, as mates and strangers attempted to co-ordinate their gaggles of limbs to steer various game characters in the right direction. \nIt was excellent fun, and I sampled a bunch of games that used toasters, intricate pulley systems, papier-mache tree stumps, bike wheels and more in place of your typical controllers and mice and keyboard. There were also plenty more I didn't get to try out, mainly due to time, and you can see the full list over on GDC's website. For now, though, here are some personal highlights of what I saw, including the largest bowler hat I think I've ever seen in my life.\nRead more",

But less romantically, the title evokes Internet Explorer or Acrobat Reader - sitting comfortably alongside the clearly and sensibly labelled Windows software of the mid-90s. It’s a reminder of just how early Westwood happened upon the blueprint for real-time strategy, right as many PC users were buying their first trackball mice.\r\n\nBack then, the developer was fresh from Dune II, its unlikely David Lynch adaptation and progenitor of the RTS genre as we know it today. Inspired by the house politics and struggle for resources that consumed the desert planet Arrakis, Westwood had come up with an addictive formula for harvesting spice and converting that wealth into military power, which in turn could be used in the battle to secure more spice. The team was, quite frankly, surprised by how much fun that formula had turned out to be.\nRead more",

They’ve been inviting select players based on factors that are important to the dev team, such as trust factor, Steam account standing, and recent playtime on Valve servers. But last night, Valve shook their finger like a stern parent, informing fans that playing more Counter-Strike: Global Offensive wouldn’t get them into the CS2 test any faster.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "As is so often the case in systemic turn-based tactics games, things started to go wrong in my preview session for The Lamplighters League when a nearby torch met a cunningly placed oil slick and erupted into flames. A load of enemies were instantly enveloped in its hot sea of death, as intended, but one of our heroes - the tank-like bruiser Fedir - also ended up getting burned by mistake. As an ex-mob enforcer, he's certainly built to take a few punches, and his abilities are all focused on making him the centre of attention, his attacks growing more powerful as his rage levels continue to grow. \"You want him to get attacked,\" game director Chris Rogers tells me, calling on the phrase 'you wouldn't like him when he's angry' as the basis for Fedir's ability set. But with that extra fire damage he receives, it's just a little too much all at once. He gets knocked down, and the tide of battle quickly goes south.\nIn truth, I played no part in this downfall. Rogers was in the control cockpit for this one, showing me exactly how Harebrained Schemes' latest game actually works. It's quite a different proposition from their last game, Battletech, and in this quite literal trial by fire, studio head and co-founder Mitch Gitelman actually pulled a dollar out of his pocket at one point and put a bet on whether Rogers would make it out alive. He certainly had his work cut out for him. Rogers won that dollar, and here's how the game's emphasis on deep, customisable character builds set him up for success.\nRead more",

My eyes glued to notes floating across the screen, trying to hit them at just the right time, you’d probably see Time hiding in a corner to my left, giggling at my repeated failure.

          "description": "It has been said (by me) that a lot of games journalists are generalists in terms of what we play, especially if we're talking about people who are staffers at an outlet, or have ever worked in guides. Though we all have stuff we prefer, or series that we serve as the go-to expert on for in-house needs (I think vid bud Liam might actually walk around wearing an ASK ME ABOUT RESIDENT EVIL badge in his day-to-day life), we - unlike the blue-haired neo-Gods of streaming - often can't focus on one game all of the time. You have to know enough about enough to be able to write about enough.\nThere are, however, a bunch of big important games that I haven't played. Sometimes it's because a bunch of other people have, so that gap in the site's knowledge is already plugged (and I do always make sure to be aware of their impact and basic facts). Other times, they might be games that I'm not really interested in playing, either because they're not my genre or they seem too overwrought. Or, in some cases, it's because everyone says they're really good and I have to try them, though I've been burned before on this method (you people said the same about Ready Player One). But you know what would make me take in info about these games, even if it's just by osmosis? If they all got PowerWash Sim DLCs.\nRead more",

After finishing up work on two successful mobile games around four years ago, Humble was itching for something new. But he wasn't quite sure what. \"I was in the kitchen talking to my son about, 'Oh, what should I do? I don't know what opportunities there are,' and he was like, 'Why don't you just pick the company you want to work at and ask them?'\" And as a life-long Crusader Kings player, the answer was clear. \"Okay!?\" Humble says incredulously. \"I can do that, I guess. So I did. I wrote to [PR manager] Troy [Goodfellow], and he knew Fred [Wester, CEO], and that was it. It was two weeks later and I met him in San Francisco and said, hey, I'd like to start a studio, and here's the way I'd like to run it. And he was like, sure, let's go for it.\"\nSo began Humble's journey to creating Life By You, his upcoming life simulator that's set to give his former pet project, The Sims, a run for its money. With The Sims 5, or Project Rene as it's currently known, still some way off, Life By You seems poised to finally give life sim fans the game they've always wanted. \"I wanted to make an open world life simulator where the core tenant was freedom,\" says Humble. \"Where players could freely play and tell their stories with minimal friction.\" And what was standing in the way of that freedom? Loading screens, says Humble.\nRead more",

It's a purely military game about overcoming massed defences through attrition, both in localised real-time battles, and a turn-based strategic map. It's perhaps unfair to criticise it for repetition and some intermittent sense of futility, since a First World War game without them would defeat the point.

It differs in several key ways too, thankfully, from its more urban setting, its tactile power tools, and the ability to automate a lot of the gathering and crafting by putting residents to work for you.

You can watch my impressions of the demo in the video below:\nIn Mythwrecked you play as Alex, a backpacker who has washed up on the sun-drenched shores of Ambrosia Island. As she begins exploring, she soon realises that this island seems to be a hot spot for the gods from ancient Greek myths. Your task is to befriend each god, help them restore their memories, and find a way back to civilisation.\nFrom playing the demo, you can see much of what made Roki fun reflected in Mythwrecked. The environments are interesting to poke around in, puzzles are breezy brain ticklers, and it has Polygon Treehouse's sense of humour. Each Greek god has a humerous twist on their lore,  and during the demo I had a fun time chatting with Hermes, who is dressed in nothing more than a pair of skimpy white speedos and a matching white sweat band - a bold choice of attire.\n Read more",

This reimagining is set in the Gothic American south and in the main game you'll be playing as Edward Carnby or Emily Hartwood as they navigate the monster infested Derceto Manor, the same mansion featured in the demo.\n Read more",

There's a lot of cool booths, fun props, and generally weird stuff to see, so we've chosen our absolute favourites and have listed them in video form for your viewing pleasure.\nEverything at PAX East is situated in one massive hall (instead of PAX West's multiple floors, rooms, and buildings) so it's nice and easy to see everything in one or two loops. It doesn't feel cramped at all, even with Friday's busy crowds, and the booths are as spectacular as ever.\nSome of our favourites included Devolver Digital's movie theatre-inspired booth, which has the new addition of a candle-lit shrine for Cult Of The Lamb's upcoming free expansion Relics Of The Old Faith. We also loved Ysbryd Games' Demonschool booth which had a school desk layout and cool retro TV. Another favourite was the animated robot dinosaur (complete with rideable saddle) that we found at the Roots Of Pacha demo builds.\n Read more",

Some of the actors won't come out of their trailers. One of them will but if you shoot him from the front you realise he's got no eyes, but don't show the audience that. It's not intentional, he's getting them fixed. Also can you film it twice, for different streaming platforms? Make a really good version for Netflix and a slightly worse looking one for Quibi.”\r\n\n\r\nEvery so often a game trailer comes along that makes me think, hang on, that was bloody brilliant! I bet some people made that! Most recently it was Creative Assembly’s Immortal Empires trailer. Well, I’ve been digging around and I’m happy to report that yes, although I’m the first one to just see a trailer as an algorithm trying to snatch my coin purse away like a manure-encrusted Victorian ne’er-do-well, game trailers are made by humans. They're often humans who do it as as specific job, either in-house at a developer or as an outside agency like Realtime Nordic. Enlightened and enthralled, I asked some of them about what went into the strange space that is making the trailers for your favourite games. \r\n\n \nRead more",

Getting to see so many great developers have their games celebrated by their peers will always warm the old cockles, especially when we celebrated so many of them in our own RPS Advent Calendar at the end of last year. Well, I say 'see'. In truth, I was tucked away backstage at this year's IGF and GDC Awards, clutching my dictaphone with a single question in mind: if each winner had to give away their award to another game in their category, who would it be and why?   \nIt's an idea Brendan (RPS in peace) came up with back in the primordial mists of 2018, and it was so good I just had to knick it and do it again. It might be cruel to wrench these awards away so soon after receiving them, but it's all in the name of spreading good vibes and extra shoutouts, I promise. So here are the games of the year 2022, according to the people who just won awards for games of the year 2022.\nRead more",

We first came across Demonschool back at PAX West last year and have loved it ever since. It's a slick, tactical Persona-like where you play as a band of university students navigating school life by day and beating up ghosties and ghoulies by night.\nI had a chat with Demonschool's Jenna Stoeber who talked me through what Demonschool is about, the game's many horror inspirations, and what spooky shinanigans players can expect. If the giant skeleton lad in the game's trailer and demo is anything to go by, we're in for a treat. You can watch the full interview by watching the video below:\n\nIf you've haven't yet, set your peepers on Demonschool's slick trailer to see what demon hunter Faye and her gang of misfits are up against. There's no concrete release date, but like Jenna said, Demonschool should be out sometime in 2023 with a playable demo available in May.\nWe've got plenty more interviews, demos, and highlights lined up for the rest of the week and you can find all our PAX East coverage by checking out our RPS@PAX tag. \n \nRead more",

          "description": "Men Of War 2 doesn't do anything by half measures, as I discovered during a recent tussle with its online multiplayer modes. Whereas Relic's recently released Company Of Heroes 3 will let you pick from its four broad faction types in its WWII RTS battles, Men Of War 2 takes a much more granular view, offering up 14-15 different unit types for each of its three playable nations. That's a dizzying array of infantry, tank and artillery battalions to choose from, and that's before you account for all the individual nuances between its Soviet, USA and German army types. Throw in seven game modes across several different maps, and it's a veritable strategy smorgasbord to stuff your face into. \nCrucially, though, everyone gets access to some sort of tank, which let's face it, is always going to be the MVP of any WW2 strategy game, and probably the sole reason why we're here in the first place. As Men Of War 2 heads into its first open multiplayer tech test on Steam today (running until March 27th), here's my full report of my mildly doomed multiplayer tankventures in its Combat, Front Line and Incursion modes.\nRead more",

There are a lot of terrible things that call the oceans of The Marrows home in this melancholy fishing adventure, but what they are, I couldn't possibly tell you. In all my hours sailing these cursed waters, I've only ever seen brief flashes of them - their ungodly, slippery masses, long spiny fins, and a dozen different combinations of glowing eyes, teeth and tentacles. They're forever fading in and out of view, cloaked by the thick fog that blankets the sea every evening. Sometimes your ship lights will catch them for a split second before they slip away, or maybe you'll only hear them hurtling toward you, with a scream of a jet engine and a maw that's white hot, ready for gnashing your flimsy wooden carcass into sawdust. \nIt's unnerving, being out at sea after dark, but that's the time when the rarest and most vile catches raise their scaly heads. So the question becomes: are you willing to risk your own sanity for the sake of a quick buck? Or are you too afraid of what you'll find in Davy Jones' locker? In Dredge, the answer is always yes. Yes, you will be frightened of what's out there, whether it's real or born from your own fearful imaginings, but you'll sputter out into the darkness regardless, because the allure of this supernatural fishing sim is just too good to resist.\nRead more",

Skyrim’s “I used to be an adventurer like you” is probably the most famous example of a bark. Ubisoft Ghostwriter has been met with passionately negative responses from some narrative designers, while others have been arguing for its use cases. \r\n\n \nRead more",

For each puzzle you're given a set of characters and scenarios (the Baron, the Knight, the Queen; a wedding, a kidnap, an execution) and are tasked with arranging them in a combination that fits the story title you're given (The Queen Marries). It's playful and cute, with surprising depth that draws inspiration from classic stories. It's also very short. I'd wager you'll have hunnerpercented Storyteller in two hours max, which will sound like mana from heaven to some, but may disappoint you if you've been waiting for Storyteller for over a decade.\nRead more",

I remember a chill ran down my spine as I cast my mind back to Far Cry 6, where the tutorial island itself was longer than anything else I'd played that year. I was scared Redfall might succumb to a similar fate. I imagined it filling my head with map markers until my head swelled, popped like a balloon, and dropped grey rarity brain matter.\nWell, having given Redfall a go for 90 minutes I was, perhaps, being a bit dramatic. The game may be open world, and may have some slightly jarring open world-isms, but I felt like Arkane's magic wasn't diluted by it all. Their talent for storytelling and level design bubbled to the surface constantly, making exploration a genuine joy. Sure, I have some reservations, but I can't deny that I'm itching to play it again.\nRead more",

Lucky for us, that's not really what we're talking about here, although we do use that as a jumping-off point for our chat.\nInstead, we try to come up with an Indiescovery Manifesto, one that will guide us in the future when we're thinking about what games we ought to cover on the pod. We achieve this through a lively discussion that mainly involves me playing devil's advocate by throwing out ridiculous edge cases until Rachel and Liam want to break down and weep.

          "description": "The company also plans to review its real-estate footprint\nEA has announced it will be laying off roughly 6% of its workforce as part of a restructuring effort.\nElectronic Arts' most recent reports (via GamesIndustry.biz) put that number around 775. The publisher is also taking a look at its real estate and shifting its strategy.\n\"As we drive greater focus across our portfolio, we are moving away from projects that do not contribute to our strategy, reviewing our real estate footprint, and restructuring some of our teams,\" said CEO Andrew Wilson in a note to staff.\n\"This is the most difficult part, and we are working through the process with the utmost care and respect. Where we can, we are providing opportunities for our colleagues to transition onto other projects,\" Wilson said. \"Where that's not possible, we are providing severance pay and additional benefits such as health care and career transition services.\"\nEA started informing employees earlier in the quarter, and the publisher expects to be informing more affected workers into the next fiscal year, starting April 1.\nAdditionally, Wilson said the company is \"operating from a position of strength\" and will be focusing on a handful of priorities moving forward. This includes building games with large communities, making the most of those communities with social and creator tools, and creating blockbuster interactive storytelling.\nMore tech layoffs\nSome cuts to the workforce at EA were already made earlier this year, as over 200 QA staff working on Apex Legends were laid off recently from the Baton Rouge team.\nMeanwhile, Respawn recently announced a new studio to bolster Apex Legends development in Madison, Wisconsin.\nThe post EA is laying off 6% of its workforce amid restructuring appeared first on Destructoid.",

And while it's hitting many of the same notes as its predecessor, we got to go hands-on with its new spin on turn-based warfare: the Conquest mode.\nThe Conquest mode is one of Wargroove 2's big new features. It's a roguelike approach to battles that follows a familiar structure if you've ever played other styles of roguelike. Yet for all the familiarity of this concept, it wound up being a pretty refreshing take on the turn-by-turn fights of Wargroove.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL8C_8u_jyI\nAssemble the army\nStarting out my demo at PAX East 2023, I was given the main Commander Nadia.

Not that it’s difficult. A happy memory can depress me.\nAnyway, a portion of Mortal Meal was featured on the Haunted PS1 Demo Disc: Spectral Mall compilation that was released back in 2022. The Haunted PS1 Demo Disc is sort of a nexus for experimental, lo-fi horror, and somehow I’m not on their mailing list. Thankfully, it usually passes my radar eventually.\nMortal Meal is perhaps a direct take on the genre, being largely a walking simulator. It’s also not terribly scary, but then, how would I know? It’s more focused on telling a melancholic narrative while weaving in a bit of levity and some fantastic horror imagery.\n[caption…",

It was a roughly 10-minute slice of gameplay, the most we've seen of the game thus far. And for me, I don't think I need to see any more of it until launch.\nZelda's gameplay showcase, hosted by series producer Eiji Aonuma, might seem unassuming compared to other big gameplay spotlights. It had the same tenor as the character reveals for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate; rather than make a big production or splice together a sizzle reel, it was just a chopped-and-guided tour through the new Hyrule. For one of year's biggest presumptive hits, it was a chill stream that let the game speak for itself. And it really did talk.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/wa…",

Pre-sale tickets are live now, and you can get them here.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETr8BrD_Fp0\nTicket pricing tiers for the Shin Megami Tensei Anime Expo concert:\nVIP Pit (Standing) = $95\nVIP Balcony = $85\nGA Floor (Standing) = $70\nGA Balcony = $50\nSimilar to many Comic-Cons and the like, there's an add-on, too:\n\"A pre-show reception is scheduled and will feature early access to concert merchandise, a meet-and-greet with the show hosts, a themed autograph card signed by the show hosts, light hors d'oeuvres, and more.

Free for the month of April will be Sackboy: The Big Adventure, Meet Your Maker, and Tails of Iron.\nhttps://youtu.be/ZOk3fj5ujNM\nBeginning with Sackboy: The Big Adventure, this 2020 LittleBigPlanet spin-off was described as Destructoid’s resident snack-cake, Chris Carter, as a “chill platformer.” It ditches the creation suite that was such a focus of the LittleBigPlanet games to instead create a unique and charming platformer.\nhttps://youtu.be/ncT9bACGd5Q\nNext up is Meet Your Maker from Behaviour Interactive. This title is currently unreleased, so it you’ll be able to grab it free on its launch date if you’re a PlayStation Plus subscriber. Behaviour Interactive describes it as a first-person build and raid game. It has a co-op and base-building focus, so it’s something to grab if you need a game to share with a friend. If you have one.\nhttps://youtu.be/TMJF8hH8RGE\nFinally, Tails of Iron is a Souls-like action-RPG, that Destructoid’s resident tough-lad, Chris Moyse, described as one of the most distinctive RPG experiences of 2021.\nThere’s nothing on this list that strikes me as something I need to download and play right away, but they’re all welcome additions to the library. Sackboy and Tails of Iron are both well-loved titles, while Meet Your Maker still needs to prove itself in the crucible of opinion.\nSackboy: The Big Adventure, Meet Your Maker, and Tails of Iron will be available to all PlayStation Plus subscribers on April 4, 2023 until May 1.\nThe post Sackboy gets offered up on the Monthly Playstation Plus altar for April appeared first on Destructoid.",

The special story DLC \"In Tanta We Trust\" arrives for Forspoken on PS5 and PC on May 26.\nThe DLC will dive into the world of Athia and its past, before the events of the main game. As Square Enix describes it, this DLC will show the battle that drove the Tantas to madness.\nhttps://twitter.com/Forspoken/status/1641062989724884994/\nThe DLC will be up for purchase on May 26, and will also be available for owners of the Digital Deluxe Edition of Forspoken. If you got that version, you'll also get a few days' early access to the DLC.\nA new view of Athia\nForspoken was one of the first big games of 2023, and received a fairly lukewarm reception. In our own look at the game, it seems like Forspoken plays it safe in many areas, but does have some neat visuals and cool concept for its combat.\nStill, that's not always enough to save a game from the fallout. Square Enix announced that Luminous Productions, after launching Forspoken, is being absorbed into Square Enix. The publisher also characterized sales of Forspoken as \"lackluster,\" and review of it were \"challenging.\"\nMeanwhile, Square Enix president Yosuke Matsuda confirmed he's stepping down in June, with current company director Takashi Kiryu stepping up pending shareholder approval. It's a season of change for Square Enix, as some games miss marks and leadership shifts around, following a year where the company sold off some big studios.\nThe Forspoken story DLC In Tanta We Trust will drop for PS5 and PC on May 26.\nThe post Forspoken story DLC In Tanta We Trust arrives in May appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The phoenix rises\nThat was fast. Bandai Namco has dropped yet another trailer for Tekken 8, this one focusing on Ling Xiaoyu. Ling was previously unannounced for the game, so this trailer is a big reveal for her. I’m mostly just surprised that this happened so quickly after Jun Kazama capped off the reveal trailers for their already-revealed cast.\nThis maybe shouldn’t be a huge surprise. Ling Xiaoyu was introduced way back in Tekken 3 and has been in every entry since. She initially wanted to win enough money to build her own amusement park but eventually got wrapped up in the family drama of the Kazama family.\nhttps://youtu.be/vTd2XeL4ygQ\nThe trailer shows Ling Xiaoyu kicking her winged slippers at Nina Williams and King, who commenters have pointed out were her foes in the Tekken: Bloodline anime. Much of the time, she’s wearing her trademark smile right up until she gets mad and nukes King’s well-developed abs.\nLing Xiaoyu gets the spotlight after the previously shown characters: Jin Kazama, Marshall Law, Nina Williams, King, Paul Phoenix, Jack-8, Lars Alexandersson, Kazuya Mishima, and Jun Kazama. Bandai Namco hasn’t said how large the roster is going to be, exactly, but they’ve certainly got a brisk pace going on with these trailers.\nTekken 8 is currently in development for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X. It is tentatively expected to launch late in 2023 or early 2024.\nThe post Ling Xiaoyu doesn’t lose focus in the latest Tekken 8 trailer appeared first on Destructoid.",

This newest one unfortunately is the former; and oh, it's also tied to GameStop. Just like the flying Pikachu doled out at the launch of the new generation, this promo Pokemon is also in flight: and it's a pig. Get it?! With April Fools' coming up, you know someone couldn't resist. Yep, it's a flying tera type Lechonk.\nIf you follow the GameStop link in the announcement tweet, you'll just get a generic \"find a GameStop in my area\" landing page. But TCG site Pokebeach has more info, noting that the codes will be available in stores on March 31, in an effort to tie it to the Scarlet & Violet new TCG set. Welp, marketing kinda botched that connection! Pokebeach says that there is no purchase necessary for these promo cards (as in the past), which will provide a code to download the flying Lechonk.\nThere's also a separate promo going on featuring the Pokemon TCG, which is potentially linked to a $15 in-store purchase, as a reverse holo card. I say \"potentially\" because individual stores might not require said purchase, but that's going to be up to the stores themselves.\nEither way, you can get a free Lechonk.

Tactics games are quite popular, as are their often-accompanying social mechanics and life-sim elements. So combining demons and school makes sense.\nBut Demonschool is a lot more than the sum of its parts. It's a sleek, engaging tactics game that gets right to the thick of things. It's a school life sim that easily slots into the overall drives of the story.

This event will run from March 31 to April 2, and it will repeat the following weekend from April 7 to April 9.\nOne of the most challenging aspects of 7-Star raids is sheer unpredictability. The moveset of any Pokemon can completely change which monster will counter it best, so it’s almost impossible to prepare for an event before it goes live. For example, Samurott is a Water-Type Pokemon with a Bug Tera Type, which means Flying-Type Pokemon should be the best counters. However, if Samurott knows an Ice-Type move, the best Pokemon may be Walking Wake with Flamethrower or a Skill Link Cloyster with Rock Blast.\nAs unpredictable as r…",

This one, released in late March 2023, involves a \"Boston-themed banner.\" No, it's not a Dunkin Donuts/Ben Affleck promo. But there is a lobster (lobstah?) involved.\nhttps://twitter.com/SplatoonNA/status/1640186892908937217\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNdesjIP2AA&t=7079s\nSaid banner is Boston-themed because of the recent Splatoon 3 tournament sponsored by Nintendo: which was held at PAX East this past weekend in Boston, Massachusetts. Team Starburst beat out team Destiny Bond with a sweep, becoming the winners of the 2023 Splatoon 3 North American Championship. Hey look, it's a free gift! Take it or leave it.\nScan this QR code for the Splatoon 3 Boston reward:\n[caption id=\"attachment_371169\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"512\"] Image via Nintendo[/caption]\nFirst off, you can’t just scan the QR code with your camera app on your phone. You’ll need to go download the Nintendo Switch Online app on either iOS or Android.\nOnce you have the app, load it up, log into your Nintendo Switch Online account, and look for the Splatoon 3 icon at the top. That’s actually “Splatnet 3,” and it’s the app-within-the-app that you’ll need to use to scan the below codes.\nAfter Splatnet 3 loads, scroll to the bottom and look for the “QR Code Reader” icon.\nSelect “use your smartphone’s camera to scan a QR code” to directly scan codes from this article, or select “scan a QR code from a saved image” (you may need to give your app access to your phone’s camera or image collection).\nThat’s it! The code will then redeem and you’ll be able to pick the reward up from the in-game terminal.

At this point, the list of companies not attending outsizes the ones who have confirmed they are.\nWhile the two biggest takeaways from IGN’s article is that Sega and Tencent won’t be on the floor, they also received word that Devolver Digital isn’t attending in any capacity. While the publisher would often set up shop in the parking lot as an unofficial demonstration, this year, they’re not even planning that. There will be a Devolver Direct in June, however.\nIt’s not looking good for E3, which was already facing an uphill battle in re-establishing itself after the COVID pandemic. While video game conventions and shows are still widespread, E3 has long been held as a sort of video game Christmas that all gamers look forward to. Big game and hardware announcements were withheld for this time of year.\nThe expo’s battle for relevancy won’t end this year. IGN reached out to numerous publishers to get a response on whether they’ll be attending and got mostly radio silence. While that doesn’t mean they definitely won’t be there, in a normal year, most companies would have announced their intentions already.\nI have mixed feelings about this, but mainly I’m rooting for E3. It’s been running since I was a kid, and I remember getting excited for it and watching video game news. It’s different now that the internet has changed the speed at which we can hear of new events, so maybe this is the unavoidable future, but I’m going to miss that hype-based burst of dopamine.\nThe post Sega, Tencent, and Devolver announce they will not attend E3 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Time for an upgrade?\nI hope you weren’t too attached to that Aero interface, because Valve has announced that its Steam client will no longer support Windows 7, 8, or 8.1 starting on January 1, 2024.\nIn a support article, Valve states that “The newest features in Steam rely on an embedded version of Google Chrome, which no longer functions on older versions of Windows. In addition, future versions of Steam will require Windows feature and security updates only present in Windows 10 and above.”\nWhile this specifically impacts the Steam client, it also means that you won’t be able to launch games from it. It’s not clear if you can stick with an older version and turn updates off, but Valve is suggesting it’s time to upgrade.\nMaybe that’s true. Personally, I think Windows 7 was a great step up from Windows XP. Everything that followed has been a bigger and bigger mess that I mostly tolerate and hope that nothing breaks. I worked in I.T. during the transition from XP to 7 (we’ll pretend Vista never happened, the business world certainly did). When 8 came along, it was horrible for businesses, and Microsoft basically had to strongarm companies to move off of Windows 7 by ending support for it. Windows 10 isn’t bad, I guess. Windows 11… works.\nIn any case, if you want to keep using Steam, you’ll want to consider letting go of those better days and get back on the Operating System treadmill.

This one focuses on Jun Kazama, as she complains about violence while unloading on her family.\nJun Kazama was featured in Tekken 2 and the non-canon Tag Tournament games. She went missing at the beginning of Tekken 3’s narrative, so her return has been a long time coming. She’s the mother of Jin Kazuma, who she had with Kazuya Mishima.\nShe shows up in some flowing silks which, like the wardrobe of some other characters, seem far too nice to actually fight in. She seems to be some sort of Disney Princess, as nature just loves her, though that might be to highlight her peaceful nature. Despite her disgust with conflict, she’s depicted as showing no hesitation in beating the stuffing out of her son.\nhttps://youtu.be/oLKmcOp_PlM\nWith Jun Kazama, Bandai Namco has given a highlight trailer for all announced characters, including the previous ones: Jin Kazama, Marshall Law, Nina Williams, King, Paul Phoenix, Jack-8, Lars Alexandersson, and Kazuya Mishima.

          "description": "Not Gundam… yet\nCurve Digital has announced that they’re helping assemble Kitbash Model Club, a game by Floating Origin Interactive and helmed by Kerbal Space Program lead developer Felipe Falanghe. Previously known as Balsa Model Flight Simulator, Kitbash Model Club is a game about designing and testing out various types of vehicular models.\nThe trailer that dropped alongside the announcement shows off the various types of models you’ll be making, as well as some of the modes and the design suite. You can definitely see the Kerbal DNA in Kitbash Model Club, as it seems to focus on experimentation. Once you’ve got a built model, you take it out into Wirraway to test them out. While not much is shown in the way of gameplay objectives, it does demonstrate the RC dogfighting, which allows you to “challenge friends.”\nhttps://youtu.be/jU1aYokrbDA\nI’m liking what I see, and I absolutely love Kerbal, but I feel like I need to see more of what I’m actually going to be doing with these models before I can really get excited. Creation for the sake of creation is something I can already do in so many games, so I’m more interested in what these abominations of model design will be doing.\nFortunately, the store page lists a full career with “paintball combat missions, races, and maneuverability challenges.” There’s also going to be a scenario editor where you can create your missions and share them out. Neat.\nKitbash Model Club is initially eying up a PC release and is aiming to be out sometime in 2023.\nThe post Kitbash Model Club is a Kerbal-like game about making models appeared first on Destructoid.",

Are weapons still made of porcelain?\nYes. Yes they are.\nEarly on in the gameplay footage, Link is depicted battling it out with a construct using a tree branch. It doesn’t take long before that branch shifts into a “badly damaged” before breaking entirely.

We have a couple months until release, but anyone looking for a Switch upgrade before then has a tantalizing prospect.\nA special edition Tears of the Kingdom OLED Switch will launch on April 28, 2023. Sporting gold colors that have long been synonymous with the franchise, this is looking like a treat for Zelda collectors. Even the dock sports a vibrant display that will look great when you aren't playing in handheld mode. Remember, the system itself is otherwise identical to the regular OLED Nintendo Switch. If you're not interested in the aesthetics or already own an OLED Switch, this won't do too much for you.\n[caption id=\"attachment_371082\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Nintendo[/caption]\nBut wait, there's more!\nAdditionally, a corresponding Switch Pro Controller and carrying case will be available on May 12, the same date that the game itself will launch. These will run you $74.99 and $24.99 respectively, roughly $5 more than each peripheral's standard counterparts. Again, for Zelda fans and collectors, these are perfectly fair deals. I can't tell anyone else if a couple Triforces are worth $10, but I also buy video games I never actually play, so I'm not a reliable source for monetary advice.\nEven if a Tears of the Kingdom OLED Switch is no surprise, it's nice to see it officially announced. Nintendo says the special edition system and accompanying accessories are available to pre-order (potentially today), but no listings seem to be up following the broadcast. Keep your eyes peeled if these interest you, as other Tears of the Kingdom collectibles have already sold out at many retailers.\nThe post Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom gets a special edition OLED in April appeared first on Destructoid.",

She arrives at the Purge of Rheddig, the battle that caused Athia’s collapse and pushed the Tantas to madness. Frey must now fight to save this era of Athia, and she has backup in the form of Tanta Cinta. Frey gains new magical powers, including tag-team-focused abilities that utilize Tanta Cinta’s talents. The DLC also features new environments for players to scale using Frey’s parkour skills. \nForspoken: In Tanta We Trust is a paid expansion that launches on May 26.

In a statement to Video Games Chronicle, the publisher reveals that it will instead hold its own live presentation on June 12 in Los Angeles. \nThe publisher statement to VGC reads “While we initially intended to have an official E3 presence, we’ve made the subsequent decision to move in a different direction, and will be holding a Ubisoft Forward Live event on 12th June in Los Angeles. We look forward to sharing more details with our players very soon.”\nUbisoft CEO Yves Guillemot stated in February that the company would commit to attending “if E3 happens”. If that's the case, this news certainly doesn’t bode well for the fate of what’s supposed to be E3’s big return. \nAs for what Ubisoft could show at its event, Assassin’s Creed Mirage, The Crew Motorfest, and (maybe) Skull and Bones are slated to release this year. Other announced projects include the long-quiet Splinter Cell and Prince of Persia remakes, a multitude of new Assassin’s Creed games, and Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. A rumored follow-up to Immortals Fenyx Rising could also make an appearance.  \nUbisoft joins Nintendo on the list of major publishers that have declined to participate in this year’s show, following a previous report that Microsoft and Sony plan to follow suit. E3 is largely organized by ReedPop this year and will take place June 13-16 at the Los Angeles Convention Center. The event will open its doors to fans and press, with separate attendance days for each. It will be the first in-person event since 2019.\n[Source: Video Games Chronicle]\nWhat do you think of Ubisoft skipping E3? Do you expect the event to still take place?

The game’s online modes will later become unplayable as developer Player First Games plans for a relaunch early next year. \nIn a developer blog post, Player First Games CEO Tony Huynh explains that since MultiVersus launched in open beta (yes, open beta) last July, players have offered a ton of feedback. The studio feels that the only way to properly implement improvements based on these fan requests is to shut the game down temporarily. Huynh writes,\n“We know there’s still a lot of work to do.

It was a special edition that came with a code for Wind Waker HD and a gamepad emblazoned with a golden Triforce. For my brother and I, 11 and 13 at the time, respectively, this was a massive deal; we’d spent the last year seeing Wii Us at friends’ houses, yearning for our own, and struggling to explain the difference between it and our current Wii to our parents.\nBut while it was valuable to us, the Wii U struggled to sell and has ultimately gone down as one of Nintendo’s most disappointing consoles. Today, the system’s eShop shuts down forever, permanently closing a chapter of Nintendo’s history.\nI’ll be the first to admit that the rosy lenses of nostalgia heavily tint my memory of the Wii U.

To know that a game heavily inspired by Chrono Trigger will feature music from the man behind its score is exciting. Still, it is worth being excited for the soundtrack that Mitsuda will not be directly involved with, as well.\nThe majority of Sea of Stars’ soundtrack is in the hands of the talented Eric W. Brown, who also composed the soundtrack for The Messenger. Brown’s musical history started with playing drums in metal bands. “I've been a drummer since I was a kid and I'm still a drummer now, but, you know, I got into music production via chiptune essentially,” Brown says.  Around 2006 he decided to focus on making music on his own in the chiptune genre, primarily on Game…",

          "description": "A video game based on the hit Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles graphic novel The Last Ronin is in the works, Polygon reports.\nThe news comes from Polygon's interview with Doug Rosen, senior vice president for games and emerging media at Paramount Global. According to Rosen, The Last Ronin video game will be a single-player action role-playing title in the vein of the Norse-themed God of War series. Like the story it adapts, the game will feature a mature tone. The game’s developer has not been named, and the project is years away from release. \nThe Last Ronin was published in 2020 as a five-issue mini-series by IDW. It takes place in a dark futuristic New York, where three of the four turtles have been killed. The surviving turtle, whose identity is revealed at the end of the first issue (we won’t spoil it), dons a black mask and seeks revenge by fighting crime using both his and the weapons of his fallen brothers. \nIt’s a cool (and very grim) story if you haven’t read it, and we’re excited to see it translated into a game. Rosen also mentions in the same interview that Paramount sees opportunities to create different types of TMNT games that target young and adult audiences. \nThe Turtles are enjoying quite the renaissance lately thanks to the launch of the well-received beat ‘em up Shredder’s Revenge last year, the nostalgia trip of the Cowabunga Collection, a Shredder-themed Call of Duty pack, and even a new animated film coming to theaters this August.  \n[Source: Polygon]",

Despite some shortcomings, the compilation remains the best official way to experience those classic games from Genesis and Sega CD three decades following their original releases. Today, Sega announced the bundle is about to get better through Sonic Origins Plus, a premium upgrade that arrives a year after the collection's initial launch.\nSonic Origins Plus brings forward all the features of Sonic Origins delivered last year – Classic Mode, Anniversary Mode, widescreen support, added story animations, a virtual museum, and more – while adding a bunch of new content. First up, Sonic Origins Plus adds all 12 Sonic Game Gear games to the museum.\nThe full list of Game Gear games getting added is listed below.\nDr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine\nSonic Blast\nSonic Chaos\nSonic Drift\nSonic Drift 2\nSonic Labyrinth\nSonic Spinball\nSonic the Hedgehog\nSonic the Hedgehog 2\nSonic the Hedgehog Triple Trouble\nTails Adventure\nTails' Sky Patrol\nOn top of that, Amy joins the roster of playable characters in the Genesis and Sega CD titles (Sonic 1, Sonic 2, Sonic 3 & Knuckles, and Sonic CD). One of the strangest exclusions in the original Sonic Origins release is also rectified, as Knuckles will become playable in Sonic CD. Sadly, this first press release does not make any mention of restoring the replaced music in Sonic the Hedgehog 3.\n\n\nSonic Origins Plus arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on June 23. If you don't already own the initial release of Sonic Origins, the digital version of Sonic Origins Plus costs $40. The physical version, which includes a 20-page artbook and reversible coversheet with new art, also costs $40. If you already own Sonic Origins, you can upgrade to Plus for $10.

However, your squadmates can perish permanently, but you can raise your survival odds by outfitting soldiers with various weapons and upgrades to ensure the best team composition.\n\n\nAliens: Dark Descent is being devleoped by Tindalos Interactive, makers of the Battlefleet Gothic: Armada series, and will be published by Focus Entertainment. It arrives on June 20 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.",

          "description": "Arkane was developing a PlayStation 5 version of its upcoming first-person vampire shooter, Redfall, before Microsoft acquired Bethesda in 2020. However, following the acquisition, the PS5 version of the game was canceled by Microsoft, according to Arkane director Harvey Smith in an interview with IGN France (translated by IGN). \nDiscussing this with IGN France, Smith said, \"We got bought by Microsoft and that was a huge sea change. They said, 'No PlayStation 5. Now we're gonna do Game Pass, Xbox and PC.'\"\n\n\nSmith said Arkane didn't mind the decision, even if Redfall was originally meant to release on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. \n\"Support from Game Pass and having to worry about one less platform, one less complexity,\" Smith told IGN France. \"And Game Pass has a ton of people that can play. It could be our biggest game ever because of the 30 million Game Pass [members] or whatever that number is.\" \nNews of this canceled PS5 version of Redfall doesn't come as much of a surprise. When Redfall was revealed during a 2021 Xbox and Bethesda E3 showcase, it was revealed as an Xbox console exclusive. And considering it's par for the course for companies like PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo to keep their first-party releases off of competitor consoles, it's also not surprising Microsoft opted to make Redfall an Xbox exclusive after it acquired Bethesda. \nA spokesperson for Microsoft responded to this story, providing the following statement: \nRedfall hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC on May 2. \nFor more about the game, watch the latest Redfall story trailer that introduces some of the vampiric big bass and then watch this gameplay trailer that invites you out to a bloody night on the town. \n[Source: IGN France via IGN]\nAre you excited for Redfall?

This beta will feature Crash Bandicoot, Coco Bandicoot, Tawna Bandicoot, Doctor Neo Cortex, and Dingodile. \n\n\nThe game will cost $29.99 but a deluxe edition for $39.99 will also be available. Crash Team Rumble will also include a battle pass and both editions include the first season's pass. The deluxe edition will also include the Season 2 battle pass, a free 25-tier boost for Season 1, and the digital proto pack, which brings \"Blocky\" skins to the game alongside some equippable items, according to VGC. \nPreviews released today mention three different roles in Crash Team Rumble: Booster, Blocker, and Scorer. Using these three roles in a MOBA-like fashion, players will need to collect as much Wumpa Fruit as possible and bring it to their zone. If you've played 2021's Pokemon Unite, you probably get the gist here. \n\nCrash Team Rumble will feature crossplay.

The game quickly became one of the top-selling games in the history of the popular console, and now, it's time for the new generation to kick off within the popular Pokémon Trading Card Game. The inaugural Pokémon Scarlet & Violet expansion does more than just introduce the ninth generation of Pokémon into the TCG; it also implements a whole host of changes, not the least of which is a higher price tag for most items. \nHowever, along with that price increase come several benefits, including a new guarantee of three foil cards in every booster pack, plus the introduction of the silver border in the U.S. and other quality-of-life improvements with regards to the designs. The Pokémon Company sent over several booster packs for us to crack open and see what we could pull. While I was less frequently blown away by the big cards I pulled, this is one of the most robust galleries of \"the coolest cards\" articles I've done in a great many expansions. Partially, that is due to me enjoying seeing some of the newer Pokémon from Gen IX getting their first cards, but I can't help but think the increase in foil cards was to thank.\nIn total, the Pokémon Scarlet & Violet expansion introduces more than 190 new cards, including more than 10 new Pokémon ex cards, more than 30 Trainer cards, new Tera Pokémon, and tons of special-illustration Pokémon and Trainer cards. You can see the coolest cards we pulled from this expansion in the gallery below:\n\n Pokémon Trading Card Game: Scarlet & Violet is available starting on March 31.
