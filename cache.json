It’s undoubtedly the highlight of an outing that underwhelms in places and suffers from a few Switch-specific performance issues here and there. But, when all’s said and done MLB The Show 23 still manages to serve up a decent overall package.\nLet's start with where this one is most lacking, and MLB The Show 23 once again fails to address a few issues that have been fairly long-standing with the game at this point. Both its Franchise and Road to the Show modes do little to make themselves stand out over previous entries, continuing to take a firm back seat to the centrepiece Diamond Dynasty. That’s not to say getting involved with either of these is a total let-down — they’re still perfectly fine — they just feel a little flat and uninvolved in terms of presentation and there are few reasons to stick with them compared to Diamond Dynasty and the new Storylines offering.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "*spooking intensifies*.\nIt’s remarkable how easy it can be to see the effects of developers' genuine passion when playing a video game. In Kraino Origins—the product of one man, Angel Dorantes—you can just feel how much appreciation the dev has for classic retro platformers. Better yet, it turns out that he clearly understands what made the classics so great; Kraino Origins is a good time.\nYou take the role of the titular skeleton and are tasked with going through eight levels of spooky, scary action. Gameplay takes the shape of a typical retro action platformer, and Kraino is clearly inspired by many of the classics. There’s a little bit of Mega Man in here, a little more Castlevania, some Super Mario Bros. 3, but Kraino doesn’t feel overly derivative of such titles, largely because of its excellent level design. Each level is thematically distinct and introduces a few unique level gimmicks, such as conveyor belts or floating leaves, which are slowly built up into harder challenges over the course of the stage.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Balsa Model Flight Simulator launched into Steam Early Access last year, to positive reviews and few sales. It is, like its developer's previous game Kerbal Space Program, about building a machine designed to fly, crashing it back to earth, then constructing something better. \r\n\nNow its developer has announced they're doing something similar with the game itself. Balsa Model Flight Sim will relaunch later this year with a new name, Kitbash Model Club, a more ambitious physics construction sandbox, and a plan to release as a complete game rather than into early access. Existing owners of Balsa Model Flight Simulator will get Kitbash Model Club for free.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "As is so often the case in systemic turn-based tactics games, things started to go wrong in my preview session for The Lamplighters League when a nearby torch met a cunningly placed oil slick and erupted into flames. A load of enemies were instantly enveloped in its hot sea of death, as intended, but one of our heroes - the tank-like bruiser Fedir - also ended up getting burned by mistake. As an ex-mob enforcer, he's certainly built to take a few punches, and his abilities are all focused on making him the centre of attention, his attacks growing more powerful as his rage levels continue to grow. \"You want him to get attacked,\" game director Chris Rogers tells me, calling on the phrase 'you wouldn't like him when he's angry' as the basis for Fedir's ability set. But with that extra fire damage he receives, it's just a little too much all at once. He gets knocked down, and the tide of battle quickly goes south.\nIn truth, I played no part in this downfall. Rogers was in the control cockpit for this one, showing me exactly how Harebrained Schemes' latest game actually works. It's quite a different proposition from their last game, Battletech, and in this quite literal trial by fire, studio head and co-founder Mitch Gitelman actually pulled a dollar out of his pocket at one point and put a bet on whether Rogers would make it out alive. He certainly had his work cut out for him. Rogers won that dollar, and here's how the game's emphasis on deep, customisable character builds set him up for success.\nRead more",

Even nuzzled into my chair with a controller in hand, I simply can’t stick to the beat. My eyes glued to notes floating across the screen, trying to hit them at just the right time, you’d probably see Time hiding in a corner to my left, giggling at my repeated failure. A barrage of borked bleeps and bungled notes tend to leave me with spirits sunk.\nIn Hi-Fi Rush, though, I always leave with my head held high.\nRead more",

You have to know enough about enough to be able to write about enough.\nThere are, however, a bunch of big important games that I haven't played. Sometimes it's because a bunch of other people have, so that gap in the site's knowledge is already plugged (and I do always make sure to be aware of their impact and basic facts). Other times, they might be games that I'm not really interested in playing, either because they're not my genre or they seem too overwrought. Or, in some cases, it's because everyone says they're really good and I have to try them, though I've been burned before on this method (you people said the same about Ready Player One).

But he wasn't quite sure what. \"I was in the kitchen talking to my son about, 'Oh, what should I do? I don't know what opportunities there are,' and he was like, 'Why don't you just pick the company you want to work at and ask them?'\" And as a life-long Crusader Kings player, the answer was clear. \"Okay!?\" Humble says incredulously. \"I can do that, I guess. So I did. I wrote to [PR manager] Troy [Goodfellow], and he knew Fred [Wester, CEO], and that was it. It was two weeks later and I met him in San Francisco and said, hey, I'd like to start a studio, and here's the way I'd like to run it. And he was like, sure, let's go for it.\"\nSo began Humble's journey to creating Life By You, his upcoming life simulator that's set to give his former pet project, The Sims, a run for its money. With The Sims 5, or Project Rene as it's currently known, still some way off, Life By You seems poised to finally give life sim fans the game they've always wanted. \"I wanted to make an open world life simulator where the core tenant was freedom,\" says Humble. \"Where players could freely play and tell their stories with minimal friction.\" And what was standing in the way of that freedom? Loading screens, says Humble.\nRead more",

It's a purely military game about overcoming massed defences through attrition, both in localised real-time battles, and a turn-based strategic map.

Liam and I have now both played the demo and you can listen to our impressions in the video below:\nWhat really appealed to us about Pizza Possum is how chaotic it is. It's like Untitled Goose Game but at double the speed. Playing the eponymous possum, you need you scamper around a sunny Mediterranean town scoffing as much food as you can get your grubby mitts on.\nThere's an element of hide-and-seek too, as there are patrol dogs who will try and stop your food eating rampage, but you can quickly jump into a berry bush to thorw them off your scent. It's goofy fun, and we're completeley smitten with it.\n Read more",

Another interesting thing is that Mega Cat reached out to a handful of real-life wrestlers to ask their permission to use their likeness in the game - not an easy feat to secure, I'm sure.\n Read more",

You can watch my impressions of the demo in the video below:\nIn Mythwrecked you play as Alex, a backpacker who has washed up on the sun-drenched shores of Ambrosia Island. As she begins exploring, she soon realises that this island seems to be a hot spot for the gods from ancient Greek myths. Your task is to befriend each god, help them restore their memories, and find a way back to civilisation.\nFrom playing the demo, you can see much of what made Roki fun reflected in Mythwrecked. The environments are interesting to poke around in, puzzles are breezy brain ticklers, and it has Polygon Treehouse's sense of humour. Each Greek god has a humerous twist on their lore,  and during the demo I had a fun time chatting with Hermes, who is dressed in nothing more than a pair of skimpy white speedos and a matching white sweat band - a bold choice of attire.\n Read more",

It doesn't feel cramped at all, even with Friday's busy crowds, and the booths are as spectacular as ever.\nSome of our favourites included Devolver Digital's movie theatre-inspired booth, which has the new addition of a candle-lit shrine for Cult Of The Lamb's upcoming free expansion Relics Of The Old Faith. We also loved Ysbryd Games' Demonschool booth which had a school desk layout and cool retro TV.

Some of the actors won't come out of their trailers. One of them will but if you shoot him from the front you realise he's got no eyes, but don't show the audience that. It's not intentional, he's getting them fixed. Also can you film it twice, for different streaming platforms? Make a really good version for Netflix and a slightly worse looking one for Quibi.”\r\n\n\r\nEvery so often a game trailer comes along that makes me think, hang on, that was bloody brilliant! I bet some people made that! Most recently it was Creative Assembly’s Immortal Empires trailer. Well, I’ve been digging around and I’m happy to report that yes, although I’m the first one to just see a trailer as an algorithm trying to snatch my coin purse away like a manure-encrusted Victorian ne’er-do-well, game trailers are made by humans. They're often humans who do it as as specific job, either in-house at a developer or as an outside agency like Realtime Nordic.

Turns out her hunch was correct - Everywhere is a platform that allows players to create their own custom content. To show off what the tools can do, Benzies and the team unveiled MindsEye, an episodic “blockbuster” adventure available inside Everywhere. A game set inside a game, if you will.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It might be cruel to wrench these awards away so soon after receiving them, but it's all in the name of spreading good vibes and extra shoutouts, I promise.

We first came across Demonschool back at PAX West last year and have loved it ever since. It's a slick, tactical Persona-like where you play as a band of university students navigating school life by day and beating up ghosties and ghoulies by night.\nI had a chat with Demonschool's Jenna Stoeber who talked me through what Demonschool is about, the game's many horror inspirations, and what spooky shinanigans players can expect. If the giant skeleton lad in the game's trailer and demo is anything to go by, we're in for a treat. You can watch the full interview by watching the video below:\n\nIf you've haven't yet, set your peepers on Demonschool's slick trailer to see what demon hunter Faye and her gang of misfits are up against. There's no concrete release date, but like Jenna said, Demonschool should be out sometime in 2023 with a playable demo available in May.\nWe've got plenty more interviews, demos, and highlights lined up for the rest of the week and you can find all our PAX East coverage by checking out our RPS@PAX tag. \n \nRead more",

Whereas Relic's recently released Company Of Heroes 3 will let you pick from its four broad faction types in its WWII RTS battles, Men Of War 2 takes a much more granular view, offering up 14-15 different unit types for each of its three playable nations. That's a dizzying array of infantry, tank and artillery battalions to choose from, and that's before you account for all the individual nuances between its Soviet, USA and German army types. Throw in seven game modes across several different maps, and it's a veritable strategy smorgasbord to stuff your face into. \nCrucially, though, everyone gets access to some sort of tank, which let's face it, is always going to be the MVP of any WW2 strategy game, and probably the sole reason why we're here in the first place. As Men Of War 2 heads into its first open multiplayer tech test on Steam today (running until March 27th), here's my full report of my mildly doomed multiplayer tankventures in its Combat, Front Line and Incursion modes.\nRead more",

There are a lot of terrible things that call the oceans of The Marrows home in this melancholy fishing adventure, but what they are, I couldn't possibly tell you. In all my hours sailing these cursed waters, I've only ever seen brief flashes of them - their ungodly, slippery masses, long spiny fins, and a dozen different combinations of glowing eyes, teeth and tentacles. They're forever fading in and out of view, cloaked by the thick fog that blankets the sea every evening. Sometimes your ship lights will catch them for a split second before they slip away, or maybe you'll only hear them hurtling toward you, with a scream of a jet engine and a maw that's white hot, ready for gnashing your flimsy wooden carcass into sawdust. \nIt's unnerving, being out at sea after dark, but that's the time when the rarest and most vile catches raise their scaly heads. So the question becomes: are you willing to risk your own sanity for the sake of a quick buck? Or are you too afraid of what you'll find in Davy Jones' locker? In Dredge, the answer is always yes. Yes, you will be frightened of what's out there, whether it's real or born from your own fearful imaginings, but you'll sputter out into the darkness regardless, because the allure of this supernatural fishing sim is just too good to resist.\nRead more",

I remember a chill ran down my spine as I cast my mind back to Far Cry 6, where the tutorial island itself was longer than anything else I'd played that year. I was scared Redfall might succumb to a similar fate. I imagined it filling my head with map markers until my head swelled, popped like a balloon, and dropped grey rarity brain matter.\nWell, having given Redfall a go for 90 minutes I was, perhaps, being a bit dramatic. The game may be open world, and may have some slightly jarring open world-isms, but I felt like Arkane's magic wasn't diluted by it all. Their talent for storytelling and level design bubbled to the surface constantly, making exploration a genuine joy. Sure, I have some reservations, but I can't deny that I'm itching to play it again.\nRead more",

Lucky for us, that's not really what we're talking about here, although we do use that as a jumping-off point for our chat.\nInstead, we try to come up with an Indiescovery Manifesto, one that will guide us in the future when we're thinking about what games we ought to cover on the pod. We achieve this through a lively discussion that mainly involves me playing devil's advocate by throwing out ridiculous edge cases until Rachel and Liam want to break down and weep.

So last month, it was pretty big news to hear he was leaving Firaxis behind to chase a “new dream.” At the time, it was unclear what that dream was, but thanks to a podcast interview with My Perfect Console (spotted and transcribed by VGC) we now have an idea of what Solomon will do next. It involves opening a new studio and working on strategy games, unlike the ones he made at Firaxis.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Tchia’s island is a marvel to behold. Not only is it gorgeous, but it’s bursting with things to do: sailing, climbing, totem carving, gliding, pearl diving, sharpshooting, tree hopping, treasure hunting - the list goes on and on. \nNot only that, but there’s a 10-hour story to follow, quests to complete, and baddies to tussle with. It's a lot, but Awaceb seem to take it all in their stride. Never once does Tchia feel like it’s bursting at the seams; its balance of activities, exploration and story make it feel perfectly whole. The game's incredible scope doesn't feel like the debut of a nine-person team, but astonishingly, it is. We've had a good run of Bestest Bests on RPS this month, and I'm more than happy to extend it because Tchia is an absolute triumph.\nRead more",

Ten už v roce 1965 předpověděl, že počet tranzistorů, které mohou být umístěny na integrovaný obvod, se při zachování stejné ceny zhruba každých 18 měsíců zdvojnásobí. Později byl odhad upraven na zdvojnásobení každé dva roky, ale toto pravidlo zůstalo platné po mnoho desetiletí.",

Tactics games are quite popular, as are their often-accompanying social mechanics and life-sim elements. So combining demons and school makes sense.\nBut Demonschool is a lot more than the sum of its parts. It's a sleek, engaging tactics game that gets right to the thick of things.

This event will run from March 31 to April 2, and it will repeat the following weekend from April 7 to April 9.\nOne of the most challenging aspects of 7-Star raids is sheer unpredictability. The moveset of any Pokemon can completely change which monster will counter it best, so it’s almost impossible to prepare for an event before it goes live. For example, Samurott is a Water-Type Pokemon with a Bug Tera Type, which means Flying-Type Pokemon should be the best counters. However, if Samurott knows an Ice-Type move, the best Pokemon may be Walking Wake with Flamethrower or a Skill Link Cloyster with Rock Blast.\nAs unpredictable as r…",

This one, released in late March 2023, involves a \"Boston-themed banner.\" No, it's not a Dunkin Donuts/Ben Affleck promo. But there is a lobster (lobstah?) involved.\nhttps://twitter.com/SplatoonNA/status/1640186892908937217\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNdesjIP2AA&t=7079s\nSaid banner is Boston-themed because of the recent Splatoon 3 tournament sponsored by Nintendo: which was held at PAX East this past weekend in Boston, Massachusetts. Team Starburst beat out team Destiny Bond with a sweep, becoming the winners of the 2023 Splatoon 3 North American Championship. Hey look, it's a free gift! Take it or leave it.\nScan this QR code for the Splatoon 3 Boston reward:\n[caption id=\"attachment_371169\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"512\"] Image via Nintendo[/caption]\nFirst off, you can’t just scan the QR code with your camera app on your phone. You’ll need to go download the Nintendo Switch Online app on either iOS or Android.\nOnce you have the app, load it up, log into your Nintendo Switch Online account, and look for the Splatoon 3 icon at the top. That’s actually “Splatnet 3,” and it’s the app-within-the-app that you’ll need to use to scan the below codes.\nAfter Splatnet 3 loads, scroll to the bottom and look for the “QR Code Reader” icon.\nSelect “use your smartphone’s camera to scan a QR code” to directly scan codes from this article, or select “scan a QR code from a saved image” (you may need to give your app access to your phone’s camera or image collection).\nThat’s it! The code will then redeem and you’ll be able to pick the reward up from the in-game terminal.

          "description": "Who's left?\nMight as well start unpacking your bags; IGN is reporting that Sega and Tencent have confirmed to them that they are going to be skipping E3 2023. At this point, the list of companies not attending outsizes the ones who have confirmed they are.\nWhile the two biggest takeaways from IGN’s article is that Sega and Tencent won’t be on the floor, they also received word that Devolver Digital isn’t attending in any capacity. While the publisher would often set up shop in the parking lot as an unofficial demonstration, this year, they’re not even planning that. There will be a Devolver Direct in June, however.\nIt’s not looking good for E3, which was already facing an uphill battle in re-establishing itself after the COVID pandemic. While video game conventions and shows are still widespread, E3 has long been held as a sort of video game Christmas that all gamers look forward to. Big game and hardware announcements were withheld for this time of year.\nThe expo’s battle for relevancy won’t end this year. IGN reached out to numerous publishers to get a response on whether they’ll be attending and got mostly radio silence. While that doesn’t mean they definitely won’t be there, in a normal year, most companies would have announced their intentions already.\nI have mixed feelings about this, but mainly I’m rooting for E3. It’s been running since I was a kid, and I remember getting excited for it and watching video game news. It’s different now that the internet has changed the speed at which we can hear of new events, so maybe this is the unavoidable future, but I’m going to miss that hype-based burst of dopamine.\nThe post Sega, Tencent, and Devolver announce they will not attend E3 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Time for an upgrade?\nI hope you weren’t too attached to that Aero interface, because Valve has announced that its Steam client will no longer support Windows 7, 8, or 8.1 starting on January 1, 2024.\nIn a support article, Valve states that “The newest features in Steam rely on an embedded version of Google Chrome, which no longer functions on older versions of Windows. In addition, future versions of Steam will require Windows feature and security updates only present in Windows 10 and above.”\nWhile this specifically impacts the Steam client, it also means that you won’t be able to launch games from it. It’s not clear if you can stick with an older version and turn updates off, but Valve is suggesting it’s time to upgrade.\nMaybe that’s true. Personally, I think Windows 7 was a great step up from Windows XP. Everything that followed has been a bigger and bigger mess that I mostly tolerate and hope that nothing breaks. I worked in I.T. during the transition from XP to 7 (we’ll pretend Vista never happened, the business world certainly did). When 8 came along, it was horrible for businesses, and Microsoft basically had to strongarm companies to move off of Windows 7 by ending support for it. Windows 10 isn’t bad, I guess. Windows 11… works.\nIn any case, if you want to keep using Steam, you’ll want to consider letting go of those better days and get back on the Operating System treadmill.

This one focuses on Jun Kazama, as she complains about violence while unloading on her family.\nJun Kazama was featured in Tekken 2 and the non-canon Tag Tournament games. She went missing at the beginning of Tekken 3’s narrative, so her return has been a long time coming. She’s the mother of Jin Kazuma, who she had with Kazuya Mishima.\nShe shows up in some flowing silks which, like the wardrobe of some other characters, seem far too nice to actually fight in. She seems to be some sort of Disney Princess, as nature just loves her, though that might be to highlight her peaceful nature. Despite her disgust with conflict, she’s depicted as showing no hesitation in beating the stuffing out of her son.\nhttps://youtu.be/oLKmcOp_PlM\nWith Jun Kazama, Bandai Namco has given a highlight trailer for all announced characters, including the previous ones: Jin Kazama, Marshall Law, Nina Williams, King, Paul Phoenix, Jack-8, Lars Alexandersson, and Kazuya Mishima. Will they announce others? Maybe. We’re still a year out from its targeted launch window.\nTekken 8 is currently in development for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X.

Pre-order customers were given the opportunity to revisit Sanctuary on the weekend of March 17, while everybody was invited to Hell and back on the weekend of March 24. These betas would offer die-hard fans of the BIG DEEEEEE their first look at the dungeon-crawling epic.\nWell, at least they were if they were able to get through the door... Online games, same old story, y'know?\n\nI, legitimately, put well over 1000 hours into Diablo III.

          "description": "Not Gundam… yet\nCurve Digital has announced that they’re helping assemble Kitbash Model Club, a game by Floating Origin Interactive and helmed by Kerbal Space Program lead developer Felipe Falanghe. Previously known as Balsa Model Flight Simulator, Kitbash Model Club is a game about designing and testing out various types of vehicular models.\nThe trailer that dropped alongside the announcement shows off the various types of models you’ll be making, as well as some of the modes and the design suite. You can definitely see the Kerbal DNA in Kitbash Model Club, as it seems to focus on experimentation. Once you’ve got a built model, you take it out into Wirraway to test them out. While not much is shown in the way of gameplay objectives, it does demonstrate the RC dogfighting, which allows you to “challenge friends.”\nhttps://youtu.be/jU1aYokrbDA\nI’m liking what I see, and I absolutely love Kerbal, but I feel like I need to see more of what I’m actually going to be doing with these models before I can really get excited. Creation for the sake of creation is something I can already do in so many games, so I’m more interested in what these abominations of model design will be doing.\nFortunately, the store page lists a full career with “paintball combat missions, races, and maneuverability challenges.” There’s also going to be a scenario editor where you can create your missions and share them out. Neat.\nKitbash Model Club is initially eying up a PC release and is aiming to be out sometime in 2023.\nThe post Kitbash Model Club is a Kerbal-like game about making models appeared first on Destructoid.",

Are weapons still made of porcelain?\nYes. Yes they are.\nEarly on in the gameplay footage, Link is depicted battling it out with a construct using a tree branch. It doesn’t take long before that branch shifts into a “badly damaged” before breaking entirely.

We have a couple months until release, but anyone looking for a Switch upgrade before then has a tantalizing prospect.\nA special edition Tears of the Kingdom OLED Switch will launch on April 28, 2023. Sporting gold colors that have long been synonymous with the franchise, this is looking like a treat for Zelda collectors. Even the dock sports a vibrant display that will look great when you aren't playing in handheld mode. Remember, the system itself is otherwise identical to the regular OLED Nintendo Switch. If you're not interested in the aesthetics or already own an OLED Switch, this won't do too much for you.\n[caption id=\"attachment_371082\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Nintendo[/caption]\nBut wait, there's more!\nAdditionally, a corresponding Switch Pro Controller and carrying case will be available on May 12, the same date that the game itself will launch. These will run you $74.99 and $24.99 respectively, roughly $5 more than each peripheral's standard counterparts. Again, for Zelda fans and collectors, these are perfectly fair deals. I can't tell anyone else if a couple Triforces are worth $10, but I also buy video games I never actually play, so I'm not a reliable source for monetary advice.\nEven if a Tears of the Kingdom OLED Switch is no surprise, it's nice to see it officially announced. Nintendo says the special edition system and accompanying accessories are available to pre-order (potentially today), but no listings seem to be up following the broadcast. Keep your eyes peeled if these interest you, as other Tears of the Kingdom collectibles have already sold out at many retailers.\nThe post Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom gets a special edition OLED in April appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's been a great source of, well, amiibo news (!) since the account was created, and one of the few places carrying on the legacy of amiibo chasing. While Wave 4 was basically it for a lot of the community, Nintendo has persevered in pushing more plastic, and people are still buying them (albeit with less of a hassle). The newest bit of info they have for us is a potential Zelda amiibo restock, as evidenced by a relisting for the elusive Majora's Mask figure.\nThe eagle-eyed account spotted a Majora's Mask amiibo relisting on Best Buy, which typically coincides with a restock of that same line. Restocks recently came in for the Mario amiibo line, just in time for Mar10 Day. Given the excitement behind Tears of the Kingdom and the amiibo accompanying it, we could see a repeat of that same situation.\nWhat other Legend of Zelda amiibo could see restocks in 2023?\nWell, look no further than this official tweet from Nintendo! In addition to the aforementioned Majora's Mask amiibo, we also have potential restocks on the way for:\nLink (Rider - Breath of the Wild)\nZelda & Loftwing (Skyward Sword)\nAll three of those figures have directly confirmed functionality with Tears of the Kingdom, and will provide extra paraglider skins. More features could be revealed as we get closer to launch, but for now, those seem like a safe bet. Also, I'm sure a lot of collectors will be happy to see more Zelda anything out and about, as a few of these figures were hard to get.\nUpdate (March 28, 2023): The restocks are here!\nSeveral Zelda amiibo are available to buy at GameStop, as well as Best Buy. Note that the Twilight Princess amiibo seems like a GameStop exclusive for this restock.\nThe post Zelda amiibo restocks coincide with the upcoming Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom launch appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's what Capcom is dubbing the \"flickering lights issue in the PS5 version,\" which gets the entire point across in just a few words.

          "description": "Another territory down\nThe Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) has offered its official approval to Microsoft for its proposed purchase of publisher Activision Blizzard. The approval puts Microsoft one step closer to completing the $68.7 billion USD sale, which was first announced in January 2022.\nThe JFTC published its findings yesterday in a 48-page report, wherein the regulatory body states that the proposed purchase \"would not substantially restrain competition in any particular fields of trade.\" The JFTC believes that the merger does not violate antitrust laws, and that the increased trend toward cloud and digital gaming prevents the possibility of any supply shortage of the products themselves.\nThe report will come as a great relief to Microsoft, crossing off one more major distribution territory from the list of areas with which the publisher seeks approval. Of course, Microsoft is yet to gain official approval from two of the biggest markets in the western world: Europe and the United States. The latter is going to be a particularly tough ask, given that the North American FTC has actually filed suit in a bid to block the proposed sale from taking place.\nJapan's approval is a huge feather in the cap of the sale, and could potentially lead to smaller territories — still on the fence about the sale — leaning in Microsoft's favor. Regardless, MS will still have to engage in a legal dispute with the FTC this summer, with both parties able to appeal should the courts not find their favor.

Except I’ve learned that the valleys aren’t always that deep. You can usually, at least, see the peeks from games like Castlevania Judgement and Castlevania 64. I’ve yet to find a Castlevania title without some merit, even if there are a few that don’t exactly crack my whip. I honestly think that 2010’s Castlevania: Lords of Shadow might be the nadir for me, because I found it to be just so stiflingly boring. I don’t even want to know what the sequel is like.\nCastlevania Legends is one that I’ve heard excluded at best and derided at worst.

          "description": "You be changing your mind\nVGC is reporting that Ubisoft has decided to back out of E3's attempted return in 2023. This comes a month after they claimed they were finalizing their plans to attend the expo. I suppose those plans are now finalized as being \"nope.\"\nSpeaking to VGC, a spokesperson reportedly said, \"While we initially intended to have an official E3 presence, we’ve made the subsequent decision to move in a different direction, and will be holding a Ubisoft Forward Live event on 12th June in Los Angeles. We look forward to sharing more details with our players very soon.\"\nThis is disappointing news for anyone who was hoping E3 would return in full form this year after a three-year physical hiatus due to the coronavirus pandemic. Sony and Nintendo have both stated they'll be passing on the expo, with Microsoft holding a separate event elsewhere in LA.\nWhile those are hardly the only big companies in the industry today, E3 was once an event that publishers would be crazy to miss. It was the biggest event of the year, and while it's still an important time for announcements, the biggest companies in the business are progressively moving further and further away from it. It seems like the only way it would ever return to form would be if these publishers were lured into the convention center with the promise of cake and locked the doors behind them.\nThere's still something of a question mark above who's still going to be attending the Electronic Entertainment Expo, with show organizer Reedpop simply saying that \"AAA companies, in addition to indie darlings and tech and hardware firms,\" will be in attendance.\nE3 will be running this year from June 13 through 16 in Los Angeles. You can find the whole tentative schedule right over here.\nThe post Oh, it looks like Ubisoft won’t be attending E3 2023 after all appeared first on Destructoid.",

Guiding an A.I. mech, (or \"Cradle Coffin\"), through the poisonous terrain, players must fight off not only predatory creatures, but also other human players, in a race to bring home the lion's share of precious \"AO crystals\".\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzwpalvyRas&ab_channel=EMOTIONLabelChannel\nA Synduality anime, exploring the lore of the world and its characters, is also in the works. This project has been newly rechristened Synduality: Noir and is expected to premiere in July of this year. A new trailer, which you can check out above, features new footage from the animated series. The video is soundtracked by the anime's theme song \"Raytracer\", as performed by artist Stereo Dive Foundation.\nSynduality will launch on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X later in 2023.\nThe post Mech adventure Synduality is now Synduality: Echo of Ada appeared first on Destructoid.",

If that's the case, this news certainly doesn’t bode well for the fate of what’s supposed to be E3’s big return. \nAs for what Ubisoft could show at its event, Assassin’s Creed Mirage, The Crew Motorfest, and (maybe) Skull and Bones are slated to release this year. Other announced projects include the long-quiet Splinter Cell and Prince of Persia remakes, a multitude of new Assassin’s Creed games, and Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. A rumored follow-up to Immortals Fenyx Rising could also make an appearance.  \nUbisoft joins Nintendo on the list of major publishers that have declined to participate in this year’s show, following a previous report that Microsoft and Sony plan to follow suit. E3 is largely organized by ReedPop this year and will take place June 13-16 at the Los Angeles Convention Center.

          "description": "A video game based on the hit Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles graphic novel The Last Ronin is in the works, Polygon reports.\nThe news comes from Polygon's interview with Doug Rosen, senior vice president for games and emerging media at Paramount Global. According to Rosen, The Last Ronin video game will be a single-player action role-playing title in the vein of the Norse-themed God of War series. Like the story it adapts, the game will feature a mature tone. The game’s developer has not been named, and the project is years away from release. \nThe Last Ronin was published in 2020 as a five-issue mini-series by IDW. It takes place in a dark futuristic New York, where three of the four turtles have been killed. The surviving turtle, whose identity is revealed at the end of the first issue (we won’t spoil it), dons a black mask and seeks revenge by fighting crime using both his and the weapons of his fallen brothers. \nIt’s a cool (and very grim) story if you haven’t read it, and we’re excited to see it translated into a game. Rosen also mentions in the same interview that Paramount sees opportunities to create different types of TMNT games that target young and adult audiences. \nThe Turtles are enjoying quite the renaissance lately thanks to the launch of the well-received beat ‘em up Shredder’s Revenge last year, the nostalgia trip of the Cowabunga Collection, a Shredder-themed Call of Duty pack, and even a new animated film coming to theaters this August.  \n[Source: Polygon]",

Despite some shortcomings, the compilation remains the best official way to experience those classic games from Genesis and Sega CD three decades following their original releases. Today, Sega announced the bundle is about to get better through Sonic Origins Plus, a premium upgrade that arrives a year after the collection's initial launch.\nSonic Origins Plus brings forward all the features of Sonic Origins delivered last year – Classic Mode, Anniversary Mode, widescreen support, added story animations, a virtual museum, and more – while adding a bunch of new content. First up, Sonic Origins Plus adds all 12 Sonic Game Gear games to the museum.\nThe full list of Game Gear games getting added is listed below.\nDr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine\nSonic Blast\nSonic Chaos\nSonic Drift\nSonic Drift 2\nSonic Labyrinth\nSonic Spinball\nSonic the Hedgehog\nSonic the Hedgehog 2\nSonic the Hedgehog Triple Trouble\nTails Adventure\nTails' Sky Patrol\nOn top of that, Amy joins the roster of playable characters in the Genesis and Sega CD titles (Sonic 1, Sonic 2, Sonic 3 & Knuckles, and Sonic CD). One of the strangest exclusions in the original Sonic Origins release is also rectified, as Knuckles will become playable in Sonic CD. Sadly, this first press release does not make any mention of restoring the replaced music in Sonic the Hedgehog 3.\n\n\nSonic Origins Plus arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on June 23. If you don't already own the initial release of Sonic Origins, the digital version of Sonic Origins Plus costs $40. The physical version, which includes a 20-page artbook and reversible coversheet with new art, also costs $40. If you already own Sonic Origins, you can upgrade to Plus for $10.

          "description": "Arkane was developing a PlayStation 5 version of its upcoming first-person vampire shooter, Redfall, before Microsoft acquired Bethesda in 2020. However, following the acquisition, the PS5 version of the game was canceled by Microsoft, according to Arkane director Harvey Smith in an interview with IGN France (translated by IGN). \nDiscussing this with IGN France, Smith said, \"We got bought by Microsoft and that was a huge sea change. They said, 'No PlayStation 5. Now we're gonna do Game Pass, Xbox and PC.'\"\n\n\nSmith said Arkane didn't mind the decision, even if Redfall was originally meant to release on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. \n\"Support from Game Pass and having to worry about one less platform, one less complexity,\" Smith told IGN France. \"And Game Pass has a ton of people that can play. It could be our biggest game ever because of the 30 million Game Pass [members] or whatever that number is.\" \nNews of this canceled PS5 version of Redfall doesn't come as much of a surprise. When Redfall was revealed during a 2021 Xbox and Bethesda E3 showcase, it was revealed as an Xbox console exclusive. And considering it's par for the course for companies like PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo to keep their first-party releases off of competitor consoles, it's also not surprising Microsoft opted to make Redfall an Xbox exclusive after it acquired Bethesda. \nA spokesperson for Microsoft responded to this story, providing the following statement: \nRedfall hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC on May 2. \nFor more about the game, watch the latest Redfall story trailer that introduces some of the vampiric big bass and then watch this gameplay trailer that invites you out to a bloody night on the town. \n[Source: IGN France via IGN]\nAre you excited for Redfall?

We got another look at the game's grisly world in a new trailer released during The Game Awards back in December, and now, thanks to Epic's State of Unreal presentation today, we get to see more of the game. \nBecause it's a trailer released as part of today's State of Unreal presentation, it's less cinematic than previous trailers and instead, focuses on some of the visual design work going into the game.\nCheck it out for yourself below in this new trailer for The Lords of the Fallen:  \n\n\nAs you can see, The Lords of the Fallen continues to look great, and fortunately, we don't have to wait too much longer to go hands-on with it because it's due out on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC sometime this year. \nFor more information about the game, head to our hub for The Lords of the Fallen and then read our thoughts on its predecessor in Game Informer's Lords of the Fallen review after that. \nAre you excited for The Lords of the Fallen?

This beta will feature Crash Bandicoot, Coco Bandicoot, Tawna Bandicoot, Doctor Neo Cortex, and Dingodile. \n\n\nThe game will cost $29.99 but a deluxe edition for $39.99 will also be available. Crash Team Rumble will also include a battle pass and both editions include the first season's pass. The deluxe edition will also include the Season 2 battle pass, a free 25-tier boost for Season 1, and the digital proto pack, which brings \"Blocky\" skins to the game alongside some equippable items, according to VGC. \nPreviews released today mention three different roles in Crash Team Rumble: Booster, Blocker, and Scorer. Using these three roles in a MOBA-like fashion, players will need to collect as much Wumpa Fruit as possible and bring it to their zone. If you've played 2021's Pokemon Unite, you probably get the gist here. \n\nCrash Team Rumble will feature crossplay. It is being developed by Toys for Bob, the team that developed the Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy collection and Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time. \nWhile waiting for Crash Team Rumble to release in June, read Game Informer's Crash Bandicoot N.

As for the type of game, Snyder says it will be an RPG and apparently, it will have a \"ridiculous scale.\" \n\"The one thing that I'm having a really good time with – and I don't really know if I'm supposed to talk about it – is this RPG that we're doing that is just literally insane, and so immersive and so intense and so huge,\" he said on the podcast, according to VGC. \"There's more coming, but all I'll say is that it was pitched to me – because I've always wanted to do an RPG – like, 'well, we could do it at this scale, or we could do it at ridiculous scale.'\n\"And I was like, 'ridiculous scale is clearly the scale that we should be doing it.'\"\nSnyder says the team behind the RPG said, \"Well, it's going to take so much time, we've got to do all these brain dumps, you've got to tell us everything in the universe, what's happening, the science.\" And Snyder said he was happy to do that, telling them, \"Let's go all the way.\" \nSnyder wrote and directed Rebel Moon and it hits Netflix this December. \nIn the meantime, read about how Netflix is developing its own series based on video games, like this live-action Assassin's Creed show and this animated Gears of Wars series (alongside a live-action Gears of War film, too). \n[Source: The Nerd Queens via Video Games Chronicle]\nAre you interested in playing a Rebel Moon RPG?

His movie credits include the \"John Wick\" franchise (he was promoting the latest, \"John Wick 4,\" which hits theaters soon, just this week), \"Godzilla Vs.

Following in the footsteps of actress Kathy Bates, Pascal has recently appeared in a series of promotional shorts for a mobile game called Merge Mansion, and Game Informer can exclusively reveal the latest installment. Check it out below:\n\n\nIn this series, Pascal plays a detective named Tim Rockford, who's trying to figure out what exactly is going on with the mysterious grandma in Merge Mansion. It's an enigma so elusive that he never even says exactly what he is he's investigating, though from the collection of knives he has in his evidence room, it seems an act of violence was committed.\nIn a press release, Pascal had the following to say about this role.\nWhat exactly is Tim Rockford investigating? What is grandma putting in her pies? Will Pedro Pascal become a playable character in-game?

Your tiny light will grow, picking up new abilities and increasing in size, before eventually evolving into a pseudo-mystical entity imbued with vivid powers. \n\"Meanwhile, you'll get a glimpse at the mysteries of the surrounding world, whether through other strayed lights like yourself, or different creatures entirely. The game is set to an atmospheric soundtrack that reflects states of feeling in creatures you encounter, by Grammy-award-winning composer Austin Wintory – whose previous projects include Journey, Abzu, and The Banner Saga Series.\" \nAs for the new Steam demo, Embers calls it a \"limited time\" experience so if you're interested in checking the game out, do it as soon as you can because there's no word on when the demo will no longer be available. \n\n\"We are thrilled to be able to share our new gameplay trailer and demo with fans of Strayed Lights,\" Embers co-founder and creative director Alexandre Arramon writes in a press release. \"We've been working hard to create a game that is both engaging and visually outstanding, and we can't wait for players to experience it for themselves.\" \nStrayed Lights hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on April 25. \nAre you going to check out the Strayed Lights demo?

          "description": "Last November, Game Freak released Pokémon Scarlet and Violet on Switch. The game quickly became one of the top-selling games in the history of the popular console, and now, it's time for the new generation to kick off within the popular Pokémon Trading Card Game. The inaugural Pokémon Scarlet & Violet expansion does more than just introduce the ninth generation of Pokémon into the TCG; it also implements a whole host of changes, not the least of which is a higher price tag for most items. \nHowever, along with that price increase come several benefits, including a new guarantee of three foil cards in every booster pack, plus the introduction of the silver border in the U.S. and other quality-of-life improvements with regards to the designs. The Pokémon Company sent over several booster packs for us to crack open and see what we could pull. While I was less frequently blown away by the big cards I pulled, this is one of the most robust galleries of \"the coolest cards\" articles I've done in a great many expansions. Partially, that is due to me enjoying seeing some of the newer Pokémon from Gen IX getting their first cards, but I can't help but think the increase in foil cards was to thank.\nIn total, the Pokémon Scarlet & Violet expansion introduces more than 190 new cards, including more than 10 new Pokémon ex cards, more than 30 Trainer cards, new Tera Pokémon, and tons of special-illustration Pokémon and Trainer cards. You can see the coolest cards we pulled from this expansion in the gallery below:\n\n Pokémon Trading Card Game: Scarlet & Violet is available starting on March 31.

The developer made the announcement on its Kickstarter page, writing, \n“Since the very beginning, we were secretly hoping to be able to cover all current and previous generation consoles.

In the game, players will control a band of toads looking for a place to call home in the swamps of the deep south. However, in order to protect your settlement, you'll need to fend off the evil Baron Samedi. Along the way, you'll grow your toad family, create more powerful decks, build a settlement, and more across each run. \nCheck out the action for yourself in the Toads of the Bayou teaser trailer below: \n\n\n\"Toads of the Bayou is about combining southern gothic spookiness and the sweet taste of cartoon memories into our own take on the turn-based tactical genre,\" La Grange game designer Alexandre Clement writes in a press release. \"The goal for us was to allow the player to establish their place in this cursed environment and make them appreciate how hard they fought and what they stood for. Nothing is ever granted in the Bayou, and thriving against the Baron's evil forces is a real achievement.\" \nToads of the Bayou will hit Early Access via Steam on PC sometime in 2024. \nAre you interested in Toads of the Bayou?

          "description": "The first two installments of Syberia are now ready for testing in ScummVM!\nThe acclaimed series from Benoît Sokal follows Kate Walker, a lawyer from New York as she initially tries to complete the sale of the Voralberg toy factory.
