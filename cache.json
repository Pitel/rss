Grezzo's 2019 Switch release The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening requires close to the same amount of space.

Apparently some Steam Deck players are seeing an \"Innapropriate activity detected\" message upon launching Elden Ring, blocking them from playing online. I haven't had this myself, and some have reported the issue fixing itself after they installed the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, but hopefully there's a proper patch in the works.\nElden Ring on the Steam Deck has long enjoyed a smoothness that desktop play has lacked. Not so much in simple framerate terms – the handheld spends far more time around the 30fps mark than it does bumping into Elden Ring’s 60fps cap – but thanks to a Proton compatibility update back in 2022, it’s drastically less prone to the flow-breaking stutter that still plagues the RPG in 2024. That now goes for Shadow Of The Erdtree as well, judging from my portable time in the new expansion.\nRead more",

It's also, according to several former employees of Chorus developers Fishlabs in Hamburg, an internal title for the massive cost-cutting project begun by Swedish conglomerate Embracer Group in June 2023.\nThe current incarnation of a bewildering series of mergers, renamings and acquisitions that date back to the founding of Nordic Games in 2004, Embracer have spent much of the past decade buying up video game studios and licenses, from Deus Ex developers Eidos Montreal to the adaptation rights for The Lords Of The Rings. According to a February 2023 earnings report, by the end of December 2022 the conglomerate had 134 internal studios on the books (including table-top developers) and owned or controlled over 850 IPs, with 224 games in development. Our Graham warned of the perils of such consolidation in 2019, and his misgivings have been borne out. Following the reported collapse of a billion dollar Savvy Games investment deal, Embracer set out to recover their debts by cancelling projects, laying off staff and closing whole studios. Fishlabs - acquired by Embracer in 2018 alongside their parent company Koch Media, nowadays Plaion - were among those burned by \"Project Phoenix\", first losing a dozen people in September 2023, and then around half their remaining workforce in November. In the process of these reductions, Embracer also binned off two video game projects – a sumptuous sci-fi metroidvania that was in full development, and a \"visual prototype\" for a brand new Red Faction game.\n  \nRead more",

Early footage painted the portrait of a spirited 3D hack-and-slasher featuring much buckling of swashes, heaving of hos and jollying of rogers.\nJim Rossignol (RPS in peace) was cautiously enthused when he played Captain Blood in 2008. \"It was actually pretty fun - especially the arcade boat violence between speedy galleons - but I'm not exactly holding out for a masterpiece,\" he wrote. Alas, Captain Blood's ship struck a reef in the shape of unspecified publishing disputes, and sank beneath the waves after one last defiant preview showing in 2010. Now, the game has risen from the depths Flying Dutchman-style thanks to new developers Seawolf Studio and General Arcade and publisher SNEG Ltd.

If the number goes up enough, the game drops additional pictures of bananas into your Steam inventory. Actually, it's not even an idle clicker - simply leaving the game open all day is enough to generate a slow but steady supply of these banana pictures. \r\n \nRead more",

But Nine Sols is so generous, so creative, so lucid and upfront in its ruleset, even as it crushes you with sometimes absurd difficulty, that playing it has opened up an entire library of classics I might have otherwise missed out on. I don’t have the experience to tell you what this game does better than others of its ilk, but I can tell how it made me feel.

And every \"yersel\" sneering out of the machismo-ridden workers became \"yourself\". Well, turns out that's the result of the game defaulting to \"International English\" for its captions.

          "description": "Battle Aces is billed as “a vision of the future for real-time strategy” but if you glance at a screen, you might think you’re staring into the past: another toonified science fiction world of scuffed, shiny nodules, lanes and arenas, an overly functional colour scheme, and hotkeyed hordes of little and large units that appear devoid of personality, even by top-down generalissimo standards. Let’s start by addressing that last complaint: the units of Battle Aces have immense personality. It just doesn’t come across well in screens.\nEach is a mix of bug and robot, with a clutch of finely observed, quirky-but-never-gratuitous animations that immediately had me choosing favourites when I played the game at Summer Game Fest. \"Our main unit design concept artist, his father was also an illustrator and nature illustrator at that, so he's already accomplished with animal designs, but he also loves mechs and robots too,\" notes Uncapped Games art director Ted Park. \"So he's kind of melded both worlds as much as he can.\"\r\n \nRead more",

It isn't realism for its own sake (look no further than the automated vehicles and the ludicrous citizen behaviour to refute that), but a fundamentally different interpretation of what city building means. It's about co-ordinating all your pieces so they'll be in the right place to support each other, and how the whole is all that matters, but that whole will fail if you don't organise its parts.

He asked whether I thought it was big enough to consider the DLC a pseudo-sequel, and at the time I said something along the lines of, \"It's hefty, but I think that's probably pushing it\".\nI was wrong. The Land Of Shadow may not be as expansive as the base game's Lands Between, but it's knottier, denser, more of a twisting mass that burrows into the earth and soars into the skies. For this reason I think it produces some of Elden Ring's finest moments, as exploration leads to a truer sense of discovery reminiscent of old Souls. But I also think its sheer density exposes more chinks in its open world format, where its interconnected sprawl leads to even greater recollection paralysis.\nRead more",

I'd save up to buy one of the premium headliners, attempt to get my money's worth inside a week, then swap it for a respected double-A and perhaps a sub-£8 oddity with the manual missing - nesting one purchase within the other like a series of Matryoshka dolls.\nThis was my Big Short, my Moneyball. But it had a drawback: often, I was so eager to leapfrog to another game before the trade-in price changed that I skimmed RPGs that are now considered classics. The big one was Suikoden 2, which I spent only an evening with before gambling that I'd eke more FunValue out of a game with a less traditional battle system. I can't remember what I traded that for, which says it all. Another was Baten Kaitos on Gamecube, which - yes, we are finally getting to the point here - has just been rereleased on Steam in the shape of a Baten Kaitos I & II HD Remaster.

          "description": "Scottish petrochemical horror is not exactly a genre, but maybe it ought to be. From the opening moments of Still Wakes The Deep you know life on its 1970s North Sea oil rig is precarious. Leaky ceilings, busted panelling, faulty drill machinery - the omens pile up as you spend your first thirty minutes wandering through the colleague-packed canteen and over the platform into the boss' office for a severe dressing-down. It's a classic pre-disaster setup for a mostly traditional monster story, yet the game sticks expertly to the first-person horror form, and its voice actors' performances are so spot-on, that it'd feel churlish to judge this foaming fear simulator for sticking to type. It also has some markedly unsettling use of the shipping forecast, a famously dull feature of British radio I definitely did not expect to freak me out in a video game.\nRead more",

          "description": "\"Two's company, three's a crowd,\" the saying goes, unless the first two are warriors and the third one is a priest, in which case the superior proverb is surely \"three's a moderately balanced squad, two's a massive liability\"? Here to put such kitchen wisdom to the test is BioWare's Dragon Age: The Veilguard, which \"only\" allows you to bring two companions into the fray, one fewer than 2014's Dragon Age: Inquisition. It's another indication that this will be more biffy action game than thinky party-based RPG. The upside, assuming you find that last sentence disappointing, is that exploration and combat will be more \"intimate\", and individual characters will have more screentime to bounce off each other and flourish as personalities. All this comes care of a BioWare Discord Q&A from late last week, which you can watch in full below.\n Read more",

I had a go at this year's Keighleycon, and it's one of two games at the show I wanted to carry on playing once my time was up.

Now, PC Gamer’s Ted Litchfield has spoken to 12 current and former employees about the circumstances surrounding the cancellation, notably the details of the layoffs, the expansion, and the “humiliation campaign” suffered by writer Argo Tuulik  as apparent retaliation for his participation in last year’s extensive People Make Games documentary.

But this does open them up to players who shy away from Epic's storefront. I use the term \"open up\" loosely, because Kingdom Hearts is popularly regarded as a tangle of criss-crossing JRPG confuse-o-plots that require diagrams and multiple explainer videos to follow. I don't know if that's true, having never followed Alice down this Buster Sword-shaped rabbit hole, but it is the popular joke. And, looking into Goofy's cold, dead eyes, I find I am afraid to question it.\nRead more",

I’ll need to clean my keyboard soon. I keep taking screenshots of Felvidek. I can’t take enough. I want to make a scrapbook of every character and every line. Neither my laundry nor keyboard will ever be clean forever either, but if I hate Felvidek for emphasising that, I love it for reminding me that all the best art is buttressed by an irremovable layer of deep, thick grime.\n \nRead more",

Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector is a sci-fi RPG with plenty of dice and a heavy nod towards tabletop role-playing. The first Citizen Sleeper saw your bio-robotic protagonist landing on a donut-shaped space station where they learned to make a new life for themselves among interstellar farmers and ramen-serving rapscallions. In the sequel, a demo of which I've played [smug face], the hook is a little different. This time you're being pursued across a bunch of backwater truck stops, colonies, depots, and derelicts. All the while your misfit crew will clash and commingle. You still haven't got it, have you? Ugh. I suppose I'll let the game's designer tell you then.\nRead more",

Short stages that dole out chunky progression hits of dopamine, as quickly as they wrest those hits away from you with another humbling beatdown.

          "description": "Slay the Princess was one of the biggest indie surprises of 2023, and its Steam player count has since exploded past the stratosphere after popular YouTuber Markiplier began a playthrough video series on June 22. To help the climb of Slay the Princess, developers at Black Tabby Games launched a Steam promo campaign that shaved off 20% of the game's price, then did players one even better.\n\n\nIn a series of since-deleted tweets originally caught by PCGamesN, Black Tabby Games' official Twitter account addressed the people getting into the game through Markiplier's video series. Black Tabby talked about the game's high reactiveness to the player's choices, the game's key aspect that will make every single playthrough a unique experience. Thus, the developers recommend you play the game on your own first — even if you have to resort to piracy, in case they can't afford the game. They concluded by saying you can always buy a copy of the game later. \n\n\n\n\nImage via BlackTabbyGames\n\n\nWhile we don't know the reason behind the decision to delete the Tweets, this remains an act of extreme good faith, one that will likely result in Slay The Princess receiving even more goodwill from the gaming community at large.\n\n\nAnd now that the real-life conundrum some players were facing has been solved, now they only have to deal with the in-game conundrum of slaying the princess or dealing with the dire consequences.\n\n\nYou can get Slay The Princess for PC on Steam for $14.39 until the promotion ends on June 24, though it's likely to go back down when the Steam Summer sale begins on June 27. You can also play it on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and you can get the free demo right here.\n\nThe post Slay the Princess dev tells players to pirate the game instead of just watching playthroughs appeared first on Destructoid.",

Though Echoes and future Episodes promise to continue the game's narrative, the campaign in The Final Shape essentially served as the franchise's Avengers: Endgame, wrapping up a decade-long intrigue. And while the campaign for The Final Shape has proven itself great, I can't shake the feeling that Bungie missed an opportunity to leave an even more significant impact than it did.\n\n\nBig themes throughout The Final Shape are redemption, death, and rebirth. Every character involved experiences one or several of these motifs, whether it's Ikora Rey coming to terms with Cayde-6's return or Crow finally accepting his spot as the Hunter Vanguard.

          "description": "KinnikuNeko: SUPER MUSCLE CAT  is a side-scroller that lives up to its beefy subtitle, starring a character who looks like someone slapped a cat's head on a Cho Aniki screenshot. Following up on its March 2024 launch on Steam, developer Kamotachi's absurd action game is now on the way to consoles.\n\n\nThere's no date in place at the moment, but KinnikuNeko is currently eyeing a release on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch. Kamotachi promises \"many improvements and features,\" and the console release will coincide with a \"great update\" for the Steam version. \n\n\n\n\nWe'll have to wait and see what all those improvements and features stack up to be. In the meantime, you can try it out for yourself on Steam, which has a demo available to download for free. The full game is priced at $11.99 and has garnered \"Very Positive\" reviews since its March debut.\n\n\nThe premise of KinnikuNeko is about what you might expect after looking at a screenshot or two. The titular KinnikuNeko is very accurately described as \"a cat with the body of a bodybuilder,\" and it's up to him and his friends Lemon and Keita to stop a massive alien invasion of Earth. Naturally, KinnikuNeko will be using his absolutely explosive muscles to put the diabolical plans of General Pitaya and her henchmen to rest.\n\n\nHonestly, all you really need to know is \"cartoon cat have beefy body\" and you're most of the way there. The wait for the console versions should give us plenty of time to get our own bodies in shape ahead of the alien onslaught. \n\nThe post KinnikuNeko: SUPER MUSCLE CAT flexes its way to consoles appeared first on Destructoid.",

After the update, players will not only have a new realm and quests with Mulan and Mushu, as well as the brand new Majesty and Magnolias Star Path event, but also a new time-limited event too.\n\n\nThe Inside Out 2 themed event, Memory Mania, will be available as soon as the update goes live on June 26 and will run until July 17, giving players three weeks to complete daily requirements and unlock exclusive event rewards. \n\n\n\n\nThe rewards for this event will be companions inspired by characters from Inside Out 2, including what is likely a very anxious squirrel who reminds me of Bucky from The Emperor’s New Groove, and a turtle in a hoodie who seems to be inspired by Embarrassment in Inside Out 2. \n\n\nImages via Gameloft\n\n\nIn order to get these rewards, as well as any others associated with the Memory Mania event, players will need to find event items which will spawn daily in order to complete memories. Once these memories are completed, you’ll be able to obtain the rewards. \n\n\nWhile it’s nice that players will have plenty to do when the Lucky Dragon update drops, there are some players (myself included) who feel that time-limited events would benefit players more if they took place during downtime. With everything coming all at once, it can feel slightly overwhelming and players can be left feeling as though their attention is split in too many directions. \n\n\nHopefully the requirements for Memory Mania will be quick to complete each day, leaving plenty of time free to grind away at the Majesty and Magnolias Star Path event, or otherwise build friendships with Mulan and Mushu.\n\nThe post Memory Mania event and new companions coming to Disney Dreamlight Valley with Lucky Dragon update appeared first on Destructoid.",

The title arrived as an Apple Arcade exclusive in 2021 and currently holds an 80 out of 100 on reviews aggregate site Metacritic. It also won the award for Mobile game of the Year at the 25th Annual DICE Awards.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Mistwalker was founded in 2004 by Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi, who produced Fantasian. The studio frequently collaborates with longtime Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu, who also worked on Fantasian as the composer. To date, Mistwalker has released multiple critically acclaimed games, including Blue Dragon, Lost Odyssey, and The Last Story.</p>\n\n<p>Fantasian uses similar turn-based design conventions as were found in many of the most classic Final Fantasy games. The title also implements several quality-of-life modernizations, such as the ability to skip random encounters with enemy types you've already defeated until they choose to fight them all at once. Despite being a mobile title, Fantasian's ties to Apple Arcade means it does not include any microtransactions or paid DLC.</p>\n\n<p>Fantasian Neo Dimension arrives on Nintendo Switch this holiday season.</p>",

However, on the surface, it has little to do with the original game created by Howard Scott Warshaw. After all, one is a 2D space shooter while another is a modernized sci-fi Metroidvania. However, with homages to Atari and gaming's past galore, all developed by a renowned studio like WayForward, this release could be one to look forward to when it arrives on its newly announced September release date.</p>\n\n<p>Taking control of a hacker named Emi (codename Yar), players must blast, hack, and sneak their way through various areas. As she progresses, she unlocks new powers that allow her to take out enemies more easily and, in true Metroidvania fashion, access new areas. Yars Rising is published by Atari and pays homage to the company's past, including bosses and minigames that borrow gameplay elements from classic Atari titles.</p>\n\n<p>Though the game is coming to a broader array of platforms, PlayStation 5 and Switch players can pick up physical editions of the game. We recently had a chance to go hands-on with Yars Rising and included our impressions in our list of the coolest things we saw at Summer Game Fest. To read that entry and see the rest of the list, head <a data-entity-substitution=\"canonical\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"876adf32-d734-4ecc-a6ff-6656f84dde7b\" href=\"https://www.gameinformer.com/sgf-2024/2024/06/09/the-coolest-games-we-played-at-summer-game-fest-2024-and-more\">here</a>.

No, it’s not the key on your keyboard. Rather, it’s a detective story set on a distant planet. Important data has been stolen, and the perpetrator is a shape-shifter laying low in a spaceport dive bar until he can flee off-planet. You play a hard-boiled detective who has the skill to psychically visit bar patrons’ memories to gather clues and narrow down suspects.\nThis is thanks to the kind people at ZOOM Platform, who provided us with the original game sources to work with. Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game features a lot of options to chat around with bar patrons’ and do various actions in the different flashbacks. So we really need people to spend time experimenting and make sure everything works correctly. And please take some screenshots along the way.\nIf you don’t own The Space Bar, you can try one of the free demos or purchase it digitally from the ZOOM Platform. Testing is also available on Steam via a beta branch, check the Steam announcement for more details.\nNow, good luck, and fingers crossed you can find the perp. Otherwise, your bureau chief will have you getting up close and personal with toilet duties for the rest of your career. Oh, and PS: The viewpoints of different aliens differ. For the Bartender, who has segmented eyes, even the original developers felt it was difficult and left in a cheat key of ScrollLock to switch back to a single viewpoint. Feel free to use it if, at any point, the flashback becomes too much for you :)\n>",
