          "description": "Late bloomer.\nIn the first year of the Switch’s life, it was relatively common to see massive indie success stories from developers who managed to get their game on the eShop before the veritable torrent of new game releases — many of them excellent — flooded the store on a weekly basis. One of these titles was Blossom Tales, a cute action game that wasn’t even remotely shy about how heavily it was cribbing from the playbook of The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. After the enormous and unexpected success of Blossom Tales saved the development team from having to shut down, work began on Blossom Tales 2, and we’re happy to report that this sophomore effort is every bit as enjoyable as the original — although it’s also just as derivative.\nHere the narrative once again takes place as a ‘story within a story’, as an elderly man tells his two eager grandchildren a tale that features both of them as characters, with Lily, a brave warrior, living with her obnoxious brother in a fantasy land. The two start out participating in all sorts of fun at a nearby fair, but a petty sibling squabble causes Lily to wish that the evil Minotaur King would come and take her brother somewhere far away. Somehow, this causes the real Minotaur King to show up and do just that, which kicks off her quest across the land to reclaim her brother and defeat the evil king.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Your reputation precedes you: before the accused can even sit down, they call out your unusual ability to hack into the minds of people to ‘patch’ their flaws, turning their nefarious intentions into fields of flowers. But it’s ok, isn’t it? After all, the person in front of you has committed a crime and must be rehabilitated; reckless driving, hit and run, and arson.\r\n\n\r\nSo, you get to work. Talking to Unid allows you to build a rapport and understand their motivations. You learn about their past. They talk of their difficult childhood, pets, a lack of support - broken systems that left them behind and put them on their current path. It doesn’t matter. You have a job to do. And now, with that bit of knowledge, you’ve found the 'bug' in their programming. After initiating a hack on their brain, you eradicate this flaw, forcefully transforming their mind into a paradise of purity. Unid will never commit another crime again. Have you done the right thing?\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Instead of commanding a group of rugged, blood-soaked mercenaries on a turn-based death crawl through unimaginable horrors, how about a neo-Victorian circus troupe brawling with biomechatronic Londoners? That's Circus Electrique, a turn-based RPG that's much more lighthearted than its Darkest Dungeon counterpart (and seemingly main inspiration). But after playing a preview of the game’s first mission, there's more than meets the eye in this part steampunk RPG, part circus tycoon management sim.\nYou play as Amelia, a young, bold journalist returning to London to cover the grand re-opening of the Circus Electrique. A metaphorical spanner gets lobbed into the works, however, as the ceremony is interrupted with news that London’s citizens have started attacking each other (more than your average fisticuffs to get on the tube). Oddly, this doesn’t seem to have affected Amelia and your motley circus troupe, who venture out into London’s dangerous streets to find answers.\nRead more",

I do, however, have a confession to make. When I started seeing other real life cats enjoying the game alongside their respective humans, I began to feel sad and a bit left out. You see, my cats Maple and Midna (still!) haven't shown any interest in Stray whatsoever, not even flicking up their ears in response to the cat's in-game meow. I'm not gonna lie, it kinda broke my heart a little bit.\nHowever, I'm beginning to think their (clear and apparent) hatred of video games goes further than simple disinterest. I was playing A Plague Tale for the first time last week, a game famous for its swarms of screeching rats, and STILL nothing. They love hunting rats and bringing them home to leave as little presents for us on our back door step. Heck, they'll even wig out and go into prowl mode when they hear them scrabbling away underneath our floorboards (yes, we do have a rat problem in our house). But clearly, their ice cold little murder hearts are unmoved by their video game equivalents. Is this what it's like when your children reject your hobbies and go and sulk in their rooms for the rest of the day? Because it sure does feel like it.\nRead more",

The move coincides with pre-orders also going live, but the good news is that your save data, progress and character levels from the demo will all transfer over to the final game should you decide to take the plunge in full when the game comes out on September 22nd.

I’ll be posting a more performance-and-hardware-focused guide to it later this week, but in the meantime I called up Jurjen Katsman, founder and senior director of development at Nixxes, and Mike Fitzgerald, core technology director at Insomniac, for a chat about how Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered makes the jump to PC.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "I've played a lot of Spider-Man games. To this day I nurture the belief that all tutorials should be narrated by Bruce Campbell. I even played Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions, which had four different web-dudes and later inspired the Spider-Verse storyline in the comics. Point is, I'm standing on pretty solid ground to judge Spider-Man games. Marvel's Spider-Man, originally released onto Sonyboxes in 2018, is finally coming to PC in a Remastered form, and let me tell you: it is a great Spidey game.\r\n\nYou know Spider-Man. He's a dude named Peter Parker who was bitten by a radioactive spider and can now climb up walls and punch criminals really well. Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered lets you roleplay being Spidey against the backdrop of a big, living New York city. It is, if you'll excuse the pun, amazing. Now, is it the best Spidey game? Nah. I reckon that's its spin-off/sequel Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, but that's not on PC yet. This means Marvel's Spider-Man gets to be the best wall-crawler game on PC for another few months, which isn't a bad consolation prize. \nRead more",

I mean, it worked on a base PS4, right? By my understanding the Steam Deck is basically just a PS4 with a screen slapped on it, so surely portable Spider-Manning wasn't an unrealistic thing to expect?\nAfter spending a few days testing out the game on the Deck I'm thrilled to confirm that Spider-Man Remastered plays great on Valve's handheld with only a few very minor caveats. Hooray! I can finally punch a Vulture in my back garden without getting shouted at by local bird protection services. What a time to be alive.\nRead more",

Katharine wakes up and immediately sets to work cleaning up the mountains of poop and vomit puddles left over from the previous night's revelries. As she works, she spies her good friend Alice B harvesting cauliflowers from the cult's garden, trying to keep as far as possible away from the (now slightly rotting) corpse of Graham that lays nearby. A cluster of other followers are busy dancing around a shrine in the centre of the village, but they all stop to witness a fight between the two oldest members of the cult - Alice0 and Liam. Ritual combat of the elderly is a staple of CultPaperShotgun, and as Alice0 delivers the final blow to an ailing Liam, cries of euphoria reverberate about the camp as his spirit (and chunks of flesh) are donated to the cause.\nWhere am I in all this, you ask? I, the Lamb, the glorious leader of our cult, the holy vessel of Death itself, and the sworn enemy of the Bishops of the Old Faith that are destined soon to die by my blade? I'm kicking back at a nearby camp, enjoying a spot of fishing and a friendly game of Knucklebones.\nThis, friends, is Cult Of The Lamb. And it is excellent.\nRead more",

Its vibrant cartoon visuals immediately caught my attention when I first sampled its Steam Next Fest demo earlier in the year, and I'm happy to report that the full game, out today, is just as captivating as it was back then. \nIt tells the tale of Toto and Gal, a pair of rambunctious siblings who end up far from home after getting lost inside a fantasy world of their own imagining. If they don't find a way back before nightfall, though, they'll be stuck there forever. A classic kids adventure story, in other words, but one that really relishes in its own sense of playfulness. Over the course of their four-odd hour adventure, they'll meet monster fighting frogs in a dark forest, board game-playing seagulls on the high seas, orc mechanics in a vast desert and even a heavy-metal loving sheep on a floating island in the sky as they make their way home  to their messy childhood bedroom. It all makes for some memorable puzzling backdrops, but be warned: if you're planning to play this with little ones, then you'll definitely need a puzzle savvy adult in the mix, as some of its brainteasers aren't quite as child-friendly as you might expect.\nRead more",

          "description": "Peter is a guy with his head in the clouds. Literally. Well, sort of. A climate science lecturer at Cambridge University, Peter's great passion in life is cloud research. All he wants to do is study clouds: their different formations, their flight paths, their properties, everything. He finds them so fascinating that they're the subject of his 100-page PhD thesis. It’s a poetic subject and one that matches his temperament as a boyish and awkward researcher. But around him the world is spiralling from the political tensions of the Cold War, and as much as Peter wishes to escape to in the clouds, current events are keeping him firmly tethered to the realities of an impending war. \nIt’s this tension that makes South Of The Circle such an engrossing story. With player choices that subtly tug the game’s narrative needle in ways you might not expect, it's clear skies and fair winds for the game’s three-hour journey. But with an abrupt ending after a calculated slow-burn drama, it's a rough landing.\nRead more",

This is backed with a 1TB NVMe SSD and 16GB of DDR5 RAM (!!), an impressive loadout that uses basically the fastest and latest-gen components you can fit into a laptop of this size. \nToday Best Buy in the US are doing a great price on this spec of the Zephyrus G14, charging $1399.99 for it rather than the launch price of $1649.99 - a $250 reduction. That's the best price we've seen for this model and an awesome deal on a compact yet powerful all-AMD laptop.\nRead more",

          "description": "Is it lazy to describe Turbo Golf Racing as ‘Rocket League if the cars were playing golf instead of football?' A bit, yes. But it’s also largely accurate. Up to eight players race across a track, ramming their boost-enabled car into their huge futuristic golf ball to send it flying forwards until (depending on your skill or luck) it flies/rolls/plops anticlimactically into the big hole at the end. It’s golf, sort of, but fast, demanding, and often unpredictable. You don’t even have to wear silly trousers while playing it, but that’s just my personal choice.\nOf course, it’s not quite so simple as hitting your ball forward and relying on the videogame gods to deem your ball worthy of reaching the goal before everybody else’s. There are 30 courses of varying length and complexity, and none of them are a simple drag race to the end. There are ramps, twists, turns, and plenty of obstacles. While the very shortest courses are pretty frictionless (I’ve won a few in under 20 seconds), the longest ones are practically begging you to make agonising mistakes.\nRead more",

          "description": "You only need one button\nNinja or Die is a peculiar name for a game, but I took a look at the ninja-slaying roguelite on Steam and I'm intrigued by... all of this. It's so fast and flashy, I can hardly keep up.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94IVbgfT0p0\nI've watched the trailer for Ninja or Die a few times now, and I'm still piecing it together; slow-mo helps, but I doubt it will fully click until we've tried playing it.\nNao Games and Marvelous Europe are hoping to blend \"hardcore action\" with \"simple controls,\" and I'm curious to see how that will pan out once the training wheels are off. Specifically, Ninja or Die uses one-button controls. \"Jump to where you point, eviscerate the enemy by dashing through them, and hold to attack with greater power.\"\nThe setup is that you're a secret agent in a \"ninja-eat-ninja world\" with bosses to bring down and hordes of smaller creeps to cut through. As a roguelite experience, death is a part of the deal and you'll accumulate perma-upgrades as well as alternate characters. You can power up your stats back at the village or \"pay the back-alley doctor.\"\n[caption id=\"attachment_340023\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1920\"] Those pesky Big Kite Ninjas.[/caption]\nAs opposed to some recent roguelites, Ninja or Die seems to emphasize high scores and replayability over a loop-based format that's servicing a larger story. On that note, levels are \"a mix\" of procedural and hand-crafted, and there's an Infinite Watchtower to run.\nThe pieces might not all add up in the end, but the strangeness appeals to me. I just hope that when I'm the one leaping around Japan like a madman, I have a better sense of my busy surroundings. From the outside looking in, readability is a concern.\nAs luck would have it, there's a browser-based demo to get a feel for it.\nAnother one for the wait-and-see wishlist? I think so.\nThe post Ninja or Die is a blisteringly fast roguelite action game with minimalist controls appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "How to make sure all those fancy skins transfer over\nOverwatch 2 is just a few months away. We've known that Overwatch 2 will have cross-progression for a while, and today Blizzard is explaining just how all of it will work.\nCross-progression means that all progression and in-game cosmetics in Overwatch 2 will span across different systems. While previously having, say, a fancy Tracer skin on PlayStation 4 didn't mean you could access it on PC, the new system will merge and allow you to use the skin on both.\nStarting today on August 16, players with a linked console account will be allowed to identify and confirm the accounts they want to merge. Once approved, the accounts will be prepared to merge on Overwatch 2's release. You'll need a Battle.net account no matter what, and all progress from the linked accounts will be stored on the Battle.net account.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aB-H8QFXA0\nAs Blizzard notes with red text and emphasis, there is just one opportunity to merge accounts. Make sure you check which accounts are being merged when you do so.\nThe Blizzard explainer goes into further detail, including addressing a few specific circumstances some players might run into during the merge process. All of this should serve to provide a central platform, similar to games like Fortnite, where cosmetics purchased in one place will be available on the others as well.\nOne giant closet of cosmetics\nAs Overwatch 2 moves the game from loot boxes to passes and a shop, having that access is a good thing. It's doubly so, since Overwatch 2 will also be taking the place of Overwatch on its launch; like a massive title update for the multiplayer side. The single-player part of Overwatch 2, meanwhile, is expected to arrive sometime later on in the future.\nOverwatch 2 will go live and free-to-play on October 4 for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.\nThe post Blizzard details how cross-progression will work with Overwatch 2 appeared first on Destructoid.",

In the home stretch before the 1.0 release of Grounded on September 27, Obsidian announced a Shared Worlds feature to make multiplayer less of a hassle.\nHere's the idea: You'll be able to create a Shared World that lives in the cloud and lets other players hop in even when you aren't around to host it.

In the wake of launching its latest game, Astro's Playroom, as a PlayStation 5 pack-in title, its next project will be its biggest one yet.\nIn a new interview with GamesIndustry.biz, creative and studio director Nicolas Doucet talks about some of what Asobi's been up to post-Playroom. Team Asobi is looking to keep tooling around with the DualSense, a key part of Astro's Playroom. And it's also looking to expand in scope, too.\nDoucet says Asobi's next game will follow in the footsteps of its previous games, will be a full-blown commercial title, and will be the \"biggest to date\" for the studio.\nThe team at Asobi has been steadily expanding, going from 35 to 60 members. Doucet expects that number to reach around 100. And the makeup is largely Japanese, which Doucet says the team wants to reflect in the games they make.\n\"We want to make sure that when people play our games that there is a feeling, and you can't quite put your finger on it, that it's made in Japan,\" said Doucet. You can find the full interview with GIbiz here.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu5VXrEqgco\nAstro's evolution\nTeam Asobi has been on a steady rise for some time. Astro Bot Rescue Mission was considered one of the better PlayStation VR games around. And Astro's Playroom was a delightful pack-in console launch game. The platformer harbored tons of nostalgia for the history of PlayStation and its hardware.\nDoucet and the team at Asobi have a clear penchant for working with the nuances of Sony's hardware. The studio lead says there's an extra team on the side at Asobi, always working on the technology and R&D. Where Asobi goes with the DualSense and its next big project, its biggest yet, will be exciting to see.\nThe post Team Asobi’s next project will be its ‘biggest’ to date appeared first on Destructoid.",

The intro vid-cum-loading screen will follow the two selected fighters as they step into the ring accompanied by some characterful animations and SF6's dopey, but adorable, \"Game Face\" staredown screen.\nIn the clip, we see the Korean taekwondo expert and former assassin Juri as she \"chats mad shit\", (Flanx's words), to her opponent. Newcomer Kimberly has no time for such mind games, instead taking the moment to hype up the crowd and perform some fancy ninja acrobatics. In a cute tough, Kimberly overshoots the camera and has to awkwardly scurry back into shot. That's fun.\nhttps://twitter.com/StreetFighter/status/1559329092675047425?s=20&t=RegOKDHCGSEuw2ArBLaX9g\nThe Game Face screen then slams into view, with Juri's punk rock sneer and puffed, grumpy cheeks meeting Kimberly's sarcastic gurn and knowing smile. It's a weird old mechanic, that's for sure, but I'll absolutely take it all over Street Fighter V's charisma-free presentation style. It will be fun to see all of the SF6 roster interact in such a fashion, though I imagine, for the most part, Juri is going to be going ignored by her opposition for most of these walkouts.\nStreet Fighter 6 launches in 2023 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms — while you wait, please check out our previous coverage, including our looks at Juri and Kimberly, our comments on Capcom's approach to the sequel's marketing, and our popular Five Do's and Do Not Do's feature.\nThe post Juri & Kimberly get their pout on in Street Fighter 6 Game Face vid appeared first on Destructoid.",

Or, at least, God of War Ragnarok. And since it's been a few years since 2018's God of War, a story recap might be of some use to folks as they gear up for the winter.\nPlayStation published a new video today, which recaps the story of Kratos and Atreus from the 2018 God of War. The storyteller walking us through it? None other than The Guild's own Felicia Day.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjucT-UZzgg\nThe rhyming tale takes a brief tour through the main story beats of God of War, pausing for a few jokes and asides from in-universe character Mimir. And while it doesn't cover every single beat, it does a pretty good job summing up Kratos and Atreus' journey, as well as some of the conflicts that arose and still persist headed into Ragnarok.\nWinter is coming\nIt's a good refresher to have too, as even though God of War was only a 2018 game, it does feel like eons ago to me at this point. Remembering the reason why Freya, for instance, has a bone to pick with Kratos seems like some important topical study material given some of the Ragnarok teases we've seen.\nGod of War Ragnarok is locked in for November 9, 2022. It's also one of the few games still in the holiday window, as more and more have been delayed out into the next year. Open-world wizarding RPG Hogwarts Legacy recently pushed back to February, and Marvel's Midnight Suns is on an undetermined delay as of this writing.\nRegardless, I'm really interested to see where the story goes from here, and how Sony Santa Monica Studios' interpretation of Norse mythology carries on. God of War Ragnarok arrives on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 on September 9, 2022.\nThe post Get caught up on God of War before Ragnarok with this story recap appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Squirrel with a Gun is nuts (in the best way)\nOne of the most fun things about following a bunch of game developers on Twitter is that you get to see the process of how some really cool indie games are made. That's exactly what happened to me with Dan DeEntremont's upcoming project Squirrel with a Gun — and yes, that's exactly what it sounds like.\nThe first I saw of this awesome game was a viral tweet from back in May of this year, where he showed off the first time he got fur on the squirrel. The whole thing looks insanely realistic, and obviously, the fact that the little fluffy rodent was holding and firing a gun caught everyone's attention. (I mean, who doesn't love a game with a fluffy, adorable protagonist.)\nhttps://twitter.com/QuiteDan/status/1525631771387338757\nOf course, the game has developed a whole lot more in the past few months, and it's pretty fun to scroll through DeEntremont's Twitter page and see all of the progress videos compiled in one spot.\nSquirrel with a Gun has rightfully gotten a lot of attention over the past few months, because I haven't seen a game capture the internet's sense of humor so accurately in a long time. Now the game has finally been listed on Steam, and while we may not have any kind of release window yet, it's cool to see a small developer making bits steps like that. I know I'm adding it to my wish list.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRz15LfZjBI\nSquirrel with a Gun is a testament to how social media has changed the landscape for indie developers in a big way. DeEntremont has been able to make this entire project by himself (at least to my knowledge) and garnered a huge following for it simply because he had a funny idea and the gumption to pull it off.\nHere's hoping that indie devs continued to be inspired by seeing others succeed like this, because the more goofy indie games there are in my life, the better.\nThe post Next up in hilariously adorable indie games: Squirrel with a Gun appeared first on Destructoid.",

First, it was going to be a game in the Pocky & Rocky series, only maybe not really. It looked to be aiming more at Kiki Kaikai, which the Pocky & Rocky games are the sequels to, but I’m not going to get into the finer details of why they’re almost two separate series. The quick version is this: Kiki Kaikai is Taito; Pocky & Rocky is Natsume. Yes, this means that Pocky & Rocky with Becky is more a part of the Kiki Kaikai series.\nAnyway, that’s boring.

Alongside the movies and series, the games of Disney and Marvel are getting spotlighted in a showcase on September 9.\nThe Disney & Marvel Games Showcase will air on Sept. 9 at 1 p.m. PT / 4 p.m. ET. Hosted by Kinda Funny's Blessing Adeoye Jr., it will feature updates on several projects currently in the works.\nThose showing off new content include Disney & Pixar Games, Marvel Games, Lucasfilm Games, and 20th Century Games. New reveals from farming life-sim Disney Dreamlight Valley, tactical hero game Marvel's Midnight Suns, and Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga are all in store.\nWe'll also get a sneak peek at the upcoming Marvel game from Skydance New Media. That's the studio that Uncharted's Amy Hennig is leading up, which is working on both a Marvel and Star Wars project.\n\"The Marvel Universe epitomizes all the action, mystery and thrills of the pulp adventure genre that I adore and lends itself perfectly to an interactive experience,\" said Hennig when the Marvel project was announced last year. \"It’s an honor to be able to tell an original story with all the humanity, complexity, and humor that makes Marvel characters so enduring and to enable our players to embody these heroes that they love.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsgOSQbgO1Q\nGames showcases, assemble\nBoth Disney and Marvel have had a strong video game presence over the years. And now, it's joining in on the summer of gaming showcases.\nIt's not the only company with a showcase in September, either. Ubisoft is planning to host an Ubisoft Forward the day after this Disney and Marvel showcase, on September 10. An open-world Star Wars game is in development at Ubisoft, headed by Massive Entertainment.

          "description": "Some of the late-hits are toned down, though\nArcade1Up has another retro-revival arcade cabinet on the way, and this one's for the sports fans. The new NFL Blitz Legends cabinet combines three remasters of the popular over-the-top NFL Blitz series.\nThe three games in the cabinet are 1997's NFL Blitz, 1998's NFL Blitz '99, and NFL Blitz 2000: Gold Edition from 1999. All three are remastered in the cabinet, which will go for $599.\nThe cabinet features Arcade1Up's usual details, like full side art and a matching riser. Four spots are open for play too, so you can get the whole crew on the sticks for some Blitz. And while it's good for local co-op, the Blitz cab also supports online multiplayer via Wi-Fi, as well as leaderboards.\nFor the cabinet, Arcade1UP partnered with the National Football League and Football Greats Alliance to feature all of the football greats. This includes Dan Marino, Jerry Rice, Deion Sanders, Brett Favre, Jerome Bettis, Terrell Davis, and Cris Carter.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6TXv6b2GcE\nDiving into the endzone\nSome of the more rowdy violence has been a bit toned back, however. According to a press release, a specific set of tackles and after-the-whistle hits were removed or edited in the remastered versions of these three NFL Blitz games. These changes support the NFL's current Player Health and Safety Initiatives. So sorry, a little bit of the after-the-whistle shenanigans will be tuned down, as they've been in other releases.\nThis isn't the only big arcade cabinet announcement out of Arcade1Up in the last few weeks. The at-home cabinet designer also announced a Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 cabinet at Evo 2022, bringing the classic crossover and several other cross-franchise fighters together for a fighting game collection.\nPre-orders for the NFL Blitz cabinet are live here at the Arcade1Up site. Shipping is expected to start sometime in early October.\nThe post Arcade1Up announces an NFL Blitz Legends cabinet with three football classics appeared first on Destructoid.",

Publisher THQ Nordic released a new trailer for the RTS title during this weekend's Digital Showcase.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah9O1LQXIvE\nOnce again set against the backdrop of Grand Chien, Jagged Alliance 3 sees the fictional republic overthrown by a dangerous paramilitary force following the mysterious disappearance of its president. As \"The Legion\" embeds itself within each and every sector of the troubled nation, the family of its missing ruler reaches out to the clandestine Adonis corporation to send its best team of black ops mercenaries to locate the president, defeat The Legion, and restore Grand Chien to its former state of (relative) order.\nThe new sequel, which will arrive a full two decades on from 1999's Jagged Alliance 2, will feature the tactical engagement and strategic gameplay of its predecessor, powered by a brand new engine and modern-day mechanics. A huge cast of new and familiar mercenaries will be made available for the player's home-grown militia, given access to a huge arsenal of weaponry, equipment, and explosive, town-rattling gear. Battle The Legion's forces, train local insurgents, and retake the Grand Chien street-by-street in explosive campaign action alone or with co-op support.\nJagged Alliance 3 is currently in development for PC.

          "description": "Thanks, Nintendo\n\"Nintendo DLC\" is still a weird phrase to utter out loud. At one point in the gaming landscape I never really seriously thought it would be a widespread option, but it's rampant enough now to the point where it can be considered part of the company's identity.\nThey adopted the practice a little over a decade ago on the 3DS, where it sometimes was implemented in a janky fashion. From there they expanded to the Wii U. And even then I wasn't used to it! But once Nintendo started doing regularly scheduled DLC for nearly all of its games on Switch, it all fell into place. I've accepted it.\nWhich leads me to this: an official Nintendo DLC tutorial video. If you're confused on how to buy more stuff, they have you covered! The below video walks folks through the steps of redeeming the free DLC offers via their Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack benefits. It's as simple as \"going into the Switch Online menu, then scrolling down, looking at the benefits on offer, and clicking on them until you can hit a download button.\"\nRight now that selection mostly involves Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and Splatoon 2 DLC. Of note, it does not involve Super Mario Bros. 35, which is still discontinued.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDw5YSIy4wg\nThe post Nintendo shows people how to download DLC in a new official video appeared first on Destructoid.",

For one thing, they're always super expensive, and I'm trying to ball on a budget over here.

          "description": "\"We're not considering that at this point\"\nNintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa has been relatively accessible since he took over, and this past week, he spoke to financial outlet Nikkei about the lack of a Nintendo Switch price hike for the foreseeable future. Well, that's the plan anyway.\nFurukawa noted that they are \"not considering\" a Nintendo Switch price hike \"at this point,\" with two factors in play. The chief concern is \"pricing people out,\" given that they're aiming to expand their market and play the long game (Nintendo has also comfortably been in a position of being the cheapest mainstream gaming hardware throughout its history).\nAnother potential way the blow has been softened is through software sales, given that Nintendo also produces games that they want to keep viable with a large install base. Nintendo says that they want to \"maintain the momentum\" of the Switch so far. The issue apparently isn't with the actual innards of the Switch, but rather that \"demand exceeds supply.\"\nSo how are they staying the course without a price hike? Furukawa concedes that the \"OLED model will continue to be less profitable than our other models,\" because \"costs have undoubtedly increased for shipping not only by air, but also by sea.\" But he also notes: \"The weak yen may be seen as a benefit for Nintendo, since such a large share of our sales comes from abroad, but our overseas promotional and staff costs also go up. We're making more inventory purchases in foreign currencies to counter that.\"\nThe post Nintendo president says no Switch price hike is coming appeared first on Destructoid.",

Private Division has signed Weta Workshop to a new publishing agreement, for a new game set in J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth.\nWeta Workshop is a well-known effects and prop company that worked on Peter Jackson's adaptation of The Lord of the Rings. The company founded an interactive game division in 2014, and now is tackling The Lord of the Rings in game form.\n\"It's a privilege to create a new game set in Middle-earth, especially one that's so different from what fans have played previously,\" said Amie Wolken, head of interactive at Weta Workshop, in a statement. \"As fans ourselves, we're excited for gamers to explore Middle-earth in a way they never have before, and introduce new fans to the magic of The Lord of the Rings.\"\nDetails on the new project are scarce, as it's still in early development. No release date is set yet. But Private Division says the game is expected to launch sometime during Take-Two's 2024 fiscal year. More details will arrive sometime in the future.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQ7aLU6rHLk\nMiddle-earth's back on the menu, boys\nPrivate Division is a publishing arm of Take-Two Interactive, and has been behind some notable games like OlliOlli World and The Outer Worlds. The company also acquired OlliOlli developer Roll7. It will also publish Ori developer Moon Studios' next game.\nThere are a few different Lord of the Rings projects in development. Whether you like to sneak around as a sneaky little Gollum on a quest for his precious, or dig into a survival-type game, there are a few Middle-earth projects to watch. We'll see what Weta brings to the table when it's ready to share more about its own interactive LOTR project.\nThe post Private Division and Weta Workshop sign deal for new game set in Middle-earth appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Guild Wars 2 celebrates its 10th anniversary this month, and ArenaNet is celebrating by introducing the MMORPG to a new audience on Steam. \nOn Tuesday, August 23, Guild Wars 2 will be available on a third-party platform for the first time ever. Since its launch in August 2012, the game has only been accessible through ArenaNet’s proprietary launcher. Guild Wars 2 on Steam will retain its subscription-less, free-to-play model. Additionally, Steam players and those on the original client will play together on the same servers. If you’re a newcomer wanting to catch up on a decade’s worth of content, a $99.97 Complete Edition of the game for Steam bundles Guild Wars 2’s three expansions and all five seasons.\nArenaNet is introducing Twitch Drops. Now you can earn exclusive in-game character outfits, experience boosters, and a special Glowing Purple Mask cosmetic by watching streamers play the game from August 23-28. \n\n\n“Guild Wars 2 has delighted over 16 million players for a decade with its subscription-free business model, epic collaborative open-world boss encounters, and revolutionary mount system,” said Kendall Boyd, Senior Vice President of Marketing at NCSOFT West. “By launching on Steam, a whole new audience of players who have never had the chance to adventure with us will be able to experience one of the greatest fantasy worlds in gaming. Everyone at NCSOFT and ArenaNet is excited to welcome them into our amazing community.”\nGuild Wars 2 has been hailed as one of the best MMOs of its time. ArenaNet has supported the title with seasonal updates and expansion packs, the latest being February’s End of Dragons.\nDo you still play Guild Wars 2? Will you be picking it up on Steam to dive in for the first time? Let us know in the comments!",

          "description": "The Knights of the Old Republic remake sounds like it may be running into some trouble, but fans of the original classic BioWare game have reason to celebrate. Celebrated collectibles maker Gentle Giant is prepping a new statue depicting one of the central characters of the original game. Jedi Knight Bastila Shan has never looked better.\nThe action-posed figure depicts Bastila Shan in battle with a Guardian Droid in the ruins of Dantooine, one of the early sites players visited in the game. The statue is made of PVC, and looks to feature some impressive sculpting and paint work. The yellow-hued double-bladed lightsaber in mid-swing is a particular highlight.\n\nIf it’s been a few years since you ventured into the classic Star Wars RPG, Bastila Shan was a Jedi Master many thousands of years before the events of the Skywalker Saga. Among other gifts provided by the Force, she had the rare capability known as battle meditation, which could be used to boost her allies and demoralize her enemies. At one point, she was tortured and turned to the dark side by Darth Malak, and the player is given a choice of how to interact with her – including options to redeem or kill her.\nThe new statue is steering toward launch in spring of 2023, but pre-orders open in just a few days, on 8/19 over at Gentle Giant’s official site. Suggested retail price is 80 republic credits, or $80 if you prefer your local currency.",

The cosmetics include Goku, Vegeta, and Bulma with alternate styles, Beerus, and back bling items like Seer Fish, Power Pole, Kamesennin’s Shill, and two new Pickaxes. Nimbus and Space Pod gliders also appear with an anime-themed Kamehameha attack to decimate foes the Saiyan way. Finally, creative maps contain cool locations like Kami’s Palace, Goku’s House, the Room of Spirit and Time, and more. \nThe description of the event reads as follows:\nThe Fortnite Dragon Ball Crossover awaits die-hard fans today. \n[Source: Gamespot]",

This includes titles like Disney Dreamlight Valley, Marvel's Midnight Suns, Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, and even a \"sneak peek at the upcoming ensemble game from Skydance New Media.\" \nJUST ANNOUNCED: Watch the Disney & Marvel GAMES SHOWCASE on Friday, September 9 – live from #D23Expo 2022! https://t.co/uZcDYdUZKA pic.twitter.com/RJ67ooTR2F\nAugust 15, 2022\nYou might recognize Skydance New Media as the studio where former Uncharted series director Amy Hennig works as president. Connecting those dots means the sneak peek at the upcoming ensemble game from Skydance New Media is the first sneak peek of Hennig's new game, which she revealed as a narrative-driven, action-adventure game last year. \nConsidering it's an ensemble game, it could be any number of famous Marvel squads or families. However, it's probably a safe bet to assume it won't be the Avengers since Crystal Dynamic's Avengers is only two years old and still getting updates. We also know it won't be the Midnight Suns, as XCOM developer Firaxis is developing that. I'm hoping Hennig's game is based on the X-Men, but since it's an ensemble game, it could be something like the Inhumans, the Fantastic Four, or even the New Avengers, too. Only time will tell, but fortunately, we have less than a month of waiting to go because the Disney and Marvel Games Showcase airs on Sept. 9. \nWhat Marvel heroes do you hope Hennig's game features?

That team is now developing a “new game set in the Middle-earth universe of J.R.R. Tolkien,” according to a press release. Middle-earth Enterprises has licensed the literary works of the series to Wētā Workshop, too, giving the studio “the broadest creative license to interpret the underlying lore of the books.” \n“We are thrilled to partner with Wētā Workshop to publish a game set in such an extraordinary and celebrated universe,” Private Division head Michael Worosz writes in a press release. “The Lord of the Rings IP is home to so many remarkable stories, and no entity is better equipped than the team at Wētā Workshop to create a distinctive, new Middle-earth gaming experience.” \nWētā Workshop’s gaming lead, Amie Wolken, says it's a privilege to create a new game set in Middle-earth, especially one that’s going to be “so different from what fans have played previously.” \n“As a fan ourselves, we’re excited for gamers to explore Middle-earth in a way they never have before, and introduce new fans to the magic of The Lord of the Rings,” Wolken writes in the press release. \nThis new Lord of the Rings game does not yet have a title and is early in development. It doesn’t have a release date either, but it’s expected to launch sometime during Take-Two’s Fiscal Year 2024 (April 2023 - March 2024). \nWhile waiting to learn more about this game, check out the latest gameplay from The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, which was recently delayed out of its Sept. 1 release date by a few months.

          "description": "Let’s rock, baby! Season 6 of Video Gameography gets stylish as we examine the Devil May Cry series! Over the next few weeks, we’ll be covering the history and lore of Capcom’s premiere action franchise, and this episode takes aim at the lauded yet somewhat polarizing Devil May Cry 4. \nDevil May Cry 4 took the series to a new generation of hardware, including Xbox for the first time. That's only one of the many firsts for this entry. Capcom moved Dante aside to place newcomer Nero in the starring role, who brought his demon arm Devil Bringer as the new centerpiece mechanic. Dante wasn't completely shunned, however; players control him during the adventure's questionably designed back half. In this episode, we'll discuss DMC 4's bizarre 2005 reveal, Capcom's reasoning behind Nero's conception, the fan reaction to the Xbox launch, and what it's really like to visit Fortuna's inspiration, Vatican City. \nJoin hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7) and the returning host of The Great Game Debate podcast Wes Bates (@GreatGameDeb8), as we unpack Nero's big debut. \nIf you’d like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com.

Join us today on Twitch at 3 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. \nMetal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. \nWatch on Twitch!\nJoin me, Marcus Stewart, along with Andrew Reiner and Blake Hester, as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure.

Of course, it’s not a 1-to-1 recreation, but Infinity Ward says Farm 18’s center, which is a large shoot house, was inspired by Modern Warfare’s Shoothouse.\nCheck it out for yourself below: \nWelcome to Farm 18. Location: [classified]. Shoothouse optional. #ModernWarfare2 #IntelDrops pic.twitter.com/OkZuuwjPXD\nAugust 11, 2022\nAs you can see, the map looks like it’s going to be a great time. Players looking to play it safe can stick to the outside, using the overgrown brush to conceal them while stalking the level’s perimeter. Those looking for a riskier fight can head into the central warehouse, where they’ll find themselves in the Shoothouse-inspired part of Farm 18. \nFor more about Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, check out the game’s first extended gameplay reveal from earlier this summer, and then read our preview of the game after checking it out in June.

The game is the debut by Inflexion Games, a team consisting of former Bioware developers, including ex-general manager Aaron Flynn. \nIn a message posted to Twitter, Inflexion explains it delayed the launch for two reasons. One, it’s migrating the game to Unreal Engine 5. Two, it needs the extra time to ensure it's polished and packed with content before players can begin testing it out. You can read Inflexion's full message below (click the image to enlarge). \nNightingale debuted during The Game Awards 2021 and is a PvE crafting and survival game that can be played alone or in co-op. Players find themselves stranded in a Victorian Gaslamp fantasy world connected by a network of portals. To survive, they’ll have to harvest materials such as wood and ore to construct weapons, equipment, and buildings. Jumping through portals transports players to new biomes such as deserts, swamps, and jungles. Nightingale’s appearance during this year’s Summer Game Fest introduced Realm Cards used to unlock new areas and influence the type of content, such as enemies and resources, they contain. \nSo far, Nightingale is only confirmed to launch for PC via Steam.",

Soccer Story is slated to release later this year for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, PC, and Stadia.\nYour role in Soccer Story begins one year after an event called The Calamity, which apparently has made soccer illegal. A magic soccer ball chooses you to be the so-called Savior of Soccer, a role that will also help heal the world.\nNo More Robots states Soccer Story delivers over 15 hours of gameplay unfolding through story-based missions and side activities. You'll apparently square off against sharks, toddlers, old-age pensioners, and ninjas as you complete these tasks and solve puzzles using the ball.\nIn addition to the single-player campaign, Soccer Story features a four-player local multiplayer mode, with each team led by an animal captain.\nSoccer Story is not developed by SideBar Games, the team behind the wonderful Golf Story title, but it does appear to draw plenty of inspiration from it, including the name.\nLet us know what you think of this surprising game announcement in the comments section below!",

Kenshi’s goal: take down a fully cybernetic Kano and his Black Dragon clan. Kenshi has another ace up his sleeve in the form of a powerful ally (?) in Sub-Zero. Some of the characters that appear include Shang Tsung and Kabal and even lesser seen faces like Tremor and Kira. \n\n\nSnow Blind is the third Mortal Kombat Legends film following 2021’s Battle of the Realms and 2020’s Scorpion’s Revenge.

          "description": "Embark Studios, a young team of former DICE employees led by ex-EA head Patrick Söderlund, has delayed its upcoming shooter, Arc Raiders. The title was initially slated to arrive this year but will now launch in 2023. \nThe reason is that the team has decided to pivot and focus on launching another team-based shooter codenamed Project Discovery. A blog post written by Söderlund explains that Embark has several projects in development and that Discovery progressed so quickly that it seemingly caught up to Arc Raiders, presenting the team with the possibility of shipping two games within the same timeframe. However, doing would've been more than the small team can handle. \n“For a young, relatively small studio like ours, releasing two games in short succession would have strained our teams and resources, many of which are shared between the two projects.” Söderlund explains. \n“As such, we decided to let Project Discovery be our studio’s first game to market, pushing Arc Raiders to a 2023 release. It’s a decision that will also allow us to expand and refine the Arc Raiders experience.”\nOutside of being a team-based first-person shooter, little is known about Project Discovery. The concept art posted above hints that it's set in the current day or perhaps the near future. Söderlund promises to reveal more details “very soon.” \nArc Raiders made its debut during the 2021 Game Awards and will be a free-to-play cooperative shooter where players work together to battle mechanical creatures from space. It will launch for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

The highest-grossing video game film in U.S. history already had a confirmed threequel in the works, but today we found out exactly when we'll see Sonic and friends return to the big screen, and it’ll be chillier than usual.\nThe official movie Twitter account announced the unofficially titled Sonic the Hedgehog 3 will premiere in theaters on December 20, 2024. This marks a big seasonal shift for the franchise as Sonic 1 and 2 arrived during the first halves of their respective years, with the first movie premiering on Valentine's Day and the second arriving in April. \nRunning faster, flying higher, and punching harder. #SonicMovie3 hits theatres on December 20, 2024. pic.twitter.com/DcFGbaKUao\nAugust 9, 2022\nThe tweet doesn’t reveal anything else about the film, but if you’ve seen the post-credits scene for Sonic 2, you already have a good inkling of where the series is headed. \nDecember 2024 is a long way off, but Paramount plans to fill the gap with a live-action series starring Idris Elba’s Knuckles hitting Paramount+ next year. There’s also Sonic Prime, Netflix’s animated series that, while disconnected from the film universe, provides another avenue to enjoy the Blue Blur on the small screen. With the next big video game, Sonic Frontiers, slated to launch this fall, the next few years look pretty bright for Sega's mascot. \nYou can read our review of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 here.",

Instead of racing to a finish line, your objective is stop...in the marked parking stop.  \nStopping in a parking spot might sound easy but as you'll soon find out, it's anything but because each track is littered with obstacles such as barriers that immediately destroy your car, magnets aiming to pull you off the track, boosters, jump pads, and more. You must survive through it all in order to reach the coveted parking spot at the end of the road. \nCheck it out for yourself in the New Gameplay Today below: \n\n\nEnjoy this first look at You Suck At Parking as Wesley briefly introduces you to the world of the game before taking a back seat to let you enjoy some uninterrupted gameplay (that's harder than it looks so when you see me die a bunch of times, no you didn't).

We already knew additional Sonic-themed costumes were planned for Fall Guys this month, but developer Mediatonic this morning announced the details of the collaboration event with Sega's iconic brand. The event is meant to celebrate over 30 years of Sonic the Hedgehog and includes a new Sonic-themed level and new outfits. \nThe new level is called \"Bean Hill Zone\" and tasks the Fall Guys beans with collecting as many rings as possible to win special rewards. If players earn 200 points, they get a \"Bean Hill Zone\" nameplate. Earning 400 points yields 200 kudos, 600 points get a Bonus Rings Pattern outfit, 800 points gives 400 kudos, and 1,000 points gives you access to Sonic's iconic sneakers.\nThose aren't the only rewards you can snatch up during this event, though. New costumes for Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Super Sonic, and Dr. Robotnik are all available in the store during the event. You can also buy the Sonic Foot Tap emote.\nThis isn't Sonic's first appearance in Fall Guys as a costume. Back in 2020, players could pick up this Sonic costume. This special Fall Guys event featuring Sonic the Hedgehog begins on Thursday, August 11, and runs until Monday, August 15.\nFall Guys originally launched on PlayStation 4 and PC, where it found overwhelming success as a fun gameshow-style twist on the battle royale genre, in 2020. In 2021, publisher Epic Games acquired Fall Guys developer Mediatonic. Earlier this summer, Fall Guys changed from a premium model to a free-to-play model, and launched on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and Switch.",

A Take-Two earnings report revealed that the game had been pushed out of its October 7 date to an unspecified release within the 2023 fiscal year. That means it will now arrive sometime before March 31, 2023.\nThe game’s Twitter account confirmed the delay with a message, embedded below, that also revealed that the game will now have a staggered release. Midnight Suns will come to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC first within the fiscal year. The PS4, Xbox One, and Switch versions arrive sometime after that. \nImportant update from the Midnight Suns team pic.twitter.com/79yVfzpDED\nAugust 8, 2022\nWhile Midnight Suns will only face a five-month setback at most (for current-gen, at least) and could technically still arrive in 2022, seeing it suffer another delay is disappointing nonetheless. The game was first announced almost a year ago at last year’s Gamescom. It graced Game Informer’s cover that month and was first scheduled to launch this March before being delayed to October. A reimagining of the Rise of the Midnight Sons comic event, players control a team of occult heroes like Blade, Magik, and Nico Minoru and Avengers like Iron Man, Captain America, and Spider-Man to battle Lilith, the mother of all demons. Midnight Suns' turn-based combat utilizes a card system for selecting commands, and between battles players explore a headquarters where they can socialize and bond with their teammates. \nWe played the first four hours of Marvel’s Midnight Suns in June and wrote up seven takeaways based on our time with it.

The update will also be available on PC.\nFor the unfamiliar, rollback netcode is a system that provides a nearly lag-free online experience, hence why it's always a highly desirable feature in the fighting game community. During EVO 2022, DBFZ producer Tomoko Hiroki shared that the current-gen versions will support rollback netcode, whereas the PS4 and Xbox One editions will not. There's no release window for upgraded ports, but a message from Bandai Namco's Twitter account states we'll learn more information later and that it will take \"some time\" before the system is finished. \nWhile that's bad news for those who don't own a PS5 or Xbox Series X/S, Bandai Namco is at least planning some sort of upgrade path for existing game owners on current consoles (such as Smart Delivery on Xbox). There's no mention if the Switch version will receive a rollback netcode.  \nHiroki also announced that Dragon Ball FighterZ is now content-complete, meaning it will not receive any more fighters or balance updates. The game received three DLC fighter packs during its lifetime that added over a dozen characters to its roster. \nDragon Ball FighterZ first launched in January 2018 and was hailed as one of the best fighting games of the decade and arguably the best Dragon Ball video game period.

Join us in the Splatlands for roughly 30 minutes of updates! pic.twitter.com/iFfaU3V6vM\nAugust 8, 2022\nAs you can see, there’s not much else to glean from this news. If you’re the kind of person who anticipates game-focused Directs to reveal information about other anticipated titles, I would say you should not do that with this one. It seems very much a “we’re only going to talk about Splatoon 3” kind of Direct announcement. Of course, I could be wrong, but you know, expectations and all that. \nHowever, if you’re a Splatoon fan, it sounds like Wednesday will be an excellent day. Not only are you getting new Splatoon 3 details and information, but “roughly 30” minutes of it – that’s a lot! As for what to expect, new weapons, characters, maps, and story details will likely be showcased. This will probably be the last Splatoon 3-focused Direct, too, considering the game hits Switch less than a month after it on Sept. 9. \nWhile waiting for Wednesday’s Direct, check out this Splatoon 3-themed Switch console and then listen to this new punk rock-inspired track from Splatoon 3’s soundtrack.

Hungry wolves back on the prowl. A new destiny hidden in darkness. New Fatal Fury/Garou green-lit.” \nCheck it out for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, SNK didn’t reveal much else, and if you’re a Fatal Fury fan, you probably have many questions. Will this new game adopt a 3D art style like other modern fighting franchises such as Street Fighter 6, or will it stick with traditional 2D art? Which fighters are returning? Will there be new fighters? Only time will tell. \nIf you’re unfamiliar with Fatal Fury, you might recognize the name Terry Bogard, who regained some popularity after his inclusion in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. He’s the protagonist of the Fatal Fury fighting game series. If you don’t recognize that name either, nobody can blame you – the last Fatal Fury game came out 23 years ago, with Fatal Fury: Mark of the Wolves’ release in 1999. \nIt’s unclear when we’ll hear more about this new Fatal Fury game, but it’s nice to know at least a game is in development for the classic fighting franchise. \nAre you excited about a new Fatal Fury game?
