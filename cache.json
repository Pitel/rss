Games that allow you to both explore and soak in a beautiful atmosphere while keeping your grey cells busy - Lumote: The Mastermote Chronicles could certainly help to fill that gap. Developed by Luninawesome Games and published by Wired Productions, it's heading to Switch (and a whole lot of other platforms) on 24th March, so there's not long to wait.\nHaving been well received in early access on Steam, the full game will arrive with additional content and adjustments based on fan feedback. What immediately stood out to us in a recent presentation was the art style and its fantastical sub-aquatic setting, with varied 'Motes' — essentially creatures with special abilities — that drive the puzzle solving.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

This is the case for Maglam Lord, which has now landed in the West. In Maglam Lord, players take control of a demon lord with the excessively-metal name of Killzerk as they try to regain their powers and bring their species back from the brink of extinction.\nThe opening cutscene in this action-RPG shows Killzerk taking the fight to the immortal gods, only to fall back to Earth and take an extended power nap. When they awaken, the world is a very different place. Magic is no longer plentiful, and they are the last of their kind left in the world. The power that they once used to challenge the gods is quickly fading from them and can only be replenished by fighting monsters.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

And what if you, a sort of sci-fi Sherlock Holmes, able to investigate a crime scene using revolutionary nano-tech, were able to figure out what happened? That's the idea behind Forest Grove, an upcoming narrative puzzle-thriller that's all about reconstructing the truth.\nAn heiress goes missing, and foul play is suspected. The Remote Forensics Bureau is called in, and they recreate the lavish estate of the Kunstimatigaard family using their new Nanodeck technology to clone the whole thing, allowing investigators to explore the house, collect evidence, and watch reconstructions of the various scenes that led up to the disappearance of Zooey Kunstimatigaard, the teen heiress to her dead parents' fortune.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Thus began America's Army, a series of tactical first-person shooters funded and released for free by the Army as a recruitment tool. But the series has seemingly petered out and now they're preparing to end support for the latest, America's Army: Proving Grounds.

          "description": "Lost Ark is a new free-to-play MMORPG that is notable because a) it is a hack 'n' slash grind that makes it a bit like a free version of Diablo, b) I have no idea what is happening at any given point in time while playing it, instead drowning in a soup made of words like 'destiny', and c) the player characters look like they work at a sex dungeon. Specifically work at, rather than participate in. They serve drinks and clean wipe-down sofas for minimum wage, and they don't particularly want to be wearing a latex catsuit, but here we are. \nFor example, I'm pretty sure my gunslinger character works at a steampunk cowboy themed erotique parlour. I actually quite enjoy her attack style, a sort of hyper-aggressive DPS that allows her to switch between three different gun stances (pistols, shotgun and rifle). The dual pistols in particular come with a load of crowd-control AOE attacks like explosions and spinning  bullets firing smaller bullets, or something. And while there is some kind of story involving demons and a war and bits of stone (something something destiny), my gunslinger's quest is, currently, the single-minded pursuit of a pair of trousers.\nRead more",

I am incapable of any kind of meaningful conflict resolution, and embarrassingly vulnerable to being destroyed by hundreds of angry men with swords over the course of several helpless minutes. \r\n\n\nDiplomacy Is Not An Option doesn’t bill itself as a tower defence game, but it is a real-time strategy game about protecting your medieval settlement as wave after wave of attackers try to smash it up. Rather than have you traipsing around the map in search of trouble to make, there is a refreshing focus on defence – offence’s nerdy younger sister –  with victory determined not by how well you’ve conquered the surrounding land, but how capable you are of taking a beating and coming out on top. \r\n\n \nRead more",

That left our Interceptor free to shoot a nearby statue down on top of a cultist before stabbing him and his friend to death, which in turn gave our Apothecary enough space to chuck a grenade at a bridge and send three Poxwalkers plummeting to their doom. \nI’m no Warhammermun.

(In fact, I ended up downloading the game because it streamed fine at like 10am but at peak times it went all pixely, like someone had huffed on my glasses.)\nReader, I bloody love Death's Door. Like Katharine said, it's kind of a more gentle Soulslike, with a Studio Ghibli-esque flair to the character design and world.

After filing our OlliOlli World review, I investigated and, yup, you stumble across him in one particularly fiendish level, where he is being used as promotional bait by a scheming business frog. Good thing no real company would stoop so low as to use Daniel T's likeness in such a cynical, ultimately successful way. \nAhem. Well, if Danny Trejo can show up in this kickflip 'em up, what other cameos may appear? We used the game's character customisation menu to cook up some possibilities.\nRead more",

It's tailing off now, but still averaging 60,000 Steam users over the last three months, a surge you'd think would be worth celebrating, right? I investigated and discovered that Mir4 is one bizarre game, with one soul-crushing USP: NFTs.\nThat's right folks. The game lets you mint your character as an NFT, and even mine cryptocurrency if you so choose. If this is the future, then it seems cold and strange and sad.

I, however, was privy to a hands-off presentation that comprised a whole half an hour of Ghostwire Tokyo being played. What luxury!\nIt reminded me much less of The Evil Within than I expected. It has a lot of horror elements, don't get me wrong, but Ghostwire: Tokyo is much more of an action game using the language of horror to convey its themes than the other way around. Rather than spending most of your time on the back foot, creeping around in the hope you can get past a lumbering ball of dead lady limbs with most of your health intact, time in Ghostwire: Tokyo is more likely spent one-shotting headless demon schoolgirls with a bow and arrow. The general vibe, if not the specifics, reminded me a lot of classic, thundering 90s and 00s action films like Blade. So, in other words, Ghostwire: Tokyo looks rad as hell. Even better, it's also unashamedly strange.\nRead more",

(Also found in this repertoire are Nazis and Slimes. They are beyond the scope of this listicle.) The zombie is a preternaturally killable being. It has already experienced mortality once, so this creature more than anyone is ready to suffer the ignominy of death. It has practice, it knows what's coming. Being a zombie is like having two degrees. You're extra qualified, and you probably groan a lot.\nHere's a list of the best zombies in PC games.\nRead more",

You are, in essence, the pale captain of a battleship that must weave its way through demons and bats. The garlic and holy water cannons will take care of the rest.\nNot only do I crave more vampiric survival, but I also wish it had been released years ago. This is the perfect pre-lesson huddle.

Plus, could Matthew Save the world if he grew to six size the times of the earth and cut off a slab of his bum like a big steak, to feed us all?

I do take some comfort in the fact that NFTs are so unpopular that Riot had scramble to cover after accidentally suggesting a Valorant character liked NFTs. And I especially enjoyed Yanis Varoufakis explaining why the metacryptofungiverse sucks. But more and more companies are talking about NFTs and things will get worse, and I'll need the energy I can only get from Precinct 13 (and the amazing unused Jimmy Chambers song based on it).\nBut the terrible future can wait, what are you playing this weekend?\nRead more",

          "description": "Through an entirely unplanned sequence of events, I'm currently playing two big action adventure games that couldn't be less alike. One is God Of War, a big, serious dadventure epic about an emotionally distant father trying his darnedest to connect with his (at times very irritating) son. The other is Kena: Bridge Of Spirits, an altogether more wholesome adventure about a young girl cleansing a lush, forested mountainside from a serious case of bad vibes and helping lost ghosts pass on to the other side. \nAbout the only thing they have in common is that they both have what one might call 'cute' NPC companions. Dad Of War is joined by his eager archer \"BOY!\" Atreus, while Kena has her gaggle of black, fluffy Rot friends (above, right). According to the widely accepted law of big googly-eyes, I should find the Rot absolutely adorable and thus beyond reproach. Atreus does not have big googly-eyes (they are merely wide and naive), but he is certainly a lot cuter than God Of War's other main companion, a talking disembodied head. And yet. Even though Atreus has now reached that stage where he's doing all his adolescent whining and rebellion and \"I know you are, but what am I?\" nonsense in the space of about two hours, I would much rather have this sulky pre-teen by my side than the interminable Rot. Let me explain.\nRead more",

Only you - through the power of bare-bones ARPG combat and a fun but limited golf mini-game - can save the noble sport from ostensible nonexistence. \nI say ostensible because, in reality, golf is everywhere. Our heroine Aerin’s hometown is called Mulligandale. It has two shops, one of them dedicated entirely to golf. Folk shimmy about in golfwear, talking about golf. Many give out golf-related quests, the rewards for which are usually some form of golfing paraphernalia, often golf balls. The actual golf courses themselves have been sealed off by an ill-defined big villainous, but if you put a translucent barrier around the thing you’re trying to crush and still let the people you’re attempting to terrorise build their entire society as a monument to it, you’re basically asking for a plucky hero to restore the national passtime to glory. Highly questionable bit of villainy, this.\nRead more",

          "description": "Sony teased an exciting AI reveal last week and today, it unveiled Gran Turismo Sophy, a new AI developed in partnership with Polyphony Digital that races vehicles so well that it outperforms professional GT drivers. \nOn the surface, it looks like a very good driving AI and if you’re anything like me, you’ve had your butt kicked by AI drivers in the likes of Need for Speed, Dirt, and even Gran Turismo before. However, Sony’s presentation today, which included speakers from Polyphony Digital including Gran Turismo 7 producer Kazunori Yamauchi, showcased just how great Sophy is at Gran Turismo. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nBefore diving into the brain behind Sophy, let me mention how Sony showcased Sophy’s AI strength during a preview Game Informer attended: they had multiple profes…",

          "description": "When Microsoft announced its plans to purchase Activision Blizzard, one of the first questions was whether Call of Duty and the publisher's other existing titles would eventually become Xbox exclusives. Head of Xbox Phil Spencer quickly stated that Microsoft plans to honor existing contractual agreements between Sony and Activision regarding Call of Duty specifically and vaguely expressed a desire to keep the series on PlayStation. \nThough pretty definitive, the second bit of Phil's statement left room for interpretation. A new blog post by Microsoft further clarifies its commitment to keeping Activision Blizzard titles multiplatform. The post, which discusses a new set of Microsoft Store principles in preparation for the Activision acquisition approval process, says the following:\nIn short, Microsoft will continue to allow future Call of Duty entries and other titles to remain multiplatform even after they're not legally required to. You can still interpret this message to refer to existing franchises with established fanbases. New IPs could be a different story. But for now, those who want to continue playing Overwatch, Diablo, or Crash Bandicoot on multiple consoles seemingly have nothing to worry about in the long term. \nAs a reminder, assuming Microsoft's acquisition passes the lengthy government approval process, the deal isn't expected to close until around the summer of 2023. Activision Blizzard continues to operate as an independent entity until that time. If/when that happens, it's good to know that whatever dead Activision franchises Microsoft chooses to resurrect have a strong chance of appearing on non-Xbox platforms.",

          "description": "During a special livestream hosted by Geoff Keighly, The Wolf Among Us 2's first trailer premiered along with a release window of 2023. Keighly sat down with Telltale's designers and voice actors to spill the beans on what's in store for the long-awaited second season.\nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nThe Wolf Among Us 2 takes place six months after the first season, still well before the Fables comic series it's based on. Bigby Wolf (Adam Herrington) has been suspended from his role as sheriff of Fabletown by his new boss Snow White (Erin Yvette), who has become the deputy mayor overseeing a reformed administration. Cut loose and in anger management, Telltale says much of the tale revolves around Bigby having to discover his own definitions of good and evil as he meets a New York City detective and assists them on a difficult new case. Players can expect to bump into returning faces and newcomers, including characters from The Wizard of Oz, such as the Scarecrow and Tin Man. \nThe game has been rebuilt in Unreal instead of Telltale's old gameplay engine. Telltale wouldn't divulge gameplay specifics, only saying it would be rooted in the foundation of season 1 with some new additions. The trailer primarily shows scenes from Episode 1, and The Wolf Among Us will consist of five episodes total. Telltale also confirmed the sequel is in full production after spending the last couple of years in the pre-planning phase. \nThe Wolf Among Us 2 was first announced during The Game Awards 2019, though it had initially been in the works by the original Telltale Games before the studios' closure in 2018. The game was canceled after the shutdown but then restarted by the revived version of Telltale. You can learn the full story of how the new Telltale rose from the ashes of its predecessor by reading this deep-dive feature. \nYou can play The Wolf Among Us 2 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.",

I had a lot to praise about the game in my original review, in which I wrote about the ways that this newest Halo nimbly walks the line between nostalgia for the earlier games and a fresh, modern core. I’ve been surprised that the multiplayer component has kept me so engaged for as many weeks as it has; as many have observed, the small number of map selections and modes can be limiting, but I still find myself coming back for more of that wonderful “dance” of competition that the Halo competitive experience offers in its best moments.

          "description": "Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent is a mobile prequel to the 2018 RPG that launched in Japan in October 2020. It became wildly popular overseas and now Octopath fans in the west will have their chance to see why when the English version arrives this year.\nChampions of the Continent plays similarly to the original title. The turn-based field command system remains but up to eight characters can take the battlefield instead of only four. Naturally, the game retains the original’s signature HD-2D art style. \nStory-wise, the game still takes place on the continent of Osterra. The narrative has three paths starring Herminia the \"Witch of Greed\", Tytos the \"Hero\", and Auguste the \"Playwright\". Each character is on a journey to find wealth, power, and glory, respectively, and whoever you choose acts as a Chosen One fighting against a great evil. Fans of the first Octopath Traveler can expect to bump into familiar faces from that game as well. \nOCTOPATH TRAVELER: Champions of the Continent (English ver.) will launch in North America and Europe in 2022!\n#octopathcotc #オクトラ大陸の覇者https://t.co/S0OlifhWz6 pic.twitter.com/2wPwNMJbhT\nFebruary 8, 2022\nOctopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent is a free-to-play title with microtransactions; new characters are obtained using standard gacha-style mechanics. The game launches on iOS and Android in North America and Europe sometime in 2022 with a closed beta beginning in Spring. New information is expected to drop in “mid-February” on the game’s newly launched Facebook page. \nUntil then, Octopath’s spiritual tactical follow-up Triangle Strategy is on the horizon, releasing on March 4.",

To the north of the game’s newest island, you’ll find a Wind Shrine with a puzzle for you to solve. Solve it and you’ll receive a new Aloy-inspired armor. \nWe are so excited for Horizon Forbidden West from our friends at @Guerrilla! While we wait, today we’ve released a new patch for Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut that repairs a Wind Shrine to the north of Iki Island. Solve the puzzle there to earn an Aloy-inspired surprise... pic.twitter.com/5brcjTvL7o\nFebruary 8, 2022\nAs you can see in the tweet above, solving this new Iki Island Wind Shrine gives protagonist Jin Sakai an armor set that resembles something Aloy might wear in the Horizon games.

To the north of the game’s newest island, you’ll find a Wind Shrine with a puzzle for you to solve. Solve it and you’ll receive a new Aloy-inspired armor. \nWe are so excited for Horizon Forbidden West from our friends at @Guerrilla!

Amazon Games, the publisher bringing Tripod Studios and Smilegate's RPG to the west, has been kind enough to let some of the press in a little early to play on a private server, so I've had my hands on the action-RPG MMO for a few weeks now. Much of the game was in place when I played, although I was missing a very big aspect of it: the broader social component. Because of the small sample size of players, all of my time in the world of Arkesia was by my lonesome. So, for now, I'm not comfortable dropping my final assessment on Lost Ark.

Every wrestling fan knows that the quality of the roster makes or breaks any wrestling game but that's become especially crucial for 2K22. The game arrives in the wake of a pandemic era that saw over 100 wrestlers fired by WWE, leaving fans worried and skeptical about who's left to plug up the holes. \nUsing 2K’s official roster list, as well as combing through trailers and marketing materials, we’ve put together a list of over 70 confirmed superstars for WWE 2K22. It’s worth noting that 2K’s own roster lacks names that have appeared in trailers while other faces have been confirmed via their character portraits instead of an in-game model. We're also sure you can use this list to connect the dots on who will appear that have not been formally announced (Tyler Bate would be lonely without his Mustache Mountain partner, Trent Seven, after all). We’ll update this list as new wrestlers are announced, but here’s how the roster is shaping up so far:\nAJ Styles\nDamien Priest\nKane\nSami Zayn\nNote: Jeff Hardy and Samoa Joe were previously confirmed, but given both have since been released from WWE, there's a good chance they’re no longer in the game.\nWWE 2K22 launches March 11 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.",

It's a moment that set the internet on fire, and has filled Star Wars fans with the belief that anything can happen in these shows.\nOnce a secret character is revealed, toy manufactuers race to get product of that certain someone on shelves. We saw it happen with Grogu, and now the floodgates are opened to create product for Luke Skywalker's big moment.\nLego is one of the first toy companies to capture Luke Skywalker showing us how powerful he has become. The set is called Dark Trooper Attack, and it's scheduled to release on March 1. Along with a hooded Luke Skywalker minifigure, this set comes with three Dark Troopers and is set in a hallway where chaos unfolds. It's a smaller set, consisting of just 166 pieces and a price of $29.99.\nClick here to view embedded media\n \n\nWe know The Mandalorian will be a part of the forthcoming Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga game, but we'll have to wait to see if this particular moment is recreated and gives fans control of Luke in arguably one of his greatest moments.",

We learned more about the game in December of 2020 and then Telltale Games shared some more a year later, shortly after Game Informer’s feature about this new iteration of the studio, its Wolf Among Us sequel, and its upcoming game based on The Expanse went live. \nIf you’re still craving some more information about The Wolf Among Us 2, then you’re in luck because Telltale Games has some more information to share this week. More specifically, the studio has announced a behind-the-scenes look at the game happening this Wednesday, February 9, at 10 a.m. PT/Noon CT/1 p.m. EST. \nGreetings from Fabletown!\n#TWAU2 + more, hosted by @geoffkeighley.\n#TheWolfIsBack pic.twitter.com/n9f9AWkY9i\nFebruary 7, 2022\nAs you can see in the tweet above, we’re all heading back to Fabletown this week.

He then left Capcom to create Tango Gameworks, now owned by Bethesda, which is where Mikami began his new horror series, The Evil Within. After a sequel, the team began work on GhostWire Tokyo, which is set to debut on PlayStation 5 and PC on March 25. \nWhile Mikami’s mind is probably mostly focused on the yokai-filled streets of Tokyo, that didn’t stop him from reminiscing about his most well-known horror series, Resident Evil. In a new interview with Newsweek, Mikami explained that he believes there’s ways Resident Evil 4 could be improved. More specifically, he said if rumors of Capcom’s Resident Evil 4 remake are true, he not …",

          "description": "Pokémon Legends: Arceus was released less than two weeks ago but it’s already a hit. Not only did it review really well – Game Informer gave it an 8.75 out of 10 – but it sold a massive 6.5 million copies in just seven days. A new mystery gift distribution might get more players excited to jump back into the Hisui region, or it might get those on the fence to finally pick up the game. \nNews of this incoming mystery gift distribution event comes by way of Serebii.net, which spotted signage for the event. Serebii notes that the event seems to be exclusive to GameStop and will run from February 25 through March 13. It will give players a Hisuian Growlithe and 20 Feather Balls. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nNow, as some have pointed out on Twitter, this isn’t necessarily the most exciting mystery gift distribution. A Hisuian Growlithe isn’t exactly rare – although for some, finding one could take hours – and 20 Feather Balls won’t cost you too much in-game. However, it doesn’t hurt to receive a free Pokémon and some useful Feather Balls. \nNo further details have been released for the event just yet, but considering there’s still a few weeks before its start, it’s not surprising. As we near the February 25 start date for the mystery gift distribution event, expect more details about it to be revealed. \nWhile waiting for more information, be sure to read Game Informer’s Pokémon Legends: Arceus review and then check out these three new Pokémon Pop! figures recently revealed. Read Game Informer’s 10 tips and tricks to know before starting Pokémon Legends: Arceus after that.\n[Source: Serebii.net] \nHave you been playing Pokémon Legends: Arceus?
