          "description": "Capturing lightning in a bottle again.\nWay back in 2014, Inti Creates—of Mega Man Zero and Mega Man ZX fame—made waves in the action platforming space when it released Azure Striker Gunvolt, a clear successor to its previous work on the Blue Bomber. Though that initial release was kinda similar to older Mega Man games, this franchise has evolved far beyond those roots as new ideas and gameplay concepts have come into the fold. Azure Striker Gunvolt 3 represents the next step on this path of new ideas, and while it isn’t a revolutionary new take on the Gunvolt formula, it offers up a tightly designed and intensely addictive adventure that no fan of the franchise will want to miss out on.\nAzure Striker Gunvolt 3 picks up several years after the events of the second entry and begins by following a new character named Kirin. Kirin is a feisty battle priestess working for a shadow organization that endeavors to contain a new Septimal threat where some Septima users are losing control of their powers and turning into powerful, chaotic dragons. The first dragon that Kirin takes down turns out to be Gunvolt himself, who quickly remembers who he is and joins forces with her to neutralize the remaining dragons and get to the heart of what caused their emergence in the first place.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

I really liked it. Please tell me you're going to be adding voice acting to this because it's screaming for it',\" Gilbert tells me. \"And he said, 'Well, we will if we can find a publisher who'll do it for us.'\" So now Wadjet Eye are publishing, and Gilbert is overseeing the voice recording.\nRead more",

A fresh gameplay trailer, watchable below, only cements that further.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Whether you're up to no good in Red Dead Redemption 2 or stealing from the rich to (sort of) give to the poor in the original Desperados, these temples of cash have long been the scenes of messy shootouts, upturned tables, and big, golden pay-outs. At least when your heist strategy's going according to plan, that is. In an exclusive demo for one of the later levels in Hard West 2, the upcoming sequel to the 2015 turn-based tactics original, Ice Code Games' chief technology officer Mateusz Pilski is starting to feel the heat a bit. The bank is well guarded, with at least half a dozen gunslingers staking out the doors at the front, and untold numbers waiting in hidden nooks and crannies further back. He takes a moment to consider his approach, but he begins his assault with confidence.  \n\"In any XCOM-like, when you see that many enemies and that much firepower, in that good a position, you think, okay, I'm fucked up,\" he tells me. \"In just a second, I will show you how you can use Bravado to totally overturn the situation.\"\nRead more",

Everyone else who plays it seems to build enormous, elaborate, impressively well organised structures that are even kind of beautiful. I build a random pile of crap.

          "description": "It’s kind of remarkable how little we really know about Nvidia’s next gaming graphics cards, the RTX 40 series. AMD are openly working on next-gen, RDNA 3-based Radeon GPUs, and Intel are gearing up for the full launch of their Arc Alchemist cards before the end of summer – yet there’s not been so much as a single presentation slide on Nvidia’s wares. Not the kind of hype-building you’d expect, given how many of the current generation’s best graphics cards have GeForce badges.\r\n\n\r\nArriving to fill that info void are, inevitably, leaks. If you don’t regularly hang out in PC hardware circles, know that there’s a veritable cottage industry of in-the-know insiders: anonymous but widely known tipsters like Greymon55 and kopite7kimi, who’ve shared enough accurate details on previous GPU and CPU launches that at least some of their sources are solid. Recently, unannounced Nvidia cards like the RTX 4070, RTX 4080 and especially the RTX 4090 have become this industry’s hottest commodities, meaning leakers are also the primary source of GeForce details for the gaming tech world at large.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I say all this because Saints Row - not to be confused with Saints Row yet also to be confused with Saints Row - whisked me back to the early 2000s, when I was but a naïve teenager whose life largely pivoted around their Xbox 360. A time when Saints Row and Saints Row 2 were lighthearted Grand Theft Auto alternatives, then Saints Row: The Third came along and cranked up the silliness, and then Saints Row 4 grabbed the lever and cranked it so hard it snapped. So, yes, this year's Saints Row reboot is technically Saints Row 5, except it’s more of a careful reboot. Where does it really sit on the timeline? At both ends, I reckon.\nRead more",

The studio’s latest feels at once unique and distinct – and yet clearly carries that Arkane DNA, which has been fine-tuned with each successive release. It's an ethos encapsulated by the game’s own time loop, in which protagonist Colt Vahn relives the same day again and again as he searches for a way to break free of it - an idea that was, among other things, designed to encourage something hardcore Arkane fans had been doing already – replaying the game over and over again.\nWhile Dishonored had gently suggested repeat playthroughs with its kill/non-lethal runs, plenty of players still called it a day at the end of their first playthrough. Deathloop needed a more direct approach, its developers tell us.\nRead more",

Ever since the first Shelter game where my sweet baby badger got snatched up by the claws of a giant eagle, I’ve learned that these adorable animal games can be pretty ruthless. It’s the maternal connection that gets me, the pang of loss for something you were supposed to protect. It shoots right between the ribs and straight into the heart. Ow.\nEndling - Extinction Is Forever is one such game. You play as a fox mother trying to keep her four cubs alive in a post-apocalyptic world, and from that premise alone it definitely feels like developers Herobeat Studios are deadset on making me cry. After playing through the game in two evenings, Endling didn’t end up being the emotional gut punch I had braced myself for, but its story of scrappy survival did have me reaching for the tissues by the closing credits. What can I say, I see an animal in distress and I’m a weepy mess.\nRead more",

As an owner of two tortoiseshells myself, they've unlocked routes in our house I never knew existed, using the tiny lip of our fridge as a gateway to the top of our kitchen cupboards, bed frames as launch pads to the middle bar of our sash windows (not even the actual window sill, those daft beasts), and don't even get me started on how they managed to get onto the top of our 2cm wide shower rail that one time.\nStray, BlueTwelve Studio's cat 'em up explorathon, puts you in the paws of a similarly savvy feline protagonist. The cat itself is a marvel of digital observation, fully inhabiting all of the best cat-isms I know and love. You can scratch the backs of sofas and knead and shred carpets with alternate squeezes of the trigger buttons, meow at will, lap from dripping water bowls, topple piles of carefully stacked books and push paint cans off the edge of ledges - and, if you leave them idle long enough, they'll stretch and catch flies too tiny to be caught by the human eye. You can also play a mean game of billiards, much to the annoyance of the local robots. I wouldn't go as far as saying it loosened my jaw quite as much as when I first set eyes on Trico from The Last Guardian, all told, but I reckon if BlueTwelve had the same kind of budget and scale as GenDesign and Sony's Japan Studio did back then, then Stray's cat would be every bit the equal of that famous cat-bird-chimera.\nRead more",

          "description": "Spisovatel Cory Doctorow, který se dlouhodobě věnuje svobodné kultuře a kampaním proti DRM, vysvětluje, proč jeho knihy nejsou dostupné v online obchodě s audioknihami Audible, který má na některých trzích prakticky monopol. Audible totiž používá DRM a Doctorow, ani jako autor knih a držitel práv, nemůže zákazníkům legálně umožnit ho obejít. Proto raději audioknihy nechává natáčet a nabízí nezávisle. Ale na platformě ACX provozované Audible se mezitím objevují nelegální, často nekvalitní verze namluvení jeho knih, které mu konkurují.",

          "description": "These cats are quite possibly the antithesis of Stray\nThe countryside holds many secrets. And some of those are probably best left undiscovered. At least, that's what it seems like in The Excavation of Hob's Barrow, an upcoming horror adventure from Cloak and Dagger Games.\nCloak and Dagger are no stranger to horror or adventure, having explored the genres a fair bit in previous games. For The Excavation of Hob's Barrow, though, the studio is teaming up with Wadjet Eye Games as its publisher.\nWadjet Eye was founded by Dave Gilbert and has delivered a number of stellar adventure games, like Unavowed and The Shivah. This pairing up seems like one to watch for anyone who likes some creepy horror.\nThe Excavation follows antiquarian Thomasina Bateman, who's writing a book on the barrows of England. As she explores the countryside and documents the treasures she finds, Bateman is drawn to a small village called Bewlay. Things begin to get stranger and stranger, as the locals seem wary and her assistant never arrives. And then the dreams start.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWRzaySj0MA\nDon't go in the barrows\nWhile horror games are easy to find these days on Steam, folk horror has a bit of a different air to it. Jump scares are easy to find, but a town with some creepy atmosphere and probably some kind of ancient ritual? That's fresh and interesting.\nIt's been quite a week for unusual and interesting horror game reveals. We spotlighted Slay the Princess, an upcoming horror visual novel about a very scary princess, earlier this week. And now Hob's Barrow is adding more incredible art and creepy vibes to the mix.\nSeems like it's a good time ahead for fans of indie horror games. No date's been set yet, but The Excavation of Hob's Barrow is currently planned for a 2022 launch. You can find it on Steam here.\nThe post Search the barrows for hidden horrors in The Excavation of Hob’s Barrow later this year appeared first on Destructoid.",

I am a cat mom, after all, so anything with a cat, let alone as a playable character, is a big win in my book.

          "description": "Gone but not forgotten\nRoblox is one of the most popular video games in the world, but even for those who don't play the game, a single sound effect has transcended into meme culture to become instantly recognizable: the \"oof\" death sound. In the wake of some ongoing licensing issues Roblox has had with sound effects, the team behind the game has announced that the infamous \"oof\" has been removed from the game entirely. They explained in a tweet from the official Roblox Twitter account that they \"created a replacement default sound\" and that they \"plan to expand [their] Avatar Shop with a whole range of both old and new sounds in the future.\"\nhttps://twitter.com/Roblox/status/1552037832578846720\nRoblox's trouble with the licensing for the sound started back in 2020, after the \"oof\" had pervaded online spaces, and video game composer Tommy Tallarico realized that was a sound he created for a game called Messiah. The \"oof\" was removed from Roblox back then as well, but was reintroduced after Tallarico reached an agreement with the developer, so that creators could buy access to the sound for about $1. It seems that the issue resurfaced and they weren't able to settle things this time, much to the dismay of fans who love the \"oof\" sound.\nThe tweet prior to the announcement of the sound's removal discusses the new plan for how sound effects will play a role in Roblox moving forward. The developer stated that they will be getting sounds \"directly from the creators and licensors,\" and that \"users will also be able to customize sounds for their avatars in the same way they customize clothing.\" That sounds like a pretty interesting step forward for the game, but I have to admit it feels like the end of an era with the \"oof\" sound effect being gone.\nThe post Roblox’s iconic “oof” sound effect is removed due to licensing issues appeared first on Destructoid.",

Right behind it is Kirby and the Forgotten Land, followed by Nintendo Switch Sports (which is doing better than some expected it to).\nFrom there we dive into third-party land with Monster Hunter Rise, then are reminded of the raw staying power of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe (which launched in the region in 2014), then we're back to third parties with Overcooked 2, Among Us, and Brave Corps Defeats the Demon King respectively for places six through eight. Then at spots nine and ten we predictably have Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and Zelda: Breath of the Wild, which are hanging on in multiple regions, not just Japan.\nThe rest of the list is a fascinating microcosm of what does/doesn't work in Japan (the Kingdom Hearts cloud versions seem to be doing well, with two showings in the top 30 overall), and reinforces the evergreen nature of many first-party Nintendo games.\nNintendo also has annual rankings here for 2020 and 2021.\n\nNintendo of Japan's \"most downloaded\" Switch charts for the first half of 2022 (Top 10):\nPokemon Legends\nKirby and the Forgotten Land\nSwitch Sports\nMonster Hunter Rise\nMario Kart 8 Deluxe\nOvercooked 2\nAmong Us\nThe Brave Corps Defeats the Demon King\nSmash Ultimate\nZelda: Breath of the Wild\nThe post Pokemon Legends is dominating Nintendo of Japan’s “most downloaded” Switch charts for 2022 appeared first on Destructoid.",

This definitive edition of the vertically scrolling shooter features new levels, alternate enemies, and bullet patterns, as well as several modes including Arcade, Score Attack, and Boss Rush. New Dual Play and Double Play options allow for co-op multiplayer action... and even the option for a single player to control two ships!\nThe visuals have been spruced up to HD quality, while the pulse-pounding score has been fully remixed and re-recorded, offering both new and veteran players the most definitive and electrifying edition of the challenging action title. If you have been waiting on a PC port or a localized release of this title, then you at least know that you won't have too much longer to wait. Better get that trigger finger in gear.\nRaiden IV x MIKADO Remix will launch in the west on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox in 2023. It is available right now on Nintendo Switch.\nThe post Raiden IV x MIKADO Remix headed west on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox appeared first on Destructoid.",

Well, Atlus asked that exact same question, and fans answered: Persona 3.\nThe results came via the Atlus Survey 2022 special program, where they were gathered by Persona Central.\nStuffed into one category (P3/FES/P3P), Persona 3 came out on top, but Persona 2 (Innocent Sin/Eternal Punishment) was right there too with roughly the same percentage of votes, coming in second. After that we have Revelations: Persona (Persona 1), then Persona 4 (+Golden), and Devil Summoner: Raidou rounding out the top five.\nI think I'd go with Persona 1 or Persona 2. The third, fourth, and fifth entries have been celebrated enough: it would be great to unify the entire series and have all five games in a palatable modern context, potentially even by the end of this console generation (or with some form of backward compatibility). With Persona 3-5 already being preserved again, it would round everything out.\nAtlus' Persona remake/Atlus game poll results:\nPersona 3 (P3 / P3FES / P3P) (78.9%)\nPersona 2: Innocent Sin / Persona 2: Eternal Punishment (78.9%)\nRevelations: Persona (76.3%)\nPersona 4 (P4G) (74.8%)\nDevil Summoner: Raidou Kuzunoha series (72.1%)\nDevil Summoner: Soul Hackers (69.5%)\nShin Megami Tensei IV: Apocalypse (66.7%)\nShin Megami Tensei IV (65.3%)\nDigital Devil Saga: Avatar Tuner series (62.4%)\nEtrian Odyssey series (58%)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cISLbrNyg5U\nThe post Persona 2 and 3 won the official Atlus most-requested remake poll appeared first on Destructoid.",

Cena will be dropping onto the landing zone on all platforms July 29, kitted out with his trademark jorts, inflatable finger melee tool, WWE title \"Back Bling,\" and iconic \"You Can't C Me\" taunt. Unfortunately, it does not appear that playing as Cena will afford you the ability to hit your opponents with the Attitude Adjustment.\nI expect Cena to be banned from online play almost immediately given his natural camouflage abilities.\n\nFor those of you who prefer your battle arts of the vehicular persuasion, then Rocket League is also currently feeling the pro-wrestling vibe. From July 28, players can purchase brand-new octane decals for their road rippers of choice. The two new designs are styled after the color schemes and shirt logos of both John Cena and the current Undisputed WWE Universal Champion, Roman Reigns.\nThe WWE SummerSlam Octane Decal Bundle will retail for 500 credits.\n\nFinally, over in the cutesy bean-bashing world of Fall Guys, three new costumes are headed to the in-game store. These outfits are stylized after three top WWE stars: The video game-lovin' Xavier Woods, legendary deadman The Undertaker, and yer boy Moyse's favorite, Asuka. These three skins will be available to purchase within Fall Guys during this week's \"Blundermania\" promotion, which will take place between July 28 and August 1.\nThe post WWE stars headed to Fortnite, Rocket League, and Fall Guys in new crossover events appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Merrie Melodies\nYesterday, Warner Bros. Games launched the open beta for its incoming platform fighter MultiVersus, allowing players on both PC and console platforms to step into the ring with its crossover cast of pop culture characters. Already, the MultiVersus beta has seen incredible success, becoming the fourth most popular title on just the Steam platform alone.\nThe PC dashboard logged an incredible 144,000 players at its peak yesterday, surpassing launch day numbers for any other fighting game on the platform — including Street Fighter, Tekken, and Mortal Kombat. It should be noted, of course, that MultiVersus is a free-to-play title, but that's still a staggering amount of players. When you add in players on Xbox and PlayStation, we could easily be looking at the most popular fighting game beta of all time.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAydKj4j0IA\nOf course, these numbers lead to some particularly sweaty servers, and some players found themselves struggling to log in during Tuesday's peak activity period. A fighting game lives and dies on the longevity of its community, so while these numbers are unlikely to be retained, MultiVersus will be looking to hook in enough regulars to keep the fists and fur flying over the coming weeks, months, and perhaps years — though Player First Games' implementation of crossplay will certainly aid this goal.\nIf you want to check out the slapstick silliness for yourself, then the MultiVersus beta is available on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms right now. All you need do is download the game client on your platform of choice, sign in with a WB Games account, and you're ready to rock.

          "description": "A new report indicates Aspyr has hit some rough waters\nThe Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic could be on an indefinite delay, according to a new investigation. Bloomberg reports that Aspyr Media's KOTOR remake is on hold, after hitting some development troubles.\nThe remake was announced last year, during the PlayStation Showcase 2021. It's in development at Aspyr Media, an Austin-based studio that has built up a portfolio of ports, especially in the Star Wars franchise.\nBloomberg reports that Aspyr has fired the KOTOR remake's art director and design director this month. Following a series of meetings, sources tell Bloomberg that the project is on pause. Aspyr is reportedly looking for new contracts and development opportunities.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lL-RfE-ioJ8\nThis comes after a demo was reportedly finalized at the end of June, showing off a slice of the Knights of the Old Republic remake. Studio heads told staff the slice wasn't where they wanted it to be.\nBloomberg's sources point to two issues, via sources familiar with the matter. One is that the project may not have been sustainable on its current course, given the amount of time and money invested in the demo. The other is the timeline. While Aspyr may have been targeting the end of 2022, according to Bloomberg's sources, a more realistic target would be 2025.\nA galaxy far, far away\nThis news is disheartening for those hoping to see some KOTOR sooner rather than later. Saber Interactive, another studio under the Embracer umbrella, joined on the project earlier this year to assist development. Aspyr announced its intent to acquire Beamdog, which has some RPG talent in tow, in April. The Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake is still officially planned as a timed exclusive for PlayStation 5 and PC.\nNeither Aspyr Media nor Embracer Group immediately responded to Bloomberg.\nThe post The Star Wars KOTOR remake has reportedly been put on hold appeared first on Destructoid.",

He's a square, everything in Minecraft is a square — it just makes sense. Starting today, players can download the SpongeBob SquarePants DLC (as long as they have the latest version of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition installed), and then they're off on their adventures to explore Bikini Bottom like they never have before. The DLC was created in conjunction with Minecraft creators Spark Universe, and this has to be one of the biggest DLC packs I've seen for the game.\nIt comes with over forty skins, a huge map with locations all over Bikini Bottom, minigames, collectibles, and more. Of course, you'll get to visit classic locations like SpongeBob's house, the Krusty Krab, and the Chum Bucket, but the DLC even includes more obscure locations from the show like the Barg'N-Mart, Glove World, and Goo Lagoon. Whether you're frolicking through Jellyfish Fields, defending the Krusty Krab from hungry anchovies, or racing at Mrs. Puff's Boating School, you're likely to have the best day ever. Players can also get a free Character Creator item from now until September 16.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9914FnO95J8\nBased on the sheer amount of content we saw in the trailer alone, this looks like one of the most substantial DLCs for Minecraft I've ever seen. The level of detail in portraying the show's famous episodes is something to behold, and you just know that the creators are really big fans themselves.\nHonestly, it looks like this DLC pack is basically a whole new game in its own right, and could keep you busy for a few dozen hours at least if you do everything. I haven't played Minecraft in a good while, but as someone who grew up with SpongeBob, this release has me thinking I might want to crack open the old account again, for nostalgia's sake.\nThe post SpongeBob SquarePants DLC makes a splash in Minecraft appeared first on Destructoid.",

The adorable Cerberus and Dusa plushes are $32 each, while the three-print Tartarus, Asphodel, and Elysium set is a whopping $179.]\nSupergiant's fantastic action-RPG Hades is custom designed for merchandise, thanks to its attractive visuals, cool aesthetic style, strong colors, and varied cast of memorable characters. Bafflingly, however, Hades gear has been incredibly hard to come by, with nary an art book or pair of Zubaz pants in sight.\nEnter merch-makers Fangamer, who has finally decided, two years after release, to bless fans of Zagreus and his Hades brethren with a fun line of items styled after the game's underworld denizens. While the full line is yet to be revealed, a teaser image appears to include long and short-sleeved shirts, art prints, and a badge set featuring Nyx, Thanatos, Megaera, and, of course, Zagreus himself. No Artemis or Tis, but it's fine.\nhttps://twitter.com/Fangamer/status/1549439138587222016?s=20&t=GrFE6W8m9nXAia2XjKzXrg\nPerhaps best of all, the image features plush dolls of two of The House of Hades' most important employees: three-headed, bone-munching Good Boy Cerberus, and the lovely, hardworking, and ever-fangirling housemaid, Dusa. Better still, the Dusa plush talks! Yes, I will be purchasing both of them.\nHopefully, the full range will include further shirt designs and/or other cool gubbins, but I'm still stunned by the possibility that Hades is yet to receive a lavish, hardcover art book — which seems an absolute given for such a striking-looking release. Regardless, the fun-looking Hades range is set to launch on the Fangamer site on Tuesday, July 26.\nFor my wallet, There is No Escape.\nThe post Hades finally has a merch range, courtesy of Fangamer appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The Meta gets a little more expensive\nThe price of the Meta Quest 2 is going up next month. Today, the VR company announced the Meta Quest 2 virtual reality headset will get a price bump in August, tacking another $100 onto the price tag.\nThis will bring the Meta Quest 2 up to $399.99 for the 128 GB version, and the 256 GB version up to $499.99. Refurbished units and Meta Quest 2 accessories will also see a price increase.\nMeta, a.k.a. Facebook, bought Oculus in 2014 and shifted the naming convention away from Oculus and under Meta in 2021. In today's statement on the pricing change, the company acknowledges VR's momentum, but also cites the cost of production as a concern.\n\"At the same time, the costs to make and ship our products have been on the rise. By adjusting the price of Quest 2, we can continue to grow our investment in groundbreaking research and new product development that pushes the VR industry to new heights.\"\n\nThose who pick up a Meta Quest 2 headset between August 1, 2022 and December 31, 2022 will get a freebie. A copy of Beat Saber will be free to download for 14 days, after they've activated the headset.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTIizcuSdHg\nThe cost of virtual reality\nThis is surprising on a few levels. First, the Quest 2 has been available since 2020. A price hike without a hardware refresh is strange, to say the least.\nBut the Oculus Quest 2, or Meta Quest 2, has been the affordable entry point to virtual reality. Its ability to run wireless or hooked up to a computer is a huge boon. And the price point made it a no-brainer for those looking to get into the technology.\nIt certainly ratchets up the potential appeal of other headsets. For those who already managed to grab a PlayStation 5, the PS VR2 is slowly but surely leading up to its eventual launch.\nThe post Meta Quest 2 VR headsets will get a price hike in August appeared first on Destructoid.",

But what if you aren't all about Sol, what if you're all about the mischievous but thoroughly loveable Jack-O Valentine? Well, fret not, as Apex Toys has also announced that the Halloween lovin' gal is getting her own figure at some point in the near future.\nAs revealed during WonFest 2022, (and reported by Siliconera), the new Jack-O figure is scaled at 1/9, which translates to roughly eight-to-nine inches in height... or at least she would, if she were standing upright. Y'see, Apex Toys has teased the new figure with a suspiciously familiar silhouette, suggesting that our girl will be sporting her back-breaking, censor-worrying, meme-creating, crouch pose — the very same pose that took the internet by storm last year in the form of the \"Jack-O Challenge.\"\nhttps://twitter.com/APEX_TOYS/status/1551013041780559873?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1551013041780559873%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.destructoid.com%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D336431action%3Dedit\nApex Toys did not release any other info in regards to the new Jack-O pose figure, so we don't know the release window, price, or pre-order dates. But given that we don't even get to see an unpainted prototype, or even any new concept art, we are probably still a long way out from having to explain to our friends and relatives why the centerpiece of our lounge is a young woman in a bodysuit and a Halloween mask is essentially... well... \"presenting.\"\nIt's a crouch pose, mom.

That does include Game Pass subscription owners, according to IO Interactive's announcement. The only exception is the Hitman 3 Free Starter Pack, which does not get access to Ambrose Island.\nThe patch rolled out at 9 a.m. ET this morning, on July 26, and is included in the patch. No need to download anything extra from the store.\nAs for what Agent 47 is getting up to in these tropical islands? Well, the opening cinematic released today can give you a clue.

Plus, new starting locations, stashes, and more await.\nThe future of Hitman\nWhile this brings a new locale and likely plenty of mayhem to Hitman 3, there's also more in store.

It seems like the World of Assassination is not quite done with Hitman and Agent 47 yet.

This system hopes to give the wider community a \"heads up\" of sorts on some of the usernames that frequently find themselves blocked from channels.\nThe Shared Ban Info feature is the latest release in Twitch's increasing efforts to clamp down on toxic behavior, derogatory language, hate raids, and personal attacks logged against its huge streamer base. The service recently improved its notification system to signify to banned users exactly why they were banned, while its new Twitch Ban Evasion Tool was instilled in an effort to prevent banned users from returning under new guises.\nOnline toxicity remains one of gaming's biggest and most enduring problems. From headset chatter during online play, to the comment sections of websites, Twitch streams, YouTube videos, and social media accounts, the spreading of hateful, racist, and homophobic language have been emboldened by the general anonymity of the internet, as well as an overall lack of real consequence from the platforms that host the abuse.\nIt is a concern that is likely to continue as long as humans are able to interact with humans in a non-face-to-face capacity.

As a major fan of Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, I was thrilled to see Ubisoft dive back into piracy, this time with a new IP. At that point, Skull and Bones was a 5v5 multiplayer arena battler where you played solely as the ship. It wasn't exactly the Black Flag follow-up many, including myself, had anticipated, but with Ubisoft Singapore, the studio behind the Assassin's Creed franchise's excellent naval combat, at the helm, I wanted to see more. </p>\n\n<p>After another look at it in 2018, Skull and Bones went dark…",

You can pick up a set that includes a “you can’t see me” emote, WWE Championship Title Back Bling, and Five Digit Slapper pickaxe. Personally, I’m chuckling at the idea of the PG-friendly Cena adjusting attitudes with guns instead of bodyslams.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>While Cena isn’t the first wrestler to appear in Fornite – <a href=\"https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/02/03/the-foundation-played-by-dwayne-the-rock-johnson-now-unlockable-in-fortnite\" target=\"_blank\">Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson</a> has him beat there – it’s cool to see regardless, and, as a wrestling fan, I hope this&nbsp;trend continues. Fortnite already acts as the ultimate&nbsp;“forbidden door” for various media properties, so let's throw&nbsp;more sports entertainment into the mix&nbsp;by adding stars from WWE, AEW, Impact, New Japan, and other promotions. That would certainly entice me to dive back into action.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Do you plan on chasing victory royales as Big Match John? Let us know in the comments!&nbsp;</p>",

I reviewed the game a while back – and gave it my <a href=\"https://www.gameinformer.com/review/neon-white/holy-hell\" target=\"_blank\">highest&nbsp;score</a> ever, if you're wondering – but I'm starting a fresh save today, so spoilers should be minimal.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>After that, I'll be picking up where I left off on our ongoing Gunpla build <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1538692939\" target=\"_blank\">from last week</a>. We're building the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=real+grade+wing+gundam&amp;rlz=1C1VDKB_enUS1012US1012&amp;sxsrf=ALiCzsYT6uNhKTWkike_2hPW_dISb43zpA:1658771717524&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjB5fGXzpT5AhVUJX0KHYrSAgMQ_AUoAnoECAIQBA&amp;biw=2560&amp;bih=1321&amp;dpr=1#imgrc=GZQzn5xo5nRRFM\" target=\"_blank\">Real Grade Wing Gundam</a>, and there's still lots to work on.

Given the developers' track record of making games that feature hundreds of playable characters, it's not unreasonable to think this title may unite many popular brands that have gotten the Funko treatment. For now, all we have is a teaser trailer, which you can view above.</p>",

Tabby II\" (the successor to my Palico’s name in Monster Hunter: World); others are more simple, like “Creamsicle,\" which has been growing on me.&nbsp;I’m hoping your responses inspire&nbsp;me to concoct the purr-fect moniker. I'm sorry.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>So let’s hear it: what do you call the cat in Stray? There are no wrong answers. Well, unless you named it “Dog.” Then we’ll have to snitch on you to the Cat Police.

Montreal's character spotlights have given us detailed looks at <a href=\"https://www.gameinformer.com/summer-game-fest/2022/06/09/new-gotham-knights-trailer-shows-off-a-variant-nightwing-suit-and\">Nightwing</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/06/28/robins-gotham-knights-toolkit-includes-teleportation-and-slingshots\">Robin</a>, and now we get a good look at Batgirl's combat prowess in Gotham Knights. In the trailer above, we see her acrobatic maneuvers make short work of a gang. The footage also shows what appears to be a boss fight and a couple of alternate skins that players can unlock for Barbara Gordon.</p>\n\n<p>Slated to release on October 25 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, Gotham Knights tells the story of a Batman-less superhero world and shows how his wards rise to take his place. The playable characters are Robin, Nightwing, Red Hood, and Batgirl. You can play whoever you want, and it won't disrupt the game's cooperative play. Warner Bros. allows two Batgirls to run together, should players wish to attain an Elseworlds vibe.</p>\n\n<p>The skins shown in the video will likely need to be unlocked by finding blueprints and acquiring the proper crafting materials to build them.</p>\n\n<p>Following the success of Rocksteady's Arkham series and Warner Bros. Montreal's contribution, Gotham Knights has enormous shoes to fill. Here's hoping it's every bit as good as the titles mentioned. We need another great Arkham-like game.</p>",

While the story beats will be mostly the same, Naughty Dog has reworked most of the gameplay and visuals.</p>\n\n<p>Along with increased realism in the character models, players can expect seamless transitions between sequences, enhanced enemy and buddy A.I., more breakable objects in combat, accessibility features galore, and even a few new ways to play the game.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to see how far you make it before dying, you can play a new permadeath mode. Naughty Dog has also added a speed run mode to see how quickly players get through the story.</p>\n\n<p>Your time revisiting this amazing game is rewarded with new unlockables, like outfits for Ellie and Joel and a model viewer. The Last of Us Part 1 is slated to release on PlayStation 5 and PC on September 2.</p>\n\n<p>Are you excited to revisit this classic? If so, will you play The Last of Us Part II right after you finish it?</p>",

The first-person action game is built in the Snowdrop Engine, and&nbsp;players control a Na’vi in a new area of Pandora called the Western Frontier. Frontiers of Pandora is being developed by Massive Entertainment, the team behind The Divison.

Shortly after the 1991 launch of the Blue Blur’s debut game on Sega Genesis, his popularity rivaled Nintendo’s behemoth Super Mario franchise. However, much like the roller coasters that inspired Sonic’s original gameplay and level design, the subsequent decades included plenty of highs and lows. Even after a quick jump off the starting line, many feared the series was doomed to fall short of its potential forever.</p>\n\n<p>However, the brand has experienced something of a renaissance in recent years. The Sonic the Hedgehog franchise is perhaps nearly as popular now as when it burst onto the scene just over three decades ago, bolstered by blockbuster movies, beloved comics, and promising streaming shows. Sonic Mania proved a successful retro reinvention, but the core development staff at Sonic Team has yet to deliver the final piece of the puzzle: a mainline game restoring the series’ legacy as one of the premier platformers.</p>\n\n<p>Sega and Sonic Team think they have that final component with Sonic Frontiers. I traveled to Burbank, California, the American headquarters of Sonic Team, to sink hours into the upcoming open-world game to see if it truly is the fresh direction the franchise needs.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gameinformer.com/feature/cover-story/sonic-frontiers/brave-new-world\">Read more...</a></p>",

Players can spacewalk on exterior walkways on their ship, which will provide views of the denser, more varied asteroid fields. Constructing manufacturing facilities lets players produce food and other resources, and you can construct other massive structures upon your capital ship. Perhaps the coolest of all is the ability to collect dreadnaught-sized aliens known as living frigates. Check out the trailer below for a glimpse of these features and others.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameBorder=\"0\"  allow=\"autoplay\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://players.brightcove.net/694940074001/rydylbNsz_default/index.html?videoId=6309770016112\"></iframe>\n\n<p>Endurance goes live today in all versions of No Man’s Sky.

Much of the design is dated, and I wanted to drop it after a few bosses to avoid the mundanity, but I’m happy I saw it to completion. There are many fun moments, and I love how unafraid it is to be strange or referential. Those who are already invested in the tale of Travis Touchdown should be right at home in this new No More Heroes. Still, I’d insist newcomers try out previous entries before diving into this Garden of Insanity.”</p>",
