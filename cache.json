He’s been taken down a hundred floors crawling with goblins, spiders, traps, and other awful things, and you’ll need to overcome it all if you wish to save him. Narrative is kept to a minimum here, but brief vignettes that play out every few floors when you nap by a bonfire help to give you a sense of the world and why your brother felt the need to sacrifice himself.\nGameplay has been compared to a dungeon crawler, but this is really a puzzle game with swords ‘n’ sorcery set dressing. Every floor of the dungeon is laid out in a grid-like fashion, and the goal is to figure out how to reach the next set of stairs safely, often necessitating you game out precisely how to dispatch of any foes and avoid triggering obstacles along the way. In this way, it’s not the kind of thing where you’ll be testing your skills or dexterity much—the emphasis here is more on forming the plan than executing it.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "The Stanley Parable is a game about a man who leaves his desk one day to discover that all of his most difficult to animate colleagues have vanished. First released in 2011 as a Half-Life 2 mod, it is a wild fantasy about what it might be like to not be in front of the computer for a while. There’s also some bonus themes in here about determinism in narrative fiction and the illusion of choice, framed as a satire of contemporary game design, but also as an incisive commentary on the notion of free will in general.\r\n\n\r\nBut most of all, I think that The Stanley Parable is a game about not being in front of the computer for a little while, as a treat. There’s an achievement you get for not playing the game for five years, and in The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe – a remastered version for consoles that adds some new content – there’s another achievement for ten. If they could implement an achievement for feeding all of your worldly belongings into a woodchipper and staggering naked into the forest to live with the animals, they probably would.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I've given myself the span of a fairly short post to try and convince you, dear reader, to give Rocket Bot Royale a shot. It looks like a browser-based game, and it is. It looks like it's probably not worth anyone's time except schoolkids playing on computers in the IT department during their lunch breaks. But goodness me, is there more going on here than meets the eye.\nAs I've made abundantly clear ever since I joined RPS, battle royales are my jam. I'll happily bulk out my Steam library with reams of half-baked ideas and clunky combat systems in the hopes of finding the next big time-sink for me and my squadmates to get lost in over the next several months. I fully expected Rocket Bot Royale to be left at the bottom of my most played games on Steam list after a few weeks, but after a few hours of play, I'm starting to think eventually it might arrive at the top. It's Worms, but with tanks. It's free to play. And I absolutely cannot stop playing it.\nRead more",

It's good to hear that Yuri Lowenthal and Cissy Jones are back on voice duties, presumably as Trevor and his new pal, after their top-notch performances in Call Of The Sea.\nRead more",

It's a game about bending and distorting shapes by applying mathematical transformations, starting with a simple flat sheet and aiming to replicate elaborate 3D shapes which look like blown glass sculptures. It's done cleverly and simply by dragging shapes through zones which distort them in real time but alas, I myself am simple too. Some of the shapes I've accidentally made in Tandis are downright reality-breaking.\nRead more",

          "description": "Midnight Ghost Hunt is the latest in a steadily lengthening line of Prop Hunt-inspired party games. There are two teams: the Ghosts, and the Hunters. The Ghosts can possess objects in the world to hide inside, and their job is to survive until midnight. The Hunters must use a variety of high-tech gadgets and weapons to track down and destroy the Ghosts before that time, or else risk being hunted themselves once midnight strikes.\nThe game is already out on Steam Early Access, and has been for a few weeks now. You’ll probably know already whether you’d be interested in giving it a go: after all, it’s Prop Hunt. But it’s also got a fair few more bells and whistles than other Prop Hunt-likes that I’ve come across. So, a group of us decided to get together one chill winter’s eve (sunny Friday morning actually, but hey, I’m tryna set a spooky tone), and bash each other’s heads with inanimate objects for a few hours. And judging from all the yelps and shouting, I’d say we had a good time.\nRead more",

There was a Mindflayer statue on hand as well, for fans to pose with next to their official cosplayers, and a little campfire for attendees to have a small sit down on, just like they'd do when resting in the game.

No, no, far better to close the curtains 'gainst the cruelties of nature, and stare at a reassuringly solid screen instead. Here's what we're clicking on this weekend.\nRead more",

Instead of plonking ourselves in the middle of the empty show floor after hours, we snuck back into Devolver's booth to film our Friday catch-up, where we started our day some 10 hours beforehand. We got the lowdown on McPixel 3 from solo dev Sos Sosowski, and marvelled once again at the lovely overgrown arcade cabinets of reverse citybuilder Terra Nil. We then moved over to the Focus stand to play supernatural cowboy slayer Evil West and the ultra fast FPS Warstride Challenges. We also stopped by the Pinny Arcade communtiy meet-up today, and sat in on a couple of panels, including one about the history of PC hardware modding and a Wordle Royale. Find out exactly what that means in the video below.\nRead more",

It's only a matter of time before I end up recommending one here, since they're often pretty good, but Approaching Infinity has got there first because it's not only good, it's doing things completely differently.\nIt's a free-roaming space game about exploring, trading, fighting, and doing questy things. But instead of copying Elite wholesale, it merely borrows some parts, and combines them with a classic roguelike framework, and lovingly paints the result with a huge dose of Star Trek. If your eyebrows just did a thing, I'd be very surprised if you don't enjoy it.\nRead more",

The Glaivier features two skill sets, Focus and Flurry, linked to one of the ridiculously huge pointy sticks she wields: spear for fast attacks in Focus and glaive for sweeping hits in Flurry. Smilegate say a successful Glaivier can maximise their effectiveness by building up energy with one skill set for a stat boost when swapping to the other.

It's a standalone handheld console that fits into the palm of your hand (yes, even palms as small as mine), and is controlled via a d-pad, two face buttons and its unique, standout feature, the crank. But inside this dinky yellow wafer, the spirit of PC gaming has never been stronger. It's there in its eclectic first season of indie games, a series of 24 titles that not only delight in the minutiae of its hardware but are delivered weekly for free in batches of two direct to your console over Wi-Fi. It's there in the openness of the Playdate ecosystem, too, where you can make your own Playdate games in its browser-based Pulp creation tool, download the source code, share it with friends (or sell it) and sideload it onto your Playdate all in a matter of minutes. Heck, Panic have even added the ability to stream from it, capture video and screenshots from it, and hook it up to an external monitor, keyboard or controller via its Playdate Mirror app.\nIt's a surprisingly versatile bit of kit, the Playdate, and one I feel will enchant and enthral anyone who has a deep and inherent love of all things games. Sure, there's every possibility it may end up as another Ouya-style disaster show, but if you've ever longed for something like Lexaloffle's Pico-8 platform to be more than just a 'fantasy console', then the Playdate is exactly what you've been waiting for. \nRead more",

          "description": "Last week AMD began shipping the much anticipated Ryzen 7 5800X3D as their first 3D V-Cache consumer CPU and their claims to be \"the world's fastest PC gaming processor\" in being able to outperform even the Core i9 12900K / 12900KS for Windows gaming. We weren't seeded by AMD for this launch, leading us to anticipate that it's not too good for Linux gaming / not their target market. But after the great success I've had with AMD Milan-X performance on Linux, I was very eager to try out this consumer CPU with the 3D-stacked L3 cache and ended up purchasing a 5800X3D. Indeed the Ryzen 7 5800X3D turned out to be disappointing for Linux gaming performance but the 5800X3D was very interesting for a range of other technical workloads and making me very excited for future Ryzen CPUs with 3D V-Cache.",

          "description": "Disney fans, take note. Today, Gameloft announced a new free-to-play life-simulation adventure game called Disney Dreamlight Valley. In it, you brush shoulders with various Disney and Pixar characters, creating your own avatar and life in their magical world. The adventure challenges you to uncover the mysteries of Dreamlight Valley, where its inhabitants have lost their memories due to an event called The Forgetting. You must solve the case and restore the now desolate place to its former glory, putting your own mark on it in the process.\nThe reveal trailer above should give you a taste of the experience, where you enter classic Disney and Pixar worlds and help iconic characters get back their memories. A big bonus? You'll also be designing your own villages with various Disney items and customization options, from Frozen-inspired antique kitchen designs for your abode to princess-inspired ballgowns for your avatar.\nDuring your journey, you can interact with and befriend popular franchise characters who have their own unique story arcs. The press release confirms familiar faces will appear from The Lion King, The Little Mermaid, Toy Story, and Moana. It also promises fun activities like cooking Disney-themed dishes alongside Remy from Ratatouille, fishing with Goofy, and growing vegetables from Wall-E's garden patch. \nThis summer, the game enters Early Access, which you can join by purchasing a Founders Pack or by being an Xbox Game Pass member. As an early adopter, you get to not only provide feedback to the development team but you'll also earn exclusive awards, which will carry over when the full game releases. Disney Dreamlight Valley is currently set for an official launch in 2023 for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, PC, and Mac. \nFor more information, you can visit the official site here. And stay tuned for impressions from our demo of the game, which will go live tomorrow.",

          "description": "From Software released a new patch today that fixes a Malenia bug that unintentionally made the boss fight much harder. \nDubbed Update Version 1.04.1, this patch fixes a bug with the Malenia, Blade of Miquella boss fight in Elden Ring’s endgame that allowed her to heal herself at any time if you were in online co-op. This was a problem because Malenia is only supposed to self-heal upon damaging you, in a vampiric way. That she was able to self-heal at really any time was causing quite the conundrum for players looking to defeat her, who is already arguably the most challenging boss in the entire game. This new patch fixes that fortunately, and it brings with it a few other fixes too. \n\n\nHere’s what Update Version 1.04.1 brings to Elden Ring: \nFixed a bug in which the effect duration of the Cerulean Hidden Tears was revised downward\nFixed a bug with Malenia, Blade of Miquella in which her HP was not healed correctly in the online multiplayer environment\nFixed a bug that causes some bosses to die at unintended times.\nFixed a bug that prevented the boss “Elden Beast” from working properly under certain circumstances\nFixed some texts\n“The version number of this update shown at the lower right corner of the Title Screen will be as follows: App Ver. 1.04.1, Regulation Ver. 1.04.2,” the patch notes read. \nAs expected, in order to play online in Elden Ring, you must have this update installed. For more about the game, read Game Informer’s Elden Ring review and then check out this story about an Elden Ring player who used mods to enter the closed colosseum, where once inside, they discovered a Site of Grace and two enemies. Read about a recent update that adjusted sorcery, incantation, and weapon skill balancing after that. \nHave you beaten Malenia yet? Let us know in the comments below!",

I recall booting up the wacky sports simulator at my sister’s apartment and joyously swinging my Remote/Nunchuk to hit a baseball, throw a quick jab, or swing a golf club. So, it feels serendipitous that I’m reviewing Switch Sports 16 years later. Diving into the second sequel’s six activities alone and with friends (locally) has been a fun, nostalgic rush. I haven’t had access to the game's online multiplayer component, which, as you can imagine, houses a bulk of Switch Sports’ content. So, while I can’t talk about ranked progression, the cosmetic/currency systems, and exclusively-online modes, here are my thoughts on everything else. \nOf course,…",

          "description": "Matt Reeves’ The Batman is getting a sequel, to probably nobody’s surprise. \nNot only did the movie do really well at the box office, especially as the silver screen continues to struggle to bounce back amidst the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic, but it was well-received by both critics and fans alike. Now, DC has confirmed that The Batman will get a sequel with Matt Reeves returning to write and direct and Robert Pattinson set to reprise his role as the Caped Crusader, as reported by Variety. \nThe publication notes that this was announced last night during Warner Bros. CinemaCon presentation and while the company revealed a sequel is happening, not much else was shared. As for a villain or storyline, we’re all still just as in the dark as we were before the sequel was revealed. However, those who have seen The Batman, which is now streaming on HBO Max for subscribers, there are a number of threads the sequel could move forward with, both in terms of potential villains and potential storylines. We won’t spoil those threads here, but The Batman sequel seems to be heading in a certain direction. \nThe Batman hit theaters last month, raking in $134 million domestically, Variety reports, and its ticket sales still represent the biggest opening weekend for any movie in 2022. Today, its global box office sits around $759 million, making it the highest grossing movie of the year thus far (although Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness is eyeing that throne). \nWhile waiting for a sequel to The Batman, read Game Informer’s coverage of two upcoming DC games, Gotham Knights and Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League. \n[Source: Variety]\nWhat villains would you like to see in a sequel to The Batman?

          "description": "Sega has announced plans to delist the digital versions of the classic Sonic games that will be included in its upcoming Sonic Origins collection.\nSonic the Hedgehog 1, 2, 3 & Knuckles, and CD will be removed from online storefronts on May 20, a little over a month before the June 30 launch of Sonic Origins. There will be two exceptions. The Sega Ages versions of Sonic 1 and 2 for Switch will remain playable. The same immunity applies to Sonic 2 on the Sega Genesis library for the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack.\nSega has not cited a reason for this move, but the publisher evidently wants to steer players towards Origins if they want their classic Sonic fix. Rockstar Games made a similar move when it delisted the PC versions of the Grand Theft Auto games that appeared in last year’s ill-fated Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – Definitive Edition. The decision earned significant backlash from fans before the collection launched, as many felt Rockstar was limiting their options for purchasing the classic entries. That situation further backfired due to the Trilogy’s botched release, and Rockstar eventually restored the standalone GTA titles to PC storefronts. \nSonic Origins bundles remastered versions of the Genesis-era platformers. It boasts enhancements such as new and improved animations, new gameplay modes, and the option to play as Tails/Knuckles in each game, among other features. It’s slated to arrive on PlayStation and Xbox platforms, Switch, and PC. The game comes in two editions – a $39.99 standard version and a $44.99 Deluxe – with a few content packs that you can read about here.",

          "description": "Epic Games has announced that the next artist in its Soundwave Series, which sees artists from around the world perform on creative islands, is rapper Emicida. \nEmicida is one of the biggest rappers in Brazil, and his performance will begin Friday, April 29, at 6 p.m. EST. It will repeat non-stop for 72 hours until Monday, May 2, at 6 p.m. EST. To accompany Emicida’s performance, the Keep Going Lobby Track and Triumphant Emote will be available in the Fortnite Item Shop starting this Thursday, April 28, at 8 p.m. EST. Upon completing Emicada’s experience, you’ll receive some XP and the Soundwave Series – Emicada Spray as a memento from the show. \nAs for what to expect beyond the actual performance, you’ll find a creative island inspired by Emicida’s life journey and how it influenced his music, made by community creators BertBuilds, Paradox Builds, and Zen Creative. \n“The setlist, which includes some of Emicida’s biggest hits, tells the story of how he grew up in Jardim Cachoeira in the north of São Paulo, Brazil, and became one of the most popular rappers in Brazil and a successful artist worldwide,” an Epic Games blog post reads. “In the experience, Emicida shares a bit of his path as a rapper, from where he was doing street rap battles to becoming recognized internationally.” \n\nPlayers will have the option to watch the show via Picture-in-Picture while playing other Creative Experiences, Battle Royale, and more if they don’t want to experience it on the creator-built island. However, Epic Games says this is available only during certain times of the event. It can be accessed through the game’s settings, but interactive elements will not be playable if the experience is viewed through Picture-in-Picture. \nFor more about Emicida’s Soundwave Series event, read the full Epic Games blog post. \nAre you excited to see Emicida perform?

          "description": "Players suspect that a closed colosseum in Elden Ring could be the location for a potential PvP-based DLC or expansion. Popular From Software modder Lance McDonald was able to look inside it with a mod. He confirmed that the colosseum’s outer walls aren’t just set dressing but actual walls to an arena. \nAs reported by Video Games Chronicle, another From Software modder, Sekiro Dubi, used a mod to enter the colosseum and explore it even further. Surprisingly, Sekiro Dubi discovered not just a colosseum to explore, but two additional Elden Ring enemies and even a new Site of Grace, which are Elden Ring’s version of Dark Souls' bonfires. \n\n\nAs noted by VGC, the Site of Grace seems to indicate that this area was reachable within the game at one point or another, unless, of course, this Site of Grace will become reachable one day in a patch or DLC that allows players into the colosseum. Sekiro Dubi notes in their video above that the Site of Grace is called “?PlaceName?” (an obvious placeholder name) in the locations menu, but they point out that leaked Network Test files point to it being called Leyndell Colosseum. \nAs far as new enemies go, there’s a Gladiator Large and an Old Lion of the Arena, neither of which can be found elsewhere in Elden Ring. Sekiro Dubi notes that in-game lore indicates that this colosseum was a place where warriors fought against beasts. \nFor now, this colosseum remains inaccessible to the standard playerbase as it’s only reachable via mods. However, many speculate that it will become a PvP arena someday. Only time will tell. \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer’s Elden Ring review and then check out this story about how Elden Ring was the best-selling game in the U.S. for the second month in a row. Read about the latest Elden Ring patch that adjusts sorcery, incantation, and weapon skill balancing after that. \n[Source: Video Games Chronicle]\nDo you want the colosseum to become a PvP-based arena?

          "description": "With Apex Legends Season 12 coming to a close, fans have been eagerly waiting for news about the next chapter in Respawn’s battle royale and what it has to offer. A cinematic trailer dropped yesterday, revealing the game’s next defensive legend, Newcastle, while showcasing Titanfall Spectres and feral wildlife along Storm Point’s tropical beaches. You can watch the footage below. \n\n\nApex loremasters might already know that Bangalore has a friendly rivalry and close relationship with her older brother, Jackson. While protecting Bangalore during the Battle of Gridiron, Jackson is presumed KIA. We join Bangalore after some time has passed; she’s announced her retirement from the Apex Games. At the same time, a masked defender named Newcastle is slated to be her replacement. Of course, explosive hijinks ensue while the two squad up for Bangalore’s final battle royale match. Bullets whiz past faces, grenades leave craters in the sand, and Titanfall Spectres ambush our favorite legends while they slay a massive beast. Bangalore is surprised to learn the truth behind Newcastle’s mysterious identity by the end of it all.\nSeason 13 “Saviors” might shift up the meta with the inclusion of Newcastle. While the terminology for the character’s abilities isn't clear, it’s safe to assume that he’ll keep his teammates safe with well-timed fortifications. According to speculation, he might even be able to drag downed allies out of the fight while reviving them. If this holds, then we’re in for significant changes in the casual and competitive levels of play. \nAre you excited about Season 13? What rank are you currently in for Season 12?

This announcement came by way of a rather odd tweet from the Nintendo of America account that seems to indicate the news comes straight from Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto himself. \nThis is Miyamoto. After consulting with Chris-san, my partner at Illumination on the Super Mario Bros. film, we decided to move the global release to Spring 2023–April 28 in Japan and April 7 in North America. My deepest apologies but I promise it will be well worth the wait.\nApril 26, 2022\nThe Illumination Twitter account released the news at the same time last night with a similar message. \n“Miyamoto-san and I have been collaborating on all aspects of the Super Mario Bros. film and, together with our partners at Universal, have decided to move the global release to Spring 2023 – April 7 in North America and April 28 in Japan. We are excited to share this incredible film with you.” \nAs you can see, neither company lists a definitive reason for the delay, but it seems like the movie simply needed some additional time in the oven. Considering that this is Nintendo’s first significant foray into animated silver screen features and how big the Mario brand is, it makes sense to take all the time needed to make this movie the best it can be. \nReports from November of last year indicated that Nintendo was happy with the film thus far. Miyamoto reportedly even hinted that more movies based on Nintendo properties could be on the way. While waiting to see if that becomes true, check out the complete cast list for this Super Mario Bros. film. \nAre you excited about this movie? Let us know in the comments below!",

As Eurogamer reported at the time, Project Q was one of four codenamed titles listed by Ubisoft, who issued a DCMA takedown of the list once it hit online.  \nThe French publisher confirmed Project Q’s existence on Twitter on Saturday, stating that the game is in early development and that players can register for upcoming gameplay tests. The timeframe for these tests is unknown. Ubisoft subsequently clarified in the same Twitter thread that Project Q is not a battle royale and will feature several PvP modes. It also states there are no plans to add NFTs to the game, evidently a concern given Ubisoft’s enthusiastic foray into the concept with its ill-received Quartz platform. \nSo, we heard you heard... 🤷\nhttps://t.co/TMRKwiUzbJ pic.twitter.com/hZ40OkPdum\nApril 23, 2022\nLeaked playtest footage from Exputer shows a couple of matches from the game.

It does not have a release window.  \nIn other recent Ubisoft news, several private firms are apparently looking to acquire the publisher.

          "description": "We've emerged from the depths of the BioShock series to begin a fresh season of Video Gameography! We're doing things differently this time as we're discussing the gameography of a developer rather than covering an individual game series. That studio is Supergiant Games, acclaimed indie developer of Bastion, Transistor, Pyre, and Hades. We kick things off by examining their debut outing, Bastion.\nBastion launched on Xbox Live Arcade on July 20, 2011, and was created by a ragtag team of seven friends that formed the core of Supergiant (all of whom remain at the studio today). Developed under two years entirely in co-founder Amir Rao's father's living room, Bastion gave the upstart team a chance to create the game of their dreams after spending years working for triple-A studios. We'll discuss Bastion's unorthodox development cycle (it had no pre-production phase), the origins of beloved elements such as its narrator and soundtrack, and how the game's success launched Supergiant into stardom.  \nJoin hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), John Carson (@John_Carson), and Prima Games staff writer Jesse Vitelli (@jessevitelli) for an entertaining and informative chat about the history and narrative of Bastion! You can also decide which one of us does the best narrator impression.  \nIf you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com.

As a robed figure, you must unite a population shunned by the gods by restoring their primary connection: language.\nThe core of the experience involved decoding ancient languages to communicate with the Tower of Babel's silent residents and solve puzzles. The reveal trailer also showed off more traditional environmental puzzle-solving as well as some stealth; Chants of Sennar is a war of words, rather than fists. The game’s sharp art direction and a relaxing soundtrack lend the game both a soothing and mysterious atmosphere. \n\n\nChants of Sennaar is slated to arrive in 2023 for Switch and PC.",

Episode one saw an exciting introduction to both the iconic Spartans and the brutal Covenant forces that seek to tear humanity apart. \nBut then we got weeks of melodrama and ill-paced storylines that made us question if we wanted to continue with the show. Episode five, titled \"Reckoning,\" is a stark reminder of why this series has so much potential, and we're breaking it all down on this special edition of The Game Informer Show!\n\n\nJoin Alex Stadnik and Andrew Reiner as they bring on Kate Sanchéz, EIC and entertainment critic for But Why Tho?, to discuss and spoil the fantastic battle and more from this week's entry in the Paramount Plus series. We start the proceedings off by gauging Kate's level of enjoyment for the show and blow through some of the other less exciting plot points to get to the good stuff.\nWe also touch on the thankfully brief encounters with Soren and Kwan as they trek through the desert, en route to Madrigal. While that storyline continues to suffer, it wasn't much of a deterrent, as the panel all walked away from this week's show excited for what's to come.\nProgramming Note: Our Episode six review will premiere on Monday, May 1, instead of the regular Friday timeslot. This is due to a particular video editor and his need to take a vacation. We appreciate your patience and look forward to continuing the series review!\nWhat do you think about Halo thus far? Be sure to let us know in the comments below. We'd also love your feedback on the extra GI Show episodes. Do you like them? Do you want to see us focus on games or the Marvel shows in the future?

As for how this fight plays into the actual battle royale that is Call of Duty: Warzone, that remains unclear. Save for one of the Warzone planes going down after being grabbed out of the sky by King Kong, the soldiers we play as in the game are nowhere to be seen.\nYou can check out the teaser trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nOperation Monarch will go live on May 11, but hopefully before then, we learn more about how Godzilla and King Kong will actually affect Call of Duty: Warzone. Perhaps they’ll replace the ever-enclosing circle, or perhaps they’ll just be fighting in the background. Regardless, here’s hoping we get some cool skins and customization options related to the kaiju out of this. \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer’s Call of Duty: Vanguard review and then read about how a Call of Duty: Modern Warfare sequel and new Warzone game are confirmed for 2022.

These three games join the recently-added Sega Genesis games, Altered Beast, ToeJam & Earl, Dynamite Headdy, Sword of Vermilion, and Thunder Force II, as well as Banjo-Kazooie, which was added to the service back in January. You can check out all three new Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack games in the trailer below: \n\n\nSpace Harrier II\nSpace Harrier II was first released in 1988 and was one of the original launch titles for the Mega Drive (what the Sega Genesis was known as in Japan) and one of the six Sega Genesis launch titles in the U.S. Nintendo says Space Harrier II is “a celebrated launch title for the Genesis/Mega Drive,” and that “in this sequel to the popular 3D shoot-em-up, Harrier takes to the skies once more to defend Fantasy Land from a mysterious invader.” \nShining Force II\nShining Force II is a tactical RPG released in 1993 and while it is a sequel for the franchise, it’s not a direct sequel to the first shining force. Nintendo says this “second entry in the popular tactical-RPG series” features “even more strategic combat.” In it, “Sir Astral’s squire, Bowie, must assemble an army of light from all the world’s races to stop evil from overtaking the land.” \nSonic The Hedgehog Spinball\nSonic The Hedgehog Spinball is the first of the pinball-related spinoffs in the Sonic franchise. Originally released for the Mega Drive in 1993, Nintendo says “the world’s fastest hedgehog bursts onto the pinball scene in an all-new adventure,” and that “in this action pinball game anyone can pick up and enjoy, gather the Chaos Emeralds, and save four worlds from Dr. Robotnik.” \nAre you excited about any of these Sega Genesis games?

The company announced today a popular Borderlands spinoff is returning this year with the return of Tales from the Borderlands.\nIn a tweet this afternoon from the Borderlands official Twitter account, it was revealed that Tales from the Borderlands would be receiving a second season, and Gearbox only lists it and 2K Games as being attached to the project. The tweet reads, \"There are more stories to explore in the Borderlands universe. An all-new Tales from the Borderlands adventure is coming in 2022 from @GearboxOfficail and @2K. Stay tuned for a full announcement this summer.\" The message came with a piece of art featuring three characters under the Borderlands logo with a big moon shining in the background.\nThere are more stories to explore in the #Borderlands universe. An all new Tales from the Borderlands adventure is coming in 2022 from @GearboxOfficial and @2K.\npic.twitter.com/xsFbRZ5eHo\nApril 21, 2022\nThe previous developer for season one of Tales of the Borderlands, Telltale Games, isn't mentioned in the announcement, which makes sense as that company has taken more of a publishing role since it was shuttered and resurrected over the past few years. It's unknown whether this new edition of Tales from the Borderlands will continue on with characters from the first season or move on to other stories within the universe. \nSeason one of Tales of the Borderlands is an adventure game following the exploits of former Hyperion employee Rhys and con artist Fiona in the rough yet humorous world of Pandora.

Following the reveal of the expansion, which takes place in the mysterious Dragon Isles and looks ripe for adventure, I was able to sit down with senior game designer Jackie Wiley and associate art director Tina Wang to talk about all things Dragonflight, including the new class/race combination Dracthyr Evokers.\nThe Dragon Isles have been in the vocabulary of longtime WoW players as the home to the powerful dragon aspects and their dragonflights prior to the Burning Legion's invasion of Azeroth 10,000 years ago.

The game is a multiplayer take on Level-5 and Studio Ghibli’s whimsical universe made by developer Netmarble, and you can pre-register for free on mobile devices beginning today. \n\n\nCross Worlds boasts a new story and the signature Studio Ghibli animation style from the first two titles (the game is made in Unreal Engine 4). The narrative centers on the player character, who hails from a futuristic city, playing what they believe to be a virtual reality game called Soul Divers. However, they discover the fantasy world they’ve entered is very much real, and a mysterious girl named Rania tasks you with rebuilding her world’s kingdom to save both of your realities. \nPlayers suit up as one of five classes: Swordsman, Witch, Engineer, Rogue, and Destroyer. You’ll explore an expansive world filled with NPCs to befriend and monsters to slay, as well as collect Familiars that can be tamed to fight alongside you. The Kingdom can be built up and decorated using interactive objects along with maintaining your own personal farm. Multiplayer includes both PvE and PvP modes.  \nPre-registering on the App Store or Google Play gets you the Explorer’s Outfit. Joining the game’s Discord nets you the Catarumpus Hat and a special title. \nNi no Kuni: Cross Worlds is slated to release stateside on iOS and Android in early summer.

Publisher Dotemu also brings exciting news that the Turtles' original voice actors from the 1987 cartoon reprise their roles in Shredder’s Revenge. The action gets another big dose of nostalgia with Cam Clarke (Leonardo), Townsend Coleman (Michelangelo), Barry Gordon (Donatello), and Rob Paulsen (Raphael) spouting one-liners in the midst of battle as a result. \n\n\nThose attending PAX East this week have the opportunity to play Shedder’s Revenge for the first time at Dotemu’s expo hall booth (#12043, if you’re curious). The rest of us will have to wait to play the game on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. Dotemu announced that Limited Run Games will produce physical copies of the digital-only title sometime after launch.

This will be the first time these cyberpunk-fantasy RPGs have ever been released on console, having been previously exclusive to PC. The trilogy includes three games, as the name suggests: the original PC game, Shadowrun Returns, Shadowrun: Dragonfall – Director’s Cut, and Shadowrun: Hong Kong – Extended Edition, all fully remastered. \n\n\n“The Shadowrun Trilogy, a remastered release of the Shadowrun Returns RPGs originally released by Harebrained Schemes, has been updated for a console experience, with upscaled graphics, improved performance, and controller-optimized gameplay,” a press release reads. “All three titles in the series will launch simultaneously for the Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5, and are available for preorder on all platforms as of today.” \nShadowrun Returns was originally funded via Kickstarter in just 28 hours, and it was the first Kickstarter-funded game to launch after raising more than $1 million on the fundraising platform, according to the press release. Shadowrun Returns, and the rest of the trilogy, is based on the Shadowrun tabletop RPG created by Jordan Weisman, who also helped design Shadowrun Returns. \nShadowrun Trilogy will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Switch on June 21 and it will cost $39.99. \nFor more, read Game Informer’s reviews of Shadowrun Returns, Shadowrun: Dragonfall, and Shadowrun: Hong Kong. \nAre you excited for this remastered release of the Shadowrun Trilogy?
