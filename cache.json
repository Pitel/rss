It's a follow-up to a little-known open-world adventure that, as we understand, was much loved by the few who bothered to play it back in 2017...\nAh, we can't keep that up. Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is finally with us! We're only a few days after launch and despite the plentiful coverage you've no doubt caught here and elsewhere — TOTK really has taken over the internet, it seems — we're still tip-toeing around spoilers and unsure how much to discuss with each other right now. Have you got to the bit with the... thing that grants you the ability to... erm, get to the top of... things?

One that we have caught today, however, is a little more heartwarming than most (thanks, VG247).\nLet's clear this up first: we are going to be mentioning certain Tears of the Kingdom plot points here as well as the events of the Champions' Ballad DLC for BOTW.

So wonderful has this art been, in fact, that we felt it was only right to share some of it with you lovely lot, bringing us neatly onto this stunning hand-drawn journal by artist and game developer @stepickford.\nFormally of Rare and Software Creations, Pickford worked on several titles for the NES and SNES such as Ironsword: Wizards & Warriors II and Ken Griffey Jr. Presents Major League Baseball. The dev has since proven his artists' touch in different ways — you might remember Pickford's Elden Ring journal from last year, recording his game playthrough with wonderful inky sketches to mark his progress. Now, he is doing the same for Tears of the Kingdom, and after a weekend of playing, we can see how the project is going so far.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It also beat out its predecessor, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, by a staggering 173% and is already the fourth biggest Zelda game of all time in revenue, sitting just behind The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.

There are some buck wild concepts in Square Enix’s game, including fourth wall breaks to manipulate characters' actions and literally muting someone by turning voices off in the options menu, to name just two of the wackier features (and a big plot twist is discussed in this article, so beware if you're planning on playing Paranormasight soon). \r\n\n\r\nAt the outset, though, Paranormasight loks like it is your average visual novel, with the player working away to prevent curses from claiming the lives of Tokyo citizens. Writer and director Takaya Ishiyama explains this was actually the starting point for Paranormasight’s inception. “I first decided what the final goal of the game would be, and from there I began to plot out the broad elements I needed to include, such as the Seven Mysteries,” he explains.\r\n\n \nRead more",

He's not only spoken at length about how playing the original pair of Zelda games on the NES provided ample inspiration for his crafty hack and slasher, but you can also see it right there in the game itself, from your fox hero's bright green outfit to the beautifully illustrated in-game manual you piece together to unravel the world's mysteries. \nBut speaking with Shouldice at GDC this year, I wanted to talk to him another other potential source of inspiration. Before he struck out on his own to make Tunic, Shouldice cut his teeth making hidden object games, ranging from globe-trotting mystery adventures to Atlantean-themed detective stories. On paper, this earlier work would appear to provide the perfect proving ground for Tunic, as we all know by now that it holds plenty of secrets of its own. For Shouldice, though, it was more of a reaction against his earlier work that fuelled his approach to Tunic, as he gradually came to realise his hidden object games \"weren't tapping into this very specific type of mystery and discovery and player agency and true exploration that I was interested in,\" he says.\nRead more",

These are the best Zelda-likes on PC we'd recommend playing today.\nRead more",

It's also why I'm a little surprised how engrossing Foxhole is as a strategy game. As most players (including Brendy) will tell you, it's a game all about shuffling, ie. logistics.

The Pop Mini Air is a distillation of this trend, offering a Micro ATX or Mini ITX form factor that still packs in plenty of cooling potential and useful additions for a very low price. Normally the case retails for $90 in the US, but today you can pick it up in white from Newegg for $70 - a great deal for a solid case! \nRead more",

          "description": "It's been a harrowing few years in our real world, and I often feel like I'm just trying to keep my own little flame of hope safe from the howling winds of indifference and despair. So Darkest Dungeon 2, a party-based dark fantasy roguelite centered on the idea of doing just that, ended up being a bit too familiar and also a bit therapeutic. Having well over a hundred hours in the first game, I was also pleasantly surprised by some of the ways this carriage-bound journey into existential dread changes up the formula… and not so much by a couple of others.\nJust like its predecessor, Darkest Dungeon 2 leads with vibes and attitude. Every bit of art and atmosphere is subtly (or not-so-subtly) menacing, worn down, and melancholic, with Wayne June's unmistakeable narration laying out the compelling story of a quest for answers that went too far. The background on how the world got this way is doled out in tiny morsels of tragic exposition after the conclusion of each run, so I always had new details to look forward to whether I won or lost. It's very clear that reality is, as they would say in the Bay Area, \"hella broken,\" and that it's somehow your fault as the nameless financier of these soul-rending expeditions into the darkness. But the nature of your crimes takes a long time to reveal itself.\nRead more",

They've attracted strong user and critical reviews since debuting a few years back, as they offer a good balance of airflow, pressure, noise and price, and now you can pick up a five-pack for just £22 - a solid £5 off their normal cost, and the cheapest they've been since 2020. \n*OK, there are some passively cooled PCs, but most of us have at least one case or radiator fan contributing to our airflow needs! \nRead more",

          "description": "It’s funny how some aspects of game design are so ubiquitous that we stop questioning them, or even noticing them. After decades spent playing video games, I know that if I look behind the waterfall, there’s likely to be some sort of shiny goodie to collect. If I head left rather than right at the start of a level, I’m bound to find a juicy secret. There are conventions. Traditions. I can’t remember a time when games didn’t have giant lifts - and yet, I’m not entirely sure why they’re there. I’m not talking about the regular kind of lifts that you pile into, usually at the end of a level, to transition from one part of the game to another; those ones have historically been used to hide lengthy loading times, like the interminably long lifts of Mass Effect. \r\n\n\r\nWhat I mean is the lifts that are essentially tennis-court-sized moving platforms, usually with little more than a flimsy guard rail around the edge to stop elevator enjoyers from plunging down the shaft. Even more specifically, I’m talking about the diagonally moving elevators that trundle slowly into the depths, often to some nefarious laboratory. There’s a good example in the Resident Evil 2 remake, where you fight the final boss on an inclined elevator as it slowly, ever so slowly, descends towards the train that will grant your escape. So where did these giant elevators come from? And why do developers keep putting them in their games? I set out to answer both questions, and went somewhere unexpected.\r\n\n \nRead more",

They describe the game as \"fun, campy and spooky\" and hint at yet more secrets to be revealed.

And having played the first mission of the game at GDC, I can confirm that yes, this is very much in the vein of first-person Returnal. It's a fast-paced, bullet hell shooter set on a strange alien moon where everything's out to get you, but the shift in perspective makes everything in its titular abyss feel closer and more intimate, calling to mind the frantic, confined gun fights of Doom and Quake more than Housemarque's seminal roguelike - games that creative director Benni Hill tells me were formative experiences for him growing up. \nThere's also a greater emphasis on story-telling in Luna Abyss, with Hill also citing Nier: Automata and Bioshock as other key influences. It's a compelling mix, based on the first chunk I played, and arguably one of my surprise GDC favourite demos alongside The Thaumaturge and The Lamplighters League. Indeed, Hill tells me they started working on Luna Abyss a year before Returnal was even announced, and when they first saw it during Sony's PlayStation 5 reveal stream in the summer of 2020, he and his team did a collective double-take.\nRead more",

While part of Park Beyond's selling point is making literally impossible rides via the aptly-named method of Impossification (an upgrade to rides you buy by spending units of amazement gleaned from your slack-jawed guests, in order to strap a canon to a rollercoaster), I really was not prepared for how simulation-y the simulation bits are.\nRead more",

          "description": "\"What will ye do, when steel hearts break, and courage does abscond?\" reads the penultimate line of The Pale Beyond’s poetic prologue. Actually, it’s less of a poem and more a call to action: how on earth will you keep a ragtag bunch of sailors alive in the harshest conditions on the planet? If you hadn’t already twigged, The Pale Beyond is a narrative survival sim that puts you in the frostbitten boots of First Mate aboard The Temperance - a coal guzzling steam ship that set out on a polar expedition in search of its sister, The Viscount, which went missing five years prior. As Captain Hunt’s second-in-command, you’ll take daily requests from the crew, manage the food rations, and settle petty squabbles on the poop deck.   \r\n\n\r\nBeginning life as a way for co-founders Michael Bell and Thomas Hislop to create World of Warcraft mods, Bellular Studios grew alongside its gaming and Warcraft YouTube channels into a fully-fledged development team based out of their hometown of Belfast, Northern Ireland. The Pale Beyond is their debut game that fittingly draws on Ireland’s rich maritime history, although, as Hislop tells me, this wasn’t always the plan. \"We initially didn’t set out to do so, but it quickly emerged as a core influence that we kept finding ourselves drawn back to,\" he says. \"The further we delved into the golden age of exploration, and its very local routes, the more it resonated with us personally.\"  \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "As you might expect from a roster of 12 Marvel superheroes (or 17, if you count the four extra DLC supes and its original, player-designed protagonist The Hunter), the lycra-clad buds of Marvel's Midnight Suns all look and feel substantially different from one another when it comes to combat. When Firaxis were designing the moveset for each hero, creative director Jake Solomon says he and fellow lead game designer Joe Weinhoffer would take turns being \"point designers\" for certain characters. \"Joe was point designer on one hero, I was point designer on another hero,\" Solomon says, highlighting Magic and Iron Man as two of his own favourite heroes that he designed. \nBoth are what I'd call quite technical heroes, with Magic relying on careful battlefield placement to boot enemies into nifty magical portals, while Iron Man's most powerful abilities often only come from discarding other cards.

Both elements are surprisingly high-quality for the price, with a nicer-looking and better-feeling scissor switch keyboard with circular keycaps and a compact 2.4GHz mouse that provides better speed and accuracy than a trackpad.  \nRead more",

          "description": "What colors are the other fingers?\nKohachi Studio has given us a teaser look at Black Finger Jet, a new run-and-gun title from former prominent Nazca developers. Nazca is the original developer behind Metal Slug, and a number of the attached names were directly involved in the development of some of the early titles in that series.\nNo real gameplay is shown in the trailer, as the game looks to be very early in development. There’s a page for it live on Steam, but even there, it just shows concept art and says that the game is still subject to change. However, both the teaser and the store page seem to heavily imply that Black Finger Jet will be lifting heavily from the team’s work on the Metal Slug series. It will include 8-directional aiming, and the eponymous Jet vehicle transforms into various configurations.\nhttps://youtu.be/ZIEwNh5ZLI4\nAmong the staff, Akio is covering art, and Meeher is the producer. Sound design is once again in the hands of Hiya! This probably all sounds unhinged, but all of those pseudonyms helped make the original Metal Slug run the games they are. Hopefully, they can pull of similar magic with Black Finger Jet.\nHea-vy Machine Gun\nIf you’re unfamiliar with Metal Slug, I pity you. Starting in 1996 on the Neo Geo MVS arcade, they set the highwater mark for both pixel art and run-and-gun shooters. Nazca (and the staff listed above) worked on Metal Slug 1-3, before SNK went bust and development moved to another team. That team made a valiant effort to continue the series for three more titles, and they didn’t do a bad job. However, for my money, Metal Slug 1 and X are where it’s at. Others hold Metal Slug 3 in the highest regard. However you shake them; they are legendary.\nBlack Finger Jet is currently only announced for PC. There is no given release window, but since it seems like they’re still recruiting staff, we might be waiting a while.\nThe post Black Finger Jet coming from former Metal Slug team appeared first on Destructoid.",

Olsson explained the reason why there's an Amnesia The Bunker delay.\nRare crashes plague Amnesia The Bunker\nAs Amnesia The Bunker has been going through the certification process, Olsson claimed on Twitter that they've found \"multiple, rare crashes that are very difficult to identify, reproduce, and thereby also fix.\" Olsson notes that they could've had the team work during weekends to make the release date, but he said that is not something they choose to do at the studio.\n\"Everything's coming together so nicely,\" Olsson said to fans. \"We have the gameplay, the art, the animations, the atmosphere, the narrative, everything is coming together, and we are really ready to ship this out to the world.\"\nhttps://youtu.be/jvUV3Hh6b0g\nAmnesia The Bunker's original release window was March 2023. The first delay pushed it to May 16, but with this announcement, the horror title will now creep into fans' homes on June 6. When it does arrive, players will be taken through a haunted bunker from World War 1. You're playing as a soldier that's been cut off from his battalion and has to face this creepy environment alone.\nOlsson also confirmed that an Amnesia The Bunker demo will be released on Steam. No official demo release date is out, but the creative lead did say to keep an eye out for the timing.\nHopefully, this Amnesia The Bunker delay will be the last as it approaches its release on June 6. It will be released on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S. This may give you enough time to finish the Resident Evil 4 remake (or replay it on another difficulty).\nThe post Amnesia The Bunker is slightly delayed to June 6 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Movie will be officially available for purchase in the U.S. via the company's streaming service, Universal Pictures Home Entertainment, from tomorrow, May 16. It will retail for $29.99, or rentals are also available.\nThat's a lot of Golden Coins.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie, which premiered in theaters on April 5 of this year, has been a staggering success — already surpassing a $1 billion box office to become the most successful cinematic release of the year so far, beating out offerings from the Marvel and DC Cinematic Universes. The Super Mario Bros. Movie joins a very small circle of films to have broken the billion-dollar barrier since the COVID-19 pandemic, and is expected to be the highest-grossing film of 2023.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-uw1ZmIi7o\nDirected by Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic, the Illumination-produced movie sees the iconic Nintendo mascot and his friends face off against the nefarious Bowser and his army of familiar ne'er-do-wells. While critics have been fairly divisive of the film, clearly audiences were ready to just return to theaters amidst a wave of color, noise, and silliness. The success of the film is expected to lead to further collaborations between Nintendo and Illumination in the future, with either studio tentatively suggesting that they have been both impressed and inspired by the film's incredible release.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie is still in theaters worldwide, and can be rented or purchased in the U.S. via the Universal Pictures Home Entertainment service tomorrow, May 16.\nThe post The Super Mario Bros.

          "description": "1962 - 2023\nThis morning has shone a sad light on the news that voice actor Brendan O'Brien passed away earlier this year at the age of 60 — The American performer had starred in several films, TV shows, and video games, but will be best known to video game fans as the original voice of PlayStation platforming hero, Crash Bandicoot.\nO'Brien's passing happened back on March 23, but this evaded public notice until this past weekend, when game developer Tony Grayson reported the news on Twitter. A eulogy was also added to the Legacy website last week, which speaks of O'Brien's adoption of acting at a very early age, as well as his musical expertise, and his love of nature and exploration, shared with his wife, Ingrid.\nIn the video game sphere, O'Brien performed the array of wild and madcap sounds that Crash makes as he barrels his way through the Wumpa Islands, offering the zany hero personality through chaotic screams and yells, as well as the memetic \"Whoa\" that is still intrinsically linked with the series and its characters to this day. O'Brien would voice Crash and other characters, including Tiny Tiger, Dr. N. Gin, and Dr. Nitrus Brio in earlier Crash titles including Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back, CTR: Crash Team Racing, and Crash Bash.\nA fascinating element of O'Brien's legacy lies in the fact that, while he never really delivered any actual dialogue as Crash Bandicoot, he infused the personality and character that would lead to the platform hero becoming a huge success, during an era when many such characters would be left by the wayside. And while O'Brien would eventually leave the character in his past, he helped the franchise — one that shape the formative years of so many players — find the heart and success that endures today.\nWe at Destructoid offer our sincere condolences to his friends and family.\nThe post Original Crash Bandicoot voice actor Brendan O’Brien passed away appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Only that pesky Wii Fit board lies in its path\nLast week, Nintendo finally launched its long-awaited Switch sequel The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom — And while Nintendo typically tends to keep its cards close to its chest regarding game sales, the numbers crunchers operating the UK Charts have already released some impressive stats.\nAs curated by Gfk, (and reported by GamesIndustry.biz), Tears of the Kingdom saw the second biggest Nintendo launch ever in the UK — that's including all week one sales figures for all Wii, Game Boy, and SNES releases. Regarding revenue, the sky-high sequel is beaten out only by the 2007 exerciser Wii Fit, due to the expanded price of the Wii Fit Board peripheral. In terms of units sold, Tears of the Kingdom sits in fourth place after Wii Fit, and the combined sales taken from sibling Pokemon titles, such as Pokemon Sun & Moon or Pokemon Sword & Shield.\n\nEssentially, when viewed from a non-peripheral, non-double-pack standpoint, Tears of the Kingdom essentially had the biggest UK launch in Nintendo history — And that's just referencing physical sales in one territory. When you factor in the success that was no doubt seen across th weekend in Japan and North America, then Tears of the Kingdom looks set to be an absolute all-timer for Nintendo, definitely resting in the premier league of the company's sales charts.\nThis is emphasized by industry analyst Mat Piscatella, who suggests that Nintendo's latest could find itself lingering in the sales charts \"for years\", much like its Switch sibling Mario Kart 8.\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is available now on Nintendo Switch.\nTears of the Kingdom is the second biggest Nintendo launch in UK history [GamesIndustry.biz]\nThe post Tears of the Kingdom had the second biggest Nintendo launch in UK history appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Wile E. Coyote heads to Hyrule\nWe're now three days into The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, which has certainly seen a lot of players dive into the latest Hyrule adventure. A big part of this new entry is construction: being able to build and break things in equal measure thanks to the Ultrahand power.\nUnsurprisingly, everyone has built some weird, weird stuff with it. Cars and planes seem almost banal compared to what I've seen. Take, for example, Giant With a Rocket Appendage. You can guess which appendage has the flames.\nhttps://twitter.com/ZAKUYA_BOTW/status/1657265674400706560\nThe experiments are not limited to Link alone, either. The new backpack-addled Koroks have become crash test dummies for the courageous hero's harebrained inventions.\nhttps://twitter.com/sarahpodz/status/1657107025791156225\nEven in shrines, I find myself not settling for functional, but aiming for the absurd. There's a slapstick comedy vibe to all the physics-driven possibilities in this space, and it's supremely enjoyable to smash these systems up against each other.\nAs Tears of the Kingdom goes on, and I continue to unlock more and more Zonai tools, the possibilities feel endless. At first, a simple car was a surprise. But after building flame-spewing trucks and laser-blasting roombas, it feels like there's a world of design and invention waiting out there in Hyrule.\nSo, to the Destructoid community, I ask: what's the weirdest thing you've made so far? Share your inventions, successful or not, in the comments below and help spur on the general imagination. I'm hoping to find some sparks of inspiration for my next Korok delivery system.\nThe post What’s the weirdest thing you’ve made in Tears of the Kingdom so far? appeared first on Destructoid.",

Players choose from one of three vessels — Mazinger Z, Great Mazinger, or Grendizer — before embarking on a mission to defeat the endless forces of The Mechanical Beasts, Mycenae Forces, and The Vegan Empire, which have combined their powers in a joint plan to conquer the world. What follows is eight stages of frenetic arcade action, as the Mazinger forces battle the three factions and the mastermind, Dr. Hell.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQ1EgpzTEjU&ab_channel=HAMSTERCorporation\nWhile the arrival of Mazinger Z is very much a welcome one, it comes at something of a price, quite literally. In order to secure the license to release Mazinger Z, Hamster was pressed to roll out extra Yen to the license holders. The publisher is looking to pass this cost on to the player, as Mazinger Z will retail for twice the price of all Arcade Archives entries. This is the first time that Hamster has had to pay the additional licensing fee, which suggests that any future re-releases based on popular and lucrative brands might also see a lift in their retail costs.\nIt's rough, especially given that many Arcade Archives releases are already a little princely for their longevity, but for Mazinger fans, the extra buckeroos will probably be seen as a bill worth footing.\nMazinger Z is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch priced at around $15.\nThe post Mazinger Z blasts off of the page and into the Arcade Archives appeared first on Destructoid.",

But Link's heroics haven't always been limited exclusively to The Legend of Zelda series.\nNo, Link has been on many adventures outside the lands of Hyrule too, into entirely different game worlds. Some are within the Nintendo universe, and others — including maybe his most famous guest appearance — come from other companies.\nSo as we celebrate a new adventure for Link, I wanted to look back at the various times he's appeared in other games.

Beyond that, they have announced that legendary composer, Akira Yamaoka, is contributing 10 pieces to the soundtrack.\nDescribed as a story-rich horror adventure game, Decarnation stars a cabaret dancer, Gloria. Her whole life is taking a dive when a mysterious benefactor taps her for an “artistic endeavor.” The press release states that there are 15 types of gameplay within, including puzzles and mini-games “accounting for real-life situations (performing a cabaret show on stage) or metaphorical ones.” Underlying this are survival horror conventions, tying it together.\nhttps://youtu.be/aKjwWZekIV0\nThe story takes cues from David Lynch and Satoshi Kon. It should be trippy. Or, at the very least, fleshy. The aesthetic looks absolutely delightful.\nAkira Yamaoka is the fashionable composer behind Silent Hill and about a million other games (Smart Ball, really?) He’s one of those composers you may have actually heard the name of because he’s touched all sorts of greats. I’m not sure if 10 tracks is going to be a lot or a little of Decarnation’s soundtrack, but that’s pretty cool.\nUnrelated aside, Akira Yamaoka was selling his guitar for charity some years back. And my father came so close to buying it. Or at least bidding on it. Someone may have wanted more. I just would have loved to play that guitar.\nDecarnation launches May 31, 2023. It will be initially released on Switch and PC.\nThe post Decarnation launches May 31, includes music by Akira Yamaoka appeared first on Destructoid.",

Yes.\nKaizō Chōjin Shubibinman was the first game in the series that started on the PC-Engine in Japan. We received the second game (named Kaizō Chōjin Shubibinman 2) in North America on the Turbografx-16, but no other titles. Renamed Shockman, this second title eventually made it to the Virtual Console. I just now realize that I forgot to buy it before the Wii U eShop shut down. Crap.\nhttps://youtu.be/gsQY9Ha8yjo\nThis is the first time that the first game has been localized. The announcement of Cyber Citizen Shockman hit me out of nowhere. The Shockman games are a series of action platformers with sort of a beat-’em-up slant to them. The Satellaview Shockman title (which was originally released also as Kaizō Chōjin Shubibinman) even got a fan translation recently as Shockman Zero.\nOn top of the base game, Cyber Citizen Shockman will include an image gallery, rewind, save states, a CRT filter, and illustrations by Suu Urabe.\nThis is one of those games where it absolutely sucks that we never got them in the West. It’s mostly understandable, because the Turbografx-16 was a resounding failure and we never got the Satellaview. But a translation has been a long time coming.\nThankfully, we don’t have to wait much longer. Cyber Citizen Shockman will release on May 19, 2023 for PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch at a very reasonable $5.99.\nThe post Kaizō Chōjin Shubibinman finally being localized as Cyber Citizen Shockman appeared first on Destructoid.",

According to frequent spoiler Billbil-kun , the EGS will be giving away two free games every week for the duration of the sale period, not dissimilar to the generous offerings dropped during the publisher's annual winter sale. As such, the identity of the first title will likely remain a mystery until the day it becomes available.\nhttps://twitter.com/billbil_kun/status/1643937657062412288?s=20\nThese games could, frankly, be anything, ranging from old-school indie hits to some prestige AAA titles. Let's not forget the Epic Games Store has previously offered up major releases such as Rockstar's magnum opus, Grand Theft Auto V, when it has been feeling particularly generous. Regardless, it'll be worth stopping in on Thursday and checking out the catalog for some discounted hits, because I'm sure your PC backlog is incredibly small right now.\nThe Epic Mega Sale takes place from May 18 - June 15.

          "description": "The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is a huge game that is particularly skilled at providing you with distractions. I crossed the 90-hour mark recently, and my in-game percentage tracker still shows less than 50% completion. Sometimes, however, you may run into a situation where you're not sure where you want to go. When that happens, I suggest talking to Patricia.\nPatricia is not a human character in Tears of the Kingdom. She's a sand seal, and Riju's personal sand seal at that. After cleaning up the main quest in Gerudo, you will find her in the southern corner of Gerudo town.\nPatricia loves to eat and will share bits of ambiguous wisdom, translated by her handler Padda, when you give Patricia food. Her favorite food, however, is Splash Fruit.\nIf you give her some splash fruit, her caretaker will let you know that she has spoken a string of strange numbers.\nThose numbers are, of course, coordinates, which you can find on the map or on the bottom of the minimap as you are exploring.\nIn the example I took screenshots of for this guide, it sent me to a person out in the middle of nowhere who happened to have a sidequest for me. I've done this a few times with Patricia, and she has always pointed me toward something I have not yet discovered.\nRunning out of things to do in Tears of the Kingdom is something that many players (myself included) won't run into for many hours, but it's nice to know there is an in-game database of distractions built into the game when you run out of activities.\nFor more on Zelda, you can read Game Informer's Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom review, our beginner tips guide, our interview with producer and director Eiji Aonuma and Hidemaro Fujibayashi, our Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Amiibo guide, and this feature of stupid screenshots.",

          "description": "Ranked Play is coming to Fortnite, and it's coming soon. According to a blog post from last Saturday, the team behind Fortnite will implement the new mode in the 24.40 update, introducing eight main ranks players can progress through. If Epic keeps to their usual schedule, the mode is expected to come this week, but a date has yet to be formally announced.\nOnce Ranked Play is added to the game, players will be able to toggle it on or off from the main menu. Other than the fact that it's generally more competitive, there aren't any major gameplay differences between Ranked and unranked play, though that's subject to change. In fact, most details about Ranked Play are not concrete, as Epic says this mode is going to be the start of Ranked Season Zero, so they can \"make any adjustments to issues and concerns that arise, while also working on additional features and overall improvements for when Ranked starts following the normal Battle Royale Season schedule.\"\nRanked Play will be available for both Battle Royale and its popular alternative, Zero Build. You'll have separate ranks for each mode. However, since Ranked Play is still in development, only certain party sizes will be available. In Battle Royale, you can play Solos, Duos, and Party (this excludes trios), and in Zero Build, you can only play duos. Ranked Play's Season Zero is set to end when the main season ends (early June), so hopefully, more party options will open up by then.\nRanked Play will also replace Fortnite's existing Arena mode. Other than the Console Champions Cup, the rest of the tournaments this season won't have any Ranked requirements. Eligibility for future tournaments will now rely on your rank and \"other factors\" Epic has yet to specify.\nWill you be playing Ranked Mode once it drops? Let us know in the comments!",

          "description": "Fans of first-person shooters and old-timey cartoons should keep an eye on Mouse. The recently announced game slaps the classic animation of yesteryear over a retro shooter template to create an experience that's old-school in more ways than one. \nMouse comes from Polish indie developer Fumi Games and is billed as a noir story-driven shooter about murder and deception set in a corrupt city. Players control a private detective wielding vintage firearms like a Tommy Gun, revolver, and Carcano rifle to blast the rather adorable rodent enemies.\nThe game’s Steam page describes Mouse as a play-your-way type of experience, emphasized by a power-up system in which players can collect special abilities and weapon upgrades that cater to a chosen playstyle. The trailer shows the game is very much a work-in-progress, but it’s already an eye-catcher. \n\n\nMouse is rendered in the classic rubber hose animation style that defined early 20th-century animation, which has found new life in video games such as Cuphead and Bendy and the Ink Machine. The game has no release window but will come to PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.",

But what if the new Amiibo was a more accurate reflection of players' time with the game?\nSometimes you are on the side of a mountain and you accidentally shoot a bomb arrow in the wall two feet from your face, fall to your death, and then snap a screenshot right after the moment where the UI disappears, but before the Game Over screen appears.

Discovery earnings call in February, CEO David Zaslav told investors that Mortal Kombat 12 was planned for release this year. Initially, Boon didn’t confirm or deny the news, but today he tweeted out a short video of a clock hand dramatically ticking towards 12 that then, interestingly, skips over it to strike 1. Boon's tweet asks, “Does anyone know what time it is?”\nDoes anyone know what time it is? #MortalKombatpic.twitter.com/pXY2wlidde\nMay 10, 2023\nIt might be the 12th mainline fighting game, but the teaser could be hinting at a reboot of sorts. Regardless, it appears an announcement could be imminent, which seems especially likely following the big delay of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. Summer Game Fest is less than a month away, so it wouldn’t be surprising to see the hotly anticipated sequel pop up there.\nMortal Kombat 11 was released in 2019, with its Aftermath expansion arriving the following year. Developer Netherrealm also released Mortal Kombat: Onslaught, a mobile RPG, last fall. Although Netherrealm has released an Injustice game in between Mortal Kombat releases since 2013, it appears to be bucking that trend by jumping straight to the 12th entry. \nWhat do you want to see in Mortal Kombat 12?

Requiem on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S gets a performance mode that lets players run the game at 60 FPS in exchange for a lower resolution. \nMeanwhile, the PC version is getting enhanced graphics options that allow players to further optimize presentational performance. Lastly, all versions of the game, including the Switch cloud port, will receive bug fixes via this patch.\nWe enjoyed A Plague Tale: Requiem, with editor Wesley LeBlanc scoring the game an 8 out of 10 in his review, which you can read here. Will you be trying out these new graphics options? Let us know in the comments.",

While the game received several free DLCs, the studio was also working on a larger expansion of paid DLC starring Hornet from the game. In 2019, the team announced this DLC had expanded massively in scope, to the point it'd now be a full sequel game called Hollow Knight: Silksong. Since then, fans of the first Hollow Knight have wondered when they'd be able to play Silksong.\nWhile waiting to learn more, read Game Informer's Hollow Knight review and then read about why Silksong is one of our most anticipated upcoming games. \nAre you excited for Silksong?

It will publish a new action-adventure game from Game Freak meant to be a new IP for the developer. \nCodenamed \"Project Bloom,\" Game Freak and Private Division state in a press release the new IP is expected to launch during Private Division parent company Take-Two's Fiscal Year 2026. Alongside this news, Game Freak has released the first piece of concept art for Project Bloom. You can check it out below: \n\n\"We're thrilled to have the opportunity to create new IP that is bold and tonally different from our prior work,\" Game Freak director Kota Furushima writes in the release. \"From the beginning, Private Division was the publisher we wanted to work with on our new game. Their track record and global expertise gives us all the confidence to create a sweeping new action-adventure game that we can't wait to share more about in the future.\" \nTake-Two Interactive chief strategy officer and Private Division head Micahel Worosz says you'd be hard-pressed to find a studio with more iconic hits over the past 30 years than Game Freak, addding, \"We're ready to help Game Freak unleash their potential and we're honored to be the first Western publisher to work alongside this exceptionally talented and proven team to bring a bold new IP to market.\" \nGame Freak was founded in 1989 and is best known for developing the majority of mainline Pokémon entries across various Nintendo consoles. Its most recent Pokémon release was last year's Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. It has, however, released non-Pokémon games throughout its history, including this year's Pocket Card Jockey: Ride On! on iOS and macOS devices. \nPrivate Division was founded in 2017 as a third publishing label within Take-Two Interactive. Notable titles published by Private Division include Hades, The Outer Worlds, Kerbal Space Program 2, Rollerdrome, OlliOlli World, and more. \nAre you excited for a new IP from Game Freak?

With lush neon graphics and reflex-based platforming stages, the game promises fast-paced and frenetic action for fans of the high-speed, tight-controlling entries of the genre.\nAs Mr. Run and Jump, you explore the Realms of Color on a quest to defeat Void and find the hero's missing dog, Leap.

If this sounds up your alley, you can check out the announcement trailer below.\n\n\nMr. Run and Jump offers dozens of unique levels across six different worlds, as well as several enemies with distinct attack patterns and personalities. According to Atari, the title will offer more than 30 hours of gameplay when you take into account time trials, collectibles, and achievements.\nMr. Run and Jump arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, PC, and Atari VCS later this year.

The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.

          "description": "Don’t Nod, makers of Life is Strange and Tell Me Why, has announced that its next title, Harmony: The Fall of Reverie, is coming this June and will get a playable demo this month. \nSteam and Switch players can pick up the game on June 8, whereas PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S owners have to wait until June 22. Harmony: The Fall of Reverie is a choice-driven adventure starring Polly, a woman who returns home to find her missing mother. It's here Polly discovers she has clairvoyant abilities connecting her to a strange dimension called Reverie. While visiting this world, Polly becomes Harmony and encounters six powerful god-like beings called Aspirations, which serve as the hearts of humanity such as Glory, Power, Chaos, Bliss, and Truth. \n\n\nPolly must restore the balance between Reverie and our world and decide which Aspiration ultimately inspires humanity by making decisions represented by a system called the Augural. This web presents a multitude of scenes players will jump between that reveal possible futures that, in turn, unlock additional story branches. Polly does this by collecting crystals given to her with each choice and character bond she makes, which are used to unlock nodes on the Augural that alter the course of the story. \nHarmony: The Fall of Reverie sports a vibrantly illustrated art direction and a soundtrack by award-winning composer Lena Raine. You can try it out early thanks to a limited-time Steam demo launching today that will be available until May 21.\nFor more on Don't Nod, check out its other new title, Banishers: Ghosts of a New Eden, which also launches later this year.",

During an appearance this morning on Kinda Funny Games’ Xcast, the executive opened up about Redfall’s launch woes.   \n“There’s nothing that’s more difficult for me than disappointing the Xbox community,” says Spencer when asked about his reaction to the game's poor reception. “...just to kind of watch the community lose confidence, be disappointed, I’m disappointed, I’m upset with myself…”\nSpencer continues by touching on the criticism of Redfall launching at 30 frames per second and how it goes against Microsoft’s original claim of first-party Xbox Series X/S titles always running at 60 FPS. “That was kind of our punch in the chin, rightfully, a couple of weeks ago,” he says …",

But its failure is a disappointing situation for several reasons. Developer Arkane is one of my favorite studios, so it sucks to see it fumble the ball. My admiration for the team made me genuinely excited for Redfall, which I still think is a cool premise on paper, making it a tough pill to swallow in practice. But the most upsetting element is seeing a studio fall short after trying something new and getting criticized for even attempting it.  \nThere are many valid reasons to drive a stake through Redfall’s heart, but the most worrying sentiment I’ve seen is Arkane should have never made it and given us Dishonored 3 or Prey 2 instead. That’s an understandable wish; I…",

This new co-op brawler is coming this summer and will revitalize the dormant series in a new tag-team-focused adventure.\nSet in New York City after it’s been destroyed by nuclear war, Billy and Jimmy must take back what remains from the violent gangs that have since taken over. They won’t be doing it alone, though. The game features 13 playable characters, including Marian, the brothers’ old love interest, who now packs a pistol to blast threats from afar, and newcomer Uncle Matin, a tank-like fighter with a riot shield. \n\n\nAccording to a press release, Double Dragon Gaiden boasts “seamless tag team abilities and a multitude of strategies for devastating combos, defensive and offensive moves.” Solo players can swap characters on the fly to switch between their individual skills, such as the offense-focused Jimmy and more defensive Billy. The game supports two-player local co-op at launch (online co-op is coming in a post-launch update). \nDouble Dragon Gaiden tasks players with toppling four gang leaders and features a unique dynamic mission select system. Missions can be tackled in any order, and this selection affects their length, difficulty, and the number of enemies that appear. Earning cash unlocks powerful special movies that instantly knock out enemies, and you can also obtain crowd control moves that can wipe out multiple foes. Other gameplay options include an adjustable difficulty, permadeath and infinite modes, and unlockable bonuses. \nDouble Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons is being developed by Secret Base and published by Modus Games. It's coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.",

          "description": "Redfall is now available for players worldwide, but unfortunately, I’ve only been playing for a few days and cannot provide a full review yet.\nWriting this Redfall review-in-progress is painful because Arkane Studios is one of my favorite game developers, and its new game is largely disappointing. While the open world is beautifully sculpted with intriguing vistas, it’s weirdly empty, often implying that the harbor town’s vampire usurpers invaded during the offseason. \nAs a whole, Redfall’s gameplay is unbalanced. Several puzzling decisions, like a lack of stealth takedowns or the inability to pause the game in single-player mode, are far from what I’d expect from an Arkane game. Rampant technical issues hinder the brighter moments of the experience, including frequent server crashes, inputs failing to work, NPCs and enemies spawning duplicate versions of themselves, and one very frustrating bug which prevents me from closing the world map and main menu in cooperative play. \nOn a positive note, I like the four launch protagonists, each with unique skills you can upgrade via a straightforward-but-effective skill tree. Also, a handful of weapons are neat, like the heavy-hitting stake launcher or ultra-violet raygun that turns vampires to stone. A few locations, like a deranged scientist’s mansion, a cliffside lighthouse, and a hangar repurposed as a prison quarter, provide enough challenge to incentivize intelligent pathfinding. Unfortunately, most locations and enemy placements feel haphazardly designed – certainly a byproduct of creating two open-world maps. \nHowever, my evaluation may change in the coming days. I’ve completed roughly 50 percent of the game and its first story arc, but I’ve only played for a few days and have more content to see.\n\nWe’re reviewing Redfall on PC. Here are our computer specs: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090, AMD Ryzen 9 5950X 16-Core Processor, 64GB RAM",

The PC version has been especially problematic, and Respawn is addressing these issues with a performance update. \nThe PC version of the game has reportedly been plagued with a variety of bugs and glitches, notably affecting frame rate. Today’s update, which is now live, is only stated as being “performance improvements for non-raytraced rendering\" in the patch notes. \nThat doesn’t seem like the most helpful update on the surface, but it's worth noting that the multiple improvements coming to the console versions, which are listed below, have already been implemented on PC:\nMultiple crashes fixed across PlayStation and Xbox Series X/S and various areas of the game.\nFixed crashes that were tied to skipping cinematics.\nPerformance improvements across PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.\nFixed an issue with dynamic cloth inside the Mantis\nFixed various rendering issues.\nFixed an issue with registered Nekko colors not saving.\nFixed an issue with registered Nekko disappearing from the stable.\nFixed issues with cinematic dialogue overlapping.\nFixed various collision issues.\nFixed an issue with enemy A.I. remaining in T Pose during photo mode.\nFixed a freeze that occasionally occurred while talking to Doma.\nFixed a bug where the BD-oil VFX did not properly render.\nFixed an issue where players were getting stuck inside the Chamber of Duality if you didn’t save after leaving the chamber and die. \nHopefully, today’s PC patch does some significant help, but if not, Respawn, at least has other updates in the works. If you’re playing on PC, how has your experience with Star Wars Jedi: Survivor been? Has today’s update helped at all? Let us know in the comments.",

Movie continues to be a massive success and became the first film of 2023 to leap past $1 billion at the global box office. \nThe film achieved this milestone on Sunday, less than a month after its U.S. premiere on April 5. According to Variety, the film has grossed $490 million in North America and $532 million internationally, adding up to rough total of over $1 billion. Despite a tepid critical reception, Illumination’s adaptation of Nintendo’s flagship franchise has already become the highest-grossing video game film ever, the highest opening weekend, and the top-grossing film of 2023 so far.  \nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie is also just the fifth movie to cross the billion-dollar threshold since the pandemic started. It joins the coveted ranks of Avatar: The Way of Water, Spider-Man: No Way Home, Top Gun: Maverick, and Jurassic World Dominion. \nFor more on The Super Mario Bros.

          "description": "Vampire Survivors is going Hollywood thanks to the announcement of an upcoming animated TV adaptation. \nDeveloper poncle has confirmed that it's working with gaming consulting company Robot Teddy and media company Story Kitchen to bring the hit arcade bullet hell game to the small screen. Story Kitchen is helmed by names such as Dmitri Johnson (co-producer of the Sonic the Hedgehog films), John Wick creator/writer Derek Kolstad, and APA agent Mike Goldberg. There’s currently no other details about what the series will entail, such as the cast or a premiere date. \n“The most important thing in Vampire Survivors is the story, so it's a dream come true to see what started as a little indie game I made on my weekends come to life as an animated TV show! It’s also great to be partnering up with such experienced and talented people to make the show. I do wonder if they've realised that there isn't a single vampire in Vampire Survivors, though,” says Luca Galante, founder of poncle in a press release.\nIf you're tilting your head wondering how a pixelated arcade game can be translated into a show, it's worth nothing that Vampire Survivors has been brought to life in animated form before. Its two expansions – Legacy of the Moonspell and the recently launched Tides of the Foscari – both featured slick animated trailers, so those could be reference points for how this series may potentially appear. \nVampire Survivors has been on quite a roll since it launched to widespread acclaim last year, scooping up several end-of-year awards and walking away with a couple of BAFTA trophies this year, including winning Best Game.
