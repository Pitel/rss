Technically, the summons are called Eikons in this version of Squeenix's long-running JRPG series, and from the looks of the trailer, you'll be battling as them directly in big, dramatic battle sequences. A bit like in Final Fantasy X, just with an infinitely higher number of enormous explosions. Let's take a look, shall we?\nRead more",

Nevertheless, I wouldn’t have expected such high demands from its PC system requirements, which have appeared on Steam.\r\n\n\r\nHighlights include the AMD Radeon RX 5700 and Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 – a former flagship! – listed among the minimum specs, alongside a 12GB RAM requirement, and Windows 11 as the recommended OS. Those with a GeForce RTX graphics card could get some performance help, though, as the requirements’ notes say that meeting the recommended spec will allow for 4K resolution “using DLSS or similar technology”. That’s not quite a formal confirmation of Nvidia DLSS support, but strongly indicates it, maybe along with similar upscaling systems like AMD FSR or Intel XeSS.\r\n\n \nRead more",

So I thought this retrospective was a good opportunity to remind myself of why I still love this janky, weird ARPG about sad bloodsuckers so much, even 18 years after its release.\n Read more",

          "description": "Is it just me, or did Persona 5 never feel quite at home on the PlayStation 4? Sure, it looked gorgeous on a big TV, its bright colours popping all over your living room, but it always felt bit wrong to me. I think it's all about pacing. Persona 5's blend of turn-based combat and life sim elements hardly moves at a breakneck speed. There's a lot of reading. A lot of listening to your pals chat about their hopes and fears. A lot of pressing one button to progress a line of dialogue onto the next. Shoving that on your 65\" 4K TV always seemed a bit overkill.\r\n\n\r\nBasically, I never got into Persona 5 when it first launched on PS4. I played about three hours of it and then binned it off in favour of something else. In 2020, during a moment of first-lockdown madness, I bought Persona 5 Royal for full price, thinking maybe my issue with the original release was that there wasn't enough of it, but surprisingly discovered it still wasn't for me. At this point, I'd invested £100 into my \"Do I like Persona 5?\" experiment and was quickly realising the result was a pretty firm \"No, mate, you don't\". So when I sat down with the PC version of the game on the Steam Deck to test it out, I figured I'd play it for a few hours and then never touch it again. I was wrong. I was so very wrong.\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "I finished the original Persona 5 roughly four years ago, and it immediately earned my most coveted award: Edders Really Liked This A Lot, Perhaps More Than Anything Else. Since its updated and expanded Royal version dropped on PlayStation some years later, I've been afraid to make my return. You'd think I'd be itching to delve back into what's essentially the definitive version of the Phantom Thieves' adventure, and yet it's precisely because it blew me away the first time that I've been reluctant to go back.\nNow? Now I feel silly. After playing the early portions of Persona 5: Royal, which finds itself coming to practically every remaining platform this week, including PC, my goodness me, it's wonderful to be back in Shibuya with the gang. Already it's the Persona 5 I adored, with new cutscenes and pacing adjustments to make it – somehow – even better. Have you never played Persona before? Good! Let me twist your arm.

You've likely seen similar games, but this one mixes the usual 2D pixel puzzle business with some hazardous platforming, and a cloning system that rapidly move beyond the obvious \"standing on your own shoulders\" uses.\nThe balancing of all that didn't quite work for me, but I'm generally fairly averse to puzzle games and demanding platformers, so you ought not to count that against it. If you're more the type to take apart a puzzle step by step than to wing it while your subconscious yells from the sidelines, this could even be a real gem.\nRead more",

Unfortunately, while on a deep sea dive to retrieve the tapes of episodes 13 and 14 (an expedition funded by supporters; your generosity is always appreciated), my ship was attacked by a large and unusually toothsome whale-like creature. The cursed thing took a huge bite out of the side of our noble vessel, The Squiggled Egg, and we were forced to abandon ship. It was only by the grace of the botswain Hughbert Threads that I'm alive to write this post today, as the man gave his life beating back the foul beast, giving a large part of the rest of the crew time to get away. Alas, in the confusion, I only secured episode 14, and episode 13 is now lost to time. That is definitely what happened, and not that the digital recording got mangled somehow.\nStill, episode 14 (which is now episode 13, even though I say 14 in the recording) is now here for you to enjoy. It's all about bad and obsolete palaeontology - the weird ways people in history interpreted fossils, and why.\nRead more",

At some point there'll be a two hour YouTube video outlining how it has a clear and nuanced plot, or that it's a metaphor for periods and erections, or both. In the immediate, it's about slithering out of a pod, staggering through the desert, and finding yourself in a strange, huge rotting machine made of rock and flesh that's already decades into abandonment and decay, and where most things look a bit penisy or womby. It's about the lizardy parasite latched to your back gradually transforming your body. It's about grim squishy noises and survival.\nScorn doesn't have dialogue, or a map. It doesn't really have a HUD, it doesn't have quest markers, and your character will not, upon seeing a strange new device, say something like \"Hmm... seems like a key. Maybe if I find the two missing ones, it'll open up a way forward!\" out loud. It won't even pull focus to the corridor you should check next.

          "description": "The Ryzen 7 5800X was a great gaming CPU when it launched in 2020, and it remains one of the fastest options going despite the recent release of Ryzen 7000 processors late last month. The 5800X also has two major advantages: it works on a wide range of cheap motherboards with DDR4 RAM, and it's way cheaper than the 7700X - especially when it's discounted on Ebay US, as is the case today!\nSo: let's cut to the chase. The 5800X is down to $229.99 at Ebay, from a list price of $449, meaning it's nearly 50% off. That also makes it $170 cheaper than the equivalent Ryzen 7000 processor, the $400 eight-core Ryzen 7700X. Or, to put it another way, you're paying around 60% of the price for at least 80% of the gaming performance of that newer CPU - not bad, given that you'll also pay way less for a complete Ryzen 5000 system (with AM4 motherboards and DDR4) than a complete Ryzen 7000 one (with AM5 motherboards and DDR5). \nRead more",

          "description": "Detective games are often about filling in the blanks. A terrible crime will sit at the heart of them, yes, but most take place in the days and weeks that follow, where the bulk of your time is spent gathering clues and building a case to work out whodunnit. Rarely do you get to glimpse the immediate aftermath of the crime itself, where all the major suspects are still in play and their pockets are stuffed with incriminating evidence they'll no doubt be disposing of in the coming minutes. \nThe prime exception to this rule is Lucas Pope's Return Of The Obra Dinn, which gives you a time-travelling pocket watch to revisit the scenes of its many, many murders and work out exactly what happened to its 60-strong passenger list on its titular, ill-fated ship. Frogwares' Sherlock Holmes games and their mind palace visualisation techniques also warrant a mention here, and maybe even Outer Wilds at a push, if you count its 22-minute timeloop as an investigation scene several millennia in the making. But it's Obra Dinn that Color Gray Games emulate most strongly with their impressive debut in The Case Of The Golden Idol, which gives you a series of 12 murders to solve, each of which is presented as a freeze-frame vignette at the moment of death. You're still filling in blanks here, slotting names, objects and eventually verbs in its various scene scrolls to deduce whodunnit and howtheydunit, but this intriguing tale of 18th century high (and a secret) society, betrayals, backstabbing and murder most foul is a mystery game for the ages. \nRead more",

          "description": "I've long been excited about the possibilities offered by upcoming tidying things up nicely game A Little To The Left, and back in May this year Alice0 (one of us is RPS's Mirror Universe Alice, but nobody knows which) finally had a crack at it. The way she wanted to organise keys wasn't what the game thought was the right way, and her article examined this frustration; she described the canonical correct solution as being that of a \"domestic Joker\".\nThe developers at Max Inferno Studios read this article and decided that, you know what? Alice0 was on to something. They contacted us to let us know that her piece was the inspiration for adding a feature called Let It Be, a skip puzzle function that you can access at any time. Anne Macmillan, who's a co-founder of Max Inferno Studios as well as artist and animator for A Little To The Left, was kind enough to talk to me about it.\nRead more",

I adore its linear mission structure that is completely at odds with the expansive semi-open world shopping mall in which it takes place. Hell, I even like its severely stripped down Wii port. I firmly believe that Dead Rising is an all-time great, but also understand why folks have (reasonably) cooled on the game’s particular quirks. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Hello, yes, it’s me, once again banging on about the WD Blue SN570. I just think it’s neat: a highly affordable yet remarkably quick M.2 SSD, with multiple capacities to choose from and regular sales making it even cheaper. Speaking of, today is the last day of the Amazon Prime Early Access Sale, which has the 1TB Blue SN570 down to £65.\nThat’s not quite its lowest price ever, but it does match its flash sale pricing during Prime Day back in July. And is an utter pittance for a 1TB NVMe SSD, let alone one that’s actually quite speedy. Amazon UK also have the 2TB version on sale for £128, just £1 more than its lowest dip on record (Prime Day 2022 again, as it happens). These prices are only available to Prime members, but the Blue SN570 ranks highly among the best SSDs for gaming, so they're well deserving of your cash if you’re in need of PC storage improvements.\nRead more",

Below Deck: Mediterranean had me covered last winter (alongside its Sailing Yacht spin-off), as I watched super yacht crew toil to meet the demands of the wealthy and unhinged. Then Love Island stepped up to fill a large portion of my summer with curated chaos. One guy confessed \"I licked her tit or whatever,\" in a shock revelation to his betrothed.\nWhat's on the reality TV menu for winter? Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey, baby. It's on Netflix and I'm convinced it shares great parallels with some of my favourite RPGs of all time.\nRead more",

          "description": "Can your PC run it yet?\nCrytek has announced that its visually stunning shooter compendium Crysis Remastered Trilogy will be arriving on PC via the Steam platform on November 17 — The sci-fi revisit was previously made available to Epic Games Store in the fall of 2021, but is now close to surpassing its exclusivity deal.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N45pDqpfm8g\nAs one would naturally expect, Crysis Remastered Trilogy contains remasters of the three highly-explosive adventures in the Crysis franchise. Odd, that. Famously resource-hungry upon their initial PC release, the titles are well known for their dynamic action, dazzling visuals, and groundbreaking special effects. Of course, this trinity of remasters only serves to add further polish to all three games, with improved lighting and weather effects, high-resolution textures, and visual enhancements to the in-game models.\nIf you never got around to experiencing this exciting series of actioners, (perhaps your 486 DX 2 wasn't up to the task), then this release could prove the perfect opportunity to check them out. Steam will be launching the trilogy at a discounted price for the first week of release, with a pretty chunky 40% off of the asking price. In addition, players who already own the original Crysis Remastered on Steam will earn further discount, allowing them to round out the collection for not too many dollarydoos.\nCrysis Remastered Trilogy launches on Steam November 17. It is available right now on PS4, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Epic Games Store.\nThe post Crysis Remastered Trilogy blows up on Steam November 17 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Another really interesting story comes from Grancola1920, who mentioned in the comments that they \"recently ran into a bug with '???' after 700+ hours and it flew away before [they] could catch it. Now [they're] on a Hyrule wide bug hunt.\" It's amazing that stories like these can still come out of this game, even if a lot of folks have moved on.\nBut what about the missed connections, or abandoned quests?\nFor me, it's the Zelda: Breath of the Wild Korok Seeds\nI know! I 100%ed the game otherwise (all items that I know of/shrines): everything except the Korok Seeds. I was going to do it (and made good progress before guides were invented!), but once I saw the reward, I just couldn't go through with it.\nGrowing up, I always had a certain degree of satisfaction 100%ing games. Not every game was \"worthy\" of it, in that sense, but the ones I really connected to, I did go for it. But the real cherry on top of that sometimes grueling walk to that sundae was the reward. In character action games, it was occasionally a new costume or some insane toggle that fundamentally transformed the game in some way. That's enough for me.\nBut 900 Zelda: Breath of the Wild Korok Seeds with no real reward?

          "description": "Take the writer's eerie tale on the go\nJust in time for the scary season, Alan Wake gets a new portable form. Alan Wake Remastered is out today, October 20, for the Nintendo Switch.\nThe listing is currently live on the eShop and going for $29.99, with a launch discount bringing it down to $23.99 right now.\nNintendo Switch's version of the remaster contains all the content, including the base game and both The Signal and The Writer story expansions.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PORiCbyWAM4\nNotably, it runs on the Nintendo Switch too. Unlike some other modern games that have made their way to Nintendo's handheld recently, Alan Wake Remastered is not a cloud app, but seems to run right off the Switch hardware.\nThe writer will go portable\nIt's an impressive feat, and makes me a bit interested to see how the remaster holds up on Switch. Alan Wake Remastered was no visual slouch when it first released for other platforms.\nThat said, developers have been working some real technical magic with the Nintendo Switch lately. Just look at ports like NieR: Automata's Switch version. As the years have gone on, it's impressive what some have accomplished.\nWe'll see if Alan Wake Remastered also stands up as a port, but as a game, it's certainly held its following. Heck, it's well-liked enough to even be tied into Remedy's Control, and get a sequel greenlit for development.\nThis story of a writer fighting the dark with a flashlight seems to still hold sway. And if you're curious about it and want something eerie to dig into on the go, Alan Wake Remastered is now available for that on the Nintendo Switch.\nThe post Alan Wake Remastered is out on Nintendo Switch today appeared first on Destructoid.",

They actually resemble the patterns of the t-shirts that will appear in-game, which is a nice touch.\nA \"Collaboration Festival\" is also underway at Pokemon Centers \"nationwide\" (again, in Japan), where you can pick up tie-in stickers (featuring the key art for the event). Curiously, some centers also have \"polling stations,\" which include \"voting stickers\" for each choice.\nAs a reminder, everything will kick off on November 11 at 4PM PT, through November 13 at that same time. The Pokemon Center tie-ins begin on October 21, and will run through November 13 (or, as Nintendo points out, as long as supplies last).\nHere's a list of the Japanese locations hosting Pokemon Splatfest events:\nBic Camera Sapporo (Hokkaido)\nBic Camera Yurakucho (Tokyo)\nYodobashi Camera Multimedia Akiba (Tokyo)\nBic Camera Lazona Kawasaki (Kanagawa)\nYodobashi Camera Multimedia Yokohama (Kanagawa)\nYodobashi Camera Multimedia Umeda (Osaka)\nYodobashi Camera Multimedia Hakata (Fukuoka)\n\"All Pokemon Center stores\"\nThe post Japan is going all-out for Splatoon 3’s upcoming Pokemon Splatfest appeared first on Destructoid.",

Speaking in a short promo reel, which you can check out below, Gans revealed that the new film will be based upon the plot of 2001 game Silent Hill 2 — which is itself a fan favorite among the franchise's dedicated community.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_FOVN-UkEI\n\"This return is my return to a world, a universe I touched in 2006... 15 years ago,\" recalls Gans in the clip. \"The film was a great success and we decided to go back to the best of these stories.... Silent Hill 2. The film tells the story of a young guy coming back to Silent Hill, where he has known a great love [but] what he's going to find is a pure nightmare.\"\nKonami also took the opportunity to officially announce a remake of Silent Hill 2 itself, which will be headed up by the horror gaming heads of Bloober Team. In fact, it was also suggested that Return to Silent Hill is something of a catalyst for the various incoming gaming efforts, with Konami hoping that the new film will inspire players to dive back into the digital fog of the cursed town.\nReturn to Silent Hill will begin shooting in early 2023.\nThe post Return to Silent Hill is a new sequel to the cult 2006 movie appeared first on Destructoid.",

In much the same way that Monster Hunter World reminded video game fans at large what Monster World was, DmC5 reintroduced, (and in some cases, introduced), Dante and his sexy pals to a new audience of players on a global basis.\nIn fact, some would argue that DmC5 was one of the key titles that kicked off Capcom's latter-day renaissance, which has seen the legendary developer go from strength to strength with smash releases such as Monster Hunter World, Monster Hunter Rise, Resident Evil: Village, the Resident Evil remakes, Capcom Arcade Stadium, and the upcoming Street Fighter 6. In the fall of 2020, Capcom would release DmC5 for then-new platforms PS5 and Xbox Series X, in the form of Devil May Cry 5: Special Edition.\nDevil May Cry 5 is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.\nhttps://twitter.com/DevilMayCry/status/1582748663801335808?s=20&t=1xblAg-uet1GGzJ-_bjWsA\nThe post Devil May Cry 5 smashes past six million Super Sexy Sales appeared first on Destructoid.",

Telltale’s Tales from the Borderlands is an all-time favorite of mine that I’ve played through multiple times, and while I was disappointed to see that Gearbox’s take on Tales wouldn’t continue Rhys, Fiona, and Sasha’s story, I was optimistic that the sequel would be an enjoyable experience. How wrong I was.\nAs I made my way through each subsequent episode, I regretted taking on this review more and more. Now I’m tasked with detailing what a torturous experience this was, and to be the bearer of bad news. And likely incur some wrath from those who want to defend this hot mess.\nI honestly don’t even know where to start.\n\nNew Tales from the…",

          "description": "A surprise drop for a surprising follow-up\nNEO: The World Ends With You hits a new platform today. Square Enix surprise-dropped The World Ends With You's follow-up on Steam today, October 19.\nOriginally released in 2021, NEO: The World Ends With You first hit PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch. It later arrived on PC, though only through the Epic Games Store.\nThis Steam release brings the pin-slamming action onto Steam's platform, for anyone who wants it specifically on that storefront. It's going for $59.99, though as of this writing it has a 25% launch discount running until October 25.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvZquGt-XDA\nPicking this version up will net you the Legendary Threads and Reapers' Game Survival sets, for a little boost right out of the gate.\nNothing on the NEO: The World Ends With You Steam page indicates its Steam Deck status yet. It does have full controller support though, so that's at least an indicator that it's worth testing out.\nA new world\nNEO is the follow-up to The World Ends With You, a Nintendo DS game that launched in 2007 in Japan and 2008 abroad. The original has since seen several ports and been hailed as one of the DS' better games.\nWith NEO, Square Enix and h.a.n.d. took on a new tale (with some eventual tie-ins to the old, of course) and it came out alright. Its novel approach to the combat was interesting; new systems often had trouble mimicking the dual-screen battles that made The World Ends With You so unique,  so NEO went for a different approach that still tried to capture that puck-passing, pin-slamming combat.\nEven though NEO has some stiff competition this month for RPGs to play on Steam, it's still worth a look if you've ever been curious. It's a stylish, more modern RPG that uses its death game setting pretty well, with an absolutely stellar soundtrack.\nNEO: The World Ends With You is available on Steam for PC here.\nThe post NEO: The World Ends With You drops onto Steam today appeared first on Destructoid.",

Today, Konami revealed Silent Hill f, a forthcoming game set in 1960's Japan.\nThis \"beautiful yet horrifying\" world has an intriguing lineup of developers. Neobards Entertainment is developing, alongside producer Motoi Okamoto and creature and character design by kera.\nRyukishi07, the pen name behind stories like Higurashi When They Cry and Umineko When They Cry, is writing Silent Hill f. His stories often have a good mix of both horror and mystery to them, which seem like a great fit for Silent Hill. And the trailer already makes a fantastic first impression.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPNXE_q4BdE\nNo more info was shared today, either on platforms or release timing. Also no indication what the \"f\" stands for. It's styled a bit like a musical forte, maybe?\nHeading back to Silent Hill\nThis new game wasn't the only bit of Silent Hill news today. Konami also unveiled a Silent Hill 2 remake, in collaboration with The Medium studio Bloober Team.\nIts third-party expansion doesn't just include Silent Hill f, either. NoCode, which made Stories Untold and Observation, is working on its own Silent Hill project, subtitled Townfall.\nAnd Bad Robot is teaming with Genvid and a host of others for Silent Hill Ascension, an interactive experience that revolves around Silent Hill. We didn't get too much of an idea what that looks like, but the trailer definitely had a weird, live-stream horror vibe.\nWith all that, plus a new movie on the way, there is a surprising amount of Silent Hill suddenly on its way. You can watch the full livestream showcase and all the Silent Hill announcements here.\nThe post Silent Hill f looks like a creepy new story set in Japan appeared first on Destructoid.",

One of the exciting upcoming titles previewed during the stream is a new spin-off title made by Annapurna and award-winning studio No Code called Silent Hill: Townfall.\nThe teaser trailer opens with a mysterious voice on some kind of tape recorder that also features a screen showing some creepy images, as is the way of horror games. Unfortunately the trailer doesn't give us much info as to what the gameplay or story might look like, but tonally, it seems like it'll fit right in with the rest of the Silent Hill series.\nhttps://youtu.be/oRvRWBQNrSI?t=1329\nNo Code creative director Jon McKellan then appeared to give fans a little more insight into what to expect from the game. He describes how playing the original Silent Hill game in 1999 made him a lifelong fan, and how that title has influenced the types of games his studio has created in their previous releases, Observation and Stories Untold.\n\"It's a real honor for us to bring a new title to this series that both respects the source material, but also does something a little different with it,\" McKellan said. \"At No Code, we're all about weaving that [psychological horror] narrative and that experience into every aspect of our game design, our audio, our visuals, even our UI.\"\nThe studio doesn't have any more to share as of now, but it's exciting to just know that this game is happening at all. Given No Code's track record, especially with them working with Annapurna, I have some pretty high hopes that Silent Hill: Townfall will deliver both a terrifying and narratively fulfilling entry in the series.\nThe post Annapurna and No Code tease spooky new spin-off Silent Hill: Townfall appeared first on Destructoid.",

In addition, digging into the site's address bar and embed code has lifted the lid on an array of mysterious terms, all of which may or may not relate to one, or numerous, new entries. You wait years for a new Silent Hill etc... etc...\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvRWBQNrSI\nAmong the titles discovered in the embed code are \"Silent Hill\", \"Silent Hill 2\", \"Silent Hill F\", and \"Silent Hill: Ascension\". At a guess, this would suggest that Konami's stream may include the reveal of a brand new entry — Silent Hill: Ascension — as well as the announcement of the aforementioned remake/remaster of Silent Hill 2. The 2001 release is very much a fan-favorite in the series' spooky canon of releases and, as such, a prime candidate to make a grand return on modern platforms.\nAs for the identity of \"Silent Hill F\", this could just be a mere placeholder. I'm willing to bet that it stands for \"Silent Hill: Frogger\" — a sure thing given that Konami also owns that classic, road-crossing IP.\nThe truth will out this evening, when Konami finally takes to the airwaves for its Silent Hill Transmission stream. You can check out the news for yourself at 14:00 PT / 17:00 ET / 22:00 BST, and we'll be sure to bring you up to spend on all the gory details right here on Destructoid...

          "description": "(Not the ones hanging around the daughters of Dimitrescu)\nCapcom has informed fans that it is currently working on a fix for a fistful of serious bugs that are currently infesting the Steam edition of Resident Evil Village — Speaking on Twitter, the studio has assured players that a fix for the plague of issues is currently in the works.\nThe troublesome bugs appeared following the release of the Steam/PC edition's latest patch, which launched in-game on October 10.  Since its arrival, some Resident Evil Village players have found that the survival horror adventure either gets stucks in a restart loop, refuses to accept version compatibility while loading, or simply fails to boot entirely.  This is, no doubt, a very frustrating experience, especially for those currently picking through the game ahead of the incoming Winters' Expansion DLC.\nhttps://twitter.com/RE_Games/status/1582022175426375681?s=20&t=mhfHULksgj1vUm5V6kIu_A\nIt has been suggested by tinkerers that the crash is caused by code that stops the game dead should it find any anomalies in Village's main body of code. Readers will likely recall that the Steam edition of Resident Evil Village has had a particularly brutal run, hampered by performance issues attributed to the game's intensive anti-piracy software. While it has not been officially confirmed that this new issue is caused by a fearful code-tampering measure, it would be most eye-rolling to discover that players have once again gotten the shaft due to Capcom's paranoic attitude towards piracy.\nRegardless, a fix is en route, so players only need hold their horses for now.\nIn related news, Capcom will host a special Resident Evil Showcase tomorrow, October 20. The stream is expected to feature new trailers, updates, and details pertaining to Resident Evil Village: Gold Edition, the Winters' Expansion DLC, and the highly anticipated remake of Resident Evil 4.\nThe post Capcom working on game-breaking Resident Evil Village Steam bugs appeared first on Destructoid.",

The game is described as a collection role-playing game where players build a roster of fighters from the Mortal Kombat universe and “unleash them in massive real-time group battles.” It’s more than just battles, though – Onslaught is also said to feature a cinematic story experience where fighters have to defeat a “dark and dangerous threat.”\nThis is not the first time Mortal Kombat has appeared on a mobile device. Mortal Kombat Mobile was released in 2015 alongside Mortal Kombat X and eventually adapted characters and features from Mortal Kombat 11 as well. Mortal Kombat Mobile has been downloaded over 150 million times since its launch, so it’s no wonder WB Games wants to release more games from the franchise.\nOctober 8 marked the series’ 30th anniversary, and Mortal Kombat: Onslaught seems to be a celebration of that. Not only is it the newest mobile game in the series, but it’s also the most recent title since the release of Mortal Kombat 11 Ultimate in 2020. As far as the future of the series is concerned outside of the mobile market, Netherrealm has been pretty quiet lately. Outside of our interview with franchise co-creator Ed Boon where he said we'd have to wait a little longer, the most recent news we’ve received has been this tweet:\nPatiently waiting for news on NRS’s next game…. pic.twitter.com/1ulQHZhnKx\nOctober 15, 2022\nMortal Kombat: Onslaught is coming out sometime in 2023.

Plus, you can get a quick glimpse of Ash using his infamous chainsaw (it's unclear if it's attached at this point), likely alluding to the fact that this chainsaw might be a weapon pickup around the battle island, akin to the recent Kamehameha or E-11 Blaster Rifle mythic weapons in recent weeks.\nCheck out the Fortnitemares 2022 gameplay trailer for yourself below:\n\n\nA new Fortnite Blog post released today features additional details about the …",

However, I’m still journeying through Mario’s latest tactical crossover, so I’m not ready to give a full verdict as of yet. In the meantime, however, here are some impressions based on roughly the first half of the game.\nAs a fan of Kingdom Battle, I’ve enjoyed what I’ve played of Sparks of Hope. It retains the core strategic gameplay of the original, so if you liked the first game, you’ll probably enjoy this as well. Removing the grid and having freedom of movement feels liberating, however, and is one of the big game-changers. It's interesting because this doesn't change my approach to playing a turn-based tactics game.

Konami is broadcasting a Silent Hill Transmission this week.\nThe event airs Wednesday, October 19 at 2:00 p.m. Pacific/5 p.m. Eastern. A tweet only states the presentation will feature “the latest updates for the Silent Hill series.\" The tweet links to a new Silent Hill website, but it currently doesn't offer any more information. \nIn your restless dreams, do you see that town?\n#SILENTHILL Transmission on Wednesday, October 19th, at 2:00 PM. PDThttps://t.co/8Knoq9xYsa\nOctober 16, 2022\nKonami reportedly has multiple Silent Hill projects in development at various studios, a rumor recently corroborated by Silent Hill movie director Christopher Gans. The most persistent is that Bloober Team, creators of The Medium and Layers of Fear, is remaking Silent Hill 2. Late September, it was reported that a title called Silent Hill: The Short Message had been rated in South Korea. \nThe last full-fledged Silent Hill game was 2012’s ill-recieved Book of Memories for PS Vita. Of course, there was also 2014's P.T., the formerly playable teaser for Hideo Kojima's canceled Silent Hills. \nFor years, Silent Hill fans have had to settle for rumor and innuendo in regards to what’s next for the series, so hopefully, Wednesday’s presentation rewards that patience with some exciting announcements. What do you expect to see at the Silent Hill Transmission? Let us know in the comments!",

The presentation featured an extended guided walkthrough showing off new gameplay footage as well as a rundown of features designed to make the game more terrifying than ever. \nThe video’s side-by-side comparisons illustrate the major differences between the original and the remake. One big change is that the Ishimura is now a seamless, interconnected ship that players can explore more freely. For example, using Isaac’s rocket thrusters to soar through areas you could only walk through before. A new system called the Intensity Spawn Director remixes necromorph spawn points, ensuring they’ll ambush veteran players in unexpected ways and, sometimes, in greater numbers. Dead Space also features improved necromorph dismemberment, new side quests designed to flesh out the supporting cast, new alternate fire modes for weapons, new puzzles, and more. \n\n\nDead Space launches on January 27 for PlayStation5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

Their name is Bellibolt, and they’re the signature partner of Iono, the newest gym leader from Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.\n\n\nIn Wednesday’s initial video, Iono introduced herself as not just a gym leader but also a streamer. She then asked her fictional followers to guess what her mystery partner Pokémon was based on a handful of details, including its type, the placement of its eyes, and the fact that it’s “so cute.” If you had trouble guessing, don't feel bad; today, we’ve learned that her partner is a new Pokémon altogether.\nNintendo and The Pokémon Company released a series of follow-up tweets, giving us new information about Bellibolt that sounds like it was pulled right from the Pokédex. One of the images reveals that they have a new ability called \"Electromorphosis,\" which allows Bellibolt to power up their next electric-type move after being hit by an attack.\nSay hello to the new EleFrog Pokémon, Bellibolt!\n#PokemonScarletViolet\nhttps://t.co/z7lNKThsDX pic.twitter.com/EUdcQcsUoA\nOctober 14, 2022\nYou'll be able to add Bellibolt to your team when Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet come to switch on November 18.

The narrative-driven sci-fi adventure will now launch in April to ensure it receives a final coat of polish.\nDeveloper Dramatic Labs announced the news on Twitter, stating it’s taking the extra time to ensure “a truly immersive Star Trek experience”. You can read the full statement below (click the image to enlarge).\nResurgence was first announced during The Game Awards 2021 and is a choice-driven adventure game that follows a similar design template to Telltale Games’ titles (Dramatic Labs consists of ex-Telltale employees). The story unfolds shortly after the events of Star Trek: The Next Generation as players control two original characters, an officer and a commander, to solve a mystery aboard the U.S.S. Resolute. The narrative and your relationships change depending on your choices, and gameplay features light combat and puzzle-solving. Resurgence is currently slated to launch on PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC. \nWe played a demo of Star Trek: Resurgence during Summer Game Fest in June, and you can read our hands-on impressions here.

One has a youthful, almost teenage popstar look with strawberry-blonde hair and a hip-hop-esque fashion sense. Another version is clad in almost samurai-like armor. No matter the Bayonetta, the action unleashed by them looks as bonkers as you’d expect. For Jeanne fans, stay tuned until the end of the video, where we get a surprising look at a gameplay segment starring Bayo's BFF.\n\n\nBayonetta 3 is Game Informer’s cover story this month, and you can catch up on our exclusive features and videos at our cover hub by clicking the banner below. The game launches on October 28 for Switch.",

          "description": "Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales is making its way to Steam and The Epic Game Store next month. On November 18, you can swing through Harlem as Miles from the comfort of your PC desktop.\nSet one year after the events of Marvel’s Spider-Man, the story follows Miles as he battles the Roxxon corporation and the mysterious Tinkerer. A new trailer shows off the game’s PC features, which are comparable to the first Spider-Man game. Improvements include ray-traced reflections/shadows, unlocked framerate, ultra-widescreen support, Nvidia DLSS 3/DLAA support, Nvidia Reflex, and DualSense controller support. Check it out below.\n\n\nHere are the PC specifications as well (click the image to enlarge). \nWe scored Miles Morales a 9 out of 10 when it was released in November 2020. Former editor Andrew Reiner wrote in his review that: \n\"For a second act, Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales satisfies. Taking to the web-line and soaring across a wintery New York skyline is every bit as enthralling as it was before, and Miles develops into a fantastic hero. This follow-up doesn’t have as much of a sinister punch, but it delivers some great plot twists and concludes with another eye-opening post-credits sequence that teases an exciting future for Insomniac’s Spider-Man series.\"",

          "description": "Final Fantasy VII The First Soldier, the mobile multiplayer battle royale, is being shut down in January. The news comes a month shy of the game's one-year anniversary, having launched for iOS and Android in November 2021. \nSquare Enix states that it feels it hasn’t delivered the experience it aimed for, so it will begin winding down service starting today. A roadmap on the game’s website lists a three-step sunsetting schedule. Today, you can no longer purchase Shinra credits from the shop, but you can still spend the credits you own until the game shuts down. On November 1, support for non-English localization ends (meaning text will only be displayed in English going forward). Finally, on January 11, The First Soldier goes offline for good.\nHere's the full End of Service announcement via Twitter:\nThe First Soldier was revealed in February 2021 alongside another mobile FFVII RPG, Ever Crisis (which has yet to release but has a closed beta planned for this year). The third-person battle royale took place before the events of FFVII and pit 75 players against each other as SOLDIER candidates. In addition to using firearms, players wield magic and even summons. Square previously stated The First Soldier was an attempt to attract a wider fanbase to the FFVII universe while giving existing fans a new way to enjoy its mythos. \nUnfortunately, this isn't the first Square Enix published multiplayer game to get the axe this year. Babylon's Fall, Platinum Games' live-service action RPG, is also being shutdown in February, less than a year after its ill-received launch. \nWhile The First Soldier is going away, plenty of FFVII content is in the pipeline. As previously mentioned, Ever Crisis remains on the docket, and Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion releases on December 13. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, the follow-up to Remake, is scheduled to launch next winter.",

Check out the gym leader Iono trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, there's a lot going on in this new video. Iono is very much a Paldean influencer, which is a fun addition to the universe of Pokémon, but she's also a gym leader that we'll be facing off against in the game. As for her type, it's Electric, and while not confirmed, it seems the video is hinting toward a gym challenge for her. Before actually battling her, we might have to successfully complete her \"who's that Pokémon?\" test.\nIn this instance, she describes her very own Pokémon pal, but we don't get the answer. Perhaps we're meant to know what it is based on her description or maybe she's describing a Pokémon we haven't yet met. Only time will tell. Fortunately, we don't have to wait too much longer to meet this \"Supercharged Streamer\" because Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet hit Switch on November 18. \nIn the meantime, check out this 14-minute Pokémon Scarlet and Violet gameplay trailer from last week, and then watch this video all about Wiglett, a new Diglett-like Pokémon. Check out this trailer all about competitive play after that, and then read our Pokémon Scarlet and Violet preview for more details about Paldea, Terastallizing, and more. \nDo you have an idea of which Pokémon Iono is describing in today's trailer?

          "description": "Witchfire has been one of the most promising-looking shooters since its reveal in 2017. The dark fantasy romp was slated to launch in early access later this year, but a shift in design has forced developer The Astronauts to push that launch into next year.\nThe Astronauts has decided to rework Witchfire’s arena-style combat into an open-world format. Creative director Adrian Chmielarz writes in a blog post that the change makes Witchfire a “better” game. \n“The feature is now 95% implemented. It makes the game better. It is kind of hard for me to imagine the player did not have that freedom before. Sure, you can still be trapped by the witch in this or that spot, and some doors will be closed until you find a key, and it might be too dangerous to enter areas closer to the boss before you are ready– but the world is wide open for you to explore in almost any order, and you can both push forward and retreat as you please.”\nChmielarz also teases more Witchfire news to emerge in the next week or so. It won’t be gameplay footage but rather content promoting the game’s art and world in some fashion. \nWitchfire blends gunplay with the supernatural as players wield guns and magic to fend off otherworldly threats. The game is set in an alternate reality where you’re tasked with hunting down a witch at the behest of the church. The Astronauts previously developed The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, and the studio is made up of ex-People Can Fly employees. \nWitchfire is still slated to launch on PC via The Epic Game Store in early 2023.

Inspired by series like Final Fight, Kung-Fu Master, and Karate Champ, the fighting genre emerged in arcades, buoyed by a few significant players in the space. One of those franchises was Mortal Kombat, a bloody, gory fighting game that took concepts from other fighting games and dialed them to 11. The series became notorious for its spine-ripping, heart-grabbing, limb-chopping action, but beneath the controversies and the hearings was a technically sound, capable fighting game. \nThe Mortal Kombat franchise has continued to grow and evolve, showcasing massive staying power in a sometimes ruthless industry.

          "description": "To celebrate our Bayonetta 3 cover story, we're bringing back good old-fashioned Replay to revisit its direct predecessor, Bayonetta 2. You can tune in on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to join in on the fun, or catch the archive when it hits on our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel. \nReleased in October 2014 as a Wii U exclusive, Bayonetta 2 is a sequel that almost didn't happen. Despite a strong critical reception to the first game, sales didn't meet expectations, leading to publisher Sega passing on a follow-up. Thankfully, Nintendo swooped in to fund and publish Bayonetta 2, locking it in as a third-party exclusive. Bayonetta 2 features improved combat, new features, an even nuttier plot, and a near-bottomless well of action. Join me, Marcus Stewart, as I dig into my personal GOTY for 2014 and chat all about our Bayonetta 3 cover. \n\n\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes. You’ll also be granted entry to the official Game Informer Discord channel, where our welcoming community members, moderators, and staff gather to talk games, entertainment, food, and organize hangouts!\nBe sure to click the banner below to visit our Bayonetta 3 cover story hub for exclusive features and videos of the upcoming threequel.",

If you're looking for a special Mortal Kombat announcement, though, keep your expectations in check. Maybe something like that comes at a later date this month – who knows? – but today's trailer is all about Mortal Kombat's 30-year history in video games and other entertainment mediums. \nCheck out the Mortal Kombat 30th Anniversary trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, the video above doesn't announce any new movies or games, or even DLC for Mortal Kombat 11, but that's okay because it's still a great watch nonetheless, especially for longtime fans. \nHere are some fun Mortal Kombat 30th Anniversary logos as well: \n\nFor more, read Game Informer's Mortal Kombat 11 review and then read about how NetherRealm is done making Mortal Kombat 11 content as it moves into development of its next game.

Spoiler for Bayonetta 1: Cereza is the child version of Bayonetta, so perhaps our hero simply wanted to return to her adolescent roots. However, the third game's focus on the multiverse has prompted some fans to consider a more tantalizing theory. \nFirst, to provide some context, here's a (relatively) quick refresher of Bayonetta's backstory for newcomers or lapsed fans. Five hundred years prior to the events of the first game, Bayonetta, whose real name is Cereza, was born the child of an Umbra Witch and a Lumen Sage.
