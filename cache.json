          "description": "Blooming brilliant.\nOPUS: Echo of Starsong is intimidating. Not so much in terms of difficulty — there's very little of that in what's largely a visual novel-esque sort of business — but in terms of story, there's so much to take in. Even with the preceding two games (OPUS: The Day We Found Earth and OPUS: Rocket of Whispers) in your back pocket, you're going to be thrown in at the deep end here. The world of OPUS is a shockingly well-realised one, rich with lore that stretches across in-game decades.\nIt's easily the most expansive title in the series, offering a number of different inputs in order to facilitate exploration of its world, taking control of multiple different characters across multiple years. What we're swinging at here is it's a lot, though it may not seem like such at the very beginning. Thrown into a world of space pirates, miners, witches and extensive politics, you're following the very intimate, very human story of the relationship between intergalactic traveller Jun, his guardian Kay, and enigmatic Witch Eda, among many others.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

That includes RPS’ own Ed, whose otherwise glowing preview mentioned some performance issues on Nvidia GPUs. \r\n\n\r\nI’m duty-bound to investigate any potential hardware hitches, though since V Rising is only in early access, this isn’t going to be the usual appraisal of how it performs on various PC hardware. That can wait until it’s had more of the spit ‘n’ polish treatment that typically comes with the status of actually being finished. That said, I have done a full sweep of V Rising’s graphics settings and their performance impact, so if your FPS count is melting like a Nosferatu on an ill-considered Corfu holiday, have a look below to see if you can make some fruitful tweaks.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I saw him clamber around Mordor (I think; it was mountainous at the very least) and then stealth around an Elven king's abode. It was... fine.

My personal highlight, though, was talking to the Pinny Arcade collectors during the show's official trading event.\r\n\n\r\nI’ll admit, before I went to PAX I didn’t really appreciate how big Pinny Arcade was. I’d definitely seen photos of colourful metal pins depicting characters from various video games fly across my screen as I browsed Twitter, but I had never thought much about them beyond that. I was shocked, then, to arrive at PAX and realise just how integral this collectable is to the show. Merch booths sell starter packs, individual demo stations flog game specific rarities and avid fans adorn their lanyards with their favourite pieces. It turns out, Pinny Arcade is huge. \r\n\n \nRead more",

Maybe you're actually seated on a throne of graphic novels and comic books while you read this. Stranger things have happened. If that sounds like an accurate description of your fine self, then behold! Our corporate family at Reedpop have just launched Popverse, a new site dedicated to covering comic books, movies (films if you’re British) and anime and manga. \nThere’s already a starship's load of features about the Marvel Cinematic Universe, DC movies and Star Wars on there, so go have a readathon. The relaunched site also covers the professional wrestling scene, which is surely even more fantastical than Tolkien’s greatest works.\r\n\n \nRead more",

A killer robot is trying to kill a lady because of something her son will eventually do, that kind of thing. My favourite episodes of Doctor Who, by contrast, were always the ones where the Doctor met a miserable dog-alien thousands of years in the future, and the dog alien is like \"Not only is the planet about to blow, but my marriage is in trouble,\" and then the episode was mostly about the latter issue rather than the former. This is all by way of introduction to Eternal Threads, a puzzle game where you go back in time to stop everyone in a house share dying in a fire. \nTo save a present that has been rendered apocalyptic by time travel itself, you are part of a team who go back and change tiny things in the past to fix it, in this case 2015. While it is imperative for some reason that the fire does indeed happen, it is just as important that all six occupants live. You can alter small decisions they make in the week running up to the fire, and so save their lives by choosing whether they go to the pub, if they comfort each other in times of need, or what they have arguments about. The beat of a butterfly's wing, indeed.\nRead more",

          "description": "It's been about eight months since I first had a hands-off sneak peek at the new and about-to-be-rebooted Saints Row, and six since we've heard it was being delayed to August this year. With its late summer release fast approaching, Volition recently showed off a larger chunk of some actual gameplay to press in another remote preview session. It looks almost exactly like what you'd expect it to look like: a fun open world game where you shoot people and smash cars into other cars.\nBarring any catastrophic eventualities where this game actually ends up being just a load of bugs propping up other bugs in a fluorescent trenchcoat, I feel almost 100% confident in saying to you that this will be an enjoyable product when it comes out. But I also should be honest and say that the gameplay I saw has congealed into the same kind of sticky morass and blurred whirling lights in my memory as my first all-night benders. It's a big collage of colours and explosions, and words like \"cops\", \"switch car\" and \"plan\", leaving a general impression of fun but, so far, few specifics in its wake. And to be even more frank about it all, I can't think of a nailed on reason why any of it has to be a Saints Row game.\nRead more",

Vampire: The Masquerade - Swansong has taught me that they actually spend most of their time walking around looking at things, sometimes stopping to have tense conversations or pick up keycards. There is occasional eating.\nThis is probably because the three vampires you play as in Swansong aren't exactly on their down-time. Set in Boston in 2019, you begin in medias res after a sudden violent attack on a party has left the Boston vampire court reeling. The Prince, an Annie Lennox cosplayer called Hazel Iverson, has called three of her most trusted lieutenants in to firstly check on the immediate aftermath, and thereafter investigate the wider fallout and strike against whodunnit. Since developers Big Bad Wolf are the folks behind The Council, the role you take isn't an action hero but different shades of spy and/or detective. Neither leaves you much time to loaf about being all sexy, though. \nRead more",

It’s not the whole story when it comes to new players in the infamous space MMO, but it is the dominant one. \nAmong the many graphs that Finnbogason presented to the Eve faithful during his Fanfest keynote in Reykjavík this year, one was a colourful standout. It showed Eve Online’s learning curve as a comedy cliff face, so steep that it turned back on itself. Stickmen tumbled from its peak, while others were crucified or hanged from the curve’s mantel - killed by Eve’s notoriously cruel new player experience. It earned a laugh of grim recognition from the audience, all survivors of that terrible climb.\nRead more",

One characterised by little more than two palms on the knees once you've closed it down, then a big stand and a wordless stretch. But no!

I cannot remember any of the rules of poker, but I do really like the feel of cards, the shick schick shick of shuffling them and all the business of moving them around in your hand as if that'll change things very much. Card Shark, the latest game from the Reigns devs Nerial, is an ideal card game for me, as it does all the noises of shuffling and dealing and collecting cards extremely well, without requiring any knowledge or memory of the games its punters are actually playing. \nInstead, Card Shark is all about the palming and stacking and counting of cards, rather than an actual card game like your classic deckbuilders and such like. It will be out in full on June 2nd, but last week I got to play a larger version of the current Steam demo - about four hours worth of it, in fact - and I discovered that while I'm very bad at card games, I am pretty good at (pretend) cheating at them.\nRead more",

Currently in development for PC, Family Battle: Tag Arena promises multiplayer mayhem in a colorful anime world that hosts one too many superheroes.\nYou'll have to bear with me, as details are understandably muddled, but it appears that Family Battle, true to its title, is the tale of two extended families of superpowered heroes, facing off to determine who is the one true \"Super Family.\" This war will play out in a series of two-on-two arena-based battles, with teams stepping into the role of their chosen family members — all of which carry their own unique skills, abilities, powers, and play styles.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZKNRlCIdGQ\nWith one player in the role of \"Attacker\" and a second player as \"Support,\" the two teams engage in fast-paced and chaotic 3D warfare, utilizing both melee and ranged attacks as well as their own respective powers to take the fight. While the attacking characters get down and dirty on the front line, it is up to the supporting player to disrupt the enemy from long-range — laying traps, clearing out hazards, or providing their partner with offensive and defensive buffs. With strong chemistry and quick communication, a team can use its strategy and synergy to bring the bragging rights back home.\nFamily Battle: Tag Arena is currently in development for PC (via Steam). It will enter an Early Access period from August 6, but you can check out the official store page right now.

          "description": "Looking forward to a reboot of an iconic Call of Duty title\nFans of the Call of Duty series expect a new game every year, but there's always plenty of hype when the new release dates start rolling around. That's at least the case for me, maybe because I'm still a baby CoD fan, because I'm pumped to try out the new Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, especially now that it has a release date. They're really building the suspense on this one — first the logo reveal last month, now the art reveal, and then some potential new announcements teased for the future.\nThe Call of Duty Twitter officially revealed the next franchise entry's release date this morning: October 28, 2022. Along with that info, we also got a short video showing off the art for some of the game's characters, which includes a return of Task Force 141, who were also principal characters in the original Modern Warfare 2. We also caught a glimpse of a mysterious numbered sequence that reads \"J-8-22\" at around the 44-second mark, which just might be an important date for fans to look forward to.\nhttps://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/1529137835764228097\nThis title is actually a reboot sequel of the 2009 game with the exact same name, something that has caused a few fans (including myself) a bit of confusion this time around. Modern Warfare 2 is truly a beloved title in Call of Duty history, so it makes a lot of sense that Activision would want to bring it back for another go-around. We got some really iconic missions from that game, like \"Wolverines!\" and \"Cliffhanger,\" so here's hoping we get to see some other really memorable adventures this time around, too.\nI personally love a good sniper mission, but something I always look forward to in a good CoD campaign is those larger-than-life set pieces. Here's hoping that Infinity Ward can deliver this time around, and revamp the series in a way we've needed in the past few years.\nThe post The new Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 finally has a release date appeared first on Destructoid.",

Well, he isn't, but his suit and haircut sure are. Ubisoft has announced that it is collaborating with Sega to bring character skins of the Yakuza hero — as well as his one-time love interest and ass-kicking partner, Kaoru Sayama — to its popular online squad shooter.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rnZeKj9SWM\nThe Rainbow Six Siege Yakuza Bundle, which launches on all platforms today, includes looks for Siege's resident \"Team Japan,\" Hibana and Echo. In addition to the character skins, new weapon skins will kit Hibana out with a Police-themed rifle skin, while Echo gets a pearl-colored rifle skin emblazoned with the legendary Dragon of Dojima. Though these are, essentially, Siege characters in cosplay, it's still pretty weird to see even a dollar store Kazuma carrying a gun. Later this season, a new Elite skin will see Echo transform into the wildly unpredictable Goro Majima, as teased in the above trailer.\nThis is not the first time Rainbow Six Siege has ventured into \"guest skins\" territory. Back in 2020, Rainbow squad leader Ash got her Lara Croft on, while 2021 saw Zofia don the iconic S.T.A.R.S. garb of Resident Evil's Jill Valentine. These crossover costumes are part of Rainbow Six Siege's continued progression into a wider universe of lore — evolving from its nationalistic and stringently militant, roots into a more approachable, character-driven, alternate universe. Another example of this new direction lies in the icky, sci-fi sensibilities of 2021's Rainbow Six Extraction, which saw the counter-terrorist team battle a literal alien invasion.\nRainbow Six Siege and Rainbow Six Extraction are available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms. The Rainbow Six Siege Yakuza Bundle is available on all platforms today.\nThe post Yakuza’s Kazuma and Sayama are(n’t) joining the Rainbow Six Siege roster appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's one of the most Capcom things we'll see all week!\nAmid a historical breakdown of the several projects that the franchise has produced, we get a short message from the game's legendary director Hideaki Itsuno (who is still at Capcom, and still wants to make a sequel):\n\"Dragon's Dogma, first released in 2012, is celebrating its 10th anniversary! Thank you, Arisen, for taking up arms and braving through the impossible challenges laid ahead of you. We are forever grateful for your support throughout the years and hope you will join us in this momentous celebration of Dragon's Dogma!\"\n\nAs a reminder, Dragon's Dogma launched in 2012, and was eventually awarded an expansion-re-release of sorts with Dark Arisen. In 2015, Dragon's Dogma Online was released exclusively in Japan, which didn't help keep up the series' cachet worldwide. In 2020, an anime adaptation debuted on Netflix. We're still waiting for a cold hard sequel or a true follow-up.\nHopefully, this Dragon's Dogma 10th anniversary website is the start of that campaign. While the art is lovely, the site isn't too much to look at currently. Out of the six \"historical bullet points,\" three of them are for ports of Dark Arisen on various platforms.\nStill, sequel-begging aside, this series deserves to be celebrated in some fashion, and if this is all we're getting, at least it's something.\nThe post Capcom celebrates Dragon’s Dogma 10th anniversary with…a website and not a game appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "No more awkward post-fight goodbyes\nA new mod for Elden Ring aims to make co-op persist beyond the fog door, and it's going into beta this week. Modder LukeYui's seamless co-op mod for Elden Ring is going into public beta on May 27.\nYes, Elden Ring does already support co-op. But it is limited to certain areas and generally feels like it's meant for tackling bosses or tough areas, rather than exploring the Lands Between together. The seamless co-op mod for Elden Ring could change that.\nShown off in a video, LukeYui's mod allows for multiple players to ride their horses, get shared rewards from great enemies, and engage in PvP. Even when the host dies, they can spectate the other player.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHKuJO9nK-8\nThe mod will go live on NexusMods on May 27. No indication's been made towards how long it will stay up. But several alpha testers will also be streaming the co-op action. You can find their Twitch links in the mod's trailer description.\nThe Fellowship of the Elden Ring\nIt's a pretty cool thought that, if this mod pans out well, players could truly co-op great swathes of Elden Ring. While the drop-in co-op works right now, it's really only for spurts. Being able to run the entirety of an area, or just explore together, is something else entirely.\nOf course, Elden Ring has already been a hotbed for neat mods. Some let you summon bosses, or even infamous boss-killers. One project is trying to put FromSoftware's latest into the realm of virtual reality. And another went the hardware route, making a Fisher-Price controller work with Elden Ring.\nIt's safe to say Elden Ring is one of the year's biggest releases. As time rolls on though, I'm looking forward to more of what modders can do with the massive world FromSoft has made. And letting me and three of my friends engage in jolly co-op adventures is certainly a good pitch.\nThe post Elden Ring seamless co-op mod goes into beta this week appeared first on Destructoid.",

Patch 6.11a has removed the feature that logged folks out after 30 minutes of not doing anything, now that the servers have stabilized since the release of Endwalker. Square Enix says this applies to all areas of the game, including the Firmament.\nIn what can be described as a minor patch, the team also alters job balance a bit, mixes up PVP matchmaking (in Crystalline Conflict \"players in the Crystal tier can now be matched with players who are Diamond 3 (with 1 Rising Star) or higher\"), and several bugs have been addressed, including the Paladin Requiescat glitch.\nAs a general rule, multiple jobs have been buffed in PVP to bring their performance up and allow for more party variety. Gunbreaker, Bard, Machinist, Dancer, Summoner, and Black Mage have gotten potency (damage) increases across the board; with the latter getting massive changes to multiple abilities (including cast time reductions and even added functionality). The Red Mage was nerfed a bit (only with the corps-a-corps ability, reducing its damage reduction from 20% to 10%).\nThe FFXIV inactivity timer is easily the biggest deal of the patch though. While 30 minutes is a decent chunk of time, it's not enough to go out to eat and come back! Sometimes, especially in a social situation like waiting to start a raid, it can be useful to stay logged in just to receive/eventually read messages from friends.\nThe post The latest FFXIV patch alters jobs in PVP, removes inactivity timer appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Dat's not fay-rrrrreeee!\nWarner Bros. Interactive's madcap brawler MultiVersus might only be in its pre-release stages, but already players and developers are noticing that some members of its colorful roster are just a little too handy with the ol' fisticuffs, and are currently on The List to receive a good old fashioned nerfing.\nResponding to feedback from the game's recent closed alpha, MultiVersus director Tony Huynh has noted that four characters, in particular, seem to be dishing out far more doses of digital pain than others. First on the list is DC Comics' anti-hero Harley Quinn, who is joined by Adventure Time heroes Finn and Jake, and finally, Original MultiVersus Character Do Not Steal Reindog. Huynh notes that this quartet will receive larger \"punish windows,\" which one would assume means that they will be easier to counter when they whiff their zany attacks.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvborgKG7fw\nOf course, this is just the tip of the iceberg, and MultiVersus is likely to see a ton of adjustments as it progresses from Alpha to Beta, and from Beta to Launch. Alongside character balance updates, developer Player First Games will also be looking at fixing bugs, improving stability, tweaking matchmaking, and all other elements that make up the core essentials of any successful fighting game.\nWhile MultiVersus is, admittedly, pushing into a ridiculously crowded market, the closed alpha has shown promise, even hooking in a party of non-fighting game players. It's a star-studded slapfest, that's for sure, and I'm looking forward to following the title's progression toward its eventual release, scheduled for later in 2022.\nMultiVersus is currently in development for PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

Sadly, Switch users will have to wait for an indeterminate amount of time beyond that initial Gollum game release date, as that version has been delayed until \"later this year.\"\nI'm still really interested in the tricksy nature of the creation of this game from a macro standpoint. Adapting a Tolkien work is always difficult given that the action-based motifs of most video games weren't glorified in the source material: but playing as a villain (a conflicted one at that) could allow the development team to do some cool things with Gollum and the narrative.\nThat said, it'll be tough to balance the potential \"stealth gameplay\" (which is always hard to get right in the best of circumstances) and the aforementioned narrative elements: hopefully they're up to the task. The \"partnership with Middle-earth Enterprises\" (read: not the Tolkien Estate) could help with some oversight, though most of their input could be dictating what material the team does/doesn't have the rights for.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJn2AjYOIJA\nThe post Lord of the Rings Gollum game release date is September, Switch delayed appeared first on Destructoid.",

In fact, the sequel to the 2003 action-adventure has gone so dark, that fans are already wondering whether the title is heading for an extended development of Dead Island 2 proportions.\nHowever, it seems that the cyberpunkian project is both far from canned and equally far from completion. A new job listing from Ubisoft Barcelona sees the developer reaching out for a \"Senior Gameplay Animator to jump on board with Jade and company, with the listing suggesting that Beyond Good and Evil 2 will be one of Ubisoft's \"most ambitious games to date.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QgaMMuXzuo\nIt is believed that no less than five of Ubisoft's studios are currently working on the project, which has only seen a single cinematic trailer, released way back at E3 2018. While franchise creator Michel Ancel has now left the industry entirely, it seems that production on the purgatory follow-up is progressing. It's difficult to deny that, at this rate, fans may be better off simply holding off on their anticipation until Ubisoft finally has any in-game footage to share.\nA Beyond Good and Evil cinematic adaptation is also currently in pre-production for the video-streaming service, Netflix.

          "description": "Does literally every publisher need a stream? The answer is no\nWith E3 dead and buried for this year, it's all about Geoff Keighley's Summer Game Fest 2022, and whatever scattered streams decide to casually show up around it. Thankfully, there might be less of the latter in 2022.\nSpeaking on Twitter Spaces (as reported by VGC),  Keighley does what he does best: hype up his Summer Game Fest event. But this time he provides cold hard facts that actually highlight what this year's festival could look like, and things seem good in terms of making it actually feel E3-esque in 2022. Point blank, he explains:\n\"There were a lot of shows last year where everyone was disappointed when they weren’t really press conferences, right? Like Take-Two, Capcom, Square Enix and things like that...I think [they] have learned that if you’re going to do a press conference, you kind of need to have 30 minutes-plus of stuff, and sometimes they only have one or two great games to show, which may not be enough to do a full event around. So I think that’s going to be a bit of a shift. I have a pretty good sense of what’s coming in the next month, and I think people will be hyped about games in general.\"\n\nIt's kind of a bold statement in a way — noting that Summer Game Fest is bigger than, say, a Square Enix conference — but he's absolutely right about people being disappointed in general by smaller showcases; a reaction even companies like EA aren't immune to.\nNow, we could still get a billion streams anyway, despite this claim. But this has me hopeful that at the very least, several publishers will \"fold\" into a bigger event, if only because they realized they can't cut it on their own in the past.\nThe post Geoff Keighley says 2022’s Summer Game Fest will be more killer, less filler appeared first on Destructoid.",

Personally, I’m still partial to Ninja Baseball Bat Man, but as somebody who’s sunk more than a dozen hours into cleaning up the streets of Wood Oak City, its greatness is easy to recognize. Not only did SoR4 help revitalize a genre that once dominated the industry, but it also effectively tapped into the beat ‘em up’s roots as the precursor to the modern fighting game genre.\nUpon its release in 2020, the game was showered with glowing reviews and strong sales, moving more than two and a half million copies in its first year on the market.

The Danshi are mankind’s greatest weapon against the History Retrograde Army, a group of absurd-looking skeletal bugs that are traveling backward in time to change the course of history. As the Saniwa, it is up to you to protect the historical timeline by sending your Danshi back through previous eras of Japanese history to defeat them, even if it means restoring unquestionably cruel moments from the past.\nThe game was given an international release just last year, which is when I first became acquainted with it.

          "description": "A glimpse at some gorgeous gameplay while we wait\nWhen Tchia was announced at the Game Awards back in 2020, I immediately added it to my list of beautiful, relaxing games that I'm looking forward to. It's billed on Steam as a \"tropical open-world adventure\" which, as someone who loves all things sand and surf, is enough on its own to get me interested in learning more about the game. All of the other fun adventures the game promises, well, those are just icing on the cake.\nUnfortunately, the game's developer Awaceb just announced that Tchia has been delayed to early 2023, so we're going to have to wait a little bit longer to embark on our tropical adventure. The good news is they did drop off a new mini-feature that highlights a key component of Tchia's gameplay: ocean exploration.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQXFd4jn-mY\nThe short trailer shows clips of the titular character Tchia sailing around gorgeous tide pools, diving into the water in search of lost treasure, and even different customization options for the boat's sails and flags. Of all the open-world games I've played, Tchia looks to be the most relaxed and easy-going, which we can always use more of in an industry of titles focused so heavily on combat.\nThe news of the delay may not be ideal, but it does look like Tchia is going to be worth the wait. On top of the ocean exploration portion of the gameplay, we can also look forward to other fun mechanics like transforming into different animals and objects, climbing and gliding around the oceanside cliffs, and strumming on a fully playable ukulele.\nWe can definitely see the impact of titles like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Super Mario Odyssey in Tchia, and I personally can't wait to see what new spin Awaceb puts on gameplay mechanics that we've come to know and love.\nTchia will be available in early 2023 for PC, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.\nThe post Tchia gets an ocean exploration mini-trailer amidst delay news appeared first on Destructoid.",

The final vote came down 19 for, 3 against.\nThe vote was held today, over a webcast stream. The group, Game Workers Alliance, marks the first union at a major games studio in North America and one of only a few around, including Vodeo Games staff.\nhttps://twitter.com/WeAreGWA/status/1528825165798223872\nIt's a big move, especially as The Washington Post reported that Activision Blizzard management had been discouraging employees from voting in favor of the union. A Bloomberg report from earlier today says that the National Labor Relations Board is preparing an official complaint unless Activision settles. An Activision spokesperson denied the allegations in a statement to Bloomberg.\nA long road\nIt's been a long road for Raven employees, starting with sudden layoffs at the end of last year. Workers at Raven's QA department, which works on titles like Call of Duty: Warzone, held a walkout and eventually went on strike calling for worker representation.\nThe strike ended when the QA testers formed a union, Game Workers Alliance, under the Communication Workers of America. The union called on Activision Blizzard for official recognition.\nActivision Blizzard did recently confirm it would be moving many of its U.S. QA workers to full-time positions. But the company also said it would not voluntarily recognize Raven Software's QA union, leading to today's vote.\nThe publisher has been the subject of acute scrutiny for some time now. A lawsuit filed by the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing kickstarted a series of lawsuits and reports.\nMicrosoft announced earlier this year that it plans to purchase Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion. Microsoft told The Washington Post earlier this year that it would \"not stand in the way\" of an Activision Blizzard union.\nThe post Raven Software QA employees vote to unionize appeared first on Destructoid.",

AT&T announced today that Control Ultimate Edition is free to stream in its entirety to a phone, tablet, or computer for AT&T customers.\nAccording to AT&T's site, you just need a postpaid mobility plan. Then you can head to its Play Now site using a mobile device or computer. Enter your phone number and zip code for your account, and bam, Control Ultimate Edition.\nIt's available for a limited time, and powered by Google's Immersive Stream for Games. That program is a spin-off of Stadia, where companies can license Google's Stadia streaming tech for their own streaming purposes.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UISRDU_mzaw\nThis isn't the only game available, either. Batman: Arkham Knight is also on the program, as it launched last fall.\nCloudy future\nCloud gaming has been an interesting technology to watch develop over the years. Stadia itself went through some woes, shuttering its internal studios and looking to expand in other ways.\nA report in February indicated Google might be pivoting and adapting the technology, bringing the tech to services looking for streaming options. It certainly seems like this Control offer falls under that.\nOther companies have tried out their cloud tech, too. Microsoft's Xbox Cloud Gaming has made Xbox One and Series X|S games open for streaming through the cloud.\nFor AT&T, it's a very specific subset of users able to take advantage of this. But it is interesting, as a microcosm of where these options could go: mobile.

We'll see more of both of them shortly, as Games Workshop is putting together a Warhammer Skulls showcase on June 1.\nWarhammer 40,000: Darktide and Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 are the showpiece games here — especially since they're new and they look cool — but the event will also cover the \"latest updates and future plans\" for some already released games, too. In its announcement, Games Workshop specifically pointed to Total War: Warhammer III, Warhammer 40,000: Battlesector, and Warhammer: Vermintide 2. We'll see what we get.\n[caption id=\"attachment_323256\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1920\"] That's a lot of logos![/caption]\nWhen to show up\nThe Warhammer Skulls event will begin at 10:00 a.m. Pacific on Wednesday, June 1, with \"week-long offers\" and new game content to follow. You can catch it live on Twitch.\nEven if you're only interested in seeing a new trailer or two, you may want to swing by for the wider showcase — Clive Standen (of Vikings fame) will be involved. (If you missed it, he's Captain Titus in Space Marine 2.) Considering how quickly our summer calendar is filling up, though, I don't fault anyone for being a bit more choosy with their time.\nDarktide isn't too far off with a September 13, 2022 release date, but Space Marine 2 feels much less tangible at this point — Saber Interactive is still listing a TBA launch.\nI'm ready to cull the hordes in both of these games.

          "description": "Hogwarts Legacy releases this holiday for multiple platforms, but PlayStation 5 players will experience additional technical magic thanks to the game’s suite of DualSense features.\nA PlayStation Blog post revealed the different ways Hogwarts Legacy takes advantage of the controller’s haptic feedback. For starters, spells sport individual physical button resistances and feedback to make them feel unique from one another. In a nice touch, these haptic effects are isolated to the right side of the controller to simulate wielding a wand in one hand more accurately. Hopefully, this feature can be flipped to the other side of the gamepad so that left-handed players can experience the same immersion. \n\n\nThe DualSense light bar displays various flash effects for each spell, but it also radiates the color of your chosen house. For the uninitiated, that’s red for Gryffindor, green for Slytherin, yellow for Hufflepuff, and blue for Ravenclaw. \nThe controller will also simulate sensations such as crushing botany ingredients in potions class, deflecting and disintegrating incoming magic using the shield spell Portico, and soaring the skies atop a broom or hippogriff. Hogwarts Legacy also leverages the PS5’s 3D audio to pick up smaller sound effects such as a crackling fireplace and other environmental sound cues.  \nTo learn more and watch additional video clips of these features in action, be sure to visit the PlayStation Blog post. Hogwarts Legacy doesn’t have a release date, but it’s slated to arrive sometime this holiday. You can play it on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. You can watch an extended gameplay demonstration in March’s State of Play video here.",

Ships...? The video in the tweet features a cargo ship? You’ll love the joke if you watch the clip. In the said video, there’s a reveal of many familiar faces from Task Force 141 showing up in Modern Warfare II. As the drone footage zips through the Port of Long Beach, the camera focuses on the sides of shipping containers displaying the portraits of Captain John Price, Simon “Ghost” Riley, John “Soap” MacTavish, Kyle ‘Gaz’ Garrick, and, according to the YouTube description for the video, the introduction of Mexican Special Forces Colonel Alejandro Vargas.\nFor a better look at the cast of Modern Warfare II, check out the gallery below.\n\nWhile we now know Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II “ships” on October 28, we don’t know much of anything about the setting, story, and multiplayer, and still don’t have any known platforms for its release.

The Switch version will arrive sometime later in the year.\n\n\nThe game was first announced in 2019 and was originally slated to arrive in 2021 before being delayed into this year. The story follows J.R.R. Tolkein’s books rather than Peter Jackson’s film trilogy, detailing Gollum’s happenings during the first chapters of The Fellowship of the Ring after he loses the One Ring to Bilbo Baggins. Gollum embarks on a journey across Middle-earth, visiting locations such as Mirkwood and Barad-dûr. \nGameplay-wise, Gollum is a stealth adventure game as players sneak around environments and can choose to avoid or engage enemies. The choice depends on if you indulge Gollum’s vicious nature or the more timid tendencies of his other personality, Smeagol. Climbing and platforming are also a big part of the experience as players can scale structures, adding verticality to exploration. \nWe last saw The Lord of the Rings: Gollum in action in 2021 during a hands-off preview demo. You can read our impressions of it from that time here.",

          "description": "Marvel Studios has released a new Thor: Love and Thunder trailer that runs more than two minutes long and features a ton of new footage, especially compared to the teaser trailer released last month. \nThe new trailer features extended looks at scenes from the teaser, like when Thor realizes Jane Foster is back and now wielding Mjolnir. It also contains new footage of Korg, the Guardians of the Galaxy, and the villain of Taika Waititi’s latest Thor film, Gorr the God Butcher.\n\n\nFor comic fans, one look at Christian Bale’s Gorr, and it’s immediately apparent that this is a very different take. Gorr is typically more alien-looking but still humanoid. Bale’s Gorr looks very much like a human, and it’s not surprising because if you’re going to hire someone like Bale to play a villain, why not squeeze out as much as you can by reminding folks that this is Bale. \nHowever, regardless of where you fall on “he’s too human” or “I like it,” it’s hard to disagree that Bale’s Gorr is appropriately metal. Right off the bat, Gorr the God Butcher is an incredible title to hold if you’re a villain. Couple that with his first announcement – that all gods need to die, including Thor – and his design, which features black-tipped fingers, a planet-shattering weapon, and a black liquid that runs out of his mouth, and Gorr might be the most metal MCU villain yet. \n\nFor more, watch the first Thor: Love and Thunder teaser trailer and then listen to this episode of From Panel To Podcast, which is Game Informer’s comic book podcast, to hear us talk about Thor: Love and Thunder. \nWhat did you think of this trailer?

Zynga is notable for its globally enjoyed small screen titles like Farmville and CSR Racing 2, the most popular mobile racing game. Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick voiced his company's excitement about the deal, stating:\n\"We are thrilled to complete our combination with Zynga, which is a pivotal step to increase exponentially our Net Bookings from mobile, the fastest-growing segment in interactive entertainment, while also providing us with substantial cost synergies and revenue opportunities. As we bring together our exceptional talent, exciting pipelines of games, and industry-leading technologies and capabilities, we believe that we can take our portfolio to another level of creativity, innovation, and quality.\"\nZynga CEO Frank Gibeau responded in kind, \"We are excited for Zynga's next-generation mobile platform, free-to-play expertise, diverse offering of games and incredible team to join the Take-Two family. We are eager to continue building an unparalleled portfolio of games that will reach broader markets and lead to continued growth for this next chapter of Zynga's history.\"\nPerhaps we'll see more mobile ports or versions of Take-Two titles in the coming years. This deal comes hot off of financial reports that revealed the launch of more than 69 Take-Two games over the next three years. Only time will tell what fruit is born of this monumental merger. Acquisition culture is growing in the games industry. Sony recently hired a Corporate Development Director to spearhead growth opportunities through acquisitions, and Microsoft's Phil Spencer reiterated Xbox's commitment to buying studios that are \"a good fit.\" \n[Source: PC Gamer]",

          "description": "I was just telling a friend that I would love to see a Lobo television show that draws inspiration from The Mandalorian and Deadpool. Picture an intergalactic bounty hunter with an attitude problem – that's basically Lobo. He first appeared in an Omega Men comic book in 1983, and after bouncing through dozens of DC comic book series for decades, finally made his live-action debut in an episode of Krypton. The point being: We need more Lobo.\nHe's a wild character who almost starred in his own video game in 1996. Ocean of America was hard at work on a fighting game starring Lobo for Super Nintendo and Genesis. As the fact sheets below show, the developer apparently had most of the gameplay details worked out. The canceled project included moves like \"Ram Grenade Down Throat,\" \"Blow Opponent in Half,\" and \"Fire Hole Through Opponent.\" The setup is what you would expect: Lobo must kill everyone who stands in his way. He even has to murder a clone of himself. Below are a number of fact sheets from Game Informer's archives that outline the project, and a gameplay video from a prototype.\nI doubt we'll ever see Lobo in a game, but there's a chance more DC characters like Wonder Woman will get their own projects. Which DC hero do you think deserves a shot at a game next? Let us know in the comments section below.",

The mashup you’ve pictured in your head a hundred times – Street Fighter vs. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles – is becoming an action figure reality. That’s because Playmates Toys is releasing four SF vs TMNT character sets and two are coming later this year. \nThe four sets respectively are:\nRyu vs. Leonardo – the leaders face off\nChun-Li vs. Michelangelo – authority vs. exuberance\nGuile vs Raphael – strength vs. strength\nKen Masters vs. Donatello – restraint vs. intellect\n\nThe two releasing this fall are Ryu vs. Leonardo and Chun-Li vs Michelangelo, and it is then that they’ll hit retail shelves. Unfortunately, as you can see above, those are the only two sets with images so far. As for where, Playmates Toys doesn’t say in today’s news, but it’s likely they’ll end up where Playmates Toys figures are typically sold near you. \n“Each figure in the collection stands six inches tall and is highly poseable with multiple points of articulation – from ball joints at the head, shoulders and hips, to split joint elbows and knees, and at the wrist, ankles, upper arms, and thighs,” a press release reads. “Authentically detailed and decorated as seen in the Street Fighter II video game, Street Fighter vs. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is packed out in an ‘80s video game console-shaped window box packaging.” \nThis collection, which encompasses four SF vs. TMNT faceoffs, was created in celebration of Street Fighter’s 35th Anniversary, which is this year. \nWhat SF vs. TMNT matchups would you like to see?

In a new partnership with Warner Bros., Looney Tunes are coming to the high-octane toy racer in July.\nA brief teaser trailer shows off the ACME warehouse, and as the camera pans down, we hear the telltale sounds of the Roadrunner and Wile E. Coyote before they're seen giving chase in car form on a Hot Wheels track. The Looney Tunes Expansion contains five new Tune-flavored cars, a themed track builder module, themed profile and basement customization items, along with the Looney Tunes Adventure Park environment to cruise around. The Adventure Park features four environments with different themes, one of which being a desert area to recreate Roadrunner and Wile E. chases of your own.\nHot Wheels released a set of six physical Looney Tunes cars in 2017, with the two vehicles shown in the trailer among the group. The others not announced from that set include Bugs Bunny, Taz the Tazmanian Devil, Marvin the Martian, and Daffy Duck. If I were a betting man, I'd assume the other three cars will come from these remaining four collectibles as well.\nThe Looney Tunes Expansion will be available on July 14 and can be purchased as a piecemeal DLC for Hot Wheels Unleashed but is also tied to the upcoming Hot Wheels Pass vol. 3 (available for purchase on June 9), which includes more vehicles, customizations, and Track Builder Modules.

          "description": "2D Action RPG Lost Epic is graduating from Steam Early Access and going 1.0 this July. The launch also brings the game to PlayStation platforms, marking the game’s first appearance on consoles. \nLost Epic first launched in Early Access in June 2021, and it blends Metroidvania-style exploration, Souls-inspired fast-paced combat, and a vibrant anime presentation. Players control a God Slayer on a quest to defeat a pantheon of divine gods threatening humanity. The hack ‘n slash combat encourages thoughtful combo-building and utilization of a parry mechanic to slay Lost Epic’s challenging enemies. God Slayers are fully customizable thanks to a deep skill tree, and you can craft enchantments and other items to bolster your arsenal. You can even tackle the campaign alongside friends in three-player online co-op. Check out the release date trailer below to see Lost Epic in action. \n\n\nBefore launch, Steam Early Access players can now enjoy a new update, Ver 1.3.0, that adds a new world: the Abyss. This patch adds new bosses and the Eyes of God item used to uncover additional unseen paths leading to the game’s final world. You can watch the video for that below. \n\n\nAt launch, Lost Epic receives a new world called the Sky Spire. The new area contains a powerful raid boss to tackle alone or alongside allies. Players can wield new weapons such as the Regalia blade, staff, shield, and new weapon enhancement materials. Lastly, characters from developer Team Earth Wars’ previous title, Earth’s Dawn, will become playable.  \nYou can play the final version of Lost Epic on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC on July 28. The developer also plans to raise the game's price at launch. The new price isn’t listed, but Lost Epic is $19.99 on Steam (though it’s currently discounted to $14.99 until May 27). That means you’ll want to grab it on PC now if you think the game is up your alley.",

Then, Sony revealed some of its PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, and classic games lineup, including a selection of PS1 games, that would be coming to the service. That list wasn’t exhaustive, though, and now, two more classic games have seemingly leaked, as reported by Eurogamer. \nFunnily enough, it appears to have been PlayStation itself that accidentally leaked the two new classic games – Oddworld: Abe’s Odyssey (PS1) and Ridge Racer 2 (PSP) – because fans found both listed on the Malaysian PSN store. At the time of this writing, the Abe’s Odyssey page is still up but the Ridge Racer 2 page takes you to a window that says “Not available for purchase” and nothing else. You can also view the Malaysian PSN’s listing of two previously announced PS1 games coming to PS Plus next month – Worms Armageddon and Worms World Party. \nAs Eurogamer notes, in the ResetEra post where these (seemingly) accidental leaks were first found by players, you can view multiple screenshots from the Ridge Racer 2 listing. \nOver on Video Games Chronicle, you can view nearly 10 minutes of Abe’s Odyssey in action, including a look at its emulation and how the rewind feature works.  \nWhile PlayStation has yet to officially confirm whether Abe’s Odyssey and Ridge Racer 2 are coming to PS Plus, it seems all but guaranteed. The Malaysian PSN page for Abe's Odyssey even shows “PS1 Emulation” in the title. While waiting to see if these two games hit the revamped PS Plus service here in the West, read Game Informer’s breakdown of all the games announced for PS Plus so far and then read about the three different PS Plus tiers to determine which one is the best for you.\n[Source: Eurogamer]\nAre you excited about these two games?

We're doing things differently this time as we're discussing the gameography of a developer rather than covering an individual game series. That studio is Supergiant Games, the acclaimed indie developer of Bastion, Transistor, Pyre, and Hades. This week, we conclude our season by analyzing 2020's Hades. \nUnlike Supergiant Games' previous titles, Hades had two release dates. Its first release came on December 6, 2018 when it launched in early access on PC, while the full game was available to be played on September 17, 2020. Hades takes everything the studio has learned up to this point and blends them into an ambitious rogue-lite that's developed in a way the team has never experienced before: with the gaming public playing the game as it's being made. Check out this episode to learn the backstory of how Pyre's large cast of characters inspired the evolving narrative of Zagreus and his dysfunctional diety family, how the studio fared developing an early access game, and learn all about Greek mythology from our guest, the incomparable Jill Grodt.\nJoin hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), John Carson (@John_Carson), along with Game Informer associate editor Jill Grodt (@Finruin) for a verbal stroll through the history and narrative of Hades!\nIf you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com.

Microsoft is in the process of acquiring Activision Blizzard, Discovery and Time Warner have recently finished merging into one mega-media empire, and Sony is bringing Destiny developer Bungie into the PlayStation family. What we didn't know about is a now-failed bid for NBC Universal to strengthen its hand by folding Electronic Arts into its corporate umbrella. \nAccording to a report from Dylan Byers at Puck News, the merging of EA into NBC Universal was well in motion until the deal fell apart in April. Brian Roberts, chairman and CEO of Comcast Corporation, is said to have wanted to inject the business with an influx of new IP and brands for some time now, and EA was in the crosshairs most rec…",

Join us for another special episode of The GI Show, where we're reviewing both episode nine of Halo and season one as a whole.\n\n\nThe regular team is back to wrap up the season, but we couldn't do a Halo review without a familiar friend. Alex Stadnik, Brian Shea, and Andrew Reiner are joined by Kate Sánchez, founder of But Why Tho? to break down the highs and lows of this episode and the season in this spoiler-filled discussion.\nIn episode nine, we find John and company reeling from the fallout of Makee's decision, setting the stage for the final battle. The good news is that \"Transcendence\" has plenty of satisfying action that genuinely feels like what we love about Halo as a video game. The bad news is those questionable story choices continue to bring down our enjoyment of the series.\nWhen looking at the first season as a whole, it's clear that plenty of things could have been better. In that spirit, we finish out this episode of The GI Show and our Halo review with our thoughts on the state of Master Chief, Halsey, and Co.'s tale and whether or not we're excited about a second season. We also grade the show on the GI review scale for those dying to know what we thought numerically.\nThank you so much for joining us on this journey. While the show had its ups and downs, it was so fun to get to chat with the community on a weekly basis. We hope you enjoyed these videos, and we're so excited to continue our review series in the not too distant future. \nWhat do you think about Halo? Be sure to let us know in the comments below. We'd also love your feedback on the extra GI Show episodes. Do you like them? Do you want to see us focus on games or the Marvel shows in the future?

And now, today, you get to watch more than 20 minutes of our gameplay!\n\n\nAs you'll soon hear, not only did your hosts, Game Informer editors Wesley LeBlanc and Alex Stadnik, get the chance to go hands-on with Fueled Up, they were joined by two of the devs from Fireline Games – Kacper Kowalczuk and Chris Heldt – to round out the four-person team. If you're wondering how we did so well playing Fueled Up, just know it's because Wesley and Alex are really good at video games and totally not because they had two people who actually created this game helping them. \nVIDEO\nEnjoy this first look at Fueled Up gameplay on PC as Wesley and Alex ask them questions about the game, how the four-person development studio developed it, what they're hoping to add to the cooperative multiplayer space, and more. Be on the lookout for Fueled Up when it hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC sometime this year. \nFor more about Fueled Up, be sure to watch the reveal trailer from last month.

          "description": "A not-so-long time ago in the same galaxy we all reside in, Respawn Entertainment deviated from its first-person shooter roots to create Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66. After he’s outed by the Sith, he embarks on a quest to recover an artifact capable of locating force-sensitive children while also avoiding capture by the Inquisitors, who are elite Jedi hunters. \nThe game features a blend of lightsaber combat and a suite of Force abilities. Borrowing inspiration from FromSoftware’s Soul series, encounters are challenging, requiring a strategic blend of blocks and parries to outduel opponents. Meanwhile, the various planets take on a Metroid-inspired progression with players unlocking abilities to backtrack to previously inaccessible areas. \nWatch on Twitch!\nFallen Order was released on November 15, 2019, and was a critical and financial success. It also served as a saving grace for single-player fans, providing proof to an increasingly multiplayer-focused EA that linear story-driven experiences can still make the big bucks. With a sequel reportedly in the works, we’re revisiting this gem of the Star Wars video game pantheon. \nJoin Marcus Stewart, Andrew Reiner, and John Carson on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central as we journey through the entirety of Cal Kestis’ adventure. Expect plenty of laughs, deaths, and general nerding out over all things Star Wars. We encourage you to hang out with us in chat.

Since its release, and subsequent Director’s Cut rerelease, fans have wondered what was next for Hideo Kojima, the director of Death Stranding and the Metal Gear Solid series. \nIt seems that what’s next might be a sequel to Death Stranding. That’s because in a new interview with Leo, Death Stranding actor Norman Reedus, who plays Sam Bridges in the game, seems to have confirmed a second one is now in production, as spotted first by GamerUP on Twitter. When asked about Death Stranding, Reedus said “we just started the second one” before diving deeper into how he got involved with the first Death Stranding. \nDeath Stranding 2, or a sequel to Death Stranding, has not been officially revealed or even hinted at by PlayStation or Kojima. Of course, Kojima could be working on other games right now too – in fact, he recently hinted that he might be working on two upcoming games – and those might even release before this Death Stranding sequel if what Reedus said is true. Only time will tell for now but it’s great to be a Death Stranding fan, it seems. \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer’s Death Stranding review and then read our impressions of Death Stranding Director’s Cut. Read about how Kojima might be working on two upcoming games after that. \n[Source: Leo via GamerUP]\nDo you want a sequel to Death Stranding? Let us know in the comments below!",

The lights begin turning off on Monday, May 23, when players lose the ability to add eShop funds using credit cards.\nIf you’ve recently turned on your 3DS or Wii U, you likely received a notification reminding you that your stored credit cards will soon become useless. You’ll still be able to add money using Nintendo eShop gift cards – that option won’t disappear until August 29. But if you want to take advantage of the convenience of using your own payment methods without taking a trip to the store, this weekend is your last chance to unleash a final spending spree. Nintendo has not specified the exact time on Monday that credit cards will be disabled.  \nKeep in mind that even once credit and gift card options go away, players can link their Nintendo Network ID wallet (used for the 3DS/Wii U stores) with their Nintendo Account wallet (used to buy Switch games). The combined balance of both wallets can be used buy software on all three platforms. Once August passes, this will be the only method of buying 3DS/Wii U games until the March deadline. Afterward, whatever funds remain can only be spent on Switch purchases. \nAs a final reminder, you will still be able to play 3DS/Wii U games online and redownload purchased games, DLC, and updates after March 2023. Nintendo states this will remain the case for “the foreseeable future.”\nFor more information, visit Nintendo’s Q&A support page for the shutdown process.",

Ryu’s new model looks very impressive, and wow, is he a wide dude. He’s becoming one thick, square, sweaty muscle. Luke, on the other hand, looks way different from his recent debut in SFV, sporting a much more realistic hairstyle and veiny arms that would make John Cena jealous.

          "description": "Yesterday, Marvel teased that it would be announcing a new video game today, and it has done just that with Marvel Snap, a new free-to-play collectible card game for PC and mobile devices developed by Nuverse and Second Dinner. \nMarvel calls it a “revolutionary game experience that unleashes the entire Marvel multiverse into a fast-paced, adrenaline-pumping card battle” that tasks players with assembling their ultimate Marvel dream team complete with both heroes and villains. To do so, players will need to collect “endless” card variants and use them in collectible card game plays. Each card game match lasts about three minutes. It is set to launch later this year. \n\n\n“Featuring 150+ iconic Marvel characters, Marvel Snap brings together stunning art from Marvel’s rich 80-year history with beautiful, brand new original illustrations to deliver hundreds of collectible art pieces in an intense player vs. player (PVP) fast-paced CCG,” a press release reads. “Marvel Snap introduces a new way to compete for the highest ranks, allowing players to ‘Snap’ to raise the stakes and double down. The mind games and bluffing inherent in this innovative mechanic create a game that is truly impossible to master.” \n\nAt launch, Marvel Snap will feature more than 150 “unique cards,” and each will have multiple variations. According to the press release, each match will feature three of more than 50 random Marvel locations with game-changing effects. \n\nBeginning today, you can sign up for a limited edition closed beta on Android devices here. When the game launches later this year, it will be available in 13 different languages on PC and mobile devices. \nIn regards to the development teams, Nuverse is perhaps best known for its work on mobile titles such as Sonic at the Olympic Games – Tokyo 2020, One Piece: Blood Routes, and Warhammer 40,000: Lost Crusade. Second Dinner is comprised of developers that have worked on Hearthstone, World of Warcraft, Halo, and more. \nAre you excited for Marvel Snap? Let us know in the comments below!",

          "description": "A few days ago, Google announced the list of students accepted for this year's Google Summer of Code.\nWe are very proud to welcome 4 students this year who will be working on various parts of the project during the upcoming months.\nPragyansh Chaturvedi (aka Raikou) will work on improving our DIRECTOR engine. His effort will help us to allow support for many 90s-era adventure games made with the Macromedia Director authoring tools. By implementing more internal functions used by DIRECTOR, Pragyansh's main objective is to extend support for Meet Mediaband and The Journeyman Project (Win and Mac), making them fully playable without any glitches.\nMichael Hayman (aka Quote58) is about to implement support for The Immortal. The game (released in 1990) can be described as a mix of genres involving RPG elements with action and puzzles. Many changes across different game variants (written in pure assembly code!) will make this an interesting challenge. This project is a continuation of a GSoC task initially started by a former student back in 2018.\nEmanuele Grisenti (aka grisenti) will be working on a new engine, HPL1. The original sources for this engine got recently released by the original developer Frictional Games under GPLv3. The purpose of this project is to achieve a full port of this engine to ScummVM, with the goal of supporting the 2007 survival game Penumbra: Overture.\nAvijeet Maurya (aka StableSteady) will pick up several incomplete engines: MacVenture, Avalanche, Glk-Scott, Pink and WAGE. Some of these engines are very close to completion, but not quite there yet. The main objective of Avijeet's task is to identify all missing features and fix existing bugs. The goal for his project is to bring the above engines to a stable state.\nThe team is very excited about the upcoming weeks – and we hope you are as well.\nPlease give a warm welcome to our new students! Let's make GSoC 2022 a huge success – together!\n>",
