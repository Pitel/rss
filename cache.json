          "description": "We'd die for Traffikrab.\nThere’s something that feels right about a monster-battling creature-collecting game coming to a Nintendo console. Originally released for PC on 26 April 2023, Cassette Beasts has made its way to the Nintendo Switch where it belongs. At first glance, Cassette Beasts clearly draws quite a lot of inspiration from Pokémon, yet assuming it’s a Pokéclone would be a mistake. While you explore an overworld teeming with cute and cool critters to battle and capture (or ‘record,’ in this case) and go up against an increasingly difficult array of opposing ‘trainers,' it’s a mishmash of mostly refreshing ideas outside of these basics.\nAfter creating your little pixel avatar, you wake up on the beach of an island called New Wirral. Cassette Beasts’ story gets a little ridiculous right away: you find yourself marooned and separated from the real world, on an island filled with monsters that you can turn into if you record them on tapes and slot them into cassette players. At first, it seems like there’s no way home, but together with a young woman named Kayleigh, you learn that there might be a way out after all through defeating a bunch of otherworldly creatures called Archangels. These Archangels take on eldritch-like forms rather than cute ones, setting them apart from the rest of the monsters you collect.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

We were worried when developer and publisher Daedalic Entertainment announced that The Lord of the Rings: Gollum would be arriving on the Switch after its release on other platforms. Now that it's out on PS5, Xbox, and PC, however, we're dreading what an eventual Switch version will look and play like.\nLet's not mince our words here: it seems like The Lord of the Rings: Gollum is a pretty awful game. Indeed, at the time of writing, it's currently sitting at a rather bad score of 38 for the PS5 version on Metacritic (which, according to VGC, makes it the lowest-rated PS5 game of 2023 so far). It's probably safe to assume that Daedalic is having a bit of trouble getting the game optimised properly for the Switch - hence the delay - so to say we're concerned about its overall quality would be a vast understatement.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

'Splatoon' and 'Wii U'.\nThe former is in reference to Foamstars — Square Enix's new turf war shooter that looks more than a little like Nintendo's squid swimmer — but the latter has come as a result of the currently-titled 'Project Q', a handheld device that lets you stream games installed on your PS5 over WiFi.

And instead of ink and squids, players cover maps in foam and ride around on surfboards.

Between the soulless platforming, undercooked stealth, tedious storytelling, and framerate stuttering so bad it’s got me killed twice, Gollum is perilously short on likeable qualities. Especially if you’re not into LOTR lore, or fine hattery.\nIn my unclad head, then, Gollum’s highlight so far has been DLSS 3. It’s one of just a few dozen games to support the newest, most artificially intelligent version of Nvidia’s deep learning-powered upscaler, and frankly makes a very compelling argument for switching it on.

          "description": "Well then. Mere minutes after Nvidia hit the launch button on the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti, AMD rocked up with a new 1080p graphics card of their own: the Radeon RX 7600. Though it’s likely more of an RTX 4060 rival, given the RX 7600 will go on sale tomorrow – May 25th – at £260 / $269, slightly less than the $299-tagged 4060.\nBased on the same RDNA 3 architecture as the Radeon RX 7900 XT and RX 7900 XTX, the RX 7600 nonetheless targets a much more widely-used monitor resolution than those 4K-minded GPU hulks. Which makes a nice change, and means AMD will beat Nvidia’s RTX 40 series to the punch on a sub-£300 GPU, with the RTX 4060 not set for release until July.\nRead more",

If you’ve played the memorably odd Mutant Year Zero or the largely forgettable Corruption 2029, you’ll know it by now – a blend of real-time stealth and turn-based tactics, where you quietly pick off stragglers from enemy squads before confronting the rest in a team scrap. Now here’s Miasma Chronicles, the Ladies’ third effort, and let’s just say they’re clearly happy to stick with what they know.\nWhile the patterns of play are to a great extent the same, though, Miasma Chronicles is a more ambitious project. Addressing criticisms that those earlier games weren’t substantial enough, it’s a broader, denser beast, in which you could easily spend twice as long – 30 hours or so – seeing all the sights and shooting the nasties that populate them. That means there’s a lot more space available for this game to coax out varied strategies and introduce more elements, which is great. But it also means the weaker elements of the formula are left more exposed, which isn’t.\nRead more",

Cast as a Space Marine, one of 40k’s genetically engineered fascist super soldiers, it’s your job to secure the Plot Device and prevent 40k’s already crappy Imperium from getting even crappier.

I trust that Phoenix Wright or Paranormasight are brilliant, but the sudden act of having to read lots in a game has never worked out for me.\nThen Citizen Sleeper came along for this month's RPS Game Club - and I think I'm a changed man? I think I now get why people are excited about static images and dialogue boxes. And I'm certain it's the game's cyclic nature that's managed to lasso my brain and keep it focused on the task at hand: help an AI trapped in a vending machine.\nRead more",

          "description": "After giving us an early glimpse of its unstoppable raptor hordes in a closed beta test last summer, Capcom recently let us loose with the opening hours of their upcoming dinosaur multiplayer shooter, Exoprimal. Its final release isn't far away now - its July 14th launch fast becoming the sole highlight of an otherwise desolate month - and I was excited to finally play the game that RPS vid bud Liam literally hasn't been able to stop talking about ever since he first clapped eyes (and his thumbs) on its somersaulting T-Rexes. (You should also read his excellent interview with the devs while you're at it, too). \nI'll hold my hands up now and say I didn't get to play as much of Exoprimal as I would have liked, but the handful of missions I did play really are as daft and brilliant as Liam described last year. I won't waste time repeating its fundamentals (you can read them here), but the basic setup is thus: in a world plagued by dinosaurs that periodically pour out of strange portals for some reason, you play a rookie dino hunter that gets pulled into a time-looping wargame set up by your company's clearly psychotic AI called Leviathan. In order to gather valuable 'combat data' for its simulations to fight said dinosaur threat, Leviathan endlessly ropes you and other rookie exosuit wearers into deadly feats of speed and skill. It's a neat, if patently preposterous setup for its 5v5 PvP multiplayer missions, but the thing that struck me most wasn't its gloriously silly dinosaurs or Leviathan's perfectly pitched ham lines. It was its bot companions, because heck, they're great to play with, but absolute fiends if you're on the wrong side of them.\nRead more",

          "description": "It's no secret that Sony have been making increasing efforts to bring their exclusive PlayStation games to PC over the last couple of years, but one thing they've never quite been clear about is when we can expect to see them. They said a few years ago that we obviously shouldn't expect a simultaneous launch release, but some such as Death Stranding and The Last Of Us Part 1 have taken as little as six to eight months to come across, while others such as Spider-Man and Uncharted 4 have taken several years. \nAccording to PlayStation boss Jim Ryan, though, data from fans seem to suggest that the only \"acceptable\" route from a player point of view is a wait of two to three years. Outrageous, I say, but also: surely that means the long-sought-after Bloodborne must be next in line, right? Surely. It's been eight years, come on now. \nRead more",

          "description": "Final Fantasy 16 producer Naoki Yoshida has said he thinks \"Maybe it's time we removed the numbers\" from Final Fantasy games. In an interview with GQ, he talked about the baggage that inevitably comes with having a 35-year-old series with soon to be 16 numbered mainline games in it (not including the sequels and spin-offs, I might add), and the confusion it continues to create with new players. \"Every numbered title we release in the series, we have to go into it like, 'It's OK, you don't have to play the rest of them,'\" he said, and removing them is \"something that I've discussed with the higher-ups\". It's an understandable problem, for sure, although I think I'd be quite sad to see the numerals go entirely. As long as they don't pull a Mortal Kombat and go back to 1, though, we're good. \nRead more",

In the nine months since I took command of a T-Rex and did a sick backflip, my life has not known peace. “I’m really excited to play Exoprimal” I’ll say to colleagues, unprompted, in important meetings unrelated to anything prehistoric in nature. “From what I've played, it blends PvE and PvP gameplay into a single multiplayer mode that feels very unique and hugely entertaining”. My tax return was voided because I drew a big stegosaurus on it. I have renamed the cat “Sniper Neosaur”, and I am disappointed that she has yet to emerge from a gooey purple orb.\r\n\n\r\nIt was my delight, then, to be given the opportunity to sit down with key members of the game’s development team to discuss Exoprimal’s inspirations, its inevitable comparisons to Dino Crisis and how Capcom plans to use it as a template for their live-service games moving forward. Alongside a fresh opportunity to check out the game, I hopped onto a Zoom call with Exoprimal’s director Takuro Hiraoka, technical director Kazuki Abe and art director Takuro Fuse.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "For the last six years, my Skyrim wood elf has been stuck in some godforsaken cave in goodness knows what corner of Tamriel. I don't remember why they were there, or what goal they were trying to achieve. It was just 'one of those caves' that looked cool and interesting when I came across it and I thought, 'Yeah, all right, let's have a go then, shall we?' But while other Skyrim caves I'd come across could be easily polished off in an office lunch-time - as that was often how I played Skyrim back then - this one was different somehow. It was so large and twisty, so infinitely befuddling, that I seemed to be trapped down there forever. Sure, I could have probably turned back, but I'd been down there for ages, and felt like I'd come too far to simply not see it all through to the bitter end. But the end never came, and I eventually abandoned my save as a result, whisked off by the prospect of newer, more exciting games that didn't involve trying to figure out how to escape its narrow, bioluminescent hellscape.\nWorse still, this disastrous feat of orienteering has now become my overriding memory of Skyrim. For all its great sidequests and its ever-increasing number of excellent mods, all I ever think about are its damn caves. Just the thought of loading up that save file again makes me grimace, and I'm starting to dread the thought of getting stuck in another one whenever the heck The Elder Scrolls 6 comes out. But I've been playing a lot of The Legend Of Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom this past week, and cor, I'm immediately jealous of Link's Ascend ability. As part of his new slate of powers, Ascend lets him instantly woosh through almost any ceiling as long as there's a traversable bit of terrain above it. That kind of power wouldn't have been half handy for my poor old wood elf, and it's precisely what makes exploring Tears Of The Kingdom's caves so enjoyable. So if there's one thing The Elder Scrolls 6 should steal take note of, please let it be this.\nRead more",

This Slavic shooter revels in the strange, straddling the line between hyper-bleak Soviet satire and goofy memetic joke factory. This isn't the best thing about HROT, we'll get to that in a couple of paragraphs. But the balancing of these two personality strands is what defines HROT's quality. At the outset, they exist in perfect symbiosis, but the relationship becomes less stable as the game goes on.\nThe year is 1986, and something is seriously wrong in the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. What that might be isn't explicitly stated, but given the year, the ambient chatter of Geiger counters, and the soldiers vomiting through their gasmasks as they prowl the abandoned streets, a nuclear disaster at an infamous Ukrainian power plant isn't a vast stretch of the imagination. In any case, anyone who wasn't killed by the fallout is now being hunted by an army of (presumably Russian, but again, it isn't explicated) soldiers. Emerging from a bomb shelter beneath Prague's Kosmonautů Metro Station (now named Háje), you take it upon yourself to defend your glorious homeland from these invaders.\nRead more",

Three logs make a raft. A plank and four wheels make a car. Two stones and a log make a... Ahem. You get the idea. In addition to this are “Zonai Devices”, components that give life and movement to your doohickeys. A fan pushes your raft across the lake. A steering stick lets you manoeuvre your little car.

Today this drive has dropped to £74.98 on Amazon UK, a historic low price that makes it easy to justify an SSD upgrade for your PC or PS5. \nRead more",

Songs Of Syx will compare to probably every colony sim you've played, in fact, but it feels like a fundamentally different game conceptually.\nThe usual parts are there. Chop some trees, chip some stones, and chep some crops to get your pioneers' basic needs met, then get to expanding. But Syx isn't interested in testing you or manufacturing drama. It's not about surviving, not about building a happy little colony. It's about how growth changes not just the scale, but the nature of a settlement. Despite similarities with its influences, it defines itself with a different dynamic, a whole different ethos to its peers. And it's one that even playing it my own awkward way hasn't broken.\nRead more",

I think it's because the game is an open world kart racer, a combination of words that sing to my nostalgic love for old-school racers, where as a kid I'd worshipped the majesty of Muppets Race Mania and Mario Kart (this is the only time I mention Mario Kart). In all respects, 2K Drive nails Lego's historically strong presentation, with slick courses and a genuinely lovely combo of grassy hills and dusty plains which certainly seem like a chip off Forza Horizon's shiny paint job. Building is upheld too, as a mighty garage lets anyone create an interesting set of wheels. The wheels start spinning, though, as the live service gates start closing. I don't think the gates totally shut off what's meant to be a fun time, but it certainly tries. Even an innocent kart racer can't escape the perils of live service, it seems.\nRead more",

Amid the last-second delay of Pokemon Home, and problems with recent raid events, another bug popped up that dealt with private tournaments. Well, the latter just got fixed, at least! This info comes from the official Japanese Pokemon account, which tweeted out the update details this week:\n\"Updated data (Ver.1.3.1) for 'Pokemon Scarlet Violet' has been distributed. Fixed an issue where unintended behavior occurred in private official tournaments where specific users were invited. We have sent an email to all contestants who were affected.\"\n\nWhen will the big bug and performance patch come for Scarlet & Violet\nAs you can glean from the super small patch notes, this is a minor update that brings the game out of the 1.3.0 era and into 1.3.1. We're still waiting for that big performance patch, but let's face it: it may never come, or it might not be sufficient enough to warrant its existence.\nIn the world of Pokemon, you never quite know what you're going to get with any given release. It's the curse of Game Freak (combined with short production schedules), and it's impacted them ever since bringing the series off of pure handhelds and into the console era of Pokemon.\nThe post A small Pokémon Scarlet & Violet patch fixed a tournament bug appeared first on Destructoid.",

In that 12-month span, players got their hands on some absolute classics of the medium. Games like Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne, Tony Hawk’s Underground, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, Beyond Good & Evil, Warcraft III, and Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, to name a few. Several franchises that are still going strong today got their start that year. Franchises like Disgaea. Arguably the first title people think of when they think of Nippon Ichi Software, Inc., Disgaea: Hour of Darkness landed on the PlayStation 2 in Japan in January 2003 and in North America that August.

Both first and third-party games were shown off, some set for the near future, and others still a ways off.\nIt was an interesting showcase, all things considered. The third-party developers were pretty varied and interesting; seeing labels like Finji up alongside the likes of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is a treat, and there were a few surprises, like the next project from the Gris team.\nStill, some of the heavy hitters were known quantities, like Street Fighter 6 or Final Fantasy XVI, or reveals that seem fairly far-off, like Bungie's revival of Marathon. Even though the Spidey gameplay reveal was admittedly rad, it was strange to not see a date at the end.\nSo that's…",

And the other time, for the reveal of something a little different: a sudsy new shooter called Foamstars.\nFoamstars is a new 4v4 shooter where players fight it out using foam. It looks bright and colorful, with some energetic vibes behind it all. Here's the trailer from today's PlayStation Showcase:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD_XuyEgfOY\nAs producer Kosuke Okatani explains on the PlayStation Blog, foam is used as both a projectile and a piece of terrain. Foam seems to stick in place, creating walls that can also be used for movement.\nSplatoon comparisons seem easy enough to make. But where Splatoon paints the level, the foam of  Foamstars seems to build up and form new terrain all its own. The same kind of territory control-focused party shooter, but with a different angle on it.\nDon't pop the bubble\nNot many more details were shared today, other than Foamstars is currently planned for both PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5. More information is expected sometime in the future, and no release date was confirmed today.\nI'm curious to see what Square Enix will do, even if I tend to have a bit of skepticism and concern when it comes to any new game that looks like a live-service project these days. It's rough out there for a new shooter, but at least Foamstars looks a bit different compared to the more bullets-and-explosions blasters you might see elsewhere.\nWe'll see how the Foamstars rise or fall as Square Enix shares more info about the new game.\nThe post Foamstars is Square Enix’s bubbly new party shooter appeared first on Destructoid.",

Sony and Insomniac premiered gameplay of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 today, showing off how the duo are working together to tackle the threat of Kraven, and other dangers lurking just below the surface.\nToday's extended spotlight, shown during the PlayStation Showcase, confirms a lot about the Spidey sequel. While Kraven the Hunter looks to be the instigating antagonist of the story, we also see mentions of Prowler, Tombstone, the Lizard, and more. And, as previously confirmed, the Symbiote—though no Venom in this spotlight.\nWe also get to see both Spider-Men in action today, as Insomniac shows a scene where the player swaps from Peter to Miles. While Peter's packing some new Symbiote-driven powers that look absolutely brutal for combat, Miles has a bunch of new utility options. A wingsuit (dubbed Web Wings), a powerful web slingshot, and lines of web for stealth sections all look fantastic. It looks like both Spideys have the suit upgrades, as Peter also shows a wingsuit during a high-speed pursuit across the bay.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrPZSq5YXqc\nI'm really into the Spidey-swapping in Marvel's Spider-Man 2, and surprised to see how well it works in the moment. Having both Miles and Peter take the spotlight works really well. It also amps up the tension, as Peter seems to be changing a bit thanks to the Symbiote's influence. Surely nothing bad will come of that, though.\nA web to weave\nThis was a pretty lengthy gameplay reveal, though it didn't end with a date. On the PlayStation Blog, Insomniac's Aaron Jason Espinoza says they hope to share a release date soon. But right now, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is still broadly set for fall 2023.\nHopefully that window sticks. But Insomniac certainly seems like it's got a big Spidey adventure in store for whenever Marvel's Spider-Man 2 lands.\nThe post Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 gameplay reveal shows Web Wings, Symbiote powers, and Kraven appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "We got PlayStation Earbuds too!\nNear the end of today's PlayStation Showcase, we got our first look at Sony's newest device. While it's not quite a Steam Deck competitor, it will give you a method to play your PlayStation 5 without getting out of bed.\nProject Q is a handheld system dedicated to streaming games from your PlayStation 5. So far, we only have a general overview of the device. It features an 8-inch LCD Screen, and it supports streaming a 1080p image at 60 FPS. Additionally, it matches the feature set of a DualSense Controller, complete with haptic feedback. Considering it looks like a PS5 controller with a screen in the middle, that makes sense!\nThis device does come with the stipulation that it can only play non-VR games directly installed on the PS5, but none of that should come as a surprise. Funny enough, games streamed via a PlayStation Plus Premium membership won't receive support on Project Q.\n[caption id=\"attachment_381641\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Sony[/caption]\nWith this announcement came the reveal of a new set of earbuds with the PlayStation branding. These fortunately work with more devices than your PlayStation 5. We have confirmation that the earbuds will support PC, and they can connect to smartphones via Bluetooth. The presentation promised that these will bring \"lossless audio with low latency,\" so we'll have to see how each product performs after they make their respective debuts.\nNeither device received as much as a release window, aside from the hint to \"look out for more details soon.\" Given what we know so far, the success of Project Q and the earbuds will largely hinge on whether their prices match their performance.

This splash screen promised that we can \"sneak back into the original games on PlayStation 5\" this autumn.\nSo far, we know that the Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Vol 1 will contain the following games:\nMetal Gear Solid\nMetal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty\nMetal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater\nThe second and third titles will be based off the HD Collection versions of each game. Otherwise, we await more details about any extra features this compilation may bring.\nA new promotional website for Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Vol 1 promises the compilation will \"allow fans to play the games as they were, as first released on the latest platforms.\" However, we have yet to receive official word on which platforms this collection will appear on. We'll keep you posted as we learn more.\nKonami has pumped out retro compilations of its glory day games at a consistent pace. In other words, it's reasonable to believe that Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Vol 1 will follow a similar trend. Even more intriguing is the \"Vol 1\" part of the title, implying that a second collection will eventually appear. We'll have to see how these games look on modern hardware later this year.\nThe post Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Vol 1 brings the first three games to PS5 appeared first on Destructoid.",

It is a \"Spirtual Rebirth\" of the Rainblood games, which were previously never released outside of China.\nhttps://youtu.be/pueXBkFMK7Q\nBuilt in Unreal Engine 5, Phantom Blade Zero follows a seemingly doomed protagonist. The game is set in a place called the \"Phantom World,\" and said protagonist is an assassin named Soul. It’s described as an action-RPG and is a mix of Chinese Martial arts and Steampunk. The trailer demonstrates a number of facets of gameplay, including setpiece moments and combat.\nThe world is described as semi-open, with the S-Game Studio Founder saying, \"Phantom Blade Zero unfolds in a semi-open world, consisting of multiple large maps filled with diverse, handcrafted activities.\" He also goes onto describe the style as \"Bleak and punishing.\" That may sound like Dark Souls, but the combat depicted in the trailer looks nothing like that. The enemy design definitely has some things in common with Sekiro, at least.\nNo release date is stated, but it’s currently announced for PC and PS5.\nThe post Martial Arts RPG Phantom Blade Zero announced for PS5 and PC appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "A brand new Journey\nDuring today's PlayStation Showcase, we saw a glimpse of the newest game from Giant Squid, the creators of ABZÛ and The Pathless.\nSword of the Sea showed off a lot of sand surfing, immediately evoking memories of 2012's Journey from thatgamecompany. In fact, the trailer reminds us that this game comes from the \"visionary artist\" that brought us Journey. In other words, the developers aren't shy on this connection to the decade-old classic PlayStation 3 title.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXUmt8SPfJk\nIn a supplemental post on the PlayStation Blog, Giant Squid founder Matt Nava provides a few key details about this upcoming title. As seen in the footage provided, Sword of the Sea controls movement via what it calls a hoversword. This cutely named device promises to control like \"a snowboard, skateboard, and hoverboard all in one,\" according to Nava.\nControlling like Tony Hawk everywhere sounds intriguing, though it's the \"sword\" part of the \"hoversword\" that intrigues me. I'm not anticipating combat necessarily, but if there's a blade in a game, I assume we'll need to slice something.\nThe post also provides a few key story details to give context to the trailer. We control a character called Wraith, tasked with restoring life to submerged ruins known as the Necropolis of the Gods. We'll bring back \"giant shoals of fish and creatures,\" though we'll also encounter leviathans that won't take kindly to our presence. We'll have to learn more about this world after the game launches.\nHonestly, the promise of an \"emotional core\" and a plot about returning life to the world reminds me of Terranigma. In other words, I'm already all in for this one. No release window has been revealed so far, so we may need to wait until we can ride on hoverswords ourselves.\nThe post Giant Squid announces Sword of the Sea for PlayStation 5 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Arrowhead Game Studios has announced that Helldivers 2 will drop onto new planets, with a new perspective, in 2023.\nRevealed during today's PlayStation Showcase, Helldivers 2 still looks to feature much of the Starship Troopers-esque gunning and bug fighting. This time, though, the action is swapping to an over-the-shoulder shooter, rather than the original's top-down perspective.\n[caption id=\"attachment_381595\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Arrowhead/PlayStation[/caption]\nIn a post on the PlayStation Blog, Arrowhead's Katherine Baskin confirms many of the same gameplay features will return: customizable loadouts, stratagems, and of course, friendly fire.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE7KTE28HrA\nCo-op is also still a focus, as teams will have to strategize and complete objectives together. So even though it looks like the camera's headed in a new direction, the goal is still the same team-driven, bug-blasting action.\n\"Brace yourselves for adrenaline-fueled moments, intense action, and a bond that forms when you rely on your team to complete missions or comically fail due to the reckless handling of over-the-top firepower,\" said Arrowhead Game Studios CEO and game director Johan Pilestedt. \"Most importantly, we hope that the laughter we share in the studio while playing the game will resonate with you as you enjoy this crazy universe.\"\nWhile the change is perspective might be odd, I put a lot of hours into the original Helldivers. If they can maintain the same quality of co-op into this new approach, I could be talked into some more hell dives.

Kicking off in about 30 minutes from now, PlayStation fans can expect news and updates on a jackload of releases, currently in development for PS4, PS5, and/or PSVR 2 platforms.\nWhile we don't quite know exactly what will be shown on this afternoon's stream, it seems very likely that Insomniac will have some new footage, (and probably a launch date), for Marvel's Spider-Man 2, which is one of the few PlayStation exclusives still planned for 2023. It's likely that Square Enix will also drop in for some Final Fantasy XVI updates, ahead of the RPGs late-June launch.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4EKydVVvHk\nIn regards to third-party titles, it's getting a little late for Street Fighter 6 updates, but perhaps we'll see another trailer or gameplay footage for NetherRealm Studios' recently announced Mortal Kombat 1. There are also some Hail Mary possibilities, such as Kojima Productions' Death Stranding 2, and an update on Marvel's Wolverine — But one would obviously expect Insomniac to focus on its current Marvel Comics game before it starts talking about the next one.\nWhatever The Blue Brand has to show us, we hope that you'll grab a drink and settle in with us. Feel free to leap into the comments with your thoughts, reactions, and opinions to the news as it rolls out in front of us. Given another time-out from E3, these streams remain the best way for us to enjoy the summer of gaming (as opposed to The Summer of Gaming) together.

The suit, filed by a guardian on behalf of their minor, is looking to force Nintendo to refund all loot box purchases made by minors since the free-to-play title's release in September 2019.\nAs reported by Class Action.org, the lawsuit essentially alleges the common concerns about the free-to-play/loot box system, that grinds are implemented in order to encourage players to spend real money on items in order to get ahead of the game, save time, or simply have additional content to play with. The lawsuit alleges \"dark patterns\" are utilized by Nintendo to steer players toward the frequent purchase of \"Spotlight Pipes\" — essentially Mario Kart Tour's loot boxes.\n\"Minors are especially susceptible to these addiction-enhancing elements of game design,\" reads the lawsuit. \"The experience of acquiring surprise rewards and the associated excitement of uncovering unexpected in-game items holds a strong appeal for minors and reinforces their desire to keep playing and keep getting rewards.\"\nIt should be noted that Spotlight Pipes were removed from Mario Kart Tour in the fall of 2022.\nMario Kart Tour raised eyebrows at launch with the reveal of its monetization system, which featured particularly egregious pricing and super-low draw rates. The title itself has quietly continued to exist in the background, offering up new courses, racers, and other updates on a seasonal basis.

Developer Pieces Interactive notes that it wishes to capture the creepy, third-person gameplay and cosmic horror nature of the original release, brought up-to-date with modern technology and mechanics. The studio considers the reboot a true \"love letter\" to its predecessor.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI7wA60-sQw\nAlone in the Dark has sort of stumbled through its own lifetime, with three groundbreaking but clumsy initial releases, an \"ok\" PlayStation comeback in 2001, and the notorious 2008 disaster that reviewed so poorly, it lead then-publisher Atari to threaten legal action against press outlets. With these strange and middling titles behind it, perhaps this aged franchise, essentially a forerunner to survival horror itself, can retake its place at the table. I have a fondness for AitD, and I hope that the new game is a real success, conceptually and financially.\nThe Alone in the Dark showcase will hit THQ Nordic's YouTube and Twitch channels tomorrow, May 25, at 17:00 PT / 20:00pm ET / 01:00 BST.

          "description": "Over 600,000 people falling into their TVs worldwide\nSony has released its latest financial earnings report, which shows that its newest Virtual Reality technology, PlayStation VR2 had a pretty impressive launch, garnering over 600,000 unit sales in its first six weeks of release.\nWhile VR tech has been, and perhaps always will be, something of a niche market, this number eclipses the launch numbers of the original PlayStation VR hardware, which first launched back in the fall of 2016. Even more notably, the PSVR 2 unit has been lambasted for its staggeringly high price range, with the PS5-only unit retailing for around $550 USD, essentially the price of a disc-based PS5 itself.\n\nBut these numbers show that PSVR 2 has still seen a successful 8% increase over its predecessor, in part thanks to a litany of recognizable brands among its first run of software. VR games and experiences — either on the shelves now, or coming in the near future — include titles based on series such as Horizon, Resident Evil, Ghostbusters, Until Dawn, Tetris, and Gran Turismo. While undoubtedly expensive, PlayStation VR2 is highly impressive technology, with almost bewildering levels of immersion and a much slicker and more efficient cabling system.\nInterestingly, however, the report fails to declare how many PSVR 2 units have been sold in total since the hardware's release. Sony is quick to note the success for those six launch weeks, but remain quiet on sales for several months since. Initial reports from Bloomberg said that Sony had hoped to shift two million units in PSVR 2 launch year, but halved those expectations due to disappointing pre-orders. This is a report Sony was quick to deny. But it remains to be seen whether these impressive launch figures represent the lion's share of all PSVR 2 sales, for this year and those years still to come.\nThe post Despite high price, PlayStation VR2 still beat predecessor’s launch sales appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The developer is undergoing a restructuring\nSega Europe and Relic Entertainment have announced the layoff of 121 employees from Relic.\nThe press release cites “external factors” and goes on to say that this is part of a restructuring of a wider restructuring of the studio.\nhttps://twitter.com/relicgames/status/1661060864651452416?s=20\nRelic Entertainment is based in Canada and has been behind such hits as Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War and Homeworld. Their area of expertise is strategy games, with their most recent title being Company of Heroes 3. While Company of Heroes 3 did well critically, user reception is much worse, with the addition of microtransactions often cited for the negative response. Nonetheless, if missing targets was the reason for the job cuts, Sega hasn’t disclosed anything.\n“Relic and SEGA remain fully committed to supporting and investing in our titles, including the recently released Company of Heroes 3. We’re confident that following this necessary restructuring, Relic will be in a position of strength to continue delivering outstanding experiences to players all over the world,” the press release says.\nIt goes onto say that “Right now our focus is on supporting departing employees in every way we can.” Again, nothing more specific is mentioned.\nLayoffs always suck, especially ones of this magnitude. It’s something we, unfortunately, see a lot of in this industry. Hopefully, those affected can quickly find a new home and continue doing what they love. I also hope Relic’s “restructuring” goes well, and we can continue to see more from the studio.\nThe post Sega and Relic lay off 121 employees at Company of Heroes studio appeared first on Destructoid.",

And if its combat reminds you of DMC, it’s probably because the combat director of FFXVI is Ryota Suzuki, who helped design combat on Devil May Cry 4 and Devil May Cry 5. But he also worked on Marvel Vs. Capcom 2. \nWhile the DMC inspirations laced within FFXVI’s combat are hard to miss, Suzuki told me that Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 inspired some of FFXVI's systems as well. \n“There’s actually something from Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 that we took and put into Final Fantasy XVI, and that is, as you may or may not know, in Marvel Vs. Capcom 2, we had the Assist system where you could give orders to your partner in battle,” Suzuki says. “And by impl…",

          "description": "Atari and developer Sneakybox have announced Days of Doom, an apocalyptic turn-based tactical roguelite. The game hopes to subvert the expectations of those who are tired of the brown and gray color palettes of other apocalypse settings by placing the action over vibrant and colorful backdrops as you battle through hordes of zombies, raiders, and mutant lizards. \nNavigating the wasteland to reach a sanctuary will require strategy, as you must combat the encroaching mutated forces using your group of distinct survivors. Beyond the turn-based tactics at play, you must also manage your scarce collection of resources and keep your wits about you as you maneuver through the hordes of the undead.\n\nEach of the eight survivor classes features unique abilities that can be used to shift your fortunes in battle. For example, the Pyro class allows you to burn enemies and leave them with residual damage each turn while combining the Hydromancer with the Thrasher can drench enemies with water before electrocuting them for a devastating synergy. Players will need to use these abilities to their advantage and think strategically with these abilities to overcome the seemingly insurmountable odds.\nAnd, of course, with it being a roguelite game, players can expect each run to feel unique. More than 50 randomly occurring events present risk-reward scenarios for players during their runs, while more than 70 collectible items and runes can help you turn the odds in your favor in your given run. However, as you play several runs and make progress, you unlock permanent upgrades, such as party size increases and resource accumulation speed.\nIf you'd like to learn more, you can check out the reveal trailer below.\n\n\nDays of Doom arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, PC, and Atari VCS later this year.",

Battlefields are covered in soapy foam, which players can use to their advantage by creating slippery surfaces to slide at high speeds. Foam can also be used in other ways, such as to shield yourself and your teammates from attacks or create vantage points.

Originally released in 2004, the title is a 1960s-era prequel to the Metal Gear series that tells the origin story of Big Boss and lays the groundwork for the entire Metal Gear fiction. \n\n\nUnfortunately, we don't get to see gameplay, and the title doesn’t have a release window, but the first three Metal Gear Solid games are also being bundled in a collection heading to PlayStation 5 this fall. What do you think of this first look at Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater? Let us know in the comments!",

          "description": "Alan Wake 2 had an appearance today during the PlayStation Showcase event. And as you might've guessed, the trailer left a lot of questions. But it did answer an all-important one: when the game is coming out. \n\n\nHere's what we gathered: Alan is trapped ... somewhere. According to him, he has to write to escape. Ostensibly, that's from the cult members chasing and attacking seemingly everyone within a 50-mile radius. Alan is writing about the police investigation into the death of Robert Nightingale, one of the antagonists of the first game. Here, the trailer splits into multiple perspectives: that of Alan and that of two investigators (one of which is voiced by James McCaffrey, of Max Payne fame, which Remedy also developed). Notably, we see that we'll play at least two different characters in Alan Wake 2: Alan, of course, but then also one of the investigators, a young woman named Saga Anderson. \nThe trailer closes with the game's release date: October 17, 2023. \nAlan Wake 2 was originally announced back at The Game Awards 2021 via a cinematic trailer. This is the first time we've seen the game in action.",

That’s not coincidence, since Giant Squid’s founder is Matt Nava, who was previously art director at thatgamecompany. But while this new game is destined to draw strong comparisons to that classic title, there were some notable differences on display. First, the desert itself looks much more like a flowing sea, and the character you control like a surfer moving through the water. In certain sequences, the desert seems to actually transform into water, suggesting a mystery at the core of the game.\nIn the footage shown, we see a focus on flow movement for the protagonist as they ride across the sand and trick off of half-pipes. From surrounding descriptions about the game, we know that you control a character named the Wraith, who was brought back to life to restore life to a ruined world, while facing off against vast leviathans that attempt to block progress.\nSword of the Sea is coming to PS5, but no word yet on a release date.",

While seeing Venom emerge from the shadows was extremely exciting, the bulk of the trailer showcased Peter Parker and Miles Morales working side by side to take down several goons in the streets of New York.\nThat in itself was merely an eyebrow-raising affair, but it's hardly confirmation of cooperative play. However, when Miles Morales voice actor Nadji Jeter responded to a SacAnime panel question about whether or not Spider-Man 2 is a co-op game or not with, \"I don't know if it's been announced or not, but I think so,\" that added fuel to the fire. \nYesterday, when a Twitter user asked if the speculation and rumors were true, Insomniac Games unexpectedly jumped in to clear the air. \"Nope! It is an epic single-player adventure!,\" the tweet from the official Insomniac Games account said. This seems to fully debunk the speculation from fans and comments from Jeter, and that Marvel's Spider-Man 2 will follow in the footsteps of Marvel's Spider-Man and Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales in being a fully single-player experience.\nNope! It is an epic single-player adventure!\nMay 22, 2023\nThis isn't the first time a Spider-Man 2 voice actor has seemingly confirmed details about the game without the permission of the studio or PR team. Back in March, Venom voice actor Tony Todd announced to the world through his Twitter account that Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is expected to launch in September of this year, with commercials starting to appear in August. While we are still waiting to see if that pans out better than Jeter's comments about co-op, Todd has since deleted the original tweet. \nWith a PlayStation Showcase set to air tomorrow, we might not have long to wait to learn more. For now, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is set to arrive on PlayStation 5 later this year.\n[via IGN]",

Some potential players have assumed when that window is up, a PC version of FFXVI will be released. \nDuring my FFXVI cover story trip to Square Enix’s Tokyo, Japan, office, I asked producer Naoki Yoshida about a PC version of the game. While it sounds like it’s on the way, he stresses that it will be longer than six months before players see or even possibly hear about it. I’m guessing he mentions six months because of the aforementioned exclusivity window, but he reiterates that this window expiring does not mean the PC version of FFXVI will go live then or anytime soon. \nSo for now, and presumably quite a while after the game’s release, if you want to play FFXVI, you’ll need a PlayStation 5. \nFor more, be sure to check out Game Informer’s exclusive FFXVI coverage hub by clicking the banner below.",

          "description": "With Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse set to arrive in theaters in just over a week, it should come as no surprise that Fortnite is adding some items and costumes to the most expansive IP crossover in gaming history. As teased yesterday, Miles Morales and Miguel O'Hara (AKA Spider-Man 2099) are joining Fortnite in promotion of the highly anticipated film.\nThe new additions, which include reskinned Spider-Man's Web-Shooters – now called Spider-Verse Web-Shooters – and two new Outfits, accompany Spider-Man themed Week 11 Quests. Epic Games teases that the Web-Shooters, in particular, will come in handy in those Quests. While most of those Quests award XP, one will give you the \"Silk & Cologne (EI8HT version)\" lobby track from Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.\nIf this sounds up your alley, you can find the Spider-Verse Web-Shooters on the ground or by exchanging bars for them from Spider-Gwen. You can also find the Spider-Man (Miles Morales) Outfit, which includes the masked Earth 1610 alt style and the Spider-Verse Portal Back Bling, as well as the Spider-Man 2099 Outfit, which includes the 2099 Web Cape Back Bling, in the Item Shop. These items, along with other accessories, can be purchased as part of the Across the Spider-Verse Bundle. That bundle includes the Mega City Swing Loading Screen.\nSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse arrives in theaters on June 2.",

The rhythm game, which tasks players with shaking maracas to the beat of popular songs, finally has a concrete release date. Players can expect to transform their Joy-Cons into maracas when the Switch-exclusive title launches on August 29. \nSamba de Amigo: Party Central's launch soundtrack already features 40 popular tracks from artists like Ariana Grande, Kesha, Nicki Minaj, and Carly Rae Jepsen, as well as some tracks from Sonic Adventure 2 and Sonic Forces.

The studio is headed up by Sean Crooks, a former Ubisoft producer with credits ranging from Just Dance and Driver to the Watch Dogs franchise. Other members of the team include developers who have worked on series like Splinter Cell, Army of Two, Far Cry, and Child of Light.\nThe team hopes its first project will kickstart a new franchise. The title is an open-world, story-driven action/adventure title that draws inspiration from '80s action and horror films. Bad Brain is using Unreal Engine 5 to develop its debut title, which will launch across multiple platforms.\n\"I'm honored to be leading this talented team of developers in Canada,\" Crooks said in a press release. \"We're all passionate about creating memorable and meaningful experiences. NetEase Games has given us a warm welcome, with an abundance of support and creative freedom to allow us to do what we do best. Our first game is a passion project that gives us the opportunity to truly free our brains.\"\nNetEase, which is based in China, views this as an investment in the Canadian game-development industry. \"We're thrilled to welcome Bad Brain Game Studios into our family and enriching our presence in Canada,\" NetEase Games president of global investments and partnerships Simon Zhu said in that same release. \"With this new studio, NetEase Games continues its commitment to nurturing top-tier talent in Canada and creating games that players love. Canada has a thriving gaming industry, and we're excited to continue to be a part of it. We believe that our talented teams in Toronto, Montreal, and beyond will create some of the most innovative and exciting games the industry has seen.\"\nBad Brain Game Studios will have offices in Toronto, Ontario, and Montreal, Quebec, and will operate using a hybrid work model.

          "description": "Since the PlayStation 3 generation, updates released on a game’s launch day, colloquially known as Day One patches or updates, have been the norm. Sometimes they’re small, squashing a few last-minute bugs, but other times, they’re massive and nigh essential to enjoying the adventure before you. \nHowever, Day One patches draw criticism from players excited to jump into the action, only to be left watching a download bar fill up. Some players with slower internet or limited access might be left waiting for hours, if not days, depending on download speeds. During my Final Fantasy XVI cover story trip, I asked the team about its March accomplishment of going gold and what the team was working on now. \nFinal Fantasy XVI has gone gold.\n#FF16's launch on June 22nd 🐺 pic.twitter.com/Vrtd3cMNW5\nMarch 31, 2023\nTo my surprise, developer Creative Business Unit III isn’t working on a day one patch, a revelation that continues to become rarer with each new release in games. Director Hiroshi Takai gave me a few reasons as to why. \nThe first is that the team is confident in its final build of Final Fantasy XVI. The second is that he and producer Naoki Yoshida (and the rest of the CBUIII team) believe the game should be ready to go at launch, recognizing that not everyone has access to the internet needed to download a day one patch in light of Final Fantasy XVI’s global simultaneous release. So as of right now, we won’t be downloading a big patch on June 22 when the game hits PlayStation 5. \nHowever, Takai notes that CBUIII is testing the game daily and searching for bugs, and things could change as a result, but right now, like in the days of old Final Fantasy, this entry should work entirely as expected out of the box.\nFor more, be sure to check out Game Informer’s exclusive FFXVI coverage hub by clicking the banner below.",

Be it State of Plays, PlayStation Showcases, or even PlayStation Blogs, it’s clear Final Fantasy XVI is a big release for Sony. \nDuring my cover story trip to Square Enix’s Tokyo, Japan, offices, I asked producer Naoki Yoshida how developer Creative Business Unit III feels about the game’s PS5 exclusivity and what that does for the studio in terms of development. He says it’s important to distinguish that CBUIII doesn’t go into game development thinking it wants to limit a game to just one platform or company.

First released throughout the early 2000s, these games are enhanced portable remakes of Super Mario Bros. 2, Super Mario World, and Super Mario World 2: Yoshi’s Island, respectively. \n\n\nAlthough the original versions of each game are already available in the NES/SNES libraries, the Advance series features several tweaks, such as Advance 2 giving Luigi his Super Mario Bros. 2 jump. These join Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3, which was in the initial batch of GBA titles, to complete the series. As a reminder, the GBA library is part of the Expansion Pack tier, the pricier upgraded version of Nintendo Switch Online. \nYou can keep up with every game on Nintendo Switch Online by visiting our complete library database.",

          "description": "The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has been out for about a week, but yesterday marked the launch of its first post-release patch. Version 1.1.1 of the game fixes one very specific problem, but also ambiguously addresses issues to improve the gameplay experience. You find the patch notes below, as well as on Nintendo's website.\nFixed issue where, sometimes, the player could not clear main quest “The Closed Door,” even if they fulfilled the conditions to advance the quest.\n\t\nIf you have already encountered this issue, you will be able to clear the quest by downloading this update data.\nSeveral issues have been addressed to improve the gameplay experience.\nDespite both Tears of the Kingdom and Breath of the Wild being incredibly solid games out of the gate, even Zelda is not immune to patches, but Nintendo tends to keep the changes vague. Many of Breath of the Wild's patch notes simply pointed to the updates making the game a more pleasant experience. It seems the trajectory of Tears of the Kingdom's patch notes might receive the same ambiguous details if the second bullet point is an indication of what's to come.\nFor more on Zelda, you can read Game Informer's Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom review, our beginner tips guide, our interview with producer and director Eiji Aonuma and Hidemaro Fujibayashi, our Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Amiibo guide, this feature of stupid screenshots, and a tip of how to find interesting sidequests.",

          "description": "The Case of the Golden Idol was one of 2022’s best hidden gems that only PC players have been able to enjoy. Fortunately, Switch owners can put on their thinking hats when the dark mystery game heads to the platform next week.\nOn May 25, The Case of the Golden Idol lands on Switch alongside its recently released expansion, The Spider of Lanka. Both titles can be purchased separately or together in a bundle. The award-winning game takes place in the 18th century and tasks you with solving a mystery spanning decades over 11 bizarre, interconnected deaths. Each scenario is presented as static scenes where players must carefully observe the environment to find clues revealing who each character is, how the person died, and the chronological order of events. The Spider of Lanka serves as a prequel that adds three additional cases. \nThe Switch version sports a redesigned UI to better accommodate a controller-based experience. If this is the first you've heard of the game, the trailer below provides a good idea of what to expect.\n\n\nAs a fan of The Case of the Golden Idol, it's great to see it come to more platforms, and Switch should be an especially good fit. Will you be giving the game a shot on Switch? Let us know in the comments!",

Thankfully, a lengthy trailer gives us the good fortune of enjoying some action-packed gameplay footage. \nThis reimagining/reboot of its 2014 predecessor is coming on Friday, October 13. A big new trailer set to Iron Maiden packs in a ton of metal-infused action that shows off the game's Unreal Engine 5-rendered graphics. \n\n\nIt's been a long road for Lords of the Fallen, which began life as Lords of the Fallen 2 years ago before development restarted from scratch. It was re-announced as The Lords of the Fallen last year before reverting back to its original name. The Souls-inspired game's open world is five times larger than the original's and supports online co-op. The combat has also been retuned to be faster and more fluid, and developer Hexworks promises the game to be an overall expansive action RPG experience. \nWe're looking forward to seeing the result of this overhaul when the game comes to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

Although 2011’s MK 9 already did that, the wild ending of MK 11 (and its Aftermath expansion) certainly paved the runway for Netherrealm to essentially start fresh and do whatever it wants with the fiction going forward. As such, this 12th entry has the potential to be pretty nuts, even by MK standards. \nWe learned a new Mortal Kombat was coming this year when Warner Bros. CEO told investors that Mortal Kombat 12 was launching this year. Whether this new game is actually called MK 12 or something else entirely is unclear, but we’re looking forward to waking up bright and early tomorrow morning to see what’s next for our favorite spine-ripping kombatants.",
