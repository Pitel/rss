          "description": "Positively shocking.\nConfusion abounds with this one. This isn’t the same Shockman that was originally released for the TurboGrafx-16 back in 1991, which was a localisation of Japan's Shubibinman 2. This, Cyber Citizen Shockman, is a new 2023 translation of the original Shubibinman game from 1989; and frankly, that’s the most special thing about it.\nHere a map overworld offers a choice of multiple paths, each leading to a very brief platforming stage scattered with enemies and pitfalls to leap over and avoid. Each has a boss, ranging from nice-looking mecha-styled things or well-rendered monsters, requiring little except rapid spamming early-on, and more concerted strategy later, depending on your health. Visiting the map screen offers up brief dialogue exchanges and the option to heal yourself or buy weapon upgrades with gold acquired during the stage. Deaths will slightly penalise your gold bounty, but hostages you save with each boss defeat also offer transient bonuses, health-ups, and occasionally become permanent map fixtures, like the dedicated healing nurse. Boosting weapon power is your modus operandi, eventually acquiring the chargeable Shockbeam - an addition that makes things much more enjoyable and shifts your approach to enemy negotiations.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Shohei Ohtani meets Rockman.\nThere’s something refreshing about playing a Mega Man-like action platformer in 2023. Instead of expansive open worlds to explore, you get a handful of themed stages to leap through. There’s no deep narrative or lore to invest in, yet the colourful cast of bad guys and allies draws you in all the same with their fun designs. Catchy chiptune scores get stuck in your head instead of epic orchestral arrangements. All of the above is true of Sonzai Game’s sports-themed Bat Boy; if you’ve played an action platformer before, you know what you’re in for, and that ain’t a bad thing.\nBat Boy’s opening cinematic introduces you to Ryosuke and his hero team of eight sporty friends, including his tennis-playing love interest Racket Girl and the macho (American) football player Mr. Blitzer. Inexplicably, a little gremlin man named Lord Vicious and his bodyguard lure the Super Sports Friends into a trap, brainwashing them to join in his games in another dimension. Ryosuke, wielding his trusty bat, manages to swat away the brainwashing magic before it can infect him, so it’s up to him to seek out and beat the possession out of his buddies as the titular Bat Boy, gaining his friends’ abilities along the way that will help him in his quest. Also along for the ride is Garou, a talking crow that doles out information and one-liners.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

But my affection for George Lucas' brain-baby is less about the stories and characters, and more about the general vibe of the galaxy itself. I love its retro-futurist junkpunk style, the rusty spaceships, dusty planets, and fusty aliens. That's why I've more fondness for games like Dark Forces and KotOR than any of the films or TV shows, as they let me poke around locations like Tatooine and Ord Mantell at my own pace.\r\n\n\r\nHence, the idea of being properly, immerse in Star Wars, to be physically surrounded by it and able to touch it, is probably my ultimate VR fantasy. Sod the imaginatively inert virtual spaces of Horizon Worlds, if Mark Zuckerberg really wanted to sell the Metaverse to me, he'd build the whole thing out in Mos Eisely chic, and let me run my own virtual cantina selling NFT space-drinks to legless bounty hunters and idiot Web3 prospectors.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "\"Does that pommel horse have a grenade launcher?\" is one of many bizarre questions I found myself asking while playing HROT. This Slavic shooter revels in the strange, straddling the line between hyper-bleak Soviet satire and goofy memetic joke factory. This isn't the best thing about HROT, we'll get to that in a couple of paragraphs. But the balancing of these two personality strands is what defines HROT's quality. At the outset, they exist in perfect symbiosis, but the relationship becomes less stable as the game goes on.\nThe year is 1986, and something is seriously wrong in the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. What that might be isn't explicitly stated, but given the year, the ambient chatter of Geiger counters, and the soldiers vomiting through their gasmasks as they prowl the abandoned streets, a nuclear disaster at an infamous Ukrainian power plant isn't a vast stretch of the imagination. In any case, anyone who wasn't killed by the fallout is now being hunted by an army of (presumably Russian, but again, it isn't explicated) soldiers. Emerging from a bomb shelter beneath Prague's Kosmonautů Metro Station (now named Háje), you take it upon yourself to defend your glorious homeland from these invaders.\nRead more",

I know you’ve all been waiting for your favourite PC gaming-focused website to offer their take on it so there you go. It’s properly, properly good. The best open-world adventure since Elden Ring, except arguably better because it doesn’t pull your trousers down and point out the colour of your underwear every time you dare to explore a forest or watch a sunset.\r\n\n\r\nAs you’ve probably seen, the game’s biggest new draw is “Ultrahand”, which allows Link to pick up loose objects and glue them together. Three logs make a raft. A plank and four wheels make a car. Two stones and a log make a... Ahem. You get the idea. In addition to this are “Zonai Devices”, components that give life and movement to your doohickeys. A fan pushes your raft across the lake. A steering stick lets you manoeuvre your little car. It’s a marvellous construction system that leverages the pre-existing physics engine seen in the game’s predecessor, Breath Of The Wild, to startling results. Does this all sound familiar?\r\n\n \nRead more",

Chop some trees, chip some stones, and chep some crops to get your pioneers' basic needs met, then get to expanding. But Syx isn't interested in testing you or manufacturing drama. It's not about surviving, not about building a happy little colony. It's about how growth changes not just the scale, but the nature of a settlement. Despite similarities with its influences, it defines itself with a different dynamic, a whole different ethos to its peers. And it's one that even playing it my own awkward way hasn't broken.\nRead more",

I think it's because the game is an open world kart racer, a combination of words that sing to my nostalgic love for old-school racers, where as a kid I'd worshipped the majesty of Muppets Race Mania and Mario Kart (this is the only time I mention Mario Kart). In all respects, 2K Drive nails Lego's historically strong presentation, with slick courses and a genuinely lovely combo of grassy hills and dusty plains which certainly seem like a chip off Forza Horizon's shiny paint job. Building is upheld too, as a mighty garage lets anyone create an interesting set of wheels. The wheels start spinning, though, as the live service gates start closing. I don't think the gates totally shut off what's meant to be a fun time, but it certainly tries. Even an innocent kart racer can't escape the perils of live service, it seems.\nRead more",

It's very hard to describe Veiled Experts to someone in a way that doesn't prompt an instant dismissal. That was my reaction too. I saw it on Twitch, my mind said \"third person Counter-Strike\", and sent an automatic signal down to my lips to proclaim the words: \"sounds awful\".\nThank goodness for boredom. Later that day I was at a loose end and saw that Veiled Experts was free, so I downloaded it and tried it out. And here we are, a month and a bit later. The game is about to release into Early Access, and I'm desperately trying to get everyone I know to play it with me, because it's bloody phenomenal.\nRead more",

Its smart text-based puzzle design fused with stylish dungeon crawling had me completely spellbound, to the point where it's now become one of my most anticipated indie games for 2024. It’s honestly unlike anything I’ve played.\nDeveloped by Paul Hart and Lee Williams, Cryptmaster is a dark fantasy dungeon crawler where you need to type (or speak) commands to help get your undead amnesiac party members out of a strange underground kingdom. Your band of forgetful adventurers aren't completely at the mercy of the dungeon, as a devilish-looking necromancer is there to give a helping hand. An ominous figure who acts as both guide and a quest giver, the horned necromancer helps you navigate the strange rules of this underground world where words and letters are a resource for survival.\nRead more",

Yes, it's good at what I think it sets out to do. Being an irreverent mess is a valid artistic approach, but still means your game is exactly that. It's not a good game in the traditional sense, though. Do I recommend you buy it? If you can spare £20 to pat an artist on the back, maybe. What kind of artist? Put it this way: on release, its developer changed all their Steam page credits to \"Alan Smithee\". I don’t think they’re disowning it.\nRead more",

He's not only spoken at length about how playing the original pair of Zelda games on the NES provided ample inspiration for his crafty hack and slasher, but you can also see it right there in the game itself, from your fox hero's bright green outfit to the beautifully illustrated in-game manual you piece together to unravel the world's mysteries. \nBut speaking with Shouldice at GDC this year, I wanted to talk to him another other potential source of inspiration. Before he struck out on his own to make Tunic, Shouldice cut his teeth making hidden object games, ranging from globe-trotting mystery adventures to Atlantean-themed detective stories. On paper, this earlier work would appear to provide the perfect proving ground for Tunic, as we all know by now that it holds plenty of secrets of its own. For Shouldice, though, it was more of a reaction against his earlier work that fuelled his approach to Tunic, as he gradually came to realise his hidden object games \"weren't tapping into this very specific type of mystery and discovery and player agency and true exploration that I was interested in,\" he says.\nRead more",

          "description": "It's been a harrowing few years in our real world, and I often feel like I'm just trying to keep my own little flame of hope safe from the howling winds of indifference and despair. So Darkest Dungeon 2, a party-based dark fantasy roguelite centered on the idea of doing just that, ended up being a bit too familiar and also a bit therapeutic. Having well over a hundred hours in the first game, I was also pleasantly surprised by some of the ways this carriage-bound journey into existential dread changes up the formula… and not so much by a couple of others.\nJust like its predecessor, Darkest Dungeon 2 leads with vibes and attitude. Every bit of art and atmosphere is subtly (or not-so-subtly) menacing, worn down, and melancholic, with Wayne June's unmistakeable narration laying out the compelling story of a quest for answers that went too far. The background on how the world got this way is doled out in tiny morsels of tragic exposition after the conclusion of each run, so I always had new details to look forward to whether I won or lost. It's very clear that reality is, as they would say in the Bay Area, \"hella broken,\" and that it's somehow your fault as the nameless financier of these soul-rending expeditions into the darkness. But the nature of your crimes takes a long time to reveal itself.\nRead more",

In a new trailer, Devolver Digital confirmed the Bleak Sword DX release date for June 8th on both platforms.\nOriginally released on Apple Arcade back in 2019, the enhanced version will include the original nine chapters in the Bleak Sword campaign and all three DLC chapters.  The gist is that you'll be taking down horrifying monsters across a variety of cursed battlefields with a variety of fierce weaponry and powerful magic.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArQ5jZDHCSI\nIt apparently improves the original in every way\nThe improved version of the game will include a streamlined control system built specifically for PC and Switch. Utilizing the new controls you will be able to execute new attacks, parries, and counters against an enhanced enemy AI. Graphically the game has received graphical enhancements in every aspect. There are new post-processing effects, unique filters, an adaptive depth of field, and more. Particle effects, foliage, and even the weather have seen some improvements as well.\nAdditionally, Bleak Sword DX features three all-new game modes as well. First is a brand new randomizer campaign modifier that creates a remixed version of the original game. Next is a Boss Run gauntlet where you will face all 12 in-game bosses in a row with only one health bar. Last is an endless arena mode throwing increasingly difficult enemies at you until you suffer defeat. This is all accompanied by the epic score from award-winning composer Jim Guthrie and sound designer Joonas Turner. If you are looking for a challenging but rewarding action romp in a dark fantasy setting, be sure to check out the game when it releases early next month.\nA demo for Bleak Sword DX is currently available on Steam!\nThe post Bleak Sword DX release date is soon appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Walk on over\nEpic Games has revealed the latest freebie for the EGS, and it's none other than the oddball cross-country adventure Death Stranding. Note that this is a full week of freebie availability (through May 25 at 11AM ET), which is a massive step up from the prior \"24-hour use it or lose it\" promotion that ran in December of 2022. All you need to do is follow the link here (or get it directly through the Epic Games launcher) and you're good to go.\nWhen playing through Death Stranding pre-launch in complete isolation, I had no clue how the general public would respond to it. It was such a bizarre big swing, and perfectly on-brand for Kojima. But even without the Metal Gear name attached, it did fairly well for itself; spreading to multiple platforms beyond its PS4 launch, and a sequel is fully confirmed, amid other multimedia opportunities.\nIf you haven't played it yet, give it a go! I mean it's free for a week, so even if it's ultra-low on your priority list, you'll probably get around to clicking \"forget password\" on your lapsed Epic Games account at some point...right?!\nWhat's next for Epic Games Store freebies?\nNext up is another \"mystery game\" that Epic has been hyping for some time now, due out in five days. If you haven't already, bookmark this page and periodically go back to it and redeem whatever is there.\nThe post Death Stranding is free to keep on PC this week via EGS, and it’s worth taking a punt on appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Yahoooooo?\nSo, how about those May 2023 Switch Online offerings? With Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom taking the world by storm, it would make sense if Nintendo completely forgot about them, but late last night we did indeed get an update: and we're getting not one, not two, but three Mario GBA games for the Switch Online + Expansion Pack catalog.\nThis isn't much of a surprise, as Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3 was released in February for Expansion Pack subscribers, so this is just completing the set. According to Nintendo, all three games are due out on May 26, and it seems like this is what we're getting for the month.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRyFVwRqUKI\nAre these Mario GBA games worth playing?\nAs someone who owned all three on the GBA when they came out: kinda!\nMario Advance 1 is likely going to be one of the more popular picks, as it transforms Super Mario Bros. 2 quite a bit: remixing the game's layouts in clever ways while adding challenges. But the art and audio styles are polarizing, and ultimately, as the game goes on, you notice less and less of those stark changes: to the point where some people just prefer to play the original (which is on Switch via the NES app).\nThat sentiment also applies to Super Mario World and Yoshi's Island, which are both on the SNES Switch app, but there are plenty of GBA-version fans out there who might sway you on those.\nYeah but can we get any version of Four Swords on Switch though?\nThis is a perfect opportunity for Nintendo to re-release Four Swords on the Switch: which arrived back in 2002 thanks to the \"The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past and Four Swords\" GBA release. We'll also settle for the Four Swords Anniversary edition that came to the DS in 2011 (and the 3DS in 2013), and if they can spare the time; a remaster/remake of Four Swords Adventures from the GameCube, which would play nice with the multi-system local play nature of the Switch.\nThe post A trio of Mario GBA games are coming to Switch in May appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Do you think they'll follow through?\nIn case you missed it, Take-Two's newest financial report had a lot of bullish claims, championed by current CEO Strauss Zelnick. In addition to targeting an unprecedented amount of revenue in FY2025, some concerns were raised over specific platforms: most notably, the Switch, and a potential shift to updated current-gen consoles.\nSpeaking to Gamesindustry.biz, Zelnick notes that they're putting a lot on the line when it comes to their \"immersive core\" games, which currently consist of WWE 2K24, NBA 2K24...and an \"eagerly-anticipated new IP from one of [their] premiere studios.\" But what about the Switch? Well, that's TBD.\nThere is...something there, at least. LEGO 2K Drive does indeed launch today on Switch, with the dubious Star Wars Hunters coming later this year following a delay. When asked about future support in FY2025, Zelnick gave a rather muted response, noting: \"Yes, I think we'll continue to support it.\" When pressed about a potential \"console refresh\" (read: a boosted/souped-up theoretical Xbox Series X or PS5 \"Pro\"), Zelnick said that \"we probably will\" see it happen, and that \"they [console refreshes] did not affect the business very much,\" referring to the PS4 Pro and Xbox One X. The Zynga acquisition and faith in the mobile market are also a heavy focus for Take-Two going into the next few fiscal years.\nWell, with all that info, it seems like we know where 2K stands going forward. They're taking a \"wait and see\" approach with Switch, they're focusing on PC, mobile, and Sony/Microsoft consoles, and they won't change much strategically if there's another \"half-generation bump.\" So mostly business as usual.\nThe post Take-Two boss says he “thinks” they’ll continue to support the Switch after canceling Midnight Suns on it appeared first on Destructoid.",

That said there are still some lingering issues to address, and thankfully, they've been minor thus far.\nVersion 1.1.1 was released late on May 18, and it fixes a progress-blocking issue with the main story quest The Closed Door. Apparently, some folks were having problems with it \"even if they fulfilled the conditions to advance the quest,\" but now that's fixed, among the classic vague \"several issues have been addressed to improve the gameplay experience\" line from Nintendo.\nWithout spoiling anything, The Closed Door is a very early game quest, so if it's bugged, it's super annoying. At the very least it's easy to just do a clean wipe and restart, but simply updating your game to version 1.1.1 is the ideal situation.\nYou can find the full patch notes below!\nVer. 1.1.1 (Released May 18, 2023) [Full patch notes]\nGeneral Updates\nFixed issue where, sometimes, the player could not clear main quest “The Closed Door,” even if they fulfilled the conditions to advance the quest.\n\nIf you have already encountered this issue, you will be able to clear the quest by downloading this update data.\nSeveral issues have been addressed to improve the gameplay experience.\nThe post New Tears of the Kingdom patch fixes a progress bug appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Even more wizards and legends\nThe spellcasting roguelite Wizard of Legend is getting a sequel. Wizard of Legend II is a follow-up to 2018's Wizard of Legend, and it's shifting from 2D to 3D.\nAnnounced during today's Humble Games Showcase 2023, Wizard of Legend II is being published by Humble and developed by Dead Mage, the studio behind Children of Morta. The publisher confirmed during today's showcase that Wizard of Legend is now a Humble-owned IP. Original Wizard of Legend developer Contingent99 is \"on board\" and consulting on the project, according to Humble.\nOne big difference between Wizard of Legend II and its predecessor is in their style. While you still have the robed rogue mage look, the sequel is opting for an overhead 3D view rather than the pixel 2D style from the first.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdnI5FGQ2Sg\nIt sounds like other elements remain similar, though. Up to four players can hop in, maintaining the co-op appeal of the first Wizard of Legend. It's a roguelite adventure, with plenty of spell combinations to explore and interactions to discover. The adventure seems to evolve each time, so it's once again aiming for a run-based dungeon dive.\nBecoming legend\nThere's no planned release date at this point in time, just a confirmation that it's in development and a Steam page. I did like the original Wizard of Legend, so I'm curious to see what Dead Mages makes with the franchise.\nI'm also curious to see what Contingent99 could get up to, as well. As much as I like a new take on the Wizard of Legend, Contingent99's action and art were a solid mix. I'm hopeful that team's got something in the works, too.\nYou can follow and wishlist Wizard of Legend II here.\nThe post Wizard of Legend II has been announced for PC appeared first on Destructoid.",

The detective game will arrive on Nintendo's handheld console next week on May 25, 2023.\nBoth the base game and the recently released DLC, Golden Idol Mysteries: The Spider of Lanka, will be coming to the Switch eShop. The Case of the Golden Idol will go for $17.99, while The Spider of Lanka DLC will cost $5.99.\nPublisher Playstack has put up a trailer, showing a little bit about what the game's about and how the Switch version will handle Golden Idol.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shlRIGFUfYc\nThe Case of the Golden Idol is a detective game where the player is taken through a series of vignettes. Each one centers around a gruesome death, as well as a golden idol that seems to be causing quite a ruckus. The player has to observe the scene, pulling keywords from text and other sources to then fill in answers about what's happened.\nWhodunnit?\nColor Gray Games' mystery has some clear similarities to games like Return of the Obra Dinn. It's pretty open in terms of letting the player try, fail, and try again to solve the mystery, but having a definite set of options and clear framework might help less investigatively-inclined folks solve their way through it.\nI played The Case of the Golden Idol last year in a Discord server with friends, and I can't recommend that format enough. It's an enjoyable game to think through and solve together, and the revelations you uncover case-over-case are pretty great. The art style of Golden Idol is also unlike most other games out there; initially, I was a bit hesitant about it. But over time, the look of Golden Idol grew on me. I haven't played the Spider of Lanka DLC yet, but it's good to see this team is still exploring the world and structures it built for Golden Idol.\nThe Case of the Golden Idol hits Nintendo Switch on May 25.\nThe post The Case of the Golden Idol and its DLC are coming to Switch on May 25 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Sexy both on AND offline\nNo More Robots has announced that the FPS spin-off of Hypnospace Outlaw has a release date. Slayers X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengance of the Slayer is dropping on June 1st.\nHypnospace Outlaw was an extremely special game. While it took place in a fantasy reality, it created a loving time capsule of Web 1.0. The developers created various fictional characters to present a very accurate depiction of the internet in its awkward adolescence. It was rather spot on, and I know this because I lived Web 1.0.\nOne of the characters was this edgy teenager called Zane Lofton. Like many teenagers, Zane lived in a self-centered fantasy land where he was the king of cool. Slayers X is a further exploration of that character, this time through an FPS that he and his friend developed. It looks to drag us by the hair right back to 1998 when teenagers tinkered with Doom and Duke Nukem 3D modding tools.\nI also did that, but I wasn’t a teenager yet, so nothing ever came of it aside from a few poorly textured rooms.\nhttps://youtu.be/-bZRPUTNJBc\nZane Rocks\nWe’ve had plenty of shooters try to recapture the ‘90s to varying degrees of success, but Slayers X might be the first one to try to present itself through the lens of a character living at the time. As such, it’s packed with everything edgy teenagers found cool back then: bad guys, real-world environments, and poop. It’s trite and tacky, and that’s exactly how it should be.\nAs a fan of everything jank-pop, Slayers X absolutely sings to me. Hypnospace Outlaw still lives in a corner of my brain, and I’ve been excited to see more from the concept. The spin-off was announced a while back, and I was recently wondering if I had somehow missed it. I’m glad that’s not the case, and I can resume being excited.\nSlayers X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengance of the Slayer releases on PC June 1.

But if you want, there's a ton of tools at your disposal to craft all sorts of helpful vehicles and contraptions that can nudge you along. Hmm, it sure would be helpful if someone could create a database to track them all: well, Twitter user AKREW Daniel Luu did just that!\nThe site is called ZeldaBuilds.gg, and allows users to sign up and share their own creations, or peruse others for inspiration. It also has a fantastic \"materials\" section to help break down all of the game's Zonai Devices, in case you're getting overwhelmed. Not every creation uses every possible part; so it's a great way to take stock. And if you get really into it and want to amass a pile of devices to bust out and start creating stuff at any time, there's a handy list of all of the Zonai dispensers right here. Make sure you do not click the \"uses\" link unless you want a few boss spoilers though!\nOrbital Strike Laser Cannon\nu/0KdQ6 in tearsofthekingdom\n\n\nThere are some real gems on there\nOne of the most impressive builds shared around is the \"Satellite Laser Cannon,\" also called the orbital strike laser cannon in some places, which you can see in action above.

That Man.\nArc System Works has finally lifted the lid on the final Season 2 DLC character headed to the gorgeous scrapper Guilty Gear Strive — And, of no surprise to anybody whatsoever, next week will see the coming of the powerful central figure in the current GG timeline, Asuka R#, more commonly known as \"That Man\".\nThe powerful warrior-sorcerer, whose aim to bring peace and pleasance to Earth led to globe-shattering events of biblical proportions, will bring his ethereal skills to the battlefield on May 25. A new trailer showcases what appears to be one of the most complex and technical fighters in franchise history, (and with GG, that's really saying something), who is armed with over 20 spells with which to confuse their opponent, control space, defend against attack and, of course, kick a lotta ass.\nYou can see That Man in action in the preview below. Yikes.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpxOjoBDJBY&t=1s\nIn addition to Asuka R#'s arrival, Guilty Gear Strive Season Pass owners will also receive the new stage Tir Na N0g, as well as two special 25th-anniversary color packs, bringing additional palettes that can be applied to the entire roster of characters. These include a pink-and-white scheme, a neon green-and-white scheme, and finally an orange-and-white scheme. The pink-and-white look will be available to download to all players free of charge.\nFinally, Arc System Works confirmed that a third season of content for Guilty Gear Strive is in the works, bringing even more characters, stages, and colors to the hit release. Players can also expect the arrival of the long-long-long awaited update that hopes to bring myriad fixes to the title's frustrating lobby and online issues.\nGuilty Gear Strive is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.\nThe post Asuka R# finally unveiled as Guilty Gear Strive DLC, Season 3 incoming appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Publisher targeting an unprecedented $8 billion in revenue\nTake-Two Interactive, the parent publisher behind Rockstar Games and the Grand Theft Auto franchise, has announced that it is preparing for what it believed will be a record-shattering fiscal year 2025. The comments were made by CEO Strauss Zelnick in the company's newest financial report.\n\"Fiscal 2025 is a highly anticipated year for our company. For the last several years, we have been preparing our business to release an incredibly robust pipeline of projects that we believe will take our company to even greater levels of success,\" said Zelnick.\n\"In fiscal 2025, we expect to enter this new era by launching several groundbreaking titles that we believe will set new standards in our industry and enable us to achieve over $8 billion in net bookings and over $1 billion in adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow. We expect to sustain this momentum by delivering additional growth in our operating results in fiscal 2026 and beyond.\"\nConsidering the obscene amount of money referenced, as well as the supreme confidence delivered in the statement, one can only assume that the fiscal year 2024, (This period denotes the calendar year running from April 2024 to March 2025), will see the studio launch Grand Theft Auto VI, the latest release in a franchise that leaves almost every other gaming franchise in existence kicking in the dust when in comes to both immediate and long term revenue.\nWhen pressed as to whether this number essentially guaranteed the release window for GTA VI, Zelnick was non-commital, but it seems almost impossible for the \"industry standard setting\" revenue of $8 billion to be reached without some sort of major, and that's major, release. Grand Theft Auto V, a title that is now a decade old, continues to move copies, and currently sits at the 180 million sales mark.\nThe post GTA publisher Take-Two expects fiscal year 2025 to ‘set new standards’ in the industry appeared first on Destructoid.",

The first installment will go live on July 27, with more episodes to follow in the weeks after.\nThe Expanse series will be episodic, with five episodes in total. After the first drops on July 27, each episode will follow two weeks after each other, putting the targeted end date in September.\nThere's a standard edition for $39.99, or a Deluxe Edition for $44.99 that will give 24-hour early access on PlayStation or Epic, and also future DLC. Yes, Telltale confirms DLC is on the way, though it doesn't clarify what shape that will take.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzG5WI5ak1g\nAll part of the churn\nThis new Expanse series arrives from the revived Telltale Games, under LCG Entertainment. While it's rolled out games like the Shadow Edition of the Batman Telltale series, The Expanse is one the studio has been building up to for a while, in collaboration with Life is Strange: True Colors developer Deck Nine.\nTelltale also confirmed that The Wolf Among Us 2, its follow-up to the previous Fable adventure, is delayed into 2024. The shift is to avoid crunch, and move from Unreal 4 to 5, according to an IGN interview at the time.\nThis will be an interesting one to watch, to see what the new Telltale is putting out. Deck Nine's involvement certainly has me intrigued, as True Colors was a really solid entry in the Life is Strange series, and I'm a fan of The Expanse too. Opting for an episodic structure similar to what old Telltale popularized has me curious about its reception, though. At the very least, it will be weeks between episodes rather than months.\nWe'll see if the sci-fi drama's gradual rollout works. The Expanse: A Telltale Series premieres on July 27 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Epic.\nThe post The Expanse: A Telltale Series kicks off its episodic run in July appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Die. Mutate. Repeat.\nAcclaimed roguelite Dead Cells is getting set to bring its compelling and amorphous adventure to your local coffee table, courtesy of a brand new board game currently in production at Le Scorpion Masque.\nThe Montreal-based studio, which has previously produced board games such as Decrypto, Zombie Kidz, and Stay Cool, launched a Kickstarter for Dead Cells, which will be the company's first licensed title. While the crowdfunding kicked off with a modest target of around $30,000 USD, the campaign has, at the writing of writing, surpassed a staggering $250,000, with 15 days still to go. As such, the game will now go into production. A release window is yet to be announced.\nhttps://youtu.be/rfl-gb3M520\nThe Dead Cells board game will look to retain both the visual aesthetic, immersive atmosphere, and general gameplay of Motion Twin's 2018 release, as 1-4 players pick their way through ever-shifting dungeons in co-operative action, as they battle through High Peak Castle en route to a confrontation with the nefarious Hand of The King. One of four uniquely skilled Beheaded can be chosen, and the board will retain the Die/Repeat nature of its roguelike origins.\nYou can check out a breakdown of a pre-production copy in the video below, courtesy of the board game fans at Good Time Society.\nhttps://youtu.be/qny-UMI4y1Q\nExplore biomes, level up your character, defeat enemies, conquer challenges, and lose it all on the turn of a card. Level up your Beheaded, earn permanent upgrades, and work with your fellow team members to defeat what seems, at first glance, a near-insurmountable challenge. But strategy, synergy, and persistence can pay off in the end, or you'll simply die, and die, and die, and die trying.\nYou can check out a full breakdown of Dead Cells on the official Kickstarter.\nDead Cells is available now on PS4, PC, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and iOS/Android platforms.\nThe post Dead Cells smashes its Kickstarter for board game adaptation appeared first on Destructoid.",

It’s currently only announced for PC and only has a release window of 2024.\nTeenage Demon Slayer Society bills itself as “a bold new turn-based take on character action games, featuring style ranks, customizable movesets, and cool, endearing characters.” Strangely, my brain can make sense of that salad of descriptors, which is sad, because I get confused when paperwork asks for my address.\nhttps://youtu.be/nmm2POiMNXQ\nA trailer dropped alongside the announcement, showing off the game's style. I dig it. I like turn-based strategy that involves exactly one character. It’s not really all that much different than moving a bunch of characters around, but it makes me feel cool.\nReal demons\nSince Strange Scaffold is best known for An Airport for Aliens Currently Run by Dogs and Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator, Teenage Demon Slayer Society kind of blows my mind. Those two games employ more of a jank-pop aesthetic, whereas this one looks more like a stylish anime. It makes sense, though, since Japan is the only place where teenagers fight demons anymore. Actual sexy demons, I mean. Not like alcoholism or the imaginary kind that televangelists and Alex Jones shout at you about.\nThis is also quite the pace that Strange Scaffold has going on. It’s the development label of Xalavier Nelson Jr., whose work extends to a number of other great games beyond Strange Scaffold and into places like Hypnospace Outlaw. It feels like An Airport for Aliens Currently Run by Dogs was released yesterday, but because time has no meaning, it was actually 2021. Still, Teenage Demon Slayer Society joins Sunshine Shuffle and El Paso, Elsewhere in upcoming titles from the developer.\nTeenage Demon Slayer Society is Currently only announced for PC.

          "description": "A lot of rupees\nIt may have just come out on Friday, May 12, 2023, but The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is already selling faster than any other title in the series.\nHow many? Holy crap, 10 million so far. I come from an era when 1 million was this massive, unattainable milestone that few ever reached. Now games are crossing that mark in a few days. And as the press release points out (via BusinessWire), “with over 4 million sold in the Americas, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is also the fastest-selling Nintendo Switch game and the fastest-selling Nintendo game for any system in that territory.”\nFun fact, the original Legend of Zelda sold an estimated 6.5 million on NES. Meanwhile, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild has sold around 30 million copies. So, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom still has some catching up to do, but it’s off to an incredible start.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHGShqcAHlQ\nTears of the Kingdom is the perfect storm for sales. Its direct predecessor (ignoring the Link’s Awakening remake) was already well-received and sold like hotcakes. Any game in The Legend of Zelda series is already going to be hotly anticipated, and Tears of the Kingdom was well-received by critics. It was announced back in 2019, and since then has been like a cow being slowly lowered into a tank of piranhas. There’s no surprise that the piranhas are now gorging themselves.\nPersonally, I’m enjoying it. I’m among the many who loved Breath of the Wild, and Tears of the Kingdom feels like an extension of that. A lot of puzzle-solving is based around building things, which is a feature that works just fine for me. I don’t spend a lot of time getting overly creative because I prefer to focus on the exploration, but I still enjoy it just fine. I guess I’m just joining the chorus here.\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is available now on Nintendo Switch.\nThe post The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is the fastest selling game in the series appeared first on Destructoid.",

The confirmation of first-party PlayStation Studios news is likely enticing, given that Sony's State of Play streams in 2023 so far have focused more on third-party titles.\nIt's certainly an opportunity for something like Marvel's Spider-Man 2, which is expected to arrive this year, to resurface. Several other upcoming games from frequent PlayStation partners could be possible, too. I know I'd be interested in some more details on something like Death Stranding 2.\nIt also runs just a little bit ahead of June, where the summer of gaming news has slowly but surely congregated. Even without an E3 to bind them all together, streams from companies like Xbox and Ubisoft are still taking place, as well as Summer Game Fest and its kickoff stream.\nPlayStation's getting a little ahead of that curve with a May 24 show.

          "description": "It's Ghost\nNintendo has announced that it will be delisting Bandai Namco's fun Paccle Royale, (no, it doesn't work, does it?), title Pac-Man 99 this fall. Currently available from the Nintendo eShop as a benefit to Nintendo Switch Online subscribers, the game will be unable to download from October 8.\nPlayers who own either paid edition of the game — Pac-Man 99 Deluxe Pack or Pac-Man 99 Mode Unlock — will still be able to access CPU Battle, Time Attack, and Blind Score Attack in an offline capacity. Additionally, all purchased themes and cosmetic items will still be available. All online services for the title are to be suspended, however, which is pretty frustrating given that this is the foundation of the Pac-Man 99 gimmick.\nNo reason was given for the decision because Nintendo gon' Nintendo, but the title hasn't seen quite the same level of success as its sibling, Tetris 99, which launched back in the fall of 2019. There could also be an expiring license issue, given the pill-popper's torrid legacy with red tape. Or, Nintendo could simply be doing it because why not? It be that way sometimes.\nPac-Man 99 is available now on Nintendo Switch, players wishing to enjoy the offline modes after delisting will need to pick up the Pac-Man 99 Deluxe Pack or Pac-Man 99 Mode Unlock.\nThe post Pac-Man 99 to be delisted from Nintendo eShop this fall appeared first on Destructoid.",

Team Ninja and Koei Tecmo partnered with Square Enix to reimagine the story of the first Final Fantasy, creating a lovably irreverent protagonist with Jack Garland in the process.\nIt was, by all accounts, a solid vision of an action-driven, alternative take on Final Fantasy's origins. The team continued to build on it over time, with more downloadable content and jobs, adding some classic pieces of Final Fantasy mythos in the process.\nWith the recent release of the Steam version, we got a chance to catch up with director Daisuke Inoue and ask some burning lingering questions about Stranger of Paradise, now a little over a year since its launch.

First released throughout the early 2000s, these games are enhanced portable remakes of Super Mario Bros. 2, Super Mario World, and Super Mario World 2: Yoshi’s Island, respectively. \n\n\nAlthough the original versions of each game is already available in the NES/SNES libraries, the Advance series features several tweaks, such as Advance 2 giving Luigi his Super Mario Bros. 2 jump. These join Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3, which was in the initial batch of GBA titles, to complete the series.

Version 1.1.1 of the game fixes one very specific problem, but also ambiguously addresses issues to improve the gameplay experience. You find the patch notes below, as well as on Nintendo's website.\nFixed issue where, sometimes, the player could not clear main quest “The Closed Door,” even if they fulfilled the conditions to advance the quest.\n\t\nIf you have already encountered this issue, you will be able to clear the quest by downloading this update data.\nSeveral issues have been addressed to improve the gameplay experience.\nDespite both Tears of the Kingdom and Breath of the Wild being incredibly solid games out of the gate, even Zelda is not immune to patches, but Nintendo tends to keep the changes vague. Many of Breath of the Wild's patch notes simply pointed to the updates making the game a more pleasant experience. It seems the trajectory of Tears of the Kingdom's patch notes might receive the same ambiguous details if the second bullet point is an indication of what's to come.\nFor more on Zelda, you can read Game Informer's Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom review, our beginner tips guide, our interview with producer and director Eiji Aonuma and Hidemaro Fujibayashi, our Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Amiibo guide, this feature of stupid screenshots, and a tip of how to find interesting sidequests.",

Fortunately, Switch owners can put on their thinking hats when the dark mystery game heads to the platform next week.\nOn May 25, The Case of the Golden Idol lands on Switch alongside its recently released expansion, The Spider of Lanka. Both titles can be purchased separately or together in a bundle. The award-winning game takes place in the 18th century and tasks you with solving a mystery spanning decades over 11 bizarre, interconnected deaths. Each scenario is presented as static scenes where players must carefully observe the environment to find clues revealing who each character is, how the person died, and the chronological order of events. The Spider of Lanka serves as a prequel that adds three additional cases. \nThe Switch version sports a redesigned UI to better accommodate a controller-based experience. If this is the first you've heard of the game, the trailer below provides a good idea of what to expect.\n\n\nAs a fan of The Case of the Golden Idol, it's great to see it come to more platforms, and Switch should be an especially good fit.

Thankfully, a lengthy trailer gives us the good fortune of enjoying some action-packed gameplay footage. \nThis reimagining/reboot of its 2014 predecessor is coming on Friday, October 13. A big new trailer set to Iron Maiden packs in a ton of metal-infused action that shows off the game's Unreal Engine 5-rendered graphics. \n\n\nIt's been a long road for Lords of the Fallen, which began life as Lords of the Fallen 2 years ago before development restarted from scratch. It was re-announced as The Lords of the Fallen last year before reverting back to its original name. The Souls-inspired game's open world is five times larger than the original's and supports online co-op. The combat has also been retuned to be faster and more fluid, and developer Hexworks promises the game to be an overall expansive action RPG experience. \nWe're looking forward to seeing the result of this overhaul when the game comes to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

The game was first announced in 2021 as a co-op PvE-focused experience about working together to battle invading alien machines. Now, the game will have a PvP element thrown into the mix.\nIn an update, Embark reveals that since delaying Arc Raiders to focus on finishing its other upcoming title, The Finals, it’s added competitive play as well as an extraction element. The game still unfolds on a far future Earth ravaged by sentient machines, but now teams must compete with other human players in addition to the in-game enemies. Furthermore, the game adopts extraction-based objectives by tasking players to locate and retrieve resources scattered across the world for their squad. Here’s Embark's pitch for what Arc Raiders now entails:\nEmbark plans on launching a closed alpha test, giving players who sign up on their website the first opportunity to go hands-on with Arc Raiders. The game still has no release date, but it’s coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.\nWhat do you think of this new premise for Arc Raiders? Let us know in the comments.",

In addition to showcasing first-party PlayStation Studios titles, the event will also highlight third-party and indie games. \nThis means it's time to put on our speculation hats.

          "description": "Believe it or not, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is off to a fantastic start. In addition to garnering an overwhelmingly positive critical reception, over 10 million copies of the hotly anticipated sequel have already been sold within its first three days of release.\nThat number makes Tears of the Kingdom the fastest-selling entry in franchise history. A press release states that 4 million of those sales have been in the Americas, which not only makes it the fastest-selling Switch game in this territory but the fastest-selling Nintendo game period. This achievement is even more impressive when you consider that Tears of the Kingdom is also the first $70 Nintendo first-party title, showing fans are willing to shell out the extra dough for a tentpole Switch release. \nFor more on The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, check out our review. We also have some spoiler-free beginner’s tips and an amiibo guide, plus an interview with Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma and director Hidemaro Fujibayashi.",

          "description": "During a developer livestream today, Blizzard revealed its roadmap for the coming months. The roadmap, which was presented by game director Aaron Keller and executive producer Jared Neuss, details what is coming during Season 5, 6, 7, and beyond. In addition to PvP updates, the Overwatch 2 developers also gave us an idea of when to expect the long-awaited PvE experience that was announced alongside the game in 2019.\nSeason 5, which has the theme of \"Mischief and Magic,\" is currently set to kick off on June 13. This fifth season of the live-service shooter brings events and modes, including a new limited-time event called Questwatch, as well as the return of the Summer Games event. The roadmap also promises a cinematic reveal, a 5v5 mini comp season, the Creator Workshop mode, and the return of the On Fire mechanic that was present in Overwatch.\nSeason 6, which is set for later this summer, is heralded by Blizzard as the single largest drop of new gameplay released at one time since Overwatch 2 launched in October of last year. Season 6 promises a new support hero, Flashpoint, Hero Mastery, a Firing Range, a player progression system, and the annual Overwatch anniversary event. Perhaps most importantly, Season 6 gives players the PvE content that was announced back in 2019, as Story Missions arrive as part of Season 6. Unfortunately, the Hero Missions PvE mode has been cut from the team's plans.\nFinally, we learned what players can expect from Season 7 and beyond, which includes a new tank hero, reworks of longtime heroes Roadhog and Sombra, a new Control map, a new winter event, new Hero Mastery missions in multiplayer, cinematic debuts, the return of fan-favorite modes and Competitive Mastery heroes, a new limited-time collaboration event mode, and a new lore codex.\nOverwatch 2 launched on October 4, 2022. While the initial response was positive (read our review here), the approach to supporting the game and the season pass structure has deterred many players from keeping up with the title.",

          "description": "The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is a huge game that is particularly skilled at providing you with distractions. I crossed the 90-hour mark recently, and my in-game percentage tracker still shows less than 50% completion. Sometimes, however, you may run into a situation where you're not sure where you want to go. When that happens, I suggest talking to Patricia.\nPatricia is not a human character in Tears of the Kingdom. She's a sand seal, and Riju's personal sand seal at that. After cleaning up the main quest in Gerudo, you will find her in the southern corner of Gerudo town.\nPatricia loves to eat and will share bits of ambiguous wisdom, translated by her handler Padda, when you give Patricia food. Her favorite food, however, is Splash Fruit.\nIf you give her some splash fruit, her caretaker will let you know that she has spoken a string of strange numbers.\nThose numbers are, of course, coordinates, which you can find on the map or on the bottom of the minimap as you are exploring.\nIn the example I took screenshots of for this guide, it sent me to a person out in the middle of nowhere who happened to have a sidequest for me. I've done this a few times with Patricia, and she has always pointed me toward something I have not yet discovered.\nRunning out of things to do in Tears of the Kingdom is something that many players (myself included) won't run into for many hours, but it's nice to know there is an in-game database of distractions built into the game when you run out of activities.\nFor more on Zelda, you can read Game Informer's Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom review, our beginner tips guide, our interview with producer and director Eiji Aonuma and Hidemaro Fujibayashi, our Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Amiibo guide, and this feature of stupid screenshots.",

          "description": "Ranked Play is coming to Fortnite, and it's coming soon. According to a blog post from last Saturday, the team behind Fortnite will implement the new mode in the 24.40 update, introducing eight main ranks players can progress through. If Epic keeps to their usual schedule, the mode is expected to come this week, but a date has yet to be formally announced.\nOnce Ranked Play is added to the game, players will be able to toggle it on or off from the main menu. Other than the fact that it's generally more competitive, there aren't any major gameplay differences between Ranked and unranked play, though that's subject to change. In fact, most details about Ranked Play are not concrete, as Epic says this mode is going to be the start of Ranked Season Zero, so they can \"make any adjustments to issues and concerns that arise, while also working on additional features and overall improvements for when Ranked starts following the normal Battle Royale Season schedule.\"\nRanked Play will be available for both Battle Royale and its popular alternative, Zero Build. You'll have separate ranks for each mode. However, since Ranked Play is still in development, only certain party sizes will be available. In Battle Royale, you can play Solos, Duos, and Party (this excludes trios), and in Zero Build, you can only play duos. Ranked Play's Season Zero is set to end when the main season ends (early June), so hopefully, more party options will open up by then.\nRanked Play will also replace Fortnite's existing Arena mode. Other than the Console Champions Cup, the rest of the tournaments this season won't have any Ranked requirements. Eligibility for future tournaments will now rely on your rank and \"other factors\" Epic has yet to specify.\nWill you be playing Ranked Mode once it drops? Let us know in the comments!",

          "description": "Fans of first-person shooters and old-timey cartoons should keep an eye on Mouse. The recently announced game slaps the classic animation of yesteryear over a retro shooter template to create an experience that's old-school in more ways than one. \nMouse comes from Polish indie developer Fumi Games and is billed as a noir story-driven shooter about murder and deception set in a corrupt city. Players control a private detective wielding vintage firearms like a Tommy Gun, revolver, and Carcano rifle to blast the rather adorable rodent enemies.\nThe game’s Steam page describes Mouse as a play-your-way type of experience, emphasized by a power-up system in which players can collect special abilities and weapon upgrades that cater to a chosen playstyle. The trailer shows the game is very much a work-in-progress, but it’s already an eye-catcher. \n\n\nMouse is rendered in the classic rubber hose animation style that defined early 20th-century animation, which has found new life in video games such as Cuphead and Bendy and the Ink Machine. The game has no release window but will come to PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.",

Despite its numerous changes to Zelda’s formula, Breath of the Wild was a massive success and its legacy only grows stronger with time.\nTo give Breath of the Wild a direct sequel (a rarity in Zelda canon) is a dangerous prospect.

          "description": "We know Mortal Kombat 12 is apparently coming sometime this year, and Ed Boon is stoking the fires of excitement by seemingly teasing an impending announcement.\nIn a Warner Bros. Discovery earnings call in February, CEO David Zaslav told investors that Mortal Kombat 12 was planned for release this year. Initially, Boon didn’t confirm or deny the news, but today he tweeted out a short video of a clock hand dramatically ticking towards 12 that then, interestingly, skips over it to strike 1. Boon's tweet asks, “Does anyone know what time it is?”\nDoes anyone know what time it is? #MortalKombatpic.twitter.com/pXY2wlidde\nMay 10, 2023\nIt might be the 12th mainline fighting game, but the teaser could be hinting at a reboot of sorts. Regardless, it appears an announcement could be imminent, which seems especially likely following the big delay of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. Summer Game Fest is less than a month away, so it wouldn’t be surprising to see the hotly anticipated sequel pop up there.\nMortal Kombat 11 was released in 2019, with its Aftermath expansion arriving the following year. Developer Netherrealm also released Mortal Kombat: Onslaught, a mobile RPG, last fall. Although Netherrealm has released an Injustice game in between Mortal Kombat releases since 2013, it appears to be bucking that trend by jumping straight to the 12th entry. \nWhat do you want to see in Mortal Kombat 12?

Her return triggers a flood of childhood memories, which players relieve in flashbacks as a child version of Mimi. Gameplay involves exploring the cottage, taking pictures, and collecting keepsakes while witnessing the bond between Mimi and her grandmother and learning how these nostalgic experiences connect to the present. Check out the game's new trailer below, as the game looks even prettier in motion. \n\n\nDordogne comes from developers Umanimation and UN JE NE SAIS QUOI and will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.",

Alongside this news, Game Freak has released the first piece of concept art for Project Bloom. You can check it out below: \n\n\"We're thrilled to have the opportunity to create new IP that is bold and tonally different from our prior work,\" Game Freak director Kota Furushima writes in the release. \"From the beginning, Private Division was the publisher we wanted to work with on our new game. Their track record and global expertise gives us all the confidence to create a sweeping new action-adventure game that we can't wait to share more about in the future.\" \nTake-Two Interactive chief strategy officer and Private Division head Micahel Worosz says you'd be hard-pressed to find a studio with more iconic hits over the past 30 years than Game Freak, addding, \"We're ready to help Game Freak unleash their potential and we're honored to be the first Western publisher to work alongside this exceptionally talented and proven team to bring a bold new IP to market.\" \nGame Freak was founded in 1989 and is best known for developing the majority of mainline Pokémon entries across various Nintendo consoles. Its most recent Pokémon release was last year's Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. It has, however, released non-Pokémon games throughout its history, including this year's Pocket Card Jockey: Ride On! on iOS and macOS devices. \nPrivate Division was founded in 2017 as a third publishing label within Take-Two Interactive.

Join us today Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central as we kick of the adventure, which will continue each week until we roll credits. We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel (or you can watch the videos in the above playlist). \nBanjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.\nJoin me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey. \nWatch on Twitch!\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

Harmony: The Fall of Reverie is a choice-driven adventure starring Polly, a woman who returns home to find her missing mother. It's here Polly discovers she has clairvoyant abilities connecting her to a strange dimension called Reverie. While visiting this world, Polly becomes Harmony and encounters six powerful god-like beings called Aspirations, which serve as the hearts of humanity such as Glory, Power, Chaos, Bliss, and Truth. \n\n\nPolly must restore the balance between Reverie and our world and decide which Aspiration ultimately inspires humanity by making decisions represented by a system called the Augural. This web presents a multitude of scenes players will jump between that reveal possible futures that, in turn, unlock additional story branches. Polly does this by collecting crystals given to her with each choice and character bond she makes, which are used to unlock nodes on the Augural that alter the course of the story. \nHarmony: The Fall of Reverie sports a vibrantly illustrated art direction and a soundtrack by award-winning composer Lena Raine. You can try it out early thanks to a limited-time Steam demo launching today that will be available until May 21.\nFor more on Don't Nod, check out its other new title, Banishers: Ghosts of a New Eden, which also launches later this year.",

But its failure is a disappointing situation for several reasons. Developer Arkane is one of my favorite studios, so it sucks to see it fumble the ball. My admiration for the team made me genuinely excited for Redfall, which I still think is a cool premise on paper, making it a tough pill to swallow in practice. But the most upsetting element is seeing a studio fall short after trying something new and getting criticized for even attempting it.  \nThere are many valid reasons to drive a stake through Redfall’s heart, but the most worrying sentiment I’ve seen is Arkane should have never made it and given us Dishonored 3 or Prey 2 instead. That’s an understandable wish; I…",
