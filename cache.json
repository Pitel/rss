Except when you stick three of the same building type together, they all zhuup together to create an even bigger one. And a bigger one, and a bigger one. It's very satisfying. The smooshing lights up all the same parts of my brain that Threes did when I became obsessed with it about five years ago, while the tile planning hits scratches that big Dorfromantik itch, making for an excellent Steam Next Fest demo experience.  \nRead more",

There is certainly something magical about watching masters of the genre weave effortlessly in and out of flying orbs in the likes of Gradius, R-Type and Ikaruga, but whenever I attempt to step up to the gamepad myself, my movements have always proven too flighty, too seized by panic, to make much headway with them. Enter The Knight Witch, which takes the thrill of the bullet hell shooter and wraps it up in a lovely Metroid-like-shaped package my brain can actually understand. It's a fantastic little game, and I'm only sorry we didn't cover it in more detail when it came out at the end of November last year.\nRead more",

It takes your mouse and turns it into a sword, or a shield, or an arm that's capable of swatting away an explosive potion. It may be like something you, dear reader, have played in the past, but me? Nah, never played anything quite like it! Well, that's a lie. If anything, it's the first fantasy RPG that's made use of my latent - and highly dubious - CS:GO skills and brought to mind a rhythm game called Osu! I am very impressed indeed.\nRead more",

Both Microsoft and Activision Blizzard believe the deal will encourage competition in the gaming space, rather than hinder it.\r\n\n \nRead more",

For one, it’s huge. It towers above the forest trees and looks like it could easily stomp unwanted visitors to death. When the young witch approaches the towering beast, it bends is legs to sit down, almost burring itself in the earth for her access to the house on top.\nRead more",

Shampoo, bubble bath and toothpaste. Salad cream, yeast and lemonade. These concoctions were the result of pure genius, a brilliant mind capable of harmonising with ingredients on a sub-atomic level to create combinations that were beyond the capabilities of any known god. My Mam was only shouting at me because she didn’t understand. These were my elixirs! Sup from this bowl and taste the future of human evolution! Yes, I know this is the same bowl we’re also sick into when we’re not feeling well, but you also bake in it so let’s not start being picky. \r\n\n\r\nAs I got older, It became apparent my future was not in alchemy. Someone who puts baby corn into a bolognese clearly doesn't posses the skill to create balanced mixtures.

So, obviously, the natural choice to replace Commander Shepard is… Michael Scott?

What's not to love? Living in a cute little thatched roof house, tending to your garden, baking bread, sipping magical teas, reading old tomes on the front porch - absolute bliss.\nWitchy Life Story is all about this lifestyle. It’s a fluffy, cosy visual novel where you play as a mischievous witch who is sent to live in a new town called Flora to prove themselves after royally flubbing their training. The town is preparing for a festival and, as the newly appointed town witch, you need to pull your weight by brewing potions, giving tarot readings, and even leading a guided meditation session or two.\nRead more",

          "description": "I hesitate to call Potion Tales a shop sim or retail management game, because the economics of running a figuratively and literally underground magic potion shop seems a secondary concern next to making the potions and deciding whether you want to screw people over or not. If the answer to that last part is yes, you need to move on to the question of how.\nIn practice, Potion Tales is a 3D puzzle game. People come to you - I use the term people broadly because the tutorial level involves helping a fire spirit and soon after you're approached by what appears to be an aggressive daisy who is the local gravekeeper - and present you with a problem. They ask for a potion to solve the problem. That's all the steer you get. It takes some getting used to, but the Steam demo shows an impressively flexible game with a good sense of humour.\nRead more",

There’s something meditative about being close to the water, waiting in silence for a catch, and mashing buttons to reel them in - plus I don’t need to deal with the horrendous smell from behind the safety of my desk. The indie game Dredge subverts what I like about fishing games, with an eerie eldritch horror waiting beneath the ocean’s surface. We won’t need to wait long before we see what's under there as Dredge releases on March 30th.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's a bit like Blood Bowl, oddly, in that it's all about mitigating risks. And like Blood Bowl, despite having a decent head for tactics and planning on the fly, I am hopeless at sticking to them when I see a new idea, thus: terrible. At it.\nBut since an update last March looks likely to be its last big one, it's about time to get over myself and gave it a proper look as a complete package. It's long overdue, in fact. Although I still struggle to fully enjoy it, Battle Brothers is an unusually good tactical game, and the one to beat for the burgeoning subgenre of mercenary management sims. That's partly because it sticks so resolutely to its guns. Where Bannerlord faltered by throwing extraneous stuff unrelated to the core combat that should have defined it, and other open world games typically take a varied but shallow \"do and be everything\" approach, Battle Brothers resists dilution of that core concept.\nRead more",

If KeokeN's Deliver Us games are anything to go by, though, life in outer space isn't all that peachy either. In Deliver Us The Moon, you may remember the scientists in charge of the moon's Earth-saving energy beam tech ended up having a bit of a Rapture moment, sabotaging all their good work (and the future of Earth in the process) and buggering off to goodness knows where to start life afresh in their newly birthed utopia. In its sequel, Deliver Us Mars, you find out those rogue astronauts didn't actually go that far at all. Yep, they hopped on over to the red planet and set up shop there, and when a strange transmission comes through revealing their location, it serves as the catalyst to send yet another crew into space to go and investigate. \r\n\nThis time, though, you're right at the heart of its central conflict. By casting players as Kathy, the daughter of one of those rogue astronauts, Deliver Us Mars tells a much more fraught and personal tale of what kind of future humanity should be pursuing: should we, in fact, be turning our efforts toward a life in outer space, or should we be doing everything in our power to try and save the dire, pretty much almost dead husk of a planet we call home? \nRead more",

Let your eyes go slack and gaze into the distance of an optical illusion as you jump around pretty little Magic Eye levels in this platformer which reminds me of VVVVVV.\nRead more",

Like Simogo's surreal thriller, most of Delete After Reading plays out like you're reading a novel, where scrolling through paragraphs of text will reveal images, clues and puzzles you can interact with. As the devs put it, Delete After Reading is a “game you can read, and a book you can play,” and looks and sounds really quite rad. Even better, it’s releasing on March 14th.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Enter Full Fathom.\nSo, Full Fathom isn’t out yet, or even has an official release date, but I just love the idea and look of this game. Being developed by Daemon House, this is an oceanic survival horror where you’re trapped in a derelict submarine that has sunken to the depths of an abyssal sea. You need to navigate your surroundings and keep the sub up and running to make your way back to civilisation, aka a rusty tin can is your last lifeline.\nRead more",

Indeed, just like the 2K Launcher last year, with the added irony that the affected games (which include The Division 2, Watch Dogs Legion and Ghost Recon Breakpoint) only arrived on Steam in the past few weeks. \nRead more",

I might smugly write something like “it elevates the genre” while sipping wine and eating cheese, musing on how a game pushes the media forward as an art form. Other times I just want to write that a game is really bloody good, actually, and I like it lots.\nHi-Fi Rush falls into the latter category. Developer Tango Gameworks shadow-dropped the rhythm-action game out of nowhere shortly after an Xbox presentation, jettisoning The Evil Within’s murky mental hospitals and Ghostwire: Tokyo's supernatural shinanigans for something markedly different: bright pulsating neon colours and a gang of loveable anime ruffians, where every whack and dodge is underscored by a beat. \nHi-Fi Rush is an action-adventure game with a mechanical core fuelled by musical beats. Protagonist Chai has undergone a risky medical procedure and emerged from the other side with a robot arm and an iPod accidentally implanted in his chest meaning his every waking moment is punctuated by a catchy beat. We too see these rhythmic motions, as Hi-Fi Rush's soda pop-infused world moves to this steady pulse - platforms move in time with the music, lights flash in pleasing rhythmic patterns, and enemies attack to the beat of the drum. \nRead more",

It’s Minecraft! Of course it was game of the year. It was arguably the game of the decade, an absolute all timer. I won’t spend many words explaining why it is good, because those words would be redundant fodder, like the bloke fighting a soaring dragon by poking the ground under his feet with a sword. I’ll give it a fair go so that Alice can’t say I didn’t try, and swiftly move on to reading all of your (hopefully) lovely comments about why you also like Minecraft.

But Yaza Games have taken a bit of a different direction with Inkulinati's vibe by adding a whole heap of cheeky humour.

When it emerged on the Epic Game Store in the autumn of 2021, you could see the conflict roiling in its belly - between the linear science fiction short story on the surface, and the freeroaming “Metroid snowboarding game” fighting to get out from underneath it.\n“Once the story finished, I hoped an endgame would open up and allow me to play freely in its world,” I wrote in our Jett review. “That I’d have more opportunities to watch great Ghoke, the red sun, rise in real time, and to ponder the Far Shore’s fascinating mysteries at length. Instead, I could only replay previous chapters. If only Jett had embraced a rhythm as organic as its inspired ecosystem.”\r\n\n\r\nWhen the Jett team read that review, they didn’t disagree. “You put your finger on it more accurately than anybody else, which was, ‘It really feels like this is building up to some sort of systemic-focused, open world endgame,’” says Superbrothers founder Craig Adams. “And internally we were like, ‘Yeah, it is.’” What they knew, and I didn’t, was that The Far Shore was just the first part of a two-campaign story. That journey has now been completed with the launch of Given Time, a bonus 12-hour adventure that coincides with Jett’s long-awaited Steam release. \r\n\n \nRead more",

Live services will go offline on February 28th at 4PM GMT/10AM CST/11AM ET. In a blog post from the team, Iron Galaxy shared that Season Two will be Rumbleverse’s last, but it should be receiving one final update soon to remove the game's monetisation. This continues the trend of me discovering a new battle royale game, thanks to the announcement of its death.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "I've played Shiny Shoe's upcoming roguelike Inkbound once before, and not only is it markedly different to their previous game Monster Train, but it also featured the snappiest turn-based combat I'd seen. With that in mind, I dove into the game's recent technical test with fellow RPS Treehouse-dwellers Ollie and James to sample the game at a more leisurely pace, and to draw upon their greater strategic expertise.

We had fun, but it didn't come quite as naturally without the guiding hand of the developers showing us the ropes.\nRead more",

          "description": "Fedora 38 nabídne celý Flathub. Od Fedory 35 platí, že pokud si v edici Workstation při úvodním nastavení povolíte zdroje třetích stran, nastaví se vám mezi těmito zdroji také Flathub. Ten k dnešnímu dni nabízí zhruba 2000 aplikací ve formátu Flatpak, mezi nimiž naleznete i ty proprietární, které ve Fedoře nejsou k dispozici. Doteď se ale Flathub nastavoval pouze ve filtrované podobě. Dokud si uživatel sám Flathub nepřidal, měl z tohoto zdroje k dispozici jen krátký seznam schválených aplikací. To se změní s Fedorou 38. FESCo schválilo návrh, podle kterého se po povolení zdrojů třetích stran nastaví nefiltrovaný Flathub. Uživatel tak bude mít po zaškrtnutí jedné volby k dispozici stovky dalších aplikací včetně těch populárních jako Steam, VLC, Chrome nebo Spotify. Oficiální repozitáře Fedory ale budou mít i nadále prioritu. To znamená, že když se bude aplikace nacházet jak v repozitářích Fedory, tak na Flathubu, v GNOME Software bude vždy předvolená verze z Fedory.",

And if that's a bit too far away, there's also some good news: a demo goes live on the Nintendo Switch eShop today.\nSea of Stars was first unveiled back in 2020. Though the date has shuffled around a bit since then, the throwback RPG has consistently looked good in showcases and streams. Well, today, you won't have to just watch and wonder. The Switch eShop demo is live now. Plus, August 29 is the new target date.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRwB7RH1lVE\nSabotage made a big splash with The Messenger, a throwback to the action-platformers of old. With Sea of Stars, the team looks back towards the RPG genre instead, while still giving it a polished-throwback style.\nFittingly, Chrono series composer Yasunori Mitsuda is also on deck as a special guest composer alongside Sabotage's Eric W. Brown. And the slice we saw in today's trailer looks absolutely fantastic.\nA new adventure\nThe demo is only out on Nintendo Switch right now, though Sea of Stars is also slated to launch on PC and PlayStation on August 29. No word has been given yet as to what date the other platforms will get the demo, though the game's social media account confirms this demo will be available on other platforms later this year.\nEither way, it's a nice surprise amid a sea of shadow-drops and reveals that hit at today's Nintendo Direct. Though Metroid and Game Boy are all hitting too, I'm definitely setting aside some hard drive space and bandwidth for some Sea of Stars.\nThe post Sea of Stars gets an eShop demo today, locks in for August launch appeared first on Destructoid.",

While usual suspects showed up for the party, we had a few big surprises drop, and many of them Nintendo Switch consoles right now.\nThe show kicked off big with Pikmin 4, spotlighting the new little helpers and a very interesting new camera angle. After locking Pikmin 4 in for July, Nintendo went into more DLC waves for its expansions, third-party reveals, and date confirmations for some previously announced games.\nIt really felt like this show had it all, from the revival of the Advance Wars reboots to several big shadow drops, ranging from demos to a Metroid Prime remaster and Game Boy games on Switch Online.

There’s also a selfie camera for some reason. If you didn’t get the chance to play We Love Katamari back in the day, you’re in for a treat.

The Splatoon 3 Expansion pass has been announced, with the first of two waves is coming in Spring 2023.\nThe first wave has revealed a return of the original Splatoon’s Inkopolis hub area. This includes the shops, with some familiar faces showing up. The Squid Sisters will also perform during Splatfests.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpn0UPPvAb8\nNot much was really shown beyond the hub world. I’d have to think that there’s more to it than just that, however, even though it pokes the nostalgia center of the brain nicely. The tempura dude, Fred Crumbs looks pretty awesome. And delicious.\nThe second wave of the DLC is titled “side order,” but beyond that, we mostly have just a teaser. It shows a town that resembles a bleached reef with an Octoling standing among the whitened buildings.\n\nThe expansion pass should be available to purchase today.

Today, Nintendo is hosting its first Direct of 2023, where we'll get updates on what's in store for its handheld and associated services.\nThe show goes live at 5 p.m. ET / 2 p.m. PT, and you can find the link here and the stream embedded below.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMdUSVSEp7U\nWhat to expect?\nNintendo's 2023 plans are largely a mystery, aside from the looming titan of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. The follow-up to 2017's massive hit Breath of the Wild seems destined to be one of the year's biggest games, though a surprise listing that's since been scrubbed has fans curious about the sequel's price tag.\nPikmin 4 is also due to arrive this year, though we haven't seen anything about that since the original reveal. And Nintendo could always pop open the drawer holding the Advance Wars remake, if the schedule's looking a bit thin.\nAccording to Nintendo, the show will run for roughly 40 minutes and mostly cover Switch games launching in the first half of 2023. Taking a look back at last year's February Direct, which happened around the same time, we can see a similar pattern. The 2022 February Direct revealed Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes for a June date, as well as Mario Strikers: Battle League (also in June) and the Advance Wars reboot (set for April at the time).\nIt was also where the Front Mission remakes first showed up, alongside the Chrono Cross HD remaster and the Live A Live remake. I don't think it'd be a surprise to see some similar third-party partner reveals, alongside whatever Nintendo is cooking up. Plus, there's still some DLC on deck for Nintendo to lock in.\nMy advice, as always, is expect the unexpected and keep those expectations in check. So sit back, crack a cold beverage of your choice, and let's see what this Nintendo Direct has in store for the first half of 2023.\nThe post Let’s watch the first Nintendo Direct of 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

The simple set-up of crime, mystery, and whodunnit makes for a straightforward, tangible objective for players to uncover. Shadows of Doubt squarely falls in the hardboiled detective genre. But like many detectives, it's not without a few factors that set it apart.\nShadows of Doubt, from developer ColePowered Games and publisher Fireshine Games, is pretty ambitious. It's a detective game for sure; the beginning of its Steam Next Fest demo pans over a corporate-owned future dystopia where neon glimmers overhead and where your hardboiled detective avatar decides to take up a new case.

Our original story follows.]\nThere's a Nintendo Direct in store for today, but ahead of the big stream, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom popped up on retail sites last night with a surprising price tag. On some sites, including the Nintendo store, the new Zelda game was listed with a price tag of $69.99.\nAs reported by Nintendolife and others who caught the original store page as it went up, Tears of the Kingdom went live on the Nintendo Store last night with a $69.99 price tag. This listing was eventually taken down, but not before many took notice of the number.\nOther retailers had pre-order pages up for Tears of the Kingdom but have also taken their pages down. It's worth noting that at those retailers, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom was sitting at the standard $59.99 price point.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SNF4M_v7wc\nDisappearing links\nIt's a weird set of circumstances, all happening the night before Nintendo's first big Direct of 2023. Though Tears of the Kingdom hadn't popped onto the Nintendo eShop just yet, it still has its release date set for May 12, 2023.\nMore than likely, we'll get more information about Tears of the Kingdom today, as that launch date is getting closer and closer. Nintendo's Switch games haven't crossed the threshold into $70 territory yet, unlike some other major publishers. Whether we see that line budged over or not, it will certainly be something fans are looking for in today's stream.\nThe Nintendo Direct goes live on YouTube and other channels at 5 p.m. ET / 2 p.m. PT. It's expected to run roughly 40 minutes, and be mostly focused on Nintendo Switch games launching in the first half of 2023.\nThe post Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has a $70 price tag (Update) appeared first on Destructoid.",

I’m not sure, but this Fall, Jackbox games will be dropping The Jackbox Party Pack 10 on our heads. Hopefully, we’ll get a new Fibbage 5 since my family and I can not ever get enough Fibbage, and we’re afraid of trying new things.\nTo commemorate the move into double-digits, Jackbox Games will be spending the next few months sharing details and behind-the-scene looks at the five games that are coming to The Jackbox Party Pack 10. Even better, the team will be looking backward at each of the Party Packs and highlighting one each month leading up to the release of the newest one. These highlights will reveal insight into the development of the series, live streams featuring the developers, and discounts on Steam codes for the highlighted pack through the Jackbox Games Shop.\n[embed]https://youtu.be/Eg4Hl7-5b_s[/embed]\nIf you haven’t played a Jackbox Party Pack, they’re a great way to trick your non-gaming friends into playing something. They’re a staple for my family and me whenever I’m visiting, alongside Mario Kart 8 and Rock Band 4. The downside is that they require a phone, tablet, laptop, or anything else you can access a browser on since they’re used as your secret answer screen.

Players can set up different gates around their real-world accommodations to create a track, then use the car and built-in camera to race around.\nWhile it's all controlled through the game, you're also driving the car. So it's a pretty solid way to both re-imagine your living room, and keep a high-energy cat occupied.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0Q0fYl0pH0\nThe big difference here is that while your car remains the same in the real world, in-game it can morph into different famous Hot Wheels cars. There are mini-games to compete in and stunts to perform, though some of the fun will also be in seeing what that little car can do. I'm not advocating for you to set up any sick jumps or dangerous thrill courses, it's your money. But a childhood spent assembling orange track segments has me thinking about what kind of courses you could concoct for this RC car.\nRallying around the rift\nThere's also a Campaign mode in Hot Wheels: Rift Rally, where different challenge maps and competitions await. Or in Stunt mode, players can drive around without those pesky gates, free to freestyle to their heart's content.\nIt will run you a decent amount for the kit. The standard edition for Hot Wheels: Rift Rally will go for $129.99, while the Collectors Edition adds in a special-edition RC car, extra McLaren Hot Wheels car, and bonus unlockable car for $149.99.\nHot Wheels: Rift Rally races its way onto iOS, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5 on March 14, 2023.\nThe post Hot Wheels: Rift Rally is a new mixed reality racer from Mario Kart Live devs appeared first on Destructoid.",

TMA Games' Waves of Steel is fully assembled and has left early access on Steam.\nForget everything you think you know about naval warfare. There are some bad guys out on the seas, and it’s your job to exterminate them. Waves of Steel has you customize your ideal flagship, then sends you out to rain destruction down on anyone unfortunate enough to be in the water. Billed as “fast and accessible,” you’ll be gunning down enemy ships, planes, submarines, and various boss concoctions in your bid to free the seven seas from oppression in its extensive single-player campaign. The boat jumps, and that’s generally enough for me.\n[embed]https://youtu.be/Dcd5rcoTDeE[/embed]\nI actually really enjoy naval combat when it’s done right. However, even though I wouldn’t consider Waves of Steel as one that’s “done right,” it does its own thing instead and comes out looking just as interesting. I didn’t know I needed an over-the-top fun naval combat game, but now that I’ve seen it, I’m looking forward to trying it out.\nWaves of Steel is now available on PC via Steam.\nThe post Waves of Steel has left the Early Access Drydock appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Nintendo has responded to our inquiries with the following comments.\nOn the reasoning for the $69.99 price tag for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom:\nOn if this is the trend for Nintendo titles going forward:\nOriginal Story (Published at 5:49 pm Central on February 8, 2023)\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom could very well be the most anticipated game of 2023 and is certainly one of the most exciting releases in the history of the Nintendo Switch. During today's Nintendo Direct, we got a new look at gameplay, plus the announcement of the Collector's Edition and a new Amiibo figure starring Link. However, we also got some unfortunate news surrounding the upcoming launch of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.\nIn its press release for the Nintendo Direct, Nintendo announced that the upcoming Zelda entry will retail for $69.99. This makes Nintendo the latest major publish to test the waters of raising the price of its triple-A titles in recent years. This follows other major publishers like 2K Games and PlayStation, who started pricing their major releases at $70 with the start of the new console generation in 2020. Last year, both Xbox and Ubisoft announced that their triple-A games would cost $70 going forward.\nWe reached out to Nintendo for comment regarding the reasoning for the price increase and if this will be the trend for its triple-A releases going forward, but did not immediately receive a response. We will update this story if Nintendo provides a statement.\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom launches on Switch on May 12.",

Like in the original game, we see a human-like lead character crash-landing on a mysterious planet in the trailer, but there’s plenty of new twists to keep things fresh.\nWe see a variety of Pikmin with different abilities, including Ice Pikmin that help to freeze enemies and targets. There’s also a cute dog-like creature that seems to ally with the player to smash through barriers, act as a mount, and other as-yet unrevealed capabilities.\nNintendo also appeared to reveal a release date for Pikmin 4, flashing up the date of July 21, 2023. It’s a good bet that players will be able to have those tiny sentient plant followers trailing behind them on that date when the game arrives on Switch.",

Alongside fellow director Kazunori Kadoi, their team has taken on the lofty task of reinventing the 2005 classic for a modern audience, recapturing the game's magic while also expanding it with new features. During our cover story interview with the two designers, they spoke candidly about the early phases of the game's development, their initial hesitation to tackle such an intimidating project, and how the team's approach in identifying areas for improvement gave them the confidence to see the project through. \nAmpo and Kadoi have plenty of experience working on Resident Evil.

There's no release date for the patch, nor does the message elaborate on the specifics of these improvements. \n“We are committed to making Forspoken the most enjoyable experience possible, and will provide an update about the timing of the next patch as soon as possible,” says Aramaki in the statement, which you can read in full below (click the image to enlarge). \nForspoken earned a 7.5 out of 10 review score from Game Informer, with editor Kyle Hilliard writing, “Forspoken's story and combat fail to reach the heights of its movement and exploration, but thankfully those two latter elements make up most of the experience. I sprinted, often literally, through the campaign in about 15 hours, and now I have a large world filled with nooks and crannies I'm eager to run through and explore. The narrative won’t linger with me, and I avoided combat in the open world often, but I loved making Frey leap and fly through Athia to discover all its treasure chests and secrets.” Check out our full review here.",

          "description": "To many, Cities: Skylines is the premier city-building simulation. When the PC launched in 2015, it quickly became a fan-favorite release for those who felt let down by modern SimCity titles. When the sim title arrived on consoles two years later, the less-intuitive controls didn't detract too much from the experience, enabling it to still deliver a terrific city-building experience. Now, developer Colossal Order and publisher Paradox Interview have announced Cities: Skylines Remastered, which improves the experience for console players in myriad ways.\nThis new version of Cities: Skylines aims to let players create bigger and better metropolises than ever before. In addition to the obvious graphical and performance upgrades enabled by the newer hardware, players can take their city-planning skills to the next level with up to 25 buildable tiles instead the 9 on PS4 and Xbox One versions. Additionally, players can look forward to a quick-selection tool, user-experience improvements like precision placements and updated snapping options, a new environmental control panel, a map editor, and the ability to place structures freely.\nPerhaps most importantly, anyone who owns the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One version and its DLC will receive Cities: Skylines Remastered and DLC (up to the Airports expansion) for free on their respective console family. Those who don't already own the last-gen console version can grab Cities: Skylines Remastered for $40.\nYou can see a very brief teaser rattling off some of the improvements the team made for this new version below.\n\n\nCities: Skylines Remastered arrives on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on February 15. The remastered versions of the DLC will become available in the coming months. For more on Cities: Skylines, read our 2015 review of the PC version here and the 2017 console version here. You can also read our 2021 interview with the CEO of Colossal Order on the enduring success of Cities: Skylines here.",

Set many decades before the Harry Potter stories that unfolded in book and film, the game has a latitude to tell its own story with its own characters that is refreshing – even if there are a healthy smattering of familiar last names like Weasley and Black that are in the mix.

The game first entered early access in 2021 and, like the original, tasks players with taking a dozen heroes through dangerous dungeons. This time though, you’re guiding them on a treacherous caravan ride through five dangerous regions.\nHeroes can bond with or sour on each other via the Affinity System to create combat synergies or dysfunctions. Darkest Dungeon II also boasts a plethora of new upgrades and boons to bolster party members. The demo gives players access to the four starting heroes and two full regions to explore, but progress will not transfer to the full game. \nYou can play Darkest Dungeon II on Steam and the Epic Game Store.

The teaser gave us a glimpse of Cat Mario's appearance in the film, as well as Donkey Kong's reaction. Today, Universal, Illumination, and Nintendo released the official movie poster for the Super Mario Bros. Movie.\nIn this new poster, we get a cinematic glimpse of the cast of main characters that we know of so far, including Mario, Luigi, Peach, Toad, Bowser, Donkey Kong, and Kamek. Additionally, we see the opposing worlds in the apparent conflict of the film, with the darkness of Bowser's Castle contrasted by the bright and joyful Mushroom Kingdom. While nobody quite matches Donkey Kong and Toad's wide-eyed and unbridled bliss, every character on the poster is at least sporting a smirk.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie features an all-star cast, including Chris Pratt as Mario, Charlie Day as Luigi, Anya Taylor-Joy as Peach, Keegan-Michael Key as Toad, Jack Black as Bowser, Seth Rogen as Donkey Kong, and Fred Armisen as Cranky Kong. We also know that Mario's video game voice actor, Charles Martinet, will have a cameo in the film at some point.\nTo this point, the movie has only received character-focused posters on top of a teaser poster that preceded the initial movie trailer. If you missed out on those posters, you can see every other character and teaser poster released for The Super Mario Bros. Movie below.\n\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie arrives in theaters on April 7.

Led by directors Yasuhiro Ampo and Kazunori Kadoi, who now sit at the helm of Resident Evil 4, the game revitalized the 1998 classic, introducded it to a new generation of fans, and paved the way for the RE3 and 4 remakes to come after.

Instead of releasing on March 3, the game now arrives on March 28.\nNaughty Dog wants more time to polish up the PC port, as stated in a message posted to Twitter that you can read in full below (click the image to enlarge). \nThe Last of Us Part I launched for PlayStation 5 last fall and serves as a ground-up remake of the 2013 title. It features improved graphics, reworked controls, improved enemy A.I., and a remade version of the Left Behind DLC chapter. The remake helped usher in the premiere of The Last of Us HBO series last month, which has been heavily watched and received heaps of praise thus far.

Roughly 50 people were on the team working on this game and EA will reportedly attempt to find positions for these employees elsewhere within the company. If positions cannot be found, some might be laid off with severance packages, according to Bloomberg. \n\n\nThe publication says Mohammad Alavi (Titanfall 2, Apex Legends designer) was set to direct this now-canceled game, but he left the company in 2022. \nIt's likely this canceled single-player game set in the Apex Legends and Titanfall universe was the one hinted at back in July in job postings that referred to the game as an \"Apex Universe FPS Incubation Title.\"\nWord of this cancelation comes shortly after EA announced it was shutting down Apex Legends Mobile and Battlefield Mobile, and shuttering the latter's developer, Industrial Toys, as well. Plus, in the same financial results where EA revealed it was shutting these games down, the company revealed that Respawn's upcoming single-player Star Wars game, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, had been delayed to April. \n[Source: Bloomberg]\nDo you think we'll ever get Titanfall 3?

          "description": "Sony's latest financial results covering Quarter 3 of Fiscal Year 2022, which consists of the last three months of the year, reveal the PlayStation 5 had its best quarter on the market yet. \nThe company has surpassed 32 million PS5 units shipped, sitting roughly at 32.1 million, after shipping 7.1 million during the last three months of 2022. It's important to note this isn't a sell-through number so theoretically, there could be consoles sitting on shelves still. But a company ships more units when the demand is there, so it's likely that the majority of these shipped consoles were sold. \nPlayStation did just as well on the first-party software side of things, selling 20.8 million during Q3 of Fiscal Year 2022, which is almost more than double the 11.3 million sold during the same period in 2021. Of those 20.8 million, roughly 11 million were of God of War: Ragnarok, which was the console's big holiday release. \n\n\nIncluding both first and third-party software, 86.5 million units were sold for the PS5, which is less than Q3 of Fiscal Year 2021 (92.7 million) but still an impressive number nonetheless. Sixty-two percent of the software sold this past quarter was digital. \nPlayStation Plus subscribers reached 46.4 million in Q3, which is up from Q2's 45.4 million but down from Q1's 47.3 million. The peak in the PS5's lifetime happened in Q3 of Fiscal Year 2021 at 48 million subscribers.\nIn terms of monthly active PlayStation users, Q3 reached a new peak for the current generation of PlayStation, hitting 112 million. That's up 10 million from the quarter before it and roughly 1 million more than the same quarter in 2021. \nAll told, Q3 of Fiscal Year 2022 was the PS5's best quarter yet. \nDid you pick up a PS5 this holiday season?

Sony didn't provide a reason for why it's closing the collection, but it also clarifies that other PS Plus perks, such as the monthly games, will not be affected. Here’s the full message below:\nThe PlayStation Plus Collection launched alongside the PS5 as an added bonus to those owners. In a way, it served as a mini-version of Xbox's Game Pass, albeit only featuring last-gen titles. The collection has remained largely the same since 2020, with a couple of titles joining the roster and only Persona 5 being removed from the original line-up last year. The PS Plus Collection currently consists of the following titles: \nBatman: Arkham Knight\nBattlefield 1\nBloodborne\nCall of Duty: Black Ops III: Zombie Chronicles Edition\nCrash Bandicoot N.Sane Trilogy\nDays Gone\nDetroit: Become Human\nFallout 4\nFinal Fantasy XV: Royal Edition\nGod of War (2018)\nInfamous: Second Son\nThe Last Guardian\nThe Last of Us Remastered\nMonster Hunter: World\nMortal Kombat X\nRatchet & Clank (2016)\nResident Evil VII: Biohazard\nUncharted 4: A Thief's End\nUntil Dawn\nLast year, Sony added two premium PlayStation Plus Subscription tiers that give those members access to a much larger (and more regularly updated) library of games across multiple generations of PlayStation. Premium members can access most, though not all, of these titles now, so perhaps Sony wants to incentivize standard PS Plus subscribers to upgrade. Regardless, be sure to nab these games now if you haven't already before the May 9 deadline sneaks up on you.",

Set during World War 1, players control a French soldier who gets separated from his comrades and trapped inside a military bunker. Within this labyrinthine, trap-laden sanctuary lurks a deadly creature that stalks the player, who must use their resourcefulness to survive. If you’re a fan of Alien: Isolation, The Bunker appears to aim for a similar style with a heaping dose of its signature mind-bending scares. Check out the original reveal trailer below.\n\n\nYou can check out Amnesia: The Bunker on Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.",

It is for this reason, after months of working with our development partner, that we have made the mutual decision to sunset our mobile game. Although disappointing, we are proud of the game we launched, are grateful for the support of the Apex Legends community, and are confident that this is the right decision for players.\" \nAll real-world money, in-app purchases have been disabled and the game has been removed from webstores. From now until the game's shutdown on May 1, players can spend their existing Syndicate Gold and continue playing the full game.

          "description": "A few months have passed since we released ScummVM 2.6.1. It's time to prepare for a new release!\nOur lovely developers added support, yet again, for a bunch of new ancient games that require testing:\nSoldier Boyz\nGLK Scott Adams Interactive Fiction games (C64 and ZX Spectrum)\nGLK Scott Adams adventures 1-12 (TI99/4A format)\nObsidian\nPink Panther: Passport to Peril\nPink Panther: Hokus Pokus Pink\nDriller/Space Station Oblivion\nHalls of the Dead: Faery Tale Adventure II\nBesides these games, we’d appreciate it if you could check our release testing list. Maybe you’ll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long - otherwise, there are some demos of these games available on our website.\nAnd since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we’ve seen notable changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.\nAs usual, we are not just adding support for new games. We are constantly working on improving the engines we already support and, in particular, we’ve seen some incredible work being done on the SCUMM engine. Yes, there are the usual bug fixes, but this time we are also adding a feature that helps playing the SCUMM games in a truly original fashion: Support for the original loading and saving dialogs within the GUI!\nSpeaking of truly original: Remember those old CRT displays we had back in the day? With ScummVM 2.7.0 you’ll be able to replicate this experience on certain platforms thanks to our new shader-based scalers. Go ahead and give it a try!\nAll testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.\nA detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.\nThank you very much for your support! Let’s make ScummVM 2.7.0 a great release - together!\n>",

Depending on your perspective, we’re either two months early for our usual April 1st release, or a bit tardy for the Christmas 2022 release we intended. We think the wait has been worth it. This is one of the largest releases we’ve done in several years, with numerous features and improvements covering the user interface, gameplay features, and modding extensions for NewGRF and Game Script creators. Some of the highlights are: Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. This includes better automatic scaling when using HiDPI or mixed DPI setups. Direct access to NewGRF/AI/GS settings from the new game window. Various small tweaks and improvements to several windows. NewGRFs can now provide engine variants that are shown hierarchically in the purchase list. Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. Custom league tables for GameScripts. More natural rivers which get wider as they flow downstream. And much more, which can be seen in the changelog or the previous release announcements! In addition to these features and improvements, we’ve fixed lots of bugs. (If you played with the RC2 testing release, most were fixed before then. See the changelog for full details.)
