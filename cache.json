          "description": "Breaking hearts and minds.\nBreak-ups suck. There are no two ways about it. You spend so much time feeling confused, desperate to make things work, and even a little trapped. That’s kind of what it’s like to play Maquette. Annapurna’s latest release (developed by newbie Graceful Decay) uses puzzles to tell the story of a relationship breakdown. Initially released on PlayStation and PC in 2021, it now brings its pretty puzzles to the Switch.\nThe game takes place in a sequence of fantasy worlds that meld Disneyland-esque castles with Tuscan gardens, carnivals, and beaches. Each world comes with mind-bending challenges and the layers of a relationship story at its heart. The title ‘Maquette’ describes a scale model on which a sculptor bases their final art piece. It refers to the game’s landscape-within-a-landscape, and it’s also a nod to the two main characters’ love of art.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Back from the dead.\nOne of the unfortunate casualties of the end of DS and 3DS eras was the death of games that were uniquely suited to the quirky dual-screened devices. The Etrian Odyssey series, the first three games of which are represented in the new Etrian Odyssey Origins Collection (also available separately) was a good example of this bespoke design, as you were presented with dungeon-crawling RPG adventures that required you to actively make maps using their stylus on the touch screen. So, how do these games play now on the Switch, a console that they clearly were designed made for? Pretty well, believe it or not! Though we would have liked Atlus to give these games a little more love for this re-release, all three games in the Etrian Odyssey Origins Collection hold up quite well today.\nIn a rare subversion of typical RPG tropes, the story in each of these games is something that mostly takes a backseat. None of your characters individually ‘exist’ in the plot because each of them is custom-made and named by you, so the narratives mostly deal with broad ideas that could fit any party and character type. For example, the second game is about a legendary treasure held within a flying sky castle that can only be reached by entering the Yggdrasil labyrinth, while the third game is about a highly advanced city that sank into the ocean which can also only be accessed by delving into another maze. These games hardly feature dynamic plots packed with all kinds of twists and interesting characters, just basic premises and a whole lot of dungeon-crawling.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

I can't recall any other time an episodic adventure game has received GOTY-level praise before it was even concluded, let alone only 40% done.\nEpisodes three through five arrived sporadically: in spring 2014, summer 2016, and — after what must have been an agonising hiatus — the start of 2020. Having bypassed this wait to play the game for the first time only recently, I feel wistfully as though I'll never share quite the same fond feelings for it as contemporary fans (like our own reviews ranger Rachel, who recently named KRZ one of her all-time favourite indie games). But I'm also quite relieved that I didn't have to exercise that kind of patience. I mean, I'm very good at neglecting to carry on with games for years at a time despite thoroughly enjoying what I've played so far. But I like doing it on my terms, you know?\nI initially attempted to do something a bit clever with this retrospective. I wanted to play the first two episodes that earned KRZ our GOTY nod in 2013, and write up on them as a discrete entity as far as possible. Only then did I plan to carry on the game and add some follow-up impressions, perhaps assessing whether I thought RPS would still award the big chocolate medal to the full game as it finally came to be in 2020. But, after sitting with my feelings about Episodes 1-2 for a couple of weeks, any intelligent observations I might have made were drowned out by an increasingly loud, insistent voice in the back of my head howling: \"I WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS.\" Actually, that might be a good impression to just let stand on its own merits.\n Read more",

All proceeds are split between the participating developers, and there’s some very cool stuff included. \r\n\n\r\n“Purchasing the Queer Games Bundle is a direct action that you can take right now to support queer people in a life-changing way,” reads the bundle's description, “and in exchange, you get over 450 amazing, heartfelt, fun, and radical games and artworks.”\r\n\n \nRead more",

Personally I know, sure as eggs is eggs, that I would absolutely go to pieces. I'm not hitting the end credits of The Tartarus Key in real life, but fortunately, it's a nails thriller puzzle game that fuses PS1-style retro graphics with Saw-esque murder traps. Plus, you know, it's only about six hours end to end, which isn't bad for a semi-magical kidnap plot.\nIn this situation I am not me, of course, but Alex Young, and Alex upon escaping a locked study (an easy warm-up puzzle involving postcards) she finds and frees Torres, an ex-cop turned private detective, who sets up a base of operations around the mysterious mansions main fireplace. From there game's rhythm is clearing the different wings of the house by completing increasingly difficult puzzle rooms, each eventually culminating in finding a new person to save from a new death trap - concocting the antidote for poison or following the instructions to get through an electrocuted floor maze.\nIt's an odd group, but if you rescue everyone you start to see the edges of a wider story. There's a nice layering of paranoia, because most of the puzzles have an element of, for want of a better word, magic to them. One of the very first sees you tasked with getting an academic out of a living flesh-blob, and failure results in it and him vanishing into nowhere. You also find an underground lab with notes on scientific experiments, and a holding cell slash testing chamber - but given that next door is a giant meat freezer sokoban, is it not the case that the lab is just another puzzle room set? The low-poly, low-draw distance style of everything really adds to this, and you keep suspecting that some new puzzle or trap or maybe a weird murderer is going to suddenly loom out of the darkness in front of you. It's the kind of head melting I haven't had since playing Old Gods Rising.\n Read more",

          "description": "One of my absolute favourite elements of Citizen Sleeper is how you essentially play as a nobody. When we first meet the Sleeper they've had their memories completely erased; the last thing they remember is stuffing themselves into a cargo container and shooting off into the depths of space - a last resort in wanting to escape the clutches of a scary corporation. They now find themselves on a dishevelled space station called Erlin's Eye, desperate and alone. They're essentially an empty shell, and one which you can etch your own story onto.\nBut it’s not their lack of personal identity that makes the Sleeper a nobody (after all, you essentially forge an identity for them as you make decisions throughout the game). It’s the realisation that, in this vast universe that developer Gareth Damian Martin has written, you’re no one. A single grain of sand in a vast desert. No one knows who you are, no one cares about you, and you’re stuck on a lawless space station, helpless, scared, and dying.\nRead more",

Instead, it was asked of Stephen Kick - at the time, a recently unemployed videogame artist holidaying in a Guatemalan hostel. Up until that point, Kick had dedicated his life to creative pursuits. He had no business background, and none of the acumen required to understand contracts or negotiate licensing fees. More to the point, he had no more than $5,000 to his name. Hardly the foundation for a follow-up to two of the most acclaimed PC games of all time.\r\n\n \nRead more",

In other words, the 2015 System Shock: Enhanced Edition, also by Nightdive, and the original. Well, System Shock Classic, which is basically the original except it runs on my PC.\nRead more",

For the uninitiated, Diablo forms one of the jewels in Blizzard's crown (maybe a smaller one, just offset to the Warfcraft centre stone), an action-RPG series that's like if the kind of 90s metal album cover that has a skeleton on it asked to be turned into a game where you explode many hundreds of near-identical monsters to get incrementally better loot. This is a spoiler-free review of the latest greatest addition, following 2012's Diablo III, but a Diablo game's story is sort of unspoilable, both because a) paying attention to it is of passing importance to playing, and b) the plot of them is always basically the same anyway.\nTo wit: Sanctuary, a high-fantasy world with a low-fantasy vibe, where so much as going to the next town over will be a brush with some horrible little goblin rat called a Flesh Thresher, was created as a respite from the eternal battle between heaven and hell. After X number of years of relative peace, one (or many) of the Lords Of Hell is doin' some bad stuff. Usually Diablo, I'll grant you. In this case it's Lilith, a kind of Dante's Lady Dimetrescu, who's making people horny for being stepped on power. Diablo games have always had a Grand Canyon sized gulf between the cinematics (epic; luscious; brutal) and the game in practise (clicking). IV is no different. And you know. It's fine.\nRead more",

          "description": "For a certain sort of PC gaming fan, System Shock is where it all began. 30 years of immersive sim development started here, as Looking Glass escaped the restraints of the RPG genre and embraced thoughtful first-person action. SHODAN broke free, and the world was never the same. Without System Shock, there would be no Thief or Gloomwood, no Prey or Dead Space. Bioshock was conceived as its sequel. The creative figureheads behind Deus Ex and Dishonored were wrapped up in its creation, and forever changed by contact with Looking Glass and its unique philosophy.\nCountless studios have used Citadel Station as a star to steer by, measuring their own work against System Shock’s commitment to simulation, dense atmosphere, and method-ish refusal to break character. This was not so much a game as an alternate reality. As one of our interviewees tells us: “We were trying to build the holodeck.”\nHere’s the story of how it was made, as told by the people who made it.\nRead more",

          "description": "Back in February 1991, Capcom released Street Fighter 2 to arcades. Unbeknownst to Capcom at the time, Street Fighter 2’s massive success would cause it to become the blueprint for fighting games - a genre the game effectively created upon its release. This blueprint proved to be so influential that even some of Street Fighter 2’s most underwhelming elements are still being parroted in fighting games today. As a result, more than 30 years later, one constant in the fighting game genre has always remained true: the story mode is gonna suck.\nThere have been some valiant attempts at rectifying this in the last decade, but the core issue has always remained the same; fighting games are inherently designed to be played against other people, and back-to-back fights with AI controlled characters will never be able to properly match the competition of the real thing. Yet, with Street Fighter 6, Capcom have seemingly done the impossible. Street Fighter 6 has the best story mode in any fighting game I’ve played. Admittedly a low bar, but still, Capcom could have easily half-assed the story mode, just as so many other fighting games still choose to do, and still have been widely praised based solely on the strength of its multiplayer. Instead, Capcom are offering fighting game developers a new blueprint to copy - one that prioritises teaching new players above everything else.\nRead more",

          "description": "When my Sleeper escaped their ramshackle life on the fringes of Erlin's Eye at the end of last year, they left behind a lot of unfinished business. I had to stop short my efforts to help Bliss make a go of her repair bay business, and Tala was left to finish making her brand-new distillery on her own. Yatagan agent Rabiyah probably has my name on an employment blacklist, too, after I upped sticks without telling them, and the spores of mushroom algae I'd been cultivating for Riko over in Greenway were no doubt left to rot and moulder somewhere. Instead, I jacked that all in to smuggle myself, my engineering pal Lem and his tiny daughter Mina onto a ship headed for some far-flung star out in the void. The Sidereal ship wasn't going to wait. It was now or never.\nFortunately hitting an ending in Citizen Sleeper doesn't mean the end of your save. Booting it back up again for this month's RPS Game Club, I wanted to play out a different ending to my Sleeper's story. Turning my back on Lem and Mina still brought its own kind of sadness, admittedly, but I wanted to dig into the game's trio of free DLC episodes first and foremost, as that was another thing I never got time to start last year. I've only played through the first chapter, Flux, so far, but man alive, it was not an auspicious start for the refugee flotilla ship hoping to make a new life for themselves here. In fact, I don't think it could have gone any worse, such was the monumental failure of my collective dice rolls and decision making. But despite absolutely beefing it in Flux, I also came to realise an important lesson. It's okay to fail, and that failure can often make the consequences of your actions feel all the more poignant. Sure, it might not feel nice, and yes, I wish it could have gone better. But sometimes the odds really are stacked against you, and you've just got to roll with it.\nRead more",

          "description": "Most video games are too big. Their lands are too expansive, their histories over-explained, their playtimes too long. Most of everything is too long (songs, books, movies, everything) but it's especially felt in games, where the magical \"What's next?\" feeling of discovering a world often fades to leave the \"What task must I complete now?\" drudgery of playing a video game. So I hugely admire Cosmo D's Off-Peak series, which has built the feeling of a huge and fascinating city through only four tiny locations visited across four games with a combined playtime of under eight hours.\nRead more",

It is absolutely comparable to Obsidian's garden adventure, but a peer rather than a pretender.

Between the soulless platforming, undercooked stealth, tedious storytelling, and framerate stuttering so bad it’s got me killed twice, Gollum is perilously short on likeable qualities. Especially if you’re not into LOTR lore, or fine hattery.\nIn my unclad head, then, Gollum’s highlight so far has been DLSS 3. It’s one of just a few dozen games to support the newest, most artificially intelligent version of Nvidia’s deep learning-powered upscaler, and frankly makes a very compelling argument for switching it on.

          "description": "Well then. Mere minutes after Nvidia hit the launch button on the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti, AMD rocked up with a new 1080p graphics card of their own: the Radeon RX 7600. Though it’s likely more of an RTX 4060 rival, given the RX 7600 will go on sale tomorrow – May 25th – at £260 / $269, slightly less than the $299-tagged 4060.\nBased on the same RDNA 3 architecture as the Radeon RX 7900 XT and RX 7900 XTX, the RX 7600 nonetheless targets a much more widely-used monitor resolution than those 4K-minded GPU hulks. Which makes a nice change, and means AMD will beat Nvidia’s RTX 40 series to the punch on a sub-£300 GPU, with the RTX 4060 not set for release until July.\nRead more",

As you might remember from the first Alan Wake, you could get an achievement for finding the hidden thermos bottles littered throughout the game.\n\"In the sequel, the thermos plays a significantly more important role,\" Remedy communications director Thomas Puha said in a press release. \"This got us excited about the idea of creating an authentic Oh Deer Diner thermos for our fans.\"\nThe collaboration is between two Finnish companies, Remedy and Airam. It's a 0.45 liter bottle with a glass interior. Perfect for that cup of coffee you might want to enjoy while booting up a scary experience in the fall.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOWxNAd3sg4\nAlso, enjoy the reveal trailer above, featuring a special guest appearance from a Control character you might recognize.\nOh, deer\nAs I said above, video game merch is tricky. For me personally, I don't like stuff that's a bit too loud or just a giant logo. Something a bit more subtle, that feels like a representation of that game world rather than an advertisement for it, is my jam.\nSo with that in mind, even though I've only played a little bit of the first Alan Wake, I dig this thermos. It's sleek and looks well-made. It's a subtle nod, one that might get you an \"ah\" from friends who've played the game, without looking like a billboard.\nBasically, I wish more merch was like this. Fewer over-logo'd T-shirts, more useful items with smart in-game ties.\nThe post Remedy has a limited edition Alan Wake thermos on the way appeared first on Destructoid.",

Discovering that first zombie eating away at a dead body is definitely up there when it comes to the most iconic moments in gaming history. The rest of the game, despite—and sometimes due to—some pretty C-tier writing and voice acting, also left a mark.\nWhile there were plenty of zombie games before Chris Redfield stepped foot into the Spencer Mansion, Resident Evil changed the industry and ushered in a resurgence of the genre across all forms of media. Movies like Shaun of the Dead and 28 Days Later carried on the concepts pioneered by George Romero for a new generation, while properties like Left 4 Dead and The Walking Dead propelled zombie media to pop culture mainstay status.\nNo matter how ma…",

There are plenty of bad movies intentionally made to be fun to watch. Digital marketplaces are full of bad games made badly and good games made poorly, but creating a game that is intended to reflect bad design but is actually fun to play; that takes work.\nHowever, with the emerging sub-genre that I like to call jank-pop, there have been better examples of it. Cruelty Squad, for example, features eye-piercingly garish colors and spaghetti-nest level design, but it winds up being fun to play with its dark but off-kilter sense of humor and deep (sometimes unintentionally broken) mechanics.\nSome people take Cruelty Squad way too seriously.

You manage the weight and integrity of your airship, expand your facilities, and search for new technologies and resources.\nhttps://youtu.be/aMuE0W8XfC4\nThe developers state that “The Early Access version will offer plenty of mechanics and activities to play within a vast world ready to be explored, all of which will engage players for many hours.” They go on to clarify that the amount of hours is roughly 30. The developers also note that they plan to include co-op in Forever Skies later in Early Access.\nDid you ever play Guns of Icarus Online? It was (and, I guess, still is) a great airship game where you and your friends battle against opposing crews. Players would typically take the role of either a gunner, pilot, or engineer. I personally liked being an engineer, and jumping between the various components of the ship and keeping them in tip-top shape and not on fire.\nFor that matter, my favorite part of Subnautica was exploring the ocean while personalizing my big submarine.\nWhat I’m saying is that Forever Skies seems like my jam, and I’m looking forward to it.\nForever Skies hits PC via Steam Early Access on June 22, 2023.

While the release was praised for its quality gameplay and usage of the Marvel license, this, unfortunately, did not equate to sales, with the game being considered an unsuccessful commercial release by parent company Take-Two Interactive. Much like another comic-book release, Marvel's Avengers, Midnight Suns was a title that was designed to have a relatively long life in the gaming market.\nThe layoffs at Firaxis continue a miserable trend of cuts across the entire industry. Since January, roles have been lost at various high-profile developers and publishers including Microsoft, Riot Games, Sega, Twitch, and Ubisoft. Just last month, it was announced that Cyberpunk 2077 developer CD Projekt RED had also laid off members of studio The Molasses Flood, following a restart of the upcoming Witcher spin-off Project Sirius.\nFiraxis is latest video game studio hit by layoffs [Axios Gaming]\nThe post Marvel’s Midnight Suns developer Firaxis hit by layoffs in ‘sharpening of focus’ appeared first on Destructoid.",

It’s been a record year for anti-LGBTQ+ legislation, which is immensely depressing.\nSo, for this very important Pride Month, the itch.io Queer Games Bundle returns with the goal of providing some much-needed funds to LGBTQ+ creators who would often be otherwise overlooked. These are people who just want to make or supplement a living making games, art, and other content, and the bundle gives them some money to do just that.\nThe Queer Games Bundle describes itself as “A bundle of over 450 games, software, and zines from nearly 300 queer artists across itch.io.” A glance over its immense contents shows everything from more mainstream titles like Raptor Boyfriend: A High School Romance to emotionally charged art games like He Fucked the Girl Out of Me.\nThe hosts of the bundle are suggesting a $60 all-in price tag, but you can pay what you want so long as it’s over $10. Proceeds go to developers who opted-in to get some of the funding.\nNote that there is a wide range of topics covered in these games, books, zines, and tabletops, including some decidedly 18+ things. While wading into uncomfortable territory can nurture empathy and an understanding in your fellow humans, your priority should always be to be kind to yourself, so watch what you load up.\nSo, if you’d like a massive buffet of delicious queer art content to dig into or would just like to support the community of queer creators, take a look at the Queer Games Bundle over on itch.io.

Set in the year 2090, the narrative concerns a brutal conflict between the Oceania Cooperative Union (O.C.U.) and the Unified Continental States (U.C.S.) — a conflict fought with devastating mech units known as \"Wanzers\".

          "description": "It'll have cross-play and cross-save\nThanks to a series of Apple-related tweets from Hello Games' Sean Murray, many have speculated that No Man's Sky was coming to Mac. Now, that dream has become a reality, as it transpires that the universe exploration game has now become available for the Windows alternative.\nThe news comes from the man himself on Twitter, announcing the Mac version via a promotional video. Along with the teaser, here's an overview of what No Man's Sky fans will be treated to in this port. Namely, the space-faring title will have cross-play and cross-save, all the updates that have occurred over the last seven years, and more. Best of all, it's completely free to those who own the game on Steam.\nhttps://twitter.com/NoMansSky/status/1664257765349498880\nMurray also tweeted another little nugget of information, which shows that the Mac version also supports VR. According to a report from Eurogamer, the game will run on any Mac that uses Apple Silicon. Therefore, the Mac Mini, Mac Studio, MacBook Air, and MacBook Pro should be suitable. The requirements on Steam say you will need an Intel i5 processor and at least an AMD Radeon Pro 570X @ 4 GB, as well as macOS Monterey 12.3.\nOnce considered one of the most tumultuous video game launches ever, those who abandoned No Man's Sky would be forgiven for assuming things hadn't moved on. However, you couldn't be further from the truth. With a series of free updates that have significantly improved the experience while also delivering new content, Hello Games has really turned the tide. It even won a BAFTA in 2022 for \"Best Evolving Game.\" That's certainly a different story when compared to how things were in 2016.\nThe post No Man’s Sky is coming to Mac, creator announces appeared first on Destructoid.",

Yes, there are stats to build and monsters to fight, but the latter is a small part of the final package, while the former is achieved through completing a small number of tasks each in-game day. It’s better to think of Loop8 as a social simulator rather than an RPG.

Mere hours later, my wife and I bought the season pass. That's a good sign! The second DLC of that pass (Escape from the Past) is due out on June 19, according to Coin Crew Games. It's priced at $9.99 piecemeal or as part of the aforementioned $14.99 pass.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqPHLGlUzHM&t=1s\n \nHere's a quick blurb on the conceit of the DLC:\n\"Step into the past for Escape Academy’s second Expansion Pack, joining old friends and Academy students Sandra Solange and Eel Barnes on a mission to unmask a villain who wants their Headmaster dead. After an 'accident' at an Academy sport event, Sandra and Eel are tasked with investigating each of the suspected faculty members to deduce who the killer is and save the school.\"\n\nThere's an announcement trailer you can check out above, but we don't recommend watching it!

          "description": "Plus a Trek to Yomi\nThe PlayStation Plus monthly game lineup for June 2023 is out, and it's got a strange mix of titles. Sports fans, archaeologists, and sword aficionados will all have something to look forward to in June, at the least.\nFor June 2023 PlayStation Plus is getting NBA 2K23, the most recent entry in the basketball series, for PlayStation 4 and PS5. Reviews on this particular entry seem medium-warm, though I'll admit, I haven't played some virtual hoops in quite a while. My go-to is NBA Street, personally. But if you want to play the modern-day, professional basketball, this a cheap way to try it out.\nOtherwise, if you're a bit more keen on dinosaurs, Jurassic World Evolution 2 is also on this month's docket. These dinos (probably) can't play basketball, but they can cause havoc for you and your parkgoers. Ever think you could run Jurassic Park and have it not turn into a terrifying mess? Well, this is your shot.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g76Zx7zydXQ\nIf you just want a cinematically inclined, action-driven story about a swordsman, Trek to Yomi can cover that. Following Hiroki, a blademaster who fails in his vow to protect the people he cares for, you can expect a lot of slicing and dicing in this 2D action-adventure game.\nOf course, a new month means we see some old games depart. If they look appealing, make sure to get them before they're gone. Here's everything coming and going on the PlayStation Plus monthly lineup in June 2023. You've got until June 6 to lock them onto your account.\nComing to PlayStation Plus monthly games in June 2023\nNBA 2K23 (PS4, Ps5)\nJurassic World Evolution 2 (PS4, PS5)\nTrek to Yomi (PS4, PS5)\nLeaving the PlayStation Plus monthly games on June 6\nGRID Legends\nChivalry 2\nDescenders\nThe post June PlayStation Plus lineup includes includes basketball and dinosaurs appeared first on Destructoid.",

The Japanese studio, known for both its support work on Nintendo games as well as its own games, such as Dillon's Rolling Western, has announced it is shutting down.\nThe news was posted on the studio's official site, saying the team has decided to disband. No overt reason was given, but the studio does express gratitude for its fans.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNUer6t0bl4\nVanpool was one of the studios started by former Love-de-Lic developers, alongside studios like Punchline (Chulip, Rule of Rose) and Skip Ltd. (Chibi-Robo!, LOL).\nBack in 2001, Vanpool released its first game with Endonesia on the PS2. From there on, it made some fun, unique games; Dillon's Rolling Western, for one. And there's also the bizarre, memorable Freshly-Picked Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland.\nA slight tingle\nAlongside its own games, Vanpool also supported several Nintendo titles. The Kirby series (including Forgotten Land and the recently released Return to Dream Land Deluxe) dots Vanpool's resume. The studio also contributed to Paper Mario: Sticker Star and Chibi-Robo! Zip Lash.\nIt's a shame to see a studio like this go. It's hard not to think of Alphadream, or the curiously quiet Skip Ltd. mentioned before, too. These studios, and their history, represent a different kind of games than we usually see. And it's a team that played a role in Nintendo's recent success with Kirby, too.\nHopefully, everyone involved lands somewhere new.\nThe post Dillon’s Rolling Western studio Vanpool is shutting down appeared first on Destructoid.",

What did I just say?\nI really enjoyed Hot Wheels Unleashed when I reviewed it back in 2021. I didn’t expect a sequel so soon, so I’m glad I don’t have to wait long to get my hands on it. Even though the trailer and screenshots show us nothing, they do seem to demonstrate some concepts the new game will go for.\nTo start with, there will be bikes. There also seems to be a sort of mid-air jump mechanic. It looks like there’s going to be off-roading, as well. My favorite part of any toy car game is driving through a big world, so I’m actually liking what I’m seeing. I guess I’ll have to wait to see if the actual gameplay reflects this.\nWe do know that the track editor is back, there will be over 130 cars to unlock and choose from, and the main campaign will be story-driven. Sounds weird.

At the end of the demo, your PC is graded out of 100 on its ability to run the new fighter at varying settings levels. If you so wish, you can fine-tune the settings and then run the tool again.\n\nIt should also be noted that there is a demo already available on Steam, which will give you an equally good impression of how to set your PC for Street Fighter 6. Both of these options should provide you with a relatively accurate estimation of the optimal settings for your rig.

          "description": "Getcha Bimmy on\nAs if our knuckles weren't already red 'n' raw from the past two years of street-scrollin' smackers, Modus Games has announced that grandaddy brawler Double Dragon will be making its grand return in July, in the form of the previously announced Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons.\nDeveloped by studio Secret Base, Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons offers a new twist on the classic side-scrolling franchise, incorporating a permanent tag-team mechanic, a roster of new and returning heroes and villains, and even challenging roguelike elements. Billy Lee, Jimmy Lee, Marian and others will once again be doling out vigilante justice to the warriors of the night. Cleaning out the New York City of 199x as only they know how: At the business end of a back elbow > headbutt combo.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_c0ff_uZQrY\nSporting a dynamic mission function, Double Dragon Gaiden will task the player with clearing out multiple sectors of the city, taking down gang bosses, and leveling up their squad of scrappers. Earn cash through extended combos and successive battles, before spending those hard-fought gains on upgrades and power-ups for your team. And should you fall in battle, simply regroup, restrategize, and return to the fight, a little stronger, a little wiser, and a little more determined.\nIt's interesting to see Secret Base adapt the Double Dragon formula in a semi-roguelike capacity, offering new twists on one of the beat-'em-up genre's pioneer titles. And we won't have to wait all that long to find out how well these interesting mechanics synergize. Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons launching July 27 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.\nThe post Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons hits the streets in July appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "There's a curious job opening at MachineGames\nFor all you B.J. Blazkowicz fans out there, it's possible that Wolfenstein 3 could currently be in development. While Cyberpilot and Youngblood came out in 2019, the last mainline entry in the revitalized series was back in 2017. Since then, many of you have wanted to see more exploits from the Nazi-killing protagonist.\nThe existence of a new job opening comes from Reddit user Hard2DaC0re, who points to a new vacancy posted by developer MachineGames. The studio has been responsible for the modern wave of Wolfenstein games, so the fact that the company is advertising a new position suggests something is on the horizon (indeed, the MachineGames website shows a number of job openings). The senior animator listing specifically states that applicants must be familiar with the developer's prior releases.\nIs B.J. back?\nhttps://youtu.be/bkrwUzWeACg\nIt's still early days to say for certain if Wolfenstein is poised for an immediate comeback. At the time of writing, there's been no confirmation from official parties about whether Wolfenstein 3 is currently in the works. We already know that MachineGames is making an Indiana Jones game. These new positions could be related to that project. But it's really just a matter of when in terms of Wolfenstein's triumphant return.\nWhile 2019's Youngblood wasn't as well received, it was still a welcome continuation of the rebooted series. Plus, it's nice to see id Software's iconic FPS franchise is still finding a home in the modern gaming world. Things have certainly changed a lot over the decades, but it seems what hasn't changed is people's desire to take on the Third Reich.\nJust to reiterate, the rumors about a new Wolfenstein game being in development are just that. For now, it's best to hold off any excitement, but hopefully, there'll be some official news to gorge on at some point.\nThe post Wolfenstein 3 could be in development, according to a new job listing appeared first on Destructoid.",

Prosecutors also demanded that Naka pay a fine of 2.5 million yen (roughly $17,900) as well as a supplementary penalty of 170 million yen (roughly $1.2 million). Naka's defense asked that this fine and prison sentence be reduced, but a final decision on the matter isn't expected until July 7, VGC reports. \nNaka, who also directed Balan Wonderworld, was arrested in November in connection to an insider trading investigation involving the reveal of a new Dragon Quest game. Naka was accused of purchasing 10,000 shares worth 2.8 million yen (roughly $20,000) in Aiming, the company behind the new mobile Dragon Quest game. \nThen, less than a month later, Naka was re-arrested on a second charge of insider trading, this time involving the now-defunct mobile battle royale, Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier. Naka reportedly purchased 120,000 shares in Ateam, the developer behind the game, for approximately 144.7 million yen (more than $1 million). \nNow, Naka has been charged and could face more than two and a half years in prison alongside more than $1 million in fines.

          "description": "For a licensed racing game, 2021’s Hot Wheels Unleashed was a fun and respectable debut, and now we’ll get to see how developer Milestone builds on that foundation with an upcoming sequel. \nHot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged arrives on October 19 and retains the fun “little toy car in a big world” presentation with new additions under the hood. Players can now get behind the wheel of motorcycles and ATVs, and the game has over 130 vehicles total at launch.\nPlayers race across five diverse environments using new skills: double jumping and lateral dashing. The double jump can be performed at any time to leap over rivals and obstacles, while dashing is great for sideswiping nearby opponents or dodging hazards. Milestone touts increased interactivity between vehicles and objects on and off the track, and playstyles can be customized using perks earned by earning skill points. \n\n\nModes include a revamped story-driven campaign starring four original characters, complete with animated cutscenes. Other challenges include events designed to test players’ skills such as drifting and evading crashes. For online multiplayer, the game supports cross-play (except on Switch), and players can now create friend parties. Local two-player splitscreen also makes a return. \nThe popular creation suite from the first game now features a refined Track Editor with expanded features and a Livery Editor update introducing the Sticker Editor to create and save custom patterns and shapes. Best of all, all user-generated content will be sharable cross-platform at launch, though it's unclear if any player-made content from the original can be imported into this game. \nHot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. Check out some of the sequel's cars in the screenshot gallery below.",

It seems one might be on the way. \nAccording to a new report on Sudbury.com, a news organization that covers the Greater Sudbury area in Canada, which is where Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City was filmed, Sudbury is receiving an $11 million injection from the provincial government, as reported by PCGamesN. This government is funding 20 local projects through the Northern Ontario Heritage Fund Corporation and while a sequel to Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City hasn't officially been named as one of those 20 projects, there is one called \"Umbrella Chronicles,\" and it's receiving $2 million. \nIf you're familiar with the Resident Evil series, you know \"Umbrella Chronicles\" is likely a nod to The Umbrella Chronicles spinoff game. Add in that the film company behind \"Umbrella Chronicles\" is Raccoon HG Film Productions, the same company behind Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City, and the picture gets a little clearer: we might be getting a sequel. \nIt's important to note this isn't an official confirmation of a sequel. Perhaps Raccoon HG Film Productions is making a different Resident Evil movie unattached to Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City. Only time will tell. \nIn the meantime, watch our interview with two of the 2021 film's stars and then check out this featurette from Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City with some behind-the-scenes details. \n[Source: Sudbury.com via PCGamesN]\nDo you want a sequel to Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City?

Today, Genvid broke its silence by not only giving us new details on the series but also a trailer.\nIn this series, which will unfold simultaneously across the globe, those watching can help decide the fates of Ascension's main characters. This means that as the story plays out, the audience will have a say in who survives the surely horrific story, who will be redeemed or damned by their actions, and who will suffer the almost certainly ghastly consequences. According to Genvid Entertainment, not even the developers will know the results of the story until it unfolds.\nSilent Hill: Ascension features an ensemble of new characters, monsters, and locations within the Silent Hill universe. Genvid has crafted a real-time interactive system that allows viewers from around the world to decide these characters' fates within the narrative the studio has crafted. Beginning later in 2023, fans can tune in to live story moments where each day is different based on audience interactions. \nSilent Hill: Ascension is set to stream later this year.

          "description": "Final Fantasy XVI’s combat is fast, chaotic, and, most importantly, fun. There are plenty of combos to pull off, and in just the small taste of the action during my cover story trip to Square Enix’s Tokyo, Japan, office, I saw so much variance in setting up Clive’s combative abilities that I can’t wait to see what others do in-game. \nI also watched combat director Ryota Suzuki play through some of the most challenging encounters in the game, and unsurprisingly, he excelled, taking maybe one or two hits in the 20 minutes he played. He used combos I didn’t really comprehend – admittedly, he was playing at a much later portion of the game than I had hands-on access with – and it got me thinking: is he excited to see what players do with FFXVI’s combat, much like I was sitting there watching him pull off intricate combos against myriad enemies? \n“I’ve always tried to give players a lot of freedom when it comes to the controls and the action in the game, and give them lots of options that they can take and then do their own thing with,” Suzuki tells me. “So I’m expecting that there’s going to be a lot of weird things that they’re going to do with certain abilities. I can’t say what those abilities are, but I already have a few ideas because I’ve left a lot of things open-ended in that way. \n“I’m really excited to see what players will do with them because there are definitely things that I didn’t expect, but I do like putting that stuff out there so that they have stuff to play with and surprise me with. When they do things I expected, I’m happy, but I’m also really happy when they [...] do something that is completely unexpected. It’s one of the exciting things about being a developer.”\nLike Suzuki, I look forward to seeing what far more advanced players do with FFXVI’s combat, and fortunately, we have less than a month to go. \nFor more, be sure to check out Game Informer’s exclusive FFXVI coverage hub by clicking the banner below.",

Even before mounting on his included stand, Prime stands at 16 inches tall.\nThe team even brought in legendary voice actor Peter Cullen to reprise his role and record brand-new lines for the character to spout.\nThe new Rise of the Beasts Optimus Prime limited edition collectible will put you back a hefty sum; it’s currently on a preorder sale of $699 (instead of the regular price of $899). If that's not too high a price for controlling an intergalactic hero, he's all yours. The vaunted Aubobot leader will be ready to head out on a mission to your home in the fourth quarter of 2023.",

          "description": "Final Fantasy XVI is the most action-forward game in the mainline series’ history, and while it’s been a point of contention between players excited for this and fans of the franchise who yearn for something turn-based, it’s hard to deny the combat looks flashy and fun. And as someone who’s played a few hours of the game, I can say it is. \nWhile I attribute most of that to how great it feels to control Clive, it turns out there might be some tricks developer Creative Business Unit III learned developing Final Fantasy XIV’s action to make FFXVI’s combat feel even more satisfying beyond the actual gameplay. \n“For example, in boss battles, when you have an attack and you may see certain areas on the ground that light up to show that’s where the attack’s going to be, that’s something you might…",

The primary focus of FFXVI will be playing through Clive’s story and all it entails, but there’s more to the game than just the main scenario. \nI was curious about how players will get around Valisthea, especially with developer Creative Business Unit III at the helm. In its MMO, Final Fantasy XIV, mounts are abundant. You can ride chocobos, the Regalia from Final Fantasy XV, Magitek armor, and more. There are dozens of mounts to acquire in-game, and I wondered if that would bleed over into FFXVI. \n“To tell you the truth, it’s pretty much just chocobos,” FFXVI director Hiroshi Takai tells me. “In past Final Fantasy games, you’d have canoes or boats or …",

The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it?

As the name implies, this new version delivers plenty of evolved forms of Paldean Pokémon while expanding on the pre-existing catalog of Paldean and non-Paldean monsters.\nThis second expansion in the Scarlet & Violet series of cards brings with it more than 190 new cards, including 15 Pokémon ex cards, Tera Pokémon ex cards with a crystalline appearance, more than 30 Trainer cards, and dozens of Pokémon and Trainer cards with special illustrations. The Pokémon Company sent over several booster packs for us to open and see what we could pull, and those with the special illustrations ended up being the highlight of my pack-opening experience.\nYou can see my favorite of the cards I pulled in the gallery below.\n\nI was pretty happy with the cards I pulled from the packs. My favorite is probably the special Elite Trainer Box Pikachu card, which features the three Paldean starters in the background, though I also love the Pikachu I pulled from a booster pack. Outside of that, I enjoyed seeing the various Paldean starters' evolved forms, though, for some reason, my pulls skewed heavily toward Quaxly's evolution line. Outside of this most recent generation of Pokémon, I was happy to snag some updated cards of old favorites, such as Gyarados, Raichu, and Tyranitar.\nIn addition to being the second Pokémon Trading Card Game to bear the Scarlet & Violet name, it's also the second pack to come at a higher price tag. However, The Pokémon Company has at least tried to deliver some benefits to this, as each pack includes more foils, and even the wrapper of each booster pack feels thicker and of higher quality than the original Scarlet & Violet expansion.\nPokémon Trading Card Game: Scarlet & Violet – Paldea Evolved arrives on June 9.

Shortly after, Cid brings Clive to a place dubbed Cid’s hideaway. \nThis hideaway is one of the main hubs in FFXVI.

          "description": "When discussing Final Fantasy XVI’s combat or watching gameplay, it’s hard not to think about other action combat games, such as Capcom’s Devil May Cry series. And if its combat reminds you of DMC, it’s probably because the combat director of FFXVI is Ryota Suzuki, who helped design combat on Devil May Cry 4 and Devil May Cry 5. But he also worked on Marvel Vs. Capcom 2. \nWhile the DMC inspirations laced within FFXVI’s combat are hard to miss, Suzuki told me that Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 inspired some of FFXVI's systems as well. \n“There’s actually something from Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 that we took and put into Final Fantasy XVI, and that is, as you may or may not know, in Marvel Vs. Capcom 2, we had the Assist system where you could give orders to your partner in battle,” Suzuki says. “And by impl…",

          "description": "Atari and developer Sneakybox have announced Days of Doom, an apocalyptic turn-based tactical roguelite. The game hopes to subvert the expectations of those who are tired of the brown and gray color palettes of other apocalypse settings by placing the action over vibrant and colorful backdrops as you battle through hordes of zombies, raiders, and mutant lizards. \nNavigating the wasteland to reach a sanctuary will require strategy, as you must combat the encroaching mutated forces using your group of distinct survivors. Beyond the turn-based tactics at play, you must also manage your scarce collection of resources and keep your wits about you as you maneuver through the hordes of the undead.\n\nEach of the eight survivor classes features unique abilities that can be used to shift your fortunes in battle. For example, the Pyro class allows you to burn enemies and leave them with residual damage each turn while combining the Hydromancer with the Thrasher can drench enemies with water before electrocuting them for a devastating synergy. Players will need to use these abilities to their advantage and think strategically with these abilities to overcome the seemingly insurmountable odds.\nAnd, of course, with it being a roguelite game, players can expect each run to feel unique. More than 50 randomly occurring events present risk-reward scenarios for players during their runs, while more than 70 collectible items and runes can help you turn the odds in your favor in your given run. However, as you play several runs and make progress, you unlock permanent upgrades, such as party size increases and resource accumulation speed.\nIf you'd like to learn more, you can check out the reveal trailer below.\n\n\nDays of Doom arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, PC, and Atari VCS later this year.",

Battlefields are covered in soapy foam, which players can use to their advantage by creating slippery surfaces to slide at high speeds. Foam can also be used in other ways, such as to shield yourself and your teammates from attacks or create vantage points. The trailer shows off a bunch of goofy weapons and the game pretty much feels like the anti-thesis of Splatoon. \n\n\nSquare Enix promises to share more about Foamstars in the future, but it’s coming to PlayStation 5 and 4.",

At the tail end of that announcement, however, was another exciting, admittedly smaller announcement that the first three Metal Gear Solid games will be ported to PlayStation 5 in one presumed package.\nThe single image above appeared at the end of the Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater remake teaser with the words, \"Sneak back into the original games on PlayStation 5,\" with an autumn 2023 release window. The package is called Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Volume 1, which implies more Metal Gears may be on the way. A Volume 2 could, hopefully, finally free Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots from its PlayStation 3 prison – the only platform that game has ever been made available on.\nUpdate: According to the game's listing on the PlayStation Store, the package will also include the original Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake. Here is how the the listing of included games is worded on the page.\nMetal Gear\nMetal Gear 2: Solid Snake\nMetal Gear Solid (Including VR Missions/Special Missions)\nMetal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty (HD Collection version)\nMetal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater (HD Collection version)",
