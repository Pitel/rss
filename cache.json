Special Edition — a rerelease of the notoriously difficult original for modern consoles — and its unlikely sequel.

          "description": "In theory, vampires and immersive sims go together as naturally as bats and caves. Immersive sims tend to involve a balance of stealth, acrobatics, raw strength and crafty manipulation, and vampires are celebrated for all of these things. Despite this, actual vampire-themed immersive sims are rare. My list starts with Vampire: the Masquerade: Bloodlines... and sort of ends there. In a devastating betrayal, Arkane Austin's Redfall wasn't an immersive sim but an open world co-op shooter (a not very good one). The much-delayed Bloodlines 2 was recently downgraded from immersive sim to RPG by new developers The Chinese Room. Arkane Lyon's Blade adaptation seems promising, but it's a ways off. \r\n\n\r\nHere to paper over the immersive vamping gap in the market is Byte Barrel's Trust, \"a new first-person shooter with immersive sim elements\". It takes place in a world where the vampires are hunted for their blood, which has become an everyday human energy source, used for everything from car batteries to streetlights. The irony! I feel like, in the circumstances, the ideal solution would be for humans to let vampires suck their blood in return for vampires letting humans use their blood for electricity, but that wouldn't make for a very thrilling shooter. Anyway, here's the trailer.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Alruna And The Necro-Industrialists opens with paired quotes from T.S. Eliot's The Wasteland and Mad Max: Fury Road - a blend of influences that would typically get you kicked out of the Creative Writing Club for being simultaneously too fancy and too obvious, but the game beyond the epigraph looks pretty swish.\nIt's \"a compact and high-density Metroidvania, with a focus on sequence-breaking and playing things out of order\". It uses a square aspect display ratio calibrated to give wizened Game Boy enthusiasts the shakes, and is made up of 200 single-screen rooms that \"slot into the larger puzzle-box of the world\". Also, you play a thorn witch who looks a bit like 1950s Tinkerbell, with a touch of Betty Boop. Here's a trailer.\n Read more",

The latest update for the physics-based open world build-a-car game introduces a mountable theodolite, which lets you stitch together monorail networks you can then ride about on.\nIf monorails strike you as frivolous, don't worry. It's more of a Shelbyville idea. And in any case, the theodolite also lets you construct networks of pipes, power lines and rail-less tarmac roads - the ready-salted crisp of the road family. It’s a chonky expansion that, in the words of lead developer Ian MacLarty, has only “scratched the surface of where this new system could go”. I am predicting an eventual pivot into either themepark management or factory simulator.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Twenty hours ago I placed my first manufacturer somewhere around here. Back then it represented the state of the art, hatching me a pristine batch of 1.25 computers every minute - now I’ve forgotten where I put the damn thing, after delving into my factory’s guts to hook that piddly yet still useful batch of old relics up to my main production line. I’m building supercomputers now, and the many manufacturers that make those are hungry.\nSomething is always hungry in Satisfactory, and that hunger pulls you from task to task in a near-seamless and frankly beautiful daze of ever-escalating industry.

You draw a line down each object with your mouse, then click or hit space bar to perform a slice. Then, the game calculates a percentage.  If it's bang-on or very close to 50/50, you'll pass. If not, you'll have to start over. I know: this is how entire days are wasted. Sorry.\n Read more",

          "description": "There are many reasons to play and write about Arco. The Mesoamerican pixelart landscapes, for example - radiant, cloud-hung platters of land with people and buildings reduced to daubs of paint in the foreground. The fact that it's about witnessing and surviving colonial invasion, rather than the more familiar European or North American video game fantasy of searching a New World for plunder.\nThe ensemble storytelling, with four, successively playable characters setting their own lenses to thickly entangled themes of sorrow, vengeance and growing understanding. The sparse, expressive dialogue, each phrase carefully tucked inside its speech bubble. The music. And the little things at the level of how you move, what you do. When you pick a faraway destination on your map, your character makes the journey screen by screen, which gives you a second to lean back and be a passenger, watching the horizon, at least until you're ambushed by a giant beetle. \r\n \nRead more",

One that favours the joyous freeform sightseeing of an Elden Ring or Breath Of The Wild; where you’ll scramble up vast industrial concrete ruins on scavenging missions for inquisitive frogs, instead of being nagged by bothersome checklists?\nOk, rain check on that last point. SandWitch can’t help but eventually funnel the freedom of ambling around in your chuffy yellow van into restrictive collect-a-thons. Still, for much of its breezy runtime, this one’s a real panacea for gaming’s more bloated map-scourers. Plus, even when you are sent off to hamster-cheek scavenged components before making progress, there’s very little in this world that doesn’t feel intentional. Sidequests and storytelling crumbs are deliberately scattered throughout, and each building is a thoughtful concrete puzzle box. It is, in brief, a nice time.\nYou play as Sauge, a spacefarer returned to her planet of Cigalo after receiving a distress signal from her missing sister. Cigalo’s a cheery place, though economically and environmentally devastated after being exploited by an evil spacecorp named The Consortium. It’s populated by small settlements of people, some large talking frogs named the Reinetos, and the occasional friendly robot. Everything’s friendly, as it goes - even gravity itself. There’s no danger, no death, no damage from flinging yourself off the tallest building you can find. Just helping out your desert buds, upgrading your van with more gadgets to solve puzzles, or working on finding exactly where Sauge’s sister has go to.\n Read more",

Adults can manage parental controls, set hourly or daily playtime limits, approve purchase requests, and control store access.

You are dumped into the middle of an interstellar chase and summarily shown the ropes. The guns feel simplistic, the arenas bare, the loot vanilla, and the entire loop of beaming down to a planet and getting into small-scale \"showdowns\" threatens to become stale within the first hour or so. But then you find an outlaw buddy who offers a new way to shoot human dirtbags. Then another fellow bandit. And another. By the time your spaceship is half-filled with scoundrels and weirdoes shouting at each other, the game has warmed up enough to reveal its central idea. This ain't no grand FPS campaign, nor is it quick as roguelikes go. It's a snacky shootout sim with tumbleweed towns that feels best when you savour the pre-fight suspense.\nRead more",

All those onscreen 'Nids, yeah? And the stutterfest that was the recent preview build? Surely enough to make a Tech-Priest shed at least one oily tear.\nBut nah, turns out it’s fine. Pretty good, actually – perhaps not to the extent that you should tackle Space Marine 2 on a crusty notebook (or, for the record, a Steam Deck), but it runs decently on minimum specs and is noticeably more stable than in that preview. The only thing that might offend your PC’s machine spirit is some quality setting weirdness, where dropping or raising the graphics options can produce inconsistent results.\nRead more",

Picture it: careful judgments of your movements, weighing up the right time to strike, every measured jab part of a wider strategy that culminates in the kill.\nMOBAs are like that. Both in the fights themselves, sort of, where probing lunges lead up to bursts of lethality, but more broadly in each match as a whole. They’re map-wide knife fights, where a thrust is a well-judged lane push and a parry a savvy item buy. At first, playing Smite 2 felt akin to watching on helplessly as my opponents repeatedly shoved their crysknives through my ribs. After 30 hours, it often still feels like that - but I am enjoying myself. Mostly. Despite Valve’s third-person elephant in the lane. \nRead more",

          "description": "Nikhil Murthy's Syphilisation is a \"postcolonial 4X game\", which might sound like a contradiction in terms. While approaches to 4X and grand strategy vary hugely between games, factions and players, the genre as a whole is firmly wedded to imperial conquest, both structurally and at the level of narrative aspects and set-dressing. Many 4X games are triumphal re-enactments of specific periods of colonial settlement and expansion. All of which is to say that Syphilisation is fascinating. It's a reworking of the genre which dismantles and reconstructs concepts such as diplomacy, research and production. It's also just left early access - find more details and a playthrough video below.\n Read more",

While it wasn't outstanding in the grander landscape of gaming, enough Warhammer 40K fans seem to have cherished the escapades of bulky blue boltgunner Demetrian Titus for the action game to merit a sequel a decade later. It left its story on something of a cliffhanger, with said hero being dragged away to face untold tortures by the Inquisition, the most zealous sect of this preternaturally paranoid sci-fi universe. Today, Titus is free again. Free to stomp towards hordes of alien foes, blast them with a plasma incinerator, and shred the stragglers with a chainsaw sword. Space Marine 2 is an often-satisfying scrapper that has me  convinced of 40K's merit as a crafting ground for excellent-looking environments and creatures, even if I'm not particularly moved by the bland character of Titus and his fellow Ultramarines.\nRead more",

Since then Intel has continued releasing new CPUs under \"Family 6\" with different model IDs while AMD has been more open to changing its Family ID every Zen generation or two. With Intel using Family 6 for so long it led to a lot of Linux kernel code just relying on Model ID comparisons for determining between Intel CPU generations and the like. Thus a lot of Intel CPU model handling reworks are needed for preparing future Intel CPU generations that will no longer be in Family 6.

They'll offer some of the best abilities in the game, but you'll need to improve them further with Max Moves. Find out how to unlock Max Moves in Pokémon Go. \n\n\nHow do you unlock Max Moves in Pokémon Go?\n\n\nIn the third phase of To the Max!, you'll be tasked to \"unlock a Max Move.\" Although you may be inclined to max out a Pokémon's stats entirely, it's actually a lot simpler than you think. All you need to do is change a compatible Pokémon into a Dynamax form and then exchange Candies and Max Particles to unlock the Max Move.\n\n\nIf you have yet to obtain a Dynamax Pokémon, complete the first phase of To the Max! to earn one as a reward. Once you've acquired the critter, go to the Pokémon's page and select 'Dynamax.' You'll uncover two choices in Max Moves: Spirit and Guard. Choose Spirit for better healing, or use Guard to reduce attack damage. An attack will also be available in the first section, which can be upgraded with more Candies and Max Particles. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nTo give you an idea of how much you'll be spending in Pokémon Go, the Wooloo Dynamax's Max Guard Move costs 400 Max Particles and 50 Wooloo Candy. Each time you've trained your Pokémon with a Max Move, you'll earn some XP along with it.\n\n\nUse the Max Moves during Max Battles to successfully complete these challenging quests. Plus, you can claim a few rewards from the To the Max! Research, including Ultra Balls, Max Particles, and Stardust. However, keep in mind that Max Moves and the Dynamax form cannot be utilized during Trainer Battles. The moves also don't transfer when using the Pokémon Home app.\n\nThe post How to unlock Max Moves in Pokémon Go appeared first on Destructoid.",

He asks for something very specific, which doesn’t appear outside the quest — Ectoplasm. \n\n\nEctoplasm doesn’t show up as a gatherable item at any point outside of the Wizard’s Special Order quest, 'A Curious Substance'. After picking up the quest at the board in Pelican Town, you’ll have seven days to collect some Ectoplasm, but where to get it?\n\n\nLoations and enemies for Ectoplasm in Stardew Valley\n\n\nImage by Destructoid\n\n\nAs long as “ A Curious Substance” is active, Ectoplasm has a very small 9.5% chance to drop from the following monsters:\n\n\n\nGhosts\n\nFound in the Mines between floors 51 and 79\n\n\n\n\nCarbon Ghosts\n\nFound in Skull Cavern on Mummy levels\n\n\nFound between floors 31 and 39 of the Dangerous Mines\n\n\n\n\nPutrid Ghosts\n\nFound between floors 51 and 69 of the Dangerous Mines\n\n\n\n\n\nThe easiest way to get Ectoplasm for the quest is by taking the elevator down to floor 55 of the Mines and farming Ghosts on the floors before 79. Basic Ghosts have 96 HP, while Carbon and Putrid Ghosts have 190 and 500 HP, respectively. \n\n\nDrops from Ghost monsters in Stardew Valley\n\n\nEach of these monsters also have a chance to drop other items, regardless of whether “A Curious Substance” is active or not:\n\n\nGhosts\nCarbon Ghosts\nPutrid Ghosts\n\n\nDwarf Scroll II \nDwarf Scroll IV \nGhostfish\nGold Ore\nRefined Quartz\nSolar Essence\nOmni Geode\nRefined Quartz\nOmni Geode\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you’ve previously reached the final floor of the Mines, each of these monsters also has a chance to drop Diamonds and Prismatic Shards.

          "description": "As you progress in Anime Defenders, the time you invest in farming for rare units will increase. Although it can be somewhat tedious, some items improve your chances through their unique abilities. So, to even the odds, here's how to get the Hardened Portal in Anime Defenders.\n\n\nHow do you get Portal Hardeners in Anime Defenders?\n\n\nTo get Portal Hardeners in Anime Defenders, complete Anthenyx Realm challenges and claim rewards from its Battle Pass. The Anthenyx Realm was first introduced in Update 5, bringing forth new enemy types to fight against. You must reach Level 30 to gain entry to this area, including access to the exclusive Battle Pass.\n\n\nIf you've survived multiple Anthenyx waves, check your Battle Pass for free Portal Hardeners. There's also a Premium version for those who don't mind spending Robux.\n\n\nWith the Portal Hardener, you'll gain a duplicate drop for your current portal with a 100 percent chance. That means you'll have one more shot at the challenge, even if you fail it the first time around. However, to use the Portal Hardener, you'll need to craft a Hardened Portal recipe. For example, you'll need three Portal Hardeners and one Golden Knight Portal (Legendary) to receive the duplicate.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThere's a wide variety of portals you can utilize the Hardener with, such as the Solar, Demon, and Ancient Dragon. I suggest saving it for high-valued rare types, like Mythic and Legendary, since plowing through the Epic and Rare challenges will be much easier. You may even discover a Secret portal, unlocking some of the best units in Anime Defenders.\n\n\nThe higher rarities generally require three to five Portal Hardeners, so you'll need to be patient and persistent in your farming. Don't worry; it'll all be paid off once you acquire the more exclusive units and items.\n\nThe post How to get Portal Hardener in Anime Defenders appeared first on Destructoid.",

The Aberrant Action sidearm, Lost Signal grenade launcher, and Martyr's Retribution grenade launcher are three great examples of that. While getting the new weapons is the most exciting, however, some older weapons are still hefty powerhouses. Here's how to get the Indebted Kindness sidearm in Destiny 2.\n\n\nWhere to get the Indebted Kindness in Destiny 2\n\n\nImage via Destructoid.\n\n\nThe Indebted Kindness is available as a drop from the Warlord's Ruin dungeon, released with the Lightfall Dungeon Key. If you don't yet have it, it can be purchased from the Eververse store for 2,000 Silver. Unlike a lot of weapons, however, Indebted Kindness can drop from any of the three main encounters of the dungeon. This means your most effective method of farming will be to simply complete the dungeon on all three of your characters each week. Since you seemingly can't craft the weapon, you'll need to trust in RNG to give you the right roll.\n\n\nIndebted Kindness god roll\n\n\nIf you're farming for the best roll on the Indebted Kindness, you'll want the following setup:\n\n\n\nLauncher Barrel: Volatile Launch\n\n\nMagazine: Tactical Mag\n\n\nPerk 1: Lead from Gold\n\n\nPerk 2: Voltshot\n\n\n\nVolatile Launch gives a much better blast radius to each of your shots, at the cost of projectile speed and handling. Tactical Mag, meanwhile, gives better stability, reload speed, and magazine size at seemingly no downside. Lead from Gold is great for getting some of that precious special ammo back when picking up heavy bricks. Finally we have Voltshot, which causes your shots to jolt when reloading after a kill.
