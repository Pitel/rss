There was the Tingle Tuner in Wind Waker, new content and secrets in games from Harry Potter to Crash Bandicoot, and an entire new town in Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life.\nBack on the GameCube, A Wonderful Life had a path near the farm that went up a hill, but it didn't go anywhere. Trying to go up the path would lead to a cutscene where the Harvest Sprites would halt you, saying that you could find out \"what's going on\" by linking up with Friends of Mineral Town on the Game Boy Advance, which required the link cable, a GBA, and a copy of the game.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

You bet your chunky GamePad it didn’t.\nInstead of wallowing in self-pity, Nintendo knuckled down and used the Wii U's failure as a learning experience, addressing each imperfection and fashioning a little device with a clear, easy-to-understand, and appealing proposition for players who had found its predecessor's asymmetric gameplay confusing or underwhelming.

Developed by the small team at Mopeful Games, Fashion Police Squad is bringing all of this to the Switch when it sashays its way onto the console on 2nd February.\nThis is a game that will see you take to the streets of Trendopolis and set out on a mission to solve the city's fashion crimes. There's excessively baggy trousers, poorly-fitting suits, vests and jeans — welcome to the early 2000s folks!

It can be a mode of escape, a time to relax, a story to get deep into, or something to stimulate the mind. But the fact of the matter is, we also hate playing video games. They can be really hard, we lose unfairly, a mechanic doesn't sit right, or we forget to save.\nOf course, these frustrations are never permanent (isn't that what keeps us coming back, after all?), but this doesn't make them any less annoying. Sometimes we really need to complete a certain task to move on with the game and other times it is all about our own sanity: \"I have to overcome this obstacle/defeat this boss/find this item before I can put it down.\"\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Of course, this followed the six-year wait after the release of the original Nintendogs on the DS — a watershed moment where a huge number of us spent each day walking, cleaning and playing with the virtual pups. And now, it looks like there might be more dog content from Nintendo to come.\nA recent patent, dated 17th January 2023 and originally filed for in November 2021, seems to suggest that Nintendo is working on a new way to bring the world of virtual dogs back into our homes (thanks, My Nintendo News).

And on top of all that, you also have the ability to \"soul-jump\" letting you control any animal or object.\nIt sounds too good to be true, right? But two years after Awaceb's trailer debut, I’ve gotten my hands on a preview build to see whether a nine-person dev team’s tropical island exploration game is pie in the sky. Turns out, it’s the opposite; my hands on time suggests Tchia will deliver on everything it promised and more.\nRead more",

After a frankly disgusting number of hours, I'd finished all the stages. So, I thought, \"Yes, of course they will add the 2nd generation of Pokéfolks with a bunch of new stages.

          "description": "Indonesian studio Mojiken have been making games for years. Most of them are less than an hour long. They're short, punchy adventures and cover everything from digital fortune tellers, violin-playing owl-men, and poetic folktales about potato-shaped forest creatures. \nA Space For The Unbound is Mojiken’s first 'big' release in that sense, clocking in at around nine-ish hours. What begins as a YA coming-of-age tale about a small-town romance quickly gains remarkable momentum, and suddenly you’re dealing with supernatural teens trying to desperately stop a world-ending calamity. Part sci-fi drama, part high school romance, A Space For The Unbound manages to have incredible weight and grandeur while also being poignant, sweet, and honest at the same time. It's a triumph.\nRead more",

          "description": "In games it's often a delight to be proven wrong. Such as, for example, my longstanding belief that Dwarf Fortress would never make the biggest and most important change it possibly could, and fit itself with an interface fit for purpose.\r\n\nBay 12 Games have, of course, gone further than that, and released it for general sale on the biggest shop in the business after sixteen years as freeware. There's even a charming new graphics overhaul to replace the famous ASCII symbols which, depending on who you ask, might not have technically counted as \"graphics\" at all.\nI'm not here to discuss the relative merits of this shiny new version and the \"classic\" version. Both will be updated in future, the latter still free, and neither expected to reach a full 1.0 release inside 20 years. All this chips around the edges of what I've been pondering, which is this: What exactly is Dwarf Fortress's place within our culture now, after a decade replete with games that looked to it for ideas?\nRead more",

A while back developers Eggnut teased that they were working on a new game, and it turns out that game is Tails: The Backbone Preludes, a prequel that probably won't answer any questions you might've had about the ending of Backbone.

(The third camp was \"eh, I might check it out\" and watched the other two camps duking it out). I was in camp two. If you're adapting something, adapt! Make changes! Otherwise I might as well just consume the original thing again! The Last Of Us has already been released, what, three times?\nThis was made funnier by the fact that nobody on staff had seen the TV show, so we were just arguing about tweets we'd seen that describe the show, the worst way to conduct a discussion outside of e.g. scrawling insults on the side of Teslas and self-driving them into each other's front doors.

Since 2019, YouTuber \"Mojo Swoptops\" has rebuilt a wide and weird range of Edinburgh sights inside Far Cry 5's level editor, from the big tourist landmarks like the castle and Forth Bridge to perfectly mundane places such as blocks of flats and nightclubs at chucking-out time. As an Edinburgh resident, it's great fun to see, and a very pleasing contrast to the gleaming miniature reimagination seen in Forza Horizon 4.\nRead more",

The final hour or so was split into two parts, thanks to a lovely dev who time-skipped me forwards and into the game's open world, before warping me through a gate and into an early boss's lair. There was a lot to take in, from robo-gloves, to sex-dom vending machines, to grannies with bazookas.\nI went in with expectations that it might be a little like BioShock, all steely and serious in its delivery of some vaguely philosophical truth. But I emerged with a totally different impression. Far from polished seriousness, Atomic Heart seems a little disjointed in its ambition, with a main character who almost immediately kills any atmosphere when he opens his mouth.\nRead more",

You know, as video game TV shows go. I've yet to sit down and watch it myself, but I'll probably be doing so this evening to see what's what. \nA question I've been pondering in the run-up to The Last Of Us' TV debut, however, is this: if I watch the TV show now, will I really be bothered to actually sit down and play Part 1 when it finally comes to Steam at the beginning of March? 'Cause I sure don't have time (or the inclination) to do both. I think that might be too much The Last Of Us... But what about you, readers? Will you be tuning in, or waiting to play it on PC? Or both! Tell us in the comments below.\nRead more",

          "description": "What makes a good platformer? Christ, I don't know. Why would you open an article with that. Calling Kandria a platformer feels a little reductive, so there's a need to clarify why it works. You play as an android revived several decades after an apocalypse, by a tiny camp of survivors who inevitably need your help. A lot of this help involves, well, platforming. To the point of having nonsensical areas of pure platforming in between you and a destination or secret area. You'll climb, jump, do the little dash thing that recharges when you touch the ground or pick up a hovering lamp thingy. You'll land on a lot of thorny instakill spikes.\r\n\n\r\nSo yeh, lots of the old platforming, but it feels more like an exploration and scavenging game, with a side order of light-light-heavy-dodge combat too. And a plot with varied dialogue options and mysteries about the world and its history. It's immediately and consistently fun, but I'm not sure exactly how to recommend it. Hmm.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Considering Carpenter hasn’t made a film in 13 years it does seem a bit of a wild idea, but then the director is both a horror auteur and video game fan.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Writing up our big guide on all the upcoming PC games of 2023, I was introduced to a number of smaller games in development I hadn't heard about before. One of them was Broken Roads, an isometric RPG set in a post-apocalypse Australia. The gorgeous artwork was enough for me to click on the Steam page and read more, and while scrolling through the screenshots something strange caught my eye.\nIt was a screenshot of a fairly traditional RPG dialogue scene, with a panel at the bottom displaying all the possible dialogue options for the player. But what caught my eye was an unusual radial graphic on the right-hand side of the options. Reading on, I discovered that Broken Roads uses a rather unique Moral Compass, one which plots your overall moral stance towards the world and its people with a golden arc. Different decisions may rotate the arc, expand it, contract it, lengthen it, or shorten it. And in so doing, you'll unlock various traits dotted about the Compass, which only remain in effect for as long as that golden arc covers those traits within the wheel.\nI can see a dozen different ways in which this Moral Compass may end up being a bad idea in practice. But I don't care. I adore it. And I'm going to play Broken Roads solely so I can see the consequences of my actions in satisfying radial form.\nRead more",

I liked time-travelling between Dracula's abode and ancient greece, chopping a variety of killer goblins that squawked, \"NICE TO MEET YOU!\", in varying octaves.\nWhile another FPS of the \"micro\" variety would be grand, I'd love a \"microracer\". Much in the same vein as my beloved Screamer, I'm desperate for a – linear or otherwise – arcade racer whose only concern is to burn rubber through all manner of world stages.\nRead more",

          "description": "Linda Tiger's career in gaming started two decades ago, in a test house in Glasgow. “I started in QA back in 2002. I worked on functionality and localisation testing. Eventually, I became a lead and then a QA manager at a studio,” she tells me, as we talk at India Game Developers Conference in Hyderabad, India. Now, Tiger is at Paradox Development Studio as the studio manager of Studio Black, and the former lead producer for Crusader Kings 3. She even stood in front of a suit of armor to drop the game's first tease.\r\n\n\r\n An RPG-esque lifestyle system and neat backstab choices that deal with information round out Crusader Kings 3's host of improvements over its excellent predecessor. A court-themed expansion and a revamp of the game’s culture system after launch are a testament to Paradox’s resolve to deliver a refined plotting experience. Holy wars and illicit affairs go hand in hand in the world of Crusader Kings and the third iteration is no different. Weaving together systems to consistently deliver emergent gameplay is no simple feat, and it turns out that production also covers all manner of small but essential, and practical things. As the lead producer on a game as complex as Crusader Kings 3, Tiger had her work cut out for her. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "With last week's launch of Intel's 4th Gen Xeon Scalable Sapphire Rapids server processors, Intel heavily talked up the shiny new accelerators and the big performance potential of AMX, but not really showcased and only heard through the grapevine was the improved AVX-512 implementation found with these new processors. With Sapphire Rapids there is reduced penalties from engaging AVX-512 -- and for some AVX-512 instructions, no longer any measurable impact -- compared to prior generation Xeon processors. In this article is a look at the performance for a wide variety of workloads with AVX-512 on/off not just for Sapphire Rapids but also for prior generation Ice Lake as well as AMD's new EPYC 4th Gen \"Genoa\" processors where they have introduced AVX-512 for the first time.",

A \"good story\" in a video game is usually a coherent narrative with characters and events, ideally one that's augmented or enhanced by gameplay. On occasion, folks will point to something like Dwarf Fortress, a game that uses the foundations of interactivity to generate elaborate narratives.\n[caption id=\"attachment_358665\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Kitfox Games[/caption]\nI think there's another, more interesting type of video game narrative, though.

          "description": "We missed you, 1v1\nWarzone 2.0 brought about a whole host of changes to Call of Duty's beloved battle royale mode, but the most divisive of them all has to be the new version of the Gulag, which changed from a 1v1 fight to a 2v2 with the introduction of the sequel. As if it wasn't already hard enough contending with two enemies instead of one, especially if you have a teammate who is AFK, uncooperative, etc., they also added a Jailer with a minigun for you to contend with, too. It's clear to me why this was one of the least popular changes that came along with Warzone 2.0.\nThankfully we won't have to put up with it for very much longer, though, because Infinity Ward has announced on Twitter that they're reverting the Gulag back to its former 1v1 glory. This change is scheduled to be implemented along with the Season 2 update for both Warzone 2.0 and Modern Warfare II, which we learned yesterday has been delayed by two weeks. I guess this gives us yet another reason to look forward to the game's second season, along with bug fixes, a new Raid episode, and new game modes, just to name a few of the upcoming features.\nhttps://twitter.com/InfinityWard/status/1616133411189710848\nSeason 2 is officially dropping on February 15, as per a tweet from the Call of Duty Twitter account yesterday, so we only have to deal with the 2v2 shenanigans for a little while longer. It's nice that they wanted to branch out and try something new to keep things feeling fresh, but unfortunately, this turned out to be more of a \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\" situation.\nThe post Season 2 of Warzone 2.0 is bringing back the 1v1 Gulag appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's like if Mario Party and Dragon Quest somehow blended together into a chaotic competition for the throne.\nPlaying as one of several adventurers, each player's goal is to defeat beasts, gather money, and eventually win the throne. Of course, while this is your goal, it's everyone else's too, and there can only be one ruler in the Dokapon Kingdom.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfU6eDroSN4\nTake down monsters or other players, gain control of towns, and learn new job classes all in pursuit of the ultimate victory. There are five different game modes to choose from: Normal, Story, Shopping Race, Kill Race, and Town Race. Plus, the board is fairly expansive, so there's good reason to replay it in different modes and combinations.\nOne big addition is the Connect aspect of Dokapon Kingdom: Connect. Players will be able to hop online and battle with their friends across the different game modes too, so now you won't need to all be on the same couch to fight for the kingdom. If my experience with Mario Party is any indication, it might be better that players are not in close proximity for these games.\nMy kingdom on the Switch\nDokapon Kingdom is one of those games I've heard whispered about time and again. It's often described as an alternative to Mario Party, one that maintains the screwing-over-your-friends fun but eschews some of the mini-games in favor of some light RPG activities.\nHonestly, the style mash-up of classic RPGs and party games alone is enough to draw me in. With online play added too, it seems like Dokapon fans have something to look forward to this spring.\nThe post Dokapon Kingdom: Connect brings the party RPG to Switch this spring appeared first on Destructoid.",

The crux of the release, however, lies in its fully remixed and re-recorded soundtrack, which sports a plethora of celebrated names from Japan's electronica scene.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIaYNsy57CA&ab_channel=NISAmerica\nAmong the musicians featured in the new release are GoSatoBan, Heavy Metal Raiden, Fantom Iris, O.T.K., Soshi Hosoi, Daisuke Matsumoto, Cosio, Keishi Yonao, Ryu☆, Raito, and Yu Shimoda — who have recorded a total of 20 new stage and boss battle themes. Raiden III x MIKADO MANIAX also features a customizable U.I. and soundtrack, allowing players to choose from a selection of wallpapers, and define a personal playlist of their favourite tunes from both the original and re-recorded scores.\nRaiden III x MIKADO MANIAX launches summer 2023 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch. A Collector's Edition is now available to pre-order from the NIS America Online Store.

Overall, I think the quality of the game will shine through for a lot of people though.\nOf course, there are two huge ports coming to the Switch today too: Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden.

With that spirit in mind, Like a Dragon: Ishin! is highlighting its farming life mode in a new trailer.\nIn a mode called \"Another Life,\" Ishin protagonist Ryoma leaves the violence for another day and instead tends to his quiet farm. We see a host of different mini-games and activities here, centered around living off the land. There's harvesting crops, chopping up veggies and preparing meat through cooking, and yes, even pets.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZJ_dc5gv-k\nIt's something special seeing a dog do a backflip. This side story seems to be bringing a heaping pile of peaceful slice-of-life warmth to the table, and I do enjoy that.\nFarming like a dragon\nLike a Dragon: Ishin! is the updated version of its historical fiction predecessor, which takes the cast of the Like a Dragon series and has them play out a story in a real, historical setting. Longtime series protagonist Kazuma Kiryu stars as Ryoma, and other characters from the series are set to appear as well.\nIshin is one of the Like a Dragon entries that hadn't arrived in the West yet. An official launch on modern consoles makes this a bit easier to get a hold of and play. Plus, now U.S. players can experience the joy of tending to a farm in 1860s Japan. Of course, there will still be fighting, intrigue, and plenty of drama. It's nice to have options, though.\nIf the quiet life appeals to you, you won't need to wait long to experience it either. Like a Dragon: Ishin! arrives for PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC on February 21, 2023.\nThe post Like a Dragon: Ishin! shows a slice of the quiet farm life in new trailer appeared first on Destructoid.",

With the fourth entry, Triumph Studios returns to the fantasy realm with its usual mix of magic, role-playing, strategy, and turn-based battles.\nA showcase is being hosted today on the Paradox Interactive Twitch channel, highlighting some of what's in store for the new Age of Wonders. But if you want a glimpse of the future, there's also a teaser trailer here too:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgV66Jdj23c\nThe different factions are composed of the usual fantasy races, including moon elves and halflings, and can be altered even further with tomes of magic. The big world map and focused-in turn-based battles make for small choices that can ripple out across the map.\n\nStories of adventure\nFor Age of Wonders 4, a new event system will add some extra storytelling potential. Triumph says decisions will shape the world around you, responding to your goals and ambitions, and that you may even see your own creations appear as rivals or allies in subsequent games.\nCreation and open-ended storytelling potential seem to be the draws here, and it sounds pretty neat. Having dabbled just a small bit in Age of Wonders III ages ago, I'm curious to see what this team has put together for its return to the fantasy realm. We won't have to wait long to find out, either. Age of Wonders 4 aims to launch on May 2, 2023 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.\nThe post Age of Wonders 4 marks a return for the fantasy strategy series this May appeared first on Destructoid.",

King rounds off the look with a similarly colored variant of his Jaguar mask and a massive pair of white running shoes. Over the following years, the look has become something of a meme icon among the Tekken community.\n\nYesterday, PRIX launched replica designs of both the track pants and the shirt, both priced at $70. A form-fitting, long sleeve variant of the shirt was also available at $60. Of course, there was a wild rush on these fashion-forward items, resulting in a total sell-out of the pants, while most of the shirt inventory was also cleared out double-quick time. There is currently a waiting list available on site for all those hoping to jump on any possible re-stocks.\nIn addition to the King gear, PRIX also released a line of T-shirts featuring renders of characters from Tekken 3. Again, these items are mostly long gone, with only Extra Small-to-Small sizes still available at the time of writing. You can check out the entire range over on the PRIX website.\nCongratulations to the lucky buyers. I hope that you're practicing your standing moonsault as we speak.\nTekken 8 launches on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X later in 2023.\nThe post PRIX clothing releases King’s iconic Tekken 3 fit, immediately sells out appeared first on Destructoid.",

The first episode premiered on the Roblox platform on December 10, with the 10-episode saga debuting on Netflix proper on December 15.\nhttps://twitter.com/sonic_hedgehog/status/1615767982214631425?s=20&t=WebPk-h3ZxgMeWVO_67AYg\nNo further details were announced regarding the new episodes. The tweet did not confirm whether this was classed as a \"second season\", nor whether the show will be returning to the Netflix streaming service. But we'll be sure to give you a heads-up when the talented animation squad behind the series has more information to offer.\nThe debut of Sonic Prime rounded off a pretty eventful year for the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise, with the past 12 months also seeing the release of remaster Sonic Origins, open-world adventure Sonic Frontiers, and the hugely successful cinematic sequel Sonic the Hedgehog 2. In a statement made last month, Team Sonic president Takashi Iizuka opined that 2022 was \"The biggest year in Sonic history.\"\nSonic Prime is available to watch now on Netflix.\nThe post More Sonic Prime episodes to hit the airwaves in 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Neither Activision nor Infinity Ward have officially announced any dates yet regarding the new season, but fans have surmised that the release date was supposed to be February 1 by looking at the days left on the Season 1 battle pass.\nBased on a tweet from known data miner CODSploitz, Season 2 will allegedly drop on or around February 15. By mining for the dates of the last Season 1 bundle, CODSploitz claims to have found that the final Scavenger bundle will be available in the store from February 2-15 -- hence the supposed Season 2 delay to that date, or sometime after it. CODSploitz's predictions have been right in the past, so we'll have to see if this one helps or hurts his track record when Season 2 finally drops.\nhttps://twitter.com/codsploitz_imgs/status/1615158500493037568\nThe last major update we saw for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II came in the form of Season 1 Reloaded from back in December. That update came with bug fixes, which added the Chimera assault rifle, the brand new Raid mode, and my personal favorite, the Shipment 6v6 multiplayer map.

The team has apparently been looking around at a bevvy of projects, and we'll just have to wait until Monday to see what exactly the studio is doing next.\nA whole new (steam) world\nThunderful has been working on the SteamWorld series for years, stretching back to early games like SteamWorld Tower Defense and what many might consider its breakout, SteamWorld Dig. Several more SteamWorld games followed, ranging from the tactical Heist and deckbuilding Quest to another Dig. And, also, The Gunk. Not sure if that one ties into the SteamWorld universe or not, to be honest.\nEither way, the Thunderful crew has made some wonderful games that have jumped across genres in the past. The past report from Thunderful included several different possibilities, ranging from SteamWorld Headhunter to a city-builder, turn-based game, and puzzle game. We'll see what new horizons the SteamWorld team is pursuing on Monday.\nThe post SteamWorld Telegraph stream will spotlight what’s next for the series on January 23 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The first event kicks off on January 27\nDid you get your Charizard or Cinderace yet? While those events are in the rear view mirror (hopefully we get info soon on how others can get them in the future), there's another one coming up, as per The Pokemon Company. Yep, Pokemon Scarlet & Violet players will be able to catch a special Greninja in January via the Tera Raid mechanic.\nJust like the previous Charizard and Cinderace events, the following parameters will apply:\nYou can only catch one Greninja per save file (but you can repeat the encounter as many times as you want for rewards)\nIt'll be a Poison Tera Type, in a 7-star raid\nThe event will take place over the course of two weekends, so if you miss one or aren't ready for 7-Star Tera Raids, you have a second chance\nLike the prior two events, you will likely be able to create eggs for the entire Greninja evolutionary line, starting with Froakie (so while you can only \"catch\" one, you can keep breeding them, if history repeats itself)\nHere are when the Pokemon Scarlet & Violet Greninja events start:\nJanuary 27-January 28, 2023\nFebruary 10-February 12, 2023\nAs a reminder, make sure you prep for 6-star Tera Raids before this date, as you'll need to complete that quest path to unlock 7-star raids. We have a comprehensive guide on how to get that done in a reasonable amount of time here! While the Charizard and Cinderace events were cutting things a little close for casual players, at this point a lot of you are probably at the finish line for high-end raids: you just need to cross it.\nThe post PSA: Greninja is the latest Pokémon Scarlet & Violet event exclusive, here are all the details appeared first on Destructoid.",

The specifications range from \"Minimum\" (720p at 60FPS) to a top-tier \"Ray-Tracing\" bracket (4K at 60FPS with enhanced reflections and shadows).\nFor those yet to experience Returnal, it showcases Housemarque's trademark flashy, firework-like visual aesthetic, as well as fast-paced and incredibly \"busy\" on-screen action. As such, the true wonder of its (literal) death-defying tale of identity and destiny, all set against the backdrop of a massive alien world, understandably requires a decent amount of juice in its myriad gas tanks.\nReturnal launches February 15 on PC (Steam).

Why the PSP version? Unlike the philosophical question of our purpose, there probably is a good answer for why we’re getting Persona 3 Portable instead of one of its console kin, but we don’t really know it. There have been theories about the Persona 3 FES code being a mess or having been lost, but that’s exactly what I hear every time there’s a poor or missing port. Then there’s the rumor that Persona 3 is being remade, which I also doubt, but maybe.\nIn any case, here we are: Persona 3 Portable on console and PC.\nThe worst part about the whole experience is that I’m constantly wondering what I’m doing on this version and whether or…",

It will launch on PS5 and Xbox Series X on March 16, priced at around $40. Pre-orders are now live on PSN and Microsoft Store.\nAnno 1800 is a real-time-strategy city-builder, set against the backdrop of the industrial revolution of the 19th century. Players are tasked with the micro-management of citizens, factories, economies, tourism, and the overall maintenance of industry, residential life, and local politics, guiding the people and politics of the 1800s into what would come to be known as \"The New World\".\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p1TDbV0gBA&ab_channel=Ubisoft\nAnno 1800 offers up several ways to play, from single-player stories and multiplayer PvP, to an hour-eating sandbox mode, which allows you to build your own empire unencumbered by interference or regulation. Online co-op is also available, allowing you and a friend to build an economically viable new world together. Additionally, players can send voyages across the seven seas to discover new produce, technologies, and people, further enriching the environment and industry back home, and expanding your burgeoning empire into bold new horizons.\nAnno 1800: Console Edition launches on PS5 and Xbox Series X on March 16. Pre-order customers will receive an in-game bonus in the form of a digital artbook, digital soundtrack, and access to the \"Imperial\" and \"Founders\" DLC packages, which will include \"Cosmetic Bonuses\". Additionally, a Deluxe Edition, retailing for around $50, includes further cosmetic expansions \"The Pedestrian Zone\", \"The Amusements Pack\" and \"Vibrant Cities.\"\nThe post Anno 1800 is finally coming to consoles in March appeared first on Destructoid.",

Combined with other previously announced titles, like Horizon: Call of the Mountain, PlayStation VR2 will have over 30 games available to play within a month of launch.\nPlayStation VR2 is set to come out on February 22, just over a month from today.

Of course, Rotten Tomatoes doesn't account for every person that watched the series, but it's a quick look at what audiences thought. It seems Netflix is ready to answer the desire for more because the official Sonic the Hedgehog Twitter account announced today that more Sonic Prime episodes are coming later this year. \nGet ready to sink into more Sonic Prime, coming your way later this year! pic.twitter.com/VNz1aDYfph\nJanuary 18, 2023\nAs you can see, there's not much to go on here, so it's currently unclear if these are just additional episodes or the reveal that a Season 2 is happening.

Interactive have released a new cinematic trailer for Hogwarts Legacy, giving viewers a bird's eye view, literally, of the titular school and the surrounding castle grounds. \nWith Hogwarts Legacy due out on current-get consoles and PC in just a few weeks, on February 10, it's no surprise we're getting a trailer like this today. It's a great look at what to expect in the game, including beasts and creatures, characters like Professor Weasley and Nearly Headless Nick, and more. There's even some Avada Kadavra-casting foes to be seen, as well as dragons and spiders to fights. And all of it is shown through the view of an owl delivering a Hogwarts acceptance letter to a soon-to-be wizard. \nCheck out the 4K version of this Hogwarts Legacy cinematic trailer below: \n\n\nFor more about Hogwarts Legacy, check out everything we learned in the second gameplay showcase, which aired last month, and then read about the latest details revealed during a Sony State of Play last year. Check out Hogwarts Legacy's PlayStation 5 DualSense features after that. Read about how controversial Harry Potter creator JK Rowling is not involved with the making of Hogwarts Legacy (although she will almost certainly be getting money as a direct result of this game) and then check out this trailer showcasing common rooms, easter eggs, and more. \nHogwarts Legacy hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on February 10.

          "description": "Persona 3 released in North America in 2007 on PlayStation 2 and was a mild hit. The dark, teen drama RPG had a niche audience, but those who found the game adored it. The game received a special edition release with added in content in 2008 with FES, and was then re-released a third time for PSP in 2010 with the most added content, but some modifications made to run on Sony's handheld platform.\nPersona 4 followed – again a mild hit – but then Persona 5 came along and cemented the franchise's reputation as one of the best RPGs ever made. Fans who discovered the series with 5 have wanted to figure out what they've been missing out on, and longtime players have been demanding the re-release of 3 so that a larger audience could play what many call their favorite. After arguably too long, Atlus is finally ready to make that happen with the re-re-re-release of Persona 3 on modern consoles January 19.\nJoin Kyle Hilliard and Wesley LeBlanc as they look at the game's first true dungeon and chat about perhaps the most controversial Persona game in the series.\n\n\nFor more previews of some of the biggest games of 2022 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for NGTs about Vengeful Guardian: Moonrider, Fire Emblem Engage, Clive 'N' Wrench, Inkulinati, Outer Terror, and more.",

Its first-party studios were shut down just over a year in, with the service being “deprioritized” a year later. While it was an interesting experiment, some experiments are just destined to fail.

We look forward to fans around the world enjoying the rest of the season.\" \n\"Our focus was simply to make the best possible adaption of this beloved story for as big an audience as we could,\" Druckmann and Mazin said, according to Deadline. \"We are overjoyed to see how many fans, both old and new, have welcomed The Last of Us into their homes and their hearts.\" \nWhile waiting for this week's episode, read our interview with Druckmann and Joel actor Pedro Pascal about how The Last of Us was changed for TV, and then read about how there are no plans for The Last of Us show to go beyond the games. \n[Source: Deadline]",

          "description": "Final Fantasy XVI is due out June 22 exclusively on PlayStation 5, but some fans believe a PC version of the game could release as soon as six months after its console debut. However, FF16 producer Naoki Yoshida isn't sure why. \nDuring a recent Final Fantasy XIV stream, Yoshida, who is a director on that game, was asked about rumors surrounding a PC version of FF16, and he responded, \"I don't know where the notion of a PC version releasing six months after the game is out came from as none of us have ever said that,\" according to a translator, as reported by Eurogamer. He followed it up with two instances urging fans to buy the PS5 version. \nAccording to a translation by Siliconera, Yoshida also said, \"There's been talk that the PC version will come out, but no one on the team has said anything about the PC version. I wonder why people assume the PC version will arrive six months after [the PS5 version], so just go ahead and buy a PS5.\" \nThe talk of a PC version of the game stems from a promotional PlayStation 5 video released last year that says in small print that FF16 will be a \"PS5 exclusive for six months.\" Some extrapolated from this small print that a PC release of the game will come after that six months of exclusivity is up, but if Yoshida's recent comments are any indication, the team has nothing to say in regards to a PC version. \nFinal Fantasy XVI hits PlayStation 5 on June 22. While waiting for more information, watch this \"Ambition\" trailer that reveals more about Valisthea's kingdoms, dominants, and eikons, and then check out our interview with Yoshida about the game's boss fights. \n[Source: Eurogamer]\nAre you picking up Final Fantasy XVI on PS5 or waiting for the rumored PC release?

          "description": "Don't expect The Last of Us HBO show to extend beyond the story of the two games in the series. That's because The Last of Us game director Neil Druckmann says there are no plans for stories beyond the games in this show.\nThis news comes by way of a new interview with Druckmann from The Hollywood Reporter, as reported by GameSpot. Here's what Druckmann told THR specifically: \"We have no plans to tell any stories beyond adapting the games. We won't run into the same issue as Game of Thrones since The Last of Us Part: II doesn't end on a cliffhanger.\" \n\n\nDruckmann and TV series writer Craig Mazin have mentioned that a second season of this show might cover the events of The Last of Us Part II (personally, I think The Last of Us Part II could cover two seasons of television). Despite the duo not wanting the show to go beyond the games, there might be a way for the show to cover more ground after the events of The Last of Us Part II. If Naughty Dog were to develop a theoretical The Last of Us Part III, it wouldn't be surprising if the HBO show covered that down the road. Chances seem pretty good considering Druckmann told THR that there is \"more story to tell\" in the world of The Last of Us games. \nMazin also touched on his desire not to extend the show beyond the games in the THR interview, as noted by GameSpot, stating that he doesn't \"have any interest in a spinning-plates-go-on-forever show.\" \n\"When it becomes a perpetual motion machine, it just can't help but get kind of...stupid,\" he continued. \"Endings mean everything to me.\" \nFor more about The Last of Us on HBO, read our interview with Joel actor Pedro Pascal and Druckmann about the changes made for this TV show. Check out this new piece of concept art from The Last of Us multiplayer game that Naughty Dog is currently developing after that. \n[Source: GameSpot via The Hollywood Reporter]\nWhat scene are you most excited to see in The Last of Us on HBO?

But perhaps more than any property that has moved from interactive medium to passive television, The Last of Us seems most suited to make the transition. Joel and Ellie’s story is an emotional and cinematic one that does not rely on player choice.\nAhead of the show’s premiere we spoke with some of the actors about the adaptation, as well as Neil Druckmann, co-creator of The Last of Us, who was heavily involved in writing the show and directed a few episodes.\nDruckmann is no stranger to directing actors, even if the recording process of a TV show is different from how it works in a video game. “There is a certain luxury we have in video games that when we capture a performance, we have eve…",

You get Gravity Circuit, a promising indie action title launching later this year. \nPlayers control Kai, a lone warrior battling an evil robotic army in a post-apocalyptic world. This side-scrolling action title boasts plenty of satisfying action thanks to Kai’s fun melee combat, nimble platforming abilities, and his signature grappling hook, which he uses to traverse levels as well as yank and toss enemies. Sporting great 16-bit art and a strong soundtrack, Gravity Circuit is worth keeping an eye on for fans of classic throwbacks. \nJoin editors Wesley LeBlanc and Marcus Stewart as they explore Gravity Circuit’s free Steam demo and discuss why it may be one of the year’s most exciting indie gems.\n\n\nFor more previews of some of the biggest games of 2022 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for NGTs about Fire Emblem Engage, Clive 'N' Wrench, Inkulinati, Outer Terror, and more.",

That story is about the GT Academy contest, which was a real contest held between 2008 and 2016 by Sony and Nissan. Winners were given entrance into Nissan's Driver Development Program, as noted by Video Games Chronicle. The film appears to be telling the tale of someone who won entrance into this program and then went on to become a real success in the racing world. \nCheck out the Gran Turismo sneak peek for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, this sneak peek is a mix of what appears to be movie footage and behind-the-scenes footage, with stars like Harbour, Barnet, and Bloom talking about their excitement for the film. \nGran Turismo hits theaters later this year on August 11. \nAlongside this sneak peek, Sony also revealed that Gran Turismo 7, the latest in the long-running series released last year, will be getting an update that makes the game playable on its upcoming PSVR2 platform. \nWhile waiting to learn more about this Gran Turismo movie, read about Project Leonardo, a new customizable accessibility controller kit PlayStation unveiled yesterday and then read about how the PlayStation 5 has surpassed 30 million units sold. \nAre you excited about this Gran Turismo movie?

In addition to the HBO adaptation premiering on January 15 and the PC port of The Last of Us Part 1 hitting in March, Druckmann states fans will learn more about the long-awaited multiplayer experience that serves as a follow-up to the original game’s Factions mode. Druckmann writes,\n“We’ll have some fun surprises for you along the way, but later this year we will begin to offer you some details on our ambitious The Last of Us multiplayer game. With a team led by Vinit Agarwal, Joe Pettinati, and Anthony Newman, the project is shaping up to be a fresh, new experience from our studio, but one rooted in Naughty Dog’s passion for delivering incredible stories, characters, and gameplay.”\nNaughty Dog also shares a new piece of concept art, posted in full below, which is the first new material of the game since it released the first concept asset last June. It depicts two survivors heading toward a dilapidated cruise ship. \nThough we’ll be learning more about the game this year, it’s still unknown if Naughty Dog plans to launch it in 2023. That would be fitting given the anniversary, but we'll have to wait and see over the coming months.

News of this change follows the release of Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance's release last year, which didn't fare too well with critics and players, amidst Larian Studios' continued development on Baldur's Gate 3 (which does not seem to be affected by this reorganization despite WotC serving as the game's publisher). \nThese two games, in part, represented WotC's bigger forray into the video game space as Bloomberg reports that the company had signed contracts with several studios to make games. WotC also \"built at least six of its own game studios,\" according to the publication. \nOne project in the works that is now canceled went under the codename \"Jabberwocky,\" according to Bloomberg, and two more externally developed games early in development are no longer moving forward as well. These cancelations and layoffs comes as parent company Hasbro's shares fell 40% last year. \nWotc told IGN that it remains \"committed to using digital games as a cornerstone of our strategy for bringing our games to players around the world,\" adding that it has \"made some changes to our long-term portfolio to focus on games which are strategically aligned with developing our existing brands and those which show promise in expanding or engaging our audience in new ways.\" \n[Source: Bloomberg]",

Double-click on her door to open it, and step inside. Riddenbutter works the bar, and the smart traveler should speak with her. Drop an idea on her to get her chatting. Like most people, she likes to talk about this and that and the other thing, and she’ll also frequently respond with information that’s more local in nature.\nYes, the ScummVM team announces support for Halls of the Dead: Faery Tale Adventure II, a marvellous work by our GSoC’21 student Yuri Guimaraes aka a-yyg, who ported the original SAGA2 engine from 1997 by The Dreamers Guild.\nPlease assist us with testing this game. Take your old dusty CD and feed it to the ScummVM. As usual, you will need the latest daily build of ScummVM. If you encounter any bugs or problems during your gameplay, please file them on our issue tracker.\n>",
