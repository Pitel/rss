It's a cult simulator, but with cute li'l woodland animals instead of bloodthirsty human-types or Cthulhuses (although you can get a Cthulhu skin as part of a pre-order bonus, actually), making all the ritual sacrifice and cannibalism look so cuuuuuuuute.\nThat combination of cutesy and culty is the culmination of many, many months prototyping and flinging ideas at the wall in Massive Monster HQ, but now that the game is out, it's receiving reviews that make all that work worthwhile (our review is coming soon, don't worry — PC codes were sent out earlier than Switch ones!).\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

You will play as Reik, a well-respected member of the fox tribe who journeys across a fantastical land inhabited by a host of different animals.

That's right, £7.99 (or €9.99 in the ol' Eurozone) for three of the best shooters on Switch or anywhere else for that matter.

          "description": "Not a wash out.\nHave you ever wanted to turn your local laundromat into an arcade? For the three of you that have, boy do we have a game to recommend you. Created by Nosebleed Interactive, the same developer behind the well-received Vostok Inc., Arcade Paradise puts you in the role of Ashley, an inheritor to a run-down laundromat called King Wash. Tucked away in the backroom are a handful of arcade cabinets that Ashley soon realises could earn much more cash than laundering dirty clothes. Problem is, Ashley’s father – voiced Geralt of Riviera himself, Doug Cockle – has little faith in the arcade business, leaving Ashley to prove him wrong by buying new arcade games with the laundromat’s profits, slowly turning it into the hottest gaming spot the sleepy town of Grindstone has ever seen.\nWhile this might not sound like the most exciting premise, Arcade Paradise has a couple of things going for it. First, the gameplay loop of managing a laundromat – transferring clothes between washers and dryers, picking up garbage, removing gum, unclogging the toilet – draws from other simulation games like Stardew Valley. You only have a limited time each day to get everything done before closing up, so time management becomes paramount. Pulling clothes from a dryer as quickly as possible awards you higher score, which comes with more profits to buy arcade cabinets with. And the cleaner the laundromat, the more people willing to spend money on the arcade games tucked away in the back, thus earning more money for more cabinets.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

I even played Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions, which had four different web-dudes and later inspired the Spider-Verse storyline in the comics. Point is, I'm standing on pretty solid ground to judge Spider-Man games. Marvel's Spider-Man, originally released onto Sonyboxes in 2018, is finally coming to PC in a Remastered form, and let me tell you: it is a great Spidey game.\r\n\nYou know Spider-Man. He's a dude named Peter Parker who was bitten by a radioactive spider and can now climb up walls and punch criminals really well. Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered lets you roleplay being Spidey against the backdrop of a big, living New York city. It is, if you'll excuse the pun, amazing. Now, is it the best Spidey game? Nah. I reckon that's its spin-off/sequel Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, but that's not on PC yet. This means Marvel's Spider-Man gets to be the best wall-crawler game on PC for another few months, which isn't a bad consolation prize. \nRead more",

By my understanding the Steam Deck is basically just a PS4 with a screen slapped on it, so surely portable Spider-Manning wasn't an unrealistic thing to expect?\nAfter spending a few days testing out the game on the Deck I'm thrilled to confirm that Spider-Man Remastered plays great on Valve's handheld with only a few very minor caveats. Hooray! I can finally punch a Vulture in my back garden without getting shouted at by local bird protection services. What a time to be alive.\nRead more",

Katharine wakes up and immediately sets to work cleaning up the mountains of poop and vomit puddles left over from the previous night's revelries. As she works, she spies her good friend Alice B harvesting cauliflowers from the cult's garden, trying to keep as far as possible away from the (now slightly rotting) corpse of Graham that lays nearby. A cluster of other followers are busy dancing around a shrine in the centre of the village, but they all stop to witness a fight between the two oldest members of the cult - Alice0 and Liam. Ritual combat of the elderly is a staple of CultPaperShotgun, and as Alice0 delivers the final blow to an ailing Liam, cries of euphoria reverberate about the camp as his spirit (and chunks of flesh) are donated to the cause.\nWhere am I in all this, you ask? I, the Lamb, the glorious leader of our cult, the holy vessel of Death itself, and the sworn enemy of the Bishops of the Old Faith that are destined soon to die by my blade? I'm kicking back at a nearby camp, enjoying a spot of fishing and a friendly game of Knucklebones.\nThis, friends, is Cult Of The Lamb. And it is excellent.\nRead more",

Its vibrant cartoon visuals immediately caught my attention when I first sampled its Steam Next Fest demo earlier in the year, and I'm happy to report that the full game, out today, is just as captivating as it was back then. \nIt tells the tale of Toto and Gal, a pair of rambunctious siblings who end up far from home after getting lost inside a fantasy world of their own imagining. If they don't find a way back before nightfall, though, they'll be stuck there forever. A classic kids adventure story, in other words, but one that really relishes in its own sense of playfulness. Over the course of their four-odd hour adventure, they'll meet monster fighting frogs in a dark forest, board game-playing seagulls on the high seas, orc mechanics in a vast desert and even a heavy-metal loving sheep on a floating island in the sky as they make their way home  to their messy childhood bedroom. It all makes for some memorable puzzling backdrops, but be warned: if you're planning to play this with little ones, then you'll definitely need a puzzle savvy adult in the mix, as some of its brainteasers aren't quite as child-friendly as you might expect.\nRead more",

All he wants to do is study clouds: their different formations, their flight paths, their properties, everything.  He can’t get enough of them, and finds them fascinating enough to be the subject of his 100-page PhD thesis. It’s a poetic subject and one that matches his temperament as a boyish and awkward researcher and 'path of least resistance' kinda guy. But around him the world is spiralling from the political tensions of the Cold War, and as much as Peter wishes to escape to in the clouds, current events are keeping him firmly tethered to the realities of an impending war. \nIt’s this tension that makes South Of The Circle such an engrossing story. With player choices that subtly tug the game’s narrative needle in ways you might not expect, it's clear skies and fair winds for the game’s three-hour journey. But with an abrupt ending after a calculated slow-burn drama, it's a rough landing.\nRead more",

          "description": "I don't spend a ton of time testing gaming laptops these days, but one of my recent favourites was the Zephyrus G14. This laptop is slim and compact, yet sports a brilliant 14-inch 2560x1600 120Hz display, a powerful RX 6700S graphics card and a top-end Ryzen 9 6900HS processor. This is backed with a 1TB NVMe SSD and 16GB of DDR5 RAM (!!), an impressive loadout that uses basically the fastest and latest-gen components you can fit into a laptop of this size. \nToday Best Buy in the US are doing a great price on this spec of the Zephyrus G14, charging $1399.99 for it rather than the launch price of $1649.99 - a $250 reduction. That's the best price we've seen for this model and an awesome deal on a compact yet powerful all-AMD laptop.\nRead more",

After seeing discounts on AMD's first 6000-series graphics cards last month, we're now also seeing deep cuts to the more recent 6X50 models - including the subject of this piece, the Radeon RX 6950 XT. This particular card is the very fastest that AMD make, and offers rasterised performance on par with Nvidia's RTX 3090 and 3090 Ti.\nToday, it's been discounted to £850 at Scan, a big reduction from its original UK RRP of £1065 earlier this year. \nRead more",

          "description": "Is it lazy to describe Turbo Golf Racing as ‘Rocket League if the cars were playing golf instead of football?' A bit, yes. But it’s also largely accurate. Up to eight players race across a track, ramming their boost-enabled car into their huge futuristic golf ball to send it flying forwards until (depending on your skill or luck) it flies/rolls/plops anticlimactically into the big hole at the end. It’s golf, sort of, but fast, demanding, and often unpredictable. You don’t even have to wear silly trousers while playing it, but that’s just my personal choice.\nOf course, it’s not quite so simple as hitting your ball forward and relying on the videogame gods to deem your ball worthy of reaching the goal before everybody else’s. There are 30 courses of varying length and complexity, and none of them are a simple drag race to the end. There are ramps, twists, turns, and plenty of obstacles. While the very shortest courses are pretty frictionless (I’ve won a few in under 20 seconds), the longest ones are practically begging you to make agonising mistakes.\nRead more",

          "description": "My exposure to summer camps is entirely through films and games. Summer camp culture isn't as much of a thing in the UK, possibly because we're fairly happy to allow our children to learn to tie knots by themselves, by affixing each other to disused railway tracks or sick trees. In any case, the summer camps I've seen portrayed are usually unwholesome ones, because they're good horror fodder. Camp Canyonwood is a camp counsellor sim, out now in early access, where you (an bird) look after a flock of demanding smaller birds. It sounds like it would be twee, except the owner is cutting corners and you dream about a talking jackalope. I have not explored these aspects much because I am constantly trying to feed the children.\nRead more",

Laughing Deer is a six-foot man of raw muscle and rage, a native American warrior with shoulders like a pair of yoked oxen and a personality best described as \"barely contained\". Unlike the rest of his posse, which includes a cowboy without a shadow, a woman with ties to the occult, and one very stubborn corpse, Laughing Deer doesn't really \"do\" guns. While his compatriots are all crouched behind crates, ricocheting bullets off buckets and wheelbarrows to hit enemies from behind, Laughing Deer is getting in their faces (shortly before his club gets significantly further into their faces).\nNow, bringing a club to a gunfight might not seem like the smartest idea. But while pistols require two of a gunslinger's action points to shoot, and rifles take all three, it only takes one action point to whack some neckerchief-wearing bandit with a big ol' stick. And Laughing Deer whacks a whole point of damage harder than normal, meaning he can rush foes and nail them into the ground with a couple of hard swings before they can pull the trigger. Better yet, killing an enemy completely refills a character's action points in Hard West, meaning that, when set up right, Laughing Deer can ping around the battlefield like a weaponised pinball. \nRead more",

Lonely Mountains is a collection of little adventures, each leading to your tent at the end of the day. Delightful.\nRead more",

Normally this laptop retails for £1500, but thanks to an Ebay code (AUG15) you can take £60 off.

The studio's had a fair bit of experience working on fighting games, and it shows in Rumbleverse.\nThe 40-person grappler royale has players rush throughout a city, grabbing special magazines full of moves to then employ against other players. Melee weapons like bats and chairs are also in the mix, of course.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suOmxeeyRsI\nThere's a standard battle royale mode, or Solo Mode, as well as a recently revealed Duos Mode where players can team up. There's also a Playground Mode, which will let users explore Grapital City at their own place. It's kind of like the training room equivalent, for this wide world of wrestling.\nTotal knockout\nRumbleverse is free-to-play as well, and it has crossplay enabled. You can also form cross-platform parties for Duos, though you'll need to add each other through the Epic Games Launcher to make that happen. The FAQ on Iron Galaxy's site has an easy-to-follow rundown for how to make that happen.\nWhile the game launches today, its first season kicks off next week on August 18, with a Battle Pass available for purchase then. There are also special bundles for Rumbleverse, if you want to start out with some extra cosmetics and shop bucks.\nFortnite may potentially be getting Goku, but for those who really want to brawl, seems like Rumbleverse is a solid option. It's out now on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC via Epic.\nThe post Grappler royale Rumbleverse officially launches off the top rope today appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Locked 'n' Loaded\nWarner Bros. Games has released another character trailer for its upcoming open-world actioner Gotham Knights. Following on from previous showcases on Robin, Nightwing, and Batgirl, this new trailer takes a look at the brutal, no-nonsense, gun-toting style of perhaps Gotham's most dangerous vigilante, Red Hood.\nAs a former Robin and close confidant of The Dark Knight himself, Jason Todd learned his master's ways in the art of close combat, stealth tactics, and precise detective work. However, following his death at the hands of The Joker and subsequent resurrection in the Lazarus Pit, Todd returned with a much shorter fuse, a deeper hatred of criminality, and an immensely more brutal approach to the concept of crime-fighting. While still a staunch ally of The Bat Family, Todd typically walks alone, perpetually on the razor-thin line of becoming the very thing he hates most.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDGtXujeQfM\nLacking the finesse of his Gotham Knights brethren, Red Hood brings core strength and ranged dominance to the party, taking down foes with bone-breaking close-quarters-combat and an array of firearms-based abilities. What he lacks in grace, Todd makes up for in raw power and earnest brutality. Unequipped with grapple abilities, Todd is able to traverse the high points of the city via air-bending skills powered by his trip to the Lazarus Pit. When the acrobatics of Nightwing or the precision of Batgirl cannot get the job done, Red Hood is here as your Mack Truck — the Knights' terrifying battering ram.\nHilariously, we are assured Todd is \"non-lethal\" in Gotham Knights, despite his rat-a-tat-tat actions.\nGotham Knights launches October 25 on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X.\nThe post Red Hood is back with a vengeance in Gotham Knights appeared first on Destructoid.",

After a ton of rumors, chatter, and speculation, it looks like Dragon Ball is arriving in Fortnite.\nThe Fortnite Twitter account posted this ominous image of Shenron, the wish-granting dragon, today. \"Speak,\" it says. \"Name your wish...\"\nAs for now, it's not clear what exactly this entails. More info looks to be arriving next week, on August 16.\nhttps://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1557728549737443336\nSpeculation has run rampant over Dragon Ball arriving in Fortnite for a while. The leaker community around Epic's battle royale discovered a bunch of files that pointed towards skins and cosmetics, even including the Capsule Corp logo.\nRock the dragon\nAs for who's up, I think an obvious answer would be Goku. The same way you can't do Naruto and not include the major players, Goku and likely Vegeta are sound bets. I'd like some less obvious characters too, like Piccolo, Bulma, or Yamcha, but those would probably be relegated to a second pack, much like some of the Naruto options were.\nI'm hoping for some kind of in-game event as well, whether it's another special map like the Hidden Leaf Village or possibly an in-game happening. King Kai willing, we get a Kamehameha weapon.\nBut I have to say, seeing some Dragon Ball content drop in Fortnite sounds pretty exciting. Growing up on Toonami instilled quite a bit of nostalgia for the series in me, and it was doubled, maybe even tripled, with the love letter that is Dragon Ball FighterZ.\nSo yes, I'm quite looking forward to August 16 and whatever it entails. Hopefully we'll all be able to finally learn who would win in a fight, John Cena or Goku. We'll just have to wait until next week to get that much closer to our answer.\nThe post Looks like Dragon Ball is coming to Fortnite appeared first on Destructoid.",

Dotemu and Leikir Studio's Metal Slug Tactics is delayed, and now aiming for a 2023 launch.\nIn a statement on social media today, Dotemu says the team needs a little extra time.\n\"Marco, Eri, Fio, and Tarma are tinkering away to make Metal Slug Tactics as explosive as possible on release, but the squad needs a bit more time in the shop to prepare for the battles ahead.

Made in partnership with SNK, the game's a collaboration between Leikir Studio and well-known makers of arcade-style games and retro revivals, Dotemu.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqF0KLsaf6U\nThe new Tactics entry will follow Marco and the gang through battle after battle. It's got the distinct Metal Slug look, but from an isometric, Into the Breach-style perspective. Metal Slug Tactics will also apparently have some perks and skill trees to work with, though we haven't seen too much of the actual game at this point. The project's been largely quiet, aside from a trailer or two.\nI've dumped countless quarters into Metal Slug machines over the years, and I'm a big fan of tactics games, so I'm primed to dig this one. Dotemu has built up some goodwill over the years too. While I was hoping to get hands-on with Metal Slug Tactics this year, we've not been hurting for good strategy games in 2022 anyways.

Amid commentary from in-universe characters, this six-minute Saints Row trailer walks you through the core concepts: creating your criminal empire, and exploring Santo Ileso. Even if you aren't interested in the story at all, the trailer does a pretty good job of showcasing general mechanics, like the customization options, side mission activities, and modes of locomotion (including gliding).\nIt'll be really interesting to see the audience reaction here. Based on my prior hands-on I really dig the world map, but the general vibe and tone are going to hit differently depending on what kind of Saints Row fan you are. After all, the series has kind of been all over the place on that front, and it's really hard to top the prior \"aliens/superpowers/hell\" combo.

          "description": "New stages, new catalog and weapons every three months, and X battle and league battle\nPost-launch, Nintendo is doling out Splatoon 3 free updates, just like they have with prior games in the series. They said as much in the Nintendo Direct this week, but thanks to a Nintendo UK tweet, have more details on what they're actually doing with the threequel.\nAs expected, we're getting a new catalog of items and weapons every three months. During the Direct, Nintendo explained that like prior games, the world of Splatoon will be shifting and evolving over time, especially when it comes to style. Hence, a new set of threads and other outfits will be introduced alongside weapon rotations (kind of like Fortnite and other shooters). New stages are also going to be part of that plan, adding onto the 12 stages that will be present at launch. Nintendo also promises battle and league battle updates.\nGet ready to get sucked back into Splatoon 3 for a while\nThere's also the strong possibility that the card game mode could be updated as well, on top of Salmon Run. At this point, Splatoon 3 has quite a bit to do, and for me, the card game was the tipping point. I mean odds are you probably won't dig every mode in Splatoon, but now with more of them thrown at you, it'll be hard to deny the siren's song of all of them. Plus, that three-team Splatfest concept sounds like it'll be pure chaos.\nhttps://twitter.com/NintendoUK/status/1557357490228150273\nThe post Nintendo details exactly what Splatoon 3 free post-launch updates entail appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Hot ninja tag-team action\nWarner Bros. has released a new trailer for the next installment in its animated movie series Mortal Kombat Legends. Headed to Blu-ray and streaming services at some point in the future, Snow Blind is the third film in the series, following 2020's Scorpion's Revenge and 2021's Battle of the Realms.\nSnow Blind will focus on one of MK's most noble heroes, the blind swordsman Kenshi, presenting the origins of the martial arts master's journey to be one of the most feared and most formidable foes to anybody on a Wi-Fi connection. We will learn of Kenshi's sight loss, and see his rigorous training to hone the mysterious and supernatural skills harnessed within him. Kenshi will then sally forth against an oppressive alliance of Black Dragon villains, led by the self-appointed King Kano.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvqx3-1G9Rw&t\nThe film will chart Kenshi's rise to martial arts mastery, and see him unleash his newfound powers on a bevy of MK villains, including Black Dragon members Kabal, Kira, Erron Black, and even the poor-man's-Ken, Kobra. The odds are against him, but it seems Kenshi isn't alone, with a particularly icy ally waiting in the wings. Snow Blind will feature all of the melodrama and R-rated, blood-gushing action of the previous films, and it's cool to see some of the more forgotten '00s characters get some time in the spotlight.\nMortal Kombat Legends: Snow Blind will premiere on Blu-ray and streaming services in the future. The two previous films — Scorpion's Revenge and Battle of the Realms — are both available now.\nThe post Snow Blind is the next installment in the Mortal Kombat Legends series appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The full performance is on YouTube\nNintendo said that a Kirby 30th Anniversary Music Fest stream was coming (with a live audience in Japan) and it's here! You can watch it below.\nThe stream actually debuted on YouTube roughly four hours ago in the US morning of August 11, and the entire thing is available to watch now from start to finish. The crew goes through the entire series with a wide variety of instruments, and the stream occasionally has a box in the corner to showcase what's on-screen (typically gameplay of the level/scene involved, as is common with many video game live concerts) while the camerawork zooms in and out on the musicians.\nLike the Sonic stream before it, it's a fun little way to spend an afternoon, especially if you've been missing live music (as a small note, the dialogue is in Japanese, outside of Kirby very cutely saying \"bye bye\" at the end). Honestly? We need more of these! The Genshin Impact team has done a pretty good job of keeping this dream alive, but more publishers getting involved is a good thing. Especially if it actually has 30 years of history to draw upon like the Kirby 30th Anniversary Music fest.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJoBSUoZjpw\nThe post You can watch the entire Kirby 30th Anniversary Music Fest for free here appeared first on Destructoid.",

I'm cautiously optimistic for some parts of it. But now it's time for Forspoken's quippy dialogue to really face the music.\nA lot of prospective fans have been waffling on the dialogue since it was announced, which can definitely teeter into the realm of overly-edgy. A new tweet this week from Square Enix, which showcased some gameplay and reminded us of the January 2023 release date, didn't instill much confidence that things have improved.\nAlright, so here's the official Forspoken tweet:\nhttps://twitter.com/Forspoken/status/1556679378892898306\n\"So let me get this straight\"\n\"I'm seeing freaking dragons\"\n\"And oh yeah I'm talking to a cuff\"\n\"Yeah OK that is something I do now!\"\nIt's essentially a 2022 version of \"record scratch: so you're probably wondering how I got myself into this situation,\" right? While the narrative can still deliver, I'm not sure I can stand to listen to the constant quips. And this is before the game is out!\nVarious content creators have taken to roasting the promo, including the following choice videos:\nhttps://twitter.com/ProZD/status/1557070013336395777\nhttps://twitter.com/bobvids/status/1557164035250032641\nAt what point do people slide down the volume on Forspoken's quippy dialogue?

They were the most impractical of ways to play games. They were expensive, noisy, and sometimes just plain broken. However, I feel that an arcade cabinet gives its game a life of its own. This is Metal Slug. It lives in this bowling alley. Not a chunk of plastic on the wall, but a living monolith. Gosh, I even miss the Cruis’n USA that was in Pizza Hut.\nIt’s funny that the last safe place to experience an arcade is within a video game itself.

          "description": "It's out this summer\nKirby's Dream Buffet was just announced this morning, without a Nintendo Direct or anything! It's a four-player game that's set to release \"this summer,\" and will feature a core focus of racing through obstacle courses.\nSince it's all the info we have at the moment, here's the full rundown of Kirby's Dream Buffet from Nintendo:\n\"Roll through a smorgasbord of food-themed stages in 4 rounds of 4-player fun as Kirby…who seems rounder than usual? Race through delicious obstacle courses to collect strawberries as Kirby grows. Then, turn the tides in the final round—a fruity fight atop a floating platform. Roll through delicious, food-themed obstacle courses in 4-player matches Collect strawberries to grow bigger and prepare for the final battle. Kirby’s Dream Buffet offers easy-to-understand gameplay for players of all skill levels, but also presents a healthy challenge for those looking to satiate their craving for friendly competition.\"\n\nLocal and online play are in, but note the proviso for local multiplayer, right on the game's official site: \"Additional games and systems required for multiplayer mode. Sold separately.\"\nYou can find the Kirby's Dream Buffet listing here. That makes two Kirby games this year! Typically the fluff ball manages to knock out a ton of spinoffs these days, so this isn't as big of a surprise, but it's a welcome one regardless. I'm getting a sort of Kirby's Dream Course vibe with the rolling around, and it seems like there's a bit of Fall Guys influence there too.\n[Update: Nintendo has confirmed a relatively-surprise-oriented-drop for Kirby's Dream Buffet today on August 11, as it will be arriving in less than a week on August 17. It's priced at $14.99.]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOGQv0hJNJ8\nThe post Nintendo just announced Kirby’s Dream Buffet, a new multiplayer Kirby game (Update) appeared first on Destructoid.",

In hopes of avoiding the utter chaos of 2019's event, the outlet has now opened its timeslot reservation service for interested parties.\nIf you are looking to visit The Pokémon Center London next week, then head on over to the reservation website right now and book your attendance slot. You'll need to know what day and time you will arrive, as well as how many people will be in your group. This somewhat strict system is a necessity, given that the previous pop-up store appearance drew daily queues of over five hours, with over 30,000 customers walking the floor in a mere five days.\nhttps://twitter.com/PokemonNewsUK/status/1557643837538975744?s=20&t=zoUr61e24OIWVaKlC9YLSQ\nThe new Pokémon Center London is being established in conjunction with the Pokémon World Championships, which are being held at London's ExCel Centre between August 17-21. The store will feature a bonanza of Pokémon toys, accessories, and associated junk, along with photo opportunities and special themed areas. For this year's event, the center exclusives are cute plushies of Pikachu and Roserade in Beefeater outfits, (the official uniforms of the guards at the Tower of London). These toys will, unsurprisingly, sell in double-quick time, so move fast.\nIf you want to just turn up on the day, that's fine too, as you will be assigned a slot in a virtual queuing system. But, given the popularity of the store, the merch on offer, and the fact that all of the hardcore Pokeheads will be in town for the tournament, it is best advised that you pre-book your reservation today.\nThe Pokémon World Championships kick off at London ExCel August 17.\nThe post The Pokemon Center London is now taking visitor reservations appeared first on Destructoid.",

The upcoming game has an introductory demo live now on digital storefronts for PC and console.\nThe demo kicks off right at the opening of the game, and up through the first chapter. Save progress will carry over from the demo into the full version of The DioField Chronicle.\nYou can find it here on the PlayStation Store for PS4 and PS5, the Microsoft store for Xbox Series X|S and One, on the eShop for Nintendo Switch, and on PC via Steam.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16eW4pAJUKU\nThe DioField Chronicle is a strategy RPG following a band of mercenaries, caught up in the war and machinations of the politicians around them. A core group of heroes tries to navigate shady dealings and plots while trying to effect change for the better, especially on the island nation of DioField.\nKeeping three moves ahead\nI got the chance to check out The DioField Chronicle early, and played this section in particular. You can find my full impressions here, but I came away surprised by how different it felt.\nThis year is not exactly wanting for tactical RPGs, with new entries like Triangle Strategy and the revival of classics like Tactics Ogre and Front Mission providing ample fodder for strategy fans. The DioField Chronicle stands out by taking a real-time strategy spin on the RPG concept, allowing units to move in real-time on the field.\nMix in some interesting class variations and some tight, well-designed arenas to fight in, and it all works pretty well. The player can even retreat to a home base and chat with allies, build up base buildings, and purchase upgrades, in a very Fire Emblem: Three Houses manner.\nIf you like a little strategy mixed into your RPG, it's worth giving a shot. The DioField Chronicle demo is out now, and the full game is out on September 22.\nThe post The DioField Chronicle demo is out now on PC and consoles appeared first on Destructoid.",

And one returning mode from Splatoon 2 is getting a few big upgrades, including one major one: it's available any time, all the time.\nFor those who played Splatoon 2, you'll remember that the co-op Salmon Run mode was a timed event. Special windows would be open only at set times to play the PvE mode.\nWell, according to the Splatoon site, Splatoon 3's Salmon Run mode is available any time. So yes, that means you won't have to set a time and date for those part-time jaunts into Salmonid territory.\nDuring today's Direct, we also got a look at a few of the special enemies that will be causing problems for the Golden Egg collectors. These Boss Salmonids have special moves and weaknesses, like the barrier-popping, lid-dropping Slammin' Lid. Or the mortar-launching Big Shot, who seems like a big problem if left unattended.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiuIZN0KDFQ\nThese new bosses add a little extra challenge, and on top of that, there are King Salmonids. According to today's Direct, this special event can sometimes occur at the end of a job. You have to do as much damage as possible within a time limit to drive back the big bad, using special Golden Egg Cannons.\nThe Big Run is another special event that occurs once \"every few months,\" where Salmonids invade the city. Functionally, it looks like that means playing Salmon Run on regular Splatoon maps. It looks pretty exciting, but there is one update that's big for any Salmon Run fan.\nDon't stop me now\nEven more was shown off during today's Splatoon 3 Direct, including new amiibo coming this holiday season and a special card game mode that's being added to the action. It looks like next month is going to be one heck of a dive back into the inky world of Splatoon.\nSplatoon 3 will launch on September 9 for the Nintendo Switch.\nThe post Splatoon 3’s Salmon Run can be played at any time appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "GTA and Breaking Bad would be a match made in heaven\nBreaking Bad is widely regarded as one of the best TV series of all time, and frankly, its subject matter would make for a great game. The show's creator Vince Gilligan thought so too, because he at one point pitched a GTA-like adaptation of the iconic series. Originally reported by ComicBook, Gilligan expressed the interest he had in turning Breaking Bad into a game on a recent episode of his podcast \"Inside The Gilliverse,\" where he was accompanied by Eric Broadbent and Peter Gould.\nGilligan said that he's \"not much of a video game player,\" but that he wanted to reach out to the studio that owns Grand Theft Auto and see if they could make \"like a module\" inspired by his series. Even for someone who doesn't know games all that well, he might be onto something with a Breaking Bad x GTA DLC.\n\"There have been quite a few attempts at video games,\" Gilligan continued. \"Some of them kinda sort of made it to market. We tried to do a VR experience with the Sony PlayStation VR headset. We did a mobile game that lasted for a little while.\" He's referring to a narrative base-builder game that was released back in 2020 called Breaking Bad: Criminal Elements, but it didn't last longer than a year.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVpGPX_Lj64&t=3069s\nGilligan also shared the sentiment that the team behind Breaking Bad didn't want to create a bad game that only drew players because of its association with the show, specifically referencing the colossal failure of the 1982 E.T. game for the Atari as something they wanted to avoid replicating.\nI honestly find it impressive that conversations are still swirling about adapting Breaking Bad into a game — it speaks to the legacy the show has built nearly a decade after it went off the air.\nThe post Breaking Bad creator wanted a game adaptation in the style of GTA appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "One more round for Street Fighter V\nWithout hyperbole, it's safe to say that Evo 2022 was a huge success — perhaps one of the greatest editions of the Evolution Championship Series ever, in fact. Returning in a physical capacity for the first time in years, fighting game fans were treated to hundreds of exciting matchups, some quality presentation, a fistful of exciting reveals, updates, and announcements, and some amazing in-ring action.\nAnd the good times are set to continue, as it has been officially announced that Evo will be returning not only to western shores in 2023, but also in the east, as Evo Japan makes its own grand stage return next spring. The Japanese iteration of the event will take place at Tokyo Big Sight in Odaiba, Tokyo, for the weekend of March 31 — April 2. While a full card is yet to be announced, Arc System Works' Guilty Gear Strive, SNK's The King of Fighters XV, Bandai Namco's Tekken 7, and Capcom's Street Fighter V: Champion Edition are all confirmed to be in attendance.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9I0GG0UR-k\nThe appearance of SFV on the main card is something of a curiosity, given that Capcom is looking at a spring 2023 release for its successor, Street Fighter 6. The Industry's Chris Moyse is still betting on a February release, but one would imagine that such a launch date (March at the latest) would be just a tad too late to see the new fighter headline the Evo Japan card. Still, it's quite clear that Capcom will want SF6 out in plenty of time to qualify for next year's Evo USA, so the predicted date still stands.\nEvo Japan will return in March 2023. Be sure to check out all of the fighting game headlines from the past weekend over in our round-up guide right here.\nThe post EVO Japan will return to Tokyo March-April 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Publisher Dotemu has announced that the tactical spin-off of the popular shoot 'em up needs more time to come together and will launch in 2023.\nThe tweet, embedded below, doesn’t elaborate more than that. We haven't heard much of a peep about the game since its reveal last summer, making us wonder if a delay was on the horizon.\nMarco, Eri, Fio, and Tarma are tinkering away to make #MetalSlugTactics as explosive as possible on release, but the squad needs a bit more time in the shop to prepare for the battles ahead. See you in 2023! @LeikirStudio x @Dotemu\n@AngryangryD pic.twitter.com/JRKqpnvUQp\nAugust 11, 2022\nMetal Slug Tactics was one of the pleasant surprises of E3 2021. The game, developed by Leikir Studio, transforms the series’ explosive run-and-gun action into a tile-based tactics experience that retains Metal Slug’s signature style and tone. Although turn-based, units still wield classic Metal Slug weapons and can be improved by unlocking abilities and perks on a skill tree.\nWe’ll have to wait a while longer to see how well Metal Slug translates to this new template.

The game is the debut by Inflexion Games, a team consisting of former Bioware developers, including ex-general manager Aaron Flynn. \nIn a message posted to Twitter, Inflexion explains it delayed the launch for two reasons. One, it’s migrating the game to Unreal Engine 5. Two, it needs the extra time to ensure it's polished and packed with content before players can begin testing it out. You can read Inflexion's full message below (click the image to enlarge). \nNightingale debuted during The Game Awards 2021 and is a PvE crafting and survival game that can be played alone or in co-op. Players find themselves stranded in a Victorian Gaslamp fantasy world connected by a network of portals. To survive, they’ll have to harvest materials such as wood and ore to construct weapons, equipment, and buildings. Jumping through portals transports players to new biomes such as deserts, swamps, and jungles. Nightingale’s appearance during this year’s Summer Game Fest introduced Realm Cards used to unlock new areas and influence the type of content, such as enemies and resources, they contain. \nSo far, Nightingale is only confirmed to launch for PC via Steam.",

          "description": "Snow Blind, the next installment in the Mortal Kombat Legends animated film series, got its first trailer today ahead of its October release. The new movie tells the origin story of Kenshi, who tags up with Sub-Zero to kombat Outworld's usual suspects and keep the peace (or as peaceful as this universe can get). \nThe film explores how Kenshi loses his eyesight and trains to become the master swordfighter that fans have loved since his debut in Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance. Kenshi’s goal: take down a fully cybernetic Kano and his Black Dragon clan. Kenshi has another ace up his sleeve in the form of a powerful ally (?) in Sub-Zero. Some of the characters that appear include Shang Tsung and Kabal and even lesser seen faces like Tremor and Kira. \n\n\nSnow Blind is the third Mortal Kombat Legends film following 2021’s Battle of the Realms and 2020’s Scorpion’s Revenge. It will be available on digital storefronts on October 9 and on Blu-ray October 11. Personally, I'm excited to see where it winds up landing on my ranking of every Mortal Kombat on-screen adaptation.",

Now we have our best look yet, featuring Persona 5 Royal running at 60 FPS on an Xbox Series X, thanks to Faz on YouTube, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. \nCheck it out for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Persona 5 Royal looks wildly different running at 60 FPS. Personally, and this is shocking for me to say, I think I prefer it running at 30 FPS. I was chatting with a friend about this last night, but the animation of the game and its general art style lend themselves well to 30 FPS. This remastered 60 FPS look almost takes away some of the shine from the game, giving characters and enemies a matte-like finish. Perhaps it will look better in the final release, but right now, I think I will stick to my PlayStation 4 version. \n[Source: Faz on YouTube via Video Games Chronicle]\nWhat do you think of the game running at 60 FPS?

          "description": "Embark Studios, a young team of former DICE employees led by ex-EA head Patrick Söderlund, has delayed its upcoming shooter, Arc Raiders. The title was initially slated to arrive this year but will now launch in 2023. \nThe reason is that the team has decided to pivot and focus on launching another team-based shooter codenamed Project Discovery. A blog post written by Söderlund explains that Embark has several projects in development and that Discovery progressed so quickly that it seemingly caught up to Arc Raiders, presenting the team with the possibility of shipping two games within the same timeframe. However, doing would've been more than the small team can handle. \n“For a young, relatively small studio like ours, releasing two games in short succession would have strained our teams and resources, many of which are shared between the two projects.” Söderlund explains. \n“As such, we decided to let Project Discovery be our studio’s first game to market, pushing Arc Raiders to a 2023 release. It’s a decision that will also allow us to expand and refine the Arc Raiders experience.”\nOutside of being a team-based first-person shooter, little is known about Project Discovery. The concept art posted above hints that it's set in the current day or perhaps the near future. Söderlund promises to reveal more details “very soon.” \nArc Raiders made its debut during the 2021 Game Awards and will be a free-to-play cooperative shooter where players work together to battle mechanical creatures from space. It will launch for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

We already knew additional Sonic-themed costumes were planned for Fall Guys this month, but developer Mediatonic this morning announced the details of the collaboration event with Sega's iconic brand. The event is meant to celebrate over 30 years of Sonic the Hedgehog and includes a new Sonic-themed level and new outfits. \nThe new level is called \"Bean Hill Zone\" and tasks the Fall Guys beans with collecting as many rings as possible to win special rewards. If players earn 200 points, they get a \"Bean Hill Zone\" nameplate. Earning 400 points yields 200 kudos, 600 points get a Bonus Rings Pattern outfit, 800 points gives 400 kudos, and 1,000 points gives you access to Sonic's iconic sneakers.\nThose aren't the only rewards you can snatch up during this event, though. New costumes for Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Super Sonic, and Dr. Robotnik are all available in the store during the event. You can also buy the Sonic Foot Tap emote.\nThis isn't Sonic's first appearance in Fall Guys as a costume. Back in 2020, players could pick up this Sonic costume. This special Fall Guys event featuring Sonic the Hedgehog begins on Thursday, August 11, and runs until Monday, August 15.\nFall Guys originally launched on PlayStation 4 and PC, where it found overwhelming success as a fun gameshow-style twist on the battle royale genre, in 2020. In 2021, publisher Epic Games acquired Fall Guys developer Mediatonic. Earlier this summer, Fall Guys changed from a premium model to a free-to-play model, and launched on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and Switch.",

          "description": "Marvel’s Midnight Suns, the upcoming card-based strategy RPG by Firaxis, as been hit with its second delay. A Take-Two earnings report revealed that the game had been pushed out of its October 7 date to an unspecified release within the 2023 fiscal year. That means it will now arrive sometime before March 31, 2023.\nThe game’s Twitter account confirmed the delay with a message, embedded below, that also revealed that the game will now have a staggered release. Midnight Suns will come to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC first within the fiscal year. The PS4, Xbox One, and Switch versions arrive sometime after that. \nImportant update from the Midnight Suns team pic.twitter.com/79yVfzpDED\nAugust 8, 2022\nWhile Midnight Suns will only face a five-month setback at most (for current-gen, at least) and could technically still arrive in 2022, seeing it suffer another delay is disappointing nonetheless. The game was first announced almost a year ago at last year’s Gamescom. It graced Game Informer’s cover that month and was first scheduled to launch this March before being delayed to October. A reimagining of the Rise of the Midnight Sons comic event, players control a team of occult heroes like Blade, Magik, and Nico Minoru and Avengers like Iron Man, Captain America, and Spider-Man to battle Lilith, the mother of all demons. Midnight Suns' turn-based combat utilizes a card system for selecting commands, and between battles players explore a headquarters where they can socialize and bond with their teammates. \nWe played the first four hours of Marvel’s Midnight Suns in June and wrote up seven takeaways based on our time with it. You can also watch us battle Venom as Spider-Man and other heroes in this episode of New Gameplay Today.",

          "description": "Dragon Ball FighterZ is finally getting rollback netcode by way of the newly announced PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions of the game. The update will also be available on PC.\nFor the unfamiliar, rollback netcode is a system that provides a nearly lag-free online experience, hence why it's always a highly desirable feature in the fighting game community. During EVO 2022, DBFZ producer Tomoko Hiroki shared that the current-gen versions will support rollback netcode, whereas the PS4 and Xbox One editions will not. There's no release window for upgraded ports, but a message from Bandai Namco's Twitter account states we'll learn more information later and that it will take \"some time\" before the system is finished. \nWhile that's bad news for those who don't own a PS5 or Xbox Series X/S, Bandai Namco is at least planning some sort of upgrade path for existing game owners on current consoles (such as Smart Delivery on Xbox). There's no mention if the Switch version will receive a rollback netcode.  \nHiroki also announced that Dragon Ball FighterZ is now content-complete, meaning it will not receive any more fighters or balance updates. The game received three DLC fighter packs during its lifetime that added over a dozen characters to its roster. \nDragon Ball FighterZ first launched in January 2018 and was hailed as one of the best fighting games of the decade and arguably the best Dragon Ball video game period. You can read our review of the launch version of the game here.",

That would make sense; Tekken 7 launched on consoles in 2017, so it feels like the right time to begin hinting at the next entry. Perhaps it’s a different Tekken project entirely.

Check out the announcement for yourself below:\nTune in on August 10 at 6 a.m. PT for a livestreamed #Splatoon3 Direct presentation. Join us in the Splatlands for roughly 30 minutes of updates! pic.twitter.com/iFfaU3V6vM\nAugust 8, 2022\nAs you can see, there’s not much else to glean from this news. If you’re the kind of person who anticipates game-focused Directs to reveal information about other anticipated titles, I would say you should not do that with this one. It seems very much a “we’re only going to talk about Splatoon 3” kind of Direct announcement. Of course, I could be wrong, but you know, expectations and all that. \nHowever, if you’re a Splatoon fan, it sounds like Wednesday will be an excellent day. Not only are you getting new Splatoon 3 details and information, but “roughly 30” minutes of it – that’s a lot! As for what to expect, new weapons, characters, maps, and story details will likely be showcased. This will probably be the last Splatoon 3-focused Direct, too, considering the game hits Switch less than a month after it on Sept. 9. \nWhile waiting for Wednesday’s Direct, check out this Splatoon 3-themed Switch console and then listen to this new punk rock-inspired track from Splatoon 3’s soundtrack. After that, check out the latest Splatoon 3 gameplay trailer. \nAre you excited about Splatoon 3? Let us know in the comments below!",

Hungry wolves back on the prowl. A new destiny hidden in darkness. New Fatal Fury/Garou green-lit.” \nCheck it out for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, SNK didn’t reveal much else, and if you’re a Fatal Fury fan, you probably have many questions. Will this new game adopt a 3D art style like other modern fighting franchises such as Street Fighter 6, or will it stick with traditional 2D art? Which fighters are returning? Will there be new fighters? Only time will tell. \nIf you’re unfamiliar with Fatal Fury, you might recognize the name Terry Bogard, who regained some popularity after his inclusion in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. He’s the protagonist of the Fatal Fury fighting game series. If you don’t recognize that name either, nobody can blame you – the last Fatal Fury game came out 23 years ago, with Fatal Fury: Mark of the Wolves’ release in 1999. \nIt’s unclear when we’ll hear more about this new Fatal Fury game, but it’s nice to know at least a game is in development for the classic fighting franchise. \nAre you excited about a new Fatal Fury game?

She first appeared in Super Street Fighter IV. Before SF6, her primary motivation was exacting revenge on M. Bison, but since his fall in Street Fighter V, she now waits for a new motivation to arrive. If you’re a fan of Juri, don’t sweat – she retains many of her past moves in Street Fighter 6, although you can expect them to have “different properties” now. \nFor example, Fuhajin returns and sees Juri perform an upwards kick that stores Fuha stocks upon completion.

Not only were we asked to play with a substantially smaller library of games than what we had on Wii or Wii U, but I didn't even have the option to buy those games. Instead, we were given a small library of games from a single console with no way to carry over entitlements from previous purchases or actually own the classic games I was playing. I felt Nintendo Switch Online was a worse service in every way, even as Nintendo expanded the offerings to include a robust NES and SNES library.\nThen in 2020, something changed.

          "description": "Saturnalia is an upcoming indie survival horror with one of the most interesting visual styles I’ve seen in the genre in a minute. \nDeveloped by Italy-based studio Santa Ragione, Saturnalia is influenced heavily by the folklore of Sardinia, Italy, and inspired by Italian Giallo horror films (typically more horror-esque mystery thrillers). In it, you control four different characters, all connected through a mysterious storyline that ties back to the “haunting traditions” of an ancient village. \n“The village itself is an elaborate maze with no two iterations being precisely the same – you will have to explore and solve mysteries of the game largely unguided,” the game’s website reads. “Die, and watch the village reconfigure itself into a new form. Solve puzzles and open shortcuts to new areas with tools and items you find along the way, unlocking every piece of the story with different characters, each suited for another aspect of exploration and investigation.” \nAll of that sounds great, but Saturnalia's unique art style makes me most excited. It’s like a mix of stop-motion and sketchbook, which looks like it’ll lend itself nicely to the game's horror elements. Check it out for yourself below:\n\n\nSanta Ragione is the studio behind games like Fotonica, MirrorMoon EP, and Wheels of Aurelia. Saturnalia does not yet a launch date, but it will hit PC exclusively via the Epic Games Store sometime in 2022. The studio is planning to launch the game on other platforms, but the timing on that remains TBA. \nWhat do you think of Saturnalia? Let us know in the comments below!",

While the bundle was praised for bringing Sonic 1, Sonic 2, Sonic 3 & Knuckles, and Sonic CD to modern platforms with various gameplay enhancements and other additions, it was also heavily criticized. Various bugs, mislabeled titles in the in-game museum, and overall stability (particularly with the PC version) frustrated the player base as they waited for Sega to fix the problems. This week, Sega released that long-awaited patch, addressing those problems and more, hopefully stabilizing the compilation and making the overall experience more enjoyable.\nThe two biggest items this patch addresses include fixing issues with the game crashing and one of the most annoying bugs of the year: Tails falling behind in Sonic 2 and constantly jumping instead of respawning on the player – we can finally turn off mute when playing Sonic 2. The patch also includes fixes for sound bugs, menu and controller issues, museum mislabels, and data-saving issues. Unfortunately, the replacement music in Ice Cap, Carnival Night, and Launch Base remain in place. \nThe patch is available to download now for all platforms. Sonic Origins arrived on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on June 23. For more on the speedy selection of games, check out our review here.",

My ringtone is the FFVII victory fanfare theme. But the biggest hole in my fandom for years has been Final Fantasy XIV.\nMMOs have never appealed to me, but as I listened to friends and colleagues rave about FFXIV over its long existence, the more I felt like I was missing out on something special. Every expansion and free trial had me hovering over the purchase button, but I always told myself I didn’t have the time to invest in such a behemoth of a game. The excuses have come to an end. \nI’ve finally broken the seal and dived headfirst into one of the most celebrated games on the planet. Join me on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central as I trek through my first dungeon with the help of two of the biggest FFXIV experts I know. First up is the returning Jon Woodey, Game Informer web programmer extraordinaire. I’ll also have a special guest: MinnMax cohort Sarah Podzorski joins our party to lend her bubbly brand of insight. Watch along to learn some valuable tips and tricks and, if you’re like me, get an early taste of FFXIV to see if it’s something you want to jump into as well!\nWatch on Twitch!\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

          "description": "Much in the same way Nintendo recently released its financial results for the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2023, which ends March 2023, Capcom has done the same. As a result, we now have an updated list of the best-selling Capcom games as of June 30, 2022, which is when the company’s latest financial quarter ended, as reported by MyNintendoNews. \nIf you’re a Capcom fan, there’s likely no surprise as to which games are at the top, but there might be a few surprises for you in it elsewhere.\nHere are the top 10 best-selling Capcom games: \nMonster Hunter World: 18.3 million \nResident Evil 7: Biohazard: 11 million\nMonster Hunter Rise: 10.3 million\nResident Evil 2: 9.8 million\nMonster Hunter World: Iceborn: 9.5 million \nResident Evil 5: 8.3 million\nResident Evil 6: 8.3 million\nStreet Fighter V: 6.6 million\nResident Evil Village: 6.4 million\nStreet Fighter II: 6.3 million\nAs you can see, this list is mostly Monster Hunter and Resident Evil, as anyone tuned into Capcom’s releases probably could have guessed. However, it's important to note that Capcom, strangely, breaks each individual release up as its own game, meaning each of the multiple Resident Evil 4 re-releases counts as its own game. Collectively, though, Resident Evil 4 would be on this top 10 list. The same can be said for various other titles, such as Dragon's Dogma and its re-release, and more. \nNow that you’ve seen this top 10 list, go check out the top 10 best-selling games on Switch and then read Game Informer’s review of Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak, the recent expansion for the game. After that, read about Capcom’s remake of Resident Evil 4, which is due out next March. \n[Source: MyNintendoNews]\nAre you surprised by this list? Let us know in the comments below!",

It will also cost $70, and some fans have criticized Naughty Dog and PlayStation for that price, citing that $70 is a high price tag for a game released on the PlayStation 3 before getting remastered for the PlayStation 4 a year later. It also appears to be very much the same game – just with improved graphics and some changes to AI systems and other under-the-hood things. Nonetheless, it’s out on Sept. 1 and will cost $70. \nSince the reveal, Naughty Dog has been slowly dolling out information about the upcoming title, including neat comparison videos that showcase how drastic the visual upgrades are. The studio released a new one this morning, this time comparing a sequence with Ellie and Joel riding horses on a road. Check it out for yourself below: \nGet ready to hit the dusty trail for a beautiful -- and dangerous -- journey across America in The Last of Us Part I!\nhttps://t.co/kbnwKv1n5m pic.twitter.com/NoVvqUzSTp\nAugust 4, 2022\nAs you can see, the difference is night and day, with the remake looking a lot more like Part II.

The farming sim game tasks players with planting and growing lovable creatures called Ooblets, who can then perform tasks and battle other Ooblets in dance battles. You can decorate and expand your farm, plus complete side quests from the many residents of Badge Town. Ooblets has received numerous content updates over the years, such as new creatures, locations, decor, and even seasons. Glumberland announced in May that the game would go 1.0 this summer, so today's news seems to reaffirm that release window. \nWe've enjoyed Ooblets whenever we've checked in on it over the years, so it's exciting to see it approaching the finish line. Ooblets is slated to launch for Xbox One, Switch, and PC via The Epic Games Store.",
