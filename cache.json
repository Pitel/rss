What's most neat here is that one player uses their Switch in handheld mode whilst the other gets busy with their Joy-Cons in docked mode — using a required second Switch — in order to explore the world on offer, making sure that the console's gyro controls and touchscreen are all put to work as you push through the campaign.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Are there any viable alternatives out there to satisfy your handheld gaming needs? Well, yes; the aforementioned Steam Deck, for one.

          "description": "I love a courtroom visual novel and after dealing with the wonderful nonsense of the Ace Attorney and Danganronpa series, I barely batted an eyelid at Aviary Attorney’s schtick of playing as a bird-brained lawyer (who is literally a bird). At first glance, it seems kinda gimmicky, but this short visual novel has a special flair for melodrama that can turn a boring, stuffy courtroom into a theatre of drama and spectacle (plus some lavish visuals to boot).\nThe setting is 1840s France, a time when Paris is on the brink of revolution against the (literal) fat cats. You play as the dapper defence attorney Jayjay Falcon who alongside his witty lackey Sparrowson take on four seemingly unrelated cases. Travelling around Paris, you collect evidence and interview witnesses then present your findings in the courtroom and bring justice to your client.\nRead more",

The company are now settling for $520 million (£427 million).\r\n\n\r\nA federal court case claimed that Epic breached the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) by collecting details about Fortnite players who were younger than 13 years old without getting parental consent or contacting their parents. That’s been settled for $275 million. The complaint also alleged Epic illegally enabled real-time voice and text chat for young players as Fortnite’s default, which the FTC said put them at risk from strangers. \r\n\n \nRead more",

He’s on top of the world right now, getting review scores he never could have dreamed of since the salad days of the Mega Drive. A Metacritic in the 70s!

As such, I've been thinking a lot about Final Fantasy VII these last few weeks, and playing them so close together has ended up highlighting one key thing for me. Namely, that story chapters that break up the action by giving players some 'downtime' to 'hang' with your party pals, either by doing side or fetch quests for them MUST DIE. \nDrop a meteor on them or let them go the way of Aerith and be skewered into oblivion, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, because please, Square Enix, I simply cannot with the interminable sidequest chapters any more. \nRead more",

The talking alien guns weren't that irritating and the gun fights seemed solid! And it appealed to my juvenile sense of humour too. Poo and wee? Yeah, you'll get a cheap chuckle from me. I understood then that it might not be for everyone, but hey, I can roll with that if the FPS bit is good.\nHaving now spent a few hours with the final game, I've concluded that my mind must've been chemically altered by the doner kebab I consumed the night before. You can switch off your gun's verbal diarrhea through the in-game menu, but what you'll find behind the brown curtain is a very unimaginative shooter.

The sequel to Sorath's exquisite wave survival FPS flips a slow-building, protracted struggle into a hyperdense spurt of action that escalates in lockstep with your abilities, thanks to enemies that spawn the moment you've dispatched their chums and a score that ticks down with every second you spend not actively murdering. \r\n\n\r\nThat structure is also a trap. It’s an invitation to devise an opening dance that dispatches those first few waves as quickly as possible, yet following that dance too rigidly will crash you headfirst into a bonespire. Hyper Demon screams at you to go fast - though when I asked programmer Matt Bush for tips, he suggested I slow down.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Still, I was impressed by how the game's speedy combat matched its roguelike needs, as it pushed us through even the trickiest of scenarios - as opposed to other strategy games which can feel like trudging through a sea of glue.\nRead more",

It’s a grisly co-op multiplayer where instead of brawling your way through torrents of gross rat humanoids, you and your rag-tag team are now up against hordes of scabby zombies all in favour of a Imperial fascist overlord.\nSeveral of the RPS Treehouse folk have jumped into the fray, carving their way through Darktide’s industrial world of Gothic factories and towering cathedrals. The verdict? Uninspiring progression systems and short, repetitive missions aside, Darktide still remains a bone-crunching gorefest best enjoyed with pals. Preferably ones with strong stomachs.\nJames: I was actually braced to bounce off this, in the same way I bounced off Vermintide 2 and its monotonously melee-focused ratman slaughter. Nope – I’m 22 hours in and not even close to abandoning interest in my greasy crew of Imperial screwups. I think it might be because Darktide strikes a finer balance of slicing and shooting? Like there’s more of a dynamism to horde fights when you’re switching between the two.

          "description": "When Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII first came out in 2007 as part of Square Enix's somewhat indulgent (and merely so-so) FF7 Compilation project, it was intended to fill in the backstory of one of the main game's most mysterious and spoilerific character twists. Namely that FF7 hero and perpetual mopey boy Cloud Strife wasn't quite who he thought he was, and that he actually owes a lot of his life (literally and figuratively) to the peppy, squat-loving ShinRa go-getter Zack Fair. (And if you're mad about me spoiling that 25-year-old story beat, wait until you see what they've done with FF7 Remake).\nIt's with FF7 Remake in mind, though, that many of you will probably be wondering where this swanky new remaster of FF7's PSP prequel fits into the increasingly up for grabs timeline of Squeenix's ongoing Remake trilogy. And just as the original Crisis Core was almost impossible to talk about without entering major spoiler territory for the main game of Final Fantasy VII, so it goes for Crisis Core - Final Fantasy VII - Reunion. For the spoiler-averse, I'll say this. If you don't already know the backstory of Zack and his relationship with arch mega villain Sephiroth, this is a perfectly fine action game that's received a lot of welcome polish for a 15-year old PSP title, but is probably still best experienced through a comprehensive YouTube retrospective as opposed to forking out £40 / $50 for it. For everyone else out there, though, let's get into it.\nRead more",

I saw the official restriction of \"only one Charizard can be earned from raids per save file\" and took it at face value.\nSo on this second run, I just threw caution to the wind and tried to breed a Charizard to see what would happened. The results? Lots of new Charmanders to give out! Here's how to breed one and evolve it.\n\nUse the standard egg hatching method with Ditto and your Tera Raid Charizard\nThere's nothing really new here that you need to do: just use the same egg hatching method, but have Ditto and your raid Charizard in your party.\nStart a picnic, and if you want, eat an egg-based sandwich to increase the rate in which eggs trigger. After some time passes at your picnic with the aforementioned parameters, walk over to the basket on the other side of the picnic table, and see if there's an egg in there (there could be multiple!).\nIf you need a refresh, we have a full guide on where to find Ditto here, and a comprehensive guide on egg hatching here.\n\nCharmander evolves into Charmeleon at level 16, and Charizard at level 36\nAfter hatching, the default Charmander will have the scratch and growl moves as a level 1 Pokemon. You can find the stats of my particular Charmander above.\nNote that you can evolve your Charmander as normal. At level 16, it'll turn into a Charmeleon, and at level 36, it'll evolve into a Charizard.\nThe post Yes, you can hatch a Charmander in Pokemon Scarlet & Violet appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It's coming up very soon\nIf you want to get your hands on a Cinderace in Pokemon Scarlet & Violet, you may want to prep for 7 star Tera Raids soon-ish.\nThanks to Serebii.net, we now know that there is going to be a 7 star Cinderace event running on December 30, with a \"second chance\" coming on January 13. This is the exact same scheme as the Charizard raid events, but there's a little more leeway here to finish up the requirements (which includes not only finishing the base game, but some postgame as well).\nAs a reminder, you'll only be able to catch this particular raid-based Pokemon once per save file, and it will be a fighting tera type: with the mightiest mark (again, similar to Charizard). It will also likely follow suit with Charizard in that it will not be part of the Paldea Pokedex.\nThe first Scarlet & Violet Cinderace Tera Raid battle event will start on December 30\nClear out your schedule if you really want Cinderace, as you'll need to do some prep before December 30 rolls around. To unlock the ability to play against 7 star raids, you'll need to complete the story, finish all of the gyms again in the postgame, then clear the Mesagoza tournament. After that, you'll want to seek out 10 five star raids (you need to host them/find them yourself on the map): then you can unlock 6 and 7 star raids.\nWe have a full guide here for getting ready for 7 star raids.\nHere are the full dates for each event:\nDecember 30, 2022 -January 1, 2023\nJanuary 13, 2022 - January 15, 2023\nThe post PSA: A Cinderace Tera Raid battle is coming to Pokémon Scarlet & Violet appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Spectator mode, replays, online stability and more\nEarlier this month, publisher 3goo released the 2005 2D fighting title The Rumble Fish 2 onto modern consoles, offering the unique scrapper its first worldwide home release ever. Unfortunately, despite the quality of the game itself, the release was a woefully disappointing way to present this long-lost classic.\nThe new release of Rumble Fish 2 forces 16x9 widescreen support, has a soft filter by default, does not support keyboard for its Steam release, and is missing rudimentary fighting game features for its online modes, such as lobbies, a replay function, and even the ability to rematch your opponent. Additionally, The Rumble Fish 2 is priced at $30, and locks three characters behind an additional $10 paywall. Yikes.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtrhFxv-2WA&ab_channel=3goo\nFollowing a slew of negative feedback directed toward The Rumble Fish 2 on Steam, a developer has responded to the \"Top Review\", suggesting that an update is incoming. The update is aiming to add some of the requested features, including savable replays, a spectator mode, additional practice mode settings, and more. A separate update also rolled out on all platforms today, which fixes several unspecified issues with the game's online and offline modes.\nIt's a big positive to see 3goo address some of the issues with this disappointing release. A 4x3 option would be essential, as dedicated players are discovering that the forced 16x9 ratio is, incredibly, causing some wall-bounce combos to break. Additionally, the locked DLC characters should be addressed, whether the publisher caves and offers the trio to all players, or simply reduces the retail price of the base game. There is still much to do to make The Rumble Fish 2 an appealing release, but this update is a start.\nThe Rumble Fish 2 is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.\nThe post The Rumble Fish 2 looks to add key features with incoming update appeared first on Destructoid.",

This one too!\nFrom the mind of reggtegg over on Reddit, this working Switch dock recreates the aesthetic of Generation 4: aka the Sinnoh region from Pokemon Diamond and Pearl. The design looks big, but it's functional, and perfectly replicates the look of the Pokecenter from that series of games. Man, I miss those escalators.\nIf you're interested, here is their Etsy store. They mention that they will be \"releasing this as an item in the next week or so.\" It'll be using a Polymaker Terra filament for a \"cool matte texture.\"\nSinnoh is making a comeback\nTruth be told, Sinnoh was the first region where I missed out on playing a new generational Pokemon game day one. I had a lot going on in my life in 2007, and most of my Pokemon-playing friends went to other colleges, or fell out of love with the series. It wasn't until I started playing with my wife that I really had an excuse to get back into it in earnest, and my fondness for the franchise was rekindled.\nNow Sinnoh is back for real with Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl in the mix, keeping the region alive for a new generation of players.\n[gallery link=\"file\" columns=\"2\" size=\"large\" ids=\"354856,354855\"]\nThe post This fan made Sinnoh Pokecenter Switch dock is lovely appeared first on Destructoid.",

In addition, each game's memorable score has been composed by the series' veteran maestro Nobuo Uematsu. The series includes Final Fantasy I-VI, dating all the way back to 1987.\n\nSquare Enix announced that the six games will be available to purchase digitally as a bundle or as separate releases. In addition, two physical releases were also announced as Square Enix store exclusives. Unfortunately, given the late-night timing of the official announcement, these editions essentially sold out while many fans were in slumberland. A \"waiting list\" for a $75 Standard Edition and a $260 Anniversary Edition is now available on the Square Enix Store, and hopefully, both titles will be restocked.\nThe Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster series affords players the opportunity to witness the birth of a legend, readily available on modern platforms and looking better than ever before. Porting these classic RPGs to PlayStation and Switch platforms only further ensures that a little bit of gaming history can be retold to younger audiences, setting the stage for the litany of incredible adventures to come.\nFinal Fantasy Pixel Remaster series launches on PS4 and Nintendo Switch spring 2023.\nThe post Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster hits PS4, Switch spring 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Now available on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, it's Namco platformer Marvel Land!\nReleased to arcades in 1990, Marvel Land is a fantasy adventure that sees players guide a young hero, Prince Paco, through a series of colorful and hazardous stages on a quest to rescue the adorable Princess Luxie, who has been abducted by the wicked Mole King. What follows is typically cute platforming fare, as Paco negotiates \"Marvel Land\", essentially an amusement park wherein the Mole King resides.\nAs such, the adventure consists of dashing and jumping through numerous rides and attractions, while battling the mad monarch's rodent army — The Mogles — and their various lieutenants. To aid him on his quest, Prince Paco can gather various power-ups including dragon wings, speed shoes, and a secondary clone to double the fun, double the pleasure.\nCheck out all the fun of the fair in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber Replay Burners.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VZMj_Dq6-E&ab_channel=ReplayBurners\nWhile the arcade edition of Marvel Land was rarely seen on the circuit, the game would be ported to the Sega Mega Drive, newly monikered as Talmit's Adventure — quite possible to avoid attracting the ire of Spider-Man-lovin' lawyers. In a cute touch, Marvel Land features a stage that takes place in a parade, which features a who's who of classic Namco characters, including Pooka from Dig Dug, Gilgamesh and Ki from Tower of Druaga, Pacet from Baraduke, Mappy, my girl Wonder Momo, and, of course, Pac-Man. Coincidentally, almost all games referenced in Marvel Land are also available as part of the Arcade Archives.\nMarvel Land is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.\nThe post Take a trip through Namco history with Arcade Archives’ Marvel Land appeared first on Destructoid.",

Case in point: This wonderful fan animation, produced by the super-talented artist/animator Liz Caingcoy.\nThe 45-second short sees our gal making the most of a bright and sunny afternoon, taking to the streets with her yo-yo and plush companion, Roger, in tow. It's a pretty delightful affair, and who could possibly expect things to get surprisingly... out of hand. The animation is masterfully created out of textured wireforms, which were designed and built within the software package Autodesk Maya. This gives the short its curious and highly recognizable \"'90s PlayStation Cutscene\" vibe.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiwbfME8g-o\nIf you take a look at some of Caingcoy's tweets, you can see the Bridget model in its raw form, which spotlights the authentic textures applied to  Bridget in order to perfectly replicate her Guilty Gear Strive style. Be sure to check out some of Caingcoy's animations over on her YouTube channel, and hey, if you're a developer in need of an animator, it's worth noting that she's currently looking for work.\nGuilty Gear Strive is available now on PlayStation and PC platforms.\nThe post Guilty Gear’s Bridget has an apocalyptic day out in cute fan animation appeared first on Destructoid.",

The genre has absolutely exploded in the years following Stardew Valley and there seems to be no shortage of developers looking to have players out there hoeing with the best of 'em. In 2022, we saw some fine farm sims, including Harvestella, the Doraemon Story of Seasons sequel, and the absolutely resplendent Wylde Flowers. Looking ahead to 2023, we have Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life, Rune Factory 3 Special, Fae Farm, and hopefully the full release of Coral Island.

          "description": "A sizeable shake-up following Criterion's latest game\nSome changes are being made at Electronic Arts' Criterion Games, following its latest launch. Five long-time developers at the studio are leaving, just after Criterion launched Need For Speed Unbound.\nAs reported by GamesIndustry.biz, Criterion GM and VP Matt Webster is leaving the studio after working at Criterion for more than two decades. Head of studio development Alan McDairmant and head of content Steve Uphill are also departing, as well as executive producer Pete Lake and senior technical director Andrei Shires.\nAll five put in a sizeable chunk of years at the company, and all are leaving to explore \"new opportunities outside of EA,\" via GIbiz.\nDavid Rutter, the GM of EA's racing group, has announced some shifts following these departures. Charity Joy from the EA Sports UFC team is joining as executive producer for Need For Speed, while Codemasters' Geoff Smith is moving over to take up a spot as senior director of product development. The two join head of studio operations Steve Cuss, who has stayed in his role.\n\"As we look ahead, we know there’s a strong opportunity to evolve our games and experiences, and bring them to an even broader audience of fans–with our long-term strategy centered on our strengths in licensed motorsports as well as arcade/open-world racing,\" said Rutter in a note to staff.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2Y8XCe7F9E\nSpeed unleashed\nThe latest Need For Speed, Unbound, rolled in rather suddenly this month. The latest entry in the series takes a different aesthetic approach, leaning on some stylized features that give me some Spider-Verse vibes. Still, it seems like the reception has at least been somewhat solid.\nNevertheless, these are some notable departures for Criterion. Hopefully the long-time racing game studio can lean into the curve on them and come out ahead.\nThe post Several Criterion Games veterans are leaving the studio appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "When it finally drops, you won't see me for weeks\nIt's been rumored for years at this point, and fans of the series have been desperately trying to manifest it into existence, but now it's official: Guerrilla is working on a Horizon multiplayer project, as they confirmed via their Twitter account today. It wasn't so much of an announcement specifically highlighting the upcoming multiplayer game as it was a post of job listings, but it's confirmation and that's all I care about. Even when these big studios try to play their cards close to their chest, it's those darn job listings that always give them away -- they have to make the game somehow, and I find it kind of a fun tradition now that we find out in a kind of indirect way.\nhttps://twitter.com/LifeAtGuerrilla/status/1603752192166469634\nThe text of the tweet itself is innocent enough, but the studio announces their future plans clearly within the attached graphic. \"We are continuing to create epic solo adventures for Aloy. But there is more,\" the post reads. \"A new internal team is developing a separate Online Project set in Horizon's universe. Featuring a new cast of characters and a unique stylized look, friends will be able to explore the majestic wilds of Horizon together.\" Okay, so maybe this time around, the announcement was a bit more direct than usual.\nGuerrilla has a whole host of new positions open from Combat Designers to Technical Artists to Programmers, but admittedly the roles that intrigue me the most are the narrative-focused positions. It's cool to see that the studio is investing some of its new talent into the storytelling side of things, because Horizon is so well known for its incredible worldbuilding and engaging narrative. I will absolutely be looking forward to any updates on the project, but this announcement alone is enough excitement to keep me going for a while.\nThe post Guerrilla is officially working on a Horizon multiplayer project appeared first on Destructoid.",

Well, once!) in Pokemon Scarlet & Violet. Since then I've seen some confusion as to how to unlock and find these seven-star raids: so here's a full breakdown. Remember, you have until December 18 at 3:59PM PT to get your Charizard, or grind out the rewards.\nFirst you need to unlock high-end raids\nIf you haven't already, finish up the game (quick, you only have a few more days!), and clear the required post-game questline. This will enable seven-star raids, which can be found on the world map or joined via online play.\nWe have a full guide on how to unlock them here.\n[gallery link=\"file\" columns=\"2\" size=\"large\" ids=\"354675,354676\"]\nLocate it on the main map, and host a raid yourself\nWhen you have the proper requirements unlocked, seven-star raids will appear on your map. You can locate them via flashing dragon icons (more info on how to discern specific icons here).\nJust head there and interact with the raid den to start a Tera Raid battle. You'll want to go online, and use strong Pokemon for seven-star raids: preferably at level 100, and with an affinity for taking down a dragon/fire type. In any case, we have a full guide on how to take down Charizard here!\n[gallery link=\"file\" columns=\"2\" size=\"large\" ids=\"354677,354678\"]\nSearch for a raid, even if you don't have one available\nAlternatively, if you don't want to host a raid (or don't have any available to trigger), you can search for them online.\nConnect to the internet, then select the Poke Portal in the main menu. Select Tera Raid Battle, then search for a Charizard on the list. As soon as you see it click it: as you'll get a lot of competition from would-be players trying to join. If no Charizard raids show up, wait for the \"check for new postings\" sign to light up: then press X to search again.\nThe post How to find the Charizard Tera Raid in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "We’re approaching the end of 2022, and we’re concluding the year by going back to our Super Replay roots by tackling an old-school survival horror game. In this case, we’re replaying one of the greatest games of the PS1 era, Silent Hill! Join us live on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central as we endure two hours of nostalgic, hair-raising scares. If you can’t catch us live, each episode will be available to watch on Saturdays on the Game Informer Shows YouTube channel. \nIn 1999, Konami put the fear of fog in a generation of players with the release of Silent Hill. The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that's (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later.\n\n\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

Now that he’s reached the top of the mountain, the series is giving the perpetually young hero his last hurrah before kicking off a fresh adventure starring a new cast of characters.\n\n\nThe Pokémon Company announced that beginning January 13 (in Japan), Ash and Pikachu’s final chapter begins. It consists of 11 special episodes serving as a grand send-off celebrating the duo's achievements. It also features some familiar faces from Ash’s past, including Misty and Brock.\nSometime later in the year, a new yet-to-be-titled animated series set in Scarlet/Violet’s Paldea region kicks offs. It stars two young trainers, Liko and Roy, joined by the three starters of that region: Sprigatito, Fuecoco, and Quaxly. The trailer also teases the appearance of a shiny Rayquaza.\nSo this is it. If you spent your childhood following Ash's exploits or have stuck with him for his entire run, how does it feel to finally see the character get his flowers and ride off into the sunset? Are you looking forward to finally seeing a series starring new heroes and storylines? Let us know in the comments!",

And you can do so the day you bring home your PSVR2 system. \n\n\n\"A deeper and more captivating adventure awaits with PlayStation VR2, as Ethan Winters' journey takes full advantage of the headset's advanced features,\" a press release reads. \"VR Mode utilizes the 4K HDR display, eye tracking, and 3D audio to make Resident Evil Village more realistic and intense than ever.\"\nCapcom says the platform's PSVR2 Sense controllers will add even more immersion to the new mode. \n\"These [controllers] represent Ethan's famously resilient hands and allow intuitive actions to be performed in-game,\" Capcom writes in a press release. \"Players can hold up their arms to guard against enemies that get too close for comfort. Weapons all feel tangibly more realistic in VR Mode with new gameplay elements that dial up the immersion, such as dual wielding and natural motion controls for reloading firearms and brandishing knives.\" \nAre you going to check out Resident Evil Village in VR?

The game sees Toys for Bob, the studio behind Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time, step back into the developer role for the Crash Bandicoot series, but with a decidedly different approach in tow.\nCrash Team Rumble puts players in the shoes of Crash, Dingodile, and the Bandicoot's stable of friends and enemies. Each character has their own powers, personality, and playstyle as they duke it out in 4v4 competitions across a wide array of arenas. The teams compete in a variety of activities to bank the most Wumpa fruit in their drop-off zone while simultaneously defending it.\n\"We're so excited to unveil our fresh new take on multiplayer in the Crash universe with Crash Team Rumble,\" Paul Yan, co-studio head at Toys for Bob said in a press release. \"Crash Team Rumble has something for everyone – easy pick-up and play for those who just want to jump in, while also providing skilled gamers the opportunity to leverage and master their hero's unique abilities.\"\nYou can see the reveal trailer below.\n\n\nCrash Team Rumble comes to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in 2023.

Another person in the room calls the man a banisher, one who hunts ghosts. Then, the woman at the table dissolves away into a blue light, indicating that she was a ghost the whole time. Afterward, we get a glimpse at what gameplay might look like, with the man and his ghostly companion leaping into battle with an undead creature called a bonewalker.\nOutside that brief trailer, we got a release window.

His mother, Jun Kazama, makes an appearance in the trailer as well to tell Jin that together, they'll \"cleanse the world of its evil and corruption.\" \nCheck out the Tekken 8 gameplay trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Tekken 8 is looking great. The trailer above is mostly focused on teasing details about the game's story, which will seemingly feature Jin and the struggles of his family dynamic (thanks, Heihachi). There are also quick clips of Tekken 8 gameplay, although it's void of the UI that showcases each fighter's HP and other elements. \nTekken 8 was revealed earlier this year during a PlayStation State of Play held in September. That reveal trailer focused on Kazuya and his son, Jin, and you can watch it here. \nTekken 8 will be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via Steam. It does not yet have a release date. \nAre you excited for Tekken 8? Let us know in the comments below!",

          "description": "Death Stranding 2 – the sequel to one of the best games of the previous console generation – was announced tonight during The Game Awards. As you might expect from director Hideo Kojima, it was baffling. \nThe trailer begins with Fragile, played by Lea Seydoux (No Time to Die, Crimes of the Future), running from some kind of threat while carrying a BB (a baby in an artificial womb; it's a whole thing) in tow. We then get a brief look at Sam Porter Bridges – the protagonist of the first game, played by Norman Reedus (The Walking Dead) – who Fragile tells, \"It's time for you to hit the road and start a new journey.\" Then everything truly goes off the rails. \nGiant mecha vehicles (not too unlike the titular Metal Gears from Kojima's previous series at Konami, Metal Gear Solid). Primary antagonist Higgs dressed like President Amelie Strand and playing an electric guitar. A BB pod full of tentacles. The ominous question, \"Should we have connected,\" casting doubts on the entire objective of the first game – connecting the United States – all quickly flashes onscreen. If it sounds like a lot, it is. Check it out for yourself below:\n\n\nWe're calling it Death Stranding 2, but from the looks of it, the game is actually named DS2. Also, aside from the previously mentioned movie stars, it features Elle Fanning (The Neon Demon) and Shioli Kutsuna (Deadpool 2). \nDuring a brief interview after the trailer, Kojima revealed he and his company, Kojima Productions, are also working on another video game project and other \"visual\" works.\nNo real release information was given, though the game is once again being published by Sony. The trailer also said the footage was captured on a PS5. So, it might be safe to assume Death Stranding 2, like Death Stranding before it, will have some window of exclusivity on Sony platforms. Guerilla Games will also be acting as a support studio, and its proprietary engine, Decima, will once again be used for the game.",

Longtime Santa Monica Studios lead Eric Williams directed the sequel, which released last month. \nFortunately for all of us, though, Barlog was able to convince Judge that quitting was not the right call. Judge touched on this during his lengthy speech at The Game Awards 2022 after accepting the award for best performance in a video game.\n\n\nHere's what he said: \n\"I think it's kind of common knowledge that we were honored to go to Tribeca after 2018, and when Cory took me outside and said he wouldn't be directing the next one, I literally did quit. I quit. And he said, 'Nah, I vouch for Eric.' And I said, 'Eric Williams better be a beast.' Eric Williams is a motherf---ing beast.\"\nIt's unclear if Judge legitimately quit or if he was just using these words to express his initial disappointment that Barlog was not returning to direct Ragnarök. Nonetheless, Barlog vouched for Williams, and now we have Ragnarök, one of our highest-rated games of 2022 here at Game Informer.",

Evath's moon Mitral has turned into a gigantic gas time bomb. A meteor is also due to impact Mitral in the next several hours. You were chosen to secure each of Mitral's 18 sectors by positioning a drilling rig over the gas pockets in each sector before the meteor strikes.\nSolve challenging riddles by relying on geological clues, intuition, or good old trial and error. To survive your mission, find Rubicon crystals to restore energy and destroy (or avoid) the Laser Beacons and Skanners left behind by the Ketars. Good luck!\nOur reimplemented engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Driller support is limited to DOS (EGA mode), Amiga and AtariST releases, but we hope to be able to add more soon! Please contact us if you have some other release.\nTo play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.\n>",

New features since beta1 include: Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. A new Generate World menu which now includes NewGRF, AI, and Game Script configuration menus. Cargo filters for vehicle lists (such as at stations) to allow better visualization of traffic. Optional cargo names above vehicles in vehicle lists, to show at a glance what they carry. The ability to clone or share orders with vehicles grouped by shared orders. An improved local authority action window which now shows you actions you can’t afford, instead of hiding them. In addition, some new tools are available to AI and Game Script authors: Scriptable league tables which can replace the default scoring system AI and Game Scripts can now be modified in Scenario Editor for existing scenarios (although not savegames) (As ever, see the changelog for further details).
