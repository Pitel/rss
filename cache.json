          "description": "Blizzard issues an update.\nIn the month of September, Blizzard launched Diablo II: Resurrected - a remaster of its classic ARPG hack-and-slash, originally released on computers two decades ago.\nWhile this remaster encountered some teething issues at launch, players were (mostly) still able to access the online mode, grind levels and access their character saves. Somehow though, over the past week, it's all fallen apart on Blizzard's end and a lot of players (across all platforms) are struggling to just log into the game. Some have even lost characters along the way, thanks to the ongoing server outages.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

We're fans of the lovely new screen and the various refinements to the basic design that gives the consoles a marginally more premium feel over the trusty standard Switches we've been rocking for several years now.\nLooking at Nintendo's marketing materials, you'd be forgiven for thinking that there's only one variant available — the one with the new white dock and Joy-Con — but there's also a version with the good old neon red and blue Joy-Con and a black dock for the Switch traditionalists and lovers of the OG hues.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Suggestions that Nintendo underestimated demand.\nIt's been a week where social media metrics, combined with initial sales data available in the UK, have pointed to a solid start for the Switch OLED model. Now that the Japanese sales data is emerging, though, it seems that the system has hit a bump in the road.\nThe issue isn't its popularity, but seems to be more related to manufacturing issues and - perhaps - a strategic error on Nintendo's part. Bloomberg has shared an interesting report on the Famitsu sales figures, which shows that the launch of OLED has performed below the original and Lite models in Japan. Yet pre-orders in the country sold out quickly, demonstrating that the issue has been Nintendo's inability to meet demand.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Larian put blood, sweat and tears into Baldur’s Gate 3’s latest patch. I mean, they’ve literally put them in: venture into the scorching heat of a subterranean forge and you’ll see a greasy sheen on your hero’s face during conversational close-ups. Get blood spattered on you in battle and it’ll remain until you take a long rest to wash it away. Same goes for dirt, and bruises that bloom at low health. “We want you to feel you’ve been adventuring a bit,” says lead systems designer Nick Pechenin, “rather than just stepping out of a modelling agency.”\r\n\n\r\nIf he’d seen the potato-faced oddballs I’ve repeatedly made in character creation (saves are not compatible between big patches) Pechenin would not be so generous. Even so, I like seeing heroes wearing evidence of their travels. An earlier patch already made the camping system feel more demanding - a small price in food means you can’t just spam it after every fight - and now those longer treks between naps can visually sell you on the difficult journey heroes are undertaking, too. A journey that, with patch six, has gotten a little longer.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "ElecHead is one of those devilishly clever puzzle platformers that delights at every turn. Developed by solo dev NamaTakahashi, you play as the titular Elec, a tiny robot whose body can electrify whatever surface he touches, causing it to light up a dazzling shade of yellow in the dark halls of a strange, underground facility. \nTechnically, it's his head where his electrical currents stem from, which you quickly learn how to throw in order to flip switches from afar, create new platforms and dodge deadly obstacles in order to get from one side of the room to the other. The catch? Elec's body only has ten seconds of power left when he's without his head, causing him to explode if he doesn't reach it in time. The result is a stunningly good puzzle game whose bank of brilliantly conceived ideas is executed to perfection, and it left me with a big fat grin on my face for the whole of its three hour run-time.\nRead more",

If you’re looking for something different now that the Gallo has been nerfed, the Ironhide is an excellent choice. With two-shot kill potential, it’s a menace up close. To maximize its strengths though, you’re going to need the best build.\r\n\nTo make Shotguns work in Warzone, you need as much range and hipfire accuracy as you can get. Target those stats with this build:\r\n\nThis may be a shotgun, but we’re still starting off with an Agency Choke and Task Force Barrel. Both attachments grant a big boost to damage range, though the Task Force comes with a hipfire penalty. That's why the SOF Target Designator is also a must on Cold War shotguns, as it provides even more of the two stats we need; hipfire accuracy and damage range. You have some options in the stock slot, but we’ve gone with No Stock here. This is the biggest mobility boost you can get on your Ironhide, which is a big help when dueling SMG users. Unfortunately, it also comes with a hipfire penatly. These unfortunate tradeoffs have really held Cold War shotguns back in the meta. If you find the hipfire spread on this build isn't tight enough, a Wire Stock boosts sprint-to-fire speed without a penalty. Finally, we’ve gone with the 7 Round Tube magazine to help take on groups of foes without a reload.\r\n \nRead more",

Warzone’s newest rifle packs a potent combination of damage and fire rate that makes for excellent time-to-kill numbers. The Grav also boasts one of the highest bullet velocities in the Assault Rifle category and is one of the only Cold War weapons with a caliber-conversion magazine. Get a handle on its beastly recoil, and the Grav has the potential to be a top-tier rifle. Here are the best ways to build it out.\r\n\nThe Grav’s excellent damage and bullet velocity make it highly effective at long-range if you can control the recoil. That’s no easy task, but this build will help:\r\n\nAs usual, you’ll want to start with an Agency Suppressor and Task Force Barrel. I’m as tired of writing that sentence as you are of reading it, but until Vanguard drops this is the long-range combo for every Cold War weapon. The pile of damage range and recoil control stats these two attachments provide are too good to pass up. You’ll want a Field Agent Grip as well for maximum recoil control. The Grav has a lot of vertical climb, so even skilled players should welcome the help. You’ll want some zoom for range as well, and the Axial Arms 3x remains the go-to. If you prefer a Royal and Kross 4x or other optic though, you’ll have no issues making a substitution. \r\n \nRead more",

The project started focused on LucasArts adventure games built in the SCUMM game engine and the first release only supported Monkey Island 2, and it has since grown to support over 300 games across other genres too. To celebrate that big birthday, a new update hit adding support for more game engines and many more games, including The Longest Journey, Grim Fandango, and Crusader: No Remorse.\nRead more",

Went back in the afternoon, disabled a few turrets, then hid behind a bin for a bit. All solely to turn off an oxygen pump and asphyxiate a bubble-encased band that I could have easily shot in a few seconds. Tomorrow, I may climb to the top of a three story building just to plummet, machete first, on the face of a guard that killed me once a few loops back. Hello. My name is Colt, and I am the pettiest videogame protagonist in existence.\r\n\n\r\nIn his Deathloop review, Brendy described Colt as “playing it by ass”. I liked that line, but I didn’t yet understand its true gravitas. I am now enlightened. I have beheld the true ass of Colt, and I have grasped its magnitude: Colt’s ass is the antithesis to Dishonored’s heart. Blam. Boot. Blam. None of you are free of sin. \r\n\n \nRead more",

The one in Impostor Factory is a secluded manor deep in the woods, a crumbling temple to cleanliness with self-cleaning floors and a literal golden toilet in the bathroom. You are the first to arrive, shoulders heavy with rain. You don't know much about the hosts, apart from the fact that they're old, eccentric, and eager to unveil the mysterious machine looming in the main hall. The other guests are as rich and quirky as the villa's owners, and you, an everyday man named Quincy, are starting to feel a bit awkward about the whole situation. And yet you stay because you're curious about the machine, the weird vision you had in the bathroom, and that other guest you keep bumping into - the lady in a red dress that looks familiar and sad and full of secrets. \nThe stage is set. The guests are gathered. The murders begin. And then they happen again, and again, and again. The real mystery is not discovering who committed the murders. The mystery is understanding why they keep happening.\nRead more",

The paper points to AMD CPUs suffering from a side-channel leakage vulnerability through timing and power variations of the PREFETCH instruction. The paper argues that AMD CPUs should activate stronger page table isolation by default. AMD has now published their security response where they are not recommending any mitigation changes at this time. But what if Kernel Page Table Isolation (KPTI/PTI) proves necessary for AMD CPUs? Here are some initial benchmarks showing what that performance impact could look like.",
