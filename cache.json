In any normal situation, this would be enough to put prospective Tamers off entering into a new world full of people with a high baseline knowledge of the game's mechanics and techniques. Fortunately, Humble Games has released a handy 'Tips and 'Tricks' guide to ensure that your first steps in the Floating Archipelago are as comfortable as possible.\nBreaking down everything from the basics of Temtem battles and online co-op to the nuances of breeding and home customisation, the above guide trailer sets a pretty good starting knowledge of the game for those who want to brush up on their skills before playing.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Restless Soul, from developer Fuz Games, is a visual blend of Tamagotchi-style sprites in a Kindle Paperwhite world: austere, entirely greyscale, and extremely minimalist. It's a game that actually works better in handheld than it does on a larger display.\nFunctioning as a stripped-back action-RPG, there are some seek-and-collect objects to pursue should you feel so inclined, but not a sniff of a hit-point or any of the other bumph usually associated with the genre. Spread over eight worlds and accompanying towns, you can freely backtrack by way of teleportation.

Square Enix's new trademark visual style started with 2018's Octopath Traveler and has also been used in this year's strategy RPG Triangle Strategy. But, arguably, its true potential has been realised in the stunning remake of Live A Live.\nWith every new HD-2D game, Square Enix has pushed the boat out further. Colour-popping pixels and stunning diorama-esque worlds made us dream of remakes the first time we saw this visual style come to life, but Live A Live proved it was possible — and absolutely worth it.

          "description": "This game has a monkey in a lab coat.\n'Cyberpunk' has become a bit of a dirty word in games as of late after a certain game's widely-publicised rough launch. However, video games and the cyberpunk aesthetic have gone hand in hand for almost as long as the medium has existed. From SNES-era titles like Shadowrun and Hideo Kojima’s wildly underappreciated Snatcher and Policenauts; to the present where we find games like Astral Chain, VA-11 HALL-A, and — yes — Cyberpunk 2077. In fact, it's so common in games that it becomes harder and harder to be wow-ed by the aesthetic. Despite this, ANNO: Mutationem pulled us in right away.\nANNO (no relation to the popular city building simulator of the same name) is an action-RPG that comes courtesy of indie developer ThinkingStars in conjunction with Sony’s China Hero Project. After launching on Playstation platforms and PC in March, it makes its way to Nintendo’s hybrid with a near-flawless conversion, only let down by some long load times and the occasional frame rate dip.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Don't gooo!\".\nCast your mind back to 1996, you might remember the now-iconic opening cinematic for Capcom's Resident Evil, featuring the in-game S.T.A.R.S team in a live-action shoot (for Nintendo gamers specficially, you might have first encountered the cinematic in the 2006 DS release, Resident Evil: Deadly Silence). Even in the mid-'90s, it was considered to be pretty cheesy, but its inclusion has been cited by Resident Evil fans as one of their favourite aspects of the original game in more recent years.\nNow, after 26 years, three of the cast members have reunited to promote a fan project from YouTube channel Residence of Evil. As reported by Time Extension, Charles Kraslavsky (Chris Redfield), Greg Smith (Barry Burton), and Eric Pirius (Albert Wesker (he still looks like him!)) sit down with host and filmmaker Andrew Saullo to talk about their experiences shooting the cinematic, whether they remained in contact with one another in the years since, and how they became involved with Residence of Evil's fan project called 'The Keeper: A Biohazard Story'.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Our friends over at Time Extension spotted the game in a listing shared by Twitter user @ohfivepro. What makes this so special?

          "description": "Meet the \"Playboy\"... No, not that one.\nBritish video game developer Rare is undoubtedly best known for its close relationship with Nintendo back in the '90s and early '00s, before Microsoft outright acquired it in 2002. Indeed, games like GoldenEye 007, Banjo-Kazooie, and Perfect Dark have all cemented themselves as icons in the industry; games that have not only stood the test of time in their own right, but also directly influenced a good deal of the titles you play to this day.\nIn the late '80s, however, Rare embarked on a decidedly different venture; one that ultimately never came to fruition. As reported by our friends over at Time Extension, before Nintendo's Game Boy system was announced and released, Rare's co-founder Chris Stamper worked on a hardware project known as the RAZZ arcade board which used a Zilog Z80 processor and could apparently display thousands of on-screen colours - certainly more than Nintendo's own Game Boy could manage. This board would then be utilised in a handheld device that Rare christened the 'Playboy', with much of the exterior design handled by the company's other co-founder, Tim Stamper.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

A 2017 console evaluation by The Able Gamers Charity confirmed just this, commenting on the Switch's 'zero accessibility features' at launch. Since then, Nintendo introduced system-level button remapping and the ability to zoom, but there's still much more that could be done, and YouTuber Akaki Kuumeri has created a Joy-Con adaptor to begin moving these problems in the opposite direction.\nKuumeri's design (shown in the video above) works to combat certain dexterity issues some gamers experience as a result of the console's traditional two-handed approach to gaming. Flipping one Joy-Con into an upside-down position, the adaptor lets you play the console's two-handed control system from the button inputs of a single controller.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The critical and commercial success of The House In Fata Morgana surprised many upon the title’s international release, including the developers themselves. Headlines were made when the game shot temporarily to the spot of most critically-acclaimed game of all time on Metacritic, despite being still relatively under the radar beforehand. Fata Morgana first released to the public in Japan in 2012, and gained a cult following before its eventual successful international release. The reason for it's acclaim? Storytelling. Every single review praised Fata Morgana's surprising and enthralling twists and turns as what made this visual novel a must-play title, even for non-fans of the genre.\r\n\n\r\nAt the time development started, NOVECT were less a development studio, and more of a group of univeristy friends with minimal coding experience but a love for telling stories; a hobby project run by friends on the side of university and normal jobs inside and out of the games industry, only becoming a fully-fledged studio later down the line. Fast forward to today, NOVECT are a firmly-established indie developer with games and multimedia adaptations of their work under their belt, and new project still mysteriously known as \"Project Code Name 'M'\" now in the works. Originally starting development in 2019 and announced earlier this year, Project M had its first public demo at this month’s Bitsummit indie gaming showcasing in Kyoto.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "There were high expectations going into Buried Memory, patch 6.2 for Final Fantasy XIV - new raids, new story, and, most importantly, a new mode called Island Sanctuary to fulfil all of your farming dreams. There were Harvest Moon and Animal Crossing memes aplenty in the run up to release, with players hungry to customise their own cosy piece of Hydaelyn.\r\n\n\r\nMeant as a casual mode to relax away from dungeons and grinding levels, Island Sanctuary has no Job level limitations and can be enjoyed by anyone. Even though you can craft your own buildings and gather materials, you don’t need to have played any gathering or crafting classes. With a base to customise, crops to tend to and a pasture full of animals to pet, it’s easy to see why comparisons were drawn to other farming games such as Stardew Valley.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "We've got a pretty good line in interesting folk traditions here at RPS. I grew up in a county where staying up all night at the stone circle to welcome the Summer Solstice was an annual tradition (later augmented by a woman wearing antlers offering a selection of downers and hallucinogens), and as a child I had an unnecessary encounter with the Salisbury Hob-Nob. For the past few years Alice0 has gone to the Burryman's Parade, gracing us with pictures of that most wholesome gentleman. Rural traditions are fun if you're part of them, but to outsiders they can be unsettling at best. \nThis is relevant to my thinking about Saturnalia, an upcoming survival horror game by Italian studio Santa Ragione, where a small group of outsiders try to escape a village on the night of an ancient ritual. I've been playing a preview build of Saturnalia for the last week or so, and also got to talk about it with the studio director Pietro Righi Riva. \"I usually tell people, 'Oh, you should make a game in like six months', and I have tried to do that in the past,\" he tells me. \"This one just kind of got out of hand. I found an email yesterday, as I was looking for finishing the credits, about me discussing some story items in April 2017.\" And, while I am sure that most developers don't wish they'd been making a video game in the middle of the pandemic, I think the extra time may have allowed Santa Ragione to make something excellent.\nRead more",

If only mere words could convey just how much “like RimWorld” Stranded: Alien Dawn is – other 3D-ified clones exist, like last year’s Going Medieval, but here, even the exact spaceship-wrecking premise matches that of Ludeon Studios' seminal survival sim. \r\n\n \nRead more",

Luck can either be on your side, or you can earn it back by using your wits, carving out a victory you never thought possible. Other times, it all goes to pot and you get absolutely walloped, but hot damn if you didn't go down fighting. ORX has these moments in spades. Part deckbuilder, part roguelike and part tower defence, this is a real-time strategy game played by the seat of your pants, where a rolling deck of cards determines not only what kind of defences you can build, but also what buffs, spells and additional forces you can deploy to help defend your keep from the oncoming hordes. It's a gripping mix that's already claimed over a dozen hours of my time in recent weeks, and it's a number I can only see going up and up and up as it continues to develop in early access. \nRead more",

The Samsung Odyssey Ark, for the unfamiliar, is a kind of all-in-one entertainment screen: a mammoth 55in Mini LED panel that can act as a desktop gaming monitor or living room TV, complete with honking great speakers and built-in support for all the big game streaming services so you can play on it without a PC or console. Unlike other monitors of this magnitude, it can also rotate into portrait mode, leaving the top curve towering over you like an unsympathetic Victorian headmaster. \r\n\n\r\nI actually enjoy a touch of design madness creeping into the occasional piece of PC gear, regardless of whether it can hang with the best gaming monitors that sensible people might buy. What I experienced with the Odyssey Ark, however, was a device that too often veered onto the wrong side of senseless – when it was even working properly.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I'm a fundamentally un-grand person; I spend most days dressed like a 14-year-old fan of Tony Hawk, I do not like olives or scallops, and I'm unable to predict the consequences of actions if they exist outside of, say, a 12 month timeframe. A game like Victoria 3, where the whole point is making decisions that have country-wide effects and outcomes years in the future, is essentially operating in a different language to any I understand.\nI'm trying to learn new languages, though, so it's not an unwelcome challenge. The problem is that previewing Victoria 3 is quite an advanced level to dive in, the Paradox GSG equivalent of being a live translator for a UN summit when you're only just about able to read the French version of The Famous Five. In a presentation before I and others were let loose on the better part of a week with the game, it was claimed that Victoria 3 is the best yet for onboarding newcomers, with a deep and detailed tutorial system. And to that I say: kinda. Luckily, the AI in Victoria 3 is so advanced it's better at playing the game than I am.\nRead more",

Hyenas never gave me a chance.\nI sat in a 20-minute presentation of the game and tried my level best to understand SEGA's stab at a live-service FPS. Instead, I exited the booth with whiplash... and a sense of curiosity. Somewhere inside the game's insufferable tone is a kernel of cleverness, I just need to get my mitts on it to confirm my suspicions.

This latest rumination on voyeurism also delves into storytelling, sex, death, religion, love, lust, lies, pretence (as distinct from acting), power and self. That's a lot to pack into the partial, out of order clips of three different films, which manage to span both decades and careers. The central figure is Marissa Marcel, an almost-star actor who made three movies before disappearing. So the question you strive to answer, by looking through unedited takes and rehearsal footage, is: what happened to Marissa Marcel?\nIn typical Barlow fashion, the entirety of the footage isn't easily spooled through. From one starting clip you're able to watch it, flick back and forth through the recording, and pause it to use the in-game search tool to focus on a face or object on screen. Selecting it will then take you to that face or a similar object in a different clip, and eventually you build up a much fuller catalogue of footage.\nNow. Immortality also talks quite a bit about sex, in various ways and for various reasons, and there is female nudity. So yes, you can enhance! Zoom! on a tit. And the game will take you to another clip featuring a similar tit. Ba-dum, tsh!\nRead more",

Not to worry though, as I've once again gathered team RPS to tell me in detail about the games that caught their attention during Geoffcom 2022.\r\n\n\r\nMuch like our E3 roundup from earlier in the summer, each RPS staffer took ten minutes out of their day to wax lyrical about an upcoming project featured within the showcase. All eight (including yours truly, who thanks to Katharine actually remembered to contribute this time around) chose completely different games.

Green wrote the Kenneth Branagh versions of Agatha Christie’s Murder On The Orient Express and Death On The Nile. I guess that means he’s got experience of period settings.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Nonetheless, The Great War: Western Front, a combination of macro planning and tactical RTS battling revealed this week at Gamescom, has elected to lean right into WW1’s complexities and difficulties rather than dance around them.\n\r\nDevelopers Petroglyph have gone for historical accuracy in various ways, senior designer Chris Becker and audio director Frank Klepacki explain to me at a hands-off demo in Cologne. The soundtrack will even include licensed music from the era. But something they want to really hammer home is the brutality of the war: territory won’t be won in heroic pushes but slowly and bloodily, while collapsing morale is as much a danger as any advancing army.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The Dark Pictures Anthology is, well, a horror anthology, each a compact standalone scary game where you explore and deal with QTEs and hazardous choices, in the vein of Supermassive's smash hit Until Dawn. The idea, says Heaton, is that each one takes one or two horror sub-genres and mines them, maybe subverting the tropes here and there. Up next is The Devil In Me, inspired by the infamous Chicago serial killer H. H. Holmes. \n\"What I think we decided with The Dark Pictures games early on was that the next game in the series would be very different from the last game, because we want to keep it fresh, we want to give the audience new,\" Heaton explains. So, after a zombie ghost ship in Man Of Medan, the psychological witch hauntings in Little Hope, and military squad vs. vampire aliens in House Of Ashes, Heaton pitches The Devil In Me as kind of Saw meets The Shining. It's a serial killer slasher in a weirdo hotel, and it has a true crime element. And I have to say, it's probably the most excited I've been for a Dark Pictures entry.\nRead more",

And in a non-savoury twist, today it was being a member of the first squad to complete the Warhammer 40K: Darktide demo mission – the sweetest feeling of them all, and a perfect team-bonding exercise.\nThe bonus emotions? Surprise and... not being so surprised. Surprise that we'd accomplished such a feat, but not so much surprise in the game itself. It was, as expected, a good co-op FPS time!

There are people who love doing the management bits - the bean-counting, optimising the amount of salt on fries to make people thirsty and buy more drinks, paying close attention to demographics and average spends and that sort of kidney*. Then there are people who want to design a park full of cool-ass rides and different themed zones, a true magical wonderland. Inside this Park Beyond are two wolves, in other words, and each needs a different but equally robust set of tools to wrangle.\nAfter some hands on with an early build of Park Beyond, I have a little more faith that Limbic Entertainment are going to be able to pull it off. The toolset for building a rollercoast is, in particular, impressive. It's never been so easy to make a ride that breaks both the laws of physics and the laws of health and saftey. The coasters in this game are an absolute menace. In a good way.\nRead more",

Mojiken Studio say they were left feeling “manipulated and exploited” by the UK-based publisher’s actions. The Indonesian team have now terminated their contract with PQube and delayed A Space For The Unbound until they can find another publisher.\r\n\n \nRead more",

In fact I get the distinct impression it was one of the best, if not the one that most distilled the series' essence.\nThat essence has made its way into Blossom Tales II, a charming light adventure game in the classic \"going on an adventure\" sense rather than the \"rubbing every item on every other item until you're allowed to play again\" genre sense.\nYou're playing out a story playfully told by your grandfather, who's cast you as the wee hero of a village out to rescue your brother from the sinister Minotaur King. Both of you occasionally interject, sometimes prompting a decision that changes the game a little as your granddad amends things to your liking. It doesn't go to the full meta-narrative lengths of a Juarez Gunslinger with it, but it's a cute touch and keeps the framing relevant.\nRead more",

This is far from the classic fairytale story though. With a dark-gothic backdrop and mechanical killer robots to contend with, Pinocchio has his work cut out for him.

Testovalo se na jádru Linux 6.0-rc2 v kombinaci s X Server 1.21.1.3 + Wayland a Mesa 22.3 devel, což je kombinace obsahující již poměrně slušnou podporu pro Arc, avšak už nyní víme, že do Linuxu 6.1 míří další vylepšení.

With Tokyo Game Show kicking off in just a fortnight's time, now would be the perfect opportunity for a Japanese company to get the hype engine in motion for a brand new release. The stream will also feature a gallery of specially selected fan art reflecting the studio's games.\nThe Ryu ga Gotoku Studio TV #12.5 episode will premiere on the developer's official YouTube channel Thursday, September 8, at 20:00 JST. This is, obviously, an eye-watering 02:00 PT / 05:00 ET, but fret not, as we will be sure to have all of the pertinent details on the new trailer right here on Destuctoid, ready and waiting for you when you eventually roll outta bed and into your snakeskin shoes.\nThe post Team Yakuza has a ‘sneak peek trailer’ to show off next week appeared first on Destructoid.",

The publisher will host its event throughout one weekend, September 16 to 18.\nThe main show kicks off at 12 p.m. PT on Friday, September 16 on 3D Realms' Twitch and YouTube channels. There will be game reveals and updates, including news on Graven, Core Decay, and Ion Fury's expansion Aftershock.\nAlongside those, 3D Realms pals will be showing up to share some info too. Fulqrum, New Blood, HYPERSTRANGE, Dread XP, and Nightdive Studios will be sharing what's new. The showcase is expected to be more than an hour and a half long, highlighting both retro-inspired and contemporary FPS, and even some non-shooters.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-_etoZ9yko\nThe showcase will also include a LAN party in-person, in Aalborg, Denmark. And for those at home, a Steam sale and demo showcase will also run September 15 through 19, highlighting recently revealed titles, playable demos, and discounts on games.\nRealms deeper\nPrevious Realms Deep showcases have highlighted a decent mix of games, though it will most likely appeal to the old-school PC FPS fan the most. Games like the horror-themed shooter Cultic are due to make an appearance in some capacity, so if you like classic FPS action (a.k.a. \"boomer shooters\"), you'll probably find something to like here.\nThe showcase will extend into the weekend, too. 3D realms will be giving the spotlight to creators, developers, and personalities. Some independent games will also be taking the stage throughout the weekend too.\nAs the summer gaming news bonanza winds down, a demo showcase sounds pretty alright. Chances are high I'll find something interesting to put on my Steam wishlist during the weekend, and it's nice to be able to trial run a bunch of games without having to do all that travel.\nThe post 3D Realms is hosting its Realms Deep digital showcase in September appeared first on Destructoid.",

After initially looking like a late 2021 release, the sequel was bumped to May 2022, then pushed back again, to October 2022. Things happen.\nNow, there's another delay — but Endnight says it's the last time, and the new release date for Sons of the Forest, February 23, 2023, should stick. We also learned the price: $30.\nIn a short message relayed on Twitter, the developers said they've struggled to nail down the launch timing due to the game's scope. And rather than just spread the less-than-ideal news, they also attached a new 12-second gameplay clip.\nhttps://twitter.com/EndNightGame/status/1565012072681066496\nPreviously, Endnight said it hoped this would be the \"next step in survival games.\"\nHere's the latest summary: \"Sent to find a missing billionaire on a remote island, you find yourself in a cannibal-infested hellscape. Craft, build, and struggle to survive, alone or with friends, in this terrifying new open-world survival horror simulator.\"\nThe fleshy freakos will have to wait until next year. As much as Sons of the Forest would've hit the spot in October alongside all of my other annual horror media, it's important to come out strong in 2023. The Forest really grew its base on PS4, so if you're waiting for news on the console front, it's gonna be a long one. For now, the PC version is the focus.\nThe post Sons of the Forest slips to February 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Team Reptile says it will be dumping \"a lot more visuals\" this week, to show how the action-sports hybrid is shaping up.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-cE0PK9TeQ\nRise and grind\nThere's already been one drop today, highlighting the boostpacks players can use to do tricks. In the video example, Team Reptile shows off a Boost Trick, a 1080 spin. Landing this into a manual can keep the combo going, and coming at it from higher ground and landing in a manual boosts your speed.\nhttps://twitter.com/ReptileGames/status/1564979009099792384\nWhile it's a bummer we won't be seeing Bomb Rush Cyberfunk this year after all, it's good that Team Reptile is taking its time. The Lethal League developer has impressed me with just about every showing of Cyberfunk so far.\nIt's got the right style, and it's got great moves across the different styles of traversal. While a Jet Set style game might go for skates, Team Reptile has also shown off skateboards and BMX bikes too. Tack on some fantastic music and purported battles for turf, and yeah, I'm keen to see Team Reptile fully realize their vision.\nWe'll see what the team has in store for Bomb Rush Cyberfunk next summer.\nThe post Bomb Rush Cyberfunk delayed to summer 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Nowadays, the series has expanded beyond just the games, we've also released movies, merchandise, run eSports events, and done numerous collaborations to reach a wider audience. Seeing people from all kinds of backgrounds interacting with the series in its various forms has been a momentous driving force in keeping us going as we work towards its future.\"\n\nRight now, the main purpose of the site is sharing stories, via a social system of sorts. Capcom is collecting \"comment cards,\" which are like little information squares with someone's name (or alias), an avatar, and a little blurb about themselves and their favorite aspects of the Street Fighter series. Current and former Capcom employees, including Shuhei Matsumoto and Hideaki Itsuno, have contributed.\nThe other functionality of the site includes a history lesson page, dating back to the original Street Fighter game in 1987, through 2023's Street Fighter 6. While you can't click each game to get a full breakdown, select entries do have a separate pop-up page, including Street Fighter 1, 2, Alpha, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\nThe Street Fighter 35th anniversary landing is a cute little page, and no doubt is helping in terms of easing the wait for the next iteration.

It is important to note that Kadokawa Group remains the majority shareholder in FromSoftware, owning a huge 69.66% of the Dark Souls studios stock.

If you're afraid of the ocean, maybe sit this one out.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfniX3fH1l0\nDredge is the debut title from Christchurch-based Black Salt Games and publisher Team17, who has a knack for finding projects with intriguing new concepts in familiar genres.\nThis trailer is more about establishing the serene-meets-sinister vibe of Dredge, which is fine — it serves its purpose. But if you want to see gameplay, I'd check out the Steam page for some more illuminating screenshots and gifs. The lighting is fantastic.\nYer fond of me lobster, ain't ye?\nI like the idea of roaming between islands for quests, snatching up and selling sell fish, earning enough money to upgrade the ship, and heading out into the great unknown, potentially at my own peril. The inventory system also catches my eye as a perpetual Resident Evil 4 replayer; it's going to be fun to twist and turn odd-shaped items (in this case, fish and gear) to squeeze them all into a tight space to maximize trips.\n[caption id=\"attachment_342338\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1920\"] Making room for all the fish on the ship with a bit of \"inventory Tetris.\"[/caption]\nI'm hazy on how the nighttime mechanics work — how screwed are we? — but the scenery is unnerving. (And I'm generally not one to be too put off by freaky Subnautica-sized sea creatures.) As the creators of Dredge put it, you'll be able to \"strengthen your mind and use special abilities to survive trips out on the water after dark.\"\nDredge is launching in 2023 on Nintendo Switch, PC (via Steam), PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S.

You start with just one resource, the letter i.\nFrom there you can bend, rotate, reflect, and more, eventually making more complex letters. Then you can use those complex letters to form words, optimizing chains and hunting for secret letters.\n\nThe initial version of factori was made for the 2021 Game Maker's Toolkit Game Jam, where it took home the #1 spot. Developer Star Garden Games went on to refine the free demo into a 1.0 version, which you can currently purchase on Itch.io.\nSteam-powered factori\nToday's announcement, which brought this to my attention in the first place, is that Star Garden is now planning to bring factori to Steam. And it's not just a port of the 1.0 version from Itch, either.\nAccording to Star Garden's blog, factori will hit Steam with several new features. This includes a hard mode, which has restrictions on certain buildings that can be used. A dark mode is also on the way, which is always, always a good choice.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7gvQiYYDhQ\nThere are also more secrets, some quality-of-life improvements, and more to be announced. Basically, it sounds like Star Garden is adding a little more to the factori with each new release. And if you already dug the original idea, these new twists being added seem pretty interesting.\nThere's no ETA on the Steam version of factori just yet outside of a 2023 estimation. The team has set up several social platforms, including Discord, Twitter, and a newsletter, so you can be notified on any announcements.\nThe post Factori is a neat mash-up of letters and logic coming to Steam appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's yet another excuse to have a bunch of friends over and sit down to check out the new games. There are four completely new games in this pack, as well as the return of a revamped favorite:\nQuixort, a co-op trivia sorting game where players will have to sort a series of blocks in order thanks to the help of some little robots.\nJunktopia, a storytelling game where players are turned into frogs by an evil wizard, and must earn their way back into the wizard’s good graces by giving random objects amusing backstories to increase their values.\nRoomerang, a role-playing game where players take on the role of gameshow contestants and must answer prompts and avoid elimination.\nNonsensory, a laid-back game where players write, draw, and try to guess the silly things that their friends wrote and drew.\nAnd of course Fibbage 4, the return of a classic where players must bluff and get other players to believe their false answers.\nThe new trailer that dropped today gives a nice, quick overview of what each game entails if you're looking for a summary. There are also some adorable pugs involved, which I think is only due to their being adorable. Whatever, I'm not complaining.\nJackbox Party Pack 9 will be available on Nintendo Switch, Xbox, PlayStation, and Steam, with an announcement of the release date coming soon.\nThe post The Jackbox Party Pack 9 trailer is here appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Night City is waiting\nA new dive into the world of Cyberpunk is just around the corner. Netflix confirms today that its animated series Cyberpunk: Edgerunners will debut on September 13.\nThe anime, a collaboration with CD Projekt Red and Studio Trigger, also debuted a new and very-NSFW trailer today alongside the announcement.\nCyberpunk: Edgerunners follows David Martinez, a street kid who's trying to get by in Night City. He eventually becomes an edgerunner, or essentially a merc, similar to V in Cyberpunk 2077. Hopefully David's big heists go smoother than V's did.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtqIas3bYhg\nDavid winds up befriending other lost souls trying to get by in Night City, it seems. Lucy, one of the main characters of the series, has incredible technical abilities but is seeking a way out of Night City and away from her past.\nThe series is 10 episodes long, and all 10 will drop on September 13. No waiting around for each week's new episode here.\nA high-octane future\nI'd normally be a bit lukewarm on the concept of a Cyberpunk anime, seeing how 2077 didn't quite land for me or others. I've gone back since the release of the next-gen update for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, and while I dig a lot of the little improvements that have been made since launch, I'm still iffy on the overall game.\nWhat's kept me interested in this has been Studio Trigger's involvement. The animation house behind Kill la Kill and Promare has a well-regarded background in over-the-top action. And today's trailer is a mix of over-the-top action and Studio Trigger style. Edgerunners seems like it could at least make for a fun watch.\nNetflix has landed some solid animated game adaptations in the past, and Cyberpunk: Edgerunners has the benefit of drawing on both the video game and the tabletop franchise behind it. Of the many, many video game adaptations in the works, this could at least manage to be a fun, futuristic romp.\nThe post Cyberpunk: Edgerunners gets an intense new trailer and a date appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "One of the greats crosses a huge milestone\nTerraria is one of those games that has a simple premise, but it's so well executed, it's secured a spot as one of the best games of all time. I came to know it as sort of a 2D version of Minecraft (although that's something of an oversimplification), and it really gained traction in the mid-2010s when it got picked up by the Let's Play community on YouTube. Terraria is incredibly well-loved to this day, and is now one of the best-reviewed games on Steam. That's because Terraria has surpassed over a million reviews on the platforms, and while it's not the first title to do so, it is the first title with over a million reviews that has also maintained its \"overwhelmingly positive\" status.\nSpecifically, those reviews are still 97% positive, with 978,864 positive reviews and 21,444 negative ones. That lands Terraria as the second-best reviewed game on Steam of all time, after Valve's beloved classic Portal 2. However, it did manage to beat out Stardew Valley, Hades, and Left 4 Dead 2, just to name a few.\n\nLike Minecraft, Terraria's community is still going strong, and its developer Re-Logic is still producing new content for the game (as well as providing quality-of-life updates) over ten years after its release.\nThe newest update 1.4.4, called the Labor of Love update, will be released sometime in late September, and will also be the game's first simultaneous cross-platform launch for both console and PC.\nWhile I did have a brief Minecraft phase, I never did give Terraria a try, even after watching plenty of my favorite YouTubers give it a go back in the day. Based on those overwhelmingly positive reviews, however, it sounds like I have no choice but to give it a try one of these days. Another awesome game to add to the list!\nThe post Terraria has over a million reviews on Steam, and they’re still “overwhelmingly positive” appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Remember the Robots\nSquare Enix has released a new trailer for its upcoming Nintendo Switch port of NieR: Automata. The preview focuses on evocative protagonist 2B, the NieR hero who would become a legendary gaming icon.\n2B — or to offer her full moniker YoRHa No.2 Type B — is a YoRHa all-purpose battle android created to aid humanity in its war with The Machines. Adept in all manner of fighting abilities and coded to operate with cold and ruthless efficiency, 2B is one of mankind's finest tools in its efforts to reclaim the planet. As NieR fans will be fully aware, however, there is more than 2B than meets the eye, and her single-minded coldness will be put to the test on the battlefield when faced with the chaos, disaster, and \"death\" of her equally disposable friends and colleagues.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqHMMLn00ts\nWhile NieR: Automata launched as something of a cult release, PlatinumGames challenging action-RPG would find itself pushed into the mainstream, thanks in no small part to 2B's elegant, engaging, and undeniably sexy demeanor. Operating as both the heart and the brain of NieR: Automata's narrative 2B — alongside her battle buddies 9S, A2, and not forgetting Pod — offer the only real semblance of actual humanity in a bleak, miserable, and seemingly endless war of attrition.\nNieR: Automata The End of YoRHa Edition was first announced during June's Nintendo Direct. The port will feature a faithfully recreated adaptation of the 2017 modern classic, bundled with all of the RPG's post-release content which includes additional missions and character costumes. In addition to this DLC, the Switch port will feature a small range of exclusive skins for the trio of protagonists.\nNieR: Automata: End of YorHa Edition launches October 6 on Nintendo Switch. Pre-orders for the physical release are now live at the official Square Enix store.\nThe post NieR: Automata Switch trailer reacquaints us with the iconic 2B appeared first on Destructoid.",

In the upcoming sequel, Kratos and Atreus must stave off a preordained catastrophe, calling on old and new friends to succeed against Asgard and, hopefully, prevent all-out war.  \nI spoke with God of War veteran and newly appointed director Eric Williams as well as some lead UX, combat, and level designers about their experience crafting the long-awaited sequel and the most significant changes coming to the action and exploration loops.

A new cinematic trailer shown during Gamescom reveals a November release date, and it runs down the wacky cast of characters and why you'll be riddling them with bullets. \nThe largely CG trailer sprinkles in a bit of in-game action, though you should check out this previous gameplay video for a better taste of the over-the-top combat. We’re introduced to Grave’s allies who band together to take on a fearsome foursome of antagonists looking to rule the world (probably). Fans of the PS2 games and the anime that spawned from them will be happy to know that G.O.R.E. looks as bombastic and absurd as they'd expect. Newcomers that enjoy bullets, blood, and insanity will likely feel right at home. \n\n\nGungrave G.O.R.E. launches November 22 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Pre-ordering nets you a special Grim Reaper skin designed by former Tango Gameworks designer Ikumi Nakamura, who is working on G.O.R.E. as a character artist.",

As far as why, there’s no official reason as of yet but considering Netflix’s past, it’s likely that Resident Evil didn’t meet expectations in terms of both critical and audience response. The show will now join many other shows canceled after just one season at the streamer including Cowboy Bebop, The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance, and more.\nDeadline notes that Resident Evil’s release came right after the highly anticipated Season 4 of Stranger Things, which might have led to its less-than-stellar first weekend on the service. However, the series still debuted in the number two spot, behind Stranger Things, pulling in 72.7 million watch hours. Deadline reports that viewers watched Resident Evil for 73.3 million hours in its second week, taking the number three spot on Netflix, before dropping out of Netflix’s Top 10 by week three. \nThis isn’t Netflix’s first foray into the world of Resident Evil, though. Its 2021 movie, Resident Evil Infinite Darkness, holds that title, but that anime series wasn’t well-received either. For more about the series, check out this retrospective video that looks back at 25 years of Resident Evil. \n[Source: Deadline]\nDid you watch Resident Evil on Netflix? What did you think of it?

Former editor John Carson scored the game an 8.25 out of 10, writing in his review that, \n“Despite its minor shortcomings, Nobody Saves the World kept me enthralled from start to finish as I leveled my way through form ranks for the next body or ability to work with.

Set during the Three Kingdoms era of China, you'll battle invading demons as a soldier using a blend of graceful swordplay and Chinese martial arts based on the Five Phases philosophy. The trailer shows off the many demonic foes awaiting your blade, including a bipedal tiger that is swiftly kicked out of the way by the protagonist. \n\n\nNext month, those attending Tokyo Game Show will be the first to play Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty via a show floor demo. Everyone else will have to wait until early 2023 to experience the game on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. It will also be available on Xbox Game Pass at launch.",

          "description": "Yesterday, Sony Interactive Entertainment announced it will increase the price of PlayStation 5 consoles in various non-U.S. territories due to global economic conditions such as inflation. Microsoft then declared later that day that it will not be doing the same with the Xbox Series X/S. Now, Nintendo has chimed in on the matter. \nIn a statement to Eurogamer, Nintendo reiterates a quote from president Shuntaro Furukawa, made in June, in which he stated the company has \"no plans to increase the trade price of its hardware.” Furukawa made this statement during the 82nd Annual General Meeting Shareholders that month, in which he also said: \n\"While we cannot comment on pricing strategies, we currently do not have any plans to change the price of our hardware due to inflation or increased procurement costs in each country. We will determine our future pricing strategies through careful and continued deliberations.”\nAlthough the PlayStation 5's price will remain unchanged in the U.S. (for now), both versions of the console have become more expensive in Canada, Europe, the UK, Mexico, Japan, and Australia. The price hikes have already gone into effect in those regions except Japan, which occurs on September 15. \nThe only time Nintendo significantly adjusted the price of its current consoles was last fall, when it permanently reduced the cost of the standard Switch model in the UK and Europe. Nintendo has yet to do the same in the U.S. \n[Source: Eurogamer]",

Over three minutes of gameplay footage shows off the carnage you'll unleash against adversaries, both artificial and organic. \nPlayers wield melee weapons or firearms in one hand and more, shall we say, unconventional abilities in the other. That includes electrifying targets with lightning bolts, tossing them around with a telekinesis-like power, freezing foes solid with an ice blast, or using wires to hijack machines. The action-packed video shows off how players can creatively combine their arsenal to dismantle and disembowel anything standing in their way. \n\n\nAtomic Heart was first announced in 2018 and takes place in an alternative futuristic version of the Soviet Union in 1955. Robotic technology flourished post World War 2, allowing humanity to create a high-tech utopia. Unfortunately, these mechanical helpers have started rebelling against their human creators. If that wasn’t enough, killer mutants born from secret experiments have also run amok. Players control private agent P-3, who embarks on a secret mission to get to the bottom of what’s caused this seemingly perfect society to collapse and clean up this mess. \nAtomic Heart launches this fall for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

He believes that this is a good thing for the gaming industry in the long run. \n“[It] is something we’re just going to see less and less of,” when discussing the idea of specific games being exclusive to a single device. “Maybe you happen in your household to buy an Xbox, and I buy a PlayStation, and our kids want to play together, and they can’t because we bought the wrong piece of plastic to plug into our television.\n“We really love being able to bring more players in reducing friction, making people feel safe, secure when they’re playing, allowing them to play with their friends, regardless of what device – I think in the long run that is good for this industry. And maybe in the short run, there’s some people in some companies that don’t love it.

          "description": "Pentiment, Obsidian Entertainment's medieval narrative adventure title, is coming on November 15. We first learned of the project during the Xbox Games Showcase in June. \nThe game's art direction emulates medieval manuscript illustrations and woodcut prints while the story unfolds in 16th-century Bavaria. You play as an illustrator who becomes wrapped up in a series of murders over 25 years. You'll engage in choice-driven conversations where your decisions steer the plot and create lasting consequences in a tale that expands into a larger conspiracy. Check out the original reveal trailer below to see it in action. \n\n\nPentiment is made by a small team within Obsidian led by director Josh Sawyer. You can pick it up on Xbox consoles and PC (day one on Game Pass). It will be the second game that Obsidian ships this year, following the 1.0 release of Grounded in September.",

So, it’s only fitting that Gamescom 2022 ended with two trailers (cinematic and gameplay) for the long-overdue zombie-slaying sequel. \n\n\nWe follow a chiseled survivor named Jacob as he leaves the safety of his (bloodied) condo and ventures into a Californian hellscape swarming with undead. He kills several adversaries with an empty rifle, jutting it through their rotten bodies and smashing their heads against the pavement with its wooden butt. \nThe gameplay trailer shows scenic beaches, forsaken suburbs, cratered city streets, and still-lit carnivals. In what is one of the most graphic clips I’ve ever seen at a game show, we watch as the player-character clobbers zombies with blunt objects, jump-kicks adversaries off roofs (parkour mechanics?), and shoots gasoline tanks to engulf hordes in flames.\n\n\nDead Island 2 is a first-person action RPG with six playable characters. And according to a designer who appeared onstage, the gory romp has an irreverent, pulpy tone and gameplay that’s all about “experimenting with your preferred zombie-slaying methods.”\nDead Island 2 punches and kicks its way onto PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on February 3.",

Plenty of blood is shed as humans are used as lab rats in Murkoff Corporation's Saw-like tests. In some cases, the tests just look like torture and flatout murder.\nThe game looks overly graphic, yet also brings about comparisons to BioShock's tone and storytelling conventions. It'll be interesting to see how the narrative sews all of these wild experiements together. The Outlast Trials is designed as both a single-player and cooperative experience. The player clearly is free to explore at certain points, and appears to rely on trap-like devices to fight back and escape. In one sequence, we see two players helping each other up to higher ground.\nThe footage concludes with news of a short closed beta running from October 28 to November 1.
