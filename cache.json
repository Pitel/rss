As such, they based it on the syntax of English, meaning the order of words would closely follow that of the English language. This allowed Hughes to recognise where certain words were placed when compared to his native language, thus allowing him to convey subtleties and nuance when recording his lines.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "One of my absolute most favouritest Steam Deck cases, besides the one you get for free with the Steam Deck OLED, is the Dbrand Project Killswitch. It’s not so much a carrying vessel as a hardened second skin, providing protection without all the bag-hogging bulk of a traditional case – while throwing in handy bonuses like a clip-on kickstand and grippy thumbstick covers. For owners of the Asus ROG Ally, the recent launch of a Project Killswitch for their own handheld PC should therefore represent glad tidings with extra gladness, even if it won’t also fit the upcoming ROG Ally X.\nThank the new device’s bigger battery, wider SSD and reworked connection layout for that particular lack of forwards compatibility, as the ROG Ally X’s thicker dimensions will make it just slightly too beefy to slip into the Killswitch’s skintight silicone. A shame, but at least it makes a quality addition to the original Ally right this second. I’ve been manhandling one for a week now, and it’s just as practical and protective as the Steam Deck version.\nRead more",

But one thing has been brought to order: its release date. It's coming to early access on August 14th, while a new trailer (below) shows horse riding, flame throwing, and speed boating. My favourite moment is when a man pumps magic gas into a room full of people doing zumba, and it turns them all into giants, and they freak out and start smashing the walls in a panic.\nRead more",

South Of Midnight seems no less vivid, but a lot more assured in its God Of War-style action... and it's perhaps a bit less intriguing, as a consequence.

I reviewed State Of Decay the first and thought it was a cool scrappy underdog next to larger zombie-botherers such as Left 4 Dead or DayZ. State Of Decay 2, on the other hand, I found to be disappointing - the same game with more money behind it in a way that seemed to magnify its faults. The threequel? I have tempered expectations, but I do want it to be good.\nRead more",

          "description": "Computer Artworks' 2002 videogame adaptation of 1982 movie The Thing was a ghoulish and gripping third-person shooter with some terrific mechanics that weren't quite fleshed out, flesh being the operative word. For instance: you can enlist surviving soldiers as squadmates, but are they really surviving soldiers, or are they human-shaped warrens of teeth and mandibles poised to split open and shower you in digestive juices? You have a limited supply of blood tests with which to determine whether any people you rescue are Things in waiting - and even as you're worrying about them, they're casting suspicious eyes at you, care of some embryonic \"trust\" and \"fear\" systems.\nSadly, much of this acute paranoia could be easily gamed out in practice - back in 2002, I deduced that contact with enemies increased the odds of infection, and adopted a policy of shooting anyone who'd been in my squad for too long. But it's the kind of system an intelligent remake could pounce upon and have fun with. Sadly, Nightdive are not working on a remake, like their previous System Shock remakes. They've just announced that they're making a remaster, due later this year. Still, I will take a Thing remaster and thus, the opportunity to write more about The Thing, over no remaster at all.\n Read more",

          "description": "Enough moons ago to qualify as quite a lot of moons but not so much for me to categorise them as ‘many’, Alice Bee wrote about an Itch game called Kevin Costner’s Waterworld - a fully playable extrapolation of a Simpsons’ joke from three decades ago. Simpsons jokes from three decades making up most of my sense of humour, I of course thought it was brilliant. And yet, I couldn’t shake a singular, burning question: What if this, but not joke? Enter Tides Of Tomorrow. Ok, so I actually don't know if it has anything in common with Waterworld aside from having lots of water everywhere. Still, I'll never pass up an opportunity for a crispy Simpsons reference.\n \nRead more",

With the ambitious project nearing a decade in its own development, though, those games have now taken on their own real history in addition to their made-up one.

Firstly, this game clearly contains a non-zero quantity of blades, from whacking great axes to katanas. Secondly, I do not accept the premise that these are phantom blades. They are very obviously non-spectral, going by the amount of stabbing and clanging on show in the video. With these potentially ruinous caveats out of the way, I am now free to tell you more about a game that looks like it's out to eat Sekiro's lunch.\r\n \nRead more",

Inasmuch as can be told in the absence of dialogue or a text preamble, the naked man wants to murder you because you, and not he, are in possession of a hat. The hat makes you look like an eraser pencil from Forbidden Planet. It's the kind of headgear worn by the kind of criminal Batman's too grown-up to fight anymore. But it has, nonetheless, roused in this under-dressed stranger a sense of Dionysian frenzy. He will do anything for that hat - hewing your arms off, ripping your intestines out, tearing the skin from your ribcage. And you, in turn, will do anything to rob him of that mattock, because by the gods, it looks a lot more dangerous than the candlestick you're trying to fend him off with.\r\n\n\r\nThere are many such lost souls in the bleak, midnight world of the Half Sword demo - all lurking near candle-lit piles of randomly spawned hammers, stools, barrels, axes and lengths of wood, all subject to unforgivably authentic physics and cursor-based attacks that conspire to transform every scuffle into a Monty Python blooper reel.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I got to try out the game and talk to Director Naoki Yoshida (aka Yoshi-P) about new Jobs and the difficulty of incorporating fan feedback (not to mention the reasons the Warrior of Light has such great skin - you'll see). But how can the Square Enix possibly hope to follow the highs of Endwalker, including space travel and a fight against the physical embodiment of sorrow? By taking us on holiday, of course. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Hollywood Animal is a management sim about turning a bankrupt movie studio into a money printing machine, set in Hollywood’s golden age. While a Frostpunk 2 or Manor Lords might have you grapple with the elements, here it’s all about balancing a fickle audience and Tinseltown’s seedy underbelly. Maybe making some worthwhile art, too? Sorry, did I say ‘worthwhile art’? I meant to say “lots of money.” Let’s get clicking!\nFirst up, I need to name my studio (I settle on Horace's Revenge) as well as my crack new team of business bastards. There’s my chief legal officer, Jebediah End. My CCO, Anne Egg, and CFO, Rummy McLastdrink. He doesn’t have a sauce problem, because obviously I wouldn’t put him in charge of money if he did. In the wreckage of the studio, we find an unedited film reel hidden in the waffles n’ cocaine cupboard. It’s a noir thriller named ‘Messenger Of Death’. Whatever influential critic is currently directing this era’s discourse has chosen to categorise each film as genre percentages (‘60% detective/40% thriller’), and setting (‘modern American city’.) Let’s just hope those pigs in the stands recognise a solid gold picture when they see one!\n \nRead more",

But there's one thing I didn't flesh out in the preview and that's the DLC's standalone levelling system, brought to our attention a month or so ago. Well, here I am to flesh it out! Be warned, though, the role of the system is a jarring thing to condense into words.\nRead more",

Right, onwards.\nLife In Jars is this YouTuber I've followed for a while. He makes videos that might involve, say, scooping up some puddle water, leaving it in a sealed jar for a while, then coming back to it a few months later. He'll report on the results, which are often tremendous. Look at the LIFE in that jar! The little wriggly lads just wriggling around. The blobs whose job is to float and squidge indiscriminately. A lovely bit of fauna sloshing about there, like a forest dwelling for those who implement the five-second rule. It's a reminder that bog water is rather beautiful, actually.\nHaving spent three hours with Elden Ring expansion Shadow Of The Erdtree's opening area, I can't help but think of Life In Jars. What resides in the shadowy dome of the Big Tree is horrendous! Miserable! The forgotten creatures and their crumbling homes are grim. But oh my word, the shadows have spawned a beautiful disasterpiece. Just, errr, those other jars? The fun guys with the scoopy arms and little legs? Yeah. I have bad news.\nRead more",

Please feel free to try any of these on for size: Grunn’s shear sound is the Wilhelm Scream of gardening equipment, sure to be referenced for decades to come. Grunn’s shear sound wormed its way past my eyes and into parts of my brain I’d previously assumed could only be accessed by either masterful ASMR or irresponsibly long Q-tips. I used to have anxiety, but now, my only fear in life is that Grunn’s grass will run out, so I no longer have a reason to click away with its shears. Play Grunn, innit. There are, by the way, lots of other things to like about it, although I cannot hear them over the wonderful sound of these shears.\n \nRead more",

The hardest track ever created in Trackmania was published by a team of mappers on May 4th, bringing an intimidating 16-floor tower called Deep Dip 2 into the racing game. It became a magnet for competitive drivers after a prize pool of over $30,000 was offered to the first three players to conquer its hellish heights. The prize has yet to be claimed. Even today, determined racers continue to bang their heads against the brutally designed course, featuring icy surfaces, curving rails, and perilous loop-the-loops that hang kilometres about the ground. Some players have parked their hopes and given up. But others persevere. The top three players have reached the final floor and currently stand shoulder to shoulder, eyes focused on the prize.\r\n\r\n \nRead more",

Render compositor je přepsán, jeho běh je nyní až několikanásobně rychlejší. Rychleji probíhají i undo operace.",

In addition to going up to 16 cores versus 8 with the Xeon E-2400 series, the more competitive pricing, the 3D V-Cache SKUs, and 28 PCIe lanes rather than 20, the AMD EPYC 4004 models also support DDR5-5200 memory where as the Intel Raptor Lake E-2400 models are bound to DDR5-4800.

          "description": "If you’re a fan of Bleach and are playing Type Souls in Roblox, you may be wondering if and when you’ll reach Rukongai, the largest, most populated area of Soul Society. Good news; you can. This is how you get to the Rukon District.\n\n\nThe most important requirement for getting into the Rukon District is that you have to become a Soul Reaper. Don’t worry; we have a guide to help you out with that. If you’re already progressing through another class (Hollow or Quincy), you can use a Soul Ticket to reroll your character.\n\n\nGetting to Rukon District is a part of becoming a Soul Reaper. To start this off, you first have to die. I’m not sure I have to explain this, but you can either let yourself be killed by a Hollow or get “help” from another player.\n\n\nOnce you die, you’ll become a Lost Soul and be taken to Karakura Town. There, you’ll want to find Kisuke (a guy sitting on a bench wearing a striped hat roughly in the middle of town). Tell him you want to become a Soul Reaper, and he’ll set you off as a Shinigami. Directly after that conversation, you’ll be taken to the Rukon District.\n\n\nThere you have it. You’ve made it to Rukongai. From here, as a Shinigami, you can join a division and start tackling their missions. It’s your first step into actually playing Type Souls as a Soul Reaper.\n\nThe post How to get to the Rukon District in Type Soul appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Despite being a huge success, Oblivion has no doubt been overshadowed both by time and its loftier successor, Skyrim. Still, The Elder Scrolls 4 exists as a major player in the RPG genre, but that hasn't stopped someone from wanting to blend the two games together. Sort of.\n\n\nThe \"Skyrim Border\" mod comes from the mind of Nexus Mods user JoopvanDie, and is essentially a way of bringing a bit of TES5 to Cyrdoiil, the province where Oblivion takes place. Anyone who knows the map of Tamriel is aware that the latter game borders the former, though players are unable to cross.\n\n\nImage via JoopvanDie/Nexus Mods.\n\n\nHowever, JoopvanDie invites us to step a little bit into Skyrim, giving us a small area to trek around in, perhaps breathe in a bit of that cold, dragon-y air.\n\n\nJust a quick pop by to say hello\n\n\nAs the name suggests, the mod by no means allows you to traverse the whole of Skyrim's landscape or cross over into any other part of Tamriel that's not officially part of the game. That would be far too ambitious. And, in fact, there is already a fan-made project that covers that idea.\n\n\nWhat this does is bring just a little bit of the border within our grasp inside Oblivion. While there's not a huge amount there – no new quests, for example – there's enough that's worth a quick visit. This includes:\n\n\n\nan area for you to explore\n\n\none small village with NPCs\n\n\nfew small caves\n\n\ntwo ingredients\n\n\none new creature (Frost troll)\n\n\nnew armor and a medieval Scandinavian(ish) helmet\n\n\ntreasure hunting\n\n\n\nIf you want to get to the area, the description says to go to the Echo Cave (shown just west of Bruma, which you can see in the image above) and follow the road to the northwest. Say hi to Paarthurnax for me if he's there.\n\nThe post This Oblivion mod lets you explore Skyrim, but only a tiny bit appeared first on Destructoid.",

With GSC Game World having to flee to Prague to escape the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the future of the long-awaited horror FPS remained uncertain at one point.\n\n\nWe know it had to be delayed for fairly obvious reasons, pushing the release date back to September 5. Now, the latest trailer has been released, and it's really whetting my appetite for Heart of Chornobyl.\n\n\n\n\nThe gloomy backdrop of the Exclusion Zone has never looked prettier than in the \"Time of Opportunities\" teaser the developer put out yesterday. While many of us strongly suspect Stalker 2 is going to be quite something, I now cannot wait for it to finally arrive.\n\n\nHeart and soul\n\n\nThat's not to say I was ignorant of the game until now. Though I admit, I haven't really played any of the other entries in the series, aside from a brief stint of the first game. But that doesn't mean it hasn't intrigued me, largely because it's been fifteen years since GSC released the last installment, Call of Pripyat.\n\n\nAt any rate, the new trailer really shows off what's almost certainly going to be a pretty solid horror FPS. I know I'm not alone in saying that it gives me mad Chernobylite vibes, which I have played and did enjoy.\n\n\nIt has, indeed, been a long and worrisome road for the development team, but whatever tribulations have come their way, they've remained steadfast in their completion of Stalker 2. I truly hope it pays off for them, because it looks fantastic. Look, just go wishlist the game on Steam already.\n\nThe post The new Stalker 2 trailer is really selling the game for me appeared first on Destructoid.",

Here's how you can get early access to the BO6 beta. \n\n\nAll eyes were on May 9's Call of Duty Direct, which gave us our first look at the game, round-based Zombies, and new movement mechanics that could change how CoD is played forever. We also received confirmation that the game would receive an open beta, with early access available if you want to maximize your playtime. \n\n\nIf that sounds like your cup of tea, here's how you can get early access to the Black Ops 6 beta. \n\n\nBlack Ops 6 early access open beta explained\n\n\nIf you want to play Black Ops 6's early access open beta, you'll need to pre-order the game. The good news is that both the standard and Vault editions of BO6 offer early access, so if you don't want to drop the extra money on Operator Packs or Mastercraft Collection weapon skins, you don't have to. \n\n\nThis also works for Digital and Physical editions of the game, although the process through which you will get your code will be different depending on your version. We'll update this article once Treyarch and Activision have confirmed the process for getting into the early access beta. \n\n\nBoth editions get early access. Image via Activision\n\n\nThere will be open beta periods too though, so if you don't want to preorder the game just yet, you don't have to. You won't be able to play as much of the beta as those who do preorder, however, so it's up to you to decide how important that is. \n\n\nDoes the Black Ops 6 beta have a release date?\n\n\nNo, the Black Ops 6 beta doesn't have a release date just yet. However, based on previous years, I expect it will launch in August or September, and last over two weekends.

This was confirmed by Activision and Treyarch, who stated that because Black Ops 6 is set in a different universe to the Modern Warfare franchise, and is set over 30 years in the past, it just wouldn't make sense for modern guns to be available to use. \n\n\nWill MW2 and MW3 weapons carry forward to Warzone?\n\n\nYes, MW2 and MW3 weapons will be available to use in Warzone. This is because Warzone is separated out from the wider Call of Duty narrative universe, and the battle royale won't be linked to Black Ops 6's campaign. \n\n\nThis means that when the BO6 update launches for Warzone, you'll not only have the existing guns that we have today, but all the new weapons from Treyarch's title added into the mix too. \n\n\n\n\nBlack Ops 6 launches on October 25, so look forward to a brand-new set of weapons when the game drops. \n\nThe post Do MW2 & MW3 weapons carry into Black Ops 6 and Warzone?

          "description": "The announcement of a new Gears of War game, titled Gears of War: E-Day, was easily one of the highlights of the recent Xbox Games Showcase. It's status as a prequel, however, means fans are still left wanting for a follow-up to Gears 5's storyline, but it sounds like Microsoft and The Coalition haven't ruled out a new sequel for later done the line.\n\n\nIn an Xbox Wire blog post discussing Gears of War: E-Day, series brand director Nicole Fawcette assures that the team at The Coalition are \"super proud about Gears 4 and Gears 5\" and are \"not retreating from that storyline in any way.\" As for why The Coalition has opted to do a prequel next rather than a Gears 6, Fawcette only says, \"In [this] moment, we had an opportunity to write our next step, and this one just felt too good to miss.\"\n\n\n\n\nSet 14 years before the events of the first Gears of War game, E-Day will depict the Locust's first attack on humanity, and serve as an origin story of sorts for protagonists Marcus Fenix and Dom Santiago. As such, Microsoft insists that E-Day isn't a spin-off, but a full-fledged entry in the Gears of War series, saying, \"Everything that happens in E-Day will shape the future of Gears of War for the better.\" \n\n\nWith any luck, this means Gears 6 will happen eventually and continue the storyline that began with Gears 4. Maybe E-Day will even set up a few plot points for it? It's just a shame that the wait for it is going to be even longer than expected. Gears 5 came out in 2019 and with E-Day lacking a release window, there's no telling when any hypothetical Gears 6 will launch and resolve Gears 5's cliffhanger ending. Especially with how long development times for big-budget games are nowadays. Even so, E-Day has got fans excited, if only to experience a new Gears of War on modern hardware, and spend time with Marcus and Dom once more.\n\nThe post Gears of War: E-Day may be a prequel, but it doesn’t mean the developers have forgotten about Gears 5 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will require your PC or console to be connected to the internet at all times to use texture streaming, including when you're playing the game's Campaign mode which doesn't feature any multiplayer elements. \n\n\nThis was confirmed on the official Activision website, with the section about the decision reading: \"To deliver the highest-quality visuals while also reducing the game's overall storage space on your hard drive, Black Ops 6 will use texture streaming across all game modes. This means you'll need a continuous internet connection to play any game mode, including Campaign.\"\n\n\nThis means that if your internet goes down, or you simply don't have a connection at any time, you won't be able to play Black Ops 6, even though the Campaign doesn't feature multiplayer.\n\n\nYou'll not see any of Black Ops 6's game modes without an internet connection. Image via Activision \n\n\nTexture streaming is a tool used in Call of Duty to provide extra detail and quality to the graphics of your game while attempting to keep the game's file size as small as possible. Instead of bundling these graphics into the file to be installed on your computer, on-demand texture streaming downloads them via the internet while you're playing. \n\n\nActivision developed it to \"reduce the game's overall package size by removing certain textures rarely used or encountered by players. If players encounter an Operator or Weapon that uses a high-resolution texture, it will be streamed to the PC [or console's] cache as needed.\"\n\n\nWhile this is massive for keeping our hard drives from filling up, it does mean that we'll never be able to play the game without an internet connection. However, this trade-off is worth it for many players, and I'd be inclined to agree.\n\n\nBlack Ops 6 will be released on October 26 and will launch with two round-based Zombies maps and a traditional multiplayer prestige system. \n\nThe post Black Ops 6 will require a constant internet connection—Even for campaign appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Developer Frost Giant Studios revealed its upcoming RTS Stormgate's third playable faction today as the Celestial Armada. An ancient and advanced civilization, the Celestial Armada traverses the universe in massive world-ships ruled by the Sovereigns, immortal beings. Frost Giant also announced an August 13 release date for the RTS Early Access to begin.\n\n\n\n\nEssentially space nomads, the playstyle of the Celestial Armada looks rather unique compared to the two other factions. The Celestial Armada is built around the Arcship, a flying HQ that assists with the creation of new bases rather than utilizing builder units like the other factions. Similar to the Protoss from StarCraft, buildings constructed by the Celestial Armada will generate a cascade field that expands the possible building area for the faction.\n\n\nInterestingly, the Celestial Armada does not have to worry about supply. This faction starts with the max cap of 300, and can build as many units as their resources allow. Primarily focused on buildings rather than units, the Celestial Armada also has to juggle maintaining an efficient power grid by building power-generating structures to support the many buildings it will construct.\n\n\nThose wanting to try out the upcoming RTS early can do so by purchasing a Founder's pack for access on July 30, or wait until it releases for free into Early Access on August 13, 2024 on PC via Steam.\n\nThe post Stormgate third faction revealed to be the Celestial Armada, RTS enters Early Access on August 13 appeared first on Destructoid.",

During the CoD Direct, Treyarch dropped a boatload of information about the campaign, multiplayer, and zombies. Key highlights included 16 new multiplayer maps, a new omnidirectional movement system, two round-based zombies maps, and a spy action thriller campaign set in a post-cold war landscape in 1991. \n\n\nWhen is CoD Next 2024?\n\n\n\n\nCoD Next 2024 will be held on August 28. Treyarch did not confirm a start time for the event. For reference, CoD Next 2023 started at noon est. \n\n\nHow to watch CoD Next 2024\n\n\nCoD Next 2024 will be streamed on the official Call of Duty YouTube and Twitch channels. As was the case last year, we expect there to be exclusive Twitch drops and YouTube rewards for watching the streams. Fans can also watch the event from their favorite streamers' prospective, as dozens of content creators will be flown out to show off their skills. \n\n\nWhat to expect from Cod Next 2024\n\n\nFans certainly get their money's worth from CoD Next events. In 2023, Activision gifted fans with a four-hour livestream. Over 100 content creators were flown out and played several Modern Warfare 3 matches across a few of the title's maps. Then, those streamers played several Warzone matches, and gave players a first look at Urzikstan. In between, there were developer interviews filled with new nuggets about every game mode. \n\n\nCoD Next 2024 will most likely follow a similar format and provide gameplay footage from some of the 16 new multiplayer maps. Most Warzone information remains shrouded in mystery, as Treyarch kept tight-lipped about the battle royale during the CoD Direct. \n\nThe post How to watch CoD Next 2024: Black Ops 6 event date, streams, more appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "For the first time since 2021, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 brings back round-based zombies. \n\n\nAs part of Call of Duty Direct, Treyarch confirmed that Black Ops 6 will launch with two round-based zombie maps. Liberty Falls is set in West Virginia during the day, while Terminus is set in a black site area with a dark setting. \n\n\nZombies in Black Ops 6 continues the narrative that started in Black Ops 6. Treyarch confirmed a mix of new and returning power-ups and a healthy dose of easter eggs for players to put their detective hats on to solve. In addition, the movement overhaul will also be available for players in Zombies. This means that players will be able to slide, dive, and sprint in any direction, and the intelligent movement option allows you to move forward and auto sprint, auto mantle, and auto crouch. Lastly, the new Supine Prone lets you rotate your body while laying prone. Treyarch also teased that there will be new zombie-exclusive features too. \n\n\n\n\nThis has been a long time coming for Zombies fans. Treyarch opted to turn away from round-based gameplay in CoD Vanguard and instead focused on players completing objectives, which went down poorly with the Zombies community. The decision went down poorly, so the development team backtracked and added round-based maps at the end of the title's life cycle. As it turned out, those two maps wound up being the last two round-based environments for several years. \n\n\nThankfully, players won't have to wait much longer, as Treyarch plans to unveil new information about the beloved game mode in the following weeks. \n\nThe post CoD Black Ops 6 finally ends the round-based Zombies map drought appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "A new storybook-aesthetic survival game, Winter Burrow, has been announced at the Xbox Games Showcase, featuring cute mice trying to outlast a harsh winter.\n\n\nThe story involves a young city mouse returning to her rural childhood home, only to find it abandoned and in disarray. Since her aunt was supposed to be care taking the property, she sets out in search for her, making new friends with the local critters along the way.\n\n\nIn order to stave off the bitter bite of winter, she will have to craft equipment like knitted swearers and adorable little leaf snowshoes that will help traverse the snowy fields. She will have to scavenge supplies to rebuild her modest home and prove herself capable to the community of mice they left behind for the city.\n\n\nThe cold is not the only danger waiting outside her door though, as the wilderness is inhabited by aggressive bugs that pose a threat to our little rodent protagonist. She'll have to adapt to new challenges and fill out her survival handbook in order to learn how to support herself.\n\n\nPlayers can spend their time crafting, cooking, or decorating their burrows at a relaxed pace, as the developers at Pine Creek Games strive to ensure a cozy experience for everybody.\n\n\nFounded in Denmark but operated remotely, the development studio had their premier game picked up by Noodlecake, a Canadian indie publishing group that funds new talent after finding success with their own Super Stickman Golf games in the mobile market.\n\n\nWe'll all have to wait out another winter before we can get our hands on Winter Burrow when it comes out on GamePass, Xbox Series X|S and PC (Steam) in 2025.\n\n\nThis is a developing story.\n\nThe post Winter Burrow emerges from hibernation in 2025 appeared first on Destructoid.",

As part of that, <a href=\"https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2024/06/09/hoping-to-sprint-in-the-right-direction\">we learned the series is implementing a new movement system</a>, bringing back round-based Zombies and Classic Prestige, and taking us to the year 1991 for its campaign. We also learned another key piece of information: when we'll be able to play it.</p>\n\n<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on October 25. Alongside that, players can expect a campaign that hopes to instill a sense of paranoia and intrigue with the Black Ops team going rogue in order to remove an entity that has infiltrated the highest levels of government, as well as a competitive multiplayer suite that includes 16 all-new maps.

First announced in <a href=\"https://www.gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2020/2020/12/10/the-initiatives-perfect-dark-announced\">2020 at The Game Awards</a>, the trailer consists almost entirely of gameplay, showing off the reimagined vision of the Nintendo 64 classic.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The over 3-minute trailer shows off first-person gameplay as Joanna Dark airdrops into a lush sci-fi city. Pursuing a target, she utilizes gadgets that allow her to hack systems to open doors and eavesdrop on nearby conversations. Getting around the city involves first-person parkour as she leaps and swings across balconies. Johanna is eventually greeted by goons that she drops by blasting them with bullets, stunning them with electrical rounds, or humbling them with CQC melee takedowns. She also has a scanner that reveals enemies behind barriers.</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameBorder=\"0\"  allow=\"autoplay\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ofUi9DR9sc4\" width=\"640\"></iframe>\n\n<p>Perfect Dark is being developed by The Initiative and Crystal Dynamics.

State of Decay 3 doesn’t have a release date yet, but we do know that the game will release on Game Pass on day one.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">The earlier State of Decay games focused on survival first, rather than simply gunning down hordes of enemies that have infested the world, even if taking out zombies remained a notable part of the experience. Beginning with the second game, there was also a big focus on cooperative play for up to four players. Based on the new trailer, that second feature appears to be a particular focus, as the narrative of the video showcases individuals working together to survive the killer undead all around them.</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameBorder=\"0\"  allow=\"autoplay\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OjL3a5ZOFNo\" width=\"640\"></iframe>",

Revealed during today's Xbox Games Showcase, todays' trailer highlights some of the strange 1990s conspiracy happening within the United States in Treyarch's long-running Black Ops series alongside some quick looks at the gameplay.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>After the trailer, Microsoft Gaming CEO reiterated that <a href=\"https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/05/28/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-will-launch-day-one-on-game-pass#:~:text=Call%20of%20Duty%3A%20Black%20Ops%206%20will%20launch%20on%20Game,today%2C%20can%20be%20seen%20below.\">Black Ops 6 will launch on Xbox and PC Game Pass on day one later this year</a>, although no release date was revealed. The game will also come to PlayStation as well. Spencer said this Black Ops 6 trailer is the first time a Call of Duty game has appeared in an Xbox showcase in 10 years, and that going forward, all players (across all platforms) will experience the game, betas, seasonal expansions and updates, and more at the same time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Check out the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 gameplay reveal trailer for yourself below</strong>:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameBorder=\"0\"  allow=\"autoplay\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oyZY_BiTmd8\" width=\"640\"></iframe>\n\n<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is due out later this year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p><em>Whad to you think of this gameplay reveal?

Instead of a culinary puzzle battle, you’re hopping into anime-inspired mech suits to take on other mech suits in card-based combat.</p>\n\n<p>Revealed during the Future Game Show, players lead a crew of mech pilots, who take the form of cards, to engage in 5v5 battles against enemies. Not only can you improve their mech suits, of which 30 types exist, but you can grow meaningful relationships with your plucky pilot squad.</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameBorder=\"0\"  allow=\"autoplay\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/smvxkjXiZzM\" width=\"640\"></iframe>\n\n<p>The game includes over 50 voiced characters to bond with over 50 story missions, and players can steer the narrative by making decisions such as choosing to side with one of five factions. Gameplay is all about building the most strategically viable hand based on your personal playstyle to wipe out what Trinket Studios describes as a \"star-consuming threat.\"&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Battle Suit Aces is slated to launch for PC via Steam at an unknown date.

We also learned that players can get their hands on it before its August launch.</p>\n\n<p>Dustborn stars Pax, an ex-criminal with the unusual ability to weaponize words. As in, words are literally power for her as she can fight with shouts or manipulate people in conversations. While Pax can crack skulls using a bat and create new shouts to battle enemies, the game also focuses on building relationships with her crew of misfits (who have their own special powers). Set in an alternate Neo-western version of the U.S., you’ll travel across the country to transport an important package under the disguise of a traveling punk band. Check out its new trailer below.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameBorder=\"0\"  allow=\"autoplay\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8ogIq4hscX0\" width=\"640\"></iframe>\n\n<p>If Dustborn piques your interest, you can play a 30-minute demo next week during Steam Next Fest from June 10-17.

Yet this is easier said than done, as Killer Bean will face armies of enemies, and mysterious Shadow Beans who are better trained and more powerful than him.\"</p>\n\n<p>The humourous gameplay trailer shows the game's ever-changing open world, which morphs each time you begin a new single-player campaign. As rogue assassin Killer Bean, you can blast apart enemies (in both 1st and 3rd person), which range from soldiers to giant, Metal Gear-esque walking mechs, suplex them with wrestling moves, blow them up with rockets or just plow them with your sports car. The world is your oyster, and the game seems to be a physics showcase, with copious amounts of ragdolling characters and objects.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Killer Bean is slated to launch into Steam Early Access this summer.&nbsp;</p>",

What set this apart from similar lawsuits was a two-line warning in the complaint's introduction. Elsewhere, the statement could've been dismissed as typical anti-piracy posturing, but here, Bungie's relentless deanonymization of targets sends a powerful, credible message.\nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",
