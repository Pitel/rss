          "description": "Marvel Rivals, the free-to-play hero shooter from NetEase, launched late last week and is exceedingly popular. It's currently fourth on the Steam daily most played, right between Path Of Exile 2 and the evergreen Grand Theft Auto 5. I think there are three reasons for this enthusiasm: 1) it's free-to-play with the usual comet's tail of microtransactables 2) it's third-person Overwatch with Marvel characters, a straightforwardly enticing licensing sandwich, and 3) people want to have sex with a larger-than-usual proportion of the cast and especially awful tongue-monster Venom, who has a good butt in this one. No, I'm not going to share pictures. You'll have to google that filth yourself.\r\n\n\r\nBut perhaps you are a sophisticated soul who has no time for such salacious nonsense. You're more interested in hearing how they're patching the thing. Enough with the butts already, dang it - this is a new multiplayer game so there must, of course, be patches! Fair enough: here's what NetEase are changing or fixing in the first major update, out now.\r\n \nRead more",

It's like offering somebody a cake that is actually a cunningly painted hunk of torpedo fuselage. It's like offering to shake hands while wearing one of those comedy hand buzzers - except that the hand buzzer is an intricate simulation of zero-G physics, missile behaviours and comms jamming, featuring spacecraft with proper internal layouts that require you to think hard about attitude control if you don't want, say, your engines to become Swiss cheese about 90 seconds before you need to retreat from combat. \r\n\n\r\nBeing a \"true\" 3D real-time space strategy game, Nebulous looks and sounds a lot like Homeworld on the surface, but it's nothing like as straightforward. It is systems within systems. It is a game in which you can, theoretically, plot the path of a single guided munition through an asteroid field, so as to catch an enemy cruiser in the back. I barely understand how to make a ship fire on another ship, using plain old armour-piercing shells, and now they're threatening to add carriers, fighters and bombers. Customisable ones!

It is a dusty brown, a damp brown, a hot and earthy brown that hums with the stinging malodour of disturbed ancient moss where once old forests stood. Descending into Gatwick’s cloying brown from 33,000 feet is like flying under and up Gandalf’s wretched cloak and landing in one of the several horrible little magic pouches he keeps by his balls.\nMicrosoft Flight Simulator 2024 captures Gatwick’s brown perfectly. Next to the stupefying natural beauty of Yosemite, the imposing imperial skyscrapers of the Manhattan skyline and the surging majesty of the Alpine peaks, this local rot-tinged patch of West Sussex is the most impressively realistic depiction of a place I have seen in a game.\nRead more",

It's basic physics.

Yet he also engages in the pseudo-intellectual trash talk of the main archaeological rivals to Jones, like Rene Belloq or Walter Donovan. He is a hideous grab bag of all the things that make an instantly detestable villain in the series. But there's something else.

That’s definitely a horror thing, that” I was forced to admit. \"If my heart was on a giant obelisk, I’d be proper shaken up, I reckon.\"\nSo starts Eclipsium’s very first bit of aggressive disorientation, and it basically just escalates from there. I obviously can’t describe the vibes without slightly spoiling the vibes, so do pop over to Steam for a demo if you’re curious and, oh, there’s a potted plant, the sound of its rustling mixed in such a way that it sort of sounds like it’s shrieking at me. Well.\nRead more",

          "description": "“Hang on a sec. Haven’t I seen this exact genre of little guy before?” was my reaction upon encountering the yellow-eyed, hat-shrouded mage of isometric adventure Oolo. Some quick internet sleuthing turned up this lovely bit of art featuring Final Fantasy 9’s Vivi, Journey’s Traveller, and He-Man’s Orko. It’s a great feeling to begin your week identifying an archetype of diminutive magician, and I hope it becomes a regular occurrence. Another pleasant  discovery was Oolo itself, which you can discover yourself through the shrouded magic of this link to it’s free demo.\n(Do I need to keep writing ‘free demo’, by the way? I tend to alternate. It’s obviously redundant but I feel writing ‘free’ gives it a certain gravitas. Free tax rebate. Free sunrise. Free oxygen. It makes things sound better.)\nRead more",

Both (the best Final Fantasy game) Final Fantasy 8’s Squall and The Witcher 3’s Geralt simply cannot get enough of leaving their friends and the entire world in mortal peril while they sneak in a quick round of cards, and I love them for it. Way back when the Wild Hunt released, there was a special edition kicking about that gave you a few decks for Gwent - the fleshed-out, playable card distraction that ended up being responsible for some of the game’s best moments. I pined for those decks, but I never acquired them. Now, Hatchette Board Games is putting out a full physical edition of Gwent next year.\nThe set contains \"over 400 cards and a playmat\" for £44/$39.99. I’m still recovering from various Fantasy Flight LCGs, so my value sense for this stuff might be a bit skewed, but that strikes me as incredibly reasonable. A good Gwent deck consists of only about 25 cards. They’re not bad cards, either! I’ve got a real pet hate for tabletop versions of videogames that just use in-engine screenshots for the cards, but these ones look to have the proper artwork from the game on them:\nRead more",

Still, it’s not often we see psychological horror combined with ultraviolence, and anything that gives off even a whiff of Condemned: Criminal Origins has my attention.\nTotal Chaos started life as a popular Doom 2 mod, and while I dare the say the limitations of that game sell the atmosphere a little better than this much sleeker update, I certainly trust Trigger Happy enough to make the most of the new engine. The game is set in New Oasis, a “once bustling haven for coal miners” that is now most definitely not bustling, nor haven-like.\nRead more",

History actually remembers Computer Artworks’s 2002 shooty horror game for how incredibly ambitious and conceptually inventive its proto-sus social squad system was. In homage to the body-snatching alien paranoia of Carpenter’s 1982 horror classic, The Thing tasks you with not just assembling and directing a squad, but keeping them from breaking down or turning on you - in fear you might be hosting the titular molecular stowaway.\nRead more",

It's playfully dull, heartily mundane entertainment. No supernatural flourishes here - just the magic of paperwork and the thrill of bureaucracy.\r\n\n\r\nI'm reminded of Sakura Quest by Danchi Days, a forthcoming cosy adventure with irresponsibly enticing Game Boy Advance-style visuals. It casts you as Hoshino, a teenage girl who's just moved to an old \"danchi\" housing complex and is trying to revive the yearly tradition of a summer festival. How will she do this?

They’ve heard player feedback on the missing weapon oomph caused by the lack of hitstop in the Monster Hunter Wilds beta, and they’re bringing back the bonk.\nHere’s a handy breakdown of the issue by X user Blue Stigma, but briefly: hitstop is the brief pause in an attack animation the moment the weapon connects with an enemy, giving you a real sense of bonkitude and making say, a hammer feel different from a dagger. As the video showed, the hitstop was greatly reduced in Wilds compared to previous Monster Hunters, and many players reported the combat just feeling a bit off as a result.\nRead more",

And as that realisation sunk in for the first time, my heart also sank with it. I really tried, I mean really tried to get into Nikki's gacha offerings; to delight in its menagerie of menus and cash in countless currencies for fun socks or glitzy tiaras. Sadly, I won't be logging back in ever again.\nRead more",

          "description": "When I downloaded Creeper World IXE's demo, I had it pegged as a bizarre original. It is, in fact, the latest in a series of real-time strategy games in which you position turrets and terraform maps to repel surging, simulated tides of purple liquid. This is a war between flesh and mineral, solidity and fluidity that dates back to the age of Gillen. Alex Wiltshire (RPS in peace) interviewed creator Virgil Wall back in 2019 - amongst other things, we learn that the original Creeper World was based on a \"failure\" - and Sin has an  enthusiastic piece from 2021 about Creeper World 4, the first 3D instalment.\nWhat does Creeper World IXE bring to the party? Well, 1) it ain't 3D, and 2) it's billed as an exercise in \"dominating\" the titular Creeper, rather than keeping it at bay. For too long has this sloshing, coruscating hooligan been allowed to wash over and corrode our precious starports. We will take the fight to it in the shape of an upgradeable 2D starfleet, equipped with lasers we can use to chisel away the geography and re-rout the flow of villainous Vimto. \n Read more",

It gets played regardless because a lot of people don't know it's a solved game - specifically, young children you may wish to humiliate using your superior grown-up brain, because when you were a child somebody did the same to you. \nHow many twisted adults were born from the experience of being bullied via the medium of tic-tac-toe?

Again, you play as a bald man (called Jeff) who sits in a 4x4 bathtub and must ascend a series of difficult roads. There's a demo out now and let me tell you, it's awfully good.\nRead more",

If you don’t own them already, they’re also currently on discount as a bundle.\n\"We’re deeply saddened to share the news that Warcraft: Orcs and Humans and Warcraft II will leave our store on December 13th, 2024,” wrote GOG on X. \"Seeing these masterpieces leave our store is tough, but it also serves as another reminder of why our mission at GOG is so important.

Yuck. If there’s one type of design that deserves the accolade, though, it’s RPGs that are assured enough in the richness of their worlds to not feel the need to signpost every discovery.\nIt’s a feedback loop of charitable feelings: the game is saying \"we think you’re smart enough to find this stuff on your own\". \"You’re right!\" you respond. \"I am smart! And anyone who recognises that must be one smart cookie\". Joy abounds, it rains Tunnock’s Caramel Wafers, hedgehogs jig gracefully in the street, and all is right with the world.

Some NPCs wouldn’t be swayed by this, but some would lower their weapons at the offer of a prawn cocktail treat, and so you’d be constantly playing chicken with various guards: edging closer toward them, your shaking hands rattling the delicious disks inside the oily packet, mentally weighing up whether it's worth risking them turning hostile at the last second.\nObviously, I’d scan some real crisp packets and just alter the logos for maximum immersion.

Before that, we must heap the Maw high with any remaining new video games or video game news from 2024. Find below a few new PC releases for the pile.

This is easier to shrug off while it's still in early access, but I will confess some relief when I read that the Trese Brothers (It's pronounced \"Trese\") nudged their estimated release date back to 2025. It needs a bit longer. But I'm about ready to start recommending it.\nI'm a tad biased by my love for their previous Star Traders Colon Frontiers, an interest in mercenary management, and a wish for more turn-based tactics games that aren't bloody XCOM again. That I have reservations about what CKF hasn't yet nailed down is in part a symptom of high expectations. And because despite carrying over some design ethos from Frontiers, Cyber Knights is a very different kind of game.\nRead more",

Dark Sector's gimmick was the glaive, a pointy boomerang you could use to scoop up objects, solve puzzles, and kill stuff in third-person view.\nRead more",

But even if hadn’t been ecommerced to death, there’d still be a way to get the upgraded ray tracing and DLSS 3 frame gen tools of the RTX 40 series for less cash still: plucky 1080p contender, the RTX 4060, whose deals are still very much available and kicking.\nIn the UK, the best available prices are for the MSI GeForce RTX Ventus 2X Black edition, which is the partner card I happen to own myself – and has become the effective go-to GPU for RPS game performance tests. Over in the US, meanwhile, the Gigabyte GeForce RTX 4060 Gaming OC is the most affordable of all; it’s a chunkier design than that of the compact Ventus 2X, though that’s mainly just the tradeoff for having an extra fan. These cards were already on the cheaper end of the RTX 4060 spectrum, and now they’re £30 / $35 off in the sales. Bargain.\nRead more",

          "description": "It feels like it wasn’t so long ago that I was playing Duck Detective: The Secret Salami, but already we’re hearing of a new game from Happy Broccoli Games, Duck Detective: The Ghost of Glamping. It’s coming in 2025.\n\n\nOh, right. I just remembered what “glamping” is: glamorous camping. The opposite of roughing it. This time around, things get a little supernatural, as the detective investigates a haunting at the campgrounds. The trailer also makes a big deal about his bread addiction and related divorce. Poor guy. How else is he supposed to make sandwiches?\n\n\n\n\nAs the name implies, you play as a duck P.I. named Eugene McQuacklin, who investigates things. You gather clues, then put them together to make a clear picture of what went down and make some “deducktions.” Last time, it was an office theft that blew up into a bigger case, which is relatively mundane compared to hauntings. I’m wondering if it’s going to be one of those rubber mask Scooby Doo situations.\n\n\nTo be honest, I didn’t dig The Secret Salami all that much. It was fine. Mostly, I felt that the worldbuilding, characters, and dialogue could have been better, which is all things that can be improved in a sequel. It’s not surprising to see one so soon since it’s likely that Happy Broccoli Games have all their tools together and learned lessons from the last project. I’m just hoping that The Ghost of Glamping has a bit more meat on its bones.\n\n\nDuck Detective: The Ghost of Glamping will release on PC sometime in 2025.\n\nThe post Duck Detective will be back on the case with The Ghost of Glamping appeared first on Destructoid.",

Team Rating: 84\n\n\n\nEA FC 25 Lucas Beraldo Ultimate Succession SBC solutions\n\n\nHere's a set of solution you can use to complete the latest Ultimate Succession challenge in Ultimate Team. \n\n\nTask 1 - Top Form\n\n\n\nAny 10 82-rated items\n\n\nAny 81-rated TOTW item\n\n\n\nTask 2 - 84-Rated Squad\n\n\n\nBenzema 86\n\n\nLukaku 82\n\n\nSmalling 82\n\n\nJonsdottir 82\n\n\nZubimendi 81\n\n\nSellner 82\n\n\nHagering 82\n\n\nLohmann 82\n\n\nde Ligt 84\n\n\nReiten 88\n\n\nAke 84\n\n\n\nThe Beraldo SBC is well-worth the completion price. The card isn't 'crazy broken' by any stretch of imagination, but he's extremely affordable. He can play in a couple of positions, and also offers the Fullback+ role, but it's better to play him as a LB. \n\n\nHe also offers the Anticipate, Jockey, Whipped Cross, and Pinged Pass playstyles, which makes him a really well-rounded choice. We are getting evolutions that often include 86-rated items, so there's a great scope to upgrade this card in the near future. If you can complete the challenge for free, you should look to get this card.\n\nThe post EA FC 25: How to complete Lucas Beraldo Ultimate Succession SBC appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's still a fair amount for one person.\n\n\nThe point is that I've found another one. This one hits closer to home, as it pertains to a dystopian version of my home country, England.

          "description": "After 12 years of waiting, fans must have been quite delighted to see Path of Exile 2 finally drop on PC and console the other day. According to the game's Steam page, Grinding Gears' follow-up to its popular action RPG is going down a storm so far. In fact, it's hitting some pretty big numbers, according to recent data.\n\n\nAs always, we turn our attention to SteamDB – the third-party website that tracks all things related to Valve's gaming platform. Despite the fact that Path of Exile 2 has only been out a few days, it's already racked up 578,569 players on PC, with over 498,000 getting involved in the past 24 hours.\n\n\n\n\nThis is even more impressive when you realize the game's out in early access. Of course, it's been on more than a few people's radars, so it stands to reason that hype may be part of the reason we're seeing such impressive figures so soon after the early access launch. To say nothing of the number of console players who must have logged in.\n\n\nThe path continues\n\n\nAt the time of writing, Path of Exile 2 is at the number two spot on Steam's Top Sellers chart, though this is pretty typical for new releases. However, I'm pretty sure I saw it at number one yesterday, having temporarily knocked the Steam Deck from its pedestal. But it seems normal service has resumed.\n\n\nWork is obviously still ongoing, and the developer recently said in a post on X that a hotfix is on the way. This small update will make it so \"Raging Spirits can only summon 5 Raging Spirits per cast at all levels.\" The team also says it will be \"making adjustments to other Trigger Meta-Gems,\" so keep an eye out for that.\n\n\nAnother post on X says Grinding Gears has been keeping an eye on feedback, and has been pleased with how the launch over the weekend went. Keep doing what you're doing, I guess, if you're currently playing and enjoying Path of Exile 2.\n\nThe post Path of Exile 2 has already attracted over half a million players appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "One of the biggest power spikes you can have in Path of Exile 2 occurs when you properly equip your skills with potent Support Gems. At the start, you're limited to only two per skill, but it is possible to get more as you play through the game.\n\n\nSo here's how to get more Support Gem Sockets in Path of Exile 2. \n\n\nHow to earn Support Gem Sockets in Path of Exile 2\n\n\nSupport Gems are special gems that can only be slotted into one of your equipped skills. They allow you to customize your skills, allowing for crazy and wacky setups that are actually quite potent when tested. You'll want to kit out your favorite skills that define your build, but access to only two slots makes that difficult. \n\n\nTo get Support Gem Sockets, all you need to do is get lucky. Not kidding. A special currency called a Jeweler Orb can drop from any enemy you encounter. When used on a skill, it permanently unlocks an additional support socket for that skill only. You cannot undo this action, so think carefully before using one. Jeweler Orbs are not exactly common.\n\n\nDepending on where you are in your socket progression, you will need to use either a Lesser Jeweler Orb or a Greater Jeweler Orb. Lesser orbs are for skills stuck at two slots, while Greaters are beyond that point. You'll start seeing Jeweler Orbs drop minimally starting in Act 3, and increasing in commonality as you progress (they are never 'common', however).\n\nThe post How to get more Support Gem Sockets in Path of Exile 2 appeared first on Destructoid.",

K písničkám z alba vyšly animované videoklipy, které produkoval Leidži Macumoto, což byl kultovní japonský výtvarník (zemřel loni), který měl na svém kontě mnoho animovaných seriálů, především ze 70. - 80. let (nejslavnější z nich byl asi \"Space Battleship Yamato\"). Daft Punk ho oslovili proto, že na jeho seriálech vyrůstali, takže výsledné dílo, včetně \"jednodušší\" retro animace a naivní zápletky zcela záměrně připomíná staré japonské televizní počiny (n…",
