Available on the Wii, 3DS, and Wii U, the Virtual Console was effectively a line of purchasable retro games available via the Wii Shop Channel and eShop.\nUnlike Nintendo Switch Online, which offers up a range of playable games for an annual or monthly cost, Virtual Console allowed you pay for games ad-hoc, enabling you to download whichever title you wanted and keep it indefinitely. While we certainly love what Nintendo has been doing with Switch Online over the years, it's no secret that lots of fans would rather the firm revert back to the Virtual Console model.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

While the middle of the three doesn't appear to be all that relevant to the Palworld case (it was filed in 2022 and is all about exchanging items with other players), the remaining two were filed after Palworld's launch and specifically detail creature-catching mechanics — the specifics of which appear to be integral to the lawsuit in Japan.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "There's something uncanny about dipping \"classic\" games in a tub of HD paint for the purposes of a remaster. A reboot can completely reinvent an old character, intriguing players in the same way an adaptation of Macbeth might excite a theatre dweeb. But remasters often feel like someone has plainly yet painstakingly rolled over every inch of the original with linoleum. The worst remasters bring to mind the Spanish pensioner who butchered a fresco of Jesus Christ. As acts of restoration go, Aspyr's work on Tomb Raider (and Soul Reaver) isn't quite that egregious. Hard work has gone into updating the scenery and textures. Basic vine sprites become handsome twirls of plantlife. Egyptian reliefs are given form. But there's a limit to this unfurling of digital lino. The results ultimately evoke the look common in mobile games when smartphones were becoming ever more powerful. This is Lara Croft if she were designed by Gameloft in 2011.\nRead more",

Hence, to some degree, Sid Meier's Civilization VII's new Age system, which is designed to counter feelings of exhaustion by smashing the chronology up into more digestible chunks, with something of a Civ power level reset between Ages to stop you feeling like you're either hopelessly behind or so far ahead that ultimate victory is guaranteed.\n Read more",

We've all played it, and we all have mildly different opinions on it - the stuff that thrilling conversations are made of. Onward!\nNic: James did you work out how to freeze things yet?\nJames: I’ll explain this quickly so Nic can get on to complaining about Avowed having the wrong kinds of boxes. But yes, I did get stuck on an early main quest that required me to use ice magic to create frozen platforms for crossing water, an otherwise neat little systems thingy that had not been communicated or hinted at before that point, but was communicated and hinted at during the following main quest.\nOtherwise, I’m having an okayish time? It doesn’t have the Skyrim-tier expansiveness I always hope for with these kinds of games, but its world is a pretty one, and it’s got some quality close-quarters mageing.\nNic: Look. I feel passionately about those crates. There are two types of crates. You can only smash the crates that have the special 'smash me' icon on them. I don't want a crate to \"come hither\" me. Takes all the fun out of the petty vandalism.\nIt's funny though because those two qualities you mention, James - the world and magic - are the same ones I thought were Avowed's strongest elements.

I'd run through all the ways Obsidian's latest didn't quite do it for me, most of you would go play it anyway because it's on Games Pass, and we'd all go back to patiently waiting for the sun to explode.\nBut, god, what a devastatingly gorgeous open-zoned world this is. What a triumphantly weird, sprawling playground of fantasy naturalia. What a treat it is to just climb all over, its design ethos captured in the first magical ring I found offering a 15% buff to parkour speed.\nIgnore two thirds of the weapons and just roll a wizard to witness the stodgy melee combat of other classes give way to crackling, cackling spell-slinging. There is such a gulf of quality here it's like playing two different games. I spent 27 hours having a meh ol' time until a reinstallation of Nvidia's loathsome app deleted 200 some screenshots and I had to restart. Why not play a wizard? I thought. Why not indeed.

Kotick made the comments during an appearance on Grit, a business podcast by American venture capital company Kleiner Perkins. He appeared on the podcast with former EA CEO Bing Gordon (thanks, Gamespot), to talk about both their company histories.\nKotick's statements reference widely reported incidents alleging a company culture of harassment, intimidation, and pay inequity around the time - coinciding with a lawsuit against the company - and the petition referred to appears to be this one to remove him as CEO, which attracted over a thousand signatures.\nThat petition followed a report by the Wall Street Journal (paywalled) that highlighted several alleged incidents of harassment by Activision staff, alongside reports that Kotick was aware of these allegations but did not inform the company's board of directors, and intervened to prevent the firing of an alleged harasser. It wasn't just Activision workers who found these claims alarming: a group of company shareholders called for Kotick's resignation soon after. Kotick denied any wrongdoing.\nRead more",

          "description": "Hi-Rez Studios have laid off an unknown number of the studio's employees, only one month after launching MOBA sequel Smite 2 as a free-to-play beta. It looks like management has cut at least 20-30 jobs and the full number is likely higher. As a result, three other games that have been long-running staples of the studio will no longer get any updates. Smite, Paladins, and Rogue Company will have nobody to man the code cannons, so they're being left to gather cobwebs from now on. Although they will remain playable. \nRead more",

It is a hypnotically involving game of picking up hitchhikers and battling tailgaters, a pixel art drivealong with tactile, chunky buttons and perfectly suited sound effects, as much fuelled by nostalgia as it is by gasoline. At first, I thought it was too loose and open-ended to elicit any deep feelings. But then I had to sell my guitar for half a tank of petrol, just to visit my dying grandmother.

There’s also a standalone benchmark tool that you can download from the game’s Steam page, so you can see for yourself how the beast-biffing RPG will run on your hardware.\nIn theory, these are great developments. Lower requirements mean a more widely accessible game, and the benchmark tool – which covers a good six minutes of combined cinematics and simulated free roaming – brings reassurance and accountability to this otherwise hype-reliant prerelease period. Sadly, there are two problems. One, the benchmark confirms outright that Monster Hunter Wilds will run like stagnant goulash on low-end PCs, and two, it does so to the extent that I’m not sure that the revised minimum specs are even reliable.\nRead more",

Some years ago, the Enclave, a city state acting as the isolationist heart of the world’s magic, exploded in a kind of power surge - one part tsunami, one part blown fuse - and just as quickly sealed itself off from the world outside.

It's an engrossing RPG, despite developer co-founder Dan Vávra's tendency to throw his weight behind alt-right harassment campaigns. Also, a relatively bug-free one. \r\n\n\r\nIn the course of my 51 hours as reviewer, I've encountered only a smattering of more significant technical issues. Firstly, some heavy slowdown while roaming Trosky Castle, the centerpiece of the opening Bohemian Paradise region, which I resolved by quitting and reloading. Secondly, a mildly terrifying moment in a dugout when a wounded soldier I was supposed to be treating struck a T-pose, as though afflicted by lightning early onset arthritis. And thirdly a repeated crash bug which I feel warrants its own article given that, together with Deliverance 2's eccentric saving system, it cost me several hours of progress.\r\n \nRead more",

The crash, which grounded the plane by damaging its left wing, occurred after Akemann ignored temporary drone restrictions in order to survey the Palisades fires before losing control. Thanks, Eurogamer. For first noticing the case, I mean. I'm not blaming Eurogamer for the drone crash. Not this one, anyway.\nThe drone was traced back to Akemann, who has agreed to plead guilty to one count of unsafe operation of an unmanned aircraft. That's a misdemeanour that usually carries up to one year prison time, but he's \"hoping to escape the prison term in exchange for 150 hours of community service in support of wildfire relief and the approximately $65,000 USD it cost to repair the plane,\" write Eurogamer, as part of a plea agreement.\nRead more",

But the calm times are coming to an end. The big releases now march towards us in droves. But they do not know what lies waiting for them in the moat. The slick scales of the Maw surface in the moonlight, groaning, waiting, sick with hunger for fresh releases. The battle is yet to start, but we will upturn the chumbucket of news into the water below. Feed it, for heavens sake. FEED THE MAW!\nRead more",

It’s a mostly AI-powered technology at a time when mistrust in artificial intelligence, fuelled by underbaked applications and anti-creative policies, is at all-time high – not to mention how the new GeForce GPUs it’s released alongside, the RTX 5080 and RTX 5090, have immediately entered 2020-style stock shortage purgatory.\nHowever, having tried it out in a few different games, I suspect time will prove kinder to DLSS 4 than the RTX 50 series launch has been. It is, in fact, a rather nifty collection of upscaling improvements that can help out older graphics cards as readily as the very newest, while building on DLSS 3’s frame generation tool with Multi Frame Generation (MFG) to send visual smoothness skyrocketing. If you care even the slightest iota for how your PC performs in modern games, DLSS 4 demands your attention.\nHere, then, I’ll break down DLSS 4’s various tricks and components, looking at how they really affect performance – and whether it’s worth upgrading your rig to maximise compatibility with it.\nRead more",

          "description": "Hidden away on NASA's Golden Record, an interstellar archive of music, image and sound, there is a recording of a poem by Charles Baudelaire, Élévation, which describes the astral ascent of the soul. Well, part of a poem. Both to free up room on the disc and perhaps, to edit out \"the vast sorrows and all the vexations\" of the second half, only the first two stanzas appear. The recording in fact ends halfway through a line, which conjures up an intriguing problem for the listener, inasmuch as the thwarted rhyme scheme reveals that the piece is incomplete. A poetically-minded alien might be tempted to fill in the gap. A fancier alien who took a module in postmodernism might hail the poetics of the fragment. A resolutely practical alien who thinks poetry is for losers might read the whole thing, instead, as a set of incoherent navigational prompts, made up of loose prepositions - au-dessus, au-dessus, par delà, par delà.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "When you first explore the region of Shatterscarp, you'll come across a roadblock with its broken lift. The NPCs will ask you to mend it, but the game doesn't necessarily tell you how. So, if you're wondering what to do, here's how to fix the Shatterscarp lift in Avowed.\n\n\nHow do you fix the lift at Shatterscarp in Avowed?\n\n\nYou'll likely encounter the broken lift while on the quest for the Fires in the Mine mission or when simply traveling around the Shatterscarp map. Interacting with the lever won't do you much good, so you'll need to go the long way around and fix it from the other side. Head towards Deadfall Highlands and then make your way to the Sulfur Mines Basecamp.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nAs you may expect, there will be a few enemies along this pathway, so come prepared with weapons and healing items. Once you cross the bridge to the camp, you must use electricity magic to power the generator on the lift's right side. You can shock the Essence Generator yourself with a grimoire or utilize Giatta's Spectral Jolt.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThe lift should now work after you power the generator, allowing you to interact with the lever. Head down to get a nice little dialogue scene from the NPCs below it. I was hoping it would unlock a quest or reward with them, but nothing seems to be tied to them after this. I checked back on these characters, and they just continue to stick around there. However, this time, they're thankful for what you did.\n\n\nAn event could trigger later on, as the townsfolk mention they need to return to work soon. At the most, you can finish out the Fires in the Mines quest, which you can begin on your way to Thirdborn. The Shatterscarp lift will always work from now on, making travel much more accessible in Avowed. \n\nThe post How to fix the Shatterscarp lift in Avowed appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Avowed pays a lot of importance to a character's leveling-up system, and you should pay proper attention from the very beginning of your journey.\n\n\nAs you level up, you'll inherit different skills and boost your in-game stats. You'll be able to dedicate a level-up point to one of your major attributes (as long as you don't break the cap), along with secondary stats. This will make it easier to complete certain tasks and unlock new abilities after hitting important milestones.\n\n\nWhen you complete any task in the game, you'll gain experience points and level up (standard Obsidian system). The main aim is to streamline the process to boost the speed you level up.\n\n\nBest ways to level up in Avowed\n\n\nCompleting the main quests makes a lot of sense as that will allow you to progress through the main story and move closer to reaching the ending point. However, you should also invest an equal amount of time in side quests. You'll find plenty of them when you access new regions.\n\n\nCompleting the side quests has two major benefits. You'll gain a lot of useful in-game resources, which include new equipment and money, and your character will gain a lot of XP, allowing you to level up faster.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nSimilarly, Bounty Missions can be a great source for leveling up your character. You'll find boards set up in different regions, and going through them will allow you to accept the quests. Compared to side quests, Bounty Missions are a lot harder to complete. They're also far fewer in numbers and can't be farmed repeatedly.\n\n\nThat said, completing a Bounty Mission is extremely rewarding, as you get plenty of XP to level up, along with new resources. If you want to learn more about earning money in Avowed, check out our guide.\n\n\nUltimately, there's no rocket science or glitch to improve your levels in the game. Make sure to complete as many quests as possible, and don't get fixated on the main storyline.\n\nThe post Avowed: How to level up fast appeared first on Destructoid.",

World of Warcraft Classic has been a tremendous success for Blizzard, and I’ve personally seen people who swore off the Blizz product years ago be pulled back into the Classic charm.\n\n\nOne of the uniting factors for these games was that it wasn’t enough to just relaunch old products, they truly came to life and found purpose when the develope…",

Píšu několikrát \"pravděpodobně\", protože musím přiznat, že se v aktuálním Marvel vesmíru neorientuji tolik, jako jsem se v minulých desetiletích orientoval ve filmových X-Men a Hulkovi (protože jsem je překládal).\n(Tato recenze je bez spoilerů, pokud za spoilery nepokládáte to, co je vidět na plakátech a v trailerech.)\nTakže: Drama je rozehráno atentátem na nového…",

Mělo to mít nějakou jinou \"message\" než \"když jsi psychopatický gangster, špatně dopadneš\"? Ale docela to uteklo. Jednoznačné mínus a nechtěný (zřejmě?) humor tkví ve skutečnosti, že hlavní hrdinka (t.j. žena) pořád vypadá jako nabušený chlap v paruce a během celého filmu to žádné jiné postavě nepřijde divné.
