Mario as a solo sibling has been around for even longer than his own series, first appearing — of course — as Jumpman in 1981's Donkey Kong.\nDespite having his name in the title, the Mario franchise isn't about the Italian plumber alone. He was joined by his faithful brother Luigi in the first Mario Bros. arcade game in 1983, who also has a successful franchise of his own with the Luigi’s Mansion series. As well as that double trouble duo, you've got Princess Peach, Toad, Yoshi, and a bunch of antagonists to bop on the head as you run and jump your way through the Mushroom Kingdom. This cast of characters can also get quite competitive, whether playing Tennis or Golf or screaming around the track in a Mario Kart.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "It means \"village romanticization\".\nIn an age where it feels like many big-budget projects are falling victim to 'FOMO mechanics' and stricter price schemes, it can be refreshing to play a game that focuses on simplicity, like Dorfromantik. Here you have a puzzle game that doesn't chase after complex mechanics, cutting-edge design, or intense action; Dorfromantik is simply about building warm, rural countrysides at your own pace. No pressure. No noise. And though it sacrifices some of its long-term appeal with this approach, we commend Dorfromantik for committing wholly to the peaceful atmosphere it endeavors to create.\nBased around a simple score-based puzzle, you start off with a single hex tile floating in space and your goal is simply to build out a countryside as far as you possibly can by adding to it. Each hex tile in your stack has a collection of things like houses, forests, or rivers on its various edges and you get points for each edge you can match to an already placed tile.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

We’ve seen it all — and we went back to see it again in Labo VR — and now we’re looking for something else to scratch that Zelda itch. Tears of the Kingdom is coming, of course, but we need another hit.\nWe’re sure many of you can sympathise. A Zelda game is an event to savour, and the wait for the next entry can be tough. Breath of the Wild’s open world lasted us longer than most, but we’re getting anxious for another action-RPG fix.

Unfortunately, while on a deep sea dive to retrieve the tapes of episodes 13 and 14 (an expedition funded by supporters; your generosity is always appreciated), my ship was attacked by a large and unusually toothsome whale-like creature. The cursed thing took a huge bite out of the side of our noble vessel, The Squiggled Egg, and we were forced to abandon ship. It was only by the grace of the botswain Hughbert Threads that I'm alive to write this post today, as the man gave his life beating back the foul beast, giving a large part of the rest of the crew time to get away. Alas, in the confusion, I only secured episode 14, and episode 13 is now lost to time. That is definitely what happened, and not that the digital recording got mangled somehow.\nStill, episode 14 (which is now episode 13, even though I say 14 in the recording) is now here for you to enjoy. It's all about bad and obsolete palaeontology - the weird ways people in history interpreted fossils, and why.\nRead more",

At some point there'll be a two hour YouTube video outlining how it has a clear and nuanced plot, or that it's a metaphor for periods and erections, or both. In the immediate, it's about slithering out of a pod, staggering through the desert, and finding yourself in a strange, huge rotting machine made of rock and flesh that's already decades into abandonment and decay, and where most things look a bit penisy or womby. It's about the lizardy parasite latched to your back gradually transforming your body. It's about grim squishy noises and survival.\nScorn doesn't have dialogue, or a map. It doesn't really have a HUD, it doesn't have quest markers, and your character will not, upon seeing a strange new device, say something like \"Hmm... seems like a key. Maybe if I find the two missing ones, it'll open up a way forward!\" out loud. It won't even pull focus to the corridor you should check next. You just have to look around, experiment, and figure it out. I think I like it. I don't know if I can recommend it.\nRead more",

          "description": "The Ryzen 7 5800X was a great gaming CPU when it launched in 2020, and it remains one of the fastest options going despite the recent release of Ryzen 7000 processors late last month. The 5800X also has two major advantages: it works on a wide range of cheap motherboards with DDR4 RAM, and it's way cheaper than the 7700X - especially when it's discounted on Ebay US, as is the case today!\nSo: let's cut to the chase. The 5800X is down to $229.99 at Ebay, from a list price of $449, meaning it's nearly 50% off. That also makes it $170 cheaper than the equivalent Ryzen 7000 processor, the $400 eight-core Ryzen 7700X. Or, to put it another way, you're paying around 60% of the price for at least 80% of the gaming performance of that newer CPU - not bad, given that you'll also pay way less for a complete Ryzen 5000 system (with AM4 motherboards and DDR4) than a complete Ryzen 7000 one (with AM5 motherboards and DDR5). \nRead more",

          "description": "Detective games are often about filling in the blanks. A terrible crime will sit at the heart of them, yes, but most take place in the days and weeks that follow, where the bulk of your time is spent gathering clues and building a case to work out whodunnit. Rarely do you get to glimpse the immediate aftermath of the crime itself, where all the major suspects are still in play and their pockets are stuffed with incriminating evidence they'll no doubt be disposing of in the coming minutes. \nThe prime exception to this rule is Lucas Pope's Return Of The Obra Dinn, which gives you a time-travelling pocket watch to revisit the scenes of its many, many murders and work out exactly what happened to its 60-strong passenger list on its titular, ill-fated ship. Frogwares' Sherlock Holmes games and their mind palace visualisation techniques also warrant a mention here, and maybe even Outer Wilds at a push, if you count its 22-minute timeloop as an investigation scene several millennia in the making. But it's Obra Dinn that Color Gray Games emulate most strongly with their impressive debut in The Case Of The Golden Idol, which gives you a series of 12 murders to solve, each of which is presented as a freeze-frame vignette at the moment of death. You're still filling in blanks here, slotting names, objects and eventually verbs in its various scene scrolls to deduce whodunnit and howtheydunit, but this intriguing tale of 18th century high (and a secret) society, betrayals, backstabbing and murder most foul is a mystery game for the ages. \nRead more",

The way she wanted to organise keys wasn't what the game thought was the right way, and her article examined this frustration; she described the canonical correct solution as being that of a \"domestic Joker\".\nThe developers at Max Inferno Studios read this article and decided that, you know what? Alice0 was on to something. They contacted us to let us know that her piece was the inspiration for adding a feature called Let It Be, a skip puzzle function that you can access at any time. Anne Macmillan, who's a co-founder of Max Inferno Studios as well as artist and animator for A Little To The Left, was kind enough to talk to me about it.\nRead more",

Speaking of, today is the last day of the Amazon Prime Early Access Sale, which has the 1TB Blue SN570 down to £65.\nThat’s not quite its lowest price ever, but it does match its flash sale pricing during Prime Day back in July. And is an utter pittance for a 1TB NVMe SSD, let alone one that’s actually quite speedy. Amazon UK also have the 2TB version on sale for £128, just £1 more than its lowest dip on record (Prime Day 2022 again, as it happens). These prices are only available to Prime members, but the Blue SN570 ranks highly among the best SSDs for gaming, so they're well deserving of your cash if you’re in need of PC storage improvements.\nRead more",

So relevant, in fact, that I'm starting to wonder if this wasn't an attempt at psychological sabotage disguised as a friendly gesture. (You wouldn't do that to me, would you, Alice?)\nRomancelvania is exactly what it sounds like: dating sim meets Castlevania. No idea how I missed it during my own perusal of the demo list, because unsurprisingly it's immediately become my favourite thing I've ever played at a Steam Next Fest. I was so drawn in, in fact, that I've been having a tough time putting it down, even when I really need to — hence my suspicion that this was some sort of test on Alice's part. No idea if I've succeeded or failed.\nThe demo starts on a promising note, awakening you in the persona of a comically brooding and exaggeratedly shirtless hunky Dracula. (The final game will include the option to play as a Lady Drac, if you prefer, who will not be shirtless, but not by a large margin.)\n Read more",

The titular island, and your overgrown plot of farmland on it, has almost the same layout as Stardew Valley, and the tasks you do - growing stuff, keeping animals, making friends with locals, exploring a mine five levels at a time, and appeasing local spirits by giving them bundles of different crops - will also be very familiar to any DewHeads (that's what we call ourselves).\nThat's not to say Coral Island isn't good. It's all in very beautiful bouncy 3D, for one thing, and I found the island setting (which impacts the flora, fauna, and architecture in general) made everything feel less like work. Combined with a thread of environmentalism weaving through the game, and the fact that Coral Island is slightly easier than Stardew Valley, and you feel like you're doing more progress in less time. If you loved the vibe of ConcernedApe's smash hit, but found the need to hand-write your own almanac a bit intimidating, this is the game for you.\nRead more",

With the RTX 4090 and a whole family of oversized GPUs on the way, those tiny PCIe slots on your motherboard are taking on an incredible amount of weight, such that even mid-range cards can sag and bend over time. \nThe best way to prevent this is with a brace, which pushes up from the bottom of your case to the far end of the graphics card, holding it level and preventing all that force from affecting the card or the PCIe slot. You sometimes get a support brace like this free with your graphics card, but otherwise you can pick one up fairly inexpensively from a range of manufacturers. \nRead more",

          "description": "I keep forgetting Valkyrie Elysium's PC release date is later than its console one. The action platformer came out on PlayStation late last week, but it's not coming to Steam until November 11th. So far, reviews have been quite middling, which isn't wholly surprising in some sense, but having played the public demo the other week, I'm not ashamed to say that I had a pretty all right time with it! Based on two hours of play time, I'd say it's very much in the same kind of vein as your Bayonettas and Nier: Automatas, and I'm 100% down for that.\nRead more",

          "description": "It feels odd saying \"Overwatch 1\", but Overwatch 1 occupies an important place in my personal and professional life. And all things considered, I do not miss it in the slightest. I spent so much time straining against the game's tug-of-war matches that I simply grew tired of trying really hard at it - or perhaps more accurately, trying not to launch my head through the nearest plaster wall.\nClearly, there was a time where I adored Overwatch, though. A time when I'd grind solo-queue most evenings until 3am, in a bid to climb the ranks ever higher. To what end? My own personal satisfaction, I suppose. I'd eventually hit Master (let me brag just once, okay) and then a few months later, I applied for a job at Gamer Network writing guides about Overwatch's intricacies. I moved to Brighton for my first proper job. Now, with Overwatch 2's release, it all feels like it's come full circle.\nRead more",

You loot, and avoid traps, chug red liquids, and occasionally die and have to start again. But I enjoyed every moment, and never once hit the usual aggravating points that push me out of the genre.

Curious, he decided to pursue more knowledge, and landed in the Nier modding Discord server. \r\n\n\r\nLike him, many other Nier: Automata players who caught wind of the phenomenon sat upright - metaphorically and perhaps literally - and flocked to both Reddit and Discord to check out what exactly was up with the secret area.

          "description": "Straight from the horse's mouth\nSince the premature death of Silent Hills and the P.T. demo, we've seen a constant stream of supposed leaks and rumors about what will be the next Silent Hill game. Plenty of people claim to have inside information, but this Wednesday, we'll hear it directly from the people who actually run the show. Konami dropped word on Sunday that a Silent Hill Transmission will broadcast on October 19 and will feature \"the latest updates for the Silent Hill series.\"\nhttps://twitter.com/Konami/status/1581754864702398464\nIt's anybody's guess what we'll see in the show, but I'd put my money on Konami pulling back the curtain on that recently uncovered Silent Hill: The Short Message product listing. Could The Short Message be a new game or a remake of one of the previous games in the series? Is it that Abandoned game we've all stopped making fun of? I used the Silent Hill: Shattered Memories key art in the banner image because Sam Barlow mentioned a follow-up to that masterpiece in the past. And Masahiro Ito seems to be aware of it. I guess as long as Konami isn't revealing a new pachinko machine, it should be worth tuning in for.\nThe Silent Hill franchise has been in purgatory for about a decade following the release of Downpour and Book of Memories in 2012. Hideo Kojima famously tried to take the reigns of the franchise in 2014 with Silent Hills, but following a well-publicized fallout with Konami, he left the company and the project behind to form his own studio. There have been many rumors of Kojima creating a Silent Hill game over at Kojima Productions, but there's not been anything concrete on that front.\nWhatever it is, fans won't have to wait long. The Silent Hill Transmission is set for October 19 at 2:00 pm Pacific.\nThe post Konami set to reveal the latest on the Silent Hill series this Wednesday appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's been causing crashes during the pre-match loading screen, affecting both online and offline play.\nWhile Nintendo has suspended the roll-out of the update, it's also taking servers down temporarily while it investigates. Online play will not be available, obviously, and save data backup will be suspended as well.\nhttps://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1580939363797504000\nA quick pause in play\nVer. 1.2.1 for Switch Sports was released earlier this week, on October 12. Its goal was to strengthen measures against disruptive behaviors. That entails any violations of Nintendo's Community Guidelines, including fraudulent behavior, including save data manipulation.\nThe previous update, Ver. 1.2.0, added a fair bit to the Wii Sports successor. One-on-one and four-on-four soccer got leg strap support, volleyball received a new slide attack move, and some nice features were added for online play.\nIn our review of Nintendo Switch Sports, it sounds like while the single-player progression wasn't the most rewarding, it still had a good bit to offer for multiplayer gatherings. And honestly, who doesn't have fond memories of bowling?\nHopefully the online sees a fix soon. Meanwhile, Nintendo Switch Sports is still due to receive its golf update, which was pushed out of September but should arrive sometime in the holiday season.\nThe post Switch Sports servers are offline as Nintendo investigates issue in latest update appeared first on Destructoid.",

The RTX 4080 12 GB card was one of two 4080s set to launch next month, but Nvidia is halting the smaller of the two.\n\"The RTX 4080 12GB is a fantastic graphics card, but it’s not named right,\" reads a statement from Nvidia. \"Having two GPUs with the 4080 designation is confusing.\"\nSo the 12 GB card will be \"unlaunched,\" and the Nvidia RTX 4080 16 GB will still arrive on November 16.\nThe 4090, meanwhile, went live on October 12 and has been reviewing pretty alright as the powerhouse of the new line.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glz5B-4IlKE\nWhat's in a name?\nThe name is one obvious distinction, as having two somewhat similar-sounding cards might be one issue. But the 12 GB and 16 GB configurations are actually a bit more different than the names might imply.\nThe hardware folks over at Digital Foundry did a breakdown of the distinctions between the two cards, as well as the 24 GB RTX 4090.\nWhile the names imply a difference in VRAM, the 12 and 16 GB are actually fairly different cards. They have different core processors, with \"wild variations\" in the compute power and memory bandwidth. Nvidia's own benchmarks have been a bit weird too, compared to the previous 3000 generation of cards.\nSuffice to say, it sounds like there were a lot of questions and concerns around this particular model, and Nvidia is taking the option to shelve it. Focus can all go back on to the 16 GB card and the 4090 that way.\nThe post Nvidia is ‘unlaunching’ its 12 GB 4080 graphics card appeared first on Destructoid.",

Arc System Works sure hopes so, as next week will see the publisher launch an open beta to test the rollback netcode update for its excellent anime fighter Guilty Gear Xrd Rev 2 — The beta will kick off October 17 on the Steam release of the 2017 smasher.\nWhile ArcSys is currently enjoying the fruits of more recent entry Guilty Gear Strive, its predecessor is still tightly-held by many of the GG faithful as one of, if not the, finest entry in the long-running fighting game franchise. Recognizing this, the developer is taking steps to ensure that those players who still wish to party like it's 2017 are afforded the best experience available, with the same silky smooth netcode that younger brother GG Strive offers.\nTo get folks in gear (pun fully intended) for the beta, ArcSys is also holding a slew of discounts on the Guilty Gear Steam back catalog. New and veteran players can bag several titles including Guilty Gear Xrd Rev 2, Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus R, and BlazBlue Cross Tag Battle, alongside their respective DLC, for hugely discounted prices. It should be noted that none of these games feature the new and improved version of Testament, but Baiken and Bridget are in the mix, so they're well worth your dollarydoos.\nPrepare to meet Elphelt. Be very afraid.\nGuilty Gear Xrd Rev 2 is available now on PS4 and PC. The rollback netcode beta test will take place from October 17 to October 31.

Bellibolt, the EleFrog Pokemon, will be debuting in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet.\nThe new monster-pal for Paldea was teased earlier this week in a video, spotlighting the region's Electric-type Gym Leader Iono. Today, the Leader/influencer/streamer Iono returns to debut just what her partner Pokemon is.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkfN-jyEcrI\nBellibolt is, as you can tell, an Electric-type frog. As Iono notes, those giant bumps on the side of its head are not eyes.\nInstead, its actual face is that little smiley face you see in the middle, above its electricity-generating belly. A Bellibolt can expand and contract, generating electricity for shocking attacks it discharges from those bumps.\nIts ability, Electromorphosis, is a new one. When Bellibolt is hit by an attack, it charges up, boosting the power of its next Electric-type move. Seems like it could be an interesting frontline tank for your Pokemon party.\n\nA new pal in Paldea\nBellibolt is another in a string of reveals for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet. We've been gradually meeting more and more of the newcomers over the last few months. Pokemon like Wiglett, Grafaiai, and more are in store.\nPlus, we're also getting a good look at some of the people living in Paldea too. Iono is the third Gym Leader we've seen so far, and will act as one of several the player will need to topple along Victory Road.\nFrom auto-battling and TM crafting to the glorious lil' buddy called Lechonk, we're getting a pretty good idea of what's ahead for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet. The new generation of Pokemon games isn't too far off, either.\nPokemon Scarlet and Violet go live on Nintendo Switch on November 18, 2022.\nThe post Bellibolt is a new electric frog Pokemon for Scarlet and Violet appeared first on Destructoid.",

It was wildly successful at the time, especially among SRPG fans, which led to these very remakes being dug up in the modern era. Developer Storm Trident and publisher Forever Entertainment (alongside of Square Enix) are handling the remakes.\nHere's a quick brief on the second game, which takes place 12 years after the original:\n\"12 years have passed since the second Huffman conflict. The impoverished People's Republic of Alordesh has been suffering a severe economic decline ever since the war ended. In June 2102, soldiers of the Alordesh Army rise up and, led by Ven Mackarge, declare independence from the O.C.U. (Oceania Cooperative Union).\"\n\nAs a reminder, Front Mission 1st: Remake is out in November, and Front Mission 2: Remake will be arriving in 2023.

Unfortunately, we're not in a position to give a timeframe on a new release date right now, but we will update you all as soon as we can. In the meantime, anybody who has pre-purchased on digital storefronts will receive a refund where applicable in line with platform policy.\"\nOfficially launching on PC in the summer of 2021, Humankind is an evolutionary strategy simulation that is similar in fashion to the popular Civilization series, and tasks players with evolving Man as a species from rocks and fire through to the most contemporary and technologically sound eras imaginable. Of course, being human, there are plenty of pitfalls and barriers en route, including politics, famine, disease, and man's seemingly most popular pastime, war.\nWhile critics were a little down on Humankind's \"safe\" approach to the evolutionary strategy genre, the title was praised regardless for its gameplay, structure, and general thematics. Now available to purchase on PC via Steam, PlayStation and Xbox players will have to stay tuned for further news of the troubled console port.\nThe post Humankind console editions have been indefinitely delayed appeared first on Destructoid.",

We're proud of what we've accomplished so far, and this continues to be a passion project for everyone here. We are incredibly grateful — and excited — to be able to work within a universe that means so much to so many. We can't wait for you to see it all and look forward to taking you on an adventure unlike any Star Trek game that's come before.\"\nOriginally revealed at The Game Awards just last year, Star Trek: Resurgence is a narrative experience in the vein of Telltale Games' litany of choice-based adventure games. Studio Dramatic Labs is itself made up of former Telltale Games employees, and thus one can likely expect the people politics, dramatic tension, and moral decision-making of games such as The Walking Dead, The Wolf Among Us, and Batman: The Telltale Series.\nStar Trek: Resurgence will launch April 2023 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.\nThe post Star Trek: Resurgence now delayed until April 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

The price for the new bundle is yet to be disclosed. A little bafflingly, this bundle will not include the recently announced God of War DualSense controller, which will be released as a separate standalone accessory.\nThe bundle was revealed as part of a new \"Next Gen Immersion\" trailer, which spotlights God of War Ragnarok running on the powerful PS5 platform. It should be noted that Ragnarok is a multi-generational release, so PS4 players will be able to pick up the new game for their platform of choice. Given how much the 2018 original made my PS4 sound like a Boening 747 was about to land, I dread to think how much the grand-looking sequel will get the black boxes sweating.\nGod of War Ragnarok launches November 9 on PlayStation platforms.\nThe post Sony announces God of War Ragnarok PS5 hardware bundle appeared first on Destructoid.",

Wracked with jealousy and anger at his \"hanger-on\" status in the regal family, Scar surreptitiously befriends the hyenas of the Pridelands, ultimately executing a scheme that costs his brother his life, banishes Simba to the jungle, and sees Scar step in as king, leading to austerity, death, and the breaking of the ecologically vital \"Circle of Life\".\nAnd now, he's gonna be your best pal.

          "description": "Hair today, gone tomorrow\nRamping up those hyper engines beyond capacity, Nintendo has released a four-minute trailer for its long-awaited sequel Bayonetta 3, ahead of the game's October 28 launch on Nintendo Switch. The new preview features the Umbra Witch in typically fine fashion, battling alongside new and familiar allies.\nTitled \"Bayonettas Everywhere?!\" the trailer mixes fast 'n' frantic gameplay with snippets of the game's cinematics — perhaps showing a little more than is necessary, frankly. Our favorite hair-whipper is showcased battling an array of demons, monsters, and ghoulies, while tighter attention is paid to her new punk-rock protege, Viola. This young and spirited witch-in-training will accompany Bayonetta in her battle against a fearsome new enemy: the time-warping Homunculi.\nYou can check out the trailer below. Personally, I think it shows off a little too much story.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hh6bwdYgbio\nIn addition to the story and gameplay footage. The preview offers another look at the \"Demon Masquerade\" an ability that will allow the unholy one to channel various otherworldly beings — including demons Gomorrah, Malphas, and Phantasmaraneaeto — to both tweak her attack option and offer up brand-new combo routes, allowing our girl to switch up her battle abilities in the thick of the action.\nMore curiously, the trailer ends with a delightful-looking side-mode, that sees long-time Bayo pal Jeanne infiltrating a subterranean complex in delightful 2D action. The footage is reminiscent of the classic 1994 arcade release Elevator Action Returns, and is, surprisingly, one of the trailer's coolest elements. Bayonetta 3 might have teased us with the very longest of waits, but the sequel seems to be shaping up very nicely indeed. Besides, if we aren't being teased, is it even really Bayo?\nBayonetta 3 launches October 28 on Nintendo Switch.\nThe post It’s a veritable witch fest in this flashy new Bayonetta 3 trailer appeared first on Destructoid.",

Following the video, a wistful Asano commented: \"Looking at the [HD] opening movie of Bravely Default, I feel like announcing a remaster of Bravely Default would be the best possible thing.

          "description": "Even more Spidey action is on the way for PC players\nAnother Marvel's Spider-Man has locked in a date for a PC port. Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales hits PC on November 18.\nThe PC version of Miles Morales will have PC features and settings, similar to the Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered port that hit PC earlier this year.\nThese include some fancy graphics options, like ray-traced reflections and new ray-traced shadows. NVIDIA DLSS 3 is also being supported, as are other options like DLSS 2, DLAA, and NVIDIA Reflex. And hardware-wise, Miles Morales will support ultra-wide gaming with ratios of 21:9, 32:9, or even 48:9 through triple-monitor setups.\nThat's on the extreme end of things though. According to today's PlayStation Blog, Insomniac is also supporting other configurations aside from high-end PCs; namely, portable PC gaming devices. DualSense haptics will also be supported, if you wire one in over a USB connection.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMRBuagwRb4\nA shocking spin of the web\nIf you don't own Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered, then no worries. This is a standalone entry. It's going for $49.99 on Steam and Epic, and pre-orders will net a few in-game goodies a little earlier than you'd normally achieve them.\nMiles' Spidey adventure is one I never got around to finishing on PlayStation 5, so the prospect of revisiting it is pretty appealing. It's received some high praise, and I like the idea of a short, cinematic Spider-Man game to zip through.\nNice to hear that portable PC devices are a consideration too, for those who have been picking up a Steam Deck now that they're extremely available. The Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered PC port wound up being pretty good, and I'd hope the same holds true for Miles Morales' hop over to computers.\nMarvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales arrives on PC on November 18, 2022.\nThe post Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales swings onto PC in November appeared first on Destructoid.",

Taylor played the Umbra Witch in the first two games, but Platinum explained in our cover story that she wouldn’t reprise the role due to “various overlapping circumstances.” Taylor had been largely quiet on the issue, presumably due to a non-disclosure agreement, but has broken her silence with a fiery message claiming “immoral” compensation from Platinum as the reason her role was recast. \nFriends, Worldlings, Bayonutters.

The presentation featured an extended guided walkthrough showing off new gameplay footage as well as a rundown of features designed to make the game more terrifying than ever. \nThe video’s side-by-side comparisons illustrate the major differences between the original and the remake. One big change is that the Ishimura is now a seamless, interconnected ship that players can explore more freely. For example, using Isaac’s rocket thrusters to soar through areas you could only walk through before. A new system called the Intensity Spawn Director remixes necromorph spawn points, ensuring they’ll ambush veteran players in unexpected ways and, sometimes, in greater numbers. Dead Space also features improved necromorph dismemberment, new side quests designed to flesh out the supporting cast, new alternate fire modes for weapons, new puzzles, and more. \n\n\nDead Space launches on January 27 for PlayStation5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

Their name is Bellibolt, and they’re the signature partner of Iono, the newest gym leader from Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.\n\n\nIn Wednesday’s initial video, Iono introduced herself as not just a gym leader but also a streamer. She then asked her fictional followers to guess what her mystery partner Pokémon was based on a handful of details, including its type, the placement of its eyes, and the fact that it’s “so cute.” If you had trouble guessing, don't feel bad; today, we’ve learned that her partner is a new Pokémon altogether.\nNintendo and The Pokémon Company released a series of follow-up tweets, giving us new information about Bellibolt that sounds like it was pulled right from the Pokédex. One of the images reveals that they have a new ability called \"Electromorphosis,\" which allows Bellibolt to power up their next electric-type move after being hit by an attack.\nSay hello to the new EleFrog Pokémon, Bellibolt!\n#PokemonScarletViolet\nhttps://t.co/z7lNKThsDX pic.twitter.com/EUdcQcsUoA\nOctober 14, 2022\nYou'll be able to add Bellibolt to your team when Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet come to switch on November 18.

The narrative-driven sci-fi adventure will now launch in April to ensure it receives a final coat of polish.\nDeveloper Dramatic Labs announced the news on Twitter, stating it’s taking the extra time to ensure “a truly immersive Star Trek experience”. You can read the full statement below (click the image to enlarge).\nResurgence was first announced during The Game Awards 2021 and is a choice-driven adventure game that follows a similar design template to Telltale Games’ titles (Dramatic Labs consists of ex-Telltale employees). The story unfolds shortly after the events of Star Trek: The Next Generation as players control two original characters, an officer and a commander, to solve a mystery aboard the U.S.S. Resolute. The narrative and your relationships change depending on your choices, and gameplay features light combat and puzzle-solving. Resurgence is currently slated to launch on PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC. \nWe played a demo of Star Trek: Resurgence during Summer Game Fest in June, and you can read our hands-on impressions here.

Taking to the web-line and soaring across a wintery New York skyline is every bit as enthralling as it was before, and Miles develops into a fantastic hero.

          "description": "Final Fantasy VII The First Soldier, the mobile multiplayer battle royale, is being shut down in January. The news comes a month shy of the game's one-year anniversary, having launched for iOS and Android in November 2021. \nSquare Enix states that it feels it hasn’t delivered the experience it aimed for, so it will begin winding down service starting today. A roadmap on the game’s website lists a three-step sunsetting schedule. Today, you can no longer purchase Shinra credits from the shop, but you can still spend the credits you own until the game shuts down. On November 1, support for non-English localization ends (meaning text will only be displayed in English going forward). Finally, on January 11, The First Soldier goes offline for good.\nHere's the full End of Service announcement via Twitter:\nThe First Soldier was revealed in February 2021 alongside another mobile FFVII RPG, Ever Crisis (which has yet to release but has a closed beta planned for this year). The third-person battle royale took place before the events of FFVII and pit 75 players against each other as SOLDIER candidates. In addition to using firearms, players wield magic and even summons. Square previously stated The First Soldier was an attempt to attract a wider fanbase to the FFVII universe while giving existing fans a new way to enjoy its mythos. \nUnfortunately, this isn't the first Square Enix published multiplayer game to get the axe this year. Babylon's Fall, Platinum Games' live-service action RPG, is also being shutdown in February, less than a year after its ill-received launch. \nWhile The First Soldier is going away, plenty of FFVII content is in the pipeline. As previously mentioned, Ever Crisis remains on the docket, and Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion releases on December 13.

          "description": "The Pokémon Company and Nintendo have released a new Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet trailer all about Iono, the electric-type gym leader of Levincia and the most popular streamer in the Paldean region. \nIf you're expecting a look at Pokémon Scarlet and Violet gameplay or the reveal of some new Pokémon or gameplay mechanics, temper your expectations because this video is all about Iono. Check out the gym leader Iono trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, there's a lot going on in this new video. Iono is very much a Paldean influencer, which is a fun addition to the universe of Pokémon, but she's also a gym leader that we'll be facing off against in the game. As for her type, it's Electric, and while not confirmed, it seems the video is hinting toward a gym challenge for her. Before actually battling her, we might have to successfully complete her \"who's that Pokémon?\" test.\nIn this instance, she describes her very own Pokémon pal, but we don't get the answer. Perhaps we're meant to know what it is based on her description or maybe she's describing a Pokémon we haven't yet met. Only time will tell. Fortunately, we don't have to wait too much longer to meet this \"Supercharged Streamer\" because Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet hit Switch on November 18. \nIn the meantime, check out this 14-minute Pokémon Scarlet and Violet gameplay trailer from last week, and then watch this video all about Wiglett, a new Diglett-like Pokémon. Check out this trailer all about competitive play after that, and then read our Pokémon Scarlet and Violet preview for more details about Paldea, Terastallizing, and more. \nDo you have an idea of which Pokémon Iono is describing in today's trailer?

          "description": "Witchfire has been one of the most promising-looking shooters since its reveal in 2017. The dark fantasy romp was slated to launch in early access later this year, but a shift in design has forced developer The Astronauts to push that launch into next year.\nThe Astronauts has decided to rework Witchfire’s arena-style combat into an open-world format. Creative director Adrian Chmielarz writes in a blog post that the change makes Witchfire a “better” game. \n“The feature is now 95% implemented. It makes the game better. It is kind of hard for me to imagine the player did not have that freedom before. Sure, you can still be trapped by the witch in this or that spot, and some doors will be closed until you find a key, and it might be too dangerous to enter areas closer to the boss before you are ready– but the world is wide open for you to explore in almost any order, and you can both push forward and retreat as you please.”\nChmielarz also teases more Witchfire news to emerge in the next week or so. It won’t be gameplay footage but rather content promoting the game’s art and world in some fashion. \nWitchfire blends gunplay with the supernatural as players wield guns and magic to fend off otherworldly threats. The game is set in an alternate reality where you’re tasked with hunting down a witch at the behest of the church. The Astronauts previously developed The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, and the studio is made up of ex-People Can Fly employees. \nWitchfire is still slated to launch on PC via The Epic Game Store in early 2023. You can watch the most recent trailer from this year’s Summer Game Fest here.",

Inspired by series like Final Fight, Kung-Fu Master, and Karate Champ, the fighting genre emerged in arcades, buoyed by a few significant players in the space. One of those franchises was Mortal Kombat, a bloody, gory fighting game that took concepts from other fighting games and dialed them to 11. The series became notorious for its spine-ripping, heart-grabbing, limb-chopping action, but beneath the controversies and the hearings was a technically sound, capable fighting game. \nThe Mortal Kombat franchise has continued to grow and evolve, showcasing massive staying power in a sometimes ruthless industry.

Spoiler for Bayonetta 1: Cereza is the child version of Bayonetta, so perhaps our hero simply wanted to return to her adolescent roots. However, the third game's focus on the multiverse has prompted some fans to consider a more tantalizing theory. \nFirst, to provide some context, here's a (relatively) quick refresher of Bayonetta's backstory for newcomers or lapsed fans. Five hundred years prior to the events of the first game, Bayonetta, whose real name is Cereza, was born the child of an Umbra Witch and a Lumen Sage.

It features the slick realistic visuals fans of the series know quite well but this time, it's mixed with an almost anime-like animation style. It looks great, in my opinion, but it likely won't be for everybody. \nCheck out the Need For Speed Unbound reveal trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Unbound represents a pretty drastic departure for the series in terms of visuals but elsewhere, it looks like Need For Speed.

One of the less-discussed casualties of the news was that Tequila Works’ Gylt, a horror adventure game and the first Stadia-exclusive title, would disappear entirely. Thankfully, that won’t be the case.\nTequila Works has confirmed that it plans to make Gylt multiplatform in 2023. It doesn’t specify which platforms the game will become available on, but it’s a relief to know that one of Stadia’s few original gems won’t be lost to history. \n🎃 We bring terrific news: GYLT is going multiplatform in 2023! More info to come in the upcoming months.https://t.co/ON1pbiGsB9 pic.twitter.com/2sWdseym2G\nOctober 4, 2022\nGylt launched in November 2019 alongside Stadia. It stars a young girl named Sally who searches for her missing cousin across a town haunted by evil spirits. The narrative also serves a commentary on bullying and depresssion. The game’s vibe and art direction evoke films like Coraline or Tim Burton’s animated works and channels games like Inside and Silent Hill. Gameplay emphasizes stealth, with players using a flashlight to defeat enemies. Despite its more innocent veneer, the game has its share of genuinely creepy moments, and I personally found it to be an enjoyable horror romp.\nWill you be checking out Gylt before Stadia shuts down or wait to play it elsewhere next year?

          "description": "Sony announced its new gaming loyalty program, PlayStation Stars, back in July, and the service is now live in North and South America. PlayStation users can sign up for the free program, but there’s one big caveat.\nPlayStation Stars allows players to earn points and digital collectibles by completing “campaigns,” which range from completing small objectives while playing games to larger monthly challenges. Any PlayStation player can join Stars; you don’t need a Plus subscription. \nCompleting campaigns also raises your Star Status, a leveling system consisting of four ranks. Everyone begins at Level 1, but doing things like purchasing games from PSN or earning a certain number of trophy rarities raises this level, increasing the quality of rewards you earn. \nDigital rewards, which Sony confirmed are not NFTs and cannot be resold, include models of old PlayStation consoles and characters from first-party titles. You can also redeem points to use as funds for your digital store wallet and to purchase DLC. Points remain available for 24 months after earning them. \nIf you’re running to sign up now, there’s already a waitlist to join PS Stars. Sony states that new users will have to wait about two months after the date they register to be accepted into the program. It's unclear why this is the case, but one could assume Sony doesn't want to be flooded with too many memberships at once as it gradually gets the program off the ground. Registration also doesn't seem consistent yet, as some folks were immediately let in while others have been told to wait (and some others still can't access Stars in parts of the U.S. as of publishing). \nPlayStation Stars will launch in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand next week on October 13. To learn more about the program, including its handy FAQ, you can visit its official site here.",

          "description": "Bandai Namco has released a new trailer for the new-gen release of Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot alongside news that it hits PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S in January. \nMore specifically, Kakarot comes to new-gen consoles on January 13, 2023, meaning we're just a few months away from this re-release. To accompany today's news, Bandai Namco has released a new trailer showcasing some of DBZ's most iconic moments alongside some comparison clips between the PlayStation 4/Xbox One version of Kakarot and the upcoming new-gen update. Unsurprisingly, it looks a lot better. \nCheck it out for yourself below: \n\n\nKakarot on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S features updated visuals that look even better than the original release and 60 frames-per-second gameplay. If you already own the game, you can upgrade to the new-gen version of Kakarot for free. \nThis new trailer also teases what's to come in the game's second season pass. The first DLC is called Bardock: Alone Against Fate, and it's a new story arc. Two more story arc DLCs are in the season pass as well. Plus, Season Pass 2 owners will get a cooking item that increases HP and Ki defense. \nWhile waiting for January, read Game Informer's Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot review to find out why we think the game is flawed but still highly enthralling. \nAre you going to check out the new-gen version of Kakarot next year?

Instead, the Umbra Witch is brought to life by veteran performer Jennifer Hale.\n“Various overlapping circumstances made it difficult for Hellena Taylor to reprise her role,” says game director Yusuke Miyata. “We held auditions to cast the new voice of Bayonetta and offered the role to Jennifer Hale, whom…",
