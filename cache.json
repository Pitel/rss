As a sword-swinging action JRPG set in a dystopian future, this decision made a lot of sense. After seven long months of silence on the project, however, this weekend's Aniplex Online Fest provided us with some brand new details on the series, including what we can expect from its story and setting its release date for January 2023.\nThe announcement trailer (found above) features interviews with the original game director Yoko Taro and the series director, Ryoji Mausyama, as well as the anime's two lead cast members, Yui Ishikawa and Natsuke Hanae. The former of these conversations is particularly interesting in respect to the anime's relationship to the game's story.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "\"We have 2D Zelda at home\".\nIt’s said that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and if that is indeed the case, then Airoheart is one of the most sycophantic releases on the Switch today. There's certainly no shortage of 'Zelda-likes' available on the console, but this is a game that stretches the term “inspired by” to its absolute limits, as it finds as many ways as possible to be The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past without actually tempting Nintendo into releasing its famed copyright ninjas for damage control. Consequently, fans of that top-down Zelda style will no doubt find much to love here, as Airoheart does an adequate job of presenting a wide linear action-adventure experience, but it more often than not feels like you’re looking at a funhouse mirror reflection rather than the real deal.\nAiroheart is set in the fantasy land of Engard and follows the tale of two feuding groups: the Elmer and the Breton. The Elmer are masters of peaceful forms of magic while the Breton are proficient in more offensive and violent magical abilities, and there’s been tension between the two groups for as long as anyone can remember. Your character, a half-Breton named Airoheart who lives among the Elmer with his grandpa, is brothers with a Breton leader who is instigating increasingly more aggressive maneuvers against the Elmer in what appears to be a prelude to war. He seems to be most interested, however, in retrieving the fragments of the mythical Draoidhe Stone, a magical MacGuffin that will all but guarantee a swift Breton victory. Guided by a mysterious disembodied voice, Airoheart thus sets out on a quest to retrieve the fragments before the Breton can get their hands on them.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Boil 'em, mash 'em, stick 'em in a RPG.\nThe year was 2002. Peter Jackson was about to release the second instalment in the Lord of the Rings movie trilogy, EA had bagged the rights to the video game adaptations of the films and Vivendi was just about to release its own console adaptation, not of the New Line Cinema property, but adapted directly from the Tolkien-penned source material.\nIt is hardly a hot take to say that the motion picture trilogy is fantastic. The fellowship is perfectly cast, Howard Shore’s score stands up today as one of the greatest of all time, and each film efficiently serves Tolkien’s original work through the scope of their worldbuilding. Though even with a combined runtime just short of 12 hours (extended editions, of course), the films could never really capture the entirety of the world about which Tolkien had written.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It grabbed hearts and hasn’t let go for 32 years. In 1991, he concluded Monkey Island 2: LeChuck’s Revenge on a bombshell cliffhanger. In 1992, he departed Lucasarts, and the secret third part of his trilogy went down in legend like a sunken ship. Fan communities theorised and fantasised for a couple of decades about where the story might have been going, desperate for confirmation from Gilbert or his colleagues.\nIn 2013, Gilbert wrote, “I always envisioned the game as a trilogy” – one he could only make with “complete control over what  was making and the only way to do that is to own it.” In 2015 he wrote, “Monkey Island is now owned by Disney and they haven't shown any desire to sell me the IP.” The fans’ final gasp of what if? was snuffed. He bemoaned April Fools’ day annually on his blog, staying proudly “Fools’ day free” for 18 years. He once tweeted, “If I ever get to make another Monkey Island, I’m going to announce it on April 1st”.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "The RPS-beloved turn-based strategy game Solium Infernum is back from the dead. Announced earlier today on stage at EGX London 2022, Armello creators League Of Geeks will be resurrecting and reimagining the game in 2023. Originally released in 2009 by solo dev Vic Davis and his studio Cryptic Comet, Solium Infernum cast you as an Archfiend hoping to stake a claim for Satan's empty throne. With a strong emphasis on political intrigue and Machiavellian backstabbing over taking things by force, this strategy game from hell was a firm RPS favourite back in the day, spawning an eight-part diary series of the team's play-by-email multiplayer adventures. Alas, it never quite found the audience it deserved back in the early 2010s, eventually causing Davis to shut up shop completely in 2015 and pursue a career in tabletop.\nLeague Of Geeks are here to change that, though, and after speaking with studio director and co-founder Trent Kusters (both at EGX earlier today and during a hands-off presentation of their pre-alpha demo late last week), it's clear the team have taken great care in bringing Solium Infernum up to date for modern audiences. It leans into all the same kinds of mind games as Cryptic Comet's original, and its simultaneous turn structure is still very much intact – just with lusher 3D visuals, and all-new, revamped menu screens. And it looks devilishly good.\nRead more",

They welcome an interruption - a friendly natter or helpful hand - but whether you’re there or not, they’ll go about their business regardless. The world keeps on spinning and all that.\nIt’s an interesting way of capturing the passage of time, and in Wayward Strand how you choose to spend that time is pretty important in a game that makes a point of not waiting for you.\nRead more",

Maybe it’s the selection of classic bangers such as Old Grey Mare and Take Me Out To The Ballgame, or perhaps it's the constant prompts of NASTY and PERFECTO, but devs Holy Wow seem to be on to a winner.

          "description": "Have you ever played a game and thought, \"Are we actually the bad guys here?\" Usually, the whole \"we're fighting on the wrong side of history\" line is a deliberate plot device in RPGs, offering moments of clarity to not only peel back the curtain and provide fresh impetus for the events yet to come, but also to cleverly reframe everything you've achieved so far. I don't say this to spoil the events of The DioField Chronicle, the new real-time strategy game from Lancarse and Square Enix, but it is a question I found myself asking a lot during its middle act - and it never quite delivers the punchline you're looking for. \nAround 8-10 hours into the game, there's an extended portion of the campaign that sees your band of Blue Fox mercenaries bringing an entire region of DioField Island to heel because they're, err, pro democracy. Of the cast's central quartet, only one stands up as a voice of reason when motions are made to quell these despicable riots, but he's repeatedly shot down every time he tries to offer an alternate view. Eventually, one character says to him, and I quote, \"Isca, what has got into you? You ought to know the danger posed by the ideology of democracy.\" It's an odd stance for someone clearly not a villain to take in 2022, although really, I should have probably seen it coming. Our mercs work for a duke after all, and most are aristocratic nobles who are handy with a sword. Oh no. I think this might actually be played: Tories - The Game. Yuck. \nRead more",

More importantly, you can flip back and forth between these pivotal moments at any time, allowing you to deploy new words in earlier chapters to see what happens.\r\n\nExcept, Beacon Pines is far less choice-driven than I expected.

In Hyper Demon, a long and cautious run will likely score lower than a short burst of ultraviolence. What glorious ultraviolence it is!\nWhen I first saw Hyper Demon's trailer, I felt excitement, wonder, and fear.

These supposedly add up to twice the performance of Ampere (that’s the RTX 30 series architecture currently dominating our best graphics card guide) in standard rasterised games, and up to four times the performance in ray traced games. And since Nvidia were clearly in a ray-tracey mood, they also took the opportunity to reveal Portal RTX: a semi-official mod for the original Portal that upgrades it with RT lighting and reflection effects.

          "description": "Castle Dimitrescu was one of the many highlights of Resident Evil Village, so it makes sense that Capcom are returning to it in the game's upcoming DLC adventure, Shadows Of Rose. Set 16 years after the events of Village, this story expansion centres on Rose, the daughter of Village protagonist Ethan Winters, as she comes to terms with her emerging mold powers. She was just a teeny, tiny baby when her dad was fighting off the very tall vampire lady in the base game, but now she's all grown up and wants to be rid of the supernatural spore abilities that have been plaguing her family ever since the events of Resident Evil 7. \nIt's not yet clear what role Lady D's castle has to play in Rose's journey, but man, it sure is nice to be back roaming its ornate hallways again. Or rather it would be, if it weren't for all the ashen mold men stalking its corridors, and its rather gross (but strangely hypnotic) rivers of undulating strawberry jam gore that have been plastered all over the walls, floor and ceiling. Ach, now it's on my shoes. Great. And the gate's locked behind me. Fantastic. I knew coming back here would be a bad idea…\nRead more",

Technically, none of this should come as a surprise. Not only are they all Street Fighter faithfuls, but pretty much the entire cast list got leaked back in June thanks to some rogue character art. One thing that has been pleasantly surprising, however, is learning that Ken, pictured in that leaked document as looking rather dishevelled and rocking a bit of a 'sad, middle-aged dad' look, is anything but.\nIndeed, when I went to play the latest build of Street Fighter 6 at Capcom's UK offices earlier in the week, Ken was absolutely killing it. Rather than suffering from a mid-life crisis, Ken was hauling it across the screen like an absolute battering ram, clearly full of the same mad protein shakes his mate Ryu's been hawking down since their last SF outing, as both of them have gone full-on Redfield Beefcake this time. \nRead more",

Their creature, Onbu, is a colossal six-legged beast, and the walking platform on which your village sits, a plateau of flat land mass on its back making for an excellent settlement ground. Onbu is best described as a gentle giant.

          "description": "Hand Of Fate was such a singular thing. On the one hand, it was a tabletop deckbuilding game that saw you picking through roguelike-style dungeons by choosing different cards dealt out by its mysterious Dealer. On the other, it was also an action-packed hack and slasher, bringing its fantastical fight sections to life in fully 3D combat arenas - and there hasn't been anything quite like it since. Voice Of Cards certainly had a go, but its tedious battle system landed it straight on its own discard pile. Thankfully, we've now got the infinitely more engaging Foretales, a new narrative card game from French developers Alkemi, and it comes pretty damn close to capturing that Hand Of Fate goodness. \nIt doesn't ever venture into the realms of 3D admittedly, erring more toward the Inscryption school of tabletop combat encounters, but it does nail the delivery of telling an artful, swashbuckling adventure through cards and cards alone. And much like Hand Of Fate, this isn't a one and done affair, either, as there are multiple paths to take through this entertaining fantasy yarn, and several game-changing decisions you'll have to make as you try and avert a string of terrible visions threatening to destroy its anthropomorphic animal world. You won't succeed at preventing them all during a single playthrough, but its hard choices only make its overarching story that much more gripping. \nRead more",

This mystery title will no doubt set Silent Hill fans' tongues wagging, given that we have been fed numerous rumors and whispers regarding a new sequel in the legendary horror franchise for well over a year now.\nWhile there is most certainly the possibility of The Short Message referring to a mobile title or some other spin-off, it is definitely high time that these long-running rumors finally paid off. Perhaps we will hear something official from Konami before the year is out — Say at the December Game Awards show or similar. Either way, it's something new to bite into, so make sure you clean your fog lamps and change the batteries in your torch...\nSomething Wicked this way Comes...\nThe post Silent Hill: The Short Message listed by Korean ratings board appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Too old for all these stairs...\nRetro publisher Hamster can't get off of its Namco kick at the moment, bringing something particularly leftfield to the Arcade Archives this week. Now available on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, it's dungeon-crawling classic The Return of Ishtar.\nReleased to arcades in 1986, before being ported to formative platforms such as the Sharp X68000 and the Fujitsu FM-7, The Return of Ishtar is a sequel to 1984's The Tower of Druaga, and is the second release in the cute 'n' compact Babylonian Castle Saga. Set immediately after the events of Druaga, Ishtar sees hero Gilgamesh and the freshly rescued maiden, Ki, as they attempt to escape the sky-high dungeon. You can check out the action in the trailer below, courtesy of YouTuber Replay Burners.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OU3vefMlng\nAs something of a novelty, The Return of Ishtar features co-op two-player action, with player one controlling Gilgamesh and player two guiding Ki. The former uses his steel weaponry to defeat various ghosts 'n' ghoulies, while the latter is equipped with a variety of magic attacks to fend off evildoers. As a duo, the protagonists must battle through the tower's 60 floors, hosting over 120 screens — quite the epic for what is, purportedly, a coin-chomping arcade release.\nThe Return of Ishtar would be followed up by several sequels, spin-offs, and even a prequel, in the form of 1988's The Quest of Ki. This title told the tale of the maiden's doomed quest to reach the top of the tower, which would ultimately lead to her imprisonment and, thus, the events of the original game. Pretty in-depth and savvy game continuity for the early years of the genre.\nThe Return of Ishtar is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch. The Tower of Druaga joined the Arcade Archives back in June of this year.\nThe post The fated tower is back in Arcade Archives’ The Return of Ishtar appeared first on Destructoid.",

One notable change is not in its roster or tactical gameplay, but the characters themselves. The Rabbids in Sparks of Hope can talk.\nUbisoft's Rabbids are often portrayed as goofy, cartoon-ish animals who tend to simply speak in \"bwahs\" and exclamations, not explicit dialogue. Several outlets attended a preview event for Sparks of Hope and reported back that those Rabbids are talking.\nSpeaking to IGN, creative director Davide Soliani describes his early experience working with Kingdom Battle.

          "description": "Don't panic, but the floor *is* lava\nIt's a great feeling to be the good-news bearer when one of your favorite co-op games gets new content and you get to excitedly tell your partner all about it. For those of us who like the puzzle-platformer antics of Human: Fall Flat, there's a new level, Tower, out now on Steam. Including the original and post-launch stages, it's the 21st level.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkzAQCA4r1o\nThe name speaks for itself. With such a precarious layout, I'm afraid of my pudgy boy plummeting to his doom, but at least Human: Fall Flat is generous with checkpoints.\n\"Dreamed up by creative mastermind Fennecai and brought to life by the fiendishly talented David,\" Tower is the winner of the game's 5th Anniversary level design competition. And right on cue, Curve Games says there is \"still more to come.\"\nAs usual, console players have to wait\nUnfortunately, the console versions aren't in sync with the Steam edition, so PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch players will have to wait to play the Tower level in Human: Fall Flat. That said, if it's been a while, you might have new-to-you levels ready to go.\nI recently checked back in and found a couple of levels — Red Rock and Lumber — in our backlog. We blasted through them. Even with overlapping ideas, I'm still having fun.\nWith 30 million copies sold and more content updates lined up, I'm wondering when, if ever, we'll see a sequel. I'm pretty happy with the split-screen performance on a PS5, but it would be nice to see an overhauled sequel that feels more refined. Just a bit.\nFor now, they're squeezing every last drop — and I'm okay with it.\nThe post Human: Fall Flat has a new Tower level to fumble through with friends appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The slimy indie hit returns\nLots of great indie games have been getting a lot of love this year — Stray was Annapurna's biggest launch by far, and Cult of the Lamb had over a million players in a week. Now it looks like Slime Rancher 2 is joining those ranks, because it has reached a big milestone of over 100,000 copies within the first six hours of its release. Nick Popovich, co-founder and CEO of the studio behind the Slime Rancher series Monomi Park, shared a tweet yesterday thanking fans for making the game a success.\nFor those who may not be familiar, the first Slime Rancher game came out back in 2017 after about a year of being in early access. In the game, players take on the role of a farmer tasked with collecting and breeding different types of slimes on their very own ranch, all wrapped up in an open-world FPS-style packaging. Critical reception to Slime Rancher was favorable, but over the years it garnered something of a cult following, and got PlayStation and Switch releases years after its initial launch for PC and Xbox.\nhttps://twitter.com/NickPopovich/status/1573097739507875843\nAnecdotally, I've seen love for the Slime Rancher series spread through word of mouth more than anything — it's another one of those cozy farming-style games that players just can't seem to get enough of. It's exciting to see the devs put out a sequel to the beloved indie game that has been met with nearly universal praise, because maintaining that momentum can be difficult.\n100,000 may seem like a relatively small number compared to some huge launches that can be in the millions, but for an indie studio, that can be life-changing. Here's hoping we continue to see more great things from Monomi Park, because they've managed to tap into a certain kind of magic that we don't see very often.\nThe post Slime Rancher 2 sold over 100K copies in less than six hours appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Hey, it's a lot less confusing than the Zelda timeline(s)\nShovel Knight Dig is out this weekend, and right on time, Yacht Club Games has swooped in to give a bit of context to this spinoff. Well, prequel, actually!\nSpeaking to Nintendo Life, Yacht Club Games Marketing Manager Celia Schilling confirmed that Dig does indeed take place before the events of every game/DLC:\n\"Story wise, Shovel Knight Dig is the first game in the Shovel Knight series. That makes it a prequel that takes place even before Specter of Torment! You might remember the intro line from the first Shovel Knight game - 'Long ago, the lands were untamed, and roamed by legendary adventurers.' Well, Dig takes you back to these good ‘ol days, when Shovel Knight and Shield Knight quested together, fighting baddies and seeking treasure! We hope fans will be interested to play the events leading up to the original saga.\"\n\n\nTechnically, it goes Shovel Knight Dig, then the Specter of Torment flashbacks, then King of Cards, then Specter of Torment, Shovel Knight Showdown, Plague of Shadows, Shovel of Hope (the core original release), then Pocket Dungeon is officially a sequel, and the last game in the series at present.\nSchilling even goes into detail about the Hexcavators (the new crew/bad guy rogue's gallery group), and why its leader (Drill Knight) wouldn't want to join the Order of No Quarter: he'd see it as a downgrade. Also at this time, Specter Knight is still in his non-Order form of Donovan, and other characters are off doing other things before they meet up for the events of Shovel of Hope.\nIt's great to see that after eight years and counting, Yacht Club cares enough about this series to dive into the minutiae of character-specific lore. It's a big reason why I enjoyed Shovel Knight Dig so much, as that Hades approach to slowly uncovering more about the game world was so obviously present.\nThe post Shovel Knight Dig is a prequel, as Yacht Club reveals the full timeline appeared first on Destructoid.",

Specifically, they're taking a look at updating it for a \"modern day\" audience.\nAs spotted by PSU, a scriptwriter opening for the Splinter Cell remake is open on Ubisoft's site. Alongside working on the Snowdrop engine to rebuild a stealth classic, it looks like the writing staff will also be retooling the narrative.\nHere's an excerpt from the listing:\n\"Using the first Splinter Cell game as our foundation we are rewriting and updating the story for a modern-day audience. We want to keep the spirit and themes of the original game while exploring our characters and the world to make them more authentic and believable. As a Scriptwriter at Ubisoft Toronto, you will join the Narrative team and help create a cohesive and compelling narrative experience for a new audience of Splinter Cell fans.\"\n\nIt's unclear what that entails, outside of possibly incorporating modern ideas into the spy story. Maybe Sam will have to quietly distribute food deliveries along his intended route. Or perhaps he'll get distracted during a pivotal moment when one of his tweets goes viral. We do live in really weird times.\nThe return of Splinter Cell\nThe Splinter Cell remake got confirmed at the end of 2021. Ubisoft Toronto is heading up development on the remake, using the same Snowdrop engine powering Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora.\nThe team's been pretty quiet since though, outside of confirming a few things. The new-old Splinter Cell will remain linear and not open-world, so in some ways it definitely sounds like they're adhering to the original.\nStill, a \"modern\" story for Sam has me, at the very least, curious.

It showcases the encroaching threat of the army of the dead nicely, while showcasing a ton of in-game Wrath of the Lich King expansion locations that are fitting for an after-the-fact re-release trailer. A lot of key players are present to give the trailer that official feel, and frankly the war itself looks more urgent than it does in the actual game. Lich King players (the millions out there) will likely enjoy seeing some of the nostalgic locations, too.\nAnd it seems like it took a lot of work! For their previous video, here's how Hurricane did it: \"The trailer took 10 months to make and it's been made entirely in Cinema 4D (meaning no in-game footage has been used). Its development has been made possible due to the extensive use of the Marlamin's Export Tools and Jeromnimo's WoW Model Viewer).\nThe actual World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King Classic expansion is out on September 26, at 3:00PM PT exactly (which sets the pace for the worldwide launch).\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-__XX2HEkA\nThe post Wrath of the Lich King Classic just got a new official trailer, made by a fan appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It's out \"this fall\"\nA Disney Dreamlight Valley Toy Story update is on the way, and now we have a full-length trailer to see what that actually entails.\nLike most character-based things in Dreamlight, it'll feature new quests (with Woody and Buzz), as well as an additional space to roam around in, and new items. Based on the trailer you'll enter the new space similar to the other lands in the game (like Moana): through a special door in the castle. This time, the Toy Story realm is symbolized by a drawing of an alien head.\nDisney Dreamlight Valley kind of snuck up on me. The Early Access release model + the monetization scheme + Gameloft being involved kept me wary, but after a few positive hands-on impressions, I decided to give it a shot. It's not bad! There is some free-to-play nonsense baked in, but there's a lot you can do, especially upfront, in the current build. It's a different take on the farming/simulation genre in many ways, as it's heavily tied to quests and key characters, which makes sense for an IP factory like Disney.\nIn any case, there's time to shore up some gameplay-related concerns before it launches next year, but I'm not hopeful about the monetization element — especially post-launch.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lStz8KPOHl8\nThe post Here’s a look at Disney Dreamlight Valley’s Toy Story update appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Over on the game's Japanese Twitter account\nFire Emblem Engage was announced roughly a week ago, and it's coming out in January. Naturally, a lot of what the game has to offer is a mystery, but we do know that it features a new polarizing protagonist design, and will allow players to summon classic characters from the series. It really feels like a lot of the gaps are filled in already. We know the full release date (January 20, 2023) and that it'll be roughly 15GB in size. We also have a bit more to go off of than the initial trailer reveal thanks to some Fire Emblem Engage gameplay strewn about the Japanese Fire Emblem Twitter account.\nAll sorts of things can be discerned from this footage, including movement ranges (which will likely carry over to the final build, given that it's out in a few short months), animations, map design, class nuance, sound effect quality, and Japanese vocals. Plus, we even get a look at some downtime and character dialogue! This latest batch includes a young-ish character voiced by Kohei Amazaki, described as a guardian who assists the divine dragon. We got a look at another guardian, voiced by Yoji Ueda, last week.\nIt'll be hard to top the tri-story nature of Three Houses for many fans (though I know there are people who will be happy to get back to basics), but I'm hopeful for Fire Emblem Engage. There's bits and pieces I dig so far, namely the idea of mining nostalgia; I just hope it's done well from a gameplay perspective.\nhttps://twitter.com/FireEmblemJP/status/1572858487335534593\nhttps://twitter.com/FireEmblemJP/status/1572858738834292738\n[Thanks Jeff!]\nThe post Nintendo dropped a handful of Fire Emblem Engage gameplay clips appeared first on Destructoid.",

The trailer will be made available online, October 6, at 13:00 PT / 16:00 ET / 21:00 BST, and will give us all our very first look at the new movie in action.\nWhile nothing has been revealed in regards to the movie's narrative or visual style, we do, of course, know that the famous pipe-plunging hero will be portrayed by Chris Pratt, star of the great Guardians of the Galaxy and terrible Jurassic World movies. Joining Pratt in the Mushroom Kingdom will be Anna Taylor-Joy as Princess Daisy, Jack Black as Bowser, Charlie Day as Luigi and... sigh... Seth Rogan as Donkey Kong.\nLook, we'll see soon enough, ok?

But in a new interview with Bloomberg, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella expresses confidence in the Activision Blizzard deal getting approved.\nThe UK Competition and Markets Authority is investigating the deal. After an initial phase, the regulator has opted to conduct a more in-depth \"phase 2\" investigation. The CMA is looking into whether the deal will have a realistic prospect of substantially lessening competition in gaming.\nSpeaking to Bloomberg, Microsoft CEO Nadella says he's confident the company will gain regulatory approval for the $69 billion acquisition.\n\"Of course, any acquisition of this size will go through scrutiny, but we feel very, very confident that we'll come out,\" said Nadella.\nThe CEO also points to Sony, which has made a number of acquisitions itself. \"So if this is about competition, let us have competition,\" Nadella says.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnsOrbljnK0\nMajor mergers\nTensions have been rising around the Microsoft and Activision Blizzard deal. The potential merger has been under scrutiny since it was announced earlier this year, but recently, both Xbox and PlayStation have been addressing it a bit more candidly.\nReports circled that Microsoft had committed to keeping Call of Duty on PlayStation for \"several more years\" beyond the existing deal. In a statement to GamesIndustry.biz, PlayStation CEO Jim Ryan said the offer was \"inadequate on many levels\".\nSony has indeed been picking up several studios. The PlayStation manufacturer has brought on Returnal developer Housemarque, Demon's Souls remake creator Bluepoint, and Destiny studio Bungie to name a few.\nThe size and scope of the ABK deal for Microsoft is massive, though.

          "description": "Well, the latest answer is good news\nThis morning, the official Ubisoft Support Twitter account seemingly confirmed a Ubisoft Connect requirement for Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope. It was met with immediate dismay from fans, on the very day the game had gone gold. After the tweet was swiftly deleted we reached out to Ubisoft for comment — but that same account later cleared things up.\nThe new tweet states rather succinctly: \"A Ubisoft Connect account isn't mandatory for players to play Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope, contrary to what has been wrongfully mentioned by one of our previous tweets.\" It seems to be a definitive statement on the matter, as a direct follow-up and acknowledgment of the prior error. In any case, with Nintendo heavily involved, it would be a bad look if a single-player adventure game required a third-party sign-on.\nUbisoft has been pushing Connect wherever it can, and is still operating the Ubisoft Connect launcher (formerly uPlay) and storefront. Conversely, several studios have closed down or otherwise downplayed their launchers, in favor of migrating to more prevalent platforms. It's one thing to have it strewn about an Assassin's Creed game for bits and bob bonus points, but it's not going to get quite that same pass with Sparks of Hope.\nThe mere mention of a login requirement really brought me back to the 2010s, and the battle of the launchers, though: when you had the added baggage of extra logins, but none of the bonuses like cross-play. It was a dark time.\nThe post Ubisoft confirms, then deconfirms Ubisoft Connect requirement for Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope appeared first on Destructoid.",

Maniac Mansion is a wonderfully well-designed puzzle box, but Secret of Monkey Island is a symphony. Its puzzle design is near perfect, and its humorous script makes it extraordinarily rewarding to solve them.\nMonkey Island 2 might be better than that, but following those two hits, the series took a dive.

          "description": "You'll be able to build homes from scratch in the sequel\nFor as many granular simulation games as we get these days, it's not that common to see a full-on numbered sequel. But 2018's House Flipper broke through with three million copies sold across PC and consoles, and that was enough for House Flipper 2 to get the green light. Here's our first look at gameplay, including a noticeably less \"basic\" art style.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOQCo2rLpdU\nI liked the original game for what it was, though I ended up craving a more complete experience with a bigger scope. Cleaning up nasty homes and renovating them is a concept that pretty much sells itself in the simulation space, so I'm happy to see the developers at Frozen District try again, presumably with more runway this time.\nThe big change: on top of the returning Story mode, there's going to be a Sandbox mode in which you can \"build homes from scratch\" rather than just shore up existing ones.\n \"We’ve put a lot of heart and story into House Flipper 2, polishing our trusty tools, focusing on player creativity, and adding mysteries to uncover,\" said lead producer Jakub Bujas in a press statement. \"We think returning fans and brand new players alike will enjoy relaxing, creating, and exploring the community of Pinnacove.\"\nWith the widespread warm reception to PowerWash Simulator recently, I feel like more people are giving these sorts of games a chance. And as much as some publishers take a shotgun approach to figuring out the next big sim subject matter (with plenty of duds in the process), among those games that do resonate, the quality bar seems to be rising.\nIf I'm being honest, I'd play a simple \"home-cleaning simulator\" — it's oddly relaxing! — but having a well-rounded renovation and home-building loop will go a long way.\nHouse Flipper 2 is coming to Steam sometime in 2023, and PlayStation and Xbox versions are also planned.\nThe post House Flipper 2 looks like a big step up appeared first on Destructoid.",

It hasn't exactly been on my mind given the sheer number of games coming out in October and November, but this new overview trailer perked me up.\nIn short, this spinoff deals with Erik and Mia, a brother and sister duo who \"dream of exploring the world in search of grand treasure.\" To do so, you'll team up with various monsters, who can provide various abilities to the party to find...more treasure. The gameplay loop seems incredibly carefree, mixed with the signature style of the Dragon Quest series.\nIn the below four-ish minute video, Square Enix runs you through the basics, including treasure hunting itself (including the various means of traversal), as well as recruitment, the hub/base mechanic, and the main storyline (which deals with rival gangs and the narrative involving the seven rare Dragonstones). Party building in particular looks fun, as your minions can also act out of combat: serving as mounts, and abilities of sorts (like having one throw you up in the air).\nLike Monster Hunter, I always at least give these Dragon Quest spinoffs a second look. The series has built up so much goodwill at this point, and if I can fit it into my schedule, Dragon Quest Treasures seems like it'll be a breezy December/winter game.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsbBsH9tESc\nThe post Dragon Quest Treasures looks extremely cute appeared first on Destructoid.",

Square Enix confirms today the re-release of Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth is delayed to December.\nOriginally a PSP port of the PlayStation 1 classic Valkyrie Profile, Lenneth is set to get a PS4 and PS5 version too. It was meant to coincide with the launch of Valkyrie Elysium on September 29. But to bring it all together, Square is taking a little extra time.\n\"As we celebrate the launch of Valkyrie Elysium, we unfortunately need a bit more time for Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth to improve the quality of the title and have decided to move the release date to December 22nd, 2022,\" the statement reads.\nhttps://twitter.com/ValkyrieGame/status/1572913851783421952\nThose who pre-ordered the Digital Deluxe version of Elysium will still be able to get their copy of Lenneth. It will, however, be arriving several months later than expected.\nSwapping profiles\nIt's hard to not be curious about why this particular part of Valkyrie Elysium's rollout has been pushed back. It would put Valkyrie Profile on a modern console, which would be a huge boon for folks who want to dive back into that story.\nStill, a little more time is worth it if it means a good port. And now this puts Lenneth squarely within the holidays. No better way to celebrate family and give thanks than recruiting soldiers for the impending war of Ragnarok.\nValkyrie Elysium, meanwhile, is still arriving on September 29 for PS4 and PS5. I got a chance to check out the demo ahead of its launch. The combat is surprisingly solid, even as it moves the needle from RPG over to action.

          "description": "Dinos and Dice\nEpic Games Store has revealed the two new titles that it will be offering up gratis this week. As of Thursday, September 22, all EGS users will be able to download Studio Wildcard's Ark: Survival Evolved and Asmodee Digital's Gloomhaven completely free of charge.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fIAPcVdZO8\nReleased for PC and consoles way back in 2017, Ark: Survival Evolved is — as its name denotes — a survival title set in an anachronistic prehistoric world. As a human outfitted with more modern technologies, players must build bases and habitats within a huge open world, gathering resources and increasing defenses while fending off attacks from rampaging packs of dinosaurs and potentially hostile human players. Players can also capture and tame dinosaurs for transport and guard duties.\nOriginally released for Steam Early Access back in 2015, developer Studio Wildcard has slowly built upon the original title in the ensuing years, adding more features, PvE modes, additional dinosaurs, and expansive new lands, objectives, and questlines. Ark: Survival Evolved would be ported to mobile and Nintendo Switch in 2018, and the Stadia platform in 2021.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SGDEP-zFHo\nDeveloped by Flaming Fowl Studios, Gloomhaven is a digital adaptation of the fantasy tabletop title of the same name. Set against the backdrop of the grim titular 'berg, players guide packs of class-based mercenaries on quests and missions, utilizing their characters' unique skills and abilities to overcome any opposition. The digital edition of Gloomhaven is, more or less, a direct adaptation of the tabletop game, following the same rules and objectives of its physical source.\nBoth Ark: Survival Evolved and Gloomhaven will be free on the Epic Games Store from September 22 until September 29.\nNext week's free games will be Runbow and The Drone Racing League.\nThe post Ark: Survival Evolved and Gloomhaven are Epic Games Store’s latest free titles appeared first on Destructoid.",

Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. \nMetal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. \nWatch on Twitch!\nJoin me, Marcus Stewart, along with Blake Hester as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure.

          "description": "The Apple TV show Ted Lasso has proven to be one of the most popular and well-liked series of the last few years, introducing viewers to a lovable cast of characters whose lives and storylines largely revolve around the fictional English Premier League football club, AFC Richmond. Through its first two seasons, the series has taken home numerous awards, including the Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series in 2021 and 2022, with several of its actors – including Jason Sudeikis, Brett Goldstein, and Hannah Waddingham – taking home awards for original performances. Now, Ted Lasso reaches into a new realm: video games. \nEA Sports today announced that Ted Lasso and AFC Richmond are joining the FIFA 23 roster of teams. Lasso is joined on the sidelines by Coach Beard, with the pitch being populated by some of the team's biggest stars like Jamie Tartt, Roy Kent, Dani Rojas, Sam Obisanya, and Isaac McAdoo. While the actors' likenesses are included in the product, EA Sports hasn't indicated if we'll be hearing Jamie Tartt and Roy Kent's signature crowd chants (though it seems doubtful, seeing as how Roy Kent's chant would probably bump the ESRB rating up to M for Mature).\nRegardless of that fact, you can play matches at AFC Richmond's home ground, Nelson Road, and even take control of Coach Lasso or AFC Richmond through Career Mode. AFC Richmond is also playable in Kick-Off, Online Friendlies, and Online Seasons. FIFA 23 Ultimate Team is also adding several AFC Richmond customization items, including kits, TIFOs, and the option to select Ted Lasso or Coach Beard as your FUT club's manager. All the AFC Richmond content in FUT will be obtainable through objectives and challenges.\nYou can see Ted Lasso and the AFC Richmond squad in action through the trailer below.\n\n\nFIFA 23 arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4. Xbox One, PC, and Stadia on September 30.",

Through the video, the publisher reveals the full fighter roster at launch, featuring a good mix of fresh faces and familiar foes.\nThe launch lineup of fighters includes 18 characters to choose from.

Honda\nGuile\nJamie\nJP\nJuri\nKen\nKimberly\nLily\nLuke\nManon\nMarisa\nRyu\nZangief\n\n\nMany of these fighters made their first appearances in Street Fighter (Ken and Ryu) or Street Fighter II (Blanka, Cammy, Chun-Li, Dee Jay, Dhalsim, E.

Although Capcom just pulled the curtain back on the next batch of fighters to join the roster, my demo included the first playable sessions for the last trio of reveals: Guile, Juri, and newcomer Kimberly. Since Kimberly was the wildcard of that bunch, I opted to spend most of my hands-on time discovering what she brings to the table. After only a few rounds, I had a tough time wanting to switch to anyone else.\nIf you haven’t been keeping up, Kimberly is a ninja pupil of Guy who adores the ‘80s and graffiti.

Given the latter game’s events and the tantalizing trailer for its second part, Rebirth, it had me thinking that it may be a good time to dust off my copy of 2008’s Crisis Core. Square Enix read my mind by announcing a remaster of Zack Fair’s PSP adventure, christening it with the subtitle “Reunion,” giving newcomers the answer to the question of “who the heck was that black-haired fella in Remake?” As for me, I thought I had a good reason to return to the game. After playing a decent chunk of Reunion at Tokyo Game Show, I’m all good. \nMy expectations were always reasonable. Reunion is a remaster, not a remake the scale of, well, Remake.

          "description": "Let me fill you in on a little secret most people won't tell you: the real way to enjoy a video game show is at home, comfortably on your couch, watching the event on YouTube. \nOver the years, the game press has done a remarkable job tricking you into thinking otherwise. The shows look extravagant, energetic, and almost like we're getting glimpses into the future, which we then curate into bite-sized news stories and on-demand trailers for our faithful readers back home. \nThe reality is much more depressing.\nWhether it's E3, PAX, Gamescom, or in this case, Tokyo Game Show, going to a video game trade event means dealing with the near-lethal combination of jetlag and overwork. The brutal FOMO of being in some of the coolest cities in the world but spending all your time in convention halls. The unbelievable cacophony of thousands of people talking at once. The unbelievable smells of thousands of people all standing too close to each other. The never-ending lines of thousands of people all needing to use the toilet at the same time. This doesn't even touch on the unavoidable safety concerns of having a video game conference in the midst of an ongoing pandemic. But I digress.\nAll that said, there's some fun stuff to look at, like big, gaudy statues and giant booths that likely cost tens of thousands of dollars for games you've never heard of and likely will never play. Stuff that really makes it all worth it. \nWhile we'd love to fly each and every one of you out to Tokyo, sadly, we only had the budget to fly out two of our full-time employees. So in lieu of attending yourself, please enjoy my curated batch of pictures of what I saw on the show floor. \nWell, there you have it, folks. All the fun of TGS without actually being there. See you next year!",

Each of the game's four playable characters must utilize their unique abilities and confront their own personal revelations in order to expose the secrets haunting the town and ultimately escape their doom.\"\nHere are some additional Saturnalia highlights from Santa Ragione: \nSeek clues in a maze-like village with no markers or compass to guide your steps.\nExplore the ever-changing town of Gravoi using matches to keep the dark at bay.\nFlight and stealth are your only options, as you cannot fight the creature that hunts you.\nImmerse yourself in the stop-motion animation and vibrant expressionist art style of Saturnalia for an eerily beautiful atmosphere that is as enthralling as it is chilling.\nControl your fate through non-linear progression and a dynamic, adaptive narrative, with unique endgames dependent on player choices.\n\n\nSaturnalia hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC via the Epic Games Store on October 27. \nAre you going to check this game out?

The best news: they're out on Steam today.\nJudgment and Lost Judgment come to Steam on September 14. This marks the first appearance of each game on PC (though Judgment has been available to stream on PC via Stadia). \nThis news is especially significant given that RGG Studio originally planned to release Lost Judgment on PC when it launched last year. However, that version was nixed when the talent agency representing actor Takuya Kimura, who portrays protagonist Takayuki Yagami, enforced strict policies about allowing Kimura’s likeness on PC. Both parties' inability to agree threatened Judgment’s future as a franchise since RGG Studio has pushed for more of its titles to come to Steam; every mainline Yakuza game is available on the storefront, for example. It would appear those issues have been ironed out, which bodes well for the potential of a third game. \nThe Judgment games are noir action thrillers that adhere to the same open-world design template as the Yakuza series. Though the plots largely unfold in Kamurocho, the series stars a new cast of characters and emphasizes investigative gameplay. Players control Yagami, a disgraced lawyer and private detective who works to unravel a pair of conspiracy plots. In Yakuza fashion, he also has his hands full helping his colorful clients and random citizens solve more light-hearted – or comically absurd – problems. \nTo learn more about each title, you can read our reviews for Judgment here and Lost Judgment here.",

The video showcased otherworldly imagery, including astral jellyfish, giant dinosaur-like creatures, and notably, a pivotal scene wherein Atreus appears to usher in Fimbulwinter, the end of the world, alongside Sköll and Hati – two wolves that are the offspring of Fenrir. According to Norse mythology, Sköll and Hati are two wolves who exist to one day spark the beginning of Ragnarök by chasing and devouring the sun and the moon. It’s pretty clear that’s what is happening in this new trailer, but why is Atreus helping them?\nAdditionally, it seems Atreus is hiding critical information from his father, Kratos, so why is Kratos following orders from his teenage son? Why is Freya holding a sword up to Atreus’ throat in the trailer? Is she holding Atreus hostage or trying to show Kratos the same pain she suffered after her son Baldur was killed in the first game? The trailer creates more questions than answers, precisely what I want from pre-launch marketing. \n\n\nWe’ll have to wait to find the answers to these questions when God Of War Ragnarök releases on November 8.

It's not quite clear if it's taking up the Soulslike mantle that other Team Ninja games have (looking at you, Nioh), but there were a few gameplay sequences that showed some combat similar to From Software's hit series. \nCheck it out for yourself in the reveal trailer below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Rise of the Ronin looks quite interesting. The combat looks fast, brutal, and explosive, and the characters look fun. The world looks especially unique, too, with some of the game seemingly taking place in more rural areas of Japan and others taking place in more dense villages and towns.\n\nUnfortunately, it might be a while before we learn more because Rise of the Ronin won't hit PlayStation 5 until 2024. \nAre you excited for Rise of Ronin?

It began with a few shots to set up the scenery before cutting to two series mainstays, Kazuya and Kazuya's son, Jin. The two duke it out in what appears to be a fair fight, that is until Kazuya calls forth the power of the devil gene inside him to finish the fight. \nCheck it out for yourself in the reveal trailer below:\n\n\nUnfortunately, this trailer doesn't reveal much else.

          "description": "As one of the most influential and beloved shooters of all time, GoldenEye 007 is a special game for many who played it in the late '90s. However, it's been a long time since the game has been playable on modern consoles. That changes soon, as the revolutionary first-person shooter received a duo of announcements today. First, we learned about a Switch version as part of the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack N64 catalog. However, we also learned the title (which was developed by now-Microsoft-owned Rare), is also coming to Xbox as a part of Game Pass and Rare Replay.\nWhen the game arrives on Xbox, it will include the classic campaign, complete with the original difficulty settings and cheat codes (no word on if \"DK Mode\" will be renamed to something more generic like \"Big Head Mode\" for the Xbox version). The Xbox version will also include the split-screen local competitive multiplayer mode that made the game such a mainstay for get-togethers in the N64 era.\n\n\nUnfortunately, it does not appear as though the online multiplayer available in the Nintendo Switch Online version will make the jump to the Xbox version. However, the Xbox version of GoldenEye 007 does include improved control options (including dual analog stick support), native 16:9 resolution up to 4K Ultra HD, a consistent refresh rate, and full achievement support. \nGoldenEye 007 is coming to Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One as part of Game Pass. Everyone who already owns Rare Replay will also be able to download the game at no additional cost. We don't know exactly when GoldenEye 007 arrives on Xbox, but according to Rare, the game will land simultaneously on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch Online.",

With two of the six promised waves of new courses already out, Nintendo has begun teasing what players can expect with the third wave, which is due out this holiday season. During today's Nintendo Direct, we learned the first two courses coming in the third eight-course wave of new tracks.\nFittingly, the first course we learned about for Wave 3 of the Booster Course Pass is Merry Mountain. This holiday-themed track first made its debut in Mario Kart Tour in 2020 as part of the Winter Tour. Meanwhile, for those looking for something not holiday-themed, Nintendo is also bringing Peach Gardens, a track that first appeared in Mario Kart DS in 2005.\nWave 1 brought fan favorites like Coconut Mall (Wii), Choco Mountain (N64), and Sky Garden (GBA), while Wave 2 gave us access to tracks like Kalimari Desert (N64), Mario Circuit 3 (SNES), and Mushroom Gorge (Wii). Each wave has also given us two tracks from Mario Kart Tour, with Wave 2 also including an all-new course in Sky-High Sundae. \nMario Kart 8 Deluxe – Booster Course Pass Wave 3 is scheduled to arrive this holiday season.",

The first free update, which came out earlier this summer, added the ability to use the leg strap accessory for entire soccer matches instead of just shootouts. The second, more anticipated free update is set to add a new playable sport to the package: golf. Originally set for release this fall, Nintendo today announced a small delay to the update, saying it now arrives this holiday season.\nThe Nintendo Switch Sports version of golf lets you tee up across 21 holes carried over from the Wii Sports series. You can play locally with other players or hit the links with up to eight players online in the new Survival Golf mode.

Fae Farm is a cozy life simulation that whisks players to a world of magic and wonder where you'll flex your green thumb as a farming savior. \n\n\nAs the name suggests, the bulk of the experience involves running a farm as an adventurer and newcomer to a community in the land of Azoria. Though you’ll work to bring peace to this troubled land, you’ll also kick back and leisurely explore various environments, collect resources, and build homesteads. Fae Farm is built with cooperation in mind. The title features drop-in/drop-out co-op, both locally and online, allowing players to farm and quest together. \n“With Fae Farm we wanted to take our favorite elements of the sim genres we love, infuse them with magic and beautiful art, and wrap everything in a light-hearted cooperative experience,” said creative director Katie De Sousa in a press release. “I can’t wait to see what kind of cozy homesteads players build in Azoria.”\nFae Farm is slated to release during Q2 2023 exclusively for Switch.",

Where could they be? More details about this new title for Nintendo Switch will be revealed ahead of its 2023 launch.\"\n\n \nPikmin is a very special franchise to many people, but despite its niche popularity, it's never quite reached the heights of other Nintendo franchises. In total, the franchise has sold more than 8 million copies. Pikmin 3 Deluxe on Switch proved the franchise still had some (fruit) juice in it by selling roughly 2 million units in less than a year – a quarter of the series' entire sales – and fans speculated this had proved to Nintendo that it was time for a proper sequel. \nPikmin 4 was mentioned by series creator Shigeru Miyamoto back in 2015 when he told Eurogamer that it was in development and \"very close to completion.\" Time passed and then Hey! Pikmin, a 2D Pikmin spinoff, was announced and then released in July of 2017. Some speculated that this was the Pikmin 4 Miyamoto was referring to back in 2015 but in June of that year, Miyamoto told Eurogamer that \"it is progressing,\" seemingly confirming that he did not view Hey! Pikmin as the fourth sequel. Unfortunately, that was the last Nintendo or anyone there referred to Pikmin 4...until today's Nintendo Direct!\n\nNintendo showcased a short and sweet teaser trailer that gave us more of the luscious world of Pikmin before flashing to a title screen that revealed Pikmin 4 is coming to Switch next year. As for exactly when, that remains unknown  – Nintendo simply stated 2023. But hey, that's better than wondering when, if ever, Pikmin 4 would actually come out! \nAre you excited for Pikmin 4?
