          "description": "In the Summer skies, flying high!\nDid you know the F-16 first took flight 50 years ago a few months back? It is currently enjoying its Block 70 revision in case you were fearing that air forces around the world are still flying half-century-old technology. Meanwhile, Ace Combat is turning 30 next year and, much like an airplane block revision, it evolves with every new entry. Sadly Nintendo owners might have missed this evolution entirely, with only a Game Boy Advance entry and two slightly different 3DS versions of an Ace Combat 2 remake successfully navigating to Nintendo skies. Sadly, the 3DS game carries in the West the title of Assault Horizon Legacy (+), which ended up confusing potential young nuggets to take the plunge since the home console Assault Horizon remains the most devise entry in the series, with developer Project Aces attempting to inject some Call of Duty-ism into the formula with disastrous results.\nThe pressure was on. The Xbox 360-exclusive Ace Combat 6: Fires of Liberation had raised the bar for the series (which was already extremely high after the PlayStation 2 trilogy), so Project Aces needed to ensure that the next numbered game in the series was their shiniest, slickest F-16 equivalent yet. In January 2019, Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown launched on previous-generation consoles and soon after on PC to warm reviews. Five years later, this very same Unreal Engine-powered opus now lands on Nintendo Switch, which is something none of us at Nintendo Life ever expected to write. Surely, there has to be a catch... right?\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Who knew a Gossip Stone could be so useful?\nIf you cast your mind back to earlier this year, you might recall an Ocarina of Time mod from notCHase which added Tears of the Kingdom's Ultrahand ability to Link's 1998 adventure. It was an entertaining watch and, after watching a polygonal Hero of Time put together a few rudimentary builds, we couldn't help but wonder what his other Zonai abilities might look like in the iconic N64 style. Well, we have our answer (thanks, Gaming Reinvented).\nModder notCHase is back with a new build, this time adding TOTK's Fuse to Ocarina of Time (at least, to the game's open-source port, Ship of Harkinian). It's just as wild to see as you might expect. In the brief demo of the mod shown above, notCHase demonstrates Link's combining abilities in action, fusing signs, trees, enemies and even NPCs to his sword and shield.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The room-based gameplay, upgrade and power-up systems, approach to storytelling, and hack-and-slash combat will be no stranger to those who have played the award-winning god-like roguelike. But this is no bad thing. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, after all, and Splintered Fate throws it out like shuriken in this run-based romp out of the underworld sewers.\nHowever, the comparisons to Supergiant's critical darling are a double-edged sword. On the one hand, Splintered Fate is Hades, and anyone who enjoyed evading the wrath of the God of the Underworld will find much to enjoy here; on the other, this is not Hades and the inevitable comparisons that it draws with combat, performance, and visuals may be its biggest shell kicking.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

At the time of writing, this is only available on PS5 and Xbox Series, but, as noted by Twitter user @TezFunz2, the Switch was briefly mentioned in the list of 'Games Included With GTA+', leading to speculation about whether the subscription would expand to more consoles in the near future.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Besides, let’s face it, on the odd occasion the Switch has received a port of a racing sim, the results usually leave something to be desired – case in point, the chonky visuals that were being churned out in the WRC games for years.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

From exams to social drama to the occasional run-in with a schoolyard bully, everyone had a bit of a hard time, but spare a thought to the poor headteachers who had to keep a building full of hormonal teenagers from descending into utter chaos. Let’s School from Pathea Games (My Time at Sandrock) gives a nod to these brave individuals and shows just how bogged down in bureaucracy everyone’s headteacher really is. No wonder they always had such a short temper with us.\nThe gameplay of Let’s School isn’t that different from other management sims like Two Point Campus. You inherit a rundown school from your old headteacher and are tasked with helping it achieve greatness once again. However, where Two Point Campus leans into the whimsy of running an educational institute, Let’s School instead focuses on mundane tasks required to keep both students and staff happy.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Prepare to die.\nUpon booting it up for the very first time, Darkest Dungeon 2 greets you with a message that plainly informs you that you’re going to fail… a lot… while trying to overcome its many challenges. It does this not to discourage you, but to set expectations. Keeping with the precedent set by the first Darkest Dungeon, this sequel is the kind of game that doesn’t pull its punches as you work to achieve mastery over its various systems. Many may be put off by developer Red Hook Studios' uncompromising approach to difficulty, but those who stick it out will find that Darkest Dungeon 2 offers some of the most rewarding experiences one can find in a roguelike RPG adventure. Perhaps most importantly, this new entry also isn’t afraid to try some new things that set it noticeably apart from its predecessor.\nGetting its first full release on PC back in May 2023 following 18 months of Early Access, Darkest Dungeon 2 takes place in a grim, Lovecraftian world overrun by all manner of undead creatures and eldritch abominations after an academic named The Scholar messed around with an ancient relic called the Iron Crown. All the horrors stem from a mountain looming ominously in the distance, and you’re thus tasked with assembling a team of four adventurers and using their combat and survival skills to help you carry a flame called Hope aboard a stagecoach to the mountain, where you will confront the source of the evil and hopefully rid the land of it for good.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Provided you’ve got an Amazon Prime account, or at least the free Prime trial, the 512GB model can be yours for £569, a saving of £131. Not bad, for a device with a higher-rez display and more graphical horsepower than the Steam Deck or Steam Deck OLED.\nRead more",

Slimes do take more complex forms - chrome slimes, fire slimes, slimes with angry eyebrows, etc - but come now, it's not on the same level as rebooting Lara Croft's hair to billow in the blowback from grenades.\nThe simplicity of slime creation may soon become a distant memory, however, for Epic Games tech artist and current Duck Shake Games Asher Zhu is hell-bent on reinventing the homely Dragon Quest sludgeball as a technical tour de force on par with his previous contributions to Unreal Engine showcase Matrix Awakens. That's the impression I garner from the below video of Zhu's latest project, anyway, whose description also tantalises with talk of \"Splatoon mechanics in dungeons\".\n Read more",

What ensues is a charming puzzler of both freedom and flow, which genuinely has you view everyday environments through the googly eyes of a phantom amphibian.

Best not speculate.\nAnyway, Fallout London is a huge effort from modders Team Folon that was recently sabotaged when Bethesda treated Fallout 4 to a next gen update to capitalise on the Amazon TV show's popularity, rendering several mods incompatible and breaking a lot of stuff. Team Folon have now fiddled with the workings and sent a Fallout London build to GOG for QA testing, which suggests that release is imminent. The catch, however, is that you will need to downgrade your copy of Fallout 4 to play the mod, because even with Team Folon's last-minute adjustments, Fallout 4 next gen and Fallout London simply don't get on.\n Read more",

Like the lootbox hawkers of yesteryear, gacha designers understand the appeal and power of a pleasingly animated gizmo, ker-chunking open and fizzing with potential. This poppy visual and sonic language stretches across Hoyo's latest game, from its cinematic moments, to each character's attacks, to the cute bunny mascots that erupt into gatling guns, to the barista's coffee-making ritual and the recipes of the robo-limbed noodle server. The menu screens, the maps, the free-to-play storefront, everything. It is all very juicy. It is pumped with juice, but only in the same way supermarket chicken is pumped with water. \nRead more",

          "description": "The studio-killing fallout of Embracer's acquisition frenzy continues to fall like ash on the industry. The publishing giant has reportedly closed Piranha Bytes, the studio known for cult RPGs like Gothic, Risen, and Elex, according to a worker who spoke to Polish games site CD-Action. The studio's existence had been under threat since early this year, after being targeted in Embracer's purgatorial studio massacre. At that time the German studio were hopeful to avoid being closed down, insisting \"don't write us off yet!\" Unfortunately, it looks like those who worked at the studio have since been laid off.\nRead more",

          "description": "I gaze with alarm and approval upon the recent phenomenon of \"dark strategy\" or \"horror strategy\" games, a devilish parade of top-down drag-clickers, from The Fabulous Fear Machine to The Tribe Must Survive, that strive to find the fear in a genre that typically places you at a managerial remove. The best-known is probably Frostpunk, with its perpetual raging against the dying of the light, its ceaseless scrape for coal and wood as the temperature falls. Anoxia Station, announced this month, is similarly driven by the gathering of fossil fuels, and similarly shaped by questions of worker death and morale, but it takes you deep underground - into a sumptuous, brutal world of quartz crystals, salt caves, magma lakes, moonmilk rivers, swirling gases and, judging from the below trailer, enormous maggots and centipedes. Larva lakes, amirite.\n Read more",

It has now been occupied by Russia for almost two years, during which, as reported by the Associated Press, Russia has demolished, rebuilt and renamed much of the city, overwriting its Ukrainian heritage.\nThe Disco Elysium-inspired RPG Hollow Home is a memory of Mariupol from just before the war - not a 1:1 recreation, but a collection of details, colours, personalities and some familiar buildings, painstakingly amassed and offered up in the face of erasure. Speaking to me during a very brief demo at Digital Dragons in Poland this year, artist Anastasia Hlyniana called my attention to the plants jutting from old car tyres around the game's isometric map, which she says are a common sight in Mariupol.\n Read more",

The tune you were whistling dies in your throat as you hurry past into the reassuring shadow of the relatively gnomeless bungalows to either side. Gardening sim Horticular is like that, but with an even greater sense of contrast, because it asks you to resettle a desolate planet. There is no generic urban scenery to hurry onto, here.

I have a lot of material, oodles of interviews with developers of all shapes and sizes - big shops like Remedy and CD Projekt, smaller studios like Ace Team and Awaceb, all holding forth on such topics as whether Elden Ring or Zelda did bandit camps better, and how you make a forest feel endless.

At the time of writing, the game sits at just over £20,000, with a comfortable 28 days left on the campaign. \n\n\nThe developer's previous game raised over £25,000 with its campaign, and Heir of the Dog looks set to beat that in no time. The title is inspired by Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson but takes a comical approach to its story. Set in Victorian London, the game follows upper class twit Cummerbund Bandersnatch after he sneaks into his uncle's laboratory and does something nobody should ever do.

Urzikstan map lovers can look forward to this latest feature on July 24, with the possible comeback of the STG-44. \n\n\nThe Atlas Superstore brings forth a new hub where you can gather some much-needed materials. Though, it won't be as easy as checking out a few items at the counter, given that everyone will be gunning for this place. That just means you'll have to use the aisles to your advantage to get through here safely.\n\n\n\n\nIf you look closely at this Warzone Season 5 teaser, you may have noticed the sightings of the classic weapon, STG-44. This Assault Rifle has been a part of almost every CoD iteration, from Black Ops to Advanced Warfare. Although the gun was only shown briefly in the clip, it does seem to match the design from past entries.\n\n\n\n\nThe STG-44 also looks to have a much more modern design to complement the franchise's revamped graphics. It'll be curious to see how it will work in Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone Season 5. I, myself, would like to know if it will have the same submachine gun qualities as it did in the past.\n\n\nOn the other hand, it hasn't been officially confirmed that the STG-44 will make its return. Plus, the weapon in the teaser could be a completely different gun we are unaware of. But since there have been a few leaks floating around its comeback, it does seem plausible.\n\n\nImage via Activision\n\n\nMore content for Warzone and MW3 Season 5 is expected to come soon. There's an upcoming WWE crossover on the horizon with potential new Operator skins. Mark your calendars for this launch on July 24 across all compatible platforms.\n\nThe post Warzone Season 5 teaser reveals new Superstore POI and possible return of STG-44 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Hooded Horse and Minakata Dynamics (developers of Railgrade) have announced Whiskerwood, a new settlement game with a focus on automation. Visually, it’s very evocative about the survival settlement sensation, Timberborn, but is more focused on automation and production rather than survival.\n\n\nIt’s also about a different creature. While Timberborn was centered around beavers (nature’s engineers), Whiskerwood has you watching over the well-being of mice. These mice, however, live under the thumb of aristocratic felines. Fat cats, if you will. Aristocats. The cats have demands that must be met, so your task is to gather resources from the environments and process them for export.\n\n\nVia PC Gamer\n\n\nThe block-based building system and, indeed, many of the buildings themselves look very similar to Timberborn, but that game was about helping your beavers survive droughts. There wasn’t very much in the way of trade and economy, which is where Whiskerwood diverges significantly.\n\n\nIt’s looking very feature-dense. There are forty commodities to produce, conveyor belts and elevators to move them, and various mousey needs like healthcare and heating. The main challenge, as stated by the store page, is to strike a perfect balance between the needs of the mouse and the demands of the cat. There is also a naval aspect, as you can explore other islands and battle at sea. I thought this might be menu-based, but the press release says, \"turn-based combat using ships of war.\" Radical.\n\n\nI think it looks terrific, but then, I do love Timberborn. The promised depth in Whiskerwood just looks so focused and well-planned. I’ll be keeping an eye on this one.\n\n\nWhiskerwood will first be released into PC Early Access on Steam. No release window has been stated.\n\nThe post Whiskerwood is like Timberborn, if it let you build an adorable sweatshop appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The next action-RPG from developer FuRyu is Reynatis, which is currently set to launch around the world on September 27, 2024. Those looking forward to it will have plenty to dig into beyond the full game itself, because nine free updates are planned for post-launch release.\n\n\nNIS America shared some vague details along with the announcement. According to the press release, Reynatis players can look forward to a \"secret episode,\" as well as new story episodes for lead characters Marin Kirizumi and Sari Nishijima. Aside from that, all we know is we can expect \"more action, magical clashes, and additional story insights.\" \n\n\nA handful of new screenshots debuted with the news, and NIS America promises more information on free updates in the future.\n\n\nScreenshot via NIS America\n\n\nSet against the backdrop of a magic-infused depiction of Tokyo, Reynatis follows a wizard named Marin as he runs into Sari in Shibuya. Sari is an officer of the M.E.A., an organization tasked with regulating magic and reining in wizards. Magic killed Sari's sister, thrusting her into the magic enforcement role. Meanwhile, Marin seeks liberation and additional power. Sounds like a recipe for clashing personalities and motives, if you ask me. \n\n\nThese story beats work their way into the game's exploration and combat system. In Suppression Mode, Marin can hide his identity and explore freely. Switching to Liberation Mode on the fly lets Marin unleash his powerful magic for some cinematic action. Doing so, however, also attracts the attention of the M.E.A. \n\n\nScreenshot via NIS America\n\n\nWe'll have to wait until closer to launch to find out how that story dynamic expands with the nine updates planned so far. When Reynatis arrives, it'll be available on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC. \n\nThe post FuRyu action-RPG Reynatis has nine free updates planned post-launch appeared first on Destructoid.",

For many this is a huge part of the fun: playing a game with history, and decks that reflect that as time-honed strategies rise to the top and dominate for years.\n\n\nStill, not everyone is interested in the usually glacial change of metas that playing with all, or even just the most recent 70% of cards, provides. For these players, Standard is king. This game mode usually encompasses cards that have been released within the past 2 years, give or take two or three sets.\n\n\nHowever, even this is about to change with the release of Foundations.

          "description": "Dead by Daylight’s 8th-anniversary stream revealed a few big updates for the popular asymmetrical horror game. The most immediate is the addition of Lara Croft as the game’s latest crossover survivor along with the impending addition of the much-requested 2v8 mode. \nTomb Raider Chapter\nLara Croft (the 2013 reboot version, specifically) joins DBD today, and though she lacks her pistols and bow, she sports three new perks highlighting her adventuring prowess. Here's an explanation of each per DBD's website:\nFinesse: Your fast vaults are faster when healthy, with a cooldown after a successful use.\nHardened: When you open a Chest and cleanse or bless a Totem, Hardened activates for the duration of the Trial. From that point, every time you scream, you’ll instead reveal the Killer’s Aura.\nSpecialist: When you open or rummage through a Chest, gain 1 Token (up to 3). When you do a Great Skill Check, consume a Token to reduce the max required Generator progress.\n\n\n2v8 Mode\nOn July 25, a new 2v8 multiplayer mode descends into the game. This pits two Killers against eight survivors in expanded versions of five classic maps. The number of generators has been doubled, and Survivors must now repair 8 out of 13 to escape. Captive Survivors are now sent directly into cages, and Survivor perks have been reworked into a new role system designed to encourage teamwork. \n\n\nCross-Progression\nCross-progression is being implemented on July 22. This means players can now sync their progress across multiple owned versions of the game. Everything can be shared across any platform except for Switch, which has a few restrictions as you can see in the chart below. \nToday’s stream also revealed a new trailer and the release date for The Casting of Frank Stone, the single-player DBD game developed by Supermassive Games (Until Dawn, The Quarry). You can read all about that here.",

          "description": "The Casting of Frank Stone, Supermassive Games’ single-player narrative-driven horror game set in the Dead by Daylight universe, has a release date. This intriguing horror collaboration will arrive on September 3, and a new trailer provides a proper introduction of the main cast. \nDeveloped by Supermassive (Until Dawn, The Quarry) and published by Dead by Daylight developer Behaviour Interactive, The Casting of Frank Stone stars five teenagers – Christine Gordon, Jaime Rivera, Linda Castle, Robert Green, and Bonnie Rivera – who film their own horror movie in an abandoned steel mill. Unfortunately, this mill has ties to a notorious murderer named Frank Stone, and the youth’s innocent art project goes horribly wrong.\n\n\nWe still don’t know much about the narrative other than that it is set within the world of Dead by Daylight and takes place in the town of Cedar Mills during the summer of 1980. Gameplay-wise, The Casting of Frank Stone follows a similar blueprint to Supermassive’s previous horror titles in that it’s a choice-driven adventure where characters can be permanently killed off based on your decisions. You can check out a recent gameplay trailer here to see it in action. \nThe Casting of Frank Stone is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

As such, those companions are key to everything happening in Veilguard. \nWith such a significant emphasis on these characters, I spoke to some of the game's leads to learn precisely about BioWare's philosophy on companions in Veilguard. \n\n\n\"No, that is the case,\" BioWare general manager Gary McKay tells me when I ask if he agrees with the stumbled-onto-greatness sentiment. \"I would first …",

          "description": "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed, the video game follow-up to last year’s TMNT: Mutant Mayhem animated film, has its first trailer and a release date. The game was first announced last September. \nA Heartful of Games is developing the game, which retains the stylized Spider-Verse-inspired art direction from the hit film. The story unfolds after the movie's events and sees Leo, Raph, Donny, and Mikey battling a new wave of mutants invading New York City. \n\n\nAs previously covered in our exclusive preview earlier this year, Mutant Mayhem is a third-person action/platformer game, and each turtle features a unique playstyle. The game also supports up to two-player local co-op. \nTMNT: Mutants Unleashed launches on October 18 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. The game is also getting a fancy Collector Edition, and you can see the contents of that here. Mutants Unleashed is one of several TMNT games to arrive in recent years (and the third in 2024 alone, following Wrath of the Mutants and the Switch port of Splintered Fate), and you can read all about the franchise’s history in video games in our in-depth retrospective.",

          "description": "Mortal Kombat 1’s final Year 1 DLC fighter arrives next week, and it’s Takeda Takahashi. The young Shirai Ryu warrior makes only his second appearance in a Mortal Kombat game and looks every bit as capable as his older clanmates, Scorpion and Smoke. \nAlthough Takeda was Kenshi’s son in his debut appearance, Mortal Kombat X, the remixed timeline of Mortal Kombt 1 has changed him to Kenshi’s cousin. Like Kenshi, Takeda grew up a Yakuza but was more faithful to the clan than his cousin. As such, the Yakuza tasked Takeda with killing Kenshi, and the two battled, with the latter coming emerging victorious. Takeda was mortally wounded in the battle and rushed to the aid of the Shirai Ryu, where Kenshi protected him from being killed by the Yakuza for failing his mission. This causes Takeda to have a change of heart and join the Shirai Ryu to wage war against Earthrrealm’s criminal underground and, eventually, the evil forces of Outworld. \nTakeda still utilizes the Shirai Ryu fighting style, including his signature pair of bladed whips. He also sports shurikens, a barrage of teleporting flame attacks, and an aerial grapple best described as mid-air corkscrew piledriver. Check Takeda out below.  \n\n\nTakeda will be available on July 23, both as a standalone purchase and as a free download for Kombat Pack owners. The same day also sees previously revealed Kameo fighter Ferra become available to buy. Both Takeda and Ferra will be playable for the first time during Evo 2025 this weekend. \nFor more on Mortal Kombat 1, check out our review as well as the trailers for previous DLC fighters Homelander, Omni-Man, Ermac, Peacemaker, and Quan-Chi.",

It was only last year that we played Double Dragon Gaiden, a pixelated throwback brawler (or belt-scroll action game, per its official YouTube description) take on the franchise.\nThis next entry is decidedly more modern, with fully 3D visuals. It's not the first time the series has explored this dimension, but it is a rare occurrence. The game is being developed by Yuke's, the developer that worked on the WWE 2K franchise until 2K19 and most recently developed AEW: Fight Forever. It is being published, or presented by, as the trailer implies, Arc System Works, the developer behind Guilty Gear and Dragon Ball FighterZ.\nDouble Dragon Revive is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and One, and PC sometime in 2025.\n\n\nFor a whole lot more on Double Dragon, but maybe not the version of Double Dragon you're thinking, head here to read all about the 1994 movie. Back in 2019, I tracked down the film's director, James Yukich, to talk about the bizarre film's trajectory, what went wrong, and what he would have done differently had he been giving a chance to try making the film again.",

And later this year, there will be a handful of price increases for various tiers.

These changes will enable us to bring members more value and more great games to Game Pass.\nThe new Xbox Game Pass Standard tier for new members will be $15 a month and will not include access to Day One releases, EA Play, Game Pass for PC, and cloud gaming.\nXbox Game Pass Ultimate, which includes access to all the bonuses now not included in the Standard tier is increasing its price from $17 a month to $20.\nXbox Game Pass Core, which offers online access and a much smaller library of curated games, is changing its yearly from $60 to $75. The $10 monthly price for that tier, however, will remain unchanged.\nPC Game Pass is increasing from $10 per month to $12, but that tier will still include Day One releases.\nAll of these price changes will be reflected starting on September 12.\nPrice changes for services you already pay for are always frustrating. What do you think of the change? Do you plan on maintaining your subscription? Or is it time to cancel?",

Just within the character creator, there are hundreds of options to customize things like hair, body type, what your playable character Rook's face looks like, and so much more. There are also a ton of armor options, too. \nCompanions have an armor slot, a ring slot, an accessory slot, and a weapon slot, while Rook has access to even more – a helmet, two weapon slots, a belt, an amulet slot, and two ring slots. A belt having its own slot might sound odd as it's not an armor piece people typically think of when kitting out an RPG warrior. However, the belt is an important facet of Rook's kit. The better Rook's belt, the better the potency of their healing potions, which are replenished by destroying green pots scattered about the …",

In the Resident Evil 4 (RE4) VR port, all it takes is lifting the controller in the air at the right time.\nAnd it’s always satisfying.\nThe parry mechanic is one of the novel additions of the 2023 remake developed by Capcom. Whenever a bolt or melee attack from an infected villager is about to impact Leon Kennedy, you only need to press a button to deflect with the in-game knife. This action grants an opportunity to follow up with an attack on the spot while simultaneously adding to RE4’s original close-quarter smackdown.\nAdapting this to the PlayStation VR2 wasn’t easy. Instead of Leon doing a swift animation with just a button press, you need to grab the knife from your chest, lift it up in the air, and match the incoming attack. I…",

In the wake of such a weird cultural moment, I’m certainly not the only one left wondering how the dust settles, especially as it relates to how we meet up, build friendships and relationships, and socialize. If you’re a gamer, answering those questions requires an additional layer of complexity since we spend much of our free time in virtual worlds.

Owners of these games will still be able to play their single-player content, but online support for these titles will end on November 7. The embedded announcement post on X also includes a link to an FAQ to answer additional questions about the sunsetting process. \nhttps://t.co/2W8dLlGjBM\nJune 28, 2024\nWhile the digital PS3/Xbox 360 versions of these games are going away, Battlefield 3 will still be available to purchase on PC. The same is true for Battlefield 4 and Hardline, and these two titles will also remain on sale for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The PC/PS4/Xbox One versions will remain unaffected by today’s updates.\nIt never feels good to see games get removed from sale like this. The reason likely has to do with EA sunsetting online support; it wouldn't be right to continue selling games with popular online modes if that component doesn't work anymore. For those still logging into Battlefield matches on PS3 and 360, you've got a few more months to enjoy the ride.\nFor more on Battlefield, you can learn about how the next entry is shaping up (which is being made with help by Dead Space remake developer Motive Studios) here.",

And it continues to look like a scary new addition to the A Quiet Place movie universe. \nThough there's still no release date – it's launching sometime this year on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC – this story trailer reveals more about the state of the world in The Road Ahead. It seemingly begins on Day One, when the aliens, which possess incredible hearing that requires people to remain silent to survive, attack Earth. It then jumps ahead to Day 105, with Alex, an asthmatic college student trying to survive the end of the world with her boyfriend Martin, on the hunt for supplies and more. \nCheck it out for yourself in the story trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead below: \n\n\nAs you can see, it seems Alex might be pregnant, which, if you've seen the first A Quiet Place movie, can make trying to remain silent in this world quite difficult.

As for why, the team wants to give its spiritual cousin, Life Is Strange: Double Exposure, some space to shine later this year. \nLost Records was originally due out in late 2024, which is also when the next Life is Strange is set to launch. Instead of competing with Life Is Strange, a series that Don't Nod created with the first Life Is Strange and continued with Life Is Strange 2 before Double Exposure developer Deck Nine took over with 2017's Before the Storm and 2021's True Colors, the studio decided to push to 2025. \nWe've made the decision to move the release dates of Lost Records: Bloom & Rage to early 2025. We know you're all excited for both Lost Records and the new Life is Strange game, and we wanted to ensure both have adequate space to shine. The wait will be worth it! pic.twitter.com/PH1O7z3uUy\nJune 28, 2024\nLife Is Strange: Double Exposure launches October 29, and now, Lost Records: Bloom & Rage, which will be released in two parts, will launch sometime early next year. Both games are set to release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. \nIn the meantime, watch the reveal trailer for Lost Records: Bloom & Rage, and then watch the Life Is Strange: Double Exposure reveal trailer.

Despite my expectations, I was not prepared for how robust it actually is in Veilguard. Robust enough, even, that BioWare used it to create most of the NPCs in the game, save for mainline characters like companions. Setting hyperbole aside, it is a staggeringly rich creation system, and I look forward to seeing player-created near-replicas of celebrities and monstrous creations that'd be more at home in a horror game. \nBut I'm also looking forward to the community's reaction to the Dragon Age series' best character creator yet.

Originally slated to launch next month on July 25, the upcoming narrative-driven city-builder is now arriving on September 20.\nDeveloper 11 Bit Studios sates that following a recent beta, the team wants to take extra time addressing feedback to ensure the best possible experience. In a press release, design director Jakub Stokalski and art director Lukasz Juszczyk issued the following statement:\n“Based on the surveys we received after playing Beta, the average rating you gave us was 8 out of 10. We’re super grateful for that! At the same time, it was only a small slice of a work-in-progress, still-growing game. While our backlog is plentiful, it was an opportunity for us to listen to what you enjoyed, and what didn’t quite land yet”. \n“This allowed us to prioritise things better, and bring upfront the features and modifications we were already working on. But we also realised that to guarantee the best possible experience on launch, we need more time to finish the development of Frostpunk 2. That’s why we made the difficult decision to postpone its release to September 20th, 2024”.\n11 Bit States that it plans to work on new additions to existing game mechanics and improve the UI and UX, among other things. \nFrostpunk 2 will launch first for PC on September 20. PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions are planned to arrive later. We recently played the game, and you can read our extensive preview here.",

More specifically, it hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via Steam) on August 1, and it brings with it updated visuals and controls and a new skin that harkens back to the original game's most infamous easter egg. \nIn the reveal trailer, we get a look at the graphical improvements Aspyr has implemented in Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, but the game still retains that 2002 PlayStation 2 and GameCube charm. This re-release follows a limited PlayStation 4 physical run that launched back in 2019. \nCheck out the Star Wars: Bounty Hunter announcement trailer below: \n\n\nIf you're unfamiliar with Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, you play as Jango Fett throughout the story, which itself is a prequel to Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones. \nIn the original game, there was an easter egg message that said, \"Cash in all bounties to play as Boba.\" However, cashing in all bounties did not let you play as Boba. To make good on that original promise from 2002, Aspyr media has included a Boba Fett skin in Star Wars: Bounty Hunters you can use after completing the game's campaign. \nStar Wars: Bounty Hunter hits PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on August 1. \nWhile waiting for its launch, check out this lengthy gameplay demo of Star Wars Outlaws, another mercenary-centric Star Wars game launching this year.
