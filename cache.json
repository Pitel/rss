Even if you’re a bit like me and Metriodvanias aren’t really your thing, the hour-long demo is entirely linear, and messing around with the gunbrella's many, many abilities is more than a good enough reason to have a play, even if you're just mucking around.\nRead more",

It's best described as a relaxing house moving sim but it's also a sort of block-fitting puzzle game. Finding the perfect spot for each item is largely down to your own personal taste, but there are some loose 'room rules' (no, you cannot put your toaster in the bedroom for some midnight cheese toastie action). If you like organising games - A Little To The Left, Sticky Business, Wilmot's Warehouse and the like - then Unpacking is the game for you.\nRead more",

          "description": "On the day of our interview, Exo Rally Championship programmer and composer Rhys Lindsay was preparing for a race on a hostile alien planet, and feeling pretty good about his chances. He spent a full three minutes surveying the pockmarked, potentially lethal landscape from above with a drone, marking the most dangerous terrain in advance and picking out a relatively safe route between the checkpoints. “Alright,” he thought. “I’m going to smash this stage.”\r\n\n\r\nOf course, it’s just as they say: no plan survives contact with unroaded planets wracked by extreme temperatures, meteor showers and atmospheric pressure unlike anything ever experienced on Earth. On the corner of the first checkpoint, Lindsay flipped his rover, snagging the vehicle on a rock that immediately broke his scanning systems and left him driving blind. By the time of our chat, though, he’s laughing. Exo Rally Championship is a racer for those who like to roll with the punches, quite literally - an anecdote generator for players who adore the challenge of preparing for the worst, and then adapting to changing circumstances on the fly.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Players will be able to go head to head with two of the game's four factions - the golden fantasy knights of the Stormcast Eternals and the sneaky green stink lads of the Orruk Kruleboyz - giving us our first taste of how they'll handle in battle, and the kinds of powerplays we'll be making with their respective (and rather handsome) tabletop miniature recreations. \nAnd having played four rounds of its 1v1 matches already at a press event last week, it's quite the thrill - and I say that as someone with no real attachment to Warhammer or Age Of Sigmar's specific lore legacy. The Stormcast Eternals and their flying hammer brutes are just as devastating as you'd imagine, while the lads lads lads and their Killaboss Kruleboyz are challenging late-game bloomers that will give even hardened strategy game veterans plenty to sink their teeth into. Both factions are great fun, and I'm very much looking forward to jumping back in this weekend.\nRead more",

An unassuming first-person puzzler about a puppet fisherman living in a lighthouse, it dazzled with its incredible deployment of VR's unique sense of perspective and scale. It's the kind of game that, if it featured a psychotic AI and some cake memes instead of a beard in a yellow anorak, would have been heralded as a revolution in play.\r\n\n\r\nIt would have been easy to follow-up A Fisherman's Tale in the same way, make a bigger game with a few new gimmicks and a comedy lobster voiced by Stephen Merchant. But that isn't what developer InnerspaceVR has done. Instead, Another Fisherman's Tale bends your neural pathways in entirely new forms, offering a completely different kind of puzzling. The results are equally innovative and almost as interactively satisfying - although a lack of refinement in the latter category is a deflating puncture in the game's dinghy.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Flock is the next game from the makers of Wilmot's Warehouse, Hohokum and I Am Dead, but ever since it was announced last year, I've been wondering about exactly what kind of game it is. The first trailer revealed lots of strange, whimsical environments, equally whimsical-looking beasties and a little person flying around on the back of a giant bird herding them around in delightful swoops and swirls. We also saw some sheep grazing in a meadow before they, too, started to fly alongside your wilder, more abstract animal pals. But the question of what you do in Flock remained unanswered - until last week, when developers Hollow Ponds showed us a little bit more of their creature collecting game during the Annapurna Interactive Showcase stream.\nThere, they revealed that we'll need to collect and charm these creatures to get them to join our respective flocks, and that we'll be able to do so in co-op with a pal. It looks intensely charming, but it still left me with lots of unanswered questions. So I spoke to devs Ricky Haggett and Richard Hogg to find out more. Naturally, there are some things they're not ready to reveal about Flock just yet, but they did tell me that you'll start on top of a mountain and will be wending your way down it with your flock of sheep. \nRead more",

I've thoroughly enjoyed making the team play a tough puzzle game, especially one that's intentionally retro and a bit spooky without being scary. So why not come and join in the discussion? Haha, that's a joke: you don't have a choice. As I said, you're locked in here unless you can find the Resident Evil-ass key I have hidden in here somewhere.

In the meantime, you can check out the 1.2 update called Catacombs which is out right now. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Over a decade on from its Nintendo DS release, there's still nothing quite like Ghost Trick. In this smart murder mystery detective game from the creator of Ace Attorney, you play the recently deceased amnesiac Sissel as he attempts to piece together his own demise. Who killed him? And why? And what's the deal with these newfound powers he has to turn back time and manipulate inanimate objects in his vicinity? That definitely wasn't in the ghostbusting 101 manual. Alas, he doesn't have long to find out, as he'll cross over to the afterlife in the morning. Thus begins a frantic night of whodunnit puzzling at its finest, with director Shu Takumi showing us exactly what he's made of outside the courtroom dramas he built his name on. \nRead more",

While most of the announcements were updates on games we already knew about, there are a couple of cool new things in there that I'm personally quite pumped for, including a new Blade Runner game being developed internally at Annapurna Interactive, a new Keita Takahashi joint about a kid stuck in a T-pose of all things, and a new ghostly biking game from the team behind Nidhogg. I'd highly recommend watching the showcase in full if you can, but in case you need a quick refresher of what happened, or are just short on time, we've rounded up every announcement in order below. \nRead more",

In it, we get to see exactly how its adorable creature herding works in co-op, which you'd probably hope to see, given its own Steam page also describes it as a co-op multiplayer game. But rest assured, Flock is still very much a game you can play on your own, without the need to have a pal along for the ride, the devs tell me. \nRead more",

          "description": "Přestože je právě léto, Virtuální Bastlírna je tu opět jako každý měsíc. Technici a vědci nic jako prázdniny nebo okurkovou sezónu zřejmě neznají! Důkazem budiž, že témat, která strahovské bastlíře tento měsíc zaujala, je více než za květen a červen dohromady. Ze žhavých novinek můžou zmínit nový DAQ nástroj Analog Discovery 3. Ohledně RP 2040 se dělo více věcí - podpora Bluetooth pro RPi Pico W, bootloader startující program z SD karty, BASIC nebo třeba bezdrátovou páječku od MiniWare. Rozhodně ale nelpí na jednom procesoru - Arduino Uno R4 bude v sobě mít ESP32-S3 a vyšlo i nové ESP32-P4.\r\n\r\nZe softwarového světa můžou bastlíři ukázat LoraWAN senzor na odečet vodoměrů s kamerou, jak se hackuje chytrý zubní kartáček, novinky v PrusaSliceru nebo KVM pro desktopy založené na Rpi CM4, opensource kalkulačku s reverzní polskou notací a výpočty nejistot nebo novo verzi KiCADu.\r\n\r\nZa hardware pak strahováci shrnou novinky, které jim přistály v poště - NanoVNA-H4, TinyPFA, TinySA Ultra, generátor pulzů a GPSDO od Leo Bodnara (a opravený SW pro něj). Pak ukázky bastlení - sondy magnetického pole, dokonce několik iterací a jak s nimi hledat problematické zdroje vyzařování a jak se dá postavit Rogowského cívka včetně zesilovače. Možná i ukáží jak minimalizovat rušení z izolovaných měničů, jak minimalizovat šum na napájení nebo jak se krásně měří s DMM6500 od Keithley.\r\n\r\nAť už vás zaujalo cokoliv z nabízených témat nebo chcete ukázat nějaký svůj bastl, dorazte! Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat ve čtvrtek 13. července od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.",

          "description": "Wakanda forever!\nIt looks like the heavily rumored Black Panther game is real. Electronic Arts revealed an all new Seattle-based AAA development studio, Cliffhanger Games, as the developer.\nCliffhanger is led by industry veteran Kevin Stephens, former Studio Head of Monolith Productions. Monolith is best known for Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor and its sequel Shadow of War.\n“We’re dedicated to delivering fans a definitive and authentic Black Panther experience, giving them more agency and control over their narrative than they have ever experienced in a story-driven video game. Wakanda is a rich SuperHero sandbox, and our mission is to develop an epic world for players who love Black Panther and want to explore the world of Wakanda as much as we do,” Kevin said.\nBlack Panther will feature an original story as a third-person single-player game. Cliffhanger will work directly with Marvel Games to ensure Wakanda feels authentic.\nAt this point it seems like every big publisher has a piece of the Marvel pie. Sony has Spider Man while Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montreal recently released Marvel's Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy.\nThis project marks Electronic Arts' first foray into the Marvel universe since Marvel Nesmesis: Rise of the Imperfects released back in 2005. Between Sony's Marvel's Spider Man 2 coming October 20 and this newly revealed Black Panther game, Marvel fans have a lot to look forward to.\nThe post EA reveals Black Panther game developed by new studio appeared first on Destructoid.",

Of course, you remember Fiddlebert from Pikmin, right? For those that don't; Fiddlebert was supposedly Pikmin 1's second captain. He was \"rushed\" since he was just a smaller and green version of Olimar. He would sometimes randomly speak another language and was removed from the Wii and Switch ports of the game...at least, that's what folks on the Pikmin subreddit would have you believe.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Pikmin/comments/14pn5qe/who_the_fuck_is_fiddlebert/\nPikmin fans are currently debating the existence of the green character. Some claim they certainly remember him from the original Pikmin. But let's be honest here. Fiddlebert is as real as Curious George's tail, Oscar Meyer, and the Monopoly Man's monocle. You know, as real as the cornucopia in the Fruit of the Loom logo.\n[caption id=\"attachment_390706\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Nat on Cohost[/caption]\nDo you \"remember\" Fiddlebert?\nThe creation of Fiddlebert is what happens when a dedicated fan base gets together and wants to pass the time before a highly anticipated game release. We saw a similar situation in the Diablo 4 community. It's honestly great! You have a large group of people all excited for Pikmin 4 and willing to take something silly and run with it. Why you might ask? Because it's fun, it's entertaining, and most importantly it's more Pikmin.\nLook, I know the Mandela effect is a real thing. I mean at this point who can argue it? But I have to admit, I don't remember Fiddlebert ever existing. Maybe I just didn't play Pikmin as much as I remember, but surely I'd recognize this green Olimar, right?\nPikmin 4 releases on Nintendo Switch on July 21. I'm willing to bet Fiddlebert will not make an appearance.\nThe post Who is Pikmin’s “Fiddlebert?” An investigation appeared first on Destructoid.",

The company was previously shoveling coal into the crypto furnace; licensing blockchain games, and creating NFTs based on its properties.\nSega hasn’t canceled all of its crypto plans, but we’re watching in real time as the corporation realizes its mistake. Bloomberg reports that Sega “will withhold its biggest franchises from third-party blockchain gaming projects to avoid devaluing its content.” “We’re looking into whether this technology is really going to take off in this industry, after all,” co-Chief Operating Officer Shuji Utsumi told Bloomberg News. Sega will apparently be pulling back from play-to-earn games and is reassessing its Web3 approach to the company's big-budget online multiplayer-focused so-called “super games” that are planned to start releasing in 2026.\nThis, of course, is all in response to the ongoing decline in the crypto market that some have dubbed the \"Crypto Winter.\" The unfortunate part of this is that it’s largely a case of big executives and billionaires buying into an obvious scam, and many of them won’t really see any consequences for the poor decision-making. Instead, it's the people below them that will get the brunt of it. Meta laid off 10,000 employees when it became apparent that the Metaverse was a Web3 black hole that it was dropping money into.

This is a brand-new psychological horror game from Keiichirō Toyama, better known as the creator of the first Silent Hill.\nIn this latest video, the developer gives a brief behind-the-scenes look at the tests that have been done on an early build of Slitterhead. In the footage, we are treated to a few details about the work done so far, which includes some brief glimpses from the game (keep in mind that it's still very much in early development).\nhttps://youtu.be/XYrOO0SLUAI\nAs well as this sneak peek of the project, we're also told that the game will feature \"unique mechanics,\" which have apparently gone down quite well with testers so far.

He also brought onboard Junya Okura and Kazunobu Sato, both of whom he worked with on the cult horror series Siren. Slitterhead will be the new team's maiden release.\nRight now is an exciting time to be a horror fan. Whether it's remakes of classics or...well, okay, there are a lot of remakes at the moment. But the ones that have come about over the last few years have been pretty good.\nThere are also some great games on the indie scene, such as Iron Lung, not to mention the new Amnesia game has been scaring the pants off people.

In the summary document (as spotted by GamesRadar), a question is asked about whether the company will be \"providing high-end visual remakes of only the main numbered entries in the Resident Evil series?\"\n[caption id=\"attachment_390647\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\"] Image via Nintendo.[/caption]\nThe answer is a resounding...well, it's h…",

The official Nintendo customer service Twitter account is now warning people not to blow into their Switch console in any attempt to fix any issues. More specifically, it doesn't want you to utilize your own spittle in order to clear out any dust that may be lurking in the cartridge slot.\nA tweet from the company says the area in which you insert your Switch game \"has a terminal\" which is used to read the said game. It then goes on to say that one should not clean this area out with a cotton swab, nor should a cartridge that's damaged be inserted, lest it corrupts the terminal inside the machine.

          "description": "Obligatory \"Barf!\"\nArc System Works has announced that the 2016 3DS title, River City: Rival Showdown. is coming to PC, Switch, and PlayStation platforms.\nRiver City: Rival Showdown was the second Kunio-Kun/Downtown/Nekketsu/River City title to be released on the 3DS, following River City: Tokyo Rumble in 2013. Both were similar titles that take the Kunio-Kun/Downtown/Nekketsu/River City beat-’em-up formula started in 1986’s Nekketsu Kōha Kunio-kun/Renegade and cemented in 1989’s Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari/River City Ransom. Chubby arms, pained expressions, and lots of smacking take center stage in these games.\nhttps://youtu.be/-DMyaNUrF4o\nThe new port of River City: Rival Showdown will include all the features of the 3DS version but will also include a brand new prequel story called Cold-Blooded Hardcore Yamada-kun. Beyond that, there will also be spiffier graphics and some quality-of-life improvements.\nI’d call myself a huge fan of the Kunio-Kun/Downtown/Nekketsu/River City games, but I’ve had trouble getting myself into the more modern titles. I own River City: Rival Showdown on 3DS. I just couldn’t tell you why I haven’t played more than a few minutes of it.\nOh, wait, yes, I can. It was a horrible time in my life. I wish I hadn’t remembered that.\nIn any case, I’ll hopefully be giving this one another chance. If you haven’t already, you should definitely check out Double Dragon & Kunio-kun: Retro Brawler Bundle. It has all the Famicom games in the Kunio-Kun/Downtown/Nekketsu/River City series, but they’ve gone the extra mile and localized all the ones that were previously Japan-only. Seriously, an impressive effort.\nRiver City: Rival Showdown will be releasing on PC, Switch, and PlayStation on October 12, 2023.\nThe post River City: Rival Showdown is coming to new platforms appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Are you there, God?\nCrate Entertainment has revealed what it has in store for the August update of their Early Access survival city-builder, Farthest Frontier. The headline feature here is a new religion system, but it also promises paper industry and guild halls.\nFarthest Frontier is coming up on a year in early access. It’s a “colony sim” or a “survival city builder.” This burgeoning sub-genre has followed in the wake of the success of 2014’s Banished. It seems a lot of developers felt tired of waiting for a sequel to Banished and have decided to create their own sequels, each tying in a different twist. The base is that you need to focus on the survival of your settlers, but from there, the concept has gone in some interesting directions.\nI’ve actually played Farthest Frontier, and while it’s not as big of a twist as Timberborn’s beaver people, it’s definitely a solid game, even in its current state. It’s detailed, pretty, and has that nice mix of relaxing and stressful.\nHowever, there’s room to expand, and religion sounds like it will be a great addition. Nothing livens up a peasant’s sad existence quite like the fear of an unhappy deity. The central mechanic of religion is finding relics that will “inspire reverence” and provide your people with perks. Personally, I prefer a good sacrifice, but this sounds good too.\nThere is also the introduction of the paper industry, which will allow you to create books; a luxury item for your settlers. There are also guild halls that will boost a chosen industry in your settlement, allowing you to pick your focus. In the future, Crate Entertainment is teasing tweaks to combat, quality of life, mods, and the addition of new livestock. Hopefully ducks.\nFarthest Frontier is currently available on PC via Early Access. The update is planned for release in August.\nThe post Farthest Frontier shows off its big August update appeared first on Destructoid.",

Today's new trailer for Mortal Kombat 1 reveals both Rain and Smoke will appear in the new entry.\nSmoke is a well-liked member of the Lin Kuei, who finally gets a human re-debut in Liu Kang's new era. Here, Smoke is a fellow member of the Lin Kuei who joins with Scorpion and Sub-Zero to defend Earthrealm.\nAlso arriving is Rain, a High Mage of Outworld who wields water magic. He's looking a bit more robed and wizard-like, compared to his original palette-swapped appearance.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66opZ1Go_ZA\nSome Kameo fighters also make an appearance here, too. Scorpion pops up, of course. But the cyborg side of the Lin Kuei appears, too; Sektor and Cyrax are in as Kameos, as well as a human version of Frost.\nFor our two main roster fighters, both look pretty excellent. Smoke is obviously a highlight. His teleportation and quick jabs look fantastic, and that knife looks devastating in the X-ray attacks. Rain, meanwhile, is like a Waterbender that gets to actually do some damage with their aquatic magic. I really dig the big lightning ball attack that he can call down from a raincloud.\nKombat history\nThe Kameo fighters bring their own flavor too, and it's nice to see the cyborgs appear. I was curious about whether they would. With a new era and re-envisioned versions of characters, having the robo-fighters reappear or not felt up in the air.\nAfter playing it at SGF 2023, though, it definitely seemed like Kameos are NetherRealm's way of including more fan-favorites from its ever-expanding universe without having to make them fully fledged fighters right away. If it keeps up the nostalgia and klassic references, I could see this being a really enjoyable experience for long-time MK fans.\nMortal Kombat 1 arrives on September 19, 2023.\nThe post Mortal Kombat 1 trailer unleashes Smoke, Rain, and more Kameos appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "EA Sports UFC 5 has been officially announced by Electronic Arts. The fifth iteration was long-presumed to be in-development, but during the UFC's tentpole International Fight Week event over the weekend, EA Sports and the UFC made it official. While no additional details were revealed outside of the logo, we know that a full reveal is coming in September of this year.\nEA Sports UFC 5 marks the longest gap between entries since the series' introduction. Since the first EA Sports UFC game arrived in 2014, the games have arrived every two years, with UFC 2 arriving in 2016, UFC 3 in 2018, and UFC 4 in 2020. The series has traditionally been developed by EA Vancouver, so that's the expectation with this entry as well, but no official confirmation has been provided by EA one way or the other on that front. EA Sports UFC 5 will also mark the first game in the series to launch since the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S hit the market, so we might be able to expect a leap forward in terms of graphical fidelity and/or performance.\nEA Sports UFC 4 launched on August 14, 2020, and introduced various customization options, as well as new grappling and takedown physics, plus a more fleshed-out single-player career mode. EA Sports has also continually updated the game's roster, adding tens of new fighters to the game in the time since its launch, with the most recent free update featuring Jack Della Maddalena, Erin Blanchfield, and Brandon Royval arriving just last week. For more on our thoughts on EA Sports UFC 4, check out our review here.\nWe'll learn more about EA Sports UFC 5 in September, but in the meantime, what do you hope is fixed, improved upon, or included in the next game? Let your thoughts be known in the comments below!",

          "description": "EA has announced that a Black Panther game is in the works. The title is being made by Cliffhanger Games, a new triple-A studio based in Seattle, in collaboration with Marvel Games.\nThe upcoming title is billed as a single-player story-driven third-person action-adventure game. In a press release, Cliffhanger states that “Our mission is to build an expansive and reactive world that empowers players to experience what it is like to take on the mantle of Wakanda’s protector, the Black Panther.”\nCliffhanger is led by Kevin Stephens, formerly of Monolith Productions (a studio currently making a Wonder Woman game), and consists of veteran talent who have worked on titles such as Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, God of War, Halo Infinite, and Call of Duty, among others. The team is still being assembled and is actively hiring. As such, this untitled Black Panther project is very early in development, so it will be a few years before it’s in our hands. \n“We’re dedicated to delivering fans a definitive and authentic Black Panther experience, giving them more agency and control over their narrative than they have ever experienced in a story-driven video game. Wakanda is a rich SuperHero sandbox, and our mission is to develop an epic world for players who love Black Panther and want to explore the world of Wakanda as much as we do,” said Kevin.\nBlack Panther made his comic debut in July 1966, and today’s news coincides with the character’s 57th anniversary. Although he’s been a playable character in numerous Marvel titles, he’s never starred in his own solo game until now. However, it's not the only upcoming game to let players assume the Black Panther mantle. Last year, Amy Hennig's Skydance New Media announced it’s making a Marvel game set during World War II starring Captain America, Black Panther Azzuri (the grandfather of T’Challa), alongside another Wakandan spy and Howling Commando member Gabriel Jones. \nTo keep up with other upcoming superhero games, we've made a list of them for you to check out here.",

The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it?

          "description": "Sonic the Hedgehog co-creator Yuji Naka has been given a suspended prison sentence for insider trading.\nNews of this sentencing comes from IGN (via IGN Japan), which reports that the 57-year-old was \"found guilty of violating Japan's Financial Instruments and Exchange Act\" for insider trading after a July 7 court appearance at the Tokyo District Court. The judge in the case gave Naka a two-and-a-half-year prison sentence but suspended for four years, and two fines of 2 million yen and 170 million yen (approximately $14,000 and $1.1 million respectively). \nThis sentencing comes roughly a month after Abema Times reported in June that prosecutors on the case were asking that Naka go to prison for two years and six months and fines totaling roughly $1.2 million. However, Naka's defense asked that this fine and prison sentence be reduced. The final verdict arrived on July 7 in Japan. \nNaka, who also directed Balan Wonderworld, was arrested in November in connection to an insider trading investigation centered around a new Dragon Quest game. Naka was accused of purchasing 10,000 shares worth 2.8 million yen (roughly $20,000) in Aiming, the company behind that new mobile Dragon Quest game. \nLess than a month later, Naka was arrested once more on a second charge of insider trading; this time involving the now-defunct mobile battle royale, Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier. Naka was accused of purchasing 120,000 shares in Ateam, the developer behind the game, for approximately 144.7 million yen (more than $1 million). \nNaka has now been formally charged and sentenced for insider trading. \n[Source: IGN via IGN Japan]",

          "description": "Despite having pretty enjoyable gameplay, AEW: Fight Forever is woefully light on features and modes. That gets remedied a bit with the announcement that Stadium Stampede is hitting the game in an upcoming free update. \nStadium Stampede sees up to 30 wrestlers compete in a free-for-all inside a giant empty stadium. Like the real-life version, insanity is the name of the game, as players can assault each other using whatever is around them, whether it's chairs, tee shirt guns, Molotovs, golf carts, or even ride atop a horse. The last competitor standing wins, and the reveal trailer sells how much of a goofy mess it’s going to be (in a good way, hopefully). \n\n\nUnfortunately, there's no release date for this update other than that it's coming soon. AEW: Fight Forever has other DLC heading its way in the form of downloadable wrestler packs. FTR (Dax Harwood and Cash Wheeler) were added last month, and a pack containing Keith Lee and The Bunny becomes available on July 25. The final announced pack arrives on August 22 and adds Hook and Danhausen. Each of these packs also includes two new minigames. Each pack costs $11.99 and is included with the season pass. \nFor more on AEW: Fight Forever, check out our review here.",

But a recent report from Kotaku suggests that the company's commitment to the franchise might be going even deeper than we thought; Ubisoft has recently begun the process of remaking Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag. \nThe remake is currently in \"its earliest stages,\" Kotaku reports, so details are scarce, and we won't be seeing it officially for a few years. A team at Ubisoft Singapore, a branch that has contributed to almost every mainline Assassin's Creed game, is said to be heavily involved. Most notably, Ubisoft Singapore worked on the creation of naval combat for Assassin's Creed III and IV, a success that would place it at the head of development for Ubisoft's naval-focused game, Skull and Bones. Of course, Skull and Bones is now notorious for its years of repeated delays – fans of Black Flag will just have to hope the seas will be calmer for the studio's next project.\n\n\nBlack Flag was released in 2013 on the eve of a new console generation, coming to PS3 and 360, but also to PS4, Xbox One, and Wii U. The game follows Edward Kenway – the pirate grandfather of the protagonist Connor from Assassin's Creed III – as he plunders the Caribbean and stumbles into the Assassin Brotherhood. Combining the series' classic stealth gameplay with naval exploration and combat, it's widely regarded as one of the franchise's best entries.

And now we know that game is Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth. As the name suggests, it takes place in 2033, which puts it between the original film and its sequel, Blade Runner 2049. Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth takes place in a dystopian Los Angeles like its cinematic predecessors, and the game's events occur after the Blackout hits. \nNot much else was revealed about the game, but you can check out its moody cinematic trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, this game looks very Blade Runner, and we can't wait to learn more about it. Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth's development is led by game director Chelsea Hash, who previously served as the director of Solar Ash and technical art lead on What Remains of Edith Finch. \nAnnapurna Interactive says Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth is the first new Blade Runner game for consoles and PC in development in 25 years. It's due out sometime in the future on consoles and PC, but there's no word on when to expect it. However, Annapurna Interactive says it will share more details about the game soon. \nAre you excited about this reveal? Let us know in the comments below!",

It looks great – we quite enjoyed playing it recently during Summer Game Fest 2023 – and you can check it out for yourself below in the newest Thirsty Suitors trailer: \n\n\nAs you can see, players take on the role of protagonist Jala, who, after a bad breakup, returns to her hometown. There, she must confront her exes and try to reconcile with them, please her tough-to-please parents, and mend broken friendships in time for her sister's wedding. To do all that, Jala will skateboard, take part in turn-based combat seemingly inspired by Persona and Pokémon, cook meals with her parents, and more. \nThirsty Suitors hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC via Steam on November 2. \nAre you going to check out Thirsty Suitors this November?

Ever since 2004, EA Sports' annualized Madden NFL series has been the exclusive franchise for the NFL, its teams, stadiums, and players. The result was the closure of other franchises, such as the competitive NFL 2K series, as well as the arcade-focused NFL Blitz franchise (which was later acquired by EA in 2011). The recently announced Wild Card Football from Saber Interactive, part of the Playgrounds franchise, hopes to smash through the established line to give players a fresh 7-on-7 arcade-facing take on the sport starring their favorite players.\nWild Card Football doesn't possess the NFL license, but rather the NFLPA license.

          "description": "While game delays have become commonplace, the opposite is extremely rare. Today, we learned Baldur's Gate 3 is somehow doing both at the same time. Initially planned for August 31, developer Larian Studios is advancing the PC release date to August 3 while delaying the PS5 version to September 6. According to the most recent community update, the change was done to prioritize release in order of platform readiness. More specifically, the team needed a little more time to get the PS5 version up to 60 frames per second.\n\"The PlayStation 5 version will be released roughly a week later than its originally scheduled date of August 31st,\" the community update reads. \"Baldur’s Gate 3 is targeting 60 frames-per-second and we’re close to achieving that on the platform but need a bit more extra time. We don’t want to compromise on quality, and feel it would be a shame to downscale to 30fps or make other compromises to hit an arbitrary date.\"\nMeanwhile, the PC version has moved up a whopping four weeks. Larian says, \"This means the PC version of Baldur’s Gate 3 will be released at a time where you’ll have more time to play it,\" likely in reference to the release of Starfield, Bethesda's massive upcoming open-world RPG. By releasing their game over a month earlier, it's a little less likely that gamers would have to choose one or the other to devote their time to.\nThe community update also casts a light cantrip on some of the features coming to the full game, including new spells, the addition of feats, the Half-Orc and Dragonborn races, the monk class, and a huge line-up of new subclasses, which you can see listed below.\nFor more Baldur's Gate 3, check out its Summer Game Fest trailer that revealed Jason Issacs' role in the game.",

While worldbuilding can be as simple as creating fictional characters and cities, some creators dive in deeply, crafting pantheons of gods, hundreds of years of wars and conflict, and even entire languages. While it makes the world more believable, it can be incredibly disorienting for an audience to be thrust headfirst into a sea of unfamiliar proper nouns, especially before they have a chance to get to know the world's characters. Lucky for me, the developers behind Final Fantasy XVI completely anticipated this and introduced a solution: the Active Time Lore mechanic.\nDuring any cutscene in FFXVI, you can hold the tou…",

We’ve now learned, thanks to video game analyst group Circana, that it was, unsurprisingly, the best selling game of the month. However, it’s also already the second best selling game of 2023, behind Hogwarts Legacy. \nWhat’s even more impressive is that Circana’s Tears of the Kingdom numbers do not include digital sales for the game – only physical, according to Circana executive director Mat Piscatella. That it’s the second best selling game of 2023 on just its physical numbers alone means this game sold exceptionally well. And there’s a good chance it might be the year’s best selling game if digital numbers are one day added. \n\n\nHere’s a look at the top 10 best …",

The trailer then cuts to new footage of the game, which you can check out for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Baker says he joined Fort Solis because it allowed him to work alongside Clark (whom you might recognize as Arthur Morgan from Red Dead Redemption 2) and because he liked the story as well. As for the new Fort Solis footage, it shows more of the spooky Martian horror featured in the game. In it, Clark’s character, Jack Leary, tries to survive “through one long and terrifying night on Mars.” Leary appears to be guided, in some way, by Baker’s Wyatt Taylor and Julia Brown’s character, Jessica Appleton. \nFort Solis hits PlayStation 5 and PC on August 22. \nFor more, check out the Fort Solis reveal trailer from last year.\nAre you playing Fort Solis this August?

Similar to Pokemon Showdown, Temtem Showdown is all about battling. It's also free to everyone. \n\"Temtem Showdown takes the best Temtem competitive action and places it within immediate reach for everyone,\" a press release reads. \"Get to know the colorful critters from the massively multiplayer creature-collection adventure, build your team in seconds, and dash into battle to test it out against other players and their teams – or carefully curate a plan of action to overpower your opponents.\" \nUnlike Temtem, which is a multiplayer Pokemon-like game where you catch and train Temtem to use in 2 vs. 2 battles, Showdown will let players build a team from scratch right from the jump. And then you can hop right into a battle, without needing to worry about their level like you might in the base game. You can play against other players both casually and competitively, and the latter will feature a ranked system and a ladder to climb up as you play. \nCrema says Showdown will receive regular balance patches to keep the meta fair, and new Seasons will bring additional content and changes as well. \nFor more, read our thoughts on the base game in Game Informer's Temtem review.",

In the first post, we went into a bit into the infrastructure that runs OpenTTD, from BaNaNaS to our main website. In this post, we will explain a bit about the migration we just did to get to this infrastructure. After over 2 months of work, I am happy to announce we finished (another) infrastructure migration. Today is the day I removed the last few DNS entries pointing to AWS’s DNS servers, and I am proud to mention that (almost) all traffic is now routed via Cloudflare (and we aren’t even receiving sponsoring to say so). In this post I want to take you with me why this migration was needed, what the benefits are, and why you possibly care. But in short summary: (Much) smaller monthly bill as AWS charges insane amounts for bandwidth. Faster download speeds for you (ranging from the in-game content service to downloading the game from our website). Easier maintainability of our infrastructure with thanks to Pulumi.
