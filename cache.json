          "description": "The bottom line drive.\nNow over five years old, the Switch continues to delight and — despite the ageing technology within the diminutive tablet — we still have third-parties eager to support the system. It's unclear how eager Sony was to support the Switch with baseball juggernaut MLB The Show 22, as the series' move to Xbox and now Nintendo's hybrid came at the behest of Major League Baseball. Nevertheless here we are, with a Sony Interactive Entertainment game on Nintendo Switch.\nThe strangeness of booting it up aside, the first impressions of this Switch entry are reassuring; impressive, actually. In the high profile sport-sim example of FIFA in particular, Nintendo players have had to tolerate half-baked annual releases lacking key features, modes and other content. That's not the case here, with developer Sony San Diego continuing its good work — since its move to Xbox a year ago — of parity across all versions in terms of content. Yes, this may be partly to ensure the best monetisation possible from the online 'Diamond Dynasty', but the end result is a full package on Switch with absolutely no content cut.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Lucky 13.\nAtlus is a company that’s sometimes been dubbed a ‘modern Square’ in that it’s become the place in the current industry to get well-budgeted RPG experiences that are equal parts traditional and experimental. It may be known most for its Persona and Shin Megami Tensei games, but the company also sometimes puts out something decidedly more odd, like 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim. This is a release that could best be described as a visual novel, but that genre description doesn’t do justice to what 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim manages to achieve. Whatever you want to call it, Vanillaware's 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim is an experience quite unlike anything else on the Switch right now, and we think you really ought to give it a look.\n13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim follows an ensemble cast of protagonists as they fend off an impending alien threat, utilizing the power of advanced mech suits to accomplish their goal. The story spans several decades as it follows characters in different eras, all roped into the central conflict for different purposes and with distinct motives driving their actions. Natsuno’s story, for example, follows a girl with an obsession for movies about aliens who discovers a cute robot named BJ in her locker room, kicking off an adventure in which she crosses time and space to help it find what it’s looking for.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "A not-so-radical remaster.\nWhenever a developer resurrects a decades-old game, the same question arises along with it: does the remaster maintain the integrity of the original while changing enough to warrant a purchase for both newcomers and longtime fans alike? For Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition, that’s tough to answer. A sequel to Chrono Trigger, Chrono Cross’s first re-release in two decades isn’t feature-filled or resplendent with next-gen graphics to make the game more palatable for a modern audience. No, it’s a remaster in the basest sense of the term: a lick of paint and a handful of bells and whistles for good measure.\nThe Radical Dreamers Edition does however come paired with another game: the elusive visual-novel – titled Radical Dreamers – originally released in 1996 for the Satellaview, a peripheral attachment for the Super Famicom in Japan. Until now there was no way to play Radical Dreamers in the West outside of a fan-translated ROM hack. For fans of the Chrono series, this is more than just a bonus tacked onto a remaster of a beloved game. It’s half the reason to buy the package.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Teardown's a cracking game, about carefully poking holes in destructible environments to prepare for a madcap high-speed heist once an alarm's triggered. I'm excited for it to be done. For now, check out a new trailer show off some of the newness they've added across early access.\nRead more",

          "description": "Steam Deck makers Valve are looking to avoid any further delays in getting their portable PC to the waiting hands of reserve order holders.  The Deck, which launched in February after missing a planned release in December 2021, has only just finished its first round of shipments; now it’s moving into the Q2 2022 phase, Valve are “ramping up shipments” to make sure everybody gets theirs within their current order availability estimate.\r\n\n\r\nThat’s according to the Steam Deck Twitter account, from which Valve also announced that they’re clarifying what these availability estimates actually are. So far these have been given purely as Q2 2022, Q3 2022 and so on, but the Deck’s Steam store page will now list the actual months in that quarter – including your personal delivery estimate, if you’ve already got a reservation waiting. This change won’t affect when the handhelds are ready, it just saves a Google search for anyone less familiar with the business-speak of quarterly codes.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Chrono Cross was one of those Square JRPGs that never made its way to Europe at its original time of release. Heck, the first time I got to play time-travel classic Chrono Trigger was when the Nintendo DS version came out in 2009, almost 15 years after it first came out on the SNES. Chrono Cross, its semi-related but not direct sequel, has taken even longer to get here. First releasing on the original PlayStation in 1999 in Japan (and 2000 in the US), it's finally arriving on PC and modern consoles on April 7th as Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition, which bundles the original game with its accompanying text-based side story Radical Dreamers that only ever released on the ill-fated Satellaview. The latter's original 4:3 pixel art looks mildly ropey blown up on today's screens, but the main game has received all the modern conveniences you've come to expect from Square Enix's recent run of retro PC ports: new HD character models, re-orchestrated music, multiple font options, and the holy grail: a fast-forward button.\nI'm nowhere near the end yet, but from what I've played so far, Chrono Cross is a rollicking good time. There are dozens of characters to meet and recruit to your party that can tangibly change your path through the story, the turn-based battle system offers oodles of depth and variety, and Yasunori Mitsuda's revamped score is right up there with the Final Fantasy greats. For all its buff and polish, though, Chrono Cross has, sadly, also been struck by the same curse as other Square Enix PC ports. The lack of settings options makes it hard to pin down exactly what the problem is, but there's something about the performance and inconsistent frame rate of my review build that's so fundamentally borked that it's like those 22 years haven't even happened. If you, too, have been looking forward to Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition, I'd strongly advise waiting for a few patches to arrive before dipping your toes in.\nRead more",

          "description": "Halo Infinite officially launched last December, receiving rave reviews from critics and fans - including Brendan’s review here at RPS. It peaked with over 200k viewers on Twitch. And for many content creators like Kevin Lynch, aka KevinKoolx, December marked their best month ever in terms of engagement on YouTube and Twitch. Halo, after a decade of somewhat divisive releases, was back. It’s hard to overstate how impressive a feat this was, since the Halo fanbase is almost as divided as the Star Wars one - a seemingly trivial topic like the inclusion of sprint is just one of many decade-long points of contention. But somehow with Halo Infinite 343 Industries created an experience that almost every type of Halo fan could rally behind. But now, just four months after launch, Infinite is struggling to retain its playerbase.\r\n\n Now the Twitch peaks are below 10k and dropping, with the averages even lower. Lynch says February was his worst month views-wise in over a year. You'd expect some tail off after launch for any game, but every content creator I’ve spoken to echoes this sentiment: engagement for Infinite is abnormally low for a live service-game at the beginning of its multi-year journey, especially for a franchise as big as this. The game plays great, so what’s the problem? I spoke to a number of different streamers and content creators to get their point of view.\r\n\n \nRead more",

There’s nothing particularly remarkable about that - I’ve encountered the same thing dozens of times in games - but what comes after is a real doozy.\nNot content simply with nudging the fella into giving in to his worst impulses, I then proceeded to persuade him to wipe the very memory of his nemesis from the galaxy, up to and including hunting down his friends and family members.

While this weakness is outweighed by the pleasures of playing PC games in bed or on the bus, most such games will drain the Deck quickly, requiring a degree of foresight if you want to entertain yourself on a long trip away from mains power. At the same time, different games will drain at different speeds, with some allowing Valve’s handheld to last hours longer than others.\r\n\n\r\nUltimately, I think the only truly accurate way to measure and judge the Steam Deck’s battery life is to test a bunch of different games to see how long it lasts with each. So I have! Here you’ll find a list of games with how long they took to empty the Deck’s battery from full. I’ll be coming back and adding more to the list as I test them, so you can see for yourself what uptimes to expect from your favourites.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Nate, meanwhile, wants to go all-in on a Dungeon Keeper sitcom, and The Office-like monster relationships therein. \nRead more",

Whichever way you slice it, though, Superfuse makes a striking and violent first impression. \nPerhaps it's because I'm playing as its Berserker class, a large walking slab of man muscle whose axe and (comically large) fists can pulverise anything and everything standing in its way. Or maybe it's because the devs have given me free rein of the game's extensive skill tree, letting me pile in dozens of points into attacks, abilities and power-ups normally reserved for later on. Superfuse may be a loot-driven hack and slash with hundreds of different weapons and armour components to pick from, but its skill tree is equally vast, giving you as much flexibility in how your attacks play out onscreen as your various wardrobe choices - and some of its effects are deliciously gory.\nRead more",

Filling the graveyard has been a solemn bid for order in the wake of so much chaos.\nIt’s not that way in Bripton, the next town over. The graveyard there is uncannily empty, save for a similarly bare tree. But you can change that, should you so choose: shoot up the bank or fight a duel and, the next time you return to that settlement, new plots will have appeared for every life snuffed out. Weird West even suggests you head to the local cemetery to loot any bodies you’ve missed - though its reputational system implies you should ensure nobody’s watching first.\nRead more",

          "description": "It's a strange thing, returning to the world of Death Stranding after more than a year away. Having done that classic thing of rinsing almost every last delivery out of it before finally strapping myself in for its rollercoaster ending back in 2020, there hasn't been much reason to return to my precious, daft BB Boys in the intervening months - not even its Cyberpunk 2077 crossover was enough to tempt me back. At long last, though, I have cause to load up the BB train again. Death Stranding Director's Cut arrives on Steam and the Epic Games Store today, bringing with it new story missions, new delivery buddies, new weapons and... a Mario Kart-style race track? Yep, that sounds like a classic Kojima upgrade pack, if you ask me. Not quite as revolutionary as Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence, mind, but it's roughly in the same kind of ballpark. \nIt's been great fun revisiting the lush mountains of Death Stranding's definitely not Icelandic version of post-apocalyptic America. If anything, the weirdest thing is seeing that same world I know and love on a fresh server, bereft of all the distracting neon signs, yelps of \"Keep on keeping on!\" and one-upmanship bridge-building that made up the bulk of the original's asymmetric online multiplayer component. It's actually quite refreshing to see these virgin, unspoiled landscapes again, although I imagine this won't last long once returning players flock back to their well-worn delivery routes. As for the new new stuff, is it worth making a return trip? As with all expando games, the answer will very much depend on if and how much you played the first one. \nRead more",

          "description": "After months of rumours, Sony have finally unveiled their answer to Xbox Game Pass today. Starting this June, their new subscription service will unite PlayStation Plus and their cloud streaming platform PlayStation Now under one roof, offering three different tiers of membership. Most of it isn't that relevant to us on PC, but the final, most expensive tier, PlayStation Plus Premium, will include that aforementioned cloud streaming to PC, letting us play hundreds of PS1, PS2, PS3, PS4 and PSP games without having to own an actual PlayStation.\nIt's not yet clear how that library of games will differ from the current PlayStation Now library, but one thing is certain: this is a move that definitely benefits people with a PlayStation and a PC more than it does standalone PC peeps. And yet, even as someone who falls into the former camp of PlayStation and PC owners, I'm still not sure this new PS+ is something I actually want. Sure, there's that massive retro collection on offer, but no Day One games I can either play on my console or stream to PC? On your bike, Sony. Personally, I see this as more of a dip-in and dip-out kinda deal to indulge my occasional retro cravings, but I'm keen to know what you, RPS readers, think of this new PS Plus offering as well. Does it appeal in any shape or form? And how does it compare to Game Pass for you? Let's chat about it below. \nRead more",

Other Prospectors will murder you for your precious rocks and weeds, so your aim is to get a helicopter out of Fortuna before this happens.

Every day you wake up, leave your apartment and hit the streets, chatting to the locals, picking up a bit of info, even gambling a bit. The folks you meet are from the shadier side of society and they'll hire you for jobs. Sometimes it’s simple burglary, sometimes it's breaking a vase, or snatching a specific bit of loot. There’s even a guy who keeps trying to offer me wet work! It all boils down to the same thing though: sneaking around some rich guy’s place, disabling the security, avoiding or taking down the occupants, and getting out without being caught. Afterwards, I fence the loot and head to bed.\nIt's all building up to Abermore's central heist: The Feast of the Lucky Few. It's also my only chance to rescue the famous Hanged Man, a dame I met on the boat over here. They're the thief of thieves! A living legend! But the tyrant king grabbed her before we got ashore and she’ll be executed in eighteen days if I don’t break her out. That’s eighteen nights to prepare, eighteen jobs to build the resources, the connections I need for the heist of a life time. A terrible shame, then, that alarm bells started ringing almost as soon as I started playing.\nRead more",

          "description": "The makers of The Forest announced over the weekend that they're delaying the launch of the craft-o-survival horror game's sequel, Sons Of The Forest. Previously due on the 20th of May, it's now expected in October. Developers Endnight Games offer the usual reason: they want more time to make it good, yeah? I'm fine with waiting a while for more wonderful unpleasantness.\nRead more",

          "description": "The four-sided heroes of Patrick's Parabox and Wilmot's Warehouse would be great friends, I think. They both specialise in the placement and movement of boxes, and they both share the same cheery disposition. Sure, Patrick may not have the same pointy nose or cheeky smile of his mate Wilmot, but the way his eyes rove from side to side as he wiggles to the beat of Priscilla Snow's meditative and upbeat electronic soundtrack is surely a sign of someone who is truly in love with what they do. \nIf anything, I reckon Wilmot would be a wee bit jealous of Patrick. You see, in Patrick's line of work, his cubes contain multitudes, to misquote that famous Walt Whitman line. As long as they're resting against a hard surface, cubes can be packed into other cubes in Patrick's Parabox like a stack of matryoshka dolls. They can also be unpacked in the same way, allowing him to navigate the tight constraints of his respective puzzle arenas with surprising dexterity. It's like he's discovered the TARDIS of sokoban-style cube-pushing, if you will, and cor, just imagine what Wilmot could do with such technology. That warehouse would be immaculate. \nRead more",

They are, after all, the reason its ludicrous scale is workable at all beyond the opening hours, and a major reason its predecessor was so interesting and forward-thinking to begin with. But they are also a source of great friction and confusion, especially if you don't take the time to learn how they actually work.\nDistant Worlds 2 is, ultimately, a game that you need to meet in the middle.

I'm always up for a good Zelda-like, and everything I saw of Tunic back then seemed to confirm that this was 100% a game I would like and enjoy. \nYou can probably imagine my excitement, then, when Microsoft announced there would finally be a playable demo to people download during last year's E3. However, as I briefly mentioned in my post about Tunic's brilliant in-game instruction manual yesterday, I actually came away from that demo a bit disheartened. With just a single (and quite unforgiving) dungeon to explore, I was left thinking it hewed a bit too close to the Soulsian school of combat difficulty than I'd like. Upon playing the final game, however... Delight! Magic! Joy! I actually can't get enough of it. To think I almost dismissed what's now one of my early game of the year contenders on the basis of that one 20 minute demo now seems incredibly hasty on my part, but with so many games now being shoved down our throats on a daily basis, those first impressions can be devastatingly powerful. \nRead more",

Drinkbox Studios has announced it will release Nobody Saves the World on PlayStation consoles and Switch this month.\nAlong with the new console editions of Nobody Saves the World, Drinkbox is introducing local co-op to the game on all versions on the same day. It previously featured online cooperative play, but this update will allow for multiple people in the same room, maybe even the same couch, to play together. What a concept! The Switch version can be played in tabletop mode, with each player using a single Joy-Con, while the PS5 and PS4 versions will recieve cross-gen compatibility for its online play.\nA new trailer was released alongside the announcement showing off gameplay and promoting the review scores the game received on its initial release a few months back.\nClick here to watch embedded media\nNobody Saves the World puts players in the shoes of a weakling \"nobody\" who acquires the magic wand of a powerful sorcerer, granting him the ability to change his form at will. He'll have to use this shape-shifting to purge a goofy kingdom of corruption that's plaguing the land. I really enjoyed my time with Nobody Saves the World, giving the Xbox and PC releases an 8.25 out of 10. It's fun, wacky, and provides plenty of opportunities for player expression in the versatile form-swapping system. Read my full review to find out why its worth checking out.\nDrinkbox Studios will launch Nobody Saves the World on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and Switch on April 14. You can play it now on Xbox consoles through Game Pass and PC.",

Like the 80s and 90s movies that inspired it, the summer camp is very much a major part of The Quarry as is the cast of young people together there with little to no supervision. In it, nine teenage camp counselors are left overnight at Hackett Quarry, free of kids, supervision, and most importantly to the tropes Supermassive is riffing on rules. \nAs expected, things go awry and people start to die as “something far more sinister” begins to hunt them throughout the night, according to a press release from the studio. It will be up to you to control and interact with characters played by actors like David Arquette (the Scream series), Lin Shaye (A Nightmare on Elm Street, Insidious), Ted Raimi (the Evil Dead Series, Candyman, The Grudge), Ariel Winter (Modern Family), Justice Smith (Detective Pikachu), and Brenda Song (The Suite Life of Zack and Cody, Dollface), amongst others. \nIf you’re interested to see what all of this looks like in action, you now can, thanks to 30 minutes of gameplay from The Quarry’s gameplay, which is now live over on IGN as part of the publication’s month-long coverage of Supermassive Games’ latest. You can watch it below: \nClick here to watch embedded media\nFor more about The Quarry, be sure to read about the reveal of it from last month, and then check out this story about how Supermassive Games wants to avoid problematic tropes in The Quarry.  \nAre you excited for The Quarry?

However, if you’re looking for anything more about the game, that’s sadly all that was shared. \nCrystal Dynamics is incredibly excited about the future of Unreal and how it will help us take our storytelling to the next level. That's why we're proud to announce that our next #tombraider game is being built on Unreal Engine 5! pic.twitter.com/UFMiWzJAZc\nApril 5, 2022\nHere’s what was announced, in full, by Crystal Dynamics’ Tomb Raider franchise general manager Dallas Dickinson: \nAs for what to expect from this Tomb Raider game, it will likely continue the story of the recent trilogy from Crystal Dynamics (with help from Eidos-Montréal on the final entry). However, that’s pure speculation – there’s always the possibility that Crystal Dynamics could reboot Tomb Raider once more, just like it did in 2013. However, the studio always referred to its trilogy reboot as an origin story for its Lara Croft so perhaps this new Unreal Engine 5-powered Tomb Raider will be the first game in the reboot’s timeline where Lara Croft is the tomb raider many think of when they hear the words “Tomb Raider.” Only time will tell. \nFor now, read about everything announced during today’s Unreal Engine 5 presentation, and then read Game Informer’s thoughts on the most recent Tomb Raider game in our Shadow of the Tomb Raider review. \nAre you excited for a new Tomb Raider game?

Plus, to get people started on their Unreal Engine 5 journey, both in development and those who want to mess with it more casually, Epic Games has released Lyra, a new playable shooter demo.

This gives users the chance to tinker with lighting, platform locations, and more. \nClick here to view embedded media\n \n\nEpic Games also released City Sample, another Unreal Engine 5 demo, but unlike Lyra, this one isn’t playable.

          "description": "Publisher No More Robots and developer Tendershoot held a Hypnospace Next presentation today, revealing what comes next for the Hypnospace Outlaw series, and it's not one but two new games coming this year.\nClick here to watch embedded media\nFirst is a spiritual successor to Hypnospace called Dreamsettler, set in an alternate reality in the early 2000s. In Dreamsettler, you'll play as an internet private detective trying to solve problems for other users on the Somnius Sleepnet Systems. There will be all kinds of familiar references while surfing this shifted reality version of a burgeoning time for the web. You'll experience an early version of social media, listen to alternate-reality genres of music, and explore a version of the 00s internet that's much like our own but with some abnormalities. Although, No More Robots hints it will get weirder as it gets even darker.\nClick here to watch embedded media\nAlso announced is Slayers X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengance of the Slayer, a spinoff of sorts from the original Hypnospace outlaw starring ZANE_ROCKS_14, or Zane Lofton as he's known in the fictional real world. In 2022, 37-year-old Zane, who is now a manager at a DollarSaver, finds a game he made when he was 14 called Slayers X. Naturally, he decides to rerelease his boomer shooter (its very Doom-like) in 2022 with some upgrades. \nBoth games are slated to release sometime this year and will be coming to consoles and PC, but neither title has a date yet. \nAre you looking forward to playing these Hypnospace Outlaw spinoffs? Let us know in the comments!",

For that reason, it’s easy to imagine a sequel or follow-up to it, even though it does end quite nicely, all things considered. However, it doesn’t sound like one is in the cards. \nIn a new interview with Edge magazine, Tales of Arise producer Yusuke Tomiwaza said that a sequel isn’t happening, as reported by GamesRadar. Tomiwaza alluded to the team developing Arise in such a way that a sequel wouldn’t be necessary, citing that he hoped the story would be complete “with a good aftertaste” when players roll credits, eliminating the need for a sequel altogether. \nClick here to watch embedded media\nTomizawa continued, citing that the studio wants “to continue to take on the challenge of…acquiring new fans for further expansion of JRPGs,” and that in order to do that, “we need to come up with a cutting-edge flagship title that builds on the success of Arise, while also providing an opportunity to rediscover the history of the series.” \nAs GamesRadar points out, a lack of a sequel to Arise isn’t necessarily the worst news ever for fans because as fans of the series likely know, we’re probably just a few years away from another Tales game. Having been around for more than two decades, with 17 mainline games in it, it’s safe to say another Tales game is likely on the way. \nWhile waiting for that, read Game Informer’s Tales of Arise review and then check out why it’s on Game Informer’s list of the top 10 RPGs to play right now. Read about this stylish Tales of Arise and Scarlet Nexus crossover after that. \n[Source: GamesRadar]\nDo you want a sequel to Tales of Arise? Let us know why in the comments below!",

They highlight all the changes Square Enix has implemented, including graphics switching, speeding up gameplay, and so much more.

While the game is playable, the frame rate takes noticeable dips from time to time, and both Kim and Stadnik noticed the game can be stuttery during their hands-on time with the Switch version. Is it enough to derail the experience?

As for why, PlayStation leadership reportedly cited a “global transformation” of the company’s sales and business operations in the U.S. and elsewhere. \nThe cuts, which have not been publicly disclosed by Sony or its PlayStation arm, happened last week, one laid-off employee told Axios. More specifically, documents reveal Sony PlayStation is ending its “merchandiser” team in the U.S., with roles like PlayStation Representatives and more terminated. These employees were often responsible for going to brick-and-mortar stores to sell PlayStation products and educate employees there on those products.\nMultiple retail marketing jobs were cut as well, according to Axios. One worker laid off told the publication that they felt the company could have done more to find laid-off employees alternate jobs within it. They also said they were disappointed PlayStation had not told the affected departments sooner than they did.\n[Source: Axios]",

Then, some began to speculate that somehow, Hideo Kojima was behind Abandoned and Blue Box – Blue Box was seen as “BB,” like the term used throughout Death Stranding. Despite Blue Box saying it was not associated with Hideo Kojima, the studio leaned into it, posting an image of a hidden face with a very Metal Gear Solid-esque eye patch. \nBlue Box reiterated that it was not associated with Kojima and a few days later, people spotted another tie between the famed director and the studio. Things subsided for a few weeks and then Blue Box posted yet another thing that caused people to further speculate on the Blue Box-Kojima connection. Since all of this, Blue Box’s playable Abandoned prologue has yet to be released as promised in Q1 of 2022 and speculation that Abandoned had been canceled began to rise. \nHowever, in a new statement from Blue Box, the studio has addressed these cancellation rumors. Here’s what it says, in full: \nFor more about the game, be sure to check out Game Informer’s Abandoned hub. \nAre you excited for Blue Box’s Abandoned? Let us know in the comments below!",

Now, it’s time for a new Mystery Gift and this time, it’s a member card for the mythical Darkrai.

Be sure to pick it up before May 1 to add it to your Pokédex. \nFor more about Pokémon, read about Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet, which are coming to Switch in “late 2022.” After that, check out our running list of every Pokémon confirmed for Scarlet and Violet, and then read Game Informer’s review of Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl. \nAre you going to pick up Darkrai this month?

Some of his attacks were less frequent, it seemed, but more noticeably, his attacks didn’t do near as much damage as pre-patch Radahn. However, it turns out this nerf was unintentional because in a new update out today, From Software calls it a bug that’s now been fixed. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n“Fixed a bug in the balance adjustment of the boss ‘Starscourge Radahn’ in update 1.03, in which the power of some attacks was unintentionally reduced,” the patch notes read. \nAs you can see, From Software is very clearly referring to the Radahn nerf as unintentional and also a bug that was never meant to occur. We haven’t yet fought Radahn since this update, but we’re excited (and scared) to see what the fight is like now. \nIt’s important to note that today’s update is an update to a previously-released patch: Patch 1.03. As a result, this update does not do anything else for Elden Ring – it simply fixes the Radahn balance and that’s it. For reference, Patch 1.03 was released in March and this update is live as of today, April 4, 2022. \nFor more about Elden Ring, read Game Informer’s Elden Ring Beginner’s Guide, which features nine essential tips and tricks for new players, and then check out this guide on how to beat every boss in Elden Ring easily.

Bioshock level designer Jordan Thomas sat in the creative director's chair for the sequel, a major promotion that proved challenging both artistically and mentally for the rookie leader. We discuss the original premise of the Big Sister, the game's more action-oriented approach, as well as how its acclaimed Minerva's Den expansion led to the founding of indie studio Fullbright.\nJoin hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), John Carson (@John_Carson), and Game Informer Video Editor Alex Stadnik (@Studnik76) as we unpack the history and narrative of Bioshock's sophomore outing!\nIf you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com.

The indie development studio behind the series Aether Studios revealed the first trailer for the game today, and it's definitely not a joke.\nRivals 2 jumps to detailed 3D models, a huge visual change from the 16-bit inspired sprites from the original. The footage shown looks gorgeous, showing HUD-less gameplay of three Rivals duking it out. Fiery lion Zetterburn, the wind wielder Wrastor, and the poisonous frog martial artist Ranno all make their return and have plenty of screentime showing off their updated looks and moves. \nClick here to watch embedded media\nWhile new characters weren't shown in the trailer, new mechanics were. Those who are familiar with Super Smash Bros. may be very comfortable with the additions. Shields are being added as a defensive mechanism, as well as grabs to counter them. Also, \"throws look cool,\" says an FAQ answer for why they've been added to the game. More nuanced questions and answers for changes being made to the combat in Rivals 2 can be found on the game's FAQ page.\nRivals 2 isn't expected to release until 2024, according to Aether Studios, but does plan to hold a closed beta sometime next year. The original Rivals of Aether is currently available on Xbox One, Switch, and PC.",
