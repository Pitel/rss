Given that the device is portable in nature, it stands to reason that plenty of cases are available – especially with the Switch being five years old now – and we've seen a wide variety of different options, too. Some cases merely prevent damage during transit, while others bolt onto the console itself to offer that extra layer of protection. There are also options that include internal batteries, shifting the focus from protection to stamina.\nThe Plenbo G-Case does all of these things, and a little more besides. It's a modular offering that not only includes an internal (and swappable) 5000mAh battery pack but also includes its own kickstand, Joy-Con holder and customisable grips. Oh, and it has its own Bluetooth 5.0 transmitter which allows you to pair two sets of wireless headphones, as well as its own dock for charging and TV play.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "In a move befitting a game about immortal beings who live out countless repeating lives on artificial islands powered by human sacrifice, Paradise Killer is getting a re-release. Sort of. It's coming to next-gen consoles today, with all platforms (including PC) getting some extra bits added for free that weren't in the original 2020 release. Not bad for a game that Kaizen Game Works creative director Oli Clarke Smith thought would only really sell to \"a niche of freaks\". If you're not one of those freaks, I'd heartily recommend becoming one. Playing Paradise Killer is like going to a seaside cosplay party where police procedurals play on loop and cocktails are snorted in a dehydrated powder form. It is a meticulously authored murder mystery with a cast of freaks.\nWhen I sat down to talk to both Clarke Smith and technical director Phil Crabtree about Paradise Killer's new update, it turns out that niche has already become quite large. Even Crabtree's dad has played Paradise Killer, though Crabtree isn't sure he really understood it. Crabtree also tells us he sometimes get messages from friends saying someone they know just played Paradise Killer and was talking about it. \"It just seems so weird that that there is this audience there that we never expected, and it doesn't seem that far away,\" he says. \"Like, it's not this mystery group of people, there always seems to be some connection that's quite close to you.\"\nRead more",

The sheer speed of the first game made it pretty popular among race-heads, but a bit of a daunting prospect for those used to a traditional “wheels on the ground” racing experience.\nRedout 2 doubles down on the speed element, that's for sure. But there's definitely an added air of approachability to this anti-grav racer, making the transition from Geforce to g-force a little less bruising than before. AI presets, added customisation, and more generous modes help make this a racing game you should keep up with.\nRead more",

          "description": "You may not have heard much about developer Complex Games, but the Canadian studio has a surprisingly storied history. Despite spending the last two decades building mobile and browser games for the likes of Disney, Nickelodeon and Zynga, their heart has always resided with the PC. \"There wasn't a lot of game development in Winnipeg, so we tried to figure it out ourselves and spent a few years trying to build a PC game,\" says creative director Noah Decter-Jackson. Fresh out of college, Complex's first project was a third-person hand-to-hand action prototype that they pitched to publishers at E3 2003, an endeavour that Decter-Jackson describes as \"phenomenally unsuccessful\".\nThis led to Complex remodelling as a work-for-hire outfit, and their long track-record making mobile games. But in 2015, Complex launched The Horus Heresy: Drop Assault, a fast-paced tactics game in conjunction with Games Workshop. In the wake of Drop Assault's success, the studio saw an opportunity. \"We had been wanting for a long time to return to our PC roots,\" he says. \"So we pitched a core idea for a game to Games Workshop, because Drop Assault had been quite successful... and that's essentially how Chaos Gate: Daemonhunters came to be.\"\nRead more",

          "description": "I can't remember if I've mentioned this to you, dear readers, but I am currently mid-emigration. In about two weeks I'm moving to Ireland, which means for the past four months my live has been hellish. The paperwork the move involves, especially now we have from our European womb been untimely ripped, is a Kafkaesque nightmare. To ship my stuff without incurring importation tax I need to prove I'm going to live in Ireland and not just sell a bunch of second hand cutlery and old bras (one of those two things would probably be pretty lucrative, in fairness). This is all complicated even furtherer by the fact that I only found a flat to move to yesterday, and still don't have the tenancy agreement for it, which means no proof of address. Life, oh life.\nI don't really have the option to have a piece of toast and watch the evening news, because when I'm not scanning my passport or estimating what worth to attach to my towels for the purposes of the shipping company's insurance, I am packing said towels into boxes, along with everything else I own. Basically the only free time I have is my lunch break. And what I am doing in my lunch break is making huge, virtual jigsaw puzzles in Jigsaw Puzzle Dreams. It's either that or go and sit in the toilets and have a little stress-cry. And as the move date approaches, the size of the puzzles has increased. On Thursday I started one that is 6k pieces. This may have been a miscalculation.\nRead more",

It's all open worship and overt power, conquering and seizing so you're only superficially different to a 4X or management game.\r\n\n\nShadows Of Forbidden Gods is different. It's all about building the power of your evil god under the radar until it's too late for anyone to defeat you. The more I've played it, the more I start to suspect that this concept will always suffer from being gamed by player who'll seek the most efficient paths. Any system of influencing and manipulating characters will necessarily be abstracted, and at some point subtlety becomes just another numerical value.\r\n\n\r\nI suppose what I'm saying is that SOFG is more fun if you revel in scheming and causing chaos, and given the choice between effective and interesting, will always do the right thing.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Machines don't count as mounts, I think we can all pre-agree on that. We discuss a lot of different horses, and some things that are not horses, from a bunch of different games. This is an unfortunate crossover with our 'best horses' special, which I forgot we had done. Also, Nate and I get angry at Metal Gear Solid.\nThere are some traditional digressions, although there's no substantial Henry Cavill update this week. We spend some time discussing which dinosaur we would most like to ride as a mount, and whether we would rather fight one The Rock sized spider, or 30 spider sized The Rocks. This week's Cavern of Lies is WoW-themed, and if you'd like to listen along to Latvia's Eurovision entry this year then here's the link. Be warned that it is NSFW.\nRead more",

Others who've bought into the same Fruit Winder exchange thoughts on its sour taste, until yet more, who quite like the flavour, come to its defense in droves. A war of words ensues over whether the Fruit Winder tastes nice. And it's not even a Fruit Winder, it's an app called Facebook, or Twitter, or Instagram, for goodness sakes.\nAdmittedly, there is something gratifying about popping off on social media. Even just getting a few likes for a dumb joke can make you feel alive. So, I say you swap Twitter for Elden Ring, a superior social media platform: You leave players helpful messages or total dross, it gets appraised, you feel great.

For its first 15 hours or so, Smilegate's ARPG is like someone described Lord of the Rings to the developers through a door, an overblown yet generic riff on Western fantasy tropes with overdesigned yet underwritten characters, all of whom talk about the game's plainly ridiculous lore with the gravity of a neutron star. The game's ignorance of its own absurdity is funny, but the story itself is not much fun.\r\n\n\r\nThis begins to change once you approach level 50. After completing the continent of East Luterra, Lost Ark suddenly explodes in scale. It gives you a ship, and sets you off on a massive globetrotting adventure, with around a dozen other continents to explore, and dozens more tiny islands, each with their own little questlines. Your first destination across Lost Ark's ocean is an island called Tortoyk (pronounced like \"Tortoise\", but with a K), and it's here where the game stops pretending to be a serious high-fantasy adventure, revealing itself to be something much more entertaining.\r\n\n \nRead more",

In Valhalla this manifests as protagonist Eivor, Viking raider and big blonde buff meat sculpture, being the reincarnation of Odin, one of the aforementioned god-people. Dawn Of Ragnarök is Eivor dreaming that they are Odin for about 35 hours of adventuring and son-saving in the magical realm of Svartalfheim. That's a pretty intense nap.\nRead more",

The Fertile Crescent trades the ol’ berry bush for pomegranate trees, a native of Western Asia.\r\n\n\r\nDevelopers Anders Groenningsaeter and André Read from Wield Interactive looked to the past as they refined The Fertile Crescent’s economy. “Since childhood, André and I have been equally fascinated by RTS games and the Bronze Ages,” Groenningsaeter explained to me. “How we’ve been inspired by history has shaped the game. During the Bronze Ages, the usage of coins hadn’t taken root yet. It was still to a large extent a barter economy, and food played an important role.”\r\n\n \nRead more",

I've said before I've never been much of a Soulsite, and it's not for lack of trying. I tried my darnedest to get into Dark Souls III when it first came out, but holy deathrattles, it was such a long, gruelling slog. Vordt of the Boreal Valley, the second (yes, second) boss of Dark Souls III, remains my lifelong nemesis. I just couldn't get past it. I'm someone who always likes to be making forward, tangible progress when I play games, and banging my head against the same boss for hours on end is my idea of actual hell.\nI'm no better at playing Elden Ring, to be honest. I spent a good couple of hours last night just trying to get past one of those big tentacle-beard monkey lads with the hollowed out stomachs on the way up to Stormveil Castle. Not even a named, actual sub-boss! And yet, I'm actually enjoying this version of Souls-style head-bashing a lot more than I've ever done before.

While the MSI GeForce RTX 3050 Gaming X 8G model I’ve tested has already ballooned to £380 / $450, this leaves it looking like much more of a  genuine alternative to RTX 3060, which is generally around £500 in the UK.

It’s been doing EA Play Live since 2016. Before the onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the event was a live in-person event where players could play things shown during the showcase and more. However, as a result of the pandemic, the event became a steaming one, akin to something like a Nintendo Direct or PlayStation State of Play. \nThis news comes just a few months after word that E3 would not be held as in-person event this year dropped. However, Geoff Keighley’s own E3-like event, Summer Games Fest, is happening this year as usual. \nWhile waiting to see what EA shows throughout the year, check out the latest footage of its Dead Space remake. Read about how EA pledged total freedom to its studios with game development, including Dragon Age, Titanfall, and more last year after that. \n[Source: IGN]\nWhat EA game are you most excited about seeing more of this year?

From the humble top-down beginnings of Grand Theft Auto to the blood-soaked streets of Manhunt and the beautiful jaw-dropping vistas of Red Dead Redemption, you’ll find every single title put in its proper place in terms of influence, importance of innovation, and just plain fun.\nWith all that in mind, let’s steal a ride and roar down this road to hell.

That’s because the game sports not one, not two, but six graphical and performance options.\nWe’re reviewing Ghostwire: Tokyo and have listed each mode along with their in-game explanation. However, the game only lays out what the two primary modes do, which are:  \nQuality Mode: A high-fidelity rendering mode with ray tracing enabled. 30 FPS limit\nPerformance Mode: A high-framerate mode designed for the smoothest gameplay. 60 FPS limit.\nAdditionally, a category labeled HFR (High Framerate) is described as having \"an uncapped framerate and tweaks to graphic quality that allow for an even higher-framerate experience.\" It contains four options without descriptions, but Video Games Chronicle expounded on these which we’ve shared below:\nHigh Framerate Quality: Quality mode with an uncapped framerate between 30-50 FPS.\nHigh Framerate Performance: Performance mode with uncapped framerate over 60 FPS.\nHigh Framerate Quality (VSync): Same as High Framerate Quality but with Vsync enabled. \nHigh Framerate Performance (VSync): Same as High Framerate Performance but with Vsync enabled.\nGames with multiple graphical/performance options have become the norm in recent years, but Ghostwire: Tokyo may take the cake, and figuring out which one is “best” will depend on several factors (such as your monitor) as well as personal preference. \nGhostwire: Tokyo launches March 25 on PlayStation 5 and PC.

The digital edition of the DLC will be available for preorder today, producer Ryozo Tsujimoto revealed. Along with the base edition of Sunbreak, existing Monster Hunter Rise players will have the option to purchase a deluxe edition, which comes with additional cosmetics like Layered Armod, hairstyles, poses, and gestures. Preordering will net hunters a pair of adorable Palamute and Palico Layered Armor that make the animal companions look closer to their real-world pet counterparts.\nThose who are new to Monster Hunter Rise, but want the whole experience when Sunbreak releases can purchase the Monster Hunter Rise + Sunbreak Set which bundles the full base game and the expansion together into one tidy package.\nAnnounced to be released alongside Sunbreak is a new trio of Monster Hunter Amiibos. The set of three includes new Elder Dragon Malzeno and a Palamute and Palico each donning armor based on Malzeno. Using these Amiibos with the Switch version will grant players new Formal Dragon Layered Armor to use in-game.\nA patch will be coming for all Monster Hunter Rise players on June 30 regardless of Sunbreak ownership status. The update will require about 13GB of storage space and will accommodate for weapon balance changes and new content coming to the game with the release of Sunbreak. This patch will be required for online play moving forward.\nIf you're interested in trying out Monster Hunter Rise with Sunbreak looming on the horizon, Nintendo is offering a free trial for Switch Online subscribers this week.",

More specifically, the survey recently sent out is all about the graphics and visuals of Babylon’s Fall, and finding a way to “bring everyone an even better game experience.” \nEurogamer reports that the survey asks players about their thoughts on the visuals of characters, equipment, NPCs, enemies, locales, battle effects, the UI, and the overall oil painting “brushwork” art style of Babylon’s Fall. The survey concludes by asking survey-takers what specific element of Babylon’s Fall’s visuals would need to be changed before they’d consider recommending the game to someone else. \nHowever, as anyone who’s played Babylon’s Fall or has read reviews for it know, there are multiple problems beyond the visual elements that make it hard to recommend. Perhaps Square Enix will canvass players about all of the elements viewed more negatively in the game and then fix each one so that with all of the fixes together, people might be able to recommend the game to someone. That remains to be seen, of course. \nIf you’re curious about checking the game out yourself, you can do so thanks to a free PlayStation demo for Babylon’s Fall that’s available right now.

          "description": "If you can’t get enough of everyone’s favorite blue blur, or Tails and Knuckles, as they’re depicted in Paramount Pictures’ movies, then we have some good news for you: there’s a “pre-quill” comic book for Sonic the Hedgehog 2 coming out later this month. \nAs reported by Sonic Stadium, this prequel comic will lead into Sonic the Hedgehog 2 before it hits theaters on April 8 and part of it will be helmed by the movie’s own Dr. Robotnik, Jim Carrey. That’s because the comic book isn’t one big story but rather, five stories about different characters from the movie spread across 40 pages. One of these five stories will be centered on Dr. Robotnik and according to Sonic Stadium, Carrey is “spearheading” it. \nHowever, it’s important to note that Carrey does not have a writer’s credit in the comic solicitation so it’s likely that he simply helped out with the narrative, or shared ideas with the comic’s writer, Keil Phegley. \n“Catch up with Sonic and friends, if you can, in this exclusive prequel to 2022’s most anticipated family film,” the comic book’s solicitation reads, according to Sonic Stadium. “Life is good in Green Hills for Sonic the Hedgehog…maybe too good. He’s starting to get bored, and when Sonic gets bored, things become a lot less boring for everyone else – fast. Quicker than you can say, ‘Chili Dog,’ the Fastest Thing Alive is saving the day and causing all sorts of chaos along the way. Plus, new and returning characters starring in the Sonic the Hedgehog 2 film take the lead in stories of their own.” \nFor more about Sonic, check out this awesome poster for the movie, and then watch the final trailer for Sonic the Hedgehog 2 released today. Read about Sonic Frontiers, which drops the blue blur into his first open-world game, after that. \n[Source: Sonic Stadium]\nAre you going to pick up this prequel comic?

Ultimate, it seems. And while he’s back to work, a new statement from the director teases that what he’s working on might not be a video game. \nNews of Sakurai’s return to work comes from Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu, as translated by GoNintendo, which reports that Sakurai has revealed that he is, in fact, working on something. As for what, we might find out in the near future but Sakurai hints that it might not be related to gaming in any way. \n“I have been away for a while now, but I am working on something,” Sakurai told Famitsu, as translated by GoNintendo. “My eyes may be a little tired. You may see me in the near future in a place that has nothing to do with game production. You may or may not be able to see me. I hope to see you again in the future. Thank you very much for your time.” \nAs you can see in the statement above, Sakurai seems to be dropping hints to his fans that they shouldn’t be expecting a new game from him anytime soon. Perhaps he’s working on something that’s very behind-the-scenes, or maybe he’s jumped industries and is now working in movie production or something like that. Only time will tell. \nFor now, read about Sakurai’s journey to get Sora from Kingdom Hearts, the final fighter in Ultimate, in the game, and then check out this story about how Sakurai isn’t thinking about a sequel to Ultimate but won’t rule one out despite that. Read about how Sakurai thinks the next game in the Smash Bros. series would need a smaller roster and less dependence on his own vision after that. \n[Source: Famitsu via GoNintendo]\nAre you excited to see what Sakurai is working on?

She's not alone, however; former antagonist Nadine Ross partners with her, leading to an odd-couple-style treasure hunt that may be shorter than Uncharted 4 but was just as entertaining. Prior to this, Naughty Dog batted around other combinations of characters for this adventure including Sully and Sam Drake. How did the team turn The Lost Legacy around so quickly after A Thief's End? What's the deal with that \"wimpy\" train explosion? Listen here to hear the answers to these questions and more. \nJoin hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), and former Game Informer intern O'Dell Harmon Jr. (@ODellHarmonJr) as we unpack the history and narrative of the final Uncharted game to date.

We also dive into The Batman, which I give a score and review to, and also discuss Gotham Knights' new release date!\nIf you would like to follow us on Twitter: Andrew Reiner (@Andrew_Reiner) and Philip Hoff (@bnow23).\nFrom Panel to Podcast is a weekly show created by two lifelong comic book readers who offer suggestions on which comic books you should be reading each week. Each episode also dives into the latest developments for comics in video games, movies, and television shows. We'll even discuss comic book collectibles and anything we think you should know about that pertains to this entertainment medium.\nBe sure to subscribe to From Panel to Podcast on your favorite podcast platform. The show is available on Google Podcasts, Spotify, and Apple Podcasts.",

He seems to be using bananas on the bottom left to control his Tarnished’s movement while his right hand seems to use three bananas to control attacks and dodges. Of course, this is pure speculation because the official Banana control scheme for Elden Ring has not yet been released by From Software (we eagerly await the day, though). \nNews of SuperLouis_64 tropical feat comes just days after someone beat Elden Ring in under three hours without dying a singe time. In other news, I am not as good at Elden Ring as I thought I was, it seems. \nIf you need help in Elden Ring, Game Informer has you covered, though. Check out our guide on how to beat Godrick the Grafted and then read our guide on Elden Ring’s best rune farming location.
