          "description": "\"A unicorn is worth more than riches\".\nIn 2009, in the run-up to Christmas, I remember poring over a recent issue of Official Nintendo Magazine looking for games I might want for the holiday season. Flicking through the pages and taking in every single word, one review in particular jumped out at me. The art style was something I’d never seen in a video game before. I was obsessed with Japanese folklore at the time. And, even though the gameplay sounded like nothing new, it scratched my 2D action-platformer itch.\nThat review was for Muramasa: The Demon Blade, and this was my first brush with Vanillaware. My love of the Osaka-based developer, and this game in particular, is documented, but it was established at the very moment I saw Muramasa on the TV screen, with Edo Japan rendered in beautiful watercolour visuals. Vanillaware has always been known as the studio that makes pretty games with pretty food – and, sometimes, the studio that gives us, um, very exaggerated art – but over the past four years, I’ve seen a real shift in appreciation that I’ve been hoping for.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The first and perhaps most obvious reason is that consumers are desperate for information on the 'Switch 2', and Nintendo has previously stated that it will be officially announced before the end of March 2025. That means that once the New Year has come and gone, we can restart the hype machine with extra gusto.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

In yet another hollow display of solidarity and \"Liber-tea\", they've teamed up with the loathsome fascists of Killzone, the elderly shooter series from Sony and Guerrilla Games.\nFrom today, you'll be able to buy weapons, armour and cosmetics belonging to Killzone's despicable stormtroopers from the Helldivers Superstore, and there's the suggestion of an additional Killzone-themed reward depending on the fortunes of the so-called Galactic War, a xenocidal bloodbath couched as an exercise in bringing \"freedom\" to the upstanding socialist Automatons, the blameless wildlife of the Tyranids, and the Wellsian cosplayers of the recently added Illuminate faction.\nWe here at Rock Paper Shotgun stand against Super Earth and Arrowhead's wanton aggression, which absolutely isn't a big satirical joke based on some Verhoeven film or other. Anyway, those capes. Find an image and further details below.\r\n \nRead more",

Sin once described writing news articles for our former news editor Alice0 (RPS in peace) as like practising backflips in front of the kung fu master. Writing about a new city builder at Sin's suggestion is like being invited to budget the development of Londinium by Julius Caesar.\nThe terror of screwing it up - together with other, more trivial distractions, like international games industry conferences - has stopped me from writing about Times Of Progress for months. Today I bite the bullet, and emerge from my lodgings to issue a hesitant speech to the masses, hoping like hell that Caesar is too preoccupied with the latest Gaul uprising to notice my errors.\r\n \nRead more",

It's also struck a chord with me inasmuch as it's a new way into the culture of a sport which I have pretty mixed feelings about.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "A master thief creeps over cobbles in an early modern metropolis that splits the difference between Edinburgh, Glasgow and Liverpool. Lit by gaslamps that can’t quite dispel the industrial haze, they pass for a civilian - a rough one, admittedly, but not shady enough to cause an itch in the swordarm of any passing guard.\nUntil, that is, they take to the thieves’ highway - following the trajectory of their grappling hook upward to the rooftops, from which they can see the shape of the city, and the moon beyond. Up here, it’s a parallel world - the trees on street level answered by chimney stacks, and the distant hills echoed by the rise and fall of steep gables. “We’re super proud of these rooftops,” says Greg LoPiccolo. “It’s an amazing landscape that we put a lot of thought and effort into, and it’s a lot of fun to traverse.”\nBack in 1998, LoPiccolo was the game director who saw Thief: The Dark Project to completion. Today - after an 18 year detour to Harmonix to lead projects like Guitar Hero and Rock Band, among other adventures - he’s the game director of Thick as Thieves. “It really is an opportunity to do something unique and cool and new, on the shoulders of this stuff that is now well-respected,” he says. “Thief has some legs, right? People still talk about it to some degree.”\nRead more",

Fights are like if you took a MOBA and forced both teams to bash heads constantly. Success lies in picking off Spider-Man or Squirrel Girl or Marcus Fenix so as they wait to respawn, you hop on the big area that needs capturing. Or you push the cart while tanky Hulk absorbs bullets with his biceps and John Marvel snipes from afar.\nThe more I played Rivals, though, the more it hit me that it's specifically a messier, more complex Overwatch. A hero shooter with a surprising amount of polish and charm, sure, but also one that slides off my brain like water off Birdman's back. I understand why it's supremely popular at the moment and yet, I really don't.\nRead more",

          "description": "In more ways than one, today’s Total War: Warhammer 3 expansion marks a milestone for game director Rich Aldridge and his team at Creative Assembly. Omens Of Destruction’s three headline legendary lords each bring new campaigns and units for their respective factions, but it’s the fourth lord - a Khorne champion free to all players - that I imagine Aldridge will end up remembering the most fondly.\nWhen Total War: Warhammer released back in 2016, it shipped with eight legendary lords - famous characters from Games Workshop’s fantasy setting that here act as faction leaders. The number grew steadily and, in terms of announcement order at least, today’s addition of Arbaal The Undefeated marks the series’ 100th. That's a hundred campaigns, a hundred joint efforts of game design, animation, art, writing and voice work.\nAldridge has never been shy about the team’s ambition for the series to eventually offer up each unit from every Fantasy Battle 6th edition army book (\"The goal is to do everything, right?\"). But ambition is one thing, and considering the fraught conditions at Creative Assembly and parent company Sega over the past few years, it’s not just the addition of the 100th lord that feels like something to celebrate. It’s taken time, effort, and a siesmic shift in update frequency, but Total War: Warhammer III is in the best place it's ever been.\nRead more",

Sampling the demo, I was immediately enflamed by the orchestral score and placed in a mood of white-gloved sophistication only slightly spoiled by the familiarity of the underlying platform moveset, and by my repeatedly falling into pits. \n Read more",

The Past, Present & Future of Soul Reaver interviews key developers from the action adventure game, and about halfway through host Danny O’ Dwyer gets hold of some archive materials, including old audition tapes. These include Mark Hamill reading for Janos Audren, and Jennifer Hale for Ariel.\nThe biggest treat, of course, is hearing Hayter read for Raziel, especially as it’s that excellent opening monologue.

No, I'm not going to share pictures. You'll have to google that filth yourself.\r\n\n\r\nBut perhaps you are a sophisticated soul who has no time for such salacious nonsense.

It is systems within systems. It is a game in which you can, theoretically, plot the path of a single guided munition through an asteroid field, so as to catch an enemy cruiser in the back. I barely understand how to make a ship fire on another ship, using plain old armour-piercing shells, and now they're threatening to add carriers, fighters and bombers. Customisable ones!

It is a dusty brown, a damp brown, a hot and earthy brown that hums with the stinging malodour of disturbed ancient moss where once old forests stood. Descending into Gatwick’s cloying brown from 33,000 feet is like flying under and up Gandalf’s wretched cloak and landing in one of the several horrible little magic pouches he keeps by his balls.\nMicrosoft Flight Simulator 2024 captures Gatwick’s brown perfectly. Next to the stupefying natural beauty of Yosemite, the imposing imperial skyscrapers of the Manhattan skyline and the surging majesty of the Alpine peaks, this local rot-tinged patch of West Sussex is the most impressively realistic depiction of a place I have seen in a game.\nRead more",

          "description": "Among my last-resort tactics for generating precious PC gaming news is to go on holiday - for as sure as toast lands buttered side down while cats always land on their feet, as sure as the number 13 breeds calamity and Star Citizen committing to a release date guarantees a delay, myself going on holiday will always, somehow, conjure a big story from the crevices. It's basic physics. In this case, I was on holiday from Friday through Monday, and this fact and this fact alone appears to have coaxed some toy manufacturer into taking the internet's most cherished indie gaming platform offline by means of a \"bogus\" phishing report, sent by \"AI-powered\" brand protection software.\nThe situation has now been resolved, thankfully, and you can access Itch.io as normal, but I will never pass up the opportunity to cast shade on Funko Pop, whose NFT-garlanded bobbleheads I hate as I do veruccas and forest fires.

Early stages soon lose any real sense of surprise, and later ones can feel low on real agency. I want a new roguelike run to feel vital and verdant; heady with grand plans and plan-shattering twists.

He smiles with all the sleaze of right-hand-man Major Toht, the grubby gestapo who gets that right hand burned in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Yet he also engages in the pseudo-intellectual trash talk of the main archaeological rivals to Jones, like Rene Belloq or Walter Donovan. He is a hideous grab bag of all the things that make an instantly detestable villain in the series. But there's something else. Voss is so immediately and gutturally hateable because he resembles a type of racist encountered not in the 1930s, but one you've probably met today: the asshole you meet on the internet.\nWarning: Here be spoilers.\nRead more",

As one must when encountering horror media, the game and I immediately enter a spiritual staring contest, each of us knowing the real game here was it trying to freak me out. \"It’s fine\", I decided. \"It’s just a heart! I’ve got a heart. It’s actually very useful. Nothing to be scared of\". Thing is, Eclipsium’s menu heart is actually massive and sits, like The Eye Of Sauron, atop a giant obelisk. “Ah. That’s definitely a horror thing, that” I was forced to admit. \"If my heart was on a giant obelisk, I’d be proper shaken up, I reckon.\"\nSo starts Eclipsium’s very first bit of aggressive disorientation, and it basically just escalates from there. I obviously can’t describe the vibes without slightly spoiling the vibes, so do pop over to Steam for a demo if you’re curious and, oh, there’s a potted plant, the sound of its rustling mixed in such a way that it sort of sounds like it’s shrieking at me.

Of the co-op escape room games I've played, it was the best, both in terms of its relatively neutral framing (with little heavyhanded storytelling) and its pretty solid puzzle design. The game was expanded in the time since with a versus mode and several crossover DLC, and now there comes a sequel.\r\n\nEscape Simulator 2 will explore \"darker escape room themes\", looks visually more detailed, and comes with a new editor for those who wish to design their own escape rooms.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "The protagonists of two of my all time favourite RPGs share something in common. Both (the best Final Fantasy game) Final Fantasy 8’s Squall and The Witcher 3’s Geralt simply cannot get enough of leaving their friends and the entire world in mortal peril while they sneak in a quick round of cards, and I love them for it. Way back when the Wild Hunt released, there was a special edition kicking about that gave you a few decks for Gwent - the fleshed-out, playable card distraction that ended up being responsible for some of the game’s best moments. I pined for those decks, but I never acquired them. Now, Hatchette Board Games is putting out a full physical edition of Gwent next year.\nThe set contains \"over 400 cards and a playmat\" for £44/$39.99. I’m still recovering from various Fantasy Flight LCGs, so my value sense for this stuff might be a bit skewed, but that strikes me as incredibly reasonable. A good Gwent deck consists of only about 25 cards. They’re not bad cards, either! I’ve got a real pet hate for tabletop versions of videogames that just use in-engine screenshots for the cards, but these ones look to have the proper artwork from the game on them:\nRead more",

Why, I remember it like it was March, and not actually Summer, when the delightful free game about a mucky pomeranian was unleashed into the world. Yep, yep. It was definitely March. Roughly translating to ‘covered in mud doggy’, the game set you the task of racking up tangible financial damage to your owner’s house by getting mud everywhere - first by normal dog means, and then with giant mud cannons. You can grab it for free on Steam here.\nIt stole our hearts, it did. And talking of stealing things and having a good time doing it, it’s also releasing on the Nintendo Switch soon, which means the Steam version of Doronko Wanko is getting some free DLC to celebrate. It isn’t arriving until next Spring, but it’s bringing three new mystery dog breeds with it when it does.\nRead more",

The Intel Arc B580 graphics showed some nice generational uplift under Linux for most workloads but there were some anomalies where clearly the Intel Linux graphics driver had room to better optimize the new Xe2/Battlemage graphics support. Windows benchmarks of the Intel Arc B580 also showed it performing more competitively to the likes of the GeForce RTX 4060 compared to what I was seeing under Linux. Thus I spent the past few days working on some Windows 11 vs. Ubuntu Linux graphics benchmarks for both Intel Arc Graphics of Alchemist and Battlemage GPUs to see how the performance compares.",

If you didn't get a chance to find these fish last year, you have another chance to in 2024. \n\n\nAll Festive fish locations in Disney Dreamlight Valley\n\n\nDisney Dreamlight Valley's 2024 Winter event features five festive fish. You'll catch each fish by visiting their biomes and looking for red and green circles in the water. The regular white, orange, and blue colors will give you normal fish instead.\n\n\nBelow is every festive fish and their locations:\n\n\nFish\nLocation\n\n\n\n\nFestive Bass\nPeaceful Meadow\n\n\nFestive Fugu\nDazzle Beach (Raining)\n\n\nFestive Squid\nGlade of Trust\n\n\nFestive Salmon\nSunlit Plateau\n\n\nFestive Anglerfish\nForgotten Lands\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRather than fishing in white, blue, or orange circles like usual, you'll need to look out for sparkling red and green spots in the water. Aside from the changed color palette, the appearance and minigame that follows is the exact same. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nNonetheless, you're not guaranteed to find a fishing spot every time you check one of these biomes. They're not as rare as the Here and There fish, but they're still tough to encounter sometimes. If you're having trouble finding each fish, catch some from other circles and wait for more to respawn before repeating the process. Eventually, one of the circles will be red and green, signaling you're about to get your first festive fish.\n\n\nIf you've yet to complete the Even Fish Are Festive Dreamlight Village task, you'll progress through it with each festive fish you catch. Otherwise, obtaining more won't let you repeat the task, but you'll restore a ton of energy by eating them. Alternatively, you can use them in crafting recipes or cooking like you would with their regular counterparts.\n\nThe post All Festive fish locations in Disney Dreamlight Valley appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "PlayStation just released a brand-new gameplay trailer of Lost Soul Aside, which confirms that this unique action RPG that went viral in 2016 will come out on PlayStation 5 and PC next year. The fact that this game finally received a release window after 9 years of development is very exciting.\n\n\n\n\nLost Soul Aside combines hack-and-slash (Like Devil May Cry and Ninja Gaiden) games with RPGs (like Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts). These inspirations are immediately evident in the new gameplay trailer, which showcases the main character, Kazer, pulling off some fast, dynamic and impressive combos on a bunch of enemies. The combat is the main star of Lost Soul Aside, and after so many years of development, it now looks better than ever.\n\n\nThis new trailer also introduces a new female charact…",

          "description": "When you think of Winter celebrations in Fortnite, Mariah Carey appearing frozen in time probably wasn't on your 2024 bingo card. Whenever December begins, she takes the stage for her festive music. Let's find Mariah Carey's frozen self and figure out what's going on with Fortnite's Chapter 6 map.\n\n\nHow to find Frozen Mariah Carey in Fortnite Chapter 6\n\n\nDuring Mariah Carey's first introduction in Fortnite Chapter 6, she's encased in a massive ice block near Brutal Boxcars, Foxy Floodgate, and Seaport City. You'll find this ice block on top of a mountain, with candy canes dotting the path up to it. \n\n\nYou can't break it or defrost her, either. Instead, you'll have to wait for the ice to thaw and for Mariah Carey to appear as a POI. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nAlthough the date for Mariah Carey's ice block dethawing is not yet known, we suspect it'll happen a few days after her first appearance in Fortnite. Considering that her in-game skin will be released on December 20, the iceberg may thaw on the same date to celebrate.\n\n\nBeyond this, the ice block doesn't currently serve much purpose aside from alluding to Mariah Carey appearing in the game and giving you a spot to fight other players. There's a teleporting porta potty on top and at the bottom of the iceberg, giving you a way to travel between the two locations and several ice blocks containing treasure chests. Unlike Mariah Carey's ice, you can break these blocks, giving you some loot to help you in your match.\n\n\nMariah Carey's arrival is happening around the same time that Epic Games is introducing Skibidi Toilet into Fortnite. Mariah Carey makes sense, considering the festive season and potential for in-game shop content, but the Skibidi Toilet collab is slightly odd. Seeing her duking it out with these new characters will certainly make for some entertaining moments, especially if we get a random Goku or Peter Griffin in the mix.\n\nThe post Frozen Mariah Carey NPC location in Fortnite Chapter 6 appeared first on Destructoid.",

K písničkám z alba vyšly animované videoklipy, které produkoval Leidži Macumoto, což byl kultovní japonský výtvarník (zemřel loni), který měl na svém kontě mnoho animovaných seriálů, především ze 70. - 80. let (nejslavnější z nich byl asi \"Space Battleship Yamato\").
