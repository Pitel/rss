          "description": "It's Frogger, but emotional.\nThough 3D platformers often go down the collectathon route to varying success, it can be interesting to see new entries in the genre try something a little different. SCHiM is one such fresh title, eschewing a focus on cartoonish characters, wacky levels, and mountains of things to grab in favor of a semi-narratively driven adventure that just offers a beautiful, artful experience. SCHiM may not be the kind of game that’s ‘fun’ in the way that most other platformers are, but it’ll stick out as a memorable bright spot when you think back through the new releases you tried out this year.\nSCHiM’s story is told through a series of pantomimed cutscenes, leaving a lot of room for interpretation. You begin by playing as a shadow frog quietly following the adventures of a young boy enjoying his childhood, and you're right there with him as he rapidly grows up and experiences the various joys and hardships of life. After the poor dude gets dumped and loses his job in a round of layoffs, you're suddenly separated from him, leaving the young man without a shadow. Thus begins your long journey across the shadows of the world to make your way back to him.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Ho, wayfarer! Beware slight spoilers for Alan Wake 2 in the passages ahead.\n\r\nDeep in the Dark Place of Alan Wake 2 there is a forest that is not a forest - a zig-zag tunnel adorned with murals of a grisly woodland scene. Entering that tunnel, you find yourself sealed in at either end. But the mural suggests a way out: it changes when you turn around, following an unspoken narrative. It's a device as delicate as the graffiti elsewhere in the Dark Place is obnoxious. In hindsight, it feels like an example of \"metsänpeitto\", a concept from Finnish folklore about forests which, as writer Sinikka Annala explains, saturates the design of Alan Wake 2. It's a fascinating idea I'd love certain much larger, less intriguing video game worlds to learn from.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Well rejoice, perverted chalk-and-cheese mixers, because Roots of Yggdrasil now has a 1.0 release date - 6th September 2024.\n Read more",

He shouldn't have slept with the Queen's sister, for example. He shouldn't have insisted his lover subsequently pay him for a confession to absolve herself of the guilt accrued from sleeping with him. He shouldn't have felt safe in a room next to the Queen, a woman described as \"reckless\" in her character traits, and who is perilously close to having a nervous breakdown. This, my holy friend, is how your bed chamber becomes a raging inferno. \nBy the end of my first game of Norland, the village of Nandos (you can name your own settlements) is covered in more blood than the back end of the bard's best work. In storytelling terms, it is a tragedy. In terms of fantasy management games? It is great fun. The failure cascade as waterslide. \nRead more",

And what's frustrating is that I just don't get on with them, despite knowing that they can convey brilliant stories through all sorts of interesting cuts and shots and whatnot. I'm sorry to report that certain stories won't grab me if they're not ticking along at just the right pace or if they don't pull me in straight away. I'm a needy soul, someone who demands immediacy and a special emotional sauce.\nUntil Then is, without a doubt, the only visual novel-y game I've truly enjoyed. In fact, I'd say I've more than enjoyed it - I think it's superb so far. The teens that drive this story are written with an authenticity I've not encountered before, and the 3D interwoven with the 2D adds some surprising - besides the literal - depth.\nRead more",

Evidently, players did not sufficiently meet their demand for wanton Orc-massacring, for Robot were forced to release two sequels, which I personally would have titled Orcs Must Die!! and Orcs Must Die!!! or perhaps Orcs Must Die!!?, to indicate a mounting existential crisis.\nNow, Robot have stepped things up by announcing Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap, a newly roguelite, four-player spin on the goblin-farming formula, whose subheading throws bumbling Orc murderers a bone by specifying that you might try building a trap of some kind, a deathtrap possibly.

Provided you’ve got an Amazon Prime account, or at least the free Prime trial, the 512GB model can be yours for £569, a saving of £131. Not bad, for a device with a higher-rez display and more graphical horsepower than the Steam Deck or Steam Deck OLED.\nRead more",

A slime, in most games, is a squashy smiley face. Why, I could grow myself one of those right this very instant, by doodling a circle in MS Paint and squinting very hard. Slimes do take more complex forms - chrome slimes, fire slimes, slimes with angry eyebrows, etc - but come now, it's not on the same level as rebooting Lara Croft's hair to billow in the blowback from grenades.\nThe simplicity of slime creation may soon become a distant memory, however, for Epic Games tech artist and current Duck Shake Games Asher Zhu is hell-bent on reinventing the homely Dragon Quest sludgeball as a technical tour de force on par with his previous contributions to Unreal Engine showcase Matrix Awakens. That's the impression I garner from the below video of Zhu's latest project, anyway, whose description also tantalises with talk of \"Splatoon mechanics in dungeons\".\n Read more",

And in a mundane world of vibrant colour, you're to bounce between patches of shade in search of a human pal whose shadow you've been unwittingly severed from. What ensues is a charming puzzler of both freedom and flow, which genuinely has you view everyday environments through the googly eyes of a phantom amphibian.

Best not speculate.\nAnyway, Fallout London is a huge effort from modders Team Folon that was recently sabotaged when Bethesda treated Fallout 4 to a next gen update to capitalise on the Amazon TV show's popularity, rendering several mods incompatible and breaking a lot of stuff. Team Folon have now fiddled with the workings and sent a Fallout London build to GOG for QA testing, which suggests that release is imminent. The catch, however, is that you will need to downgrade your copy of Fallout 4 to play the mod, because even with Team Folon's last-minute adjustments, Fallout 4 next gen and Fallout London simply don't get on.\n Read more",

Like the lootbox hawkers of yesteryear, gacha designers understand the appeal and power of a pleasingly animated gizmo, ker-chunking open and fizzing with potential. This poppy visual and sonic language stretches across Hoyo's latest game, from its cinematic moments, to each character's attacks, to the cute bunny mascots that erupt into gatling guns, to the barista's coffee-making ritual and the recipes of the robo-limbed noodle server. The menu screens, the maps, the free-to-play storefront, everything. It is all very juicy. It is pumped with juice, but only in the same way supermarket chicken is pumped with water. \nRead more",

          "description": "The studio-killing fallout of Embracer's acquisition frenzy continues to fall like ash on the industry. The publishing giant has reportedly closed Piranha Bytes, the studio known for cult RPGs like Gothic, Risen, and Elex, according to a worker who spoke to Polish games site CD-Action. The studio's existence had been under threat since early this year, after being targeted in Embracer's purgatorial studio massacre. At that time the German studio were hopeful to avoid being closed down, insisting \"don't write us off yet!\" Unfortunately, it looks like those who worked at the studio have since been laid off.\nRead more",

          "description": "I gaze with alarm and approval upon the recent phenomenon of \"dark strategy\" or \"horror strategy\" games, a devilish parade of top-down drag-clickers, from The Fabulous Fear Machine to The Tribe Must Survive, that strive to find the fear in a genre that typically places you at a managerial remove. The best-known is probably Frostpunk, with its perpetual raging against the dying of the light, its ceaseless scrape for coal and wood as the temperature falls. Anoxia Station, announced this month, is similarly driven by the gathering of fossil fuels, and similarly shaped by questions of worker death and morale, but it takes you deep underground - into a sumptuous, brutal world of quartz crystals, salt caves, magma lakes, moonmilk rivers, swirling gases and, judging from the below trailer, enormous maggots and centipedes. Larva lakes, amirite.\n Read more",

          "description": "The Ukrainian city of Mariupol came under heavy bombardment during the opening months of Russia's invasion in 2022, a programme of artillery and air strikes that damaged or destroyed the majority of residential buildings and has killed or dispossessed thousands of people. It has now been occupied by Russia for almost two years, during which, as reported by the Associated Press, Russia has demolished, rebuilt and renamed much of the city, overwriting its Ukrainian heritage.\nThe Disco Elysium-inspired RPG Hollow Home is a memory of Mariupol from just before the war - not a 1:1 recreation, but a collection of details, colours, personalities and some familiar buildings, painstakingly amassed and offered up in the face of erasure. Speaking to me during a very brief demo at Digital Dragons in Poland this year, artist Anastasia Hlyniana called my attention to the plants jutting from old car tyres around the game's isometric map, which she says are a common sight in Mariupol.\n Read more",

Keep this in mind when pulling for her since the added incentive to keep pulling might affect you more than you realize.\n\n\nImage via HoYoverse\n\n\nIs Nilou worth pulling?\n\n\nNilou is worth pulling if you want to play pure Bloom teams.

          "description": "Ahead of 1999, players received the AX-52 assault rifle in Warframe. It’s a weapon that is much more than meets the eye, so if you’re looking for a solid build for the AX-52 to carry you through almost everything Warframe has to offer, look no further.\n\n\nBest AX-52 build in Warframe\n\n\nThe AX-52 is a strong automatic rifle that has a really high critical chance and multiplier. Its status chance is also something to not look past, especially since it only has Puncture as a damage type. Lastly, its passive ability gives you ammo efficiency when firing at the hip and a 100% critical chance bonus when aiming and hitting headshots.\n\n\nWith all that said, here’s a build to really make all of its strengths shine:\n\n\n\nVital Sense\n\n\nCritical Delay\n\n\nMalignant Force\n\n\nRime Rounds\n\n\nGalvanized Aptitude\n\n\nSerration\n\n\nGalvanized Chamber\n\n\nHunter Munitions\n\n\nExilus: Vigilante Supplies\n\n\nArcane: Primary Merciless\n\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nIf you do not have the Galvanized mods, you can replace them with the following:\n\n\n\nGalvanized Aptitude: Heavy Caliber, Hammer Shot, Rifle Elementalist, or Vigilante Armaments\n\n\nGalvanized Chamber: Split Chamber\n\n\n\nWith this mod setup, you’re heavily increasing all the stats above while also adding Viral and Slash to the mix of status procs dealt. It’ll be versatile across all factions, making this a critical machine that chews through armor and health. It'll only struggle a bit against Corpus shields, but it should still do just fine.\n\n\nWhat makes the weapon versatile is that it does great work whether you’re a good shot or not. \n\n\nIf you can’t trust yourself to hit headshots while aiming, then you can opt for hipfire. It won’t deal easy orange criticals, but the ammo efficiency will allow you to stack more viral, slash, and puncture procs onto enemies.\n\n\nEither way, you’re going to be softening up mobs by just spraying and praying with this mod setup. \n\nThe post Best AX-52 build in Warframe appeared first on Destructoid.",

Nilou’s ability to turn everyday Dendro Cores into potent bombs only works when her teammates are all Dendro or Hydro. So, given this strict team restriction, what are Nilou’s best teams?\n\n\nTeambuilding advice for Nilou\n\n\nNilou’s best teams are usually double Dendro, double Hydro. This means there should be a total of two Dendro characters and two Hydro characters, including Nilou herself. Having two of each element means you can trigger Bloom more often, resulting in more Dendro Cores and more explosions.

They come in timed drops with limited release availability, meaning collectors must be ready when they come out.\n\n\nThe Summer Superdrop ended this past week, meaning another drop is on the horizon, with many wondering what the theme may be this time.\n\n\nWell, wonder no longer. A video on the Secret Lair Twitter (or X) account has shown us what's coming with the next drop on July 29th. That's right, friends and fans, we're getting more adorable anthropomorphic Planeswalkers in a drop called Showcase: Bloomburrow.\n\n\n\n\nBloomburrow has already shown us several such Planeswalkers, many of which can be found either in the Bloomburrow Commander preconstructed decks or in the Collector Booster packs. Now we're getting more of them, printed in nice foil versions as well, for all those who want to add a touch of cuteness to their deck when building it.\n\n\nThere are five cards included in this drop, which are as follows:\n\n\n\nHuatli, Radiant Champion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKiora, Behemoth Beckoner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSorin Markov\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTezzeret, Master of the Bridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVraska, Goglari Queen\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will be part of a larger drop called Inside an Elevator, which also includes a collaboration between MTG and LA-based artistic collective Brain Dead. A few more goodies will also pop up before the release, but I think I've seen enough. I already loved Jace as a fox, but Vraska as a tiny little snake has won my heart.

PlayStation players could simply lend their game discs to a friend after completing it so that their friends could try the game out for themselves. The process to share digital games on the PS5 is obviously different, with no physical edition to simply hand over.\n\n\nTo allow players to share games with each other, Sony had the gameshare feature on PlayStation 4, and it is also available on PlayStation 5. However, it is called the “Console Sharing and Offline Play” feature on the PS5.\n\n\nRegardless of the name, the functionality remains the same. When you gameshare on PS5, it allows you to share your game library with a friend.\n\n\nKeep in mind that you can only gameshare with one friend only. Before dividing further into gameshare, it is also important to understand that this feature is primarily designed to allow any user to play games on a specific PS5 console.\n\n\nHow to enable gameshare on PS5\n\n\n\nLog in to your PSN account on your PS5.\n\n\nHead to Settings.\n\n\nGo to Users and Accounts.\n\n\nNavigate to the Other section.\n\n\nSelect Console Sharing and Offline Play. Select ‘Disable’ if gamesharing is already on for this console.\n\n\nLog out of your PSN account on your PS5.\n\n\nLog in to your PSN account on your friend's PS5 console.\n\n\nGo to the Console Sharing and Offline Play menu once again, and select ‘Don’t Disable’ option.\n\n\n\nThat’s it! Now you can play PlayStation games in your Library across these consoles.

          "description": "After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.\nJoin Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 1:00 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

The show’s second season premiered on Paramount+ earlier this year. \nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter’s sources, Halo showrunners Amblin, Xbox, and 343 Industries are seeking a new outlet for a potential third season, with Paramount reportedly supporting the move. \n“Paramount+ can confirm that ‘Halo’ will not move forward with a third season on the service,” Paramount said in a statement. “We are extremely proud of this ambitious series and would like to thank our partners at Xbox, 343 Industries and Amblin Television, along with showrunner and executive producer David Wiener, his fellow executive producers, the entire cast led by Pablo Schreiber as Master Chief and the amazing crew for all their outstanding work. We wish everyone the best going forward.”\nAfter years of development, Halo premiered on Paramount+ on March 24, 2022, and stars Pablo Schreiber as Master Chief. Season 1 received a mixed reception from critics and fans, with many lambasting it for deviating from the games’ established lore and characterizations. Season 2, which premiered earlier this year on February 8 and concluded on March 21, was received more positively, with several critics and viewers hailing it as a dramatic improvement. Season 1 currently sits at 70% on Rotten Tomatoes/61 on Metacritic. Season 2 garnered a 90% on Rotten Tomatoes/64 on Metacritic. \nFor our thoughts on Halo Season 1, check out our video reviews of each episode. You can also read our February interview with the showrunners about how they planned to make Season 2 feel more faithful to the games.",

          "description": "Skeleton Crew, the team behind the 2021 side-scrolling action game Olija, and Devolver Digital have revealed an intriguing new project: Forestrike. The game sports a unique premise: as a martial artist, you can foresee and simulate future combat encounters, allowing you to perfect your execution before laying a finger on anyone. \nThe fighter battles to free a captive Emperor from an evil Admiral, and doing so involves mastering Foresight, a meditative technique to mentally predict and play out battles before they unfold (for Dragon Ball fans, think of image training). Gameplay-wise, players are pitted against different combinations of enemy types. They use Foresight to play the battle in advance to find the optimal approach to defeating them while taking little to no damage.\nFor example, using Foresight may help you learn to dodge a charging enemy so they trample an ally, then finish him off by lobbing a nearby weapon. Determining the best approach may take several Foresight attempts, but once you have your strategy down, you then execute the battle in real-time. After winning a fight, a replay feature allows you to rewatch it using slow-motion and other editing tools to study your strategy or generally feel cool about your performance. \n\n\nUsing the Foresight makes Forestrike's combat feel puzzle-like in its execution, and winning fights as flawlessly as possible matters. That’s because you have limited health to fight through multiple stages in a roguelike-style branching map. Along the way, you’ll earn upgrades that carry over to future runs, as well as perks called Techniques that enhance your abilities. \nForestrike is a neat spin on the action genre, and it's slated to launch sometime in 2025 for Switch and PC.",

With its servers regularly buckling under the weight of its players, the game caught lightning in a bottle but petered out when the game finally went 1.0 and simultaneously ceased receiving support in 2022. Now, developer 1047 Games is back with Splitgate 2 and aims to refine the original's winning formula. \n\n\nLike the first game, Splitgate 2 will be a free-to-play 4v4 shooter that arms players with a portal gun and more traditional firearms to battle each other in aerial, dimension-hopping combat. The sequel is being built in Unreal Engine 5 and has a new emphasis on factions. Players can suit up to compete in the Sol Splitgate League as members of one of three groups: the agile Aeros, the time-manipulating Meridian, or the trigger-happy Sabrask. According to a press release, “Factions will grant players the ability to choose and progress based on their preferred gameplay style or competitive strategies.” Splitgate 2 will feature new objective-based game modes across new arenas and upgradable weapons. \nAdditionally, a special Splitgate 2 companion app is available to download now. The app lets players explore the game’s universe through collectibles that unlock in-game rewards when Splitgate 2 launches. It also features quizzes and a new comic series called Splitgate: The Games We Play. The five-issue series will flesh out the backstory of the characters featured in the announcement trailer and additional issues will arrive monthly. \nSplitgate 2 launches in 2025 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

Video game adaptations can be a bit of a mixed bag sometimes, but in this case, fans and critics alike (us included) loved its characters, world-building, and its overall take on the Fallout universe. It should come as no surprise, then, that the show has been nominated in numerous categories at the 2024 Emmy Awards.\nFallout was nominated in 16 categories, but two of them are particularly exciting. First, the show is one of eight nominees for Outstanding Drama Series, ranking it among other big shows of 2024, like Shōgun, which currently leads the pack with 25 nominations.

The only additional context we got was the hashtag #WhoIsEmio, leaving fans scrambling to figure out what exactly this was hinting at.\nToday, that mystery has been cleared up. Emio, also known as \"The Smiling Man,\" is the star of a new game in the Famicom Detective Club series, which hasn't had a new entry in 35 years. The game was revealed today alongside a video featuring series producer Yoshio Sakamoto, who wrote the first two games and went on to direct titles like Super Metroid and Metroid: Zero Mission. According to him, they decided to make this new entry during their time developing the Famicom Detective Club remakes back in 2021.\n\"In Emio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club, a student has been found dead in a chilling fashion, his head covered with a paper bag with an eerie smiling face drawn on it,\" a press release reads. \"This unsettling visage bears a striking resemblance to a recurring clue in a string of unsolved murders from 18 years ago, as well as Emio (the Smiling Man), a killer of urban legend who is said to grant his victims 'a smile that will last forever.'\" Players will assume the role of a private investigator and set out to solve the case and stop the killer for good.\nEmio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club will be released for the Nintendo Switch next month, on August 29. Hopefully, the titular killer won't murder too many people before then.\nAre you excited to see this series revived? Let us know in the comments!",

Amid a wave of price reductions and other end-of-life updates, nostalgic fans can relive the console's earliest days via a new dynamic background modeled after the old “Blades” interface.\nFor those too young to remember or didn’t get an Xbox 360 until years later, the Blades interface was the console's first dashboard design. It was the first thing players saw from the console’s launch in 2005 until it was updated to an entirely different interface in 2008. Navigating it felt smooth as butter, and some diehards still believe it's the best UI of any Xbox console. \nAlthough it's less detailed, and you can’t flip through the Blades of this dynamic background and hear that satisfying “whoosh” sound, it’s nice to see Microsoft acknowledge the 360's like this. Here’s how you to make the Blades your Xbox background:\nPress the Xbox button on your controller to open the guide.\nNavigate to Profile & system > Settings > General > Personalization > My background > Dynamic backgrounds.\nChoose Xbox 360 Blades under Featured or Xbox dynamic backgrounds\nSelect the background art you want using the A button.\nYou can read more about the impending Xbox 360 store closure and final updates by visiting this Xbox Wire article.",

          "description": "Dead by Daylight’s 8th-anniversary stream revealed a few big updates for the popular asymmetrical horror game. The most immediate is the addition of Lara Croft as the game’s latest crossover survivor along with the impending addition of the much-requested 2v8 mode. \nTomb Raider Chapter\nLara Croft (the 2013 reboot version, specifically) joins DBD today, and though she lacks her pistols and bow, she sports three new perks highlighting her adventuring prowess. Here's an explanation of each per DBD's website:\nFinesse: Your fast vaults are faster when healthy, with a cooldown after a successful use.\nHardened: When you open a Chest and cleanse or bless a Totem, Hardened activates for the duration of the Trial. From that point, every time you scream, you’ll instead reveal the Killer’s Aura.\nSpecialist: When you open or rummage through a Chest, gain 1 Token (up to 3). When you do a Great Skill Check, consume a Token to reduce the max required Generator progress.\n\n\n2v8 Mode\nOn July 25, a new 2v8 multiplayer mode descends into the game. This pits two Killers against eight survivors in expanded versions of five classic maps. The number of generators has been doubled, and Survivors must now repair 8 out of 13 to escape. Captive Survivors are now sent directly into cages, and Survivor perks have been reworked into a new role system designed to encourage teamwork. \n\n\nCross-Progression\nCross-progression is being implemented on July 22. This means players can now sync their progress across multiple owned versions of the game. Everything can be shared across any platform except for Switch, which has a few restrictions as you can see in the chart below. \nToday’s stream also revealed a new trailer and the release date for The Casting of Frank Stone, the single-player DBD game developed by Supermassive Games (Until Dawn, The Quarry). You can read all about that here.",

This intriguing horror collaboration will arrive on September 3, and a new trailer provides a proper introduction of the main cast. \nDeveloped by Supermassive (Until Dawn, The Quarry) and published by Dead by Daylight developer Behaviour Interactive, The Casting of Frank Stone stars five teenagers – Christine Gordon, Jaime Rivera, Linda Castle, Robert Green, and Bonnie Rivera – who film their own horror movie in an abandoned steel mill. Unfortunately, this mill has ties to a notorious murderer named Frank Stone, and the youth’s innocent art project goes horribly wrong.\n\n\nWe still don’t know much about the narrative other than that it is set within the world of Dead by Daylight and takes place in the town of Cedar Mills during the summer of 1980. Gameplay-wise, The Casting of Frank Stone follows a similar blueprint to Supermassive’s previous horror titles in that it’s a choice-driven adventure where characters can be permanently killed off based on your decisions. You can check out a recent gameplay trailer here to see it in action. \nThe Casting of Frank Stone is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

The game was first announced last September. \nA Heartful of Games is developing the game, which retains the stylized Spider-Verse-inspired art direction from the hit film. The story unfolds after the movie's events and sees Leo, Raph, Donny, and Mikey battling a new wave of mutants invading New York City. \n\n\nAs previously covered in our exclusive preview earlier this year, Mutant Mayhem is a third-person action/platformer game, and each turtle features a unique playstyle. The game also supports up to two-player local co-op. \nTMNT: Mutants Unleashed launches on October 18 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. The game is also getting a fancy Collector Edition, and you can see the contents of that here. Mutants Unleashed is one of several TMNT games to arrive in recent years (and the third in 2024 alone, following Wrath of the Mutants and the Switch port of Splintered Fate), and you can read all about the franchise’s history in video games in our in-depth retrospective.",

          "description": "Mortal Kombat 1’s final Year 1 DLC fighter arrives next week, and it’s Takeda Takahashi. The young Shirai Ryu warrior makes only his second appearance in a Mortal Kombat game and looks every bit as capable as his older clanmates, Scorpion and Smoke. \nAlthough Takeda was Kenshi’s son in his debut appearance, Mortal Kombat X, the remixed timeline of Mortal Kombt 1 has changed him to Kenshi’s cousin. Like Kenshi, Takeda grew up a Yakuza but was more faithful to the clan than his cousin. As such, the Yakuza tasked Takeda with killing Kenshi, and the two battled, with the latter coming emerging victorious. Takeda was mortally wounded in the battle and rushed to the aid of the Shirai Ryu, where Kenshi protected him from being killed by the Yakuza for failing his mission. This causes Takeda to have a change of heart and join the Shirai Ryu to wage war against Earthrrealm’s criminal underground and, eventually, the evil forces of Outworld. \nTakeda still utilizes the Shirai Ryu fighting style, including his signature pair of bladed whips. He also sports shurikens, a barrage of teleporting flame attacks, and an aerial grapple best described as mid-air corkscrew piledriver. Check Takeda out below.  \n\n\nTakeda will be available on July 23, both as a standalone purchase and as a free download for Kombat Pack owners. The same day also sees previously revealed Kameo fighter Ferra become available to buy. Both Takeda and Ferra will be playable for the first time during Evo 2025 this weekend. \nFor more on Mortal Kombat 1, check out our review as well as the trailers for previous DLC fighters Homelander, Omni-Man, Ermac, Peacemaker, and Quan-Chi.",

          "description": "The Double Dragon series has been around since the arcades in 1987 and has managed to maintain a surprisingly consistent release cadence in those more than 35 years. It was only last year that we played Double Dragon Gaiden, a pixelated throwback brawler (or belt-scroll action game, per its official YouTube description) take on the franchise.\nThis next entry is decidedly more modern, with fully 3D visuals. It's not the first time the series has explored this dimension, but it is a rare occurrence. The game is being developed by Yuke's, the developer that worked on the WWE 2K franchise until 2K19 and most recently developed AEW: Fight Forever. It is being published, or presented by, as the trailer implies, Arc System Works, the developer behind Guilty Gear and Dragon Ball FighterZ.\nDouble Dragon Revive is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and One, and PC sometime in 2025.\n\n\nFor a whole lot more on Double Dragon, but maybe not the version of Double Dragon you're thinking, head here to read all about the 1994 movie. Back in 2019, I tracked down the film's director, James Yukich, to talk about the bizarre film's trajectory, what went wrong, and what he would have done differently had he been giving a chance to try making the film again.",

We were customizing a feminine Rook, and while adjusting body options - read Game Informer’s in-depth feature about Veilguard’s character creator here for more details – our Rook's shirt disappeared to let us customize things like chest size. \nAnd that's when Veilguard game director Corrine Busche smiled, likely knowing full well that nudity in the character creator means nudity elsewhere in the game, like in Veilguard's romances, something I know BioWare fans will be delighted to hear. \"This is a mature RPG,\" she tells me.\nI only see topless nudity in the character creator, and when I later as…",

And later this year, there will be a handful of price increases for various tiers. Here's the exact text as it is presented on Microsoft's website.\nStarting July 10, 2024, the following updates to Xbox Game Pass will take effect:\n    Price changes will go into effect for new members for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, Xbox Game Pass Core, and PC Game Pass.\n    Game Pass for Console will no longer be available for new members.\n    Members who are already subscribed to Game Pass for Console and have automatic payment renewal enabled will be able to continue to enjoy their membership.\nAlso, a new Game Pass option, Xbox Game Pass Standard, will become available in the coming months. These changes will enable us to bring members more value and more great games to Game Pass.\nThe new Xbox Game Pass Standard tier for new members will be $15 a month and will not include access to Day One releases, EA Play, Game Pass for PC, and cloud gaming.\nXbox Game Pass Ultimate, which includes access to all the bonuses now not included in the Standard tier is increasing its price from $17 a month to $20.\nXbox Game Pass Core, which offers online access and a much smaller library of curated games, is changing its yearly from $60 to $75. The $10 monthly price for that tier, however, will remain unchanged.\nPC Game Pass is increasing from $10 per month to $12, but that tier will still include Day One releases.\nAll of these price changes will be reflected starting on September 12.\nPrice changes for services you already pay for are always frustrating. What do you think of the change? Do you plan on maintaining your subscription? Or is it time to cancel?",

Dubbed \"Tekken 8 x Nike Air Foamposite One Fist,\" these shoes will be available through Nike, SNKRS, and select retailers in-store and online for $250, as reported by Sole Retriever. \nThe shoes themselves are inspired specifically by Tekken 8's primary antagonist, Kazuya Mishima, as the colorway of the shoe is basically a spin on his outfit in-game. Sole Retriever describes the shoes as featuring an iridescent Foamposite material across the design's upper region in armory navy, with a faux crocodile skin texture across the Foamposite material, and black hues over the leather eyestays, shoe collar, and tongue. \nCheck out the Tekken 8 x Nike Air Foamposite One Fist shoes for yourself below: \n\nAs you can see, the shoes also feature the Tekken logos, a Fist logo with Tekken's signature lighting, and a nice box to hold the shoes. \nSole Retriever reports that a second colorway in this lineup is on the way and it will reference Jin Kazama, although there's no images of what it will look like yet. \nThese Tekken 8 x Nike Air Foamposite One Fist shoes will cost you $250 when they release this September.

Who thought hip-hop would take it this far?\nAs we celebrated the 50th anniversary of hip-hop last year, it’s now a good time to look back at how ingrained hip-hop music is in gaming, from NBA2K (remember that 2K13 soundtrack curated by Jay-Z?), Mortal Kombat, and Need for Speed, to Cyberpunk 2077 and, of course, Fortnite.\nMortal Kombat 11 came out of the gates in 2018 with a fiery trailer featuring music by 21 Savage, and later Megan Thee Stallion live-streamed an MK11 match on Twitch.

Just within the character creator, there are hundreds of options to customize things like hair, body type, what your playable character Rook's face looks like, and so much more. There are also a ton of armor options, too. \nCompanions have an armor slot, a ring slot, an accessory slot, and a weapon slot, while Rook has access to even more – a helmet, two weapon slots, a belt, an amulet slot, and two ring slots. A belt having its own slot might sound odd as it's not an armor piece people typically think of when kitting out an RPG warrior. However, the belt is an important facet of Rook's kit.

In the Resident Evil 4 (RE4) VR port, all it takes is lifting the controller in the air at the right time.\nAnd it’s always satisfying.\nThe parry mechanic is one of the novel additions of the 2023 remake developed by Capcom. Whenever a bolt or melee attack from an infected villager is about to impact Leon Kennedy, you only need to press a button to deflect with the in-game knife. This action grants an opportunity to follow up with an attack on the spot while simultaneously adding to RE4’s original close-quarter smackdown.\nAdapting this to the PlayStation VR2 wasn’t easy. Instead of Leon doing a swift animation with just a button press, you need to grab the knife from your chest, lift it up in the air, and match the incoming attack. I…",

In the wake of such a weird cultural moment, I’m certainly not the only one left wondering how the dust settles, especially as it relates to how we meet up, build friendships and relationships, and socialize. If you’re a gamer, answering those questions requires an additional layer of complexity since we spend much of our free time in virtual worlds.

Owners of these games will still be able to play their single-player content, but online support for these titles will end on November 7. The embedded announcement post on X also includes a link to an FAQ to answer additional questions about the sunsetting process. \nhttps://t.co/2W8dLlGjBM\nJune 28, 2024\nWhile the digital PS3/Xbox 360 versions of these games are going away, Battlefield 3 will still be available to purchase on PC. The same is true for Battlefield 4 and Hardline, and these two titles will also remain on sale for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The PC/PS4/Xbox One versions will remain unaffected by today’s updates.\nIt never feels good to see games get removed from sale like this. The reason likely has to do with EA sunsetting online support; it wouldn't be right to continue selling games with popular online modes if that component doesn't work anymore. For those still logging into Battlefield matches on PS3 and 360, you've got a few more months to enjoy the ride.\nFor more on Battlefield, you can learn about how the next entry is shaping up (which is being made with help by Dead Space remake developer Motive Studios) here.",

And it continues to look like a scary new addition to the A Quiet Place movie universe. \nThough there's still no release date – it's launching sometime this year on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC – this story trailer reveals more about the state of the world in The Road Ahead. It seemingly begins on Day One, when the aliens, which possess incredible hearing that requires people to remain silent to survive, attack Earth. It then jumps ahead to Day 105, with Alex, an asthmatic college student trying to survive the end of the world with her boyfriend Martin, on the hunt for supplies and more. \nCheck it out for yourself in the story trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead below: \n\n\nAs you can see, it seems Alex might be pregnant, which, if you've seen the first A Quiet Place movie, can make trying to remain silent in this world quite difficult. We'll have to wait a little longer to find out how the story of A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead plays out because it launches later this year on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. \nFor more about the game, watch the reveal trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead. \nAre you excited for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead?
