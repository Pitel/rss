Who else here — of drinking age, that is — has bought a red wine to accompany dinner, because it \"goes well with pasta\"? How many times have you been poured a glass of wine to \"taste\" in a fancy restaurant, going through the whole rigmarole of smacking your lips together and saying \"oh yes, lovely\" even though it just tastes like wine? And, be honest now, do you do that thing where you try a new wine and then try to guess the random assortment of fruits on the label to show off in front of your friends? \"Oh, yes, plum, see, I did mention stone fruits, didn't I, Janice?\" Yeah, we're all the same, and we all have no idea what we're talking about.\nBut here's something I do know about: Video games. I've been doing this job for a while now, and I've played quite a few of them. I am no sommelier of digital media, mind you, but I'm definitely knowledgeable enough to be able to recommend you a hearty, robust RPG or a nice indie palate-cleanser, depending on your taste. But I would like to propose a change to the way we talk about games, at the risk that it's going to make me sound like the kind of person that won't shut up about wine.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It's the world's most popular sport, so news that Mario Strikers: Battle League has already overtaken lifetime sales of Mario Golf: Super Rush in Europe less than a month after release may not come as a massive surprise, even if Super Rush has been out for over a year. We're big golf fans here at Nintendo Life — any excuse to wear loud trousers — but of course a football game is going to do better! Being based in the UK, we're legally required to love football more than any other country. Except that's not true, if physical European sales of Mario's latest kickaround are anything to go by.\nAccording to GSD (Games Sales Data) physical sales figures from GameIndustry.Biz's June report, it's not the UK but France who has demonstrated the lion's share of the soccer love on the European continent — at least where Mario is concerned — with 40% of all physical copies sold so far going into the hands of French football (and Switch) fans.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Taking the Zelda formula into space.\nZelda games have laid out a comfortable roadmap for developers to follow when making action-adventure games, and there's no shortage of Zelda-likes to enjoy on Switch and elsewhere. Tiny Roar evidently took heavy notes from Nintendo’s storied franchise when putting together XEL, which takes cues from both classic and modern Zelda titles and places them in a beautiful sci-fi setting that, at first glance, is perfect for exploring. Unfortunately, there are some serious technical issues with the visuals on Switch that hold it back from reaching its full potential.\nXEL follows the story of Reid, a wise-cracking spaceship pilot who crash-lands in a strange environment with no memory of her past or even her name. She is quickly joined by Chap, a silent robot floating companion who encourages her to look around this strange new land. The world is bright and colourful, giving a beautiful glimpse into a world of advanced technology that has been reclaimed by nature.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Although this is a sharp drop from the 104,315 units sold during its launch week, this is still a solid figure for the latest entry to the Monster Hunter franchise.\nElsewhere, there's not a lot to highlight here. The only new addition is KLONOA Phantasy Reverie Series, which lands at the half way point at number five.

          "description": "Insert coin.\nSince there’s little 'wrong' with Capcom Arcade 2nd Stadium, what’s right with it will depend on the sensibilities and interests of the player. The second of Capcom’s superbly curated compilations following on from Capcom Arcade Stadium, its 32 arcade titles (one of which is free) now feature a greater emphasis on action and fighting games. As before, you can buy the complete bundle pack or download the frontend and purchase titles individually.\nEverything runs silky smooth, lag-free, and is presented as a scrollable strip of tantalisingly jumbled-up arcade cabinets. The interface is attractive and highly customisable, with difficulty adjustments, auto-fire options, abundant wallpaper bezels, and the ability to order games by genre. Like the previous release, you can refashion your arcade by individually changing the look of each cabinet. The external view option, too, is intriguing, drawing out to reveal the mock machine’s housing. It’s not the most efficient way to play, nor does it work well on anything except a large TV screen, but it’s pretty cool nonetheless.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

While some good discounts vanished overnight (Prime Day is in fact two days, July 12th and 13th), the majority will keep running until the clock strikes midnight. To save you the bother of sifting through a mighty mountain of bargain bin junk, I've been collecting agreeable Amazon deals on actually good PC hardware right here.\nUnlike the kinds of offers you’d find during, say, Black Friday, all the best Prime Day offers are only available to Amazon Prime subscribers. If you don't have a membership, you could always sign up for Prime's 30-day free trial - more on that in our guide to everything you need to know about Prime Day, which you can also find further down. Here's some tips on how to find the best Prime Day deals for yourself, too.\nRead more",

That means some prices are back to normal, some aren’t, and the entire concept of a deal becomes kind of nebulous and squishy. And yet, there will undoubtedly be people out there desperate for a new graphics card – any new graphics card – so let’s take a look at what’s out there.\r\n\n\r\nThe bad news is that the vast majority of Prime Day GPU “deals” still reach above the respective card’s original retail price. The good news is that I’ve found a small handful of offers that are, if nothing else, good value by the incredibly whacked-out standards of the past two years. First up, there are a couple of Nvidia GeForce RTX 30 series cards worth considering in the UK, including an MSI-made RTX 3070 (that Ebuyer have price matched). Sticking with RTX cards, which can run both DLSS and DLAA, GameStop have a reasonable RTX 3060 deal for US buyers.\r\n\n \nRead more",

You do not need to prize open your powerwasher with a tri-wing screwdriver or manage your finances via a convoluted banking app or determine whether a kitchen sink delivers enough pressure. Instead, you wash things with power: you power wash. You wash, powerfully.\nAfter a year in early access, the game's launching in full with a variety of modes and I cannot stress enough how stress-less the experience is.

To me, the Steam Deck did not do anything not already covered by the four different video game boxes I already own. The largest advantage afforded by the Steam Deck, the ability to play cool games on a handheld device, was surely the domain of the Nintendo Switch - a console that I personally use about once a year. Usually the process is that I go \"Oh yeah!\", pick up the Switch, and contemplate buying Breath Of The Wild before I see that it has not depreciated in value whatsoever since it came out five years ago. Then I turn off the Switch. \nLast week, though, I picked up the Switch, saw that Tangle Tower was on sale, and played it through in one go. \"This is great!\", I thought, marvelling at how I could play a game while sitting on the sofa, but leaving the TV free for my partner to watch whatever stupid TV show he wanted. I went to look for other cool indie games that might be on sale on the Switch, and that's when I discovered that the Switch eshop is hot garbage unless you know specifically what you're looking for. So now I want a Switch.\nRead more",

Naturally, curiosity got the better of me, so I dipped my toe back in to see what teenage Katharine had been blogging about in the mid to late 00s. Aside from all my custom images having been eaten, probably with the closure of whatever photo upload service I used back in the day, everything else was pretty much in tact. \nBut man alive. Those OPINIONS. Just terrible. Bad, awful, narrow-minded. In some ways it's quite funny looking back at how angry I was about Nintendo putting trains in a Zelda game, for example (joke's on me, Spirit Tracks would go on to become one of my fav Zelda games of all time), but in many ways I'm just quite glad I've (hopefully) moved on as a person, if only because recent weeks have reminded me there are still plenty of people out there like late 00s Katharine who are in all likelihood the same age I am now.

          "description": "Monster Hunter has always been a series I've admired from afar. Like that smiling face with a tear running down one cheek emoji, I've watched friends discuss the trials and tribulations of a great Tigrex hunt and watched YouTube videos breaking down all the cool things you can do with the Insect Glaive.\nSo, with Monster Hunter Rise netting itself a bestest best badge and its Sunbreak expansion getting some serious praise in our review, I thought it was time to pull up my regular socks in the hopes that I could replace them with a pair woven from a big lizard's gooch. And I think I'm enjoying it? I think those socks could be mine? I just need to stop my brain from short-circuiting first.\nRead more",

          "description": "Madison is a fun game to write about. It's a puzzle horror game set in your traditional haunted house, aiming at a P.T. or Layers Of Fear vibe down the viewfinder of a Polaroid camera. Said camera was a second-hand gift for Luca's (that's you!) 16th birthday. It is also possessed by a demon, which is where the fun comes in, \"fun\" here meaning jump scares and hallucinatory clocks. Let that be a lesson to anyone thinking of getting their son something that was evidence in a murder as a present. This is one of many bad choices characters in Madison made. They are mostly now dead.\nThe game itself sometimes makes very good choices, though it's about 50/50 that it goes a bit too weird and ends up being silly. This makes for an intriguing mixture, especially with a complicated story of murder and neglect spanning decades, and by the end I was extremely fond of the way the sublime and the ridiculous sat side by side. The main let down isn't that Madison sometimes makes you giggle by accident, but that its multi-stage puzzles become so drawn out that you stop jumping at creepy angels and terrifying violin squeals. You've got numbers to write down and candles to move, and you don't have time for any demonic antics right now, godammit.\nRead more",

          "description": "Back in the mists of time, I actually had a hands on with Ubisoft's pirate 'em up Skull And Bones once. In my memory of it, I was an adolescent, which was categorically not the case and probably more a product of the booths at Gamescom being very tall, not to mention the hands on taking place so very long ago. At that time, the game was essentially the naval combat bit from AC: Black Flag, carved out and extended to be its own thing. Now, years later and with many delays and reworks bobbing about in its wake, Skull And Bones is back, and looking a bit different.\nThe current state of play for Skull And Bones was revealed with a livestream tonight, featuring an explainer video walking you through some of the game features, a chonk of the game in piratical action, and a surprisingly close release date confirmation for the 8th of November 2022 (there's still time for it to be delayed again!). All those extra months in the oven have produced a decidedly Sea Of Thieves-shaped bun. But this one is all realistic and gritty, more complicated, and is taking itself seriously. You won't catch Skull And Bones announcing its new season features with a comedy song, that's for sure.\nRead more",

Emmanuele Bassi v zásadě souhlasí, X11 už nedostává žádnou novou funkcionalitu a framework GTK se již delší dobu architektonicky posouvá směrem k Waylandu, jeho API se tak běhu na X11 stále vzdaluje. Dodává také, že řeči jsou jedna věc, ale pokud kód [podpory X11] nikdo nenapíše, tak prostě nebude.",

Iron Galaxy announced today that Rumbleverse will launch on August 11 for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, and PC via Epic.\nThe free-to-play brawler goes live on the 11th, and a week later the first season of Rumbleverse will kick off. According to Iron Galaxy's blog, this will include a Battle Pass with cosmetics to earn along a special path.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suOmxeeyRsI\nRumbleverse is a 40-player battle royale-style game. But rather than guns and shooting, Rumbleverse is about good ol' fashioned wrestling. Characters can pick up and use various moves like strikes, kicks, uppercuts, and giant slams to knock out opponents.\nAnnounced in December during The Game Awards 2021, Rumbleverse was set to launch in February. Iron Galaxy delayed the launch though, and has been running tests and early playtimes. Now, it seems like the fighter's ready to head into the ring.\nBah gawd\nIt's been hard to miss Rumbleverse, as it's been making the rounds in the fighting game community social sphere with each new playtest. And I'll admit, the concept has me intrigued. Plenty of battle royale games hone in on accuracy and shooting ability, but very few have sated the brawling, fighting, wrasslin' urge.\nThere have been several battle royales that have gone into and out of the spotlight over the years, but this one at least seems worth a test drive. At the low, low price of free, why not?\nRumbleverse slams onto PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and PC via the Epic Games Store on August 11.\nThe post Grappler royale Rumbleverse launches into the ring in August appeared first on Destructoid.",

Joined on the journey by pals Splinter, April O'Neil, and an unlockable Casey Jones, our heroes in a half-shell battle it out in colorful and chaotic arcade action. It's good old-fashioned fun for one-to-four players, and a must-buy for any fan of the enduring TMNT franchise.\nTMNT: Shredder's Revenge is available now on PS4, PC, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.

          "description": "It's going to be 'intense'\nAnother Aliens video game is in development, this time at Survios, the VR-centric studio behind games like Raw Data, Creed: Rise to Glory, and The Walking Dead Onslaught.\nThe studio hasn't announced the name yet, but says the game will fall into the single-player, action-horror camp, which is something I can vaguely latch onto. Vaguely. It's another \"original storyline, set between the Alien and Aliens ﬁlms,\" in which a \"battle-hardened veteran has a vendetta against the Xenomorphs.\" Alien Islolation 2 this is not.\nBuilt in Unreal Engine 5 for PC, consoles, and VR platforms, the Aliens game \"will take full advantage of Survios’ expertise in creating immersive and authentic gaming experiences.\"\nMore details at SDCC\nWith only some Xenomorph artwork to go on for now, we'll have to wait until San Diego Comic-Con to learn more. Survios will share more details during the Alien: Expanding a Dark and Frightening Universe panel at SDCC next Thursday, July 21 at 2:00 p.m. Pacific.\n\"The vast universe of Alien is full of untold stories, and opportunities to create gripping original games,\" said Luigi Priore, vice president, Disney, Pixar, and 20th Century Games. \"We're thrilled to work with a team like Survios who shares our passion for Alien.\"\nThe studio is very much staffing up, hence this early, detail-light game announcement.\nFor all of the effort so far, I feel like the Aliens series hasn't been able to capture lightning in a bottle lately, and I'm not convinced that'll change anytime soon. Another upcoming game, Aliens: Dark Descent from Tindalos Interactive, is a squad-commanding real-time action game. Could be good! Or it could be another one that pads out the list.\nAt least with VR in the picture, we might get some adrenaline-pumping moments.\nThe post A new Aliens action-horror game is in the works at Survios, and it’s single-player appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "This game led to another rebirth of Square Enix JRPGs\nThe fourth Octopath Traveler anniversary is upon us, seeing as the original release was back on July 13, 2018.\nSquare Enix is celebrating with a tweet, reminding us of the four-year anniversary, and providing a \"commemorative illustration\" of the crew from a member of producer Tomoya Asano's team: Tatsuaki Urushihara. They also remind folks that Live a Live is coming out later this month. So while we haven't gotten a direct sequel yet in the west (a mobile prequel called Champions of the Continent came out in 2020 in Japan, and is coming soon elsewhere), it's impacted many other projects since its launch, and has shifted Square Enix's priorities as a whole.\nOctopath Traveler can be considered a bird of a feather with several other modern pushes for JRPGs within the company. One of the bigger waves involved Bravely Default, which came roaring in during 2012, and reminded people that yes, there is an audience for the genre still. There was another wave in 2016 with I Am Setsuna, which ushered in the creation of Tokyo RPG Factory, and led to Lost Sphear, and Oninaki.\nThe legacy of Octopath itself (amid this Octopath Traveler anniversary) is directly responsible for the existence of Triangle Strategy, as well as numerous other games in that same style. Square Enix even cited Octopath Traveler's aesthetic choice as an influence and drive to bring Live a Live back in the form of a remake.\nhttps://twitter.com/OCTOPATH_PR/status/1547049576506736640\nThe post Octopath Traveler is celebrating its fourth anniversary, and it’s worth remembering appeared first on Destructoid.",

The giant RPG will launch on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One both physically and digitally on Sept. 29, as well as Nintendo Switch via cloud.\nWrath of the Righteous will also be available on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, via backward compatibility. Once the console version launches, the Enhanced Edition of Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous will become the standard version, and PC owners will all get that version for free on Sept. 29.\nOwlcat has also announced that The Treasure of the Midnight Isles, the third DLC for this Pathfinder, launches on August 11. This new adventure heads to the Midnight Isles, where horrors and terrors abound. There's both a standalone rogue-like mode and campaign option available, allowing players to experiment with builds and party compositions if they'd like. Even if a party dies, its progress can help future playthroughs.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlJzR7vcmFs\nThe Treasure of the Midnight Isles will be available either as a separate purchase, or as part of the season pass.\nMany stories to tell\nPathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous is, by all accounts, a massive RPG. It's got a somewhat-daunting amount of content, not all too dissimilar from other isometric RPGs. But if you're looking for a console RPG to eat up your time, you could probably do worse. Impressions of the PC version seem mostly positive, and there's even more on the way with the Midnight Isles DLC.\nOwlcat, meanwhile, is also forging on to a new franchise. Last month's Warhammer Skulls festival showcase confirmed that Owlcat is creating a Warhammer 40K CRPG, Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader.\nThe post Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous ventures onto consoles this September appeared first on Destructoid.",

Attendees will be able to check out the upcoming fighter live on location at Mandalay Bay.\nWhile trial sessions of Street Fighter 6 have been mostly confined to the press and/or Capcom's best buddies, the publisher is now beginning to drip-feed access to the public at several upcoming events, such as the aforementioned EVO and the incoming San Diego Comic-Con (SDCC). I would not be surprised if, much like with Street Fighter V, we don't also see some form of closed or open beta rolling out as we exit summer and enter the fall season.\nhttps://twitter.com/EVO/status/1547219490508767233?s=20&t=XbidzCD5y6vvVQGjKHRCTQ\nWhile Street Fighter fans were hit with an abundance of info (both officially and very unofficially) last month, Capcom has since gone quiet on the new fighter, with nary a new character announcement, trailer, or update to be seen. We are almost guaranteed to hear some new info at EVO, (perhaps even SDCC), hopefully in the form of a character trailer or two. In the meantime, be sure to check out our previous reports on the leaked character roster, the breakdown of Family Man Guile, and a look at the sequel's intriguing new mechanics.\nEVO 2022 will take place at Las Vegas' Mandalay Bay resort on the weekend of August 5-7.

Alongside confirming it's simply called Skate, the team confirms Skate will be a free-to-play live-service game.\nThe new episode of \"The Board Room\" goes into detail about the upcoming model for the new Skate. (Not Skate 4, by the way. Skate, period.) It's targeting PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, and will be both cross-play and cross-progression.\nSkate will also be free to play. The team outlines four rules they have for their monetization: no pay-to-win, no map areas behind a paywall, no paid loot boxes, and no paid gameplay advantages.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAMgtFyrQLk\nIn an interview with The Verge, Skate head of product management Isabelle Mocquard says microtransactions in the game are \"primarily\" going to be for cosmetics and convenience.\n\"I want it to be very clear that it’s not a pay-to-win game,\" Mocquard tells The Verge. \"There won’t be any gameplay areas hidden exclusively behind a paywall. Players won’t be able to buy any gameplay altering advantages.\"\nThe Skate team is planning on things like seasonal drops and live events, though it is still exploring options. Mobile is also an option the team is currently investigating.\nSkate collaboration\nAnother feature the team talks about in this new update is CollaboZones. These let players collaboratively build areas that appear in other players' worlds. It's got a lot of potential for chaos, that's for sure. Giant ramps, slides, and sheer chaos seems like it fits the Skate bill.\nNo release date has been set yet. The team is extending out invites for the Skate playtest though, to get more players into the early look at this new skateboarding game.

          "description": "\"Naive Angel Mode\"\nFollowing Nintendo's release date announcement, Platinum had a tweet of their own to showcase a Bayonetta 3 optional mode: a toggle, actually.\nIt's called \"Naïve Angel mode, and here's what the developer had to say about it:\n\"Relax, the witch is back and sexier than ever. We've added the revolutionary 'Naive Angel Mode' to Bayonetta 3 so more people can fully enjoy it. By turning it on, you can play right in the living room without having to worry about what's on screen... we think.\"\n\nThe tweet goes a step further and actually shows the mode in action with a 40-second video. It slides back and forth and shows what a scene might look like with the toggle on or off. For the most part, as is customary, this seems like it'll be heavily used during \"finishers,\" when Bayonetta utilizes various transformation forms to cut down bosses — but it can also apply costume changes. If you're curious, you can watch it below!\nThis is such a loaded issue, but having it as an optional toggle should (ha!) satisfy as many people as possible. People who don't like the Bayonetta 3 optional mode can completely ignore it, and relish the fact that Nintendo is still releasing M-rated games (as has been the case for a while) on the system. The phrase \"relax, the witch is back and sexier than ever\" implies that Bayonetta 3 will not be a compromise per se.\nWhile talks with platform holders as to what remains \"acceptable\" rage on (mainly with Sony), these sorts of clever solutions could allow studios to have it both ways.\nhttps://twitter.com/platinumgames/status/1547216944470069248\nThe post Platinum is adding an optional mode for Bayonetta 3 that hides fanservice appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Sega shares what Demon Slayer DLC is on the horizon\nAs the Demon Slayer show gears up for the next arc later this year, we're headed to the Entertainment District this week, as more Demon Slayer DLC is getting released today.\nIt's none other than Tengen Uzui, the sound Hashira (they're kind of like masters/leaders); one of the flashy leads of the aforementioned Entertainment arc. Alongside Tengen, everyone can download a new arena/stage (Entertainment District) for free, which is playable in versus mode. Tengen is also playable in versus, and comes with \"a set of profile photos and quotes.\"\nHere's the Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Hinokami Chronicles DLC schedule (which Sega says is \"five separate releases\"):\nTengen Uzui\nNezuko Kamado (Advanced Demon Form)\nTanjiro Kamado (Entertainment District)\nZenitsu Agatsuma (Entertainment District)\nInosuke Hashibira (Entertainment District)\nDaki\nGyutaro\nIf you're curious, the character [season] pass is $24.99. Sega stresses that all platforms will be able to partake, including PC and Switch. And speaking of Switch-related stuff: the Kimetsu Academy Summer Uniforms, a Switch exclusive, are arriving on every platform today for $4.99. Here's what that entails, outfit-wise:\nKimetsu Academy Tanjiro Kamado,\nKimetsu Academy Nezuko Kamado,\nKimetsu Academy Zenitsu Agatsuma,\nKimetsu Academy Inosuke Hashibira\nKimetsu Academy Giyu Tomioka.\nThis is neither here nor there, but I can't tell you how many times I wrote \"Bandai Namco\" for any story having to do with this game: it's still crazy to me that they aren't publishing their 1000th anime action brawler!\nThe post Tengen is out in the Demon Slayer game, DLC schedule announced appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Wii Make Movies\nNintendo has announced that it is currently in negotiations to acquire Dynamo Pictures, a visual content company located in Tokyo, Japan. Once the deal completes later this year, the CG-heavy studio is expected to be re-monikered Nintendo Pictures, and will produce content for Nintendo going forward.\nNintendo has not specified exactly what role Nintendo Pictures will play in the future. Speaking in its public statement of intent, the legendary publisher succinctly states: \"Nintendo has decided to acquire 100% of the outstanding shares (excluding treasury shares) of Dynamo Pictures and make it a wholly owned subsidiary to strengthen the planning and production structure of visual content in the Nintendo group.\"\nWhile it might be easy to jump to the conclusion that this acquisition will see Nintendo dive into the overcrowded market of TV and movie production, it should also be noted that the new subsidiary could simply be directed to produce trailers, showcases, montages, and CGI sequences for Nintendo's various video game releases and live streaming events. Dynamo has previously worked with Nintendo on a series of cute Pikmin shorts, and has also produced CG content for a variety of video game and anime releases, including Death Stranding, Ghost in the Shell, NieR Replicant, Persona 5, and Monster Hunter World.\nYou can check out Nintendo's public statement of intent right here. Nintendo intends to purchase all remaining shares of Dynamo Pictures by October 3, whereby it will become owned and operated directly by the video game giant.\nThe post Nintendo to acquire CG visual content studio Dynamo Pictures appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Running off like that was reckless AND stupid\nIt was always inevitable that Capcom's Resident Evil 2 remake was going to do gangbusters numbers — after all, the studio was revisiting one of their most closely-held, beloved, and nostalgic releases. But it seems that the pull of the Raccoon City Police Department knows no bounds, with the recent news that the critically acclaimed revisit has surpassed a staggering 10 million total sales.\nReleased in 2019, a little over 20 years on from the groundbreaking PlayStation classic, Resident Evil 2 is a retelling of the worst \"first day on the job\" ever. Heroes Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield roll into Raccoon City to find that the entire town has been besieged by terrifying biokinetic monsters. Holding fort in the most bizarrely designed police station in modern memory, the new friends attempt to survive the night, holding off a menagerie of beasties while uncovering the truth about the living nightmare now engulfing the burned-out 'berg.\nCapcom's revelation of the remake's ongoing success is timely, arriving on the same day that streaming service Netflix premieres its live-action adaptation, Resident Evil. The new show sees lead character Jade Wesker (Ella Balinska) attempting to make sense of the increasingly threatening world around her, whilst also coming to terms with the miserable and destructive legacy her bloodline has left behind. While I am yet to check out the show myself, this morning's round of reviews seem quite divisive, but still err on the side of positivity for the most part.\nResident Evil 2 is available now on PS4, PC, and Xbox One.\nThe post Resident Evil 2 remake has sold a massive 10 million copies appeared first on Destructoid.",

Oh, and free heroes will continue to rotate. That's...pretty much it. No balances, no reworks (which were said to be in the works last time we spoke with the team), and definitely no new heroes this week.\nFor many Heroes of the Storm community members (and former developers!), this past week has been a punch in the gut. Most notably, the Into the Nexus podcast — which has been the marquee Heroes podcast since the game launched seven years ago (and with pre-launch episodes, before that) — is saying goodbye to the game this month, and will shift the podcast to a new focus.\nIt's been a heck of a run. Heroes remained one of my favorite games since it arrived in June of 2015, year after year. I know a handful of people that still play it regularly, and the community is among one of the most passionate pockets of gaming I've witnessed in my entire life. I mean, with the servers still online maybe there's potential down the road for some miracle to happen (especially under the Microsoft banner); but for now, the game is decidedly in a state of cryostasis.\nThe post Heroes of the Storm just got a really sad update that codified maintenance mode appeared first on Destructoid.",

The game’s first open beta kicks off on July 26. Additionally, an early access period begins a week earlier on July 19 for anyone who participated in May’s closed alpha or received Twitch drop codes.\nThe open beta for the free-to-play fighter will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Online play supports cross-play and features rollback netcode. The beta will include eight maps, a variety of gameplay modes, and the same roster of characters playable during the alpha with one big addition: the Iron Giant.\nThe peace-loving robot from the (criminally underrated) titular animated film joins the fray, and a new trailer provides glimpses of him in action. \n\n\nWe still don’t know when MultiVersus will launch in full, but we’ve been mostly impressed with it so far.

The studio describes the untitled project as a single-player “immersive action horror game,” and it’s being made for PC, console, and VR. The game's website states that it's developed using Unreal Engine 5 and has an original story that takes place between Alien and Aliens \"where a battle hardened veteran has a vendetta against the Xenomorphs.\"\nThere’s no trailer or screenshots, but Survios says we’ll learn more about the game on July 21 during San Diego Comic-Con at the “Alien: Expanding a Dark and Frightening Universe” panel.\nThis project is unrelated to Aliens: Dark Descent, the Aliens tactical shooter, announced during Summer Game Fest last month. Survios is hiring for positions on the title, suggesting it’s still very early in development. As such, it has no release window, but hopefully, we’ll get a better idea of what it entails during Comic-Con.",

Users also subscribed to PlayStation Plus gain the added benefit of automatically earning loyalty points for making purchases.\nLoyalty points can also be spent on “digital collectibles.\" Examples described in the post are digital figurines of game characters or old PlayStation devices. These collectibles will evidently come in various rarities, with Chen stating players will always have “ultra rare” collectibles to chase. \nThese collectibles may sound like NFTs, but they’re not. As Chen adamantly explains in a Washington Post interview, these digital items can’t be traded or sold and PlayStation Stars does not utilize blockchain technology in any way.  \n“It’s definitely not NFTs. Definitely not” says Chen.\nPlayStation Stars will gradually roll out across different regions sometime later this year. What do you think of this new loyalty program? Let us know in the comments!",

Movie. Official documentation of the purchase states: \n\"Nintendo has decided to acquire 100% of the outstanding shares (excluding treasury shares) of Dynamo Pictures and make it a wholly owned subsidiary to strengthen the planning and production structure of visual content in the Nintendo group. The Acquisition is expected to close on October 3, 2022…[and] will have only a minor effect on Nintendo's results for this fiscal year.\"\nWhat animated Nintendo projects are you looking forward to?

We knew that the action romp would come exclusively to Switch this year, but today Nintendo announced an October 28 release date with an appropriately over-the-top trailer. \n\n\nPlatinum Games' enemy and hero designs for the franchise remain stunning. Bayonetta sports butterfly wings and tentacled horns in some action sequences, while enemies take the form of armored animals – homunculi, artificial bioweapons. You'll fire canons from a moving train in a ravaged cityscape, ride grotesque crabs up skyscrapers, and even play as the new katana-wielding witch-in-training, Viola. And let's not forget that you can summon an all-powerful kaiju too. It's all wild and nonsensical as you'd expect but in the best possible way. \n\nBayonetta 3 ups the ante on Switch this October 28. A Trinity Masquerade Edition of the game will also be available, boasting a 200-page art book. More details for the special version of the game will be revealed later.",

While that heat cap is pretty impressive, we'd recommend not testing it. \nBy way of Nintendo Life, Eurogamer referenced Nintendo Japan's Customer Service Twitter account, which advised Switch owners to avoid staggeringly high temperatures and keep the intake and exhaust ports unblocked.  The good news is that if the console gets too hot, it’ll automatically sleep. And for those who like to play using the Switch port, keep the setup in a cool spot.

However, while the game features many tenants of the open-world genre, Sonic Team is adamant about calling Frontiers an \"open-zone\" game instead. While on the surface that sounds like little more than a marketing ploy, after chatting with the developers, it makes more sense as you dig deeper into its meaning.\nComing off 2017's Sonic Forces, a game that didn't fare well with critics or fans, the development team wanted to shake things up. Forces received criticism for its generic 3D level design, unfulfilling story, short length, and poor 2D gameplay compared to the then-newly released Sonic Mania. According to Sonic Frontiers director Morio Kishimoto (who a…",

According to information coming from Japan, Takahashi was found floating in shallow waters on the coast of Nago City on the Island of Okinawa by the country’s Coast Guard yesterday, July 6. He was wearing snorkeling gear when found by the Coast Guard. Both the Coast Guard and local police are investigating his death. \nTakahashi’s manga career began in 1982, but it didn’t truly take off until the release of Yu-Gi-Oh! in 1996. In between his start and Yu-Gi-Oh!, though, Takahashi published titles like Fighting Hawk and Tennenshoku Danji Buray, according to Kotaku. After Yu-Gi-Oh! hit shelves in 1996, the series only continued to grow in popularity, spawning a real-life card game in 1999 (that’s still extremely popular today) as well as multiple anime series. Today, the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise spans not just manga, card games, and anime, but video games as well, like this year’s Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel. \n[Source: NHK via IGN]\nThe staff at Game Informer extends their condolences to Takahashi’s family.",

Here’s what the official site has to say on the matter: \nThe Matrix Awakens was first announced and made available on the same night during the 2021 Game Awards. The Unreal Engine 5-powered demonstration from Epic Games stars Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss, who introduces the impressive graphics engine and how close to real-life its visuals can look. Awakens includes an on-rails car shootout throughout a city that often looks like it was ripped from the silver screen despite being rendered on the spot. The demo then lets you roam the massive pre-populated city and change things like time of day or traffic congestion to flex what UE5 is capable of. It’s a terrific showcase for the future of games, so if you haven’t given it a download yet, you’ll want to check it out before the delisting on Saturday.\nYou can watch us tour The Matrix Awakens in this episode of New Gameplay Today.",

That’s because the studio is launching Gwent: Rogue Mage, a new single-player roguelike deckbuilder, tomorrow. \nAnnounced by IGN, Gwent: Rogue Mage launches tomorrow, July 7, on PC, iOS, and Android. IGN reports that this game is what Project Golden Nekker, which the team revealed earlier this year, has turned into, and CD Projekt Red is marketing it as a single-player expansion to Gwent: The Witcher Card Game. However, you won’t need to own that because Rogue Mage is standalone. You can purchase the standalone version for $9.99 or the premium edition, which includes in-game skins and cosmetics, and card packs for the multiplayer portion of Gwent, for $19.99. \n“Rogue Mage came out of us noticing that years after The Witcher 3’s release, there are a significant number of players who want a more PvE experience from Gwent,” game director Vladimir Tortsov told IGN. “While Gwent multiplayer is a fantastic game for those who are looking for a great PvP multiplayer experience, we perfectly understand that many Witcher players loved the original mini-game of Gwent for totally different reasons. With Rogue Mage, we aim to give this audience a reason to play modern-day Gwent in the format they prefer.” \nIGN has an exclusive preview of Gwent: Rogue Mage after going hands-on with it ahead of tomorrow’s release, and if you’re looking for even more details about it, including what this single-player deckbuilder roguelike’s gameplay is like, be sure to check it out. \n[Source: IGN]\nAre you excited to check out Gwent: Rogue Mage?

          "description": "Nearly 30 years after its initial release, Live a Live is finally coming west. This 1994 Super Famicom RPG is from creator Takashi Tokita, one of the key developers behind Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy IV. While it would be fascinating to play through Tokita's original vision of Live a Live, we're getting an enhanced remake using the same HD-2D graphical style from the Octopath Traveler games.\nI recently spent roughly five hours in this ambitiously designed title, and can confidently say I enjoyed almost every second of its unique approach to storytelling and how it's brought to life through beautiful retro visuals. Square Enix is releasing Live a Live on Switch on July 22. Here are a handful reasons why you should put it on your radar:\nSeven Distinct Stories\nA Fun Assortment of Characters\nAdult Language and Humor?\nExcellent Writing\nCombat Has Depth...But Will We See It Enough?\n\n\nIt's Beautiful\nThe 2D-HD look is every bit as stunning as it is in Octopath Traveler. The backdrops in each story are a feast for the eyes. The sprite characters don't offer much animation but do move appropriately to convey an emotion or to highlight a dramatic sequence. The visuals scream of the 16-bit age, but also have modern touches everywhere, like realistic lighting of saloon doors swinging when the stranger strolls in to grab a drink.",

I’m excited by the news because I was worried these excellent spin-offs would never receive a revival like the platforming Mega Man series did a few years back. Many Battle Network games are currently only available on the Game Boy Advance or the now-dying Wii U virtual console, while others remain locked away on the Nintendo DS. However, a large chunk of the series will now be available to anyone who owns a PlayStation 4, Switch, or a PC running Steam. It’s great to see these classic games on modern platforms, and I hope other companies take note of the preservation strategy Capcom has taken …",

Announced by Ubisoft today, this show kicks off at 11 a.m. PT and will hopefully provide a substantial look at the open-world multiplayer ship battles and progress made since the delay. Skull and Bones showed promise when it was first announced during an E3 press conference in 2017. Slated to release in the following year, it was indefinitely delayed, even thought to be canceled given the lack of updates from Ubisoft. With fresh wind behind its sails, we will now see what it looks like on current-gen platforms. Come Thursday, you can view the Ubisoft Forward livestream right here.\nUbisoft also revealed a second livestream slated to air on September 10. We don't know what games are in this presentation, but Ubisoft's blog says it will be for multiple projects. Here's hoping Star Wars, Avatar, Assassin's Creed, and Splinter Cell are mentioned in some capacity, if not outright shown.\nUntil then, are you excited for Skull & Bones? Were you a fan of Ubisoft's pirate-focused Assassins' Creed: Black Flag? Let us know in the comments below!",

Despite the lack of specifics, I was thrilled to hear the indie creator’s next project was in the works.\nThen he surprised everyone. Barone publicly shared early Haunted Chocolatier gameplay footage, and it looked incredible. The art style immediately evoked Barone’s first title, though the developer made it clear fans shouldn’t expect the same experience.\n“In Stardew Valley,” Barone writes in his news blog, “the focus was mor…",

That's right, the world will now suffer from the might and insensitive jokes of two Cryptos invading at once. The latest trailer for Reprobed shows off the co-op carnage, and also provides a great look at the rearranged maps, which feature more buildings, plant life, and things to blow to kingdom come.\nReprobed is slated to release on PC and PlayStation and Xbox consoles on August 30. A $399 collector's edition is on the way and comes with a 27.6-inch Crypto figurine, an Arkvoodle statue, a CD of the orchestral score, and an artbook.\nThe remake of the original Destroy All Humans felt a bit dated. In our review, Joe Juba said \"The brightest moments are when the action gives way to pure chaos. I watched electricity arc between humans, made brains pop out of heads, and turned a secret base into smoldering ruins with my spaceship’s death ray. But like a person floating above the ground in the glow of an abducto beam, those moments aren’t connected to anything substantial; they just make some noise and get flung aside.\" The remake of the sequel modernizes more of the content. Let's hope that helps Crypto find new life again. I'd love to see an entirely new adventure with this foul-mouthed alien leading the charge.\nPurchase",
