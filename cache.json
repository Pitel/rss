A few members of the Nintendo Life team have done just that below, so feel free to give our entries a read and then join in with your own via our comment section.

But far from being a step down from World, Monster Hunter Rise is every bit its equal - and Capcom's stellar work with this PC port has given it a much-needed buff and polish to really make it shine. Not only does Rise offer the same seamless and expansive environments as World, but it also adds a few new twists to make tracking down its titular titans even more enjoyable. \nRead more",

It is a world simulation game that has no resource costs or goals, just simulated events. You make a world, plop some animals and fantasy races into it (and if you want, a bunch of dragons and wizards) and see what happens. I cannot stop playing it. And I wanted to give some more detailed examples of how the simulation works, especially if you just leave it running with little intervention.\nI am a WorldBox scientist, you see (though merely a BSc at the moment), and my first experiments suggest that every civilisation, along a long enough time scale, is basically doomed. Big 2022 energy. In the case of WorldBox, this may be because at some stage the scientist running the experiment will get bored and drop in e.g. a tornado. That's okay, because there are almost infinite experiments to run. I hope that isn't how the simulation I am living in is being run. Oh no. Don't think about it.\nRead more",

This makes for a tactical spin on zombie-slaying that truly rewards teamwork, and it’s wonderful as a result.\nRead more",

We've got another year of hip new video games to look forward to, and we've been busy rustling up the ones we're most excited about. In truth, there are tons of games on the horizon that could easily sit on this list, and some of them are so close to release we can practically already see the pixels on our screens morphing into their lush, polygonal landscapes. Games like Monster Hunter Rise, God Of War and Rainbow Six Extraction. You won't find them here, but trust us, you'll be seeing a lot of them over the coming weeks. \nThere are always more games coming out than we have fingers to write about them, but the 2022 games we've listed below are the ones the RPS team are personally most looking forward to playing. We've got games big and small here, and they're all listed in alphabetical order. After all, release dates are increasingly slippery beasts these days. Think we've missed something? Why not take to the comments below and tell us all about it. You might just convince us to put it on our radars. But enough from me. Here are our 43 most anticipated games of 2022.\nRead more",

Within a couple of hours of each other. But my stress is your gain, as there are and will be some major announcements on new kit, starting with AMD. Their freshly-announced hardware includes an assortment of new CPUs, desktop and mobile graphics cards and even some laptop APUs – APUs that sound a lot more useful for gaming that what current integrated graphics can offer. There’s even an Nvidia Image Scaling rival in the upcoming, driver-level Radeon Super Resolution feature. \r\n\n \nRead more",

It's being made by Inflexion Games, a studio lead by Aaryn Flynn, former programmer and general manager at the Dragon Age and Mass Effect developers. \nBut don't go in expecting the sort of huge, arcing plotlines of BioWare's recent games. While Nightingale will have an over-arching narrative, it's being designed to offer up adventures that let you make your own stories. I spoke to Flynn at the end of last year to find out a little bit more about what that entails.\nRead more",

For all its wretched decay, however, the series still feels like an indulgence to be savoured. Its clickiness and abhorrent sights make the games endlessly gratifying, and masterful butchery of fiends eases most players into a comfortable rhythm. And part of that appeal lies in the macabre yet captivating fantasy it so deftly peddles — all that blood, gore and guts really make for a grisly setting that’s nearly impossible to look away from.\r\n\n\nTainted Grail: Conquest conveys the same sense of blight and doom in its dark fantasy universe — one that’s a reimagining of Arthurian legends — but also ups the ante with a huge wallop of Slay The Spire’s roguelike, deck-building elements.\nRead more",

I loved Animal World. I used to spend hours trying to mind-hack my way into it.

          "description": "It’s hard to imagine a collaboration between Zero Escape and Danganronpa creators Kotaro Uchikoshi and Kazutaka Kodaka going under the radar, but an odd release schedule (involving dropping a half-finished experience on Apple Arcade) saw interest in the collaboration buried by the time the game hit PC last month. Which is a shame, since it’s a rather unique title in their respective careers, and it charts new waters for these cult directors.\r\n\n\nWorld’s End Club was the first game the pair released since forming their own studio, Too Kyo Games, and can best be described as a bizarre but intriguing blend of platforming and death games, starring a cast of prepubescent children way too young to be fixing the world or dealing with cults. Think Danganronpa, if Danganronpa was a Saturday morning cartoon rather than a murder game filled with psychopaths.\r\n\n \nRead more",

They spend the day clinging to the ceiling of this big cave, and all their bat poo falls down and has become a towering heap carpeting the floor.\nBut then David said look, the carpet is moving. And it turns out that the whole bottom of the cave is covered in cockroaches and giant centipedes. And if ever a small baby bat or an old injured bat falls, it is eaten alive by this hoard of chittering insects. This nature documentary haunted me, for it was the worst thing I could imagine happening.\nAnyway, Nate has been to that cave and he's going to tell us all about it for this episode of our supporters only podcast, The Nate Files.

I'm not one for looking forward. If a game's not out yet it tends to disappear from my mind, making room for a hundred other recent releases in this age of plenty. That I've less interest in looking back over this year than I do pondering the next suggests that maybe we're in for something special in the coming twelve months.

Between now and January 5th, thousands of games will be discounted across Steam, and you'll also be able to claim a free sticker every day as well, for those of you who enjoy that sort of thing.  \nRead more",

I envisaged myself wiling away most evenings with my mates, playing Oddball and Slayer and laughing like someone from those video game adverts, swaying violently with a controller in hand.\nI now know the reason why and I hate to admit it. Infinite doesn’t have a battle royale mode, which I've come to realise is the perfect FPS template for gaming with my mates. Something about it just works, you know?

          "description": "I know almost nothing about Alfred Hitchcock. He’s the kind of archetypal director whose work I’ve been exposed to in bits and pieces without ever actually sitting down to watch one of his films in full. All of that is to say that, upon starting Alfred Hitchcock - Vertigo the game, I was in no position to judge whether it was a faithful adaptation of the film or to recognize all but the most obvious illusions to Hitchcock’s body of work (look, birds!). That’s okay, though, because as it turns out, Vertigo is an original story based on a collage of Hitchcockian concepts, not a direct adaption of the 1958 film by the same name.\nVertigo the game follows author Ed Miller as he grapples with a debilitating case of vertigo–a condition that leaves him unable to stand as the world appears to spin around him–and paralyzing guilt over the death of his daughter and her mother, Faye, after their car falls off a bridge into a ravine below. With Ed bed ridden, it’s up to Dr. Julia Lomas, psychologist and psychiatrist, and Sheriff Nick Reyes to unravel the mystery of what really happened, and whether Faye and his daughter even exist. My thoughts on how Vertigo goes about telling this story are... complicated. \nRead more",

Games that were delayed by the pandemic last year finally got their due in 2021, but in turn many of the releases we were expecting this year have inevitably slipped into 2022. The pandemic has affected games of all sizes this year, and I don't think it will go down in the history books as one of our all-time greats. There were still plenty of fantastic games that came out this year, mind, and we're still counting down our absolute favourites over in our Advent Calendar. \nThat said, I do think 2021 will prove to be a pivotal year for RPS - and not just because I stole Graham's key card and changed the locks on the front door of the Treehouse. It's been a year of immense change here at the site, so I wanted to take some time to reflect on everything that's happened this year, and look forward to what we've got in store for 2022.\nRead more",

Will the formula shake-up from the standard treatment prove to be a success? While that remains to be seen, a trailer unveiled today gives prospective players a taste of some of the experiences they can expect to see in the latest Pokémon entry. While it’s been already relayed that the game won’t be a “true” open world, it looks like the colorful little critters do roam free in various areas. Check out the full trailer below.\nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nAn action slant and style for the game seems to add quite a few new elements for players to engage with, while still maintaining the classic core of Pokémon. Based on the new trailer, it looks like crafting will be quite important as a mechanic, so that particular aspect is intriguing to me. Also, you can fly on a bird, which makes me wonder if the rest of the traditional HM abilities will be represented with heavy action and mobility. I’d say there’s a pretty good chance, especially since it looks like you can also surf around in the water on your favorite Gyrados.\nAre you looking forward to a different direction in Pokémon for this title? Will it be a Switch smash hit to start the year? Let us know in the comments!",

Netflix is developing the adaptation with UPC, the group behind Netflix’s The Umbrella Academy and SyFy’s Chucky TV series. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nO’Malley is writing and and executive producing this Scott Pilgrim anime alongside the showrunner for Nickelodeon’s Are You Afraid of the Dark? series, Ben David Grabinski. However, it’s important to note that a series order has not been made, so the anime isn’t entirely off the ground just yet – it’s simply in the works for now. If it’s picked up for a full series order, O’Malley and Grabinski will serve as the showrunners. \nAs far as animation goes, it’s being handled by anime studio Science Saru (Devilman Crybaby, Star Wars Visions). Saru’s Eunyoung Choi will be a producer for Scott Pilgrim and the company’s Abel Gongora will direct the series. The Hollywood Reporter writes that the members of the Sex Bob-omb are set to be featured in the anime, with Scott Pilgrim movie director Edgar Wright and producing partner Nira Park also working as executive producers on the series alongside and Adam Seigel, Jared LeBoff, Marc Platt, and Michael Bacall.  \n\"Scott Pilgrim\" was published as six volumes between 2004 and 2010 and Wright’s movie based on those volumes, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, was released in 2010 with Michael Cera playing the titular character. There’s no word if any of the cast members from that film are returning for the anime. \nWhile waiting for the anime, read about why Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game is still one of the best 2D brawlers out there. \n[Source: The Hollywood Reporter]\nAre you excited for this anime?

          "description": "Elden Ring is seemingly the hype train that just won’t stop and with less than two months to go until release, it is now officially Steam’s most anticipated title. \nThat’s because From Software’s upcoming action RPG is now the most wishlisted game on Steam. It’s an impressive feat for Elden Ring as Techland’s highly-anticipated sequel to 2015’s Dying Light held that spot for 12 months, as reported by Eurogamer. Steam’s “Top Wishlists” page is a great indicator for Steam player hype, but unfortunately, it does not reveal any specific numbers.\nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nHowever, someone wishlisting a game does not automatically translate to a purchase so if there were numbers, it wouldn’t necessarily be indicative of how much Elden Ring is going to sell on Steam. It’s a great indicator for general excitement around the title, though, and considering Dying Light 2 held the top spot for a year (after taking it from Cyberpunk 2077), Elden Ring is sitting pretty. \nFor context, here’s what the top 10 on Steam’s “Top Wishlists” page looks like right now: \nElden Ring\nDying Light 2 Stay Human\nParty Animals\nGod of War (2018)\nHollow Knight: Silksong\nThe Day Before\nVampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2\nS.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chernobyl\nStarfield\nFrostpunk 2\nAs you can see, Elden Ring is sitting above some very exciting releases such as Starfield, the PC version of God of War, and the sequel to indie darling Hollow Knight, Hollow Knight: Silksong. Hopefully, Elden Ring delivers on all the hype it’s garnered so far. One Game Informer editor who previewed the game seems to think so. \nFor more about Elden Ring, check out some gameplay from this New Gameplay Today segment and then watch the latest trailer released for Elden Ring.

This week, we examine Bungie's smaller experimental entry in the series, Halo 3: ODST.\nHalo 3: ODST was released on the Xbox 360 on September 22, 2009, and was intended to be a smaller project designed by a skunkworks team. However, the development of ODST has roots in Peter Jackson's aborted attempt to make a Halo film/game. For the next hour, we talk about ODST's relatively short development time, why the title changed from Halo 3: Recon, the innovative Firefight multiplayer mode, and Bungie's push to spin out from under Microsoft and become its own company again.\nJoin hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves) and Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and former Game Informer editor Bryan Vore (@Bryan_Vore) as we unpack the history and impact of the first Halo game to not feature Master Chief.  And for more Halo, be sure to check out our definitive ranking of every Halo game.\nCheck out the rest of our podcast on the Video Gameography hub.

There are rumors as to who the final character will end up being, but what we do know is there's only one spot on a team open, and it's alongside Ash Crimson and Kukri. \nThe King of Fighters XV is scheduled for release on February 17 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Those who preorder it digitally can start fighting a few days sooner with an early access period that begins on February 14.",

          "description": "A not-so-long time ago in the same galaxy we all reside in, Respawn Entertainment deviated from its first-person shooter roots to create Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66. After he’s outed by the Sith, he embarks on a quest to recover an artifact capable of locating force-sensitive children while also avoiding capture by the Inquisitors, who are elite Jedi hunters. \nThe game features a blend of lightsaber combat and a suite of Force abilities. Borrowing inspiration from FromSoftware’s Soul series, encounters are challenging, requiring a strategic blend of blocks and parries to outduel opponents. Meanwhile, the various planets take on a Metroid-inspired progression with players unlocking abilities to backtrack to previously inaccessible areas. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nFallen Order was released November 15, 2019, and was a critical and financial success. It also served as a saving grace for single-player fans, providing proof to an increasingly multiplayer-focused EA that linear story-driven experiences can still make the big bucks. With a sequel reportedly in the works, we’re revisiting this gem of the Star Wars video game pantheon. \nJoin Marcus Stewart, Daniel Tack, and Andrew Reiner on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central as we journey through the entirety of Cal Kestis’ adventure. Expect plenty of laughs, deaths, and general nerding out over all things Star Wars. We encourage you to hang out with us in chat.

Vaas’ Insanity was the first part of a villain-focused trilogy included in the Far Cry 6 season pass that costs $40. The second villainous DLC will star Far Cry 4’s Pagan Min, and now, Ubisoft announced that it’s coming next week. \nDive into the twisted mind of Pagan Min. The new Pagan: Control DLC is coming January 11. pic.twitter.com/2hIr1xoPkc\nJanuary 5, 2022\nMore specifically, it will go live on January 11. Like the Vaas experience before it and the forthcoming Joseph Seed DLC coming after it, this Pagan Min-focused episode called Pagan: Control is a rogue-like experience that sees the Troy Baker-voiced villain “struggling to escape the horrors of their own minds.” You will die a lot and retry a lot, Ubisoft promises. \nYou begin with a pistol and must find new weapons and powers to progress through Pagan Min’s mind. You’ll be able to give this experience a go in five days on January 11. \nFor more, read about the other DLC offerings you can expect in Far Cry 6, and then check out our thoughts on the game in Game Informer’s Far Cry 6 review.

On the flip side, the battle-hardened Tenakth, which is divided into three clans, serves as the dominant tribe in the Forbidden West. One of those clans is the Regalla, the rebel faction shown in previous trailers that are at war with their fellow clansfolk. As powerful as the Tenakth is, the trailer hints at rumors of an even stronger group residing on the outer reaches of the Forbidden West.\nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nHorizon Forbidden West launches on February 18 for PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4.

The short story trailer, which runs less than three minutes, reveals that Neon is a Manila, Philippines-based agent with an excellent taste in music. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nAs you can see in the trailer, Neon is a fan of Entertain Me by Ylona Garcia and 88rising. She’s also seemingly a fan of dreaming about what players are going to accomplish on the battlefield using her powers. We see her sprinting and sliding all over the maps shown in the trailer, using her electricity to make it easier. However, it doesn’t seem like she’ll be able to shoot while sprinting so don’t expect to be the run-n-gunner Neon might appear to be. \nWe also get a quick look at one of her abilities where Neon lifts two large and long walls of electricity in a straight line, walls that she’s free to run in and out of. \nThe trailer also reveals that Neon will arrive in Valorant with Episode 4: Disruption, although a release date for this new episode (which is what Valorant calls its big updates) has not yet been revealed. However, the current battle pass ends on January 11 so some fans have speculated that Episode 4 will begin the following day on January 12. \nWhile waiting to learn more, check out our thoughts on the shooter in Game Informer’s Valorant review and then read about how Valorant’s director is no longer working on the game and instead working on a new secret project at Riot.

Of course, “shipped” is very different than “sold,” as this new statistic doesn’t necessarily indicate 4 million people have purchased the game, but manufacturers aren’t going to ship a game to storefronts when said storefronts have plenty in stock. \n『#ゼルダ無双 厄災の黙示録』の全世界累計出荷本数が400万本を突破しました。プレイしていただいた皆さま、誠にありがとうございます。\nhttps://t.co/VV14JMDMeV#ゼルダの伝説 #Zelda\nJanuary 5, 2022\nSo while Age of Calamity hasn’t sold 4 million units, it has likely sold millions, which must be exciting for Omega Force. The team had to pull off quite the feat to make it a success, as creating a prequel to Breath of the Wild, one of the most celebrated games of all time, is no easy task. Omega Force even went a step further and created an expansion pass for Age of Calamity that furthered the prequel story by adding in controllable guardians, new weapons, and a rideable motorcycle to use in-game. These expansions also brought a new “Apocalyptic” difficulty to the musou as well as new challenges in the Royal Ancient Lab, new enemies, and more. \nFor more about Age of Calamity, read this feature on why Omega Force made this musou a prequel in the first place, and then check out our thoughts on the game in Game Informer’s Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity review. \nHave you played Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity?

          "description": "Update 2, 1/05/2021: Epic Games has revealed the rewards players will be getting after Fortnite went down for several hours back in December. \nGame Informer first reported on December 29 that Fortnite was down due to server issues and after several hours of the battle royale being offline, Epic Games pushed it back online. They promised rewards to compensate for the downtime, too. The company didn't announce at the time what those rewards would be, but the official Fortnite Twitter account revealed what we can expect today. \nAs thanks for everyone’s patience during the December login issues, we’ll be kicking off a Power Leveling Weekend from 1/7 @ 7 PM to 1/10 @ 7 AM ET and granting everyone who logged in during Winterfest the new Crescent Shroom Pickaxe before it arrives in the Shop later…",

          "description": "It is important to keep in mind what is going on within Activision Blizzard at this time regarding ongoing allegations about the work culture. The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over reported toxic workplace culture. The bulk of the suit focuses on \"violations of the state's civil rights and equal pay laws,\" specifically regarding the treatment of women and other marginalized groups.

          "description": "Skull & Bones has lost a co-director. \nFirst reported by Video Games Chronicle, Antoine Henry recently revealed on LinkedIn that he's departing from Ubisoft after working for nearly 15 years at the company. Henry says he's onto \"new exciting adventures\" very soon, which is great. Still, his departure from the company's Singapore studio serves as yet another loss for the Skull & Bones team, which has seemingly struggled to make any headway since its 2017 reveal. \nGame Informer chronicled Skull & Bones' journey through development hell recently in Part 1 of our Video Games Stuck In Development Hell series (here's Part 2 and Part 3 if you're curious for more). In short, this nautical game was last seen by the public in 2018 – we went hands-on with it that year. There was even a beta players w…",

          "description": "Ghost of Tsushima is an ode to the filmography of acclaimed Japanese director Akira Kurosawa. So, it's only natural that Sucker Punch's visually stunning action/adventure game would find the same success as the samurai flicks that inspired it. Ghost of Tsushima is as popular as ever, with 8 million copies sold. \nWe're thrilled and amazed that #GhostOfTsushima has officially sold more than 8 million copies!\npic.twitter.com/AQfyqviBlK\nJanuary 5, 2022\nA recent tweet (seen above) revealed the game's newest milestone: \"We're thrilled and amazed that Ghost of Tsushima has officially sold more than 8 million copies! Thank you so much to everyone who has played since launch! We are so incredibly appreciative and grateful for the support!\" \nIt's no surprise that Ghost of Tsushima had such a sizable player base. Cutting-edge graphics (somehow made more impressive with the PlayStation 5's Director's Cut), fluid combat mechanics with flashy animations, and a story/game world inundated in Japanese culture and samurai lore help set Ghost of Tsushima apart from its contemporaries. Game Informer's Matt Miller loved the vanilla game, awarding it a 9.5. In his impression piece on the Director's Cut, he echoed the same shining sentiments from his original review while speaking to the added content:\n\"I was happily surprised by the breadth, depth, and challenge of the Iki Island expansion. For new players, it will extend an already lengthy adventure into something more. Meanwhile, returning players should be thrilled at how well this experience dovetails out of an already stellar game. Iki Island is what I want out of single-player game expansions. And it's further proof (as if we needed any more at this point) that Sucker Punch has a standout new property to continue building on.\"\nI've been playing through the Director's Cut myself and am completely enamored with Ghost of Tsushima's art direction and overall vibe. What are your thoughts on Sucker Punch's latest IP? Let us know down below!",
