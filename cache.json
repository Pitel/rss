          "description": "Before the Lobotomy.\nBringing cult classics to a more modern, updated platform can be a risky proposition. What, if anything, do you change, and what do you keep the same? When the game you happen to be porting originated on the DS, a certain degree of change is inevitable given the shift from a two-screen to a single-screen format, so naturally, a careful balance has to be struck in order to rope in new players while keeping original fans happy. With Dementium: The Ward, developer Atooi has opted for the safest route possible, porting its 2015 3DS remaster of the 2007 original over to the Switch with as few unnecessary changes as possible. While this makes for an authentic recreation that helps preserve the game in light of the 3DS eShop closure, it also highlights some of its unfortunate drawbacks.\nTaking place within a creepy medical ward, your protagonist awakens with no memory, and it’s up to you to escape from the complex alive, fighting off gruesome enemies and solving puzzles along the way. It’s your typical survival horror but with first-person mechanics; in a way, it feels like a precursor to what Resident Evil would eventually morph into with its seventh mainline entry.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Now we can add Wild Card Football to the mix, and it's certainly an ambitious release in comparison to its contemporaries on the system. From Saber Interactive, it follows a similar approach to NBA Playgrounds and its 2K-pubished sequel, albeit this time the studio is flying solo and doesn't have the official NFL license.\nWhat it does have is an NFLPA license, the player's association, and that's a big part of the pitch for Wild Card Football. While teams are fictional, the players — current and former — are very much real, and interestingly the equivalents to NFL teams are named after their quarterbacks. The teams have relatively little in common with the real-world versions, albeit this Bears fan (yes, by all means feel pity for your humble scribe) was surprised that the Justin Fields team had pretty good stats. Hey, not all games have to be realistic. The handful of arenas are also neat, including a hefty stadium, urban locations like Chicago and London, a camping haven in an impressive forest, and a few other fun options. Like the studio's previous sporting output, the approach is fantastical and entertaining.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

In this deceptively Civilization-esque 4X strategy game, all player turns unfold simultaneously, once you've decided what to build or research, where to move your units, and so on. As Oxide Games design director Michelle Menard tells me over Zoom, this approach takes inspiration from an ancient military simulator, Kriegsspiel, which was devised by the Prussian army officer George Leopold von Reisswitz, aka the \"father of wargaming\", in the mid-1800s. \r\n\n\r\n\"It was to train their generals, it was a legit apparatus of war, it was not for funsies,\" says Menard. \"And they basically created this massive table that had a modular terrain system. At first they used sand, but that was kind of messy, [and so] they developed a system where they had interchangeable tiles, like hills and valleys and plateaus. \r\n\n\r\n\"They would build out this table, literally drop a sheet down the middle, and it'd be like, OK, you guys on each side, you can't see what the other person's doing. There was an actual game master, who was the referee who you would report your moves to. He would then re-set up the board and basically call people back into the room and be like, tada! It's the next turn - let's see what people did. Was it what you expected?\" \r\n\n \nRead more",

The G413 SE employs the bumpy 'tactile' style of mech switches, so it’s good for accurate typing, and it’s easily fast and agile enough for gaming duty as well. I actually ended up using this as my main keyboard for a while, despite having more expensive linear-switch boards piled up in a nearby cupboard, and I’d extra-extra-recommend it at this price.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Are you a Mac player who's been hungrily looking forward to the eventual Mac port of Counter-Strike 2, released last month, after sinking many hours and much pocket money into the preceding Counter-Strike: Global Offensive? Fantastic news, it's been binned off! In the course of making what they're calling \"the largest technical leap in CS history\", Valve have decided to discontinue support for MacOS. They're also doing away with support for older PCs, including DirectX 9 and 32-bit operating systems - in future, the game will be exclusive to 64-bit Windows and Linux systems. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Sometimes, when I’m winning a Total War battle handily, I like to pick an absolutely haggard group of low-tier hopelesses and spend the rest of the fight zoomed in on them, narrativising their high-stakes struggles in a rich and velvety internal monologue that monopolises my attention so fully that I more or less ignore the rest of the battle. That these are among my absolute favourite Total War moments may say something about the level of satisfaction to be found elsewhere in the series’ strategy sandboxes, at times as robust as ancient oaks, others as stale as ancient wotsits. It may be an admission on both our parts that, for all its simulated complexity, Total War is really for people who’d be just as happy playing with those little elasticated catapults and plastic castles, if we could still sit on the floor without our pelvises crumbling into soup mix.  \r\n\n\nTotal War: Pharaoh, which I will acknowledge once and once only as being officially stylised PHARAOH, is almost certainly the most systemically interesting and quality-of-life-full a Total War game has been at launch for a very long time. Three Kingdoms has better diplomacy, Warhammer has unequivocally better goblins, but none are as refreshingly cavalier and passionately thorough with the blueprint of what Total War has the potential to be. CA Sofia should be immensely proud of what they’ve done here, but the realities of Total War’s ridiculous release schedule now clearly mean that even a studio as willing and able to innovate so much in such a short time frame are effectively prevented from producing a genuinely exciting strategy game. I’d love to tell you these new plastic castles are more fun than your old ones, but there’s not even any catapults.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Meta may have spent the last couple of years tumbling down a metaverse rabbit hole, but the company is still responsible for creating the best VR hardware around. The Meta Quest 2 was the ideal gaming VR package: powerful and accessible enough to provide easy, convincing immersion, while also staying highly affordable. Nonetheless, Meta’s sudden fixation on creating a legless version of Second Life did have me worried about the future trajectory of its VR hardware. What daft gimmickry would their next headset come festooned with, and what would it mean for the future of the Quest as a gaming device?\r\n\n\r\nWith the Meta Quest 3, we have the answer. And the truth is, Meta’s latest headset does have a whiff of Metaverse about it. Dubbed a \"mixed reality\" device, its raison d’être is to break down the barrier between reality and the virtual world. While mixed reality is an angle I’m not wholly sold on from a gaming perspective, crucially, the features that make it a mixed reality device are useful even if you don’t want to hold a meeting in your office with a bunch of bisected Sims. Moreover, they’re built into a headset that is more powerful, more comfortable, and generally better than the Meta Quest 2.\r\n\n \nRead more",

In what has become a time-honoured ceremony for any AAA game developer a month or two before release, he took a moment to observe that focussing on frame-rate vs resolution is missing the wood for the trees.

          "description": "I do love a game that tells you upfront what it's about while making nary a lick of sense, and visual novel Stop Burying Me Alive, Beautiful is certainly that. You are, indeed, being buried alive. The person burying you is your girlfriend, who waves aside your protests that you aren't dead yet, pointing out that this is exactly what a dead person would say if they were trying to avoid being buried. Can't fault the logic.\nClick the downward arrow below the animated image of your girlfriend burying you alive and you'll discover a murky fungal blackscreen where cartoon rats periodically try to eat you, unless you click to get rid of them. Below that, there's a kind of Alice in Wonderland-style alcove in which a tousled lady with a rat on her shoulder reassures you that being buried alive ain't so bad. As she points out, \"underground is like, the only place to escape capitalism, plus it's nice and cool\". Again, I can't fault the logic. Then she offers to play cards with you. The cards in question have rats doodled on them, including a wonderfully festive rodent Joker. There is passing mention of a \"rat god\".\nRead more",

          "description": "“Baldur’s Gate II set the model, and I obviously loved that model,” says James Ohlen. “But there were a ton of people at BioWare who didn’t like it.” During leadership meetings over the course of the Canadian designer’s 22 years at the RPG studio, he’d sometimes feel totally outnumbered when talking about the importance of story. “Game developers don’t get into the industry to create stories, they get into the industry to create games,” he says. “And so there’s this conflict between game developers and story - my entire career it's been a constant fight.”\r\n\n\r\nOhlen picked his side early. He was telling BioWare stories even before he joined the company. The meeting of Minsc and Boo, one of the most enduring partnerships in PC gaming, came about in a tabletop Dungeons & Dragons game he ran as a teenager. Then a comic book store manager, he took advantage of his premises to guide no fewer than three concurrent D&D groups through their campaigns. “I didn’t really have much of a life outside of Dungeons & Dragons,” he says. \r\n\n \nRead more",

One wonders if any of the people who worked on that have joined the union founded by CD Projekt RED employees this month. The union is part of the larger Polish worker's organisation OZZ Inicjatywa Pracownicza, and comes in response to CD Projekt's firing around 100 employees in July due to \"overstaffing\". Its membership is anonymous and open to people in the industry who aren't employed by the Witcher and Cyberpunk studio, but are thinking about forming a union in their own workplace.\r\n\n\r\n\"We started talking about unionizing after the 2023 wave of layoffs when 9% of Reds (that is roughly 100 people) were let go,\" reads an official FAQ from the group. \"This event created a tremendous amount of stress and insecurity, affecting our mental health and leading to the creation of this union in response. Having a union means having more security, transparency, better protection, and a stronger voice in times of crisis.\"\r\n\n \nRead more",

That allows HP to hit a more aggressive price target, making the Cloud Orbit S one of the most affordable ways to try a great planar magnetic gaming headset. \nThe Cloud Orbit S debuted at a mighty £299.99, but today it's available on Amazon for just £209 - a nice £91 savings. \nRead more",

          "description": "Correction: In 2022 the Axis series switched from titling its games for their current year to titling them for next year. Since I skipped last year's installment, and searches for \"Axis Football 2022\" brought up nothing, I got horribly confused and wrongly stated that the series skipped 2022 entirely. I apologise for this embarrassing error, and for not realising it until the exact moment everyone at RPS went home for the weekend. Although that latter part is at least quite funny.\nAxis Football 2024 is part of the little Americaball series that could. Since 2019 I've settled into a habit of skipping every second entry, only to learn that this time, its developers did too.\nThe result is still iterative improvement, but a more noticeable one in lots of small ways. Its animations in particular combine more naturally, with players visibly struggling to tackle, catch, or shake off an opponent. It feels like a punchier sport, making the significance of blocking and positioning clearer, and bringing out the drama that its coaching mode in particular really thrives on.\r\n\n \nRead more",

However, if you want access to Nvidia's DLSS 3 frame generation and 3.5 ray reconstruction features, and one of the most power-efficient cards on the market, then the 4060 Ti is definitely worth a look. \nThe RTX 4060 Ti normally retails for $400 or higher, but today you can pick up the Zotac Twin Edge OC model for just $370, a sweet $60 savings versus MSRP on one of the best-looking and highest-clocked 4060 Ti models.  \nRead more",

It introduces a new season journey and questline, a new season event, and some skulking new enemies of the Nosferatu persuasion.\r\n\n\r\nThe new quest sounds quite fun from the promotional materials. It sees you investigating a mysterious outbreak of punctured necks, recruiting a local Van Helsing named Erys, and tracking down a Dark Master, while harnessing 22 juicy new vampiric powers care of some pact armour.  The latter range from turning into a cloud of bats, through cursing people, to treating yourself to a spontaneous bloodbath so as to enhance your channeled skills, The trade-off is that you'll have to acquire yet another Diablo 4 resource, potent blood, to perform these tricks.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "In The Lamplighters League, three evil factions are gathering the power to seize an apocalyptic tower, and you must stop them by finding and trashing their power bases. They'll grow in power the whole time, but you'll slow them by stealing and sabotaging with your team of colourful secret agents, who'll bash through gauntlets of mooks and monsters with munitions, magic, and mkicks to the stomach, mostly two action points at a time. All that makes for a colourful ride, and its 1930s setting and adventurous tone carried it for a while, but the more I played it, the more my wavering opinion turned into outright resentment. That's a damn shame, because it gets a lot right.\nRead more",

Mirage cares not for being the glossy poster child of ray-traced glamour; it’s just a game that looks pretty nice and runs well on PC, older hardware and Steam Decks included.\nIt also keeps its list of graphics settings relatively brief, though there are a few in there that can dish out some extra frames per second at little cost to the visuals. Here it is, then: your complete guide to Assassin’s Creed Mirage’s PC performance, from its refreshingly reasonable system requirements to its best settings combinations.\nRead more",

          "description": "What exactly is The Alters? It's a question I've been itching to get answers to ever since Frostpunk and This War Of Mine developers 11 bit Studios first announced their strange new game at notE3 last year. Until now, all we've had to go on is a cryptic CG announcement trailer that showed a gaggle of identical clone-looking men in bright pink medical gowns, all of whom seemingly live inside a giant wheel full of shipping containers. It didn't really tell us anything about what the game actually is, or how it plays, and we've heard precious little about it since. \nHappily, I've now seen about an hour of The Alters in action at this year's Gamescom, and first impressions are very promising. This is indeed a game about sort-of clones living in a big wheely shipping container, but these containers are actually modules you'll be building in XCOM/Fallout Shelter-style chunks to advance the capabilities of your big wheel base as you work to escape the broiling heatdeath that's slowly enveloping the planet. You'll also be venturing out onto the planet's surface to gather resources, all while managing your crew of clo- sorry, alternate selves - as you assign their daily work tasks, and then there's the fact that, well, you're all chuffing different versions of the same person and the literal embodiment of what your life might have been like if you'd done X instead of Y, or Y instead of Z. It's a fascinating blend of ideas, and if 11 bit can stick the landing, I reckon it could end up being something really quite special. Here's everything I learned.\nRead more",

          "description": "After 11 years, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has been, somewhat unceremoniously, shut down in favour of the newer, shinier Counter-Strike: 2. Whether you like it or not, Valve wants you playing CS2. For those who don't take their CS all too seriously, CS2 won't seem like much of a change from CS:GO, besides some grenade changes, more detailed maps, and a disappointing lack of fan favourite game modes. And for those who train their aim on the reg and line up their smoke grenades, CS2 might look the part but lacks the precision of CS:GO's movement and gunplay.\nStill, CS2 captures what makes Counter-Strike tick and even if the foundation seems a little sparse and a touch shaky right now, I'm confident Valve have an FPS that'll supersede CS:GO in time.\nRead more",

Shortly after announcing plans to make the four-player PvE shooter less online-dependent, the developers have revealed that they're also reworking Payday 3's much-reviled progression system.\nRead more",

          "description": "I'm close to being whatever the Assassin's Creed equivalent of a Pokémon genwunner is. It's not like I'm snobby about the newer, more action-oriented Creeds; I welcomed the shift brought in by Assassin's Creed Origins, which shook the series up a bit, and I loved Cassandra kicking her way around Ancient Greece. Valhalla, although it had a relative dearth of things to parkour around, was a fun open-world RPG. Which I suppose is the point.\nAssassin's Creed hasn't been a game about a group of assassins following a creed and striking from the shadows for a long time. Here I would say that Basim, protagonist of Assassin's Creed Mirage kicks down the door and kills everyone in the room, except this new entry in the series is smaller, more focused, and once again concerned largely with stealth, and is all the better for it. So it's more appropriate to say Basim snuck in through an open window and is choking everyone out one by one.\nRead more",

What would the Oxide team make, if they didn't have to worry about budget, audience expectations or any of the other commercial factors that guide the creation of videogames?

It worked really well, and we even used it to talk during lectures, but of course we never released it out into the world and after leaving uni it was abandoned. Years later, I saw the brand called HYTE and my immediate reaction was \"They stole our idea!\"\nOf course, my reading comprehension is poor, and HYTE - the iBuyPower PC case company - is unrelated to my unreleased, unannounced Linux-based chat app. \nAnd so it falls to me to tell you that if you don't have a knee-jerk reaction to four-letter words that look like acronyms but aren't, and you like small PC cases, you might be interested in this US deal for the HYTE Revolt 3. \nThis critically-acclaimed Mini ITX PC case is down to $112 at Newegg or Ebay, a cut below its regular price of $200 and MSRP of $250. $112 is a bloody brilliant price for this case, especially as it comes with a pre-fitted 700W 80+ Gold SFX power supply. \nRead more",

          "description": "As Hollywood still grapples with strikes and other issues, Disney CEO Bob Iger is pressed on a different matter: gaming. According to Bloomberg, advisers at the company want to expand its video game outreach by transforming Disney from distributing game license to a gaming giant. However, Iger is reportedly not too keen on the idea.\n\n\nBloomberg's report outlines the struggles facing Disney and its CEO in detail. Options like gambling, through ESPN and sports betting, have been something that Iger reportedly pushed back on but has now relented on. For gaming, while Disney has licensed their properties to studios, it sounds like Iger's deputies want Disney more involved in the process. One potential option raised by the report is an acquisition, suggesting Electronic Arts as a suitable pick-up.\n\n\nEA, one of gaming's biggest publishers, seems like an ideal candidate to buy. Over the years, the company has created hugely successful franchises like Titanfall, Mass Effect, and Battlefield. Money-wise, the gaming giant is responsible for the EA Sports catalog of games, which rake in millions a year and lines up with its ESPN interests. EA also has a history with Disney, as they licensed Star Wars for their Battlefront and Jedi series of games. \n\n\nCuriously, it sounds like Bob Iger isn't interested in the idea right now. While no reason is given, it's likely that it's not a direction he wants to take Disney. These all are rumors, so, much like the story of Disney's Kingdom Hearts, don't take it too seriously.\n\nThe post Disney CEO reportedly urged to consider making company a gaming giant appeared first on Destructoid.",

Kotick, who has been CEO of Activision since 1991, responded to a bevy of questions.\n\n\n\n\nHe talks about the potential for AI and VR, as well as Elon Musk's Neuralink. Weirdly, he also mentions that, with Microsoft's advanced technology, a potential Guitar Hero revival was teased. A repeated phrase that popped up a lot during the meeting was \"magic\", as Kotick believes Microsoft will keep it alive, just as Activision has for more than 40 years.\n\n\nIt seems like the company, likely to soon become part of Microsoft, wants to deliver fresh content to consumers. Having already absorbed studios Blizzard and King, Activision can finally work on creating a bigger legacy. However, it seems they want to experiment with new technologies more than to build upon what they have. Microsoft had said they wanted to compete with Apple and Google in mobile gaming, which led to them purchasing Activision. While some may dislike the company, Call of Duty, Candy Crush Saga, and World of Warcraft continue to make millions of dollars every year. Where the future might go is unclear. But please don't let James Corden be in Call of Duty.\n\nThe post James Corden hosts weird Activision town hall meeting with Bobby Kotick appeared first on Destructoid.",

As revealed in today's trailer, Byking and Bandai Namco's Jujutsu Kaisen Cursed Clash launches on February 2, 2024.\n\n\n\n\nWhat does the Jujutsu Kaisen game cover?\n\n\nIn the game, players make their own 2v2 teams with more than 15 characters from the manga/show to choose from. As each character has their own set of abilities and attacks, combining them with others can lead to unique power dynamics\n\n\nNarrative-wise, Jujutsu Kaisen Cursed Clash adapts the events of season one of the anime, as well as Jujutsu Kaisen 0. In the story mode, you'll face familiar villains like Sukuna and Jogo and learn about the hidden world of sorcerers. With co-op and competition modes, you'll be able to team up with fellow sorcerers online and face others worldwide in casual or ranked battles. Players will also get to customize their face cards and fighters via costumes. New outfits and cards can be unlocked through gameplay and future DLC.\n\n\nScreenshot via PlayStation YouTube\n\n\nJujutsu Kaisen Cursed Clash will be available in three editions: standard, digital deluxe, and digital ultimate. While the standard only includes the base game, the digital deluxe has the Hidden Inventory/Premature Death DLC and a minigame based on Jujusta 2024 Baseball. Furthermore, the digital ultimate edition comes with all that plus a digital artbook and soundtrack. Additionally, it comes with a costume pack adapting outfits from the \"Lost in Paradise\" end theme from season one. If you preorder the game, you'll receive the First-Year Jujutsu High DLC costume pack.\n\n\nJujutsu Kaisen Cursed Clash expands onto current-gen consoles on February 2, 2024. Pre-orders for Xbox, PC, and PlayStation consoles are available now, with Nintendo Switch's to be available at a later date. \n\nThe post Jujutsu Kaisen Cursed Clash arrives in February 2024 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "I'm into how weird Super Mario Wonder is. Look, all the obvious jokes about shrooms have already been made, but this game looks strange on the whole. That's a great thing, as 2D Mario has been formulaic throughout its history, so we could use a change-up. I'm just glad we're presumably done with the \"New\" series: I mean, it's not new anymore! \n\n\nAll that to say, I just really wanted to share this strange promotional tweet of Bowser being really into an elephant Peach (which is also on YouTube as a short).\n\n\n\n\nPeach speaks (kinda)\n\n\nIn the short 30-second promotional video, Bowser tries to impress Princess Peach with a bouquette of flowers (as he does), and an Elephant Fruit sidles up to the duo and turns Peach into an elephant. After his initial shock, Bowser immediately proposes (we assume) to Peach again. Classic Bowser, completely undeterred by pretty much anything in his life. I can't wait to see him again in Super Mario RPG: he's been missed.\n\n\nInterestingly enough, this is also a brief look at the voice of Peach, amid a major casting change for Mario. Just give us the full voice credits already, Nintendo! I want to see who has been replaced.\n\n\nSuper Mario Bros. Wonder is out on Switch on October 20, and I can't wait to see what it can do. I have a feeling that what Nintendo has shown off so far is just scratching the surface, which would be the shot in the arm the 2D series needs right now.\n\nThe post Bowser trying to impress elephant Peach is what I needed to get me through a Wednesday appeared first on Destructoid.",

This round comes in the form of photos from the publisher's official Nintendo Tokyo Twitter account, and the store really sells itself at this point.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to Mario-laden structures like a giant pipe (complete with Mario's head coming out of it) and a classic \"Mario stage\" motif, there are decals for Zelda, Animal Crossing, Pikmin (which I almost missed!), and Splatoon adorning the windows. While three of the four photos showcase the impressive and thematic outside of the store, one of them gives us a look at the merch that will presumably be on sale\n\n\nAt a glance, we spot:\n\n\n\nGiant pipe statues\n\n\nPlush mushrooms and Mario characters/enemies\n\n\nT-shirts\n\n\nBags\n\n\n\nNintendo also gave us an official blog post, with a preview of more merch.\n\n\nIt's not going to be an all-comers situation though, at least at first. Nintendo notes that \"A total of 2,000 people will be invited to the pre-opening by lottery,\" where you can score visits on October 13 and 14.

          "description": "PS Plus Premium members are getting a neat extra perk for their subscription. Sony announced on PlayStation Blog that cloud streaming is coming for select PS5 titles later this month.  \n\n\nThese titles range from ones available on the PlayStation Plus catalog to digital purchases already in users' libraries and Game Trials. Supported titles range from the Resident Evil 4 remake to free-to-play games like Genshin Impact. In-game purchases are also available for streaming, which Sony compares to purchases from downloaded games.\n\n\nSome PS5 cloud streaming features include playing at up to 4K with HDR and access to the console's audio capabilities. Video capture is also available for up to 3 minutes along with screenshots.\n\n\nPS5 cloud streaming will launch worldwide in phases based on the region. Japan will receive the feature first on October 17 before reaching Europe on October 23. North America has the latest launch on October 30. The feature will only be available on PS5 consoles at launch.\n\n\nCloud streaming their games is a neat perk to the service for anyone with PS Plus Premium and is low on storage. Even with the PS5 Slim's 1TB of storage, many modern games are exorbitantly big, so being able to stream them could potentially mitigate storage issues at least a bit.\n\n\nWhether PS5 cloud streaming adds substantial value to PS Plus Premium is up to the individual player. Game Trials potentially benefit from this since they are more or less extended demos, meaning far less time investment. Even so, PS cloud streaming can be spotty even with great internet. \n\n\nHopefully, any benefits from streaming PS5 titles will outweigh the cons that come with it. Its use will vary with each subscriber's internet speed, but ideally, it helps avoid lengthy download times.\n\nThe post PS5 cloud streaming goes live this month for PS Plus Premium appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Sony has announced what games are being added to their various PlayStation Plus tiers this month, and buried with the rest of their Classics Catalog additions is I.Q. Final. It will be arriving on October 17.\n\n\nI.Q. Final is the sequel to 1997’s I.Q.: Intelligent Qube, which you may remember from PS1 demo discs. It’s a fantastic little game that presents a great challenge, terrific music, and a tremendous blow to your self-esteem. It has you dropping bomb tiles to try and clear a path through a rolling stack of blocks. Don’t blow up the forbidden tiles, though. Each one you accidentally destroy drops a row from the platform you’re standing on, which dwindles throughout, drastically cutting down the time you have to surgically clear a path through the blocks.\n\n\nThe 1998 sequel was never released in North America. It was released in Japan as Kurushi Final: Mental Blocks and Europe as I.Q. Final. Even with its various PlayStation Network releases, it never made it over here. The sequel comes with four modes: 100 Attack, Survival, Create, and Final. 100 Attack has you take on individual puzzles, Survival is an endless mode, and Final is the classic design.\n\n\nI recently discovered the greatness of I.Q.: Intelligent Qube. After I completed it, I then immediately researched where I could go next, only to find none of the sequels came to North America. This includes 2000’s I.Q. Remix+ and 2006’s I.Q. Mania. So, finally getting I.Q. Final is an absolute treat.\n\n\nUnless they leave it in PALs 50hz format. And unless they make it only available to Premium subscribers. I have to admit, Sony has a great vector on hurting my feelings.\n\n\nI.Q. Final joins the PlayStation Classics Catalog on October 17.\n\nThe post I.Q.

This set involves a bunch of horror games, just in time for Hallowe’en. It's definitely not a bad mix, but the Classic Catalog line-up is anemic, as usual. On the other hand, I'm surprised by one particular game's inclusion.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nHere are the titles joining Extra and Premium:\n\n\n\nAlien: Isolation\n\n\nGotham Knights\n\n\nHouse of Ashes\n\n\nOutlast 2\n\n\nDisco Elysium: The Final Cut\n\n\nDead Island: Definitive Edition\n\n\nElite Dangerous\n\n\nFar: Changing Tides\n\n\nGungrave G.O.R.E.\n\n\nEldest Souls\n\n\nRoki\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Classic Catalog additions are as follows:\n\n\n\nTekken 6 (PS3)\n\n\nSoulcalibur: Broken Destiny (PSP)\n\n\nApe Escape Academy (PSP)\n\n\nI.Q. Final (PS1)\n\n\n\nThis certainly is a decent bunch of additions, but with the recent PlayStation Plus price hike, there’s no way I’ll be touching the Extra and Premium tiers. Even the Classic Catalog additions are better than the usual fare, with I.Q. Final being an especially interesting addition. I can only hope that the PS1 and PSP titles are available piecemeal, which is never guaranteed with Sony.\n\n\nAs for new games, Alien: Isolation is one of my favorite horror games. Elite Dangerous is a rather robust space exploration game from a legendary series. Disco Elysium is one I haven’t gotten around to because I’m afraid it might be too depressing for my mindset. Meanwhile, I really don’t like Dead Island.

          "description": "Alan Wake 2 is almost upon us. After 13 years, fans will soon experience the sequel to the cult horror Xbox 360 hit. If you're excited about the game, would you be interested in a free copy? Let me rephrase: would you be interested in a free copy if you're already purchasing a new graphics card?\n\n\nThat's what Nvidia is currently offering, at least. If you're in the market for some current-gen graphical firepower, and you want some survival horror goodness to go with it, you can get Alan Wake 2 free with purchases of select GPUs.\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the Nvidia website, you'll be eligible if you buy an RTX 4070, 4070 Ti, 4080, and 4090 (if you feel like splashing out). It's not just PCs, either. A laptop powered by the mobile versions of the 4070, 4080, and 4090 graphics chips also qualify.\n\n\nT's and C's apply\n\n\nNvidia is offering this bundle until November 13, so you have a couple of weeks after the game comes out to take advantage of it. Of course, not everyone can afford brand-new hardware right now, but if you are looking to upgrade, this might be an enticing offer. Do check the site for full terms and conditions, though.\n\n\nAlan Wake 2 is also one of the few games that features version 3.5 of Nvidia's DLSS upscaling tech. As such, it kind of makes sense that Team Green would want to partner with developer Remedy Entertainment.\n\n\nAs for the game itself, we're fast approaching spooky season, so horror is going to be everywhere by the time Halloween rolls around. Fans of the original are no doubt looking forward to the much-anticipated sequel. Hell, even I'm keen to check it out, and I wasn't a huge fan of Alan Wake to begin with.\n\nThe post You can get Alan Wake 2 for free, but you have to buy an Nvidia 4000 GPU appeared first on Destructoid.",

In a public statement, Paradox Interactive revealed they would be writing down capitalized development cost on the turn-based RPG. The publisher announced it plans to write down MSEK 171, or roughly $15.7 million USD.\n\n\n\n\nPer Investopedia, a write-down is an accounting action that reduces the value of an asset to offset a loss or expense. The write-down is based on a revised sales forecast established after the game's release.\n\n\nThe statement goes on to reveal the capitalized development costs of The Lamplighters League to be MSEK 320, which equates to about $30 million USD. The newly revised sales forecast puts the fourth quarter profit impact estimates for the game at MSEK -248, which is just shy of $23 million USD.\n\n\n\n\"The Lamplighters League is a fun game with many strengths. Even though we see cautiously positive player numbers in subscription services, the commercial reception has been too weak, which is frankly a big disappointment. Game projects are by their nature always risky, but at the end of the day we haven’t performed at the level we should. It is painful but makes us more eager to roll up our sleeves and do better.\"\n-Fredrik Wester, CEO of Paradox Interactive\n\n\n\nEssentially, Paradox is saying The Lamplighters League is off to a slower start, so it's writing down expenses as a loss it doesn't expect to immediately recoup. Paradox Interactive is a publicly traded company. As such, they are obliged to disclose this information pursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation (EU nr 596/2014).\n\n\nAs a reminder here, The Lamplighters League just released a week ago on October 3. Hopefully, this is just Paradox Interactive mitigating its own economic risk, and not a sign of things to come in a recently hectic industry.\n\nThe post Paradox is taking a write-down on The Lamplighters League appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Whispergames and Onion Soup Interactive have announced that the long-anticipated microgame masher Super 56 is finished cooking and is out the door. It’s available on PC starting today.\n\n\nI tried out Super 56 during last February’s Steam Next Fest and came away impressed. It was scheduled to hit Early Access that same month but was delayed. The team has now decided to completely skip Early Access and just drop the piping-hot finished product right into your lap.\n\n\n\n\nSuper 56 is a WarioWare-like rush of microgames. As the name implies, there’s 56 of the little experiences, but the twist is that you control them with only one button. This one button does a lot of heavy lifting, as the short games run the gamut between racing and archery. Similar to WarioWare, it’s filled with some extremely unhinged humor and nostalgia-tickling references to older games.\n\n\nI’ve been playing it before release, and it’s fantastic. A full review should be coming in the next few days. I just wish I could get the theme out of my head.\n\n\nYou won’t be taking a big chance if you don’t wait for my review. Super 56 is available on Steam for the reasonable price of $6.99. Those butts aren’t going to shoot themselves.\n\nThe post Bizarre one-button microgame collection Super 56 launches today appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Dotemu has announced the arrival of a new content update for 2022’s Windjammers 2. While two new characters may seem like the most substantial addition, the fact that it’s getting a long-overdue tutorial mode is probably the most important.\n\n\nI reviewed Windjammers 2 back at launch and thought it was okay. Above-average, mainly helped by its reasonable asking price. However, there were a lot of areas that needed more love. In particular, the game had no tutorial. Instead, it gave you a PowerPoint presentation on the basics, then shoved you out the door to compete with no experience. With the update, there will be a lessons mode, as well as a simple practice. I really can’t believe it’s taken this long.\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking of long overdue, the update also comes with crossplay and lobbies. The press release notes that the rankings will be wiped along with these additions, so you’ll need to warm your Frisbee arm back up if you want to climb to the top.\n\n\nBeyond that, two new characters are being added to Windjammers 2. The first is Anna Szalinski from Poland. She’s a weightlifter, and I really dig how one of her idle animations is to drop and do pushups. The second character is a bit more exotic. It’s the android Jamma GX03 who looks cool and is compatible with the semi-universal standard for amusement machines.\n\n\nThe update for Windjammers 2 is available today on PC and consoles. For the next two weeks, the base game will be marked down 50% on Steam, Nintendo eShop, and with a PlayStation Plus subscription.\n\nThe post Free update for Windjammers 2 includes new characters and a proper tutorial appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Strictly Limited Games and ININ have announced Irem Collection Volume 3. It’s set for Q2 2024 on Switch, PlayStation, and Xbox, which gives time for the first two collections to actually be released.\n\n\nIrem Collection Volume 3 will include Mr. Heli, Mystic Riders, and Dragon Breed, which are all scrolling shoot-’em-ups. To be fair, that’s sort of what Irem was known for. Mr. Heli released in arcades in 1987. It was known in North America as Battle Chopper. Mystic Riders is similar to the Cotton series in that it involves piloting a broomstick. Finally, Dragon Breed is perhaps the most unique of the bunch because it has you riding on a big Asian-style serpent dragon.\n\n\n\n\nAs a reminder, Irem Collection Volume 1 includes Image Fight, Image Fight 2, and X Multiply (which was a spin-off of the Image Fight series). Irem Collection Volume 2 includes Air Duel, but breaks from the pack by also bundling Gun Force and Gun Force 2, which are run-and-guns considered precursors to the Metal Slug series.\n\n\nEach collection includes an assortment of filters, leaderboards, rewind, and save states. All of the collections will be available digitally, but you can get them physically from Strictly Limited Games in limited and collector’s edition flavors.\n\n\nIrem Collection Volume 3 currently has a broad release date of Q2 2024. However, Irem Collection Volume 1 is right around the corner and will release on November 21, 2023, on PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch.\n\nThe post Strictly Limited announces the included games for Irem Collection Volume 3 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "After years of hope, Valve finally released Counter-Strike 2 towards the end of September. The game – which sees it replacing CS:GO – exploded in popularity overnight. However, for those on older systems, the updated version of the iconic FPS will no longer be supported.\n\n\nIn a recent post on the Steam Support page, the message reads that Valve will cease supporting Counter-Strike 2 on \"older hardware, including DirectX 9 and 32-bit operating systems.\" So if you're still running Windows XP or older, you're going to be out of luck.\n\n\n\n\nFor those on Mac, things seem worse. The post goes on to say that the developer will \"no longer support macOS\" at all. These outdated PCs and the total macOS users only account for around one percent of players, Valve says.\n\n\nInstead, you'll get this...\n\n\nWhile Counter-Strike 2 will be moving forward with exclusively 64-bit Windows and Linux operating systems, those who are on older machines are being offered a 'legacy version' of CS:GO. However, support for this will only be ongoing until January 1, 2024, though the game will \"still be available.\"\n\n\nThis legacy version is a \"frozen build\" of CS:GO and will come with all the features of the game, just not official matchmaking. Valve says those who can no longer play Counter-Strike 2 are eligible for \"Prime Status Upgrade\" refunds, though there are some provisos to that.\n\n\nDespite the hype surrounding this updated version of the legendary Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, the game currently has a \"Mixed\" review score on Steam. Some of this could be due to CS:GO no longer being available, and the removal of support for macOS and older PCs might see further criticisms heading the game's way.\n\nThe post Counter-Strike 2 ending support for macOS and older PCs appeared first on Destructoid.",

The 1987 movie was a surprisingly grey look at corporate overreach, gentrification, the role of police, and the nature of humanity, among other things. Those themes, as well as the ultra-violence depicted, make it strange that it would be adapted into a children’s cartoon.

          "description": "A burning question resting on fans' minds since The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom released is where all the Guardian tech disappeared to after Breath of the Wild's events. Although some time passed between installments, the Guardians' omission feels odd, given their previous prevalence.\n\n\nNow there's an official answer given by Tears of the Kingdom director Hidemaro Fujibayashi, and it's uneventful. He stated in an interview with Telegraph that the Guardians \"disappeared after the Calamity was defeated (sealed).\"\n\n\n\"All of the people of Hyrule also witnessed this, but there is no one who knows the mechanism or reason why they disappeared, and it is considered a mystery,\" said Fujibayashi. \"It is believed that since the Calamity disappeared, they also disappeared as their role had been fulfilled.\"\n\n\nFujibayashi then acknowledged how common \"mysterious occurrences and phenomena\" are to Hyrule's various races. It's why nobody saw this as any cause for concern since odd events are just part of everyday life.\n\n\n\n\nHe finishes his in-world explanation by stating how many Hyrule residents accept that \"ancient Sheikah technology\" was responsible. Many also saw it as something not worth delving into. He concluded by mentioning how both titles' civilizations are completely different, and the team based each title's concepts on the respective civilizations.\n\n\nOn Tears of the Kingdom's design, Fujibayashi said the team aimed to give players an \"exhilarating and happy experience\" while exploring the Sky Islands. Meanwhile, the Depths were to provide \"tension\" to players exploring.\n\n\nThe official explanation for the Guardians' disappearance in Zelda being that they just left and nobody cared is honestly hilarious. It'll likely be a while before we see them again as The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom won't have any post-launch content.\n\nThe post Zelda director explains where all the Guardian tech went after Breath of the Wild appeared first on Destructoid.",

It’s sent to launch “this holiday season,” which, judging from the seasonal stock in most department stores, started sometime in July.\n\n\nI can’t believe it’s been nearly three years since the launch of the PlayStation 5. For the longest time, it was hard to even get your hands on one. If you were someone who persevered and got a launch model, here’s the inevitable spit in your eye.\n\n\n\n\nIt’s not that bad, though. The slimmer PS5 model doesn’t have any more horsepower and is coming fitted with the same size hard drive (1TB). The reveal trailer doesn’t really show off any comparison between the two models, which is because there’s not tremendous difference. It’s described as having reduced “more than 30%, and weight by 18% and 24%.” So, it’s definitely leaner in line with the PS4 or PS3 redesigns. The launch model PS5 was a pretty chonky beast, so I’m sure your shelves will thank you.\n\n\nIt comes in both disc and all-digital versions, though the digital version will now have an option to add an Ultra HD Blu-ray Disc Drive. The vertical stand is sold separately for some reason. \n\n\nThe slimmer model PS5 will start showing up in stores “this holiday season.” The price remains $499.99 USD for the disc model, and 449.99 USD for the discless one.\n\nThe post Sony reveals a new, slimmer PS5 model for this holiday season appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Despite its remarkable lore and crisp gunplay, Destiny 2 plays host to no small number of imperfections. Some of these problems have been around for literal years, to the point where players actively avoid anything to do with them. One of the most (in)famous examples of this is Destiny 2's Attrition activity modifier. After hundreds upon hundreds of hours in the game, it's looking like a bigger issue than most first anticipated. In fact, it's holding back Destiny 2's core gameplay loop.\n\n\nFor those who might not be in the know, Attrition is a special gameplay mutator that comes into play in select activities. When it's active, it massively slows down the Guardians' passive health and shield regeneration as a baseline. To alleviate this, killing enemies will sometimes generate special Light…",

They’ve previously released reproductions of Sega Genesis/Mega Drive controllers, as well as wired and wireless variants of the Sega Saturn controllers themselves.

          "description": "Nighthawk Interactive has announced that they’ll be publishing Pui Pui Molcar Let’s! Molcar Party! in North America and Europe on November 21. It’s set for release on Switch.\n\n\nOriginally published by Bandai Namco in Japan and developed by Groove Box Japan, I’m just learning of this show featuring potato cars now. I had to look it up, but apparently, it’s popular in an internet sort of way, but I’ve never seen it. I would probably have remembered potato cars.\n\n\n\n\nThe potato cars are actually rodent-car hybrids, with the “mol” part of the title coming from the Japanese word morumotto, which means Guinea Pig. Pui Pui Molcar Let’s! Molcar Party! is a party game based on the concept, and it looks so weirdly compelling. I think it’s poking the same spot in my brain that Choro Q tends to jab at. Cute rodent cars living in a little playset city? Sign me up.\n\n\nThe art style in Pui Pui Molcar Let’s! Molcar Party! is also really charming, featuring felt-like fur on all the potato cars and a sort of stop-motion jerkiness to their animations. Beyond playing minigames involving dancing or playing cops and robbers, you can also observe/feed the potato cars and even pet them. You can dress them up and take photos of them. It’s a game that looks wholesome and cute while also having a bizarre, unhinged quality.\n\n\nPui Pui Molcar Let’s! Molcar Party! is set to release for Switch in North America and Europe on November 21. It’s been out in Japan since late 2021.\n\nThe post Pui Pui Molcar Let’s!

Both the disc drive model and the digital model will be updated, but these two models aren't as different as they used to be: you will now be able to purchase a disc drive separately, allowing you to upgrade a digital model to a disc-compatible version. Both versions will be available this November, and will eventually replace the current model of PS5 altogether.\n\"The new PS5 has been reduced in volume by more than 30%, and weight by 18% and 24% compared to the previous models,\" the PlayStation blog post reads. It also mentions that the new covers have different textures, which isn't immediately clear from the pictures. \"There are four separate cover panels,\" it says, \"with the top portion in a glossy look, while the bottom remains in matte.\" This does raise questions about the compatibility of console shells Sony currently sells that allow you to change the look of your console, but this question is not addressed in the announcement.\nThe slim PS5 with a disc drive will still cost $499.99. The PS5 digital edition retails at $449.99, a $50 increase from the original digital edition. \nIf you do buy a newer digital version and decide to upgrade it to a disc version, the drive will cost you $79.99 in the US, €119.99 in Europe, £99.99 in the UK, and ¥11,980 in Japan. The total cost of a digital console and a disc drive is a little more expensive than buying a disc drive version outright. The console will include a new horizontal stand to set the console on its side, and a vertical stand will be on sale for $29.99 USD | 29.99 EURO | 24.99 GBP | 3,980 JPY.

Wonder was met with many excited reactions; the art direction, the music, and the new enemies all looked like fun evolutions of what fans had grown accustomed to in the New Super Mario Bros. series. However, it was the final shot of the trailer that garnered the biggest reaction, as Mario grabbed an odd-looking fruit and turned into a massive elephant version of himself. Elephant Mario, who appears larger than life on our current cover art, quickly became one of the most recognizable elements of Super Mario Bros. Wonder.\nPlayers won't need to wait long to play as Elephant Mario, as it appears in the very first stage, Welcome to the Flower Kingdom.

          "description": "Microsoft's long journey to acquire gaming giant Activision Blizzard is finally nearing an end. According to The Verge, a source familiar with Microsoft's plans indicated that it was aiming for Friday, October 13, as a date to close the deal. Ignoring the infamy of the date (it seems Microsoft and Activision Blizzard executives aren't very superstitious), it's not a surprising day to choose. Back in July, the two parties in the deal jointly agreed to extend the deadline of their agreement to October 18 in order to sort out any further regulatory concerns. At the time of publishing, that date is only twelve days away, so the deal would have to be closed soon.\nStill, the Microsoft legal department will have to deal with a few more legal challenges before they're completely out of the woods. After restructuring the terms of the merger to grant Ubisoft the rights to stream Activision Blizzard games in the UK, the Competition and Markets Authority granted the deal a preliminary approval, but the regulator still has to make a final assessment sometime before October 18. Still, Microsoft and Activision Blizzard each took this as a major win.\nWe are encouraged by this positive development in the CMA’s review process. We presented solutions that we believe fully address the CMA’s remaining concerns related to cloud game streaming, and we will continue to work toward earning approval to close prior to the October 18…\nSeptember 22, 2023\nThis news followed the companies' victory over the Federal Trade Commission back in July. At this point, it seems fairly likely that the deal will go through, ending a saga that began almost two years ago. After documents from the hearings leaked and revealed Microsoft's hybrid console, a new Xbox model, and plans to acquire other companies like Sega and Bungie, Microsoft is probably ready to leave the entire matter behind it.\n[Source: The Verge]\nHow do you feel about the acquisition coming to a close?

From the acclaimed anime Cyberpunk: Edgerunners to the 2.0 update of 2077 and the release of Phantom Liberty, public perception of the series has largely turned around. Today, CD Projekt Red announced that they're taking the next step with the franchise – creating a live-action production.\nThe game studio is partnering with Anonymous Content, a media company known for its work on shows like Mr. Robot and films like The Revenant. The project will be produced by Garrett Kemble, David Levine, Ryan Schwartz, Bard Dorros, and Charlie Scully, who will develop the project \"in close collaboration with the Cyberpunk 2077 creative team.\" That said, this is still in the earliest stages; there's still no screenwriter attached to the project.\nThere are still many questions in the air about the project. They've yet to announce (and perhaps, decide) whether it will be a film or a series. And while the project is \"set in the world\" of Cyberpunk 2077, there are a lot of approaches they could take. No actors have been attached to the project either, so whether Keanu Reeves or Idris Elba will show up is still up in the air. You can read the full press release here.\nFor more Cyberpunk, here's what we thought of the latest expansion, Phantom Liberty, and here's a list of tips and tricks to help you get started.

Now, as part of Atari's Recharged lineup, it has revealed Berzerk: Recharged, and its coming to consoles and PC later this year. \nThe original Berzerk is an arcade game released in 1980. In it, players controlled a top-down avatar while shooting through hordes of armed robots in an electrified maze. The big bad was Evil Otto, who bounced around the maze as a giant smiley face, hunting players down. Atari says Otto is back in Berzerk: Recharged, \"bringing with him updated graphics, deft twin-stick controls, and a new soundtrack by the acclaimed Megan McDuffee.\" \nCheck out Berzerk: Recharged for yourself in the announcement trailer below: \n\n\n\"Though he sports an ominous grin…",

It did so today with a short teaser trailer showing Lego-fied versions of fan-favorite Animal Crossing characters like Isabelle and Tom Nook. However, the teaser doesn't reveal exactly what to expect in terms of Lego sets or when we might see this collaboration hit store shelves.\nThe tweet accompanying the teaser says, \"Welcome to...LEGO Animal Crossing!\" The video itself shows Isabelle and Tom Nook looking up at the Lego Animal Crossing sky before pulling out to show even more Animal Crossing characters. All of them are watching a gift rise into the sky by way of a balloon, in classic Animal Crossing fashion; somebody get them a slingshot or two. \nCheck out the Animal Crossing Lego teaser trailer for yourself below: \nWelcome to…LEGO Animal Crossing!#AnimalCrossing #LEGO #Nintendo pic.twitter.com/un3R7QwlRC\nOctober 5, 2023\nThis Animal Crossing collaboration with Lego isn't the first time Nintendo and Lego have worked together on Lego sets. The two have been steadily releasing different Super Mario sets for a few years now, with four Donkey Kong Lego sets releasing back in August. Even outside of Nintendo, Lego is no stranger to taking video game characters and turning them into Legos. It's been doing that with Sonic the Hedgehog Lego sets for a while now. \nAre you going to be picking up any of these Animal Crossing Legos when they release? Let us know in the comments below!",

It did so, and while the game looked great on both consoles, it was only playable at 30 FPS. PlayStation 5 owners were left wondering if Rockstar wasn't tapping into the power of the current-gen console to bring 60 FPS to the 13-year-old game. \nNow, weeks later, Rockstar has updated the PS4 port of Red Dead Redemption and the included Undead Nightmare DLC to include 60 FPS support on PS5 via backward compatibility. It did so randomly, with a quick tweet announcing the news. \nRed Dead Redemption, including Undead Nightmare, now supports up to 60 FPS on PlayStation 5 via backward compatibility. pic.twitter.com/XMLIe6gYo4\nOctober 4, 2023\nElsewhere in the same update, Rockstar added an option to enable subtitles upon first booting the game. The update also includes general bug fixes and improvements, although Rockstar didn't list which. \nIf you bought Red Dead Redemption on PS4 recently to play on PS5, or were looking for a reason to do so, this new update that adds a 60 FPS option might be the reason you were looking for. Now, Rockstar please bring 60 FPS to Red Dead Redemption II on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. And bring 60 FPS in Red Dead Redemption to Xbox Series X/S, too. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Red Dead Redemption review and then read our column on remembering the mundane greatness of John Marston.

After completing the game, it's safe to say that's definitely the case, with Mirage falling somewhere between where this franchise began and the modern RPGs of late.

To do so, he must rely on both himself and various copies of himself. \nToday, 11 Bit Studios released a new trailer of The Alters that gives us our first look at its gameplay, which highlights that it's a third-person, base-building survival game. The team says the story is \"driven by life-defining choices and exploring the diverse paths one could take\" after Jan crash-lands on an inhospitable planet turning toward a massive sun. \nCheck it out for yourself in The Alters gameplay trailer below: \n\n\n\"In this desperate race against time, Jan must harness local Rapidium crystals to create his many versions: the 'Alters',\" a press release reads. \"Set within an ever-moving mobile base, both teamwork and building a wide range of expertise are indispensable for survival. By selecting diverging paths for other Jans during the alteration process, they acquire distinct skill sets. They become invaluable, not only for maintaining the base, but also for tasks like cooking, crafting tools for surface exploration, and gathering essential resources.\" \n11 Bit Studios says the Alters are more than mere resources, though, as they are sentient beings with their own emotions, problems, goals, and sometimes, existential doubts about their purpose. \n\"Despite their differences, their collective goal is to escape, echoing Jan's determination to survive: I'll just do it all by myselves,\" the press release reads.\n\nThe Alters is due out on current-gen consoles and PC sometime in 2024. \nFor more, watch The Alters' reveal trailer here, and then read Game Informer's reviews of 11 Bit Studios' other games: This War of Mine, Frostpunk, and Children of Morta. \nAre you going to check out The Alters next year?

Now, Game Informer can exclusively reveal it hits PlayStation 5 on October 31, making this a great spooky experience for the holiday. \nFor the uninitiated, The Forest Cathedral is inspired by events surrounding real-life scientist Rachel Carson's investigation into Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, otherwise known as the harmful DDT pesticide. Publisher Whitethorn Games says this game is \"a dramatic reimagining of Carson's environmental science book, Silent Spring.\" \nYou can get a look at it in The Forest Cathedral PS5 release date trailer below: \n\n\nAs you can see in the trailer above, in The Forest Cathedral, players take on the role of Rachel in her new field research biologist position on a mysterious island. What begins as simply completing weekly work tasks becomes something more horrific when Rachel learns about what DDT is doing to the area. Whitethorn says players \"will slowly uncover the horrific effects of the pesticide using advanced environment technology to complete puzzles that weave together 3D exploration with 2D platforming.\" \n\nAs far as gameplay goes, players switch between Rachel Carson in a 3D world and the \"Little Man\" inside the 2D world of Rachel's scanning tools. It's in this 2D world where players will solve puzzles and complete platforming challenges.\nThe Forest Cathedral is available right now on Xbox Series X/S and PC via Steam.

It’s up to you to destroy them first! The tricky part is many ECDs are connected to each other and can regenerate instantly, so you must figure out the right order to successfully complete your mission. \nOur reimplementation of the Freescape engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Dark Side support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC. Additionally, there are two playable demos if you want to test the game. Support for Amiga and AtariST will be available later! Please contact us if you have some other release.\nTo play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build.
