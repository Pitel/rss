It's been steadily cranking out original titles, ports, and remasters on arcade and console since 1978, although it will likely never recapture the glory days of the 8- and 16-bit era. So prolific was its output that anyone who owned an NES or a SNES will have likely had multiple Sunsoft games in their collection. This Sunsoft is Back! bundle presents three titles released for the first time outside of Japan, beautifully emulated, and boasting a full English translation.\nFirst up is the fantastically titled Firework Thrower Kantaro's 53 Stations of the Tokaido. Playing as the titular explosive merchant, you must reach your fiancée in Edo, beset on all sides by a rival merchant's mercenary band. Kantaro’s adventure is a fun scrolling platformer of sorts, which has you dealing with tricky projectile-throwing arcs against enemies that bounce all over the place. Nailing a good shot against an approaching ninja is satisfying, but overall this one is a bit simplistic.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Reader, we were not disappointed (thanks for the tip, d-slice).\nNow, when most of us solve an Addison puzzle in TOTK, it's a simple case of slapping a nearby boulder underneath the President Hudson sign or, at most, building a rudimentary frame for it.

To fill the gap, an indie team called Tour De Pizza came out early last year with its own spiritual successor called Pizza Tower, offering a polished and thrilling adventure into a truly insane food-themed world. Since release, Pizza Tower has quickly built up a high reputation for its creativity and gameplay design, and now that it’s come to Switch, we’re pleased to report that it is indeed a fantastic platformer.\nPizza Tower places you in the role of Peppino Spaghetti, the chef and owner of a failing pizzeria who finds himself threatened by an evil sentient pizza named Pizzaface who lives nearby in the titular tower. Pizzaface has a laser on top of the tower which he’s going to use to destroy Peppino’s pizzeria, so our daring chef dashes off to climb the tower and destroy the evil pizza and his minions once and for all.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Graham always has his hands on the video game pulse, gliding them over Xwitter or Steam or wherever and waiting for that \"ker kun, ker kun\" of a new Cool Thing. And that cool thing is Bakeru, described by its Steam page as \"Japan-esque\", but is in actual fact, very Japanese. I mean, you travel around 47 Japanese prefectures as a metamorphing tanuki who bashes evilness with his taiko drum sticks. Come on.\nWhat I hadn't suspected was Bakeru's chops not only as a platformer, but as a means to increase your chances at success in pub quizzes. The game is a certified trivia Tardis, where you'll learn all sorts about Japanese culture as well as just like, the colour sepia being a genus of cuttlefish.\nRead more",

Ubiquitous wearable sci-fi shields repel any attack that comes in too fast, so everyone has to learn this unique, overtly dance-like form of close-quarters combat where every thrust and parry is necessarily slow and considered. Picture it: careful judgments of your movements, weighing up the right time to strike, every measured jab part of a wider strategy that culminates in the kill.\nMOBAs are like that. Both in the fights themselves, sort of, where probing lunges lead up to bursts of lethality, but more broadly in each match as a whole. They’re map-wide knife fights, where a thrust is a well-judged lane push and a parry a savvy item buy. At first, playing Smite 2 felt akin to watching on helplessly as my opponents repeatedly shoved their crysknives through my ribs. After 30 hours, it often still feels like that - but I am enjoying myself. Mostly. Despite Valve’s third-person elephant in the lane. \nRead more",

While approaches to 4X and grand strategy vary hugely between games, factions and players, the genre as a whole is firmly wedded to imperial conquest, both structurally and at the level of narrative aspects and set-dressing. Many 4X games are triumphal re-enactments of specific periods of colonial settlement and expansion. All of which is to say that Syphilisation is fascinating. It's a reworking of the genre which dismantles and reconstructs concepts such as diplomacy, research and production. It's also just left early access - find more details and a playthrough video below.\n Read more",

While it wasn't outstanding in the grander landscape of gaming, enough Warhammer 40K fans seem to have cherished the escapades of bulky blue boltgunner Demetrian Titus for the action game to merit a sequel a decade later. It left its story on something of a cliffhanger, with said hero being dragged away to face untold tortures by the Inquisition, the most zealous sect of this preternaturally paranoid sci-fi universe. Today, Titus is free again. Free to stomp towards hordes of alien foes, blast them with a plasma incinerator, and shred the stragglers with a chainsaw sword. Space Marine 2 is an often-satisfying scrapper that has me  convinced of 40K's merit as a crafting ground for excellent-looking environments and creatures, even if I'm not particularly moved by the bland character of Titus and his fellow Ultramarines.\nRead more",

The DLC is reportedly so bug-ridden that it’s taken many of the base game’s core systems down with it.\nGearbox - who acquired Risk Of Rain from Hopoo Games in 2022 - have since put out a blog with a list of known issues they’re targeting, and encourage players to keep submitting bug reports.

          "description": "In the first post for my series on \"saving\" open world design, I complained that many of today's open worlds feel like checklists of formulaic tasks and rewards, their geography a vaporous staging ground for itemisable, cycling content-gathering opportunities, which flies in the face of the sense of freedom and wonder they're supposed to inspire. My interviewees, Elder Scrolls veterans Matt Firor and Nate Purkeypile, argued that this reflects the expense and scale of today's open world productions, which constrains experimental design both at a practical level and in terms of overall direction.\nCD Projekt open world designer Jakub Tomczak doesn't, as far as I know, have an answer to the issue of production bloat, but he does have a disarmingly obvious solution to the 'checklist problem', based on his time creating missions for Cyberpunk 2077 and its Phantom Liberty expansion: get better at hiding the checklist. Weave it into the landscape and setting more artfully, with an elegant balance of randomisation and responsiveness to the player's behaviour which keeps everything fresh. \r\n\n \nRead more",

The game was a bright spot in a bad time, which might seem peculiar given that Sluggish Morss often looks like a whale's upset stomach, but it's such a feverishly inventive creation. It blew the dust from my synapses.\nThe same appears true of King-Spooner's upcoming Judero, on which he is collaborating with Soul Searching developer Talha Kaya. It casts you as a \"pagan seer\" armed with a big stick, who is searching the mythical Scottish borderlands for evil creatures to clobber. It looks cheerier and airier than Sluggish Morss, with a more overt emphasis on mechanics such as combat, but it has the same pickled 3am energy to it. It's also now got a release date - 16th September - and a new trailer below.\r\n \nRead more",

He is, however, never stepped upon by a mech with a missile launcher. He is never given a shotgun and tasked with shooting the other animals.

          "description": "Almost a decade after his acrimonious departure from Konami, the shadow of Hideo Kojima still looms over Metal Gear Solid. He's there, barely camouflaged, in the undergrowth of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater - a remake of the fifth Metal Gear game, originally released in 2004, which tells the tale of a lone US special operator hunting superweapons and old mentors in the jungles of the southern Soviet Union. \r\n\n\r\nI say \"remake\" but this feels more like a re-release, in spirit. True, it now runs on Unreal Engine, with the option of a manual, third-person perspective and cover-shooter controls in addition to the old top-down viewpoints. Yes, it boasts new flourishes, such as wounds now leaving scars, and clothes picking up stray leaves. Yes, there's a new interface with floating in-world menus, which makes shuffling between the layers a bit less awkward. It's the product of much labour, with development split between Konami and external support partner Virtuos. But where Konami's other big restoration project, Bloober's Silent Hill 2 remake, is a creative dialogue with the original game, Delta seems consumed by faithfulness to Kojima's original design.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It’s also not a terribly accurate one. From what I saw of the game, Dinolords is more about the lords than the dinos, having as much in common with Diablo-style ARPGs as it does with classic strategy. And that’s a distinction which might just elevate it out of novelty status.\nRead more",

It's also a free-to-play game, and I have the usual unanswered questions about currencies and gacha, but I'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt for the minute, because I have not spent nearly enough of my life considering the tactical applications of ballgowns.

(It came out in 1997, and as such, I think the statute of limitations on spoilers has passed, but if you still intend to play, stop reading now.) The mission completes the long arc of foreshadowing begun by the intro's mention that capital-class spacecraft have been outlawed, following a ruinous war. It turns out that one particular evil corpo has been sneakily building one of these megaships - not only that, but you get to fly inside it, cannons ablazing. It was while doing so that teenage me realised the true exceptionality of the Video Game Artform. You can't fly inside capital ships in, like, symbolist poems or baroque symphonies, can you? You can't fly in poems or symphonies at all, unless you do so metaphorically - \"metaphor\" being a kind of poor man's graphics card.\nThe technology of flight simming has advanced mightily since G-Police's day. For instance: in Everspace 2's just-announced Titans DLC, you get to fly inside not just regular old spaceships, but massive space kaiju with procedurally generated digestive systems. Here's the trailer.\nRead more",

You can, quite literally, go on tours curated by historians around each of the game's respective maps. Instead of diving off a Sphinx and plunging your hidden blade into someone's spinal column, you can look up at the Sphinx and read a paragraph on its significance. Maybe view an actual, real life bit of ancient Egypt from an actual real life museum collection in-game. Perhaps embody an Anglo-Saxon lad in Valhalla, instead, and like, cook up some nettle soup having just got a fresh \"Friar Tuck\" at the local hair choppers (no guarantees on this last bit).\nThis is all to say that Black Myth: Wukong deserves such a mode, too. There were so many times throughout my review time where I stopped and stared and wondered as to something's meaning. Not only in the architecture, but in the characters, too. So here I am with a proposition: how about instead of thwacking things with my staff, I can use it as a walking stick and point it at things I want to learn about.\nRead more",

Well, some of the minds behind Unravel are working on new game called Hela. This time it's less about yarn and more about being a small mouse who does parkour. Still, it does retain some of the bodily gymnastics of its predecessor. Namely the use of tongues as bungee ropes.\nRead more",

Whether plundering the earth in SteamWorld Dig 2 or mucking about with magic in SteamWorld Quest, these are solid and approachable adventures that enthusiastically embrace whatever theme the developers have decided upon. Cowboys? Sure. Wizards? Why not. It barely matters, as long as it results in some good puns. As a studio, Thunderful have a reputation for hopping from one style of game to the next, boiling entire genres down to their essence, and reconstituting them with competence and style to exist within a now-familiar steampunk world of colourful pals and Saturday morning cartoon jokes. The studio is a perpetual notion machine. Yes, with SteamWorld Heist 2, they're revisiting the sci-fi bullet-bouncing of their 2016 tactics game SteamWorld Heist, but they're also introducing significant changes to create a compulsive XCOM-like full of sea-faring submariners that may be their best work yet, even against a back catalogue of blinders. \nRead more",

I dare boldly to maintain that there is such a thing as Too Wide, a point beyond which the extra visual estate becomes a waste of electricity, unless you watch the screen in pairs. I can only assume people who use ultrawide monitors live in constant terror of flanking manoeuvres and demand the maximum amount of peripheral vision. Mind you, I tend to play games with my nose about 10 centimetres from the screen. Forget being flanked - it's the prospect of snipers up ahead I'm worried about.\nIf you're among the people who fret excessively about flankers, I've got great news from Uncle BioWare. Forthcoming RPG Dragon Age: The Veilguard will support 21:9 ultrawide monitors. The ultrawide functionality extends to cinematics - you can disable \"cinematic aspect ratios\" to switch off the black bars that otherwise hem in the view. It's one of several PC-specific flourishes they've just blogged about. Have a look.\n Read more",

Unfortunately for James, he accidentally walked straight into Gamescom. “I’m starting to think that there are a lot of video games” he informed us yesterday. Horrifying if true. Still, it does sound like he’s managing to have some fun there, mainly by hitting up Saber Interactive COO and former id Software co-owner Tim Willits for some top tips on how to avenge Edwin’s thieving ways.\nTips about kill-stealing aside, James found time to ask Willits about Space Marine 2's microtransactions, and whether there was any nervousness returning to a cult hit series… especially one a lot of people had almost given up on ever seeing again. “Even the “push forward” combat of the original was part of [id’s] inspiration when we created Doom 2016,” answered Willits. “So for me personally, it’s this huge circle. It’s always intimidating working on a franchise that people love.” But, with the right team, technology, and vision he says, “it just comes together.”\nRead more",

It certainly has more polish and some extra additions, yet I didn't come away from it thrilled by its more competitive, class-based FPS leanings.

          "description": "Ač to podle počasí nevypadá, prázdniny skončily. Nesmutněte však, neboť již tento čtvrtek bude Virtuální Bastlírna - setkání elektroniků, bastlířů, ajťáků a všech milovníků techniky! Jaké novinky a témata tam čekají? Nový procesor na trhu zpravidla vzruší jen uživatele PC, největší novinka tohoto měsíce se týká spíše bastlířů. Raspberry vydalo nový procesor RP2350, který je výrazným vylepšením původního RP2040. Kromě Arm Cortex M33 jader skrývá také RISC-V jádra a značné množství zajímavých digitálních periferií. Ač oficiální desky ještě nejsou dostupné, samozřejmě se strahovákům procesor i tak dostal do rukou a možná i do hledáčku elektronových mikroskopů. A poví si i proč má nový Bus Pirate s tímto procesorem lehké trable a jaké zajímavosti se nachází v erratě procesoru.\r\n\r\nTím samozřejmě novinky nekončí - ještě se bastlíři zmíní o novém nativním konfiguračním nástroji pro síťové prvky od Mikrotiku a o podpoře jednovrstvých plošných spojů v Altiu. Protože jsou ale bastlíři, nezapomenou i na čistě hardwarová témata.\r\n\r\nZe světa hardwaru ukáží nejen novinky nebo praktické poznatky ohledně minimalistických sad nářadí, které se dají vždy nosit s sebou, ale i pár lehce \"retro\" projektů. Vznikla například replika klávesnice k počítači Ondra a ke starým osciloskopům se dá v současnosti koupit emulátor disketové mechaniky, který používá standardní USB flash disky.\r\n\r\nA jak je zvykem, mají strahováci nachystaná i obskurní až bizarní témata, kupříkladu simulátor 555 na Attiny, čínské klony karet MIFARE Classic s nedokumentovaným backdoorem nebo velice osobité útržky z legendární knihy Rozeberte si PC.\r\n\r\nPříští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat ve čtvrtek 5. září od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.",

          "description": "We've seen it all from the Skyrim community. We've had everything from new quests, better visuals, bug fixes, and that one mod that turns the Giant Spiders into a creepy looking Spider-Man, complete with gangly limbs. But maybe it's time we had something more scatological in our TES5 experience. Or so one person felt, at least.\n\n\nIn what can only be described as something of a head-scratching moment, Nexus Mods user nakano52 decided to replace Skyrim's vegetation with literal poo. Referred to as DIY (or Doo Ingredients Yuk), this mod is potentially suited for those who often find themselves thinking, \"there's not enough shit on my travels\" while adventuring across Tamriel.\n\n\nImage via nakano52/Nexus Mods.\n\n\nSpecifically, nakano52 says the mod replaces shrubs and plants \"at a certain rate,\" whatever that means. However, it's not just for the aesthetic grossness of it, though the modder admits they thought it would be fun to see vast piles of poop in the game.\n\n\nNot quite healing powers\n\n\nYou see, Doo Ingredients Yuk does have something of a purpose. As noted in the name, the piles of plants-cum-feces can actually be harvested for those who consider themselves quite the budding alchemist.\n\n\nWhat can it be used for in this context? Why, nothing more than a simple poison, of course. According to the description page, poop has a gold value of one, a weight capacity of 0.1, and has the following effects:\n\n\n\nRavage Health\n\n\nLingering Damage Health\n\n\nLingering Damage Magicka\n\n\nLingering Damage Stamina\n\n\n\nThere are, however, a few additional mods you'll need to download and install before this one will work, such as SkyPatcher and Base Object Swapper. Other than that, you're good to go, because we've all run out of things to do in Skyrim, it seems. Not that I'm above a poop-based modification, you understand.\n\nThe post Here’s a Skyrim mod that replaces vegetation with poop, because why not at this stage? appeared first on Destructoid.",

No Man's Sky update 4.2 added the option in the game for players to locate crashed Sentinel Interceptor ships, fix them, and make them their own.\n\n\nImage via Hello Games\n\n\nSentinel Interceptor\n\n\nLike regular starships, Sentinel Interceptors also have varying designs, and differ in class type. Since the process of obtaining a Sentinel Interceptor is not as straightforward as simply running into a ship you like and buying it, it is all the more difficult to find an S-class Sentinel Interceptor in No Man’s Sky.\n\n\nFinding Sentinel Interceptor crash site\n\n\nThere are two ways to find crashed Sentinel Interceptor ships in No Man’s Sky. \n\n\nImage via Hello Games\n\n\nAI Carrier Fragment\n\n\nThe first way is to find Carrier AI Fragment, which can be found by defeating a Sentinel Capital Ship. Once you have a Carrier AI Fragment, interact with it in inventory, and it will reveal the location of a crashed Sentinel Interceptor on the current planet.\n\n\nEcho Locator\n\n\nAnother way of finding a Sentinel Interceptor in No Man’s Sky is through the use of an Echo Locator. You can find an Echo Locator by destroying Dissonant Resonators. This locator can then be used to find a Harmonic Camp. After you solve the Harmonic Interface puzzle, you will get the option to “Locate Dissonance Spikes\". This will reveal the location of a Sentinel Interceptor crash site.\n\n\nImage via Hello Games\n\n\nYou can also use the Echo Locator method to find multiple ships on the same planet by ensuring that you activate the Echo Locator a couple of hours away from the previous crash site.\n\n\nOnce you reach the crashed site, you have to repair the Sentinel Interceptor, and you can then claim it for yourself. If you don’t like the Sentinel Interceptor you find, you can also salvage it for units and components.\n\nThe post No Man’s Sky: How to get a Sentinel Interceptor appeared first on Destructoid.",

Pull it off, and you get 3 points added to your total. \n\n\nThankfully, using athletes with high 3-point shooting attributes will reduce that risk and increase your chances for success.\n\n\nBest 3-point shooters in NBA 2K25\n\n\nFiguring out the top 10 NBA 2K25 players when it comes to 3-point shooting is pretty straightforward. I have used the 3-Point attribute to judge the 10 best names currently available in the latest rosters. Do note that the ranking has been done on the basis of the 3-point attribute values and not according to their overalls.\n\n\nPlayer Name\n3-Point Rating\nOVR \n\n\n\n\nStephen Curry\n99\n95\n\n\nGrayson Allen\n93\n78\n\n\nKevin Durant\n92\n94\n\n\nKlay Thompson\n89\n81\n\n\nMike Conley\n89\n81\n\n\nLuke Kennard\n89\n76\n\n\nLuka Doncic\n88\n97\n\n\nDesmond Bane\n88\n83\n\n\nBuddy Hield\n88\n79\n\n\nNormal Powell\n88\n79\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStephen Curry is unsurprisingly the one with the best 3-point shooting inside the entire game. He will be the best bet to score the high-risk throws. Just make sure to get the distance, timing, and coverage right, and you should be scoring most of your baskets.\n\n\nKevin Durant's recent seasons might not have been exemplary, but he remains a formidable bet when it comes to 3-point shooting. The same can also be said about Mavs' Luka Doncic.

          "description": "The shot meter has undergone a massive change in NBA 2K25, as developer Visual Concepts not only gave the feature a new UI makeover but changed up how the meter feels, too. \n\n\nYou'll no longer have the old meter system with a green portion towards the top. Instead, the visual cue is now available as an arrow/ring/circle to help time shots better. Like NBA 2K24, the shot meter, or its current iteration, is always on by default. However, now the gauge can be toggled either off or on, in addition to its new visual options.  \n\n\nHow to disable the shot meter in NBA 2K25\n\n\nYou can make the change from either the MyTeam or MyCareer settings. \n\n\n\nGo to \"Settings\".\n\n\nChoose \"Customize HUD\".\n\n\nSelect \"Shot Meter Shots\".\n\n\nThe first three options in this section deal with the visibility of the shot meter. They're basic shots, layups, and free throws.\n\n\nYou have to turn off the jump meter for the different shots manually.\n\n\n\nThat's all you have to do to remove the shot meter from being activated when you attempt any throw.\n\n\nImage via Destructoid\n\n\nShould you turn off the shot meter in NBA 2K25?\n\n\nDespite a change in its old shape, the shot meter is pretty helpful for beginners. However, I certainly feel that the old meter was much more useful. Adjusting to the new arrow can be tricky, and I have actually switched to the ring meter.\n\n\nThat said, you'll get a 10% bonus for a successful basket for every green-timed shot with the meter turned off. In the long run, you'll want to learn to time the throws on your own without having to rely on the meter. It's not only for the success bonus; every good player knows the art of timing your throws to score a basket in NBA 2K25.\n\n\nHence, turning off the meter is the way to go forward, even if you might struggle to time your throws at first. I have the meter turned on for layups and free throws only. For jump shots, I depend on my sense of timing and the visual cue from player animations on the screen.\n\nThe post How to turn off shot meter for NBA 2K25 appeared first on Destructoid.",

According to Zeekerss, he's been spending a lot of time working on another project, titled Welcome to the Dark Place, with hopes of finishing it soon.\n\n\nThe last two versions were mostly bug fixes, and so is Version 64, but with at least two new pieces of content, it's a great update for Lethal Company fans to get back into it. Here are the full Lethal Company Version 64 Patch Notes, for the update titled The Bag Patch:\n\n\n\nNew Tactical Belt Bag - The tactical belt bag can now be bought from the terminal. It holds 15 non-scrap items and can be accessed by other players while it's around your waist. Use \"INFO\" to learn more about it.\n\n\nRare Weather Event - A new, rare 0.6% chance weather event can now occur on any day at a random time.\n\n\nBug Fixes - A few bug fixes.\n\n\n\nWhile Zeekerss didn't go into detail about the bug fixes, it's typically changes that overall improve the quality of the game by fixing the rare bug or issue that may occur when playing Lethal Company.

          "description": "Winged Keys are one of the common currencies in Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions that you can earn in several ways and they help you unlock different characters, wands, broom trails, and more.\n\n\nUnlike the Firebolt, you need these Winged Keys to unlock certain iconic characters from Harry Potter movies such as Draco Malfoy and Cedric Diggory. They cost a certain amount and earning this currency is not as easy as earning Gold and Moonstones.\n\n\nFortunately, there are a handful of ways to earn Winged Keys, and here's how you can do that.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nHow to earn Winged Keys Quidditch Champions\n\n\nThere are two ways of earning Winged Keys:\n\n\n\nComplete Daily and Weekly Challenges\n\n\nReach different milestones in Seasonal events\n\n\n\nCompleting Daily challenges such as playing five PvP matches, winning a game, completing assists, or more can fetch you 2 to 3 Winged Keys. Weekly challenges on the other hand take longer to complete and reward you with 7 to 10 Winged Keys.\n\n\nThe current Season has several milestones and reaching at least level 50 will get you 100 Winged Keys in total. You can continue leveling up; each level beyond 50 will give you 10 of this currency.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nHow to use Winged Keys in Quidditch Champions\n\n\nOnce you have enough Winged Keys stacked up, you can head to The Vault under Market to spend them on characters such as Draco Malfoy, Cedric Diggory, Ginny Weasley, and Cho Chang. They are known as the Heroes of Hogwarts and each of their bundles cost 250x Winged Keys.\n\n\nThese characters have their dedicated bundles in the store which also offer other items such as styled wands, house-wise goal celebrations, and colored broom trails.\n\n\nWinged Keys are the enchanted Flying Keys you've read in Harry Potter: Philosopher's Stone. Just like the series, Winged Keys are equally rare to get in Quidditch Champions, and have many uses we've mentioned above.\n\nThe post How to get Winged Keys in Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Carrier AI Fragment is an interactive component in No Man’s Sky, which is primarily used to detect crashed Sentinel Interceptors in the game. Players can find Carrier AI Fragment in No Man’s Sky through a variety of ways.\n\n\nHowever, the method which guarantees Carrier AI Fragment is go after the Sentinel Capital Ships, and destroy them. A Sentinel Capital Ship is the last sentinel force sent against the player when they’re fighting sentinels in space. A Sentinel Capital Ship arrives at a level 5 wanted level. This freighter comes with regular Sentinel Interceptors to defeat the player.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have to damage the hull of the freighter and destroy it, which will also cause nearby Sentinel Interceptors to retreat. You will receive the Carrier AI Fragment among other items as loot for defeating the Sentinel Capital Ship.\n\n\nThere are also other ways in No Man’s Sky where you might stumble upon a Carrier AI Fragment, but the chances are slim. Nexus missions can sometimes offer Carrier AI Fragment as reward for completing a task. You might also receive Carrier AI Fragment as loot from successful combat frigate expeditions.\n\n\nVideo via Hello Games\n\n\nRegardless, the chances for both of these scenarios are slim, so if you are specifically looking for Carrier AI Fragment, your guaranteed way of obtaining it is by defeating the Sentinel Capital Ship.\n\n\nDefeating Sentinel Interceptors, then the Sentinel Capital Ship is not as easy task to accomplish, so make sure your starship is equipped with enough shields and weapons technology upgrades to aid you well in battle. It’s best to equip a starship with maneuverability and upgrade it with technology and weapons, as large inventory ships move and turn way slower than sleek, combat ships.\n\nThe post No Man’s Sky: How to get Carrier AI Fragment appeared first on Destructoid.",
