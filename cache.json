          "description": "Machine obsolete.\nIn a situation that echoes the reveal and subsequent Switch launch of Ori and the Blind Forest from Microsoft, we admit to feeling a tad shocked at the revelation that Sony’s LEGO Horizon Adventures would not just be released on PS5 and Windows, but also Nintendo’s humble hybrid. Sure, this isn’t the full-fat Horizon experience – PlayStation and PC owners keep that to themselves for the time being – but it’s comfortably the closest we’ve come to Sony migrating its first-party lineup over to another major console platform.\nThe result is a mixed bag. Lego Horizon Adventures starts as an incredibly fun, visually arresting dive into Guerrilla Games' flagship franchise; one that benefits from a more playful tone compared to the series proper, with faithful elements that will please fans of Aloy and Lego alike. But it’s also quite a shallow, repetitive game that leans heavily on a rather basic structure, with dull level design and severely limited stealth elements putting a dampener on the experience.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "The wait is finally over.\nA few years ago, Square Enix announced it would be doing a remake of Dragon Quest III in its popular HD-2D engine, but this was then followed by a lengthy period of radio silence where its development status seemed uncertain. While they were at it, the developers decided to go ahead and remake the first and second Dragon Quests, too. Now that Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake is finally here, we’re happy to report that the wait has been well worth it. Though it isn’t without drawbacks, this is easily the most feature-rich and enjoyable version of Dragon Quest III available.\nReleased in Japan in 1988, Dragon Quest III hails from a much simpler era, so the narrative is considerably less detailed than one you may find in a title from subsequent decades. You begin as a nameless warrior, the child of a once-legendary hero, now called upon to take up your father’s mantle and save the world from the threat of an evil dark lord. There’s not much character development to speak of, nor narrative depth—your character is essentially a blank slate and your party members are basically animated cardboard cutouts with some stats and gear attached. Though there are ultimately some clever tie-ins to other releases in the series and some new cutscenes to flesh out your father’s role, the plot amounts to little more than 'there’s a bad dude out there; go get him!'\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "A stupid inside joke I had with a housemate once was asking each other if we were \"born in Chornobyl?\" as a play on \"were you born in a barn?\" whenever either of us left the lights on before leaving the flat. This doesn’t make too much sense now I think about it, but such things rarely do. A more accurate jab, in hindsight, might have been \"you been running S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl at full specs or something?\", because based on the upcoming FPS’s new system requirements, you’re going to need a reasonably laissez-faire attitude to literally any other concern in your life that doesn’t involve acquiring a notably juice-guzzling rig.\nRead more",

Which may explain why they cancelled a game last month and laid off some of their workers.

Young’uns these days just don’t appreciate how revolutionary it was to be able to hit a cop with a thing after he’d already fallen over. Suffice it to say I’ve got good memories of the open world series’ nascent forays into 3D, though never enough to tempt me into revisiting them, especially given the poor reception to Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition. I can sympathise. I’m annoyed just having to type a colon and a dash in the same game name.\nIf you’re in a similarly non-fussed position (I will never not be annoyed that ‘nonplussed’ doesn’t mean what it sounds like it should mean) I can’t imagine a lighting update that’s been available on the mobile versions for a while is enough to tempt you back. But what is a reporter's job if not pathetically treading water between chunklets of Grand Theft Auto news, upon the publishing of which Graham presses the button to release the nutritious pellets on which we all wholly subsist? I hope he doesn’t read that last sentence. I don’t get my pellet if the syntax becomes too convoluted. Moving swiftly on.\nRead more",

Created by a trio of developers including Hidden Folks designer Adriaan de Jongh, it's a world of spacey, sun-carved mountains, forests and monoliths. The towers resemble the sacred architecture of Monument Valley, and the colour scheme and general ambience remind me of Cocoon. There's a demo, if you fancy it.\n Read more",

There has never been a better time than right this second – averaged out, and despite repeated attempts to the contrary, humanity has never been healthier, freer, or more enlightened by knowledge. It’s true of games too. For every by-committee platter of passionless map markers, there are thousands of more personal, more creative, more interesting works, all adding to the decades' worth of great stuff we can still play today.\nWhat isn’t bollocks is the emotional pull that nostalgia, for all its lack of cold, hard reason, still manages to wield inside our warm, squishy brains. Hence, the centrepiece of Apex Legends’ Season 23 update is a mode that recreates the battle royale FPS as it was back in 2019, defaulting back to the original map and weapon arsenal while cutting the 26-strong legend roster to the earliest ten. It’s a Fortnite-style rolling back of the clock, and a passably enjoyable one, but also a reminder that the good old days weren’t always that good.\nRead more",

Everything revolves around catching, selling, and collecting the fish that gather in the rivers of a small island. It also lets you customise your character with clothing. Mostly simple hats and shorts, but some options let players celebrate their sexuality, such as a rainbow-adorned t-shirts, or titles that hang above your character which simply say \"Trans\" or \"Bi\". All this led one player to complain there was no \"Straight\" title. So, the developer added one. It costs 10 grand.\r\n\r\n \nRead more",

All this, plus various daft psychological war gambits of my own devising. When overtaking or being overtaken, I used to seal my lips shut on that side and breath through the other corner of my mouth, to make it look like I was hardly out of breath at all.\r\n \nRead more",

Pages are graded along criteria such as ‘style’, ‘tone’, and ‘content’, then “fed into the algorithm” as references until “near-identical stories” to Wake’s can be produced.\n“If Jules could simply cut the painter open and pull the painting out of him, he would,” reads one of the real Alan’s typewritten pages. That’s Jules Marmont, the obsessive head of the titular FBC centre. The Marmonts - Jules and his wife Diana - are running experiments to forcibly and synthetically create works of art, aiming to mimic creative passion convincingly enough for the paranatural entity inside Cauldron Lake to respond, as it has in the past.\nRead more",

Or for posting that flukey knife throw in Call Of Duty to Twitter, as if you really meant to kill the man from across the map all along.

What’s interesting about this one is that vlog mainstay director Rich Alridge has brought along some new faces: battle designer Josh King and audio director Chris Goldsmith. And, yes, so no-one can accuse me of burying the lede: that audio design involved the enthusiastic, deeply disgusting slurping of porridge and yoghurt, and the jangling of real bones.

          "description": "I've spent quite a lot of today trying to figure out why, exactly, some of the monsters in the Monster Hunter Wilds beta looked like bundles of copulating pyramids slathered in crocodile gravy. Nic clued me in on this reddit thread earlier, which cites unnamed Chinese players who've allegedly data-mined the beta's monster models, and learned that they are extremely large, encompassing hundreds of thousands of polygons.\nIf every monster in Monster Hunter Wilds were that fancy all of the time, your computer would become a volcano. As such, the game resorts to loading-on-demand systems to ensure that you only see those gorgeous details when the monsters are close by and, as the case may be, angrily sitting on you. When they're further afield, the flourishes fall away to free up memory and processing power. The popular Redditor explanation for the presence of monsters that look like Henry Moore sculpture is basically that the LOD systems are being forgetful, and neglecting to load the additional polygons at proximity.\n  \nRead more",

This latest campaign in Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 reminds me more of the forgettable Netflix shootfests that thumbnail their way across your TV screen as you try to find some gritty nothing to aid you in zoning out of life. Still, there is an anecdotal contingent of casual sofa sitters for whom Call Of Duty is the game. A balls-to-the-wall shooter to return to every winter and rinse through in a weekend. Ed has already gestured at its multiplayer, announcing: \"yup, it's COD\", like a deeply tired Captain Birdseye inspecting the day's catch, wondering when his life will change. But never mind that. How does the single player story mode hold up? Some are calling it the best campaign in years. And I guess that's true, in the sense that it is the least worst.\nRead more",

As with the streaming giant's existing labels for M-rated material, sexual themes or depictions of gambling, the idea is that viewers can filter out such streams in advance by altering their settings.\nAdvertisers, similarly, can \"make better choices about the content they want to advertise next to\" - in other words, pull their ads from a whole swathe of material if they don't want to be associated with anything controversial. Twitch's hope is that \"the labels will allow advertisers to have more context to inform which types of streams they show their ads alongside, which we expect to increase brands’ confidence in running ads on Twitch, and could bring new advertisers to our service.\"\n  \nRead more",

Not only would this be inaccurate, but it would also do a disservice to what Straftat truly is, namely a wild overcorrection in response to the direction of modern multiplayer gunfests, one that careens straight through retro stations to arrive somewhere new and exciting.\nRead more",

          "description": "The mystery surrounding Deadlock, Valve’s work-in-progress MOBA shooter, has largely evaporated. Its freely extendable invite system is about as effective at controlling player headcount as a disinterested football steward, meaning pretty much anyone with a clued-in Steam friend can get in and start poking around its secrets. And yet, being a lane-pushing wizard fighter in the Dota 2 vein, it’s already a vast tangle of interplaying abilities, items, strats, and often unspoken rules, of the kind that even experienced gankists will take hundreds of hours to learn. It’s been too much for poor Brendy, at any rate.\nStill, Brendy is but one man. What if we had but four men, working in tandem to crush lanes and flatten Patrons just as Gabe intended? To find out if Deadlock is indeed more comprehensible as a team sport, Graham, Ed, Ollie, and James joined forces, promptly getting fucked up yet emerging from the warlock hospital with a deeper understanding of its workings. Or, at least, if anyone would keep playing.\nRead more",

Bugs and maddening enemy spawns diminished the tension of being a fleshy human scavenger in a mech battlefield. But one feature annoyed some players much more - fresh water. See, you need to keep your headquarters stocked with water, as it gets steadily used by your settlement's inhabitants. The catch being that this water diminishes even while you're not playing the game. If it runs out completely, then everything you've collected gets wiped. The developers have listened to complaints about this most Farmville of mechanics, and they've answered in an interesting way. Water thieves! Now, on top of the usual downward trickle, burglars will come to steal your H2O as well.\nIt's not as bad as it sounds.\nRead more",

And within that first hour, Slitterhead's body-possessing and Hong Kong-inspired streets had me thinking, \"Is this it, the sleeper hit of 2024?!\"\nNo, sadly not. It's no doubt built a compelling universe filled with brain-sucking aliens that masquerade as humans, and it attempts plenty else besides: bouncing between bodies as you stealth around dingy apartment blocks, fighting with blood katanas, and gorging on pools of red plasma to refuel skills, many of which require more body-flitting. Thing is, they are ultimately just attempts, attempts that fall victim to an emptiness and jitteriness that quickly reveals Slitterhead's true, irritating form.\nRead more",

It's a holographic Animus simulation, conjured from ancestral memories flash-frozen within your DNA - convenient, inasmuch as it means that any inconsistencies are your DNA's fault, not Ubisoft's. If the ledge-mantling animations are glitchy, that's simply because you have bad genes.\nWe can both be forgiven for losing sight of Assassin's Creed's modern day narrative frame. Ubisoft themselves have downplayed it since the era of Desmond Miles, the watery Peter Parker figure who served as puppetmaster protagonist for AC games up to Assassin's Creed 3. In Assassin's Creed Shadows, however, they're planning to bring back the modern day setting in a big way, though details are scanty.\n Read more",

They are ridiculous. Incredibly intricate and detailed, as well as being obscenely impractical for the most part.

It all rides on who you speak to. The humans believe one thing about the origins and workings of Thedas, the elves another, the qunari something else entirely. These differences are the basis for many factional disagreements and thus, many core series plot developments. According to former lead writer David Gaider, however, there's an \"uber-plot\" behind it all that may one day be resolved and bring the series to a close, assuming BioWare continue to refer to his original (and closely guarded) narrative documents.\r\n \nRead more",

While AMD Ryzen CPUs for a while now have been defaulting to the modern AMD P-State driver that makes use of ACPI CPPC platform support for allowing better power efficiency, AMD EPYC CPUs have kept to using the generic ACPI CPUFreq frequency scaling driver. But now AMD engineers have deemed amd_pstate ready for use with EPYC 9005 \"Turin\" CPUs and will be the default choice moving forward.

Now, after a long wait, the developers have introduced a dedicated v2 league in the game, but issues led to its temporary deactivation. \n\n\nThis article will tell you everything you need to know about why the 2v2 League in Clash Royale was temporarily deactivated.\n\n\nAll possible reasons for 2v2 League temporarily deactivation in Clash Royale\n\n\nGame crash\n\n\nThe biggest reason for the deactivation of the 2v2 League for a short period of time is due to the game crashes that are occurring when you invite your friends to play together. The fact that players can’t invite their friends for 2v2 matches has caused a lot of frustration in the community. People are really upset about it and are hoping the developers will fix the issue soon.\n\n\nZero gold\n\n\nWhen you win a match in the 2v2 League, you don’t earn any gold, which is one of the main reasons the developers decided to temporarily disable the mode.\n\n\nBut here’s something you need to know: it is just a visual error, and you receive the desired amount of gold you get by winning the match. It is expected that the developer will provide the fix very soon.\n\n\nNo season tokens\n\n\nBasically, when you win three matches in 2v2 League, you are supposed to get 800 season tokens, which is unfortunately replaced by Wooden Chests in the chest cycle. So, if you have claimed the Wooden Chests already, it is expected that the developers will provide you with a way to get the season tokens. \n\nThe post Clash Royale 2v2 League temporarily deactivated: All possible reasons appeared first on Destructoid.",

No exact release date was given, but the switch from Cataclysm Classic to Mists of Pandaria Classic will happen in 2025.\n\n\n\n\nAlthough this natural progression into Mists of Pandaria Classic was expected, I still can't help to be excited. I didn't play much of Cataclysm Classic because if I'm being quite honest, I'm not too fond of the expansion. Mists of Pandaria however is responsible to some of my favorite memories in World of Warcraft outside of Vanilla and maybe Wrath of the Lich King.\n\n\nThe expansion ups the level cap to 90 and adds the new Pandaren race and Monk class. The Pandaren are rather unique as the player can choose to join either the Horde or the Alliance at the end of the starter zone questline for the race. Mists of Pandariaalso added Challenge Modes for dungeons as well as the Pet Battle system.\n\n\nWorld of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria Classic will begin in 2025.\n\n\n\nThe post Surprise, surprise, World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria Classic coming after Cataclysm Classic appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The Centurions: TOTW Play objective is now live in EA FC 25, and it's a great way to get some amazing packs to improve your Ultimate Team squad.\n\n\nThe latest objective is pretty simple in terms of the tasks and their conditions. You can complete them easily by playing the game and get fodder packs in return. The key is to get the group rewards, as it's the most valuable pack among all the available ones. Let's take a look at how you can easily complete the challenge. \n\n\nEA FC 25 Centurions: TOTW Play objective guide\n\n\nThe latest objective set has five different tasks. \n\n\nTask\nHow to complete\n\n\n\n\n\nTOTW Takedown\nDefeat the featured Team of the Week Squad Battles squad.\n78+ x2 Rare Gold Players Pack\n\n\nTOTW Goal Streak\nScore 20 goals using TOTW players in any Ultimate Team game mode.\n78+ x3 Rare Gold Players Pack\n\n\nAssist of the Week\nAssist 20 goals using TOTW players in any Ultimate Team game mode.\n78+ x5 Rare Gold Players Pack\n\n\nTOTW Tag Team\nPlay 15 matches while having at least 2 TOTW players in your starting squad.\n80+ x3 Rare Gold Players Pack\n\n\nTOTW Victory Tour\nWin 12 matches while having at least 2 TOTW players in your starting squad.\n81+ x3 Rare Gold Players Pack\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe biggest advantage of this objective set is the fact that you can complete it across any game mode. Hence, it's not necessary to play the Rivals game mode to complete the tasks. Instead, friendlies and Squad Battles will also count towards completion. \n\n\nOnce you've completed the full set, you'll unlock a 84+ x2 Rare Gold Players pack for your efforts. It's pretty decent, and you could end up with a promo/walkout item with some luck. Hence, make sure to complete the set till it expires after two weeks from writing. \n\nThe post All EA FC 25 Centurions: TOTW Play objective rewards and tasks appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Blizzard revealed today that Warcraft 3 Reforged, the updated and remastered version of the classic RTS, is getting a big 2.0 update addressing some of the problems players have had with the Reforged version since launch. Alongside further visual updates to textures, lighting, and effects, Warcraft 3 Reforged 2.0 also comes with a much-needed revamped ranked ladder system and in-game hot key customization. Warcraft 3 Reforged 2.0 is live now and available to those who already purchased Reforged.\n\n\n\n\nThe highly anticipated Warcraft 3 Reforged launched back in January 2020 but immediately had a rocky start with washed unit graphics that blended in with the background, major performance issues including frequent crashes, barely any actual upgrades or changes, and features that were promised in the Reforged edition missing entirely. Blizzard began issue refunds to those who requested one, and Warcraft 3 Reforged went pretty silent.\n\n\nThe upgrades with 2.0 are definitely a step in the right direction, and a deserved one. Warcraft 3 is still one of the best RTS of all time, so seeing it get some extra love and care is a good thing.\n\n\nThe Warcraft Battlechest includes Warcraft 1: Remastered, Warcraft 2: Remastered, Warcraft 3: Reforged 2.0, and the original versions of Warcraft: Orcs and Humans and Warcraft 2: Tides of Darkness. It also includes some cosmetic DLC across many Blizzard games including Warcraft 3: Reforged multiplayer hero skins and a World of Warcraft Meat Wagon mount. It will run you $39.99 and is out now on Battle.net.\n\nThe post Warcraft 3 Reforged gets another chance with 2.0 update which is live now appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "There's a lot to discover on the expansive grounds of Botany Manor, and you'll soon be able to do so on Sony's platforms. Publisher Whitethorn Games announced plans to bring Balloon Studios' puzzler to PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 on December 17, 2024. \n\n\nThere's nothing unique to the consoles to keep an eye out for with this release, but at the very least it offers another way to explore this quaint and thoughtful little gem. Check out a brief look at the PS4 and PS5 versions in the announcement video below.\n\n\n\n\nBotany Manor first opened its gates on Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC (Steam) on April 9. It's also available via Game Pass for any subscribers who want to give it a quick go as part of their membership. \n\n\nFor those who haven't done so yet, Botany Manor follows retired botanist Arabella Greene. Thanks to her storied career, she now has a large collection of rare, and in some cases forgotten, plants. It's up to you to explore the manor, dig through Arabella's notes, and find out the right way to ensure their growth and continued survival. \n\n\nBotany Manor isn't just about bringing a bunch of plants back to life. Well, that's a large part of it, but it also hinges on learning more about Arabella's experiences as a woman scientist in the 19th century. You'll be able to piece together her life and what she went through, all while gathering the clues necessary to help the manor's many plants thrive. If you love plants but have the polar opposite of a green thumb, this is your ideal escape.\n\nThe post Botany Manor makes PS4, PS5 debut on December 17 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Castle Master, the haunting conclusion to the Freescape engine saga, is now ready for public testing!\nPrepare yourself for a perilous adventure as you lower the drawbridge to enter the Castle Master’s domain. Released in 1990 by Incentive Software, Castle Master became popular for its technical innovation and challenging gameplay. The game inspired countless 3D adventure titles, and the Freescape engine itself marked a technological milestone, enabling groundbreaking object interaction and spatial puzzles.\nNotably, Castle Master was one of the first games to let you choose to play as either a prince or a princess, offering a different experience depending on your choice.\nYour mission: rescue your twin, imprisoned within the eerie depths of Castle Eternity by the evil Magister. This sprawling, foreboding castle is filled with traps, monsters, and puzzles blocking your path. Gather items, unlock doors, and solve complex riddles as you navigate the labyrinthine halls and confront the dark forces within.\nThis modern reimplementation showcases enhanced graphics using OpenGL, with initial support for the DOS and ZX Spectrum releases. If you’re eager to embark on this dark journey, a playable demo is available to test your tenacity.\nTo participate in the testing, ensure you have a daily development build. We encourage all players to submit feedback and bug reports through our issue tracker.\nWill you brave the creepy corridors of Castle Eternity and free your sibling, or will you fall victim to the Magister’s curse and join his army of enslaved spirits? The adventure awaits!\n>",

          "description": "After seven months of intense work, we are ready to announce support for a few games based on qdEngine, developed by K-D Labs.\nThe work is based on the original sources published now under GPL, although the work started a bit earlier than that. The engine supports 14 games, five of which we are announcing support for. Most of these games were released in Russian; however, there were Lithuanian, Czech, and Polish releases. The support is announced for:\nWait for it! Issue 3. Song for a Hare, (Russian: Ну, погоди! Выпуск 3. Песня для зайца, Lithuanian: Na, palauk! Zuikio dainos, Czech: Jen počkej a Píseň pro zajíce)\nMask Show (Russian: Маски-шоу)\nMarvellous Mice Adventures: Meeting Sea Rat (Russian: Три маленькие белые мышки.

День рождения морской крысы, Polish: Były Sobie Myszki Trzy: Urodzinowe Śledztwo)\nOther games do work; however, we haven’t playtested them. You may find more information on our Wiki. Also, we are looking for the Lithuanian version of Little Longnose and Polish releases of Little Mice games and Wait for it! game. If you happen to have a copy, please contact sev.\nWe continue the active development so that support for other games will follow shortly. The primary constraint is playtesting.\nTo run these games, you need the latest daily build of ScummVM. If you encounter any hiccups during your quests, please file them on our issue tracker.\n>",

          "description": "We are excited to announce that Rise of the Dragon  is now ready for public testing. This is the first of a small number of games built using the DGDS (Dynamix Game Development System) engine.\nThe Dynamix name may be familiar – bought by Sierra in 1990, the Dynamix brand continued and became well known for action and puzzle games like The Incredible Machine, A10 Tank Killer, and Red Baron.  They also made a few adventures using the custom DGDS engine.\nRise of the Dragon is set in Los Angeles in a dark version of the future, circa 2053.  You play as Blade Hunter, a private investigator and retired police officer.  After a designer drug kills the mayor's rebellious daughter, Chandra, Hunter is hired to find the people responsible for releasing the drug on the streets. What Blade ultimately finds is much more than he expected.  Rise of the Dragon combines classic point-and-click adventure style with platforming arcade sequences, giving a unique gameplay combination.\nYou’ll need the latest daily build of ScummVM and files from the DOS version of the game, which you can buy at GOG (check our wiki for the required data files).  Please file any issues you notice on our bug tracker.\n>",

          "description": "Mylně jsem se domníval, že jdu na film o problematice eutanázie. Ale místo toho Toltékové, astrální cestování, život po životě, reinkarnace a Jaroslav Dušek. Hodně podobné jako \"Tajemství a smysl života\", ale o něco méně WTF a výrazně kratší. Každopádně velmi fádní a nudné, pokud od začátku nevěříte tomu, co je vám cpáno. (Ilča 20 %)",

          "description": "Film, ve kterém většinu času není vůbec jasné, jaká je zrovna motivace které postavy na plátně (např. jestli právě dělá vtip, nebo jestli se bojí o svůj život). To je jeho největší a soustavný problém, ale má i mnoho dalších, například arabské teroristy z \"Návratu do budoucnosti\" a pointu, spočívající v tom, že veřejnoprávní média vám non-stop lžou a vy jim to štastně žerete (což je pointa pravděpodobně nezamýšlená, protože film spoluprodukoval Český rozhlas). Je velmi smutné vidět dílo, na kterém pracovali lidi, o kterých víme, že jsou schopni vyprodukovat něco zajímavého, a výsledek dopadl takto strašlivě. (Ilča 10 %)",
