          "description": "Dwarven Vow #108: Let sleeping dogs lie.\nThough it’s never quite had the popularity of the Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest franchises, the Tales series has set a good reputation as the ‘other’ classic JRPG series that’s consistently maintained a decent quality for quite some time now. Back in 2004, Namco (no Bandai yet) was only on the fifth iteration of the Tales series, which made the bold transition to full 3D with the release of Tales of Symphonia on the GameCube. Sporting an attractive cel-shaded visual style and packing enough content to last for hundreds of hours, there was a lot to love about this release back when the pickings were much slimmer for great RPGs on Nintendo consoles. Now, Tales of Symphonia Remastered--which is based on the 2013 PS3 rerelease, which in turn uses the PS2 Japan-exclusive version as a base--has brought the classic experience to modern hardware and while it still remains a charming adventure, it’s definitely showing its age.\nThe story is set in the land of Sylvarant, which is experiencing a bit of an ecological crisis. A critical shortage of mana caused by the lingering effects of a war from thousands of years back means that the world is itself dying, and time is running out fast for the inhabitants. The only hope is for the Regeneration to take place, in which a person dubbed “The Chosen” opens various seals across the land to awaken the goddess and return life to all things. You take the role of Lloyd, good friend of the current Chosen, Colette. Lloyd is the headstrong son of a dwarven smith, and after he inadvertently causes a terrible tragedy in his village, Lloyd sets out with his best friend Genis to accompany and protect their friend Colette on her journey to fulfill her Chosen duties and save the world from destruction.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "\"Honey, where's my super suit?\".\nMetroid's protagonist, Samus Aran, has a rather unique privilege in the world of Nintendo. Unlike characters like Mario, Link, and Kirby, all of whom retain the same general look across their respective franchises (okay, Link is a little more varied than the other two, but still), Samus' basic design can be altered quite drastically from game to game.\nGranted, the character needs to remain relatively recognisable for fans, so you can't go nuts with this kind of thing, but when you examine Samus's overall suit design in each of the mainline Metroid games, it's surprisingly different in a lot of ways.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The trope goes all the way back to the likes of Peter Rabbit, in which our intrepid titular hero enlists the assistance of Squirrel Nutkin to help fend off the dastardly fox, Mr. Tod. It’s a concept that just works and is immediately endearing to both children and adults; so it’s no wonder, then, that Blanc resonated with so many upon its initial reveal. But does the actual gameplay hold up? Mostly, but with some important caveats.\nBlanc stars two playable characters — a wolf cub and a fawn — both of whom have been inadvertently cut off from their respective families during a sudden snowstorm. As the two try to get their bearings, they run into each other over two sides of a frozen river, and ultimately decide to help each other return to their parents and siblings. Considering there’s absolutely no dialogue in Blanc, developer Casus Ludi has done a remarkable job in communicating exactly what’s going on with the two main characters in question, despite the admittedly simplistic plot.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

But that’s the fate of deep-space astronaut Selene in Returnal, when she ditches her single-seater vessel on a remote rock called Atropos. Each time she falls foul of the local fauna, she pops back into existence right next to her broken ship, with no obvious means of escape. Forget Aliens vs Predator, this is Aliens vs Groundhog Day.\nBut what a day it is, as Returnal combines a best-in-class third-person shooter with a deep dive into the psychology of its protagonist. Selene’s journey into Atropos, through a thick jungle, a burning vermilion desert and beyond, sends her circling through a smorgasbord of emotions – from confusion to hope, despair to determination. And so often, her mood dovetails with your own highs and lows of elation and frustration, until every part of Returnal encases you in its loop.\nRead more",

It was one of that era's City Building series that included Zeus and all of the Caesars, a run of games so good that they earned the capital letters. Pharaoh also happens to be one of my foundational video games, and I played it when I was knee-high to my big brother's desk, at a time when family homes had one (1) yellow-grey computer with a CRT screen. And now it's back, baby.\nPharaoh: A New Era means I can play that game of my childhood on my shiny black RGB-lit bastard. Honestly though, the \"A New Era\" part is a bit much. Sure, the updated graphics are fabulous and the quality of life changes mean it plays like smooth peanut butter to the 90s' extra crunchy. It's a good remake of a solid game, but the mummy in the casket is fundamentally the same.\nRead more",

These drives are hard to go back to after you're used to SSDs, with their near-instant access times, completely silent operation, resistance to shocks, drops and magnets and of course their overall SPEED. \nSo when I had the chance, I bought the biggest SSD I could afford, a 4TB model at the time, and copied literally every bit of data from the four or five 1TB or smaller hard drives that I'd bought over the years and stuck into my increasingly full PC tower. It was expensive, and it took ages to copy everything across, but as soon as I turned my computer on for the first time and I didn't have to listen to the clicks and whirs of a mechanical drive, I was completely convinced I'd made the right call to ditch spinning rust.  \nRead more",

          "description": "I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: if there’s a cute animal game that looks like it’s going to make me cry, then sign me up, I’m ready to go. In fairness, though, co-op adventure Blanc looks like it's going to be a lot lighter than games like Endling: Extinction is Forever and the notoriously upsetting Shelter series at first glance, but I’ve learned to never let my guard down around these kinds of games. Those cute art styles are almost always a front for a brutal sneak attack on your emotions.\nBlanc is very much aiming for your heartstrings with its adorable animal duo and picturesque snowy landscapes. The first half teases massive potential for a cutesy story with fun puzzle antics, but the game is majorly let down by a repetitive and often frustrating second half and lacklustre ending. After the promise of a warm, cosy adventure, I watched the end credits roll and couldn't help feeling like I'd been left out in the cold.\nRead more",

You're part of a small coven with your three friends, and you all meet online every night to chat about school, shitty part-time jobs, and of course, witchcraft. At the end of each evening, you can privately ask one of your friends to hang out the next day 1 on 1, getting to know them better and just doing cool witch shit.\nRead more",

And I'm guessing it wants players to experience the joys of shredding goons, and a story told through unpredictable cuts to karaoke and anime. I'm sad to report that it isn't any of these things. Aside from the tiniest glimpses of cool when a combo comes together, the game clearly doesn't know what it wants to be, or if it did once upon a time, its original vision must've gotten lost under a dogpile of ideas. I rooted for it when I first saw it way back when, and got excited when I heard it was being made by devs behind Ninja Gaiden and Dead or Alive, but what's arrived is a jumbled mess that fights you at every turn. If I were Debra Meadon playing it for the first time live on Dragon's Den, and someone sidled up behind me and pressed a katana to my throat, I would still carefully put the controller down and say, \"It's a no from me\".\nRead more",

And, since an Ordinary (non-magical person) suddenly getting magic is also deemed weird in Ikenfell, it stands to reason that it’s practically guaranteed to happen. We can only assume the odds become even higher as the Ordinary ventures closer to the big magical fantasy school, which protagonist Maritte quickly discovers. Upon approaching the gate in search of her missing sister, Safina, Maritte suddenly starts to sling fiery spells.\nThose new spells certainly come in handy, as Maritte finds herself fired up (hehe, geddit?) and ready to fight through this Paper Mario-style tactical RPG. Along with some of Saf’s old friends, you explore the titular school and surrounding areas, searching for clues that might help unravel the mystery. Ikenfell has challenging combat and lots of little secrets hidden in its 8-bit world, but it’s the loveable bunch of pals (both allies and rivals) that really made me smile. Oh, and some of them have killer theme tunes that I can’t stop singing.\nRead more",

Where's the real magic? Where are the cataclysmic spells that take days or weeks of preparation, and then change the world with a single fateful ritual?\nThese games could learn something from The Last Spell, a roguelite turn-based tactics game about defending your village each night from hordes of mutant beasts that emerge from the purple fog surrounding the entire world. Whenever I start a new game in The Last Spell, I always rewatch the excellent opening sequence, which succinctly sets a harrowing scene of magic pushed further than we're used to seeing in most fiction in general, let alone games.\nRead more",

          "description": "Have you ever planned to do a bunch of personally improving stuff on a Sunday morning like go for a walk down to the old pier or read 30 pages of an extremely political sci-fi book about aliens made of wool, but what you do instead is sit on the sofa playing an aggressively monetised mobile game while repeats of Modern Family run on the TV? For six hours, you do this, and eat your dinner feeling sick with unrealised potential.\nMatch-3 games are compulsive for a reason, and I don't have beef with them as a concept. I actually like them! But I don't like that to play a match-3 game I usually have to play a mobile game that wants me to spent money on Fairy Dollars so I can buy barrels of Explosive Wand Dust, making it easier to earn stars and incrementally furnish the Magic Toilet Goblin's bedroom, or whatever. It's the empty consumerism vibe of freemium mobile games that makes me feel like I've been eating the time-spending equivalent of junk food. Spirit Swap, which has a demo out now in the form of an endless mode, isn't that. It's beautiful, difficult, customiseable, and it'll swallow you time in a good way, not a faintly unsettling one.\nRead more",

Most of its parts are made to a high standard, it's tragic that its final design just doesn't work at all.\nOf all things, IOT reminds me of Fragile Allegiance. You're a 'founder', sent to an already colonised and abandoned Titan to build a new city at the behest of the Council. You're a 'founder', sent to an already colonised and abandoned Titan to build a new city at the behest of the Council. First, by salvaging its ruined buildings for minerals and isotopes, then mining for surface deposits, all of which goes back into your building resources. Curiously, you never combine two resources to produce a third, you can only upgrade minerals through a tier system. Higher tier resources are more potent, meaning, for exmaple, a building site will accept 100 raw minerals or four higher tier units. It’s a bit strange, but it mostly works. Double clicking on your starting buildings summons an interior view, where you lay out machinery, little modules for workers and storage, power pylons and so on.\nRead more",

It's meaty, overhauling a few areas of the game including magic progression, spellcasting, and lair building in preparation for the endgame. But it’s also “giving you more of what you already love” with new weapons and spells, boss battles, areas, and factions. Quite a lot to sink your teeth into, then.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Start at the beginning, right? When faced with a self-imposed task as massive and daunting as writing a retrospective on The Sims franchise, going back to the very first game was the obvious launchpad. The original The Sims — now sometimes called The Sims 1 for the sake of clarity — was released in February 2000, and received regular updates via expansion packs through to October 2003. The game was the brainchild of Will Wright, the designer behind the SimCity series, who had decided to approach the world of his popular city-building franchise from a new angle. Switching from macro- to micro-management, Wright's new spin-off project aimed to focus on the architectural design of individual houses. As time went on, his creative interests would shift again, to also take in the lives of the people inside the buildings.\nRead more",

You are largely defenceless, except for the ability to draw on the ground with salt. \"In many stories that I knew as a child, salt was one of the very powerful magical protective elements against evil spirits,\" solo dev Khamelot tells me over email. \"During invocations, drawing a circle of salt could act as a basic protection.

Except when you stick three of the same building type together, they all zhuup together to create an even bigger one. And a bigger one, and a bigger one. It's very satisfying. The smooshing lights up all the same parts of my brain that Threes did when I became obsessed with it about five years ago, while the tile planning hits scratches that big Dorfromantik itch, making for an excellent Steam Next Fest demo experience.  \nRead more",

Sonic Colours: Ultimate upscaled the graphics and added a new mode when it released on console in 2021, but seemed to also add new bugs in the process. \r\n\nAs of today, Sonic Colours: Ultimate is available via Steam after a period of Epic exclusivity.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Shampoo, bubble bath and toothpaste. Salad cream, yeast and lemonade. These concoctions were the result of pure genius, a brilliant mind capable of harmonising with ingredients on a sub-atomic level to create combinations that were beyond the capabilities of any known god. My Mam was only shouting at me because she didn’t understand. These were my elixirs! Sup from this bowl and taste the future of human evolution! Yes, I know this is the same bowl we’re also sick into when we’re not feeling well, but you also bake in it so let’s not start being picky. \r\n\n\r\nAs I got older, It became apparent my future was not in alchemy. Someone who puts baby corn into a bolognese clearly doesn't posses the skill to create balanced mixtures. And yet, Potionomics has wrenched the rotting corpse of that childhood fantasy right out of its grave. Finally, here is a suitable outlet for my feats of fantastical alchemy.\r\n\n \nRead more",

My favourite thing about it, however, is that it kind of canonically confirms Lara is an ass.\nRead more",

For me, personally, it brought back memories of calling every single disaster down on my SimCity 2000 creations. However, Artificial Disasters is using the descriptor as a way of explaining the slowly disappearing terrain in Flooded. Don’t get too comfortable with your initial landmass because, over time, it will be washed away. The goal is to place your buildings carefully to escape the approaching waves.\n[embed]https://youtu.be/qCA1hjRS9bU[/embed]\nTied into this are some RTS and rogue-lite elements. There are campaign, quickplay, and endless modes to tackle. The campaign is story-driven, having you build arks to travel the expanding oceans to figure out what is causing them to rise. You’ll have to defend yourself from other survivors out to plunder your settlements because even when faced with the end, humans will always be eager to destroy lives.\nCity-builders is one of my favorite relaxation genres. However, Flooded looks like it’s aiming to add an element of stress with its constantly ticking countdown. Still, I always enjoy a bit of progress to give a nice framework to the constant people-pleasing. If I have one hang-up, it’s that I’m not crazy about the art style. However, Artificial Disasters is a solo developer effort, and it can be difficult for one person to cover every aspect of design. It’s definitely not a deal-breaker for me..\nFlooded hits PC on March 15, 2023. If you’d like to see if it’s your speed, a demo is available via Steam and GOG.\nThe post Reversed city-builder Flooded gushes into PC on March 15 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Previously, Nintendo stated that this wave would arrive in Spring, and unless you listen to ground-dwelling marmots, that isn’t until late March.\nThe first of Splatoon 3’s paid DLC will be coming in two waves. As far as I can tell, this first wave contains the Inkopolis Plaza first seen in the original Splatoon. You’ll be able to see what’s happened in the past 7 or 8 Springs, catch up with the shopkeepers, and even see the Squid Sisters perform when Splatfest rolls around.\n[embed]https://youtu.be/qpn0UPPvAb8[/embed]\nThat’s cool. That’s weird. I’ve never really thought of a lobby as paid DLC material, but maybe this is just the appetizer. There’s a second wave that will be coming along eventually, and that includes a story campaign that involves Inkopolis Square, the Splatoon 2 hub. I’m going to assume that’s where the meat of this DLC is really going to be, but Nintendo hasn’t done a super-great job of communicating that. Hopefully, we’ll finally get the ability to play as Salmonids.\nSplatoon 3 is available right now on Switch.

While Mundfish is based in Cyprus, there have been allegations that it's mainly headquartered in Moscow.\nMoreover, the studio allegedly has investors that have relations with Russian state-owned energy corporation Gazprom. While nothing has been directly proven, a lot of allegations have been brought up, and Mundfish hasn’t exactly stepped in to set the record straight itself, stating that it simply does “not comment on politics.”\nWhile Mick Gordon has not specifically commented on these accusations, this move is at least one that may help offset some of the concerns. However, it’s not the same as if Mundfish itself donated proceeds to aid Ukraine. I would encourage you to do your own research into Mundfish’s connection with the war in Ukraine, reach your own conclusions, and decide for yourself if purchasing Atomic Heart is reasonably moral for you.\nMick Gordon has scored titles such as Wolfenstein: The New Order, Killer Instinct, and Doom Eternal. Atomic Heart is available February 21 for PC, PlayStation, and Xbox platforms.\nThe post Atomic Heart composer Mick Gordon to donate fees to Red Cross for Ukraine appeared first on Destructoid.",

The Deep End Games and 2124 Publishing has announced that Romancelvania, their unholy cross-breed of Metroidvania and dating sim, will be hitting the bedsheets March 7, 2023.\nRomancelvania introduces us to a Dracula whose confidence is still laid up after a savage beating at the hands of the Van Helsing clan. Their lover left them, their minions don’t respect them, and evil just doesn’t have the same appeal anymore. Death gets fed up with this pity party and sets Dracula up with their own dating show. It’s time to choose from 12 “lucky” singles and help the dark lord (or lady) get their mojo back. Peer pressure is the proven way to turn a spark into a flame.\n[embed]https://youtu.be/-iJkv94HlBA[/embed]\nGameplay is a clever combination of gated exploration and choice-driven dialogue. You’re given the option to choose a body type, and the dating options cover whatever it is you’re into, whether you’re more a Medusa or werewolf kind of person. The whole affair is fully voiced, which is an appreciated bit of extra effort.\nIt feels like simultaneously forever and not that long ago that I played the demo and came away impressed but skeptical. The whole concept seems like it will be extremely difficult to get right, given the amount of player agency available and the two disparate genres that are trying to be married. However, nothing about the demo implied that The Deep End Games is in over the depth, so provided the rest of the game matches the bar set by the earlier peek we got, then we’re in for a real treat.\nRomancelvania is out on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on March 7.\nThe post Romancelvania brings the vampire smooching March 7 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Those who haven’t been keeping up can sample the finished version by&nbsp;downloading a free demo today.</p>\n\n<p>Darkest Dungeon II arrives on PC on May 8. The game first entered early access in 2021 and, like the original, tasks players with taking a dozen&nbsp;heroes through dangerous dungeons. This time though, you’re guiding them on a treacherous caravan ride through five dangerous regions.</p>\n\n<p>Heroes can bond with or sour on each other via the Affinity System to create combat synergies or dysfunctions. Darkest Dungeon II also boasts a plethora of new upgrades and boons to bolster party members. The demo gives players access to the four starting heroes and two&nbsp;full regions to explore, but progress will not transfer to the full game.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>You can play Darkest Dungeon II on Steam and the Epic Game Store.

Yes, there are the usual bug fixes, but this time we are also adding a feature that helps playing the SCUMM games in a truly original fashion: Support for the original loading and saving dialogs within the GUI!\nSpeaking of truly original: Remember those old CRT displays we had back in the day? With ScummVM 2.7.0 you’ll be able to replicate this experience on certain platforms thanks to our new shader-based scalers. Go ahead and give it a try!\nAll testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.\nA detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.\nThank you very much for your support! Let’s make ScummVM 2.7.0 a great release - together!\n>",

          "description": "Breaking news: OpenTTD 13.0 is now available! Depending on your perspective, we’re either two months early for our usual April 1st release, or a bit tardy for the Christmas 2022 release we intended. We think the wait has been worth it. This is one of the largest releases we’ve done in several years, with numerous features and improvements covering the user interface, gameplay features, and modding extensions for NewGRF and Game Script creators. Some of the highlights are: Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. This includes better automatic scaling when using HiDPI or mixed DPI setups. Direct access to NewGRF/AI/GS settings from the new game window. Various small tweaks and improvements to several windows. NewGRFs can now provide engine variants that are shown hierarchically in the purchase list. Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. Custom league tables for GameScripts. More natural rivers which get wider as they flow downstream. And much more, which can be seen in the changelog or the previous release announcements! In addition to these features and improvements, we’ve fixed lots of bugs. (If you played with the RC2 testing release, most were fixed before then. See the changelog for full details.)
