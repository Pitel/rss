Well, we are pleased to say that Bob Wulff's experiment over on his YouTube channel, Wulff Den, has continued, with the console now racking up an astonishing 7,000 hours of continuous screen time.\nDemonstrating the effects of such a display marathon in a new YouTube Short, Wulff has shown us that while the burn-in from his last update remains in place, the console is far from giving up yet. In fact, the pixel shadow has been such a small issue that it is only visible on very light or very dark screens.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The first two options come with a wireless charging dock, and all three versions will be available in white or black.

          "description": "\"Push and pull is the very core of game essence\".\nMasahiro Sakurai has posted his latest video on the process of creating games, this time focusing on the concept of \"risk and reward\" and how this forms part of a game's \"core essence\". Needless to say, if you're someone who's interested in game development, it sounds like a pretty crucial concept to add to your knowledge toolbox.\nUsing Space Invaders and Super Mario Bros. as examples in explaining the idea, Sakurai breaks down how balancing risk with reward is key in creating interesting and engaging games. With Space Invaders, for example, he discusses how it's important to recognise your enemy's attack range and position your laser cannon in accordance with this to achieve your own goal. The idea is to intercept your enemy rather than persue, as this will allow you to aim your own shot whilst avoiding any incoming laser beams.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

But, if we were betting people, we'd say that it sounds like this Pokémon is a little bit fond of graffiti and that it's potentially an aye-aye — not Ai Ai from Super Monkey Ball, but a type of lemur.

          "description": "Yar she blows.\nThe most recent in a line of Atari ‘Recharged’ re-imaginings, succeeding the likes of Gravitar and Breakout, Yars: Recharged sets about updating what was once the best-selling game on the Atari 2600. Originally released in 1982 and designed by Howard Scott Warshaw (also responsible for Atari’s infamous E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial), Yars: Recharged maintains the concept of wearing down the defences of a fortified boss, making a through-path and destroying it with a cannon. Unlike the static screen arrangement of the Atari 2600 title, Recharged increases the scope of the gameplay by introducing the ability to roam freely around the screen in 360 degrees.\nA twin-stick shooter, you direct your craft with the left stick while firing multi-directionally with the right. Each stage features a boss protected by geometric arrangements of hexagonal, honeycomb shield that must be blasted away to leave it vulnerable to attack. Gun turret emplacements are now hedged within the shield, firing at you with bullets and lasers. As you chip away at the honeycomb exterior and detonate a turret, glowing orbs are released, that, if collected, build a cannon meter situated at the back of the screen. When the meter maxes out you can dock with the cannon to move it vertically in line with your target, and fire massive, high-powered blasts down the line. This doesn’t just do heavy damage to the shield, but will destroy bosses in two strikes if landed correctly.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

We are, of course, being slightly sarcastic here. With well over 50 games starring Nintendo's favourite plumber as well as spin-offs such as Mario Kart and Super Smash Bros., the thought of pinning all the events together into a comprehensive timeline is enough to make even the most avid fan's head spin.\nThis challenge, however, has not prevented one Reddit user from theorising where the series might chronologically end. Rather than attempting to establish how the events of each game impacted those that came after, user Money_Whisperer has laid down the idea that the Luigi's Mansion series is the franchise's endpoint.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

In the first Splatfest for Splatoon 3, Team Rock snatched victory, but for some, winning wasn't the goal — simply trying out the new modes and the online was enough. Some even wanted to know what the server tick rates were like!\nSplatoon dataminer OatmealDome has shared their findings of the demo's tick rate (thanks, My Nintendo News!). Tick rate is measured in hertz and records how many times per second information is updated. And — for the demo version, at least — Splatoon 3's comes in a 16Hz.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The Samsung Odyssey Ark, for the unfamiliar, is a kind of all-in-one entertainment screen: a mammoth 55in Mini LED panel that can act as a desktop gaming monitor or living room TV, complete with honking great speakers and built-in support for all the big game streaming services so you can play on it without a PC or console. Unlike other monitors of this magnitude, it can also rotate into portrait mode, leaving the top curve towering over you like an unsympathetic Victorian headmaster. \r\n\n\r\nI actually enjoy a touch of design madness creeping into the occasional piece of PC gear, regardless of whether it can hang with the best gaming monitors that sensible people might buy.

Both Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier and Giant Bomb’s Jeff Grubb say they’ve been told by people familiar with the game that Mirage is accurate.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I'm a fundamentally un-grand person; I spend most days dressed like a 14-year-old fan of Tony Hawk, I do not like olives or scallops, and I'm unable to predict the consequences of actions if they exist outside of, say, a 12 month timeframe. A game like Victoria 3, where the whole point is making decisions that have country-wide effects and outcomes years in the future, is essentially operating in a different language to any I understand.\nI'm trying to learn new languages, though, so it's not an unwelcome challenge. The problem is that previewing Victoria 3 is quite an advanced level to dive in, the Paradox GSG equivalent of being a live translator for a UN summit when you're only just about able to read the French version of The Famous Five. In a presentation before I and others were let loose on the better part of a week with the game, it was claimed that Victoria 3 is the best yet for onboarding newcomers, with a deep and detailed tutorial system. And to that I say: kinda. Luckily, the AI in Victoria 3 is so advanced it's better at playing the game than I am.\nRead more",

Bouncing between appointments in this sea of booths and lanyards was jarring, but I'd eventually settle in after a few minutes of reconfiguring my brain to whatever presentation or control scheme was placed in front of me. Hyenas never gave me a chance.\nI sat in a 20-minute presentation of the game and tried my level best to understand SEGA's stab at a live-service FPS. Instead, I exited the booth with whiplash... and a sense of curiosity. Somewhere inside the game's insufferable tone is a kernel of cleverness, I just need to get my mitts on it to confirm my suspicions. Otherwise, it's very difficult to really understand whether it can survive in such a saturated space.\nRead more",

This latest rumination on voyeurism also delves into storytelling, sex, death, religion, love, lust, lies, pretence (as distinct from acting), power and self. That's a lot to pack into the partial, out of order clips of three different films, which manage to span both decades and careers. The central figure is Marissa Marcel, an almost-star actor who made three movies before disappearing. So the question you strive to answer, by looking through unedited takes and rehearsal footage, is: what happened to Marissa Marcel?\nIn typical Barlow fashion, the entirety of the footage isn't easily spooled through. From one starting clip you're able to watch it, flick back and forth through the recording, and pause it to use the in-game search tool to focus on a face or object on screen. Selecting it will then take you to that face or a similar object in a different clip, and eventually you build up a much fuller catalogue of footage.\nNow. Immortality also talks quite a bit about sex, in various ways and for various reasons, and there is female nudity. So yes, you can enhance! Zoom! on a tit. And the game will take you to another clip featuring a similar tit. Ba-dum, tsh!\nRead more",

          "description": "It's been a hot minute since I last crossed paths with JRPG series Wild Arms and Shadow Hearts, but today the key creators behind both of these late 90s and early 00s RPGs have announced they're making two brand-new JRPGs that are inspired by their previous works - and they're launching a 'double Kickstarter' campaign to help fund them. The games are called Penny Blood and Armed Fantasia (no points for guessing who's making what), and based on what I've seen so far, I'm intrigued. \nRead more",

It launched at £125 for a 1TB size earlier this year, but now it's down to £84 where it's rather more fetching. The 2TB size has also been reduced and is even better value at £152. Here's why we rate these SSDs - and where to find them at the lowest price.\nLet's do the 'where to find them' bit first. It's quite simple: WD's UK store is offering the 1TB at the best price right now, while Ebuyer is the place to go if you'd prefer the larger 2TB model. \nRead more",

Tuesday's Opening Night Live showcase featured a huge amount of trailers to gawk at, a baggage carousel of content that moved at a blistering clip. Despite its two hour runtime a lot of interesting (and in most cases, new) titles weren't given a huge amount space to breathe, their moment in the spotlight frequently cut short by another trailer waiting impatiently in the wings.\r\n\n\r\nYou'd be forgiven, then, for missing a few bits and pieces because you were blinking really fast or distracted by the cat eating something unknown underneath your coffee table. Not to worry though, as I've once again gathered team RPS to tell me in detail about the games that caught their attention during Geoffcom 2022.\r\n\n\r\nMuch like our E3 roundup from earlier in the summer, each RPS staffer took ten minutes out of their day to wax lyrical about an upcoming project featured within the showcase. All eight (including yours truly, who thanks to Katharine actually remembered to contribute this time around) chose completely different games. Some picks are more obvious, whereas others are a little off piste. In a good way, of course!\r\n \nRead more",

Since then, development changed hands like a baton at the Olympic relay; Yager left a year later, to be replaced by Sumo Digital, only for Sumo Digital to leave and be replaced by Dambuster Studios. Usain Bolt hasn't expressed interest yet, but there's time.\nSo going into a 20-minute hands-on with the game in the year 2022, I was a bit apprehensive. What sort of Frankenstinian horror awaited me behind closed doors? But, far from a shambling mess, what I played was a zombie 'em up that seemed close to what Graham saw in 2014, only polished up to a surprising, bloody gloss.\nRead more",

          "description": "Not that all the other wars were just a bit of goofing around, but World War One – a conflict remembered more for its bleak, arduous trench warfare than any great triumph over evil – seems like a particularly unusual source of inspiration for a strategy game that will, presumably, be played for fun. Nonetheless, The Great War: Western Front, a combination of macro planning and tactical RTS battling revealed this week at Gamescom, has elected to lean right into WW1’s complexities and difficulties rather than dance around them.\n\r\nDevelopers Petroglyph have gone for historical accuracy in various ways, senior designer Chris Becker and audio director Frank Klepacki explain to me at a hands-off demo in Cologne. The soundtrack will even include licensed music from the era. But something they want to really hammer home is the brutality of the war: territory won’t be won in heroic pushes but slowly and bloodily, while collapsing morale is as much a danger as any advancing army.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It’s a game clearly designed to mimic the picture book imagination of childhood with its hand-drawn visuals and the innocent silent presence of its protagonist, a young boy named OU and his opossum friend. Even its music is reminiscent of some lost, unknown childhood as we’re lulled into the strange world of U-Chronia with the smooth instrumentation of a single guitar and its occasional percussion. Yet it’s clear with the presence of beasts that threaten your safety and a shadowy clone that this isn’t some peaceful retreat into childhood.\nRead more",

Not Age Of Empires II this time, though. \nBecause there's no Matthew, I change the Cavern Of Lies into a cavern of moral judgement for Nate, and make him run a gauntlet of some of the most important choices in Dragon Age Inquisition with no context.

          "description": "\"The thing we're doing with The Dark Pictures is exploring different sub genres of horror,\" explains game director Tom Heaton. The Dark Pictures Anthology is, well, a horror anthology, each a compact standalone scary game where you explore and deal with QTEs and hazardous choices, in the vein of Supermassive's smash hit Until Dawn. The idea, says Heaton, is that each one takes one or two horror sub-genres and mines them, maybe subverting the tropes here and there. Up next is The Devil In Me, inspired by the infamous Chicago serial killer H. H. Holmes. \n\"What I think we decided with The Dark Pictures games early on was that the next game in the series would be very different from the last game, because we want to keep it fresh, we want to give the audience new,\" Heaton explains. So, after a zombie ghost ship in Man Of Medan, the psychological witch hauntings in Little Hope, and military squad vs. vampire aliens in House Of Ashes, Heaton pitches The Devil In Me as kind of Saw meets The Shining. It's a serial killer slasher in a weirdo hotel, and it has a true crime element. And I have to say, it's probably the most excited I've been for a Dark Pictures entry.\nRead more",

Happily though, there are also now a range of much more affordable keyboards that still include the unusual colour schemes, high-quality components and brilliant typing experiences that make mechanical keyboards so fascinating to me. One of the best makers in this space is Akko, and today a range of their best full-size and compact keyboards are on sale at Amazon UK. \nRead more",

There are people who love doing the management bits - the bean-counting, optimising the amount of salt on fries to make people thirsty and buy more drinks, paying close attention to demographics and average spends and that sort of kidney*. Then there are people who want to design a park full of cool-ass rides and different themed zones, a true magical wonderland. Inside this Park Beyond are two wolves, in other words, and each needs a different but equally robust set of tools to wrangle.\nAfter some hands on with an early build of Park Beyond, I have a little more faith that Limbic Entertainment are going to be able to pull it off. The toolset for building a rollercoast is, in particular, impressive. It's never been so easy to make a ride that breaks both the laws of physics and the laws of health and saftey. The coasters in this game are an absolute menace. In a good way.\nRead more",

Both of you occasionally interject, sometimes prompting a decision that changes the game a little as your granddad amends things to your liking. It doesn't go to the full meta-narrative lengths of a Juarez Gunslinger with it, but it's a cute touch and keeps the framing relevant.\nRead more",

It's only by four days, though, to October 21st, which is sort of baffling. Maybe Warner Bros. are about to announce a new DC-verse TV show coming out on the Knights' original release date of the 25th? Who knows. But along with this early-release sneak attack is a new trailer, giving us a closer look at the rogues gallery that the extended Bat-family are up against.\nRead more",

          "description": "Grim Souls-like Lies Of P will be hitting PC sometime in 2023 according to a new gameplay trailer shown at Opening Night Live during this year's Gamescom. The RPG combines the story of Pinocchio with some major Bloodborne energy, as the puppet searches for a way to become a real human boy in a decimated city. This is far from the classic fairytale story though. With a dark-gothic backdrop and mechanical killer robots to contend with, Pinocchio has his work cut out for him.

Of course, they also work for desktop computers too - and are much more portable and space-saving than an average actual desktop monitor. \nYou can even get OLED models now - and a coupon code on Amazon US brings one model down from Innocn from $350 to $200 when you tick the 'coupon' box on the product page.

Developers Build A Rocket Boy describe it as \"an original multi-world experience\" that \"will blend gameplay, adventure, creativity, and discovery in a space that blurs the line between reality and the digital world\".\nSo it will probably be either like Roblox or like Second Life, then? Hopefully we'll get a greater sense of which by the time it's out, which will be in 2023. The teaser trailer is a montage of stuff happening quickly in the shape of the logo.\nRead more",

Just, your best guess, or the squid'll getcha with its weird alien ink. Ready? Go!.... Okay, well congratulations to anyone who said \"a turn-based strategy game inspired by tabletop miniatures\". Unlikely as it may seem you were right, and everyone else was wrong. It's called Moonbreaker and it's hitting early access on September 29. And Brandon Sanderson is at this party, too.\nI admit it was a trick question, but look, I'm a genuinely big fan of devs doing a completely different project after a successful game. I also know a whole lotta people who love painting plastic fighters in cool colours, carefuly placing them on a tabletop, and slowly pushing them into other plastic fighters in different colours. I'm absolutely sure that Unknown Worlds will make a very good version of a digital tabletop strategy game. I must admit, though, that whenever a video game like this emerges, I sort of wonder why tabletop-thusiasts would buy it instead of more actual miniatures.\nRead more",

          "description": "(But Guilds and the Store still aways away)\nMultiVersus director and Player First Games developer Tony Hyunh — a man who has proven to be welcomingly exciteable in regards to their title — has teased a new update for the crossover-tastic platform fighter. The update will arrive on all platforms at some point within the next week.\nhttps://twitter.com/Tony_Huynh/status/1564381499469639681?s=20&t=U3RPA01w3BEJeNZlhaUHEA\nAsked by YouTuber AngryJoe when the in-game store would be open for business, Huynh responded, noting that while both the store and Guilds were currently on the docket, neither was considered a top priority for the title over aspects such as character balance, online stability, and bug stomping. It's worth remembering that, despite having entered its first season, MultiVersus is still technically in open beta, and, as such, is currently operating as a \"work-in-progress\" title.\nHyunh did note that the new update, which will roll out sometime next week, will contain \"cool things\" — though stopped short of giving details. the player base is currently expecting new modes such as Arcade and Ranked Online, as well as season one characters Rick (Rick & Morty), Black Adam (DC Comics), and Stripe (Gremlins) but, for now, it looks like we'll just have to wait and see what September brings.\nMultiVersus is currently available in open beta on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.\nThe post MultiVersus update will bring ‘cool things’ next week appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Lost in Time\nNintendo has officially announced a shutdown date for its mobile RPG Dragalia Lost — the fantasy adventure will end service on iOS and Android platforms on November 29, 2022.\nAs reported back in spring of this year, the decision was made to shut down the CyGames-produced title earlier this year, which will see Dragalia Lost close its servers after four years of relatively successful engagement. The narrative campaign came to a close back in July, with players encouraged to use these remaining months to wind up their adventures, max out characters, and spend any remaining \"Diamantium\", the title's in-game currency. No further Diamantium can be purchased as of today.\nhttps://twitter.com/DragaliaLostApp/status/1564503406550581248?s=20&t=8Q7I66AJbLN6-oUpGx_yQA\nLaunching in the fall of 2018, Dragalia Lost was a very popular title, raking in over $120 million USD within its first 15 months of operation. Over the course of 2021 and 2022, the earnings figures has dipped, though the game still remains somewhat popular among its hardened community. As we have quickly come to understand, however, if you are not making All The Money, you might as well be making No Money, and thus Nintendo and CyGames have decided to pull down the blinds.\n\"It is our sincere hope that you have enjoyed your experience with the game from the moment you started playing it,\" said Nintendo back in spring. \"We will strive to ensure that you continue to do so for as long as time allows.\"\nThe post Dragalia Lost will finally shut down service on November 29 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The most common cheat skipped to the testing range\nWhile Nintendo is fairly lax about, well, basically everything in regards to its online system, Splatoon 3 cheaters are already facing a reckoning: before the game is out.\nWhile Splatoon 3 is due out on September 9, this past weekend Nintendo ran a \"Splatfest\" event, which allowed players to download a demo, log in, choose a side (rock, paper, or scissors) and play. But according to famed Switch dataminer OatmealDome, Splatoon 3 anti-cheat was not only present during the Splatfest, but it also started issuing console bans.\nThis impacts folks who modify the game in any way, and apparently the most popular means of this during the Splatfest was a way to enter the testing range (the lobby system that lets you practice) immediately. Essentially, this allowed folks who shared the user-created patch to skip the tutorial segment and save some time. Well, in theory, at least. Once the game actually does come out, OatmealDome also has a running total of cycled events, including Salmon Run variants, as well as regular and anarchy battle maps.\nAs far as the Splatfest itself goes, I had fun up until halftime (as team scissors). Once the 4v2v2 mode started up things got a little dicey, especially for the winning team. As the current winner you're locked out of manually queuing 4v2v2 matches, and you can \"randomly play one\" through chance by starting up the regular Splatfest queue. It was too chaotic for my tastes, and as-is, I'll probably be playing up until halftime for these events before taking a break.\nThat said, everything else with Splatoon 3 is looking good so far: and that's before we've seen the campaign, Salmon Run, and the new card game.\nThe post Splatoon 3 is already banning Splatfest cheaters, which is a good sign appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "11.5 million rolled their eyes at Everywhere\nLast week saw the return of Europe's largest gaming industry event, Gamescom, which arrived in both a physical and online capacity for the first time in several years. And, according to live stream host Geoff Keighley, it was quite the popular event, with over 12 million viewers tuning in to day one stream Opening Night Live.\nThe stream, which took place on the evening of August 23, featured a selection of trailers, updates, and reveals on some of the hottest games headed our way in the coming year (or two). Titles such as the mysterious Soulslike Lies of P, the goofy Goat Simulator 3, brutal sci-fi horror The Callisto Protocol, and the long-in-development Dead Island 2 all found time in the spotlight, with the two most watched trailers of the entire stream being the previews for Sonic Frontiers and an update for Genshin Impact.\nhttps://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1563947341337485322?s=20&t=6NCQfoav20yFFrvFLVZC-w\nIn addition to the success of the ONL stream, Geoff notes that around 265,000 visitors from over 100 countries made the journey to the Koelnmesse complex in Germany to be part of the live show. Attendees had the opportunity to chat with developers and publishers, play demos, and catch up with some of their long, lost industry pals. It seems, on the whole, that Gamescom 2022 was a success, providing Europe's leading live event brand with some much-needed positive press.\nThe next major gaming event will be Tokyo Game Show, which will take place September 15-18 in Chiba, Japan. Of course, just like with Summer Game Fest and Gamescom, we will be sure to report all of the hottest news and reveals from the event right here on Destructoid.\nThe post Over 12 million viewers checked out Gamescom Opening Night Live appeared first on Destructoid.",

I just didn't know it yet. Little hints and bread crumbs were laying there. Percolating theories were just waiting to be blown open to something big. And I just kept tugging at the threads.\nImmortality is the latest game from Barlow and co., and it sees Barlow returning to full-motion video similar to Her Story and Telling Lies.

Much like the fishing mini-game, Knucklebones is meant to flesh out the world of Cult of the Lamb and help you pass the time when you need a break from dungeon raiding or cult raising.\nIt's good fun, the kind that sticks with you longer than it should — and fans want more.\nOne Cult of the Lamb fan created a browser version of Knucklebones, and a…",

          "description": "It's been three years already?\nIt seems like Control didn't come out all that long ago, but I learned today that it's been three years since the game's release. Man, time flies when you enter the black hole that is a global pandemic. Seems on theme for Control, I guess. It's one of the best shooter experiences to come out of games in quite a while, in my opinion, so it's only fitting that Control developer Remedy Entertainment has put together an event so that fans can celebrate the anniversary in style.\nArguably the most exciting part of the Control anniversary event is something Remedy is calling \"Fans Ask the Fadens,\" where fans will have an opportunity to submit video questions to Courtney Hope and Sean Durrie, who play Jesse and Dylan Faden in the game. The videos need to be 20 seconds or under, quality of at least 1080p, and filmed horizontally. You can submit them here before the deadline on September 1st 20:00 EEST / 18:00 BST / 13:00 ET / 10:00 PT.\n\nLast week, the studio held a photo mode and fan art contest, and they've compiled their favorites under the community tab on their website. It's not too late to get involved, though — if you have some Control art that you're just dying to share, you can head to this website to upload it. You could have your art featured on their website or socials in the future!\nOf course, they're also having a 25% off sale on all Control merch on the Remedy Store, so you can snag some cool shirts, posters, tote bags, or journals if you've been in the market for 'em. However, that sale does end today (Aug. 29) so make sure to get on it if you're interested.\nUsually a game is released and that's about it, so it's cool to see Remedy keeping the community alive. They made a great game that has a bunch of fans, and giving us all a place to come together and celebrate one of our favorite games is something I wish other studios would take on as well.\nThe post Remedy celebrates three years of Control with a fan event appeared first on Destructoid.",

Like its source material, Twisted Metal promises outrageous comic-book characterization and hi-octane vehicular carnage.\nhttps://twitter.com/beardymcwhisker/status/1563627366106255360?s=20&t=sQuHh4Oqn995BA9sbFXItg\nAlongside Marvel superstar Mackie (Falcon and the Winter Solider), Twisted Metal will also feature a posse of recognizable and very talented faces including Will Arnett (Arrested Development), Neve Campbell (Scream), Thomas Haden Church (Spider-Man 3), and Stephanie Beatriz (Brooklyn Nine-Nine). The iconic role of the mass-murdering, ice-cream-loving clown Sweet Tooth falls to Nuufolau Joel Seona, better known to wrestling fans as the bone-breaking Samoa Joe.\nAs noted previously by VGC, it is believed that the new PlayStation Productions series will precede a brand new Twisted Metal video game, yet to receive its official reveal from Sony Interactive Entertainment. Twisted Metal is the second PlayStation Productions project, following its highly anticipated adaptation of Naughty Dog's The Last of Us, will which air on HBO in early 2023.

          "description": "Just keep punching, Apollo...\nNexon and Arc System Works have released the first \"major\" balance update to their fun but somewhat outrageous fighter DNF Duel — and, to the surprise of both nobody and everybody, it seems that the utter mayhem that is the colorful anime fighter is set to continue, with little in the way of sensible action.\nVersion 106 brings with it only a handful of changes, mostly targeting the very powerful wind mage Swift Master — arguably the most troublesome fighter in a roster filled with troublesome fighters. Also feeling the sting, albeit mildly are the dashing and deadly Hitman, the hard-punching Striker, and the up-close-and-personal Grappler (who honestly needed buffs, not nerfs).\nAnd... erm... that's pretty much it. The rebalance features a slew of changes for Swift Master, and one-to-three changes for three other characters. The DNF Duel community has reacted to the balance update with both a little confusion and a little apathy — clearly expecting far more in the way of character rebalance efforts in the hyper-aggressive fighter. But nope. That's your lot for this round, it seems.\nWhile this might be something of a controversial statement, I \"get it.\" Nexon wants DNF Duel to be an oppressive fighter, it wants players to perform devastating combos with relative ease, and it wants its class-based roster to feel incendiary at worst and overpowered at best. This is, in essence, the distinct identity of DNF Duel, and while it can sometimes make for a frustrating experience online, it is ultimately the chaotic path that the title chooses to walk. Personally, I'm fine with it. And I got destroyed on stream. But I do think that maybe ArcSys could stand to put the roster under the microscope a little more.\nDNF Duel is available now on PlayStation and PC platforms.\nThe post DNF Duel gets first major balance patch… and chaos looks set to continue appeared first on Destructoid.",

Making a grand return to Germany's Koelnmesse complex, the first physical Gamescom in over two years saw players, press, and publishers gather together to show off and/or experience some of the top titles currently working their way toward an eager gaming public.\nWhile some, this author included, found the Opening Night Live stream a tad underwhelming, there was a large selection of interesting games and projects showcased both online and on the show floor over the course of the week-long event. As is tradition, a jury of Gamescom's peers and employees has put together an awards list, shining the spotlight on a selection of titles showcased during the event that stood out to the panel as being particularly promising, impressive releases.\nNow, of course, we don't need to put too much weight on this list. It is, after all, an honors list of Gamescom games as decided by Gamescom. But it's still interesting to see which of the 100+ games in attendance this week have been selected as featuring some special promise, and it may help them find their way onto your own personal radar. I'm certainly looking forward to seeing more of Lies of P.\nHere are the Gamescom 2022 award winners:\nBest Action Adventure Game: Lies of P\nBest Action Game: Metal: Hellsinger\nPaper Trail\nInkulinati\nWarhammer 40,000: Darktide\nSea of Thieves\nLies of P\nAEW: Fight Forever\nIXION\nInkulinati\nThe Last Case of Benedict Fox\nTin Hearts\nMetal: Hellsinger\n Lies of P\nHogwarts Legacy\nBandai Namco Entertainment\nPlaion\nThe game industry’s solidarity with Ukraine\nGamescom Goes Green Award: Ukie\nThe post Here are the winners of this year’s Gamescom 2022 awards appeared first on Destructoid.",

Well, you need to actually go to a Pokemon Center in Japan to snag a serial code. The distribution event is \"nationwide,\" and will run from September 3 through September 11, close of business Sunday. To get the bonus you'll need to \"do something\" with the Pokemon Center staff, which will probably amount to a passcode of sorts, announced publicly. You can find details of prior events like that here.\nCuriously, Clefairy appears in tons of games, so The Pokemon Company took the opportunity to spread the event to multiple titles. There will be three serial codes listed on the event card, which grants you Clefairy bonuses for Brilliant Diamond/Sword generations/remakes, as well as a separate third code for Legends. According to the event page, the Clefairy for BDSP/Sword/Shield will be the same, while Legends will sport a different moveset.\nYou'll be able to access the Pokemon Clefairy distribution event with:\nPokemon Brilliant Diamond\nPokemon Shining Pearl\nPokemon Sword\nPokemon Shield\nPokemon Legends\nIf you're in Japan currently and want to check it out, you can find all of the info here. Once you do get it, the serial code will expire on September 30, 2022 at 23:59 JST, so make sure you actually use it! Also I can't imagine this coming up, but it's a thing: \"If you enter the serial code incorrectly 10 times, you will be temporarily unable to enter it. Please try again after 6 hours have passed.\"\nThe post Japan Pokemon Centers running a Clefairy distribution for multiple games appeared first on Destructoid.",

TangoTeds even jokes in the mod description: \"That's it. You can go now. There's surely other mods you'd want instead, right?\"\nNope! I think I'm in the right place — and with 12,000 views in just over a day, I think a bunch of other folks are too. That includes the below Twitter video from Devil Artemis Animation, who shows off the mod in action. The way Kermit's ragdoll felt physics interact with the game feels natural, like it was a legit April Fool's skin added by Sony.\nAs I've said many times in the past, skin unlocks (especially official ones that go above and beyond with new animations and sound effects) are my jam. It was one of my favorite aspects of playing action games back in the day before DLC took over, to be able to naturally unlock something as a result of clearing a specific difficulty. PC modding has always made things easier on that front, and with the proliferation of social media and visibility, that aspect of gaming is still alive, at least, on a wider scale.\nSpider-Man Kermit mod footage:\nhttps://twitter.com/DevilArtemisX/status/1563905620390166528\nThe post This Kermit the Frog mod for Spider-Man PC fits so well appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Spinnin' them Smurfs bangers\nPublisher Microids, perhaps best known for its love of classic gaming franchises and media IPs, has announced that it is launching its own music label, Microids Records. The new in-house venture will focus on releasing soundtracks from the French publisher's litany of PC and console games.\n\"Microids Records and the new Entertainment Division are testaments of Microids’ willingness to develop the company’s brands and contents wider than the video game medium,\" said Microids' VP of entertainment, Frédéric Claquin. \"Being able to launch this label with two original scores signed by Inon Zur is a blessing and a true honour, especially as we celebrate the Syberia series' 20th anniversary.\"\nAs noted in the above statement, the first two releases from the label will be Inon Zur's dramatic scores to adventure titles Syberia 2 (2004) and Syberia 3 (2017). Going forward, fans can expect further releases from the new label, which has been formed as part of Microids' ongoing desire to increase its merchandising output beyond the realm of the physical video games themselves.\n\"This music label launch is a major milestone for Microids” adds company CEO Stéphane Longeard. \"We have always had at heart to offer music scores enhancing the games we are creating and paying tribute to our great IPS, collaborating with renown artists like Inon Zur for instance. We are fully aware about the importance of a great musical atmosphere for players, and we cannot wait to share what will be released next under the Microids Records label!\"\nMicroids' next release, Asterix & Obelix XXXL: The Ram From Hibernia, will launch on October 13.\nThe post Microids is starting up its own in-house record label appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's still a great 3D platformer with a slick sense of speed, an interesting world to explore, and yes, some nods to Nintendo's creature-chucking strategy series.\nIf you're someone who enjoys hunting down collectibles, it's a must-play. If you're more on the fence, and run the risk of feeling overwhelmed with too many trinkets to find, I can still recommend Tinykin. It's never unreasonable, and there's little if any downtime.\nThe indie game scene has been killing it with shorter yet still satisfying experiences, and this one's a fantastic distillation, albeit with a few elements I wish went further.\n\nTinykin (Nintendo Switch, PC, PS4, PS5 [r…",

          "description": "Playing with the Boys\nSomething a little more low-key from the retro fun-fans over at Hamster this week, as the labyrinthine Arcade Archives has been bolstered with the arrival of Video System's hard-spikin' Super Volleyball on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.\nReleased to the arcade market in 1989, before receiving home ports on the Sega Mega Drive and the TurboGrafx-16, Super Volleyball is an incredibly typical take on the high-jumping beach sport. Two teams of four players battle it out on a very basic 2D plane, with each team representing one of eight global nations.\nWhile Super Volleyball features neat animation and some neat picture-in-picture cutscenes, it has a generally clunky vibe and seems dated, even by 1989 standards. The same year would see other sports titles such as Midway's Arch Rivals, Technos' WWF Superstars, and Sega's Super Monaco GP. By comparison, Video System's release feels several years out of time and is admittedly a tough recommend in 2022.\nYou can check out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber Victory-Class Star Destroyer. Super Volleyball is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LckZxkh6D4\nThe post Super Volleyball gets its spike on in the Arcade Archives appeared first on Destructoid.",

A new cinematic trailer shown during Gamescom reveals a November release date, and it runs down the wacky cast of characters and why you'll be riddling them with bullets. \nThe largely CG trailer sprinkles in a bit of in-game action, though you should check out this previous gameplay video for a better taste of the over-the-top combat. We’re introduced to Grave’s allies who band together to take on a fearsome foursome of antagonists looking to rule the world (probably). Fans of the PS2 games and the anime that spawned from them will be happy to know that G.O.R.E. looks as bombastic and absurd as they'd expect. Newcomers that enjoy bullets, blood, and insanity will likely feel right at home. \n\n\nGungrave G.O.R.E. launches November 22 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

It’s worth a read if you consider yourself a diehard fan (check it out here), but the most exciting news from the conversation is the confirmation that the next game in the series is in development.\nHřebíček writes: \n“A few years away” is a long time to wait, especially since the last mainline entry, Mafia III, is approaching six years old, launching in October 2016. But we're happy to see the series continue and are curious to see where it heads next. In 2020, Hanger 13 released enhanced remasters of all three games, the most substantial being a complete remake of the original dubbed Mafia: Definitive Edition. \nWhat do you want to see in a new Mafia game?

          "description": "Netflix has reportedly canceled its Resident Evil series after just one season. \nThis news comes from a report from Deadline, which reports that Netflix has decided not to move forward with a second season of the show following the release of Season 1 last month. As far as why, there’s no official reason as of yet but considering Netflix’s past, it’s likely that Resident Evil didn’t meet expectations in terms of both critical and audience response. The show will now join many other shows canceled after just one season at the streamer including Cowboy Bebop, The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance, and more.\nDeadline notes that Resident Evil’s release came right after the highly anticipated Season 4 of Stranger Things, which might have led to its less-than-stellar first weekend on the service. However, the series still debuted in the number two spot, behind Stranger Things, pulling in 72.7 million watch hours. Deadline reports that viewers watched Resident Evil for 73.3 million hours in its second week, taking the number three spot on Netflix, before dropping out of Netflix’s Top 10 by week three. \nThis isn’t Netflix’s first foray into the world of Resident Evil, though. Its 2021 movie, Resident Evil Infinite Darkness, holds that title, but that anime series wasn’t well-received either. For more about the series, check out this retrospective video that looks back at 25 years of Resident Evil. \n[Source: Deadline]\nDid you watch Resident Evil on Netflix? What did you think of it?

          "description": "Drinkbox Studios’ Nobody Saves The World is getting a shot in the arm via a new expansion arriving next month. Dubbed Frozen Heath, this update adds new forms, challenges, and a fresh region to explore.\nFrozen Hearth takes place in an underground region that hosts The Tempering, a series of trials consisting of combat challenges and puzzles. Overcoming this contest rewards two new forms: the Killer Bee and the Mechanic, which can be used in the main game. \n\n\nOn September 13 you can buy the Frozen Hearth expansion separately for $4.99 or pick up it alongside the main game in a bundle for $27.99.  \nNobody Saved the World launched in January and became one of our early favorites of 2022. Former editor John Carson scored the game an 8.25 out of 10, writing in his review that, \n“Despite its minor shortcomings, Nobody Saves the World kept me enthralled from start to finish as I leveled my way through form ranks for the next body or ability to work with. It's most fun when unleashing devious yet approachable combat scenarios, keeping me on my toes to find the best solution to survive. Thankfully, it gave me plenty of those unrelenting loops throughout, justifying the time to save this funny little world.”",

Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. \nMetal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. \nWatch on Twitch!\nJoin me, Marcus Stewart, along with Andrew Reiner and Blake Hester, as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure.

Microsoft then declared later that day that it will not be doing the same with the Xbox Series X/S. Now, Nintendo has chimed in on the matter. \nIn a statement to Eurogamer, Nintendo reiterates a quote from president Shuntaro Furukawa, made in June, in which he stated the company has \"no plans to increase the trade price of its hardware.” Furukawa made this statement during the 82nd Annual General Meeting Shareholders that month, in which he also said: \n\"While we cannot comment on pricing strategies, we currently do not have any plans to change the price of our hardware due to inflation or increased procurement costs in each country. We will determine our future pricing strategies through careful and continued deliberations.”\nAlthough the PlayStation 5's price will remain unchanged in the U.S. (for now), both versions of the console have become more expensive in Canada, Europe, the UK, Mexico, Japan, and Australia. The price hikes have already gone into effect in those regions except Japan, which occurs on September 15. \nThe only time Nintendo significantly adjusted the price of its current consoles was last fall, when it permanently reduced the cost of the standard Switch model in the UK and Europe. Nintendo has yet to do the same in the U.S. \n[Source: Eurogamer]",

Over three minutes of gameplay footage shows off the carnage you'll unleash against adversaries, both artificial and organic. \nPlayers wield melee weapons or firearms in one hand and more, shall we say, unconventional abilities in the other. That includes electrifying targets with lightning bolts, tossing them around with a telekinesis-like power, freezing foes solid with an ice blast, or using wires to hijack machines. The action-packed video shows off how players can creatively combine their arsenal to dismantle and disembowel anything standing in their way. \n\n\nAtomic Heart was first announced in 2018 and takes place in an alternative futuristic version of the Soviet Union in 1955. Robotic technology flourished post World War 2, allowing humanity to create a high-tech utopia. Unfortunately, these mechanical helpers have started rebelling against their human creators. If that wasn’t enough, killer mutants born from secret experiments have also run amok. Players control private agent P-3, who embarks on a secret mission to get to the bottom of what’s caused this seemingly perfect society to collapse and clean up this mess. \nAtomic Heart launches this fall for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

With those credentials, it's little surprise that Wanted: Dead looks absolutely bonkers. \nThe story centers on Hong Kong cop Lt. Hannah Stone, a member of the Zombie Unit. She and her squad must get to the bottom of a corporate conspiracy, but the game doesn’t appear to be nearly as serious as its premise lets on. Gameplay blends stylish swordplay with explosive gunplay as players slice and/or shoot through gang members, mercenaries, and other foes in an adventure that looks ridiculous. The release date trailer also shows off anime cutscenes, rhythm music gameplay, cute cats, and whatever else it manages to cram in. \n\n\nWanted: Dead is launching on February 14 and is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.",

He believes that this is a good thing for the gaming industry in the long run. \n“[It] is something we’re just going to see less and less of,” when discussing the idea of specific games being exclusive to a single device. “Maybe you happen in your household to buy an Xbox, and I buy a PlayStation, and our kids want to play together, and they can’t because we bought the wrong piece of plastic to plug into our television.\n“We really love being able to bring more players in reducing friction, making people feel safe, secure when they’re playing, allowing them to play with their friends, regardless of what device – I think in the long run that is good for this industry. And maybe in the short run, there’s some people in some companies that don’t love it. But I think as we get over the hump and see where this industry can continue to grow, it proves out to be true.”\nBloomberg also asked Spencer about the status of Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard acquisition, how the company will handle unions and ongoing unionization efforts happening within Activision Blizzard, and more, so be sure to check out the publication’s full story here. \n[Source: Bloomberg]\nDo you believe Spencer’s right?

We first learned of the project during the Xbox Games Showcase in June. \nThe game's art direction emulates medieval manuscript illustrations and woodcut prints while the story unfolds in 16th-century Bavaria. You play as an illustrator who becomes wrapped up in a series of murders over 25 years. You'll engage in choice-driven conversations where your decisions steer the plot and create lasting consequences in a tale that expands into a larger conspiracy. Check out the original reveal trailer below to see it in action. \n\n\nPentiment is made by a small team within Obsidian led by director Josh Sawyer.

So, it’s only fitting that Gamescom 2022 ended with two trailers (cinematic and gameplay) for the long-overdue zombie-slaying sequel. \n\n\nWe follow a chiseled survivor named Jacob as he leaves the safety of his (bloodied) condo and ventures into a Californian hellscape swarming with undead. He kills several adversaries with an empty rifle, jutting it through their rotten bodies and smashing their heads against the pavement with its wooden butt. \nThe gameplay trailer shows scenic beaches, forsaken suburbs, cratered city streets, and still-lit carnivals. In what is one of the most graphic clips I’ve ever seen at a game show, we watch as the player-character clobbers zombies with blunt objects, jump-kicks adversaries off roofs (parkour mechanics?), and shoots gasoline tanks to engulf hordes in flames.\n\n\nDead Island 2 is a first-person action RPG with six playable characters. And according to a designer who appeared onstage, the gory romp has an irreverent, pulpy tone and gameplay that’s all about “experimenting with your preferred zombie-slaying methods.”\nDead Island 2 punches and kicks its way onto PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on February 3.",

Plenty of blood is shed as humans are used as lab rats in Murkoff Corporation's Saw-like tests. In some cases, the tests just look like torture and flatout murder.\nThe game looks overly graphic, yet also brings about comparisons to BioShock's tone and storytelling conventions. It'll be interesting to see how the narrative sews all of these wild experiements together. The Outlast Trials is designed as both a single-player and cooperative experience. The player clearly is free to explore at certain points, and appears to rely on trap-like devices to fight back and escape. In one sequence, we see two players helping each other up to higher ground.\nThe footage concludes with news of a short closed beta running from October 28 to November 1.

On top of plenty of flavor text about the dark and gritty world, we saw several gameplay shots – including, but not limited to, destroying giant steampunk monsters in a victorian theater, massive open levels, and even lighting a marionette-inspired spider on fire. A Pinnochio-inspired soulslike might be a goofy sentence to type, but you know what? The game looks really neat. Check it out below: \n\n\nLies of P doesn't yet have a release date. However, it'll be released on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC sometime next year. Better still, it's coming to Xbox's Game Pass on day one.",

This Focus Entertainment-published title debuted at Gamecom Opening Night Live, and is slated to release in 2023 for PlayStation 5 Xbox Series X/S, and PC.\nThe game is set within the sands of a timeless land, and the protagonist can unleash sand-powered abilities and infuse sand into shape-shifting weapons. The sand arsenal is used to hunt legendary monsters in either a single-player or cooperative campaign. In the cinematic trailer, we see one hero use sand to repair a bridge, and another hero glide along the sand like she's on a hoverboard. Together, the heroes create various weapons with the sand, like a whip, to down a handful of alien dogs. We'll have to wait to see how closely the gameplay mimics the cinematics.\nDeck13 Interactive is the studio behind Lords of the Fallen and The Surge series of games.",

Sonic Team was open about many parts of its upcoming open-zone adventure, but one part it has remained tight-lipped on is the Sonic Frontiers release date. Today, we not only got a new trailer for Sonic Frontiers but a release date for the game too.\nRevealed today during Gamescom Opening Night Live, we now know that Sonic Frontiers launches on November 8. The trailer shown during the livestream gave us a look at a second island in the Starfall Islands: Ares Island. In stark contrast to the first island we saw – Kronos Island – Ares Island appears to be a desolate, sandy biome.\n\n\nSega and Sonic Team also revealed the pre-order bonuses and the two editions players can choose from. The standard edition of Sonic Frontiers includes the base game (physical or digital), with a pre-order bonus of the Adventurer's Treasure Box, which includes skill points, Red Seeds of Power, and Blue Seeds of Defense. The Digital Deluxe edition includes a digital copy of the game, the Explorer's Treasure Box, which includes Amy's Memory Tokens, a Portal Gear, Chaos Emerald Vault Keys, and additional shoes and gloves for Sonic, and the Digital Art Book with a 25-track digital mini soundtrack. If you pre-order the Digital Deluxe edition, you also get the Adventurer's Treasure Box. The standard edition is listed for $60, while the Digital Deluxe edition is listed for $70.\nSonic Frontiers launches on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on November 8.

Glen Schofield, creative director of the new space horror adventure and one of the leading designers on the Dead Space franchise, made an appearance at Gamescom 2022. He thanked fans for the positive response and spoke about the gritty new gameplay trailer, “We’re gonna show combat and something new with a crazy ending.” \n\n\nProtagonist Jacob Lee pulls a health item with one of his abilities and proceeds to crouch-sneak his way through a group of prowling monsters. He downs one with a stab to the back and fires at another creature, stumbling toward him with tentacles squirming around its exposed belly. To top things off, he brawls with a regenerating creature adorned with cysts and sends it flying into a chainsaw-like structure in the environment. \nIn the next scene, Lee slides down a sewage drain while dodging deadly pillars along the dimly-lit channel. And in a shocking ending, reminiscent of the death scenes from Dead Space, the leading man hits a massive propeller obstructing the tunnel and gets ripped in half (I’ll spare you the gory details). Schofield warned the trailer’s ending would be wild, and it did not disappoint.\nThe Callisto Protocol launches for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on December 2.",

Publisher CI Games has long desired to bring a follow-up to market, but those plans haven't gone as planned, and the sequel bounced between several development studios before landing at Hexworks. During today's Opening Night Live festivities for Gamescom, we were treated to our first look at Hexworks' The Lords of the Fallen through a violent three-minute cinematic trailer that highlights the differences between the realms of the living and dead.\nSet one thousand years after the original, The Lords of the Fallen is designed with cooperative play in mind, allowing two players to experience uninterrupted online play. A press release describes the game as an \"expansive RPG experience filled with NPC quests, compelling characters, and rich narrative.\" The world is also said to be five times larger and interconnected. The focus is once again on soulslike combat, said to be faster than the precursor game with a touch of \"devastating magic.\"\nWhile we hear the voice of Stranger Things actor Joseph Quinn in the trailer, players will be creating their own identities. It's unknown if Quinn will be featured in the game or if he just narrated the trailer. The Lords of the Fallen doesn't have a release date yet, but will release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.\nThe world of soulslike games has evolved significantly since Lords of the Fallen hit the market.
