It started out on the Super Nintendo and was eventually scaled back during the Nintendo 64 era before parts of it morphed into other projects.\nWhile a Super Nintendo version is believed to have existed, it seems now we've got actual photo evidence of Dream 64, after the Rare co-founder Tim Stamper randomly uploaded a single photo on social media, with the following text attached: \"Arr....!

Bayliss then shared these sketches on Twitter, showing the progression of the design from Shigeru Miyamoto's initial drawing to some firmer ideas that were used to base the eventual 3D model on.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Which is strange, since Muv-Luv is considered by many to be one of the most greatest visual novels of all time. What begins as a light-hearted slice-of-life high school romantic comedy eventually pulls the rug out from under the player, and transforms into a war epic featuring mechs and aliens with a much darker tone. In Muv-Luv’s original Japanese release, this twist was hidden and only briefly hinted at in the marketing.\nToday both Muv-Luv games are easily available on Steam, marketed specifically with this twist, and where they sit fully-translated and with Overwhelmingly Positive reviews. iOS and Android ports are apparently in development, and other Muv-Luv spin-offs continue to get translated. But the first time anyone experienced a complete English language version of Muv-Luv was in July 2010, when a fan translation group called Amaterasu released a patch localising the first game.\nRead more",

          "description": "Look, I’m not saying Far Cry 3 is responsible for *gestures vaguely towards modern AAA games* but it’s definitely a prime suspect. If I was trying to connect a piece of red string from the middle of my evidence board (which would probably be a picture of the map screen from Assassin’s Creed Valhalla), I’m not sure I’d push a pin directly into Jason Brody’s face, but I’d definitely circle it in black Sharpie a few times. Basically, in the eleven years since its release, I’ve grown a bit suspicious of Far Cry 3’s lasting legacy. \r\n\n\r\nAnd yet, in those halcyon days of 2012, we named it our game of the year. Although it’d be easy to simply say that decision was made a bit before my time here, I should probably admit that when reviewing the game for the blog I used to run when I was at university, I awarded it an equally prestigious (stop laughing at the back) 10/10. That almost seems ludicrous, doesn’t it? Far Cry 3? Game of the year? Surely not.\r\n\n\r\nAfter spending a few hours revisiting the sunny shores of Rook Island, I was shocked to discover a game that feels surprisingly pure. Mechanically, I hasten to add. The actual act of playing Far Cry 3 in 2023 is still good fun, it’s the bits around it that are a bit ropey.\r\n \nRead more",

As you emerge onto the floating city of Columbia, the game takes you on a guided tour of the sights and sounds of this airbone civilization. As you saunter through the streets, you learn about its citizens and its creator, just sort of taking it all in. The sun is shining. You're surrounded by smiles. Before you know it, an airship rises above the clouds and perches next to a hugging couple, gently swaying in the summer breeze. Aboard the ship is a barbershop quartet, cheerfully harmonising the iconic Beach Boys tune God Only Knows. It's a memorable scene, and has become an integral part of the game's lasting iconography. \r\n\n\r\nBut for Tyler, Nick, Derek and Greg, this section was more than just a fun tease for the secret behind Columbia's unusual success. Self-confessed music school kids, the quartet inspired them to create their own musical group styled after Infinite's singing hairdressers. In 2023, BioShop Infinite celebrated their ninth year at PAX East, where they performed a wonderful collection of harmonised tunes to an absolutely packed community room - and we were there to film it.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Still, it seems a slightly odd move, because Road 96 - a first person hitchhiking choose 'em up about the collective action of wayward teens bringing down a totalitarian government - doesn't really need a prequel. On top of that, Road 96: Mile 0 is a sequel to developer DigixArt's first game Lost In Harmony, a musical runner about skateboarder Kaito whose fiend Aya is dying of a terminal illness.\nIn Mile 0, Kaito and his family have moved to a small gated town called White Sands, in the 90s USA-adjacent dictatorship Petria, and made best friends with Zoe, who 96ers will remember as a recurring NPC from that game. Zoe is the daughter of an important minister and lives in the nice part of town; Kaito's parents are workers who are forced to live on the wrong side of the tracks. Through a combination of Road 96-style character-driven vignettes and Lost In Harmony-style rhythm action tracks, the two come to the conclusion they must leave White Sands. If you played Road 96 you kind of already know how Mile 0 has to end.\nRead more",

It's a promise of all the myriad adventures to come. And despite some fundamental changes in genre and perspective, it's something that the team behind the upcoming Minecraft Legends has tried hard to preserve.\nI recently was treated to the most in-depth look so far at Minecraft Legends, in an hour-long livestream which gave us all some much needed answers on what manner of beast Legends actually is. It's a curious blend of action adventure and RTS, one that shares Minecraft's focus on exploration, but guides the player down a stricter, simpler path of summoning friendly mobs and constructing defences to repel a Piglin invasion. This will likely be a solid introduction to the RTS genre for a lot of players, but I came away unsure about whether the game will have enough depth to keep its prospective playerbase's attention.\nRead more",

Jackson wanted it for his character in the prequels). \"I was like, 'we gotta have a pink lightsaber blade',\" says production director Kasumi Shishido. \"So whenever I play I always stick with my pink saber.\"\nShishido tells me the dev team focused on improving on Jedi: Fallen Order for this sequel, and one of the bigger areas where they did that was customisation. \"We knew we wanted to put more resources and effort into it,\" she says. \"There's a lot more that you can do with Cal, with BD... and just within Cal, it's not just outfits you can customise, so I'm just really excited to see what players are going to do with it.\"\nRead more",

          "description": "When Marek Markuszewski had finished working on The Witcher 3's Blood And Wine expansion, he wanted to go back to basics and make something by himself, Starward Industries' chief marketing officer Maciej Dobrowolski tells me at GDC. Something that would capture the same kind of cultural Polish heritage as The Witcher - originally adapted from Andrzej Sapkowski's six-strong series of novels - but that would take him on a new, more introspective kind of development journey. It took a while to find, but after a fateful encounter with an investor who'd just sailed across the Atlantic with only a copy of Polish sci-fi writer Stanislaw Lem's The Invincible for company, the signs were too good to ignore, Dobrowolski says. And after spending the best part of a year convincing Stanislaw Lem's son (and current rights holder) of the same thing, Markuszewski finally had his something - and a new partner to help him realise it.  \n\"People tell us, 'Don't fuck it up, this guy's important,'\" Dobrowolski continues, and no wonder. During the course of our conversation, Lem is described as both a \"national treasure\" and \"mandatory reading in high school\" for Polish students, and his hallowed cultural status is something the team's \"had to deal with\" in bringing the book to life. Despite all this, though, Dobrowolski insists this \"isn't a one-to-one adaptation\" of Lem's interstellar rescue story gone wrong, and that fans of the book will still find some surprises on the surface of Regis III as they explore its strange canyons, caves and crash sites.\nRead more",

We interviewed the teams behind four of the eleven 2023 finalists, asking the developers behind Go-Go Town!, Paper Trail, Slay the Princess and Xenotilt: Hostile Pinball Action about their experience of bringing their games to PAX, what they learned along the way, and what it’s like to spend four days standing on your feet talking to thousands of attendees (spoilers: it’s really bloody tiring).\r\n\n \nRead more",

I agree with him, although his attention is divided by, e.g., having a child in need of stimulation, and mine is divided by, e.g., being a child in need of stimulation.\nIt's probably turning my brain into cottage cheese, but I often do things at the same time as playing a game, like listening to music or a podcast. I understand that podcast games are sort of a genre now, but I've started doing it with regular games. Is this a me problem? Sure.

Hello! I am the second imposter covering for our dear Ed, who is currently away on holiday in Japan (and I’m definitely not jealous at all). Let’s get into some good words, shall we?\nWired’s Megan Farokhmanesh interviewed Richard Hofmeier, the developer of Cart Life - a sobering game about three street vendors trying to make ends meet. Hofmeier tells the story of his decision to remove the game from Steam ten years ago and his reasons for bringing it back.\nHis time away from game spaces made him appreciate the spectrum of expertise his colleagues had in things he’d never done. It was humbling. “So many people have talent and passion that gets entirely overlooked,” he says. He loved working in games, but back when he released Cart Life he feared a career in the field could get too insular. “The most interesting art, to me, comes from outsiders,” he says. “I was a little bit scared of becoming an insider myself.”\n Read more",

I can still remember sitting at the family PC in our living room, begging my parents for more internet time because I wanted chat to my friend on MSN Messenger. We had to buy hours of internet in those days, and between my young teenage self and my three brothers, we absolutely devoured those meagre weekly limits, always pleading for more, more, more as we became absolutely captivated by this new world of the online. \nLuckily, Emmett doesn't have to contend with such antiquated restraints in Videoverse, as his portal to the internet is built right into his enormous Nintendo DS-like home console, the Kinmoku Shark. As well as using it to play games reminiscent of old 16-bit classics, there's also a Nintendo Miiverse-esque social network on the Shark that Emmett uses to chat to his friends, post fan art of his favourite game, Feudal Fantasy, and feel part of something bigger. What hasn't changed since those early internet days, however (or indeed, the internet today) are the types of people he interacts with - there are trolls, of course, but there are also plenty of nice people here to support him, and the emergence of seemingly new user (and budding fan artist) Vivi quickly becomes the main subject of Videoverse's current free demo that's available as part of Steam's Storyteller Festival.\nRead more",

I looked into it and sure enough, the current record-holder is the gap between the season one finale of Life Is Strange and the first episode of its prequel Before The Storm: 1 year, 10 months, and 12 days. That means that come mid-August of this year — specifically, the 14th, which marks the 683rd day since True Colors' Wavelengths DLC released — LIS fans will be leaving the Shire whether we like it or not.\nI suspect that Life Is Strange: Steph's Story — the first prose novel tie-in to the franchise, released on March 21st — was commissioned with fans like me in mind. Fans who work out useless trivia like the above because they need something to occupy them when there's no new game on the horizon and they've played all the existing ones to death. Fans who know every character's canonical middle name and birthday. Fans who complain that it feels like they never have time to read any more, but nevertheless finished the novel and wrote a silly supporter post about it within ten days of publication. Of course I really liked Life Is Strange: Steph's Story. But will you, as a person whose relationship with this franchise is statistically guaranteed to be more normal than mine?\nRead more",

Can Fabel finally embrace his talents, ditching the figurative shackles of his difficult past as he chases his dream of becoming a famous bard?

This led us to discover the PAX East Facebook group, a community of over 8,000 members brought together through their shared love of video games, pop culture and PAX itself. The page is dominated by a striking banner image, a photograph that shows a large group of people crowded around the PAX logo that's a permanent fixture in the main hall of the Boston convention centre.\r\n\n\r\n Rachel and I found this photograph fascinating. Who were these people? Do they take this picture every single year? How did something like this start, and who was responsible for organising it in the first place?\r\n\n \nRead more",

Sometimes two or more of these horrors intersect, and by that I mean you can romance that tentacled man in this gothic, alternative-history dating sim. Spooky suitors will need to wait a while more, though, as Mask Of The Rose has been delayed to June 8th - previously slated for April.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Wildfrost is excellent at creating moments of triumph. Early on in my playthrough while I was still getting to grips with the game, I came face-to-face with a boss who got stronger when hit. Its card art had become bigger, juicier, more tauntingly malevolent, and easily could have taken out any of my team with a single hit. Thankfully, three of my team members were due to act one turn before it. The first chipped away a little of its health (its job was mostly healing) but the next doubled a stacked debuff that I had set up and turned the goliath into a giant bomb, and the effect of my two cards combined was just enough to trigger it. BOOM! My backline leader didn't even need to lift a single finger.\nPlaying with turn order and setting up synergies is a key part of how Wildfrost plays as a roguelike deck builder. Each individual card on the stage is part of a counter system, with both delaying and advancing them on the playing field being strategic choices. Some actions are free, like moving your cards around the stage or withdrawing them for healing, but playing cards out of your hand or shuffling your deck will pass the turn.\nRead more",

          "description": "Last month I wrote about Intel's Linux kernel engineering improvements to help enhance CPU scaling across various workloads by addressing low-level bottlenecks within the kernel. It's an area we'll likely see Intel continue to invest in as Sierra Forest comes next year with 144 E cores per socket. Already with the Linux kernel patches Intel is carrying at the moment via their in-house distribution, there are some significant benefits for Xeon Scalable Sapphire Rapids. I was curious to see how this Intel-focused work impacted AMD EPYC servers and thus in today's article is a similar analysis using two AMD EPYC 9654 \"Genoa\" flagship processors while evaluating Intel's Linux kernel optimizations.",

          "description": "R-Trope\nYou might find yourself doing a double-take at this week's Arcade Archives release — And nobody could blame you for suffering something of a sense of deja vu, as Hamster reaches into the bottomless well of old-school shmups and pulls out Allumer's suspiciously familiar Rezon.\nReleased to the arcade market in 1991, Rezon is a space-themed horizontal shmup, which puts the player in the cockpit of a hi-tech vessel, blasting off in a hazardous mission to the stars. As you battle your way through waves of enemy ships, ground walkers, and snaking, pattern-based baddies, your ship can be outfitted with a variety of cool new weapons and abilities, all of which will be more than necessary to redress the balance, as Rezon is nothing if not absolutely rock solid — borderline relentless.\nCheck out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber Martinoz.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwXmOUfCpEQ&ab_channel=Martinoz\nBut let's address the elephant in the room: It's R-Type. It's shamelessly R-Type. Not in the sense that titles such as SNK's Last Resort are \"kinda R-Type\". Rezon is almost a direct clone, with carbon copy stage layouts, enemies, weapon designs, and general gameplay flow. Allumer's rip-off doesn't have the excellent bosses of Irem's 1987 hit, but it has practically everything else.\nUnsurprisingly, Rezon did not make its way to any home platform, perhaps more than aware of the questionable legal situation it might find itself in if too many eyes looked its way. Still, despite its xeroxed nature, it should be noted that Rezon provides a helluva challenge for hardened arcade fans, and is still worth a quick blast for the more dedicated of shmuppers.\nRezon is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.\nThe post Shameless R-Type knock-off Rezon jets into the Arcade Archives appeared first on Destructoid.",

The results were less than stellar. Harvest Moon: Light of Hope revisited the top-down feel of the original game with mixed results, and the less said about Harvest Moon: One World, the better.

          "description": "OF COURSE!\nFollowing on from the news earlier this week that Legendary Entertainment has acquired the film and TV rights to Street Fighter, Capcom has confirmed that a brand new movie is in the works at the Dune, Godzilla, and Jurassic World production studio.\nOf course, there is basically nothing else to go on — I'd be surprised if a script has even been rough drafted at this point — but we can likely expect the picture to be a live-action affair, and to feature a relatively violent affair involving lots of punches, kicks, and spinning piledrivers... Well, Maybe not the last one. We'll see. Whether the events of the movie will focus on classic SF adventures, encompass modern characters such as Luke and Juri, or be some wild amalgamation of the universe is, for now, all up for speculation.\nhttps://twitter.com/StreetFighter/status/1643660498150227977?s=20\nCapcom will no doubt be looking to at least match, (and hopefully surpass), the critical and financial bar raised by Warner Bros. 2021 release, Mortal Kombat. And given Hollywood's increasing lean towards \"somewhat good\" video game movies, SF fans will be hoping to see an authentic and exciting adventure that steps high above the poorly paced slog that is Street Fighter (1994) and the head-scratchingly off-brand Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li (2009)\nIn the meantime, we can all concentrate on the upcoming launch of Street Fighter 6, a title that Capcom hopes will propel the legendary fighting franchise back to the forefront of the gaming scene. And given the initial response to the character roster, the new modes, and the hugely successful beta tests, Ryu and chums are gearing up to deliver a whole new era of entertainment for the 35-year-old franchise.\nThe post Capcom confirms Street Fighter movie in the works following license sale appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Seems EVERYBODY went Bingo\nCapcom has proudly announced that its recent release, Resident Evil 4, has already smashed past four million shipments and digital sales since its initial launch on March 24, less than a fortnight ago.\n\"The Resident Evil franchise features survival horror games in which players utilize a variety of weapons and other items to escape terrifying situations,\" wrote the publisher in a press statement. \"Cumulative shipments of the games in the series now exceed 135 million units since the first title debuted in 1996. Now, more than 27 years later, continuous support from the passionate fan base across the globe makes it Capcom’s flagship game series.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id2EaldBaWw&ab_channel=ResidentEvil\nThe meticulous, ground-up remake of the 2005 GameCube classic has already seen smash success, both critically and from a sales perspective with critics and fans, offering intense action, grisly visuals, and reimagined versions of classic boss battles and iconic setpieces, all powered by a WoK3 SouNdTraCk. Three million sales of Resident Evil 4 took place within the game's first two days of release, with a further million copies shifting in the following week.\nThis is, of course, not even the end of the road for Resident Evil 4, as fans can expect the monster-mashing mode The Mercenaries arrived as a free update for all players just yesterday. In addition, rumors persist that the enjoyable, Ada Wong-driven side-mode \"Separate Ways\" is also currently in the works, to be released as DLC for the remake at a later date. The incredible success of Resident Evil 4 sets publisher Capcom up for a stellar year, with titles such as Exoprimal, Mega Man Battle Network Legacy, and Street Fighter 6 still on deck for 2023.\nResident Evil 4 is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.\nThe post Resident Evil 4 surpasses four million shipments and digital sales appeared first on Destructoid.",

This Dead Rising-esque mechanic seems fairly fluid and extends to multiple objects: not just weaponry. Of course, you can use it to forge new weapons and ammo...like the meat arrow.\nFolks have been talking about raw meat arrows ever since the aforementioned walkthrough hovered over them ever so slightly, and the community has now made that a reality in Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Popular Zelda modder Waikuteru just put out a new video detailing their meat arrow mod, which...adds meat arrows into the game.\nAlthough you can get the gist in the first few minutes of the video below, Waikuteru walks us through all of the possibilities these new toys can bring to the table.\nI'd welcome adding some of Tears of the Kingdom's mechanics back into Breath of the Wild\nAdding a rudimentary fusion element into Breath of the Wild seems simple enough: and even if it doesn't have the same fully-featured functionality as Tears of the Kingdom, you're still flinging a meat arrow at an enemy at the end of the day.

          "description": "Pizza Time\nKonami has announced that Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection has crested 1 million copies sold. That’s a lot of pizza.\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection is a compilation of 13 games made throughout Konami’s time with the license. While this mostly just means it’s the Arcade titles and well-known ports, it also includes some less-beloved titles, such as the various iterations of The Tournament Fighters. The ports were handled by Digital Eclipse, who did a great job bringing the games over and including some awesome extras.\nhttps://twitter.com/Konami/status/1644324155125559298?s=20\nPersonally, I feel The Cowabunga Collection is incredibly important. Licensed games are among the most difficult to get modern ports of, simply because the publisher often has to reacquire rights, and the costs there can mean that it’s simply not a profitable venture. I felt that the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles games were among the most unfortunate victims of this limitation, as they are some of the best licensed games developed. Having them left on platforms that are no longer supported would have been an unfortunate fate.\nThankfully, Konami has been mining its dragon’s horde of old titles recently with compilations like Castlevania Anniversary Collection. While I feel like the publisher is better known for pissing all over its history, I love being proven wrong, and their recent collections, including the Cowabunga Collection, have been heartening.\nNow that I’ve offered some praise, I must now make demands for compilations of games such as Ganbare Goemon, Parodius, and a scattershot of unlocalized Famicom titles.\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection is available on PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, PS5, and Switch.\nThe post Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection sold a million copies, dudes appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "GZDamn that looks good\nI’m glad our community is looking out, since this one nearly got past me. Retro-engine FPS Supplice has been released on Steam Early Access today.\nDesigned by modders and built on the GZDoom engine, Supplice is the latest FPS looking to take you back to the days when 3D wasn’t made of polygons and enemies queued up to be exploded.\nhttps://youtu.be/dRtT28_HBPI\nCurrently, developer Mekworx is presenting Supplice’s first episode of five missions for Early Access. They’re attempting to release a new episode every 2-3 months until completion. Supplice has technically been in development for 14 years, but began its life as a total conversion of Doom. The team got ambitious and decided it was time to spin off into a full product.\nI saw a few seconds of footage from the trailer and immediately recognized the exaggerated head bob from the Doom engine. That classic engine’s bones form the foundation of GZDoom, allowing for techniques that weren’t possible back in the day. Along with Supplice, another indie game called Selaco is utilizing the engine to create something both familiar and unique.\nI love old raycasting engines and think it’s great that developers are utilizing them again. While they’re certainly more constraining than your typical polygonal 3D engine, they have a quality that is difficult to replicate. I’m hoping to see more like it going forward, as Ken Silverman’s Build Engine has also seen some love from games like Ion Fury.\nSupplice is available on PC right now through Steam Early Access.\nThe post Supplice raycasts it way to early access on PC today appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Get shapez while you’re at it\nHey everyone, are you ready to add another game to your pile of gifts from Tim Sweeney? I know I am, and I swear I’ll find the time to play everything in my expanding library of freebies. All I need to do is discover that pocket dimension where time ceases to exist and I am gold.\nFrom now until April 14, Dying Light Enhanced Edition is available for free on the Epic Game Store. Originally released in 2015, Dying Light is occasionally considered Techland’s spiritual successor to Dead Island. Of course, given the impending release of Dead Island 2 as an Epic Games PC exclusive, the choice of Dying Light as a freebie is pretty funny. Perhaps they intend for you to see one co-op zombie game and remember there’s a new one coming in two weeks. After all, since Dying Light was originally released in 2015, fans of the genre have likely long since played it.\nThat said, let’s not bury the lede here; shapez is also free on the Epic Game Store. Though I joke a bit here, shapez is a legitimately well-loved minimalistic base building game. It typically costs $10, but even a price as low as that can’t beat free. I can’t wait to finally play this one once I figure out where to find eight additional hours per day that don’t come from sleep.\nLike Dying Light Enhanced Edition, shapez will be available for free until April 14. As usual, once you claim these games, they are yours to play even after the deadline. MORDHAU and Second Extinction are next on the freebie list, so make a reminder for next Friday if those interest you too.\nThe post Dying Light Enhanced Edition is free on the Epic Game Store appeared first on Destructoid.",

Unsurprisingly, you’ll need some reasonable meat on your PC’s bones in order to… what the hey? What the gosh darn dickens!?\nAccording to this, you’re going to need 144GB set aside for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. Why?\nTo put this into perspective, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II (the new one) wants 125GB of digital territory. The original Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (the new one) wants 175GB of space, and that’s largely because it includes Call of Duty: Warzone. Ark: Survival Evolved, with all its goodies and expansions, takes up somewhere around 400GB. Hitman 3 (the new one) tells me it wants 72.35 giga-acres of hard drive. Doom Eternal is at 89GB. Finally, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order tells me 55.92GB.\nIt’s not the biggest, but it’s also bizarrely huge for a single-player-only game that isn’t fully open-world. It’s built in the Unreal 4 Engine, and it looks snazzy, but I’m not sure I want it to desecrate 144GB of my hard drive.\nHere are the rest of the specs, as found on EA’s site:\nMinimum System Requirements\nOS: Windows 10 64-bit\nRAM: 8Gb\nCPU Features: 4 core / 8 threads\nCPU AMD: Ryzen 5 1400\nGPU AMD: Radeon RX 580\nGPU Features: DX12, 8Gb VRAM\nStorage: 155Gb\nPC Recommended System Requirements\nOS: Windows 10 64-bit\nRAM: 16Gb\nCPU Features: 4 core / 8 threads\nCPU AMD: Ryzen 5 5600X\nGPU AMD: RX 6700 XT\nGPU Features: DX12, 8Gb VRAM\nStorage: 155Gb SSD\nIt wasn’t so long ago that I just left most of my games installed because they didn’t make a dent in my expansive hard drive. Now we live in a world where having a full terabyte of vast, open space means you can install a handful of games. I guess on the other hand, my internet speed is faster, so maybe it’s just a matter of changing my habits.\nStill…\nStar Wars Jedi: Survivor PS5, Windows, and Xbox Series X|S on April 28, 2023\nThe post Star Wars Jedi: Survivor wants to sprawl itself all over your hard drive appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The darkness comes\nFulqrum Publishing has announced that a sequel to Byte Barrel’s 2022 retro-inspired shooter, Forgive Me Father, is on the way to PC. Forgive Me Father 2 is said to “build up on the satisfying action of the first game and double down on the striking pulp, comic book inspired visuals.”\nA teaser has been dropped alongside the announcement, and as with most teasers, it doesn’t really show off anything in terms of actual gameplay. Just a pair of hands reloading a revolver.\nhttps://youtu.be/fJPxUZthqn0\nAt least that small bit of gameplay has shown off what is definitely an FPS. The first game in the series was a Lovecraftian twist on the classic shooter formula. It tied in creepy eldritch weapons and a madness system that let you go nuts on enemies. The graphics also strikingly feature 2D hand-drawn images.\nIn our review of the game, Noelle Warner found the original to be rather dull and repetitive. Hopefully, for Forgive Me Father 2, Byte Barrel can address feedback and knock this one out of the park. It certainly has a visual style that makes it worth a look.\nForgive Me Father 2 is coming to PC at some point in the future.

That means it's time for more showcases, reveals, and streams, including Gamescom Opening Night Live.\nShow host Geoff Keighley confirmed the date and location today on social media, as the show will be hosted live from Koelnmesse in Cologne, Germany on August 22. No word on the time yet.\nhttps://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1643971101280681985\nAs for what to expect, well, it'll be a whole host of video game news. Gamescom Opening Night Live is usually the last big show of the summer of gaming news, sitting right near the end of August and leading right into the Gamescom event.\nWhat this means is a lot of reveals, trailers, and spotlights on upcoming games. For example, last year is where we saw Dead Island 2 get a release date (that would eventually get delayed), a leaked Sonic Frontiers date got confirmed, and Hideo Kojima announced his podcast.\nAfter the streams of summer have gone\nThe summer is going to look quite different this year, though. E3 has officially bowed out of the conversation, with the ESA and PAX organizer ReedPop calling off their plans for in-person and digital. Though we've been without a proper in-person E3 for a few years now, this news feels a bit like a nail in the coffin.\nMeanwhile, Keighley's Summer Game Fest is still cruising along. The SGF show will air live on June 8, with a live audience. Xbox and Ubisoft are also planning their own shows for the summer, too.

The Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster series will hit PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch on April 19.\nThe Pixel Remaster series is a direct remastering of the early NES and SNES-era Final Fantasy games, from the very first up to the legendary Final Fantasy VI. They will be made available individually for $17.99 a pop, or you can get the full bundle of all six for $74.99.\nThough both PlayStation and Switch are getting these Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters, there's no word on an Xbox release.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC6bH50jCik\nA big update for these versions is a new pixel font, addressing one of the major complaints from the PC version. I'll need to see them in-game to really get a sense, but it's nice to know Square's at least trying to rectify the font situation. The pixel font, it's noted, is not supported in all languages.\nAdditionally, some quality-of-life features have been added. There is the modern UI and bestiary, but also some nice updates like the option to switch between the original and new music. There are also some settings to tune encounter rate, EXP and Gil gain, and more.\nA new home for old classics\nThe Pixel Remaster series is notable, as it's the easiest way to get a hold of and play these classic RPGs. Even though the price tag feels a bit steep for me, I'm happy that there will finally be a way to play games like Final Fantasy IV on the Nintendo Switch.

There are four heroes in the base game—I would be shocked if we don’t get one or two more in an expansion pack—each with unique abilities that I can’t wait to see in action. First up for the introduction videos is Layla, the telekinetic hero who can conjur umbrellas, elevators, and her undead boyfriend Jason as she fights against the things that go bump in the night.\nThe video gives a little bit of information on Layla’s background, focusing on the night she and Jason came face to face with a couple of bloodsuckers. Using the telekinetic powers she gained during a laboratory accident, Layla's abilities make her a good candidate for anyone attempting to solo their way through Redfall. In combat, she can manifest protective umbrellas to shield her from attacks, a Lift to reach higher places, and a ghastly version of her old beau for when she's surrounded. A versatile fighter, Layla will likely be the first fighter I go with when I get around to paying the nightmare island town of Redfall a visit.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdLeBCGh1PU\nDeveloped by Arkane Austin, the same team that gave us Prey and Dishonored, Redfall will release on May 2, 2023, for Xbox Series X|S and PC, and it will be available at launch through Xbox Game Pass.

Some folks haven't done this yet (or are unable to), so perhaps this distribution will help!\nHere's the full tweet from the Play Pokemon Twitter account:\n\"Tune in for the 2023 European International Championships live stream starting April 14th for some fantastic #PokemonVG & #PokemonTCG gifts! Learn how to add Palafin to your team roster and Miraidon ex to your digital Pokémon TCG collection.\"\n\nThe accompanying news article has a bit more info on how it'll actually be distributed, and a confirmation that it's based on competitive Pokemon player Gavin Michael's Palafin:\n\"Wait for the password to appear during the 2023 EUIC broadcast, then go to the Mystery Gift feature in your game and enter the password to receive Gavin Michaels' Palafin—you can even add it to your next competitive team! This password can only be used once per save data.\"\n\nSo that's it! Wait for the code to arrive and enter it. Seems easy enough! We'll update you when that time comes. Until then, you can find all the info you need on the Palafin itself below.\nPromo Gavin Michaels Palafin info:\nPoké Ball: Cherish Ball\nGender: Female\nLevel: 50\nOriginal Trainer: Gavin\nNature: Adamant\nAbility: Zero to Hero\nTera Type: Water\nHeld Item: Mystic Water\nMoves:\nThe post Pokemon is preparing a free Palafin distribution later this month appeared first on Destructoid.",

Though no official statement's been made as of this writing, Harrison's LinkedIn does reflect the change, with his departure from Google marked at April 2023.\nHarrison has been around the games industry for quite a while, working at both Sony and Microsoft over the years. He joined Google in 2018, taking the lead on the company's efforts to start up the cloud streaming service Stadia. Harrison even took the stage at GDC 2019 to unveil this vision for a streaming future.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUih5C5rOrA\nOf course, we all remember how Stadia turned out. In 2021, Google shut down its internal development projects for Stadia, saying it would not be investing further in bringing exclusive content from its internal development team. At the time, Harrison cited the \"exponentially\" rising costs of creating \"best-in-class games from the ground up.\"\nThen, a year later, Google officially closed the curtain on Stadia. All hardware purchases made through the Google Store would be refunded, and in January of this year, the service officially shuttered. Harrison wrote in a blog post that the technology hadn't \"gained the traction with users\" that Google expected.\nThe clouds set\nThere's been no formal announcement, and no indication of what may be next for Harrison. As for Stadia, well, that's just about through.\nGoogle recently told Axios in an interview that it's been selling a bundle of services to publishers, moving into the role of tech partner for live-service publishers.\nThe post Former Stadia head Phil Harrison has reportedly left Google appeared first on Destructoid.",

The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog is a real visual novel in which you investigate the death of Sega's beloved mascot, currently free on Steam. Here's the game's description via the publisher: \nIt's Amy Rose's birthday, and she's hosting a murder mystery party on the Mirage Express! When Sonic the Hedgehog becomes the game's victim, everyone is off to get to the bottom of things. However, something feels a bit off - is this really an innocent game or is something more sinister afoot?\nSurprisingly, the free game has proved very popular. As told by Sonic social media manager Katie Chrzanowski (via GameSpot), more one million people have played the game. Going a step further, it's apparently the 61st highest-reviewed game on Steam right now, and as GameSpot points out, the best-rated Sonic game on Steam (though that's not the highest margin to clear, all things considered). As of this writing, The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog has over 11,000 user reviews on Steam, netting it an \"Overwhelmingly Positive\" ranking. You can check the game out for yourself right here. \nOver 1,000,000 of you have grabbed The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog and it's currently the #61 highest rated game on Steam of ALL TIME.\npic.twitter.com/Cy2cIo2AHl\nApril 5, 2023\nThis all just goes to show – the world wants Sonic dead.",

As of today, there's a new update for God of War Ragnarök featuring a load of new content, all built around a robust New Game Plus mode.\nNew Game Plus opens up for anyone who has beaten the game, and all of your equipment and skills will come along for the ride. You also have access to all weapons, including the Draupnir Spear. However, it should be noted that areas requiring that spear to access will still remain closed until you reach the appropriate point in the story. For similar reasons, you also won’t start your new playthrough with Sonic or Hex arrows.\nSeveral new armors show up. The most interesting is the Spartan Armor, which recalls Kratos’ look from the old days in the Greek Pantheon. While wearing it, you get no perk, no stats, and it’s locked at Power Level 1 – expect a challenge.\nNew Game Plus also features a new level cap, enchantments, and progression paths to improve your capabilities. Players can also tackle an expanded version of the Niflheim Arena, where you play as either Kratos or Atreus and bring along a variety of companions to help out.\nAmong several other additions and improvements, players can also take on a Black and White Render mode for a more cinematic playthrough.\nIt’s a notably large blast of new content that ensures that dedicated fans should have good reason to jump back in if they desire.\nGod of War Ragnarök released last November for PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4.\nYou can read the full details on the newly arriving content over at the PlayStation Blog.",

          "description": "In 1993, the Super Mario Bros. made their big-screen debut through a live-action adventure starring Bob Hoskins, John Leguizamo, and Dennis Hopper. While that film has garnered a cult following in the decades since its theatrical release, it does little to truly pay homage to Nintendo's flagship franchise in the ways all the best film adaptations aspire. Fast forward 30 years, and Universal, Illumination, and Nintendo have finally delivered a cinematic adventure starring the iconic fraternal duo that is joyful, fun, exciting, and, perhaps most importantly, respectful of the source material.\nWarning: While I try to remain as spoiler-free as possible, certain elements of the narrative and characters are mentioned throughout this article.\nThe Super Mario Bros.

          "description": "Pokémon Stadium, the classic 3D battler/minigame collection for the Nintendo 64, just got a Nintendo Switch Online release date. While the game's imminent arrival to the online service was announced at a Nintendo Direct in September 2022, today is the day we finally know when we can play it. Pokémon Stadium comes to Nintendo Switch Online Wednesday, April 12. As is the case with all N64 games, you'll need the expansion pack in order to play it. Check out the full trailer below.\n\n\nWhile some fans may have hoped this port would include trading with Pokémon Home, they're unfortunately out of luck. The fine print in the trailer specifies that \"Pokémon cannot be transferred to this game.\" That said, there is also a notable improvement: four-player online multiplayer will be available, so you can play Clefairy Says or Sushi-Go-Round with friends all over.\nNintendo Switch Online's expansion pack had a slow start, but its library has gradually snowballed into a much more significant package. In February, the service added a Game Boy Advance library, which included fan favorites like The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap and Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga. A month later, Metroid Fusion joined the lineup. Meanwhile, the base tier of NSO got an update last month that added another small handful of titles. To see all the retro games currently available on the service, check out our complete list.\nWhat's your favorite minigame in Pokémon Stadium? Let us know in the comments!",

The plot of the graphic novels/movie centers on slacker musician Scott Pilgrim battling the seven evil exes of his new girlfriend, Ramona Flowers. \n\n\nThe primary actors from the live-action film are higlighted in the trailer above, which include:\nMichael Cera - Scott Pilgrim\nMary Elizabeth Winstead - Ramona Flowers\nKieran Culkin - Wallace Wells\nSatya Bhabha - Matthew Patel\nChris Evans - Lucas Lee\nAnna Kendrick - Stacey Pilgrim\nBrie Larson - Envy Adams\nAlison Pill - Kim Pine\nAubrey Plaza - Julie Powers\nBrandon Routh - Todd Ingram\nJason Schwartzman - Gideon Graves\nJohnny Simmons - Young Neil\nMark Webber - Stephen Stills\nMae Whitman - Roxie Richter\nEllen Wong - Knives Chau\nUnfortunatley, the series currently still doesn’t have a release window other than “coming soon.” Scott Pilgrim has always had a strong relationship with video games; the graphic novels and film incorporate a bevy of gaming references. Of course, we’d be remiss, not to mention the much-beloved 2010 beat ‘em up Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game, which was remastered for modern consoles in 2021. \nAre you excited to see Scott Pilgrim return as an anime? Let us know in the comments!",

Live A Live was originally released in 1994 for the Super Famicom in Japan, but it hadn’t been localized for the West for decades. Directed by Takashi Tokita, one of the lead creative minds behind Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy IV, the game consists of eight very different short stories, each starring its own protagonist and featuring distinct gameplay mechanics and presentations. While the battle system is turn-based strategy, sometimes the game flips that on its head in unique ways.\nLast year, Square Enix resurrected the title by giving it an Octopath Traveler-style HD-2D facelift, a rearranged soundtrack, and full voice-acting. You can pre-order the game on PlayStation and Steam to get a 20% discount. To learn more, you can read our review of Live A Live here.",

Square Enix has announced a new story expansion called In Tanta We Trust, and it takes place decades before the campaign begins.\nThe story sees Frey Holland follow a mysterious voice that leads to her being sent back in time 25 years before she first stepped foot in Athia. She arrives at the Purge of Rheddig, the battle that caused Athia’s collapse and pushed the Tantas to madness. Frey must now fight to save this era of Athia, and she has backup in the form of Tanta Cinta. Frey gains new magical powers, including tag-team-focused abilities that utilize Tanta Cinta’s talents. The DLC also features new environments for players to scale using Frey’s parkour skills. \nForspoken: In Tanta We Trust is a paid expansion that launches on May 26. Those who purchased the Digital Deluxe Edition of the game can play it three days early, on May 23. For more on Forspoken, you can read our review here.

We look forward to sharing more details with our players very soon.”\nUbisoft CEO Yves Guillemot stated in February that the company would commit to attending “if E3 happens”. If that's the case, this news certainly doesn’t bode well for the fate of what’s supposed to be E3’s big return. \nAs for what Ubisoft could show at its event, Assassin’s Creed Mirage, The Crew Motorfest, and (maybe) Skull and Bones are slated to release this year. Other announced projects include the long-quiet Splinter Cell and Prince of Persia remakes, a multitude of new Assassin’s Creed games, and Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. A rumored follow-up to Immortals Fenyx Rising could also make an appearance.  \nUbisoft joins Nintendo on the list of major publishers that have declined to participate in this year’s show, following a previous report that Microsoft and Sony plan to follow suit. E3 is largely organized by ReedPop this year and will take place June 13-16 at the Los Angeles Convention Center.

          "description": "A video game based on the hit Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles graphic novel The Last Ronin is in the works, Polygon reports.\nThe news comes from Polygon's interview with Doug Rosen, senior vice president for games and emerging media at Paramount Global. According to Rosen, The Last Ronin video game will be a single-player action role-playing title in the vein of the Norse-themed God of War series. Like the story it adapts, the game will feature a mature tone. The game’s developer has not been named, and the project is years away from release. \nThe Last Ronin was published in 2020 as a five-issue mini-series by IDW. It takes place in a dark futuristic New York, where three of the four turtles have been killed. The surviving turtle, whose identity is revealed at the end of the first issue (we won’t spoil it), dons a black mask and seeks revenge by fighting crime using both his and the weapons of his fallen brothers. \nIt’s a cool (and very grim) story if you haven’t read it, and we’re excited to see it translated into a game. Rosen also mentions in the same interview that Paramount sees opportunities to create different types of TMNT games that target young and adult audiences. \nThe Turtles are enjoying quite the renaissance lately thanks to the launch of the well-received beat ‘em up Shredder’s Revenge last year, the nostalgia trip of the Cowabunga Collection, a Shredder-themed Call of Duty pack, and even a new animated film coming to theaters this August.  \n[Source: Polygon]",

Despite some shortcomings, the compilation remains the best official way to experience those classic games from Genesis and Sega CD three decades following their original releases. Today, Sega announced the bundle is about to get better through Sonic Origins Plus, a premium upgrade that arrives a year after the collection's initial launch.\nSonic Origins Plus brings forward all the features of Sonic Origins delivered last year – Classic Mode, Anniversary Mode, widescreen support, added story animations, a virtual museum, and more – while adding a bunch of new content. First up, Sonic Origins Plus adds all 12 Sonic Game Gear games to the museum.\nThe full list of Game Gear games getting added is listed below.\nDr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine\nSonic Blast\nSonic Chaos\nSonic Drift\nSonic Drift 2\nSonic Labyrinth\nSonic Spinball\nSonic the Hedgehog\nSonic the Hedgehog 2\nSonic the Hedgehog Triple Trouble\nTails Adventure\nTails' Sky Patrol\nOn top of that, Amy joins the roster of playable characters in the Genesis and Sega CD titles (Sonic 1, Sonic 2, Sonic 3 & Knuckles, and Sonic CD). One of the strangest exclusions in the original Sonic Origins release is also rectified, as Knuckles will become playable in Sonic CD. Sadly, this first press release does not make any mention of restoring the replaced music in Sonic the Hedgehog 3.\n\n\nSonic Origins Plus arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on June 23. If you don't already own the initial release of Sonic Origins, the digital version of Sonic Origins Plus costs $40. The physical version, which includes a 20-page artbook and reversible coversheet with new art, also costs $40. If you already own Sonic Origins, you can upgrade to Plus for $10.
