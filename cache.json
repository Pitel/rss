But it was very messy because it was my first game and I didn't know what the hell I was doing. So I found myself, when it came to pumping content out, I was like: oh, shit. This code base is fucking awful. Like, I can't put stuff together easily. I'm running into bugs everywhere. But now shit just works!\"\nYou might know Sam Prebble as Trigger Happy Interactive, the solo developer behind frenetic FPS Turbo Overkill. Before that he went by a different name, attached to a very different project. Total Chaos, first released in 2018 under the moniker Wadaholic, is a total conversion mod for Doom 2. With its focus on a thick survival horror atmosphere of tension and disempowerment, it's about as far removed from Turbo Overkill's manic, Doom Eternal-inspired action as a game can get. As Prebble puts it, the only thing the two projects have in common is the first person perspective. Even so, he found himself returning to Total Chaos after wrapping development on Turbo Overkill, resulting in the standalone remake. \nRead more",

          "description": "Like it or not, horror gaming is often built on jump scares. Deriding a good cheap scare ignores the endorphin rush that draws so many players to the genre, in the same way that the \"elevated horror\" trend forfeits some of the soul of schlocky slasher flicks and ghost movies. Don’t get me wrong, Silent Hill and Alan Wake deserve their flowers - but even those games would wither on the screen if Pyramid Head didn’t bust through a wall from time to time.\nOne unsung jump scare game in particular pioneered horror in the internet age, blazing everywhere from nascent social media to major television networks. In fact, if you had an internet connection circa 2005, there’s a good chance you played it. Alas, it was too ahead of its time, too successful at leveraging virality before viral horror was sought after. Next time you see a streamer throw their headphones across the room in fright, beware: the spirit of Scary Maze Game is right behind you.\nRead more",

I was bracing to send the good news to developers Skyglow Softworks that, so far, nobody has managed to copyright “space”, though I’m sure somebody’s tried. Maybe, um, God? \r\n\n\r\nIt’s a relief to know that God won’t be suing Skyglow Softworks for breach of copyright, because off the back of two demo missions, Annihilate The Spance is worryingly compelling. It’s a mixture of space RTS and autobattler, wherein you construct bases that produce spanceships who autopilot towards the nearest and largest concentration of enemies. According to the developers, it’s inspired by the 2011 Flash game Obliterate Everything by CWWallis (RIP), which I dimly recall playing while I was running a browser game blog for AOL.

The slate wiped clean, what if you got to be mates with everyone from all sides in this grand ensemble tale of warring states? A battle might take eight minutes. The three consecutive bonding cutscenes before the next might take ten. Origins is just as much about fighting thousands at a time as it is about eating lunch with Zhang Fei or discussing the meaning of heroism with Zhou Yu. There's a parallel story about your character and his role in a magical order of destiny godlings I didn't find the least bit interesting, but the rest is thrilling because Romance is already thrilling.

          "description": "One for Obra Dinn and Golden Idol fans, this, although also for anyone who just loves a gorgeous map of an alien environment. Locator is a detective puzzler where you play an interstellar cartographer tasked with tracking down a missing archeologist named Abigail Lidari on an alien world. It takes inspiration from browser geography game Geoguessr. You’ll be studying sets of photos and comparing them with notes from Abigail’s journal, then pinpointing her location on a series of lovely maps.\nRead more",

Coming soon to press that advantage are the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 9 9900X3D, a pair of even higher-spec processors that headlined AMD’s plethora of CES 2025 hardware announcements.\nNo pricing (or exact release date) on these yet, but they both up the core and thread counts over the 9800X3D while peaking at higher boost clock speeds. And, of course, they share the same 3D V-Cache design that makes the 9800X3D such a superlative CPU in the first place. If you don’t know what this is and how it helps game performance, imagine how much faster you could eat Wotsits if you had a massive bucket of them on your desk at all times, instead of having to get up and walk to the kitchen to grab individual packs. In this case the Wotsits are data, the bucket is 3D V-Cache, and the hastened ruination of your digestive system is games running faster.\nRead more",

The setup here is that you're stuck in a tabletop underworld with a bunch of elder gods, or Dread Deities. As Custodian of this dusty funereal expanse, you must place structures on tiles around your throne room, striving to fulfil the desires of whichever Dread Deity is in play, while fending off pernicious attackers from the realm of light.

Yet that's the challenge taken up yesterday by speedrunners at Awesome Games Done Quick. The UFO 50 speedrun includes an impressive dart through the retro collection's most bewildering game, the ancient and mysterious Barbuta, in which your character is a frustratingly slow hero with a fearfully short attack range. They managed to complete it in less than five minutes. Not only does the run (and its helpful commentary) serve as a short and sweet explanation of why Barbuta is so glitchily fascinating, it also left plenty of time to marathon another three games from the collection. \nRead more",

          "description": "Gentle reader, I have previously written exactly two boob-related articles in my life. One was a cheesy round-up of the best manboobs in video games for Green Man Gaming's long-vanished blog. It was published sometime in 2010, and IIRC, pre-reboot Kratos came out on top. I think/hope it still exists somewhere in the apparatus of Green Man Gaming, hidden beneath the retailer's veneer of respectability like a barrel of radioactive waste. The other boob article was a piece for OXM about Ken Levine saying that he wished people would stop fixating on Elizabeth's cleavage in Bioshock Infinite - a complaint we might consider slightly hypocritical, given the character's visual design.\nNow it's time for boob article number 3: some modder has given 122 of the 150 Jokers in cardgame Balatro big chests. This extends from visibly human Jokers to Joker concepts that shouldn't, strictly speaking, have the capacity for boobage. The banana card has boobs, for example. The credit card card has boobs.

Paradise is marketed as a third-person game set in a sunny modern city, where you can speak to any NPC via microphone on the street and get stilted responses powered by artificial intelligence. You will supposedly drive sports cars, shoot guns at people, and accrue in-game cash. But its more outlandish claims attracted immediate scrutiny from video creators who found countless inconsistencies in the marketing material. The game has since been removed from the Epic Games Store, presumably for breaking many of the store's rules. But it's still on Steam, and somehow clambering steadily up the wishlist ladder in defiance of its many red flags.\nRead more",

Look for the waterfall near a stone bridge to find it. You'll first want a companion with you, who has the Mining specialty, so the process becomes faster. Mine at the rocks that have a blue streak to them. Hit them with the pickaxe, and you have a good chance to get a Vitalys Crystal. Having a companion with you gives a chance of getting another Vitalys Crystal. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nRich Soil is gained by digging up the soil at any location, especially within the Plaza. This is a random drop. Having a digging specialty companion with you may help with the process too. \n\n\nDreamlight is gathered by completing quests and finishing Duties like taking a picture or collecting enough apples. You can check your objectives on the menu. It's under the first section \"Dreamlight.\" You can also craft Dreamlight with Dream Shards.\n\n\nHow to use this elixir\n\n\nOnce you have all of the ingredients, go to any crafting station near your house or in Scrooge's store. You can find the Miracle Growth Elixir from the list of options. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nMake sure to pick the correct potion. Once it's made, use it from your inventory menu. Then, equip the water can. Spray it on the crops you want to see grow instantly. You only have a few limited uses so pick your crops wisely. \n\nThe post How to make Miracle Growth Elixir in Disney Dreamlight Valley appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Strange Scaffold has announced that I Am Your Beast is getting one least content update. Titled Cold Sweat, it will include “New Levels. No Story. Just CHALLENGE.” It hits January 23, 2025.\n\n\nI Am Your Beast describes itself as \"he's-in-the-walls\" fantasy, and that’s a pretty effective way of describing its over-the-top power fantasy bent. It’s all about always moving while shooting, throwing, and stomping. Certain stages have different objectives, such as hacking laptops, but largely, you’re trying to just take out everyone wearing camo.\n\n\n\n\nI reviewed it back at launch, and what really struck me about it was how readable it was the whole time. Despite all the chaos, you can easily tell what’s going on at any time. Every target, every attack, and every hit is well communicated, which enables you to pull off incredible feats of agility. I had some issues with the storytelling, but the game itself is butter.\n\n\nNot much has been said about the update aside from what you need to know in general. It’s a challenging new set of levels, though from the original (now deleted) post, there doesn’t seemt o be a new narrative to connect them all, which makes it a bit different than the last one which put the new content in a neat little narrative package centered around survivors of the protagonist’s rampage.\n\n\nI Am Your Beast is out now on PC.

I was able to get quite a bit of padding in my pocket, which made it really easy to deal with any trouble that came my way.\n\n\n\n\nThe best description I can give of Keep Driving is that it’s a lot like Oregon Trail. It’s set during the early 2000s, with you setting out in your very first car to enjoy the last days of your youth. You don’t exactly drive, but instead, set your car on its journey, then make decisions as various events turn up to complicate your relaxing drive. They range from simple potholes to livestock. Each time one pops up, you use a variety of ability cards to try and mitigate the effects it can have. You can sometimes pick up hitchhikers who can either help or hinder your trip. The goal is to keep yourself and your car together long enough to reach it to your friend’s house to play video games.\n\n\nI’m pretty excited to see how Keep Driving was improved on over the past few months. It was already in decent shape in October and just needed a bit more meat and a bit of polish.

          "description": "There are plenty of creatures you can catch in Fisch, but landing the secret fish is the hardest task to complete.\n\n\nSo far, there are three secret fish that can be caught inside the game, but they can prove to be stern tests. These three creatures are the hardest ones to catch, and they're not even part of the official bestiary. Let's take a look at how you can obtain them inside the game. \n\n\nHow to catch all  three secret fish in Fisch\n\n\nAs of the latest Atlantean Storm update, there are three fish to catch. \n\n\nFish\nType\nLocation\nPreferred Bait\nSeason\nWeather\n\n\n\n\nBanana Fish\nSecret\nAncient Isle\nNone\nSummer\nRain\n\n\nLong Pike\nSecret\nOcean Territory\nInsects\nAutumn, Spring\nRain\n\n\nMustard Fish\nSecret\nOcean Territory\nSea Weed\nSummer\nRain\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe greatest difficulty of getting the secret fish are their spawn rate. They're not part of the official bestiary, which means that you're not supposed to find them inside the game. The Banana Fish, for example, is only meant for admins and partnered content creators. Yet, you might get lucky and land one with the correct setup.\n\n\nThankfully, you don't really need the very best rods to land them. You should fully focus on Season, Weather, and Bait, along with the locations. The odds of landing these fish are low to begin with. Without the preferred setup, it will be next to impossible to catch these creatures, irrespective of your rod and player levels. \n\nThe post How to get all secret Fishes in Fisch appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "To celebrate Palworld's first anniversary, Pocketpair has revealed the game's Early Access roadmap, offering players a glimpse at the content they can expect to receive on the road to a 1.0 release.\n\n\nPalworld came out of the gates swinging at the start of 2024, becoming a surprise mega-hit for Pocketpair despite still being an Early Access title. The game's unique \"Pokemon with guns\" theme was enough to pique gamers' curiosities, making the game an overnight success. While the player count hasn't remained at the dizzying heights of its launch period, Palworld remains extremely popular.\n\n\nPalworld teases Early Access roadmap\n\n\nDespite Palworld's popularity, Pocketpair never rested on its laurels, continuing to deliver frequent content for players. Now, as it celebrates the game's first anniversary, the developer has revealed the future roadmap as Palworld hurtles toward its 1.0 release.\n\n\nImage via Pocketpair\n\n\nBefore Palworld fully launches, there are some pretty big features on the way. Headlining the roadmap is the addition of co-op crossplay, which will allow you to team up with your friends no matter where they play. The chance to transfer Pals between worlds and a potential ending scenario should also be an exciting prospect for fans. \n\n\nAlso in the pipeline is the already-announced Palworld x Terraria crossover, although this roadmap seems to hint at even more collaborations in the future. Then, there are the seemingly obvious things such as new Pals and technologies, which most could have guessed were on the way at some point. Finally, the roadmap reaches the generic \"Other Improvements\" category, promising vague improvements across the board in various areas.\n\n\nAt the moment, Pocketpair has yet to provide a timeline for all of its planned Early Access content. Given the scale of the updates released over the last 12 months, it's not impossible to think most of the roadmap content will arrive in 2025.\n\nThe post Palworld looks to the future as it reveals Early Access roadmap appeared first on Destructoid.",

Something similar, or even better, could be waiting for us as part of the next update. Thankfully, the wait isn't long, and there's less than a week before the upcoming update goes live.\n\n\nFisch Atlantis update release date\n\n\nTypically, new updates are always released on Saturdays in Fisch at 1 p.m. GMT/5 a.m. PST/8 a.m. EST. Since the Northern Expedition update, we have had three weekends of mini-content updates in preparation for the Atlantis core update. As per the existing schedule, the next core update will go live on Saturday, January 25.\n\n\nUnless there is any more delay, we will get a new update after four weeks from the previous core update. It will be interesting to find out what the developers have in plan for the community.\n\n\nWhat to expect from the Atlantis update in Fisch\n\n\nIt's safe to expect something similar to the Northern Expedition update. We might end up with a new region, along with a fresh bestiary, rods, and more. In Northern Expedition, 36 new species were added. I believe a lot of new fish will be added to the game very soon.\n\n\nIt has been a long time since a new rod was added to the game as well. We have had a few good additions like Rod of the Exalted One since Northern Expedition, but we might finally have multiple ones as part of the Atlantis update.\n\n\nSo far, the developers haven't given a sneak peek of the contents coming to Fisch as part of the next update. We will have detailed guides about the upcoming update once it goes live.\n\nThe post When will the Atlantis update release in Fisch appeared first on Destructoid.",

Here’s a shiny new package for you to unwrap, containing the first beta version of the upcoming OpenTTD 15 release. It comes faster, with road waypoints, fewer passwords, better scenario editor, and hopefully with a lot less bugs. To be a bit less vague, here are some of the highlights: Improved picker windows for stations/waypoints/objects/and more. Oh, and that does include road waypoints. Better perfomance in various places, including faster path signals that are now green by default. Password-less network authentication using keys. Several improvements for NewGRFs regarding cargo support. Better scenario editor with a town data importer and manual house placement. A large tree fully hung with ornamental bugfixes. Sadly though, not everbody was good this year. The old NPF pathfinder was finally retired, after YAPF being the superior default for many, many years now. There’s a lot of bugs left for you to find, though, guaranteed. Enjoy the beta, test all the things and report anything you find amiss, to make OpenTTD 15 the best OpenTTD 15 ever.

          "description": "Měl jsem z toho převládající WTF pocit, který byl víceméně příjemný, protože něco takového se hned tak nevidí a bylo jasné, že tvůrci měli nějakou jasnou dramatickou vizi - i když jsem ji nepochopil. Mělo to mít nějakou jinou \"message\" než \"když jsi psychopatický gangster, špatně dopadneš\"? Ale docela to uteklo. Jednoznačné mínus a nechtěný (zřejmě?) humor tkví ve skutečnosti, že hlavní hrdinka (t.j. žena) pořád vypadá jako nabušený chlap v paruce a během celého filmu to žádné jiné postavě nepřijde divné.

Ve filmu je mnoho víceminutových scén, při kterých se NIKDO v plném sále ani neuchechtl, a to je tohoto typu snímku na pováženou. (Ilča 40 %)",

Hudebně vychází z původní lidové písně a již dávno zažité sestupné basové linky původně inspirované čardášem. V monumentální instrumentaci zaznívá důstojné a bohaté \"hradní\" Maestoso s výraznou smyčcovou figurací a dramatické Presto s vypjatým protihlasem tak kontrastně jako dunajské nížiny a Vysoké Tatry. Důvodem vzniku bylo hledání krásy a síly slovenské hudby s duchovním nadhledem mně tolik blízké mahlerovské angažovanosti. Velmi důležitá při tom pro mě byla noblesa a hudební kultivovanost při zachování původní písně. Nový rozměr je u mě h…",
