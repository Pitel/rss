          "description": "Australia was confirmed first.\nUpdate:Nintendo of Europe has confirmed that the Booster Course Pass Wave 1 content will go live at midnight CET, which is 11pm UK. This matches up with the Australian release time, but there's no confirmation yet that it'll arrive in NA at its equivalent times - 4pm Pacific / 7pm Eastern. \n\nOriginal Article: We're not sure why, but Nintendo has an odd insistence on not confirming release times for digital versions of games and DLC. On most occasions games land at midnight local time, but sometimes they don't, so we have to resort to checking our Switch late at night and crossing our weary fingers.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "No, you can't play the new tracks yet.\nAs expected, especially in light of recent server maintenance, Nintendo has released the next big update for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, taking it up to the giddy heights of Version 2.0.0. It's a meatier download and evidently installs the new tracks for the Booster Course Pass (Wave 1), with the previous 'pre-load' for the content being so small that it was clearly just an unlock key.\nTo spare your suspense, no, the download doesn't enable the new courses yet. It's officially due on 18th March, though we do know the release times for Europe and Australia; it points to the content potentially arriving a little earlier than expected in some territories. We'll find out soon enough.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Hell, many an impressionable teenager hit pause to glimpse Chun-Li’s undies back in the day, and Capcom knew it. Sex sells, and, like all commercial media, video game developers aren’t immune to slapping some greasy smut on-disc in the hope of cementing another sale. Boobs, butts, oily pecs and sculpted crotches: gaming has seen it all — and Switch owners have seen more than ever before on a Nintendo console.\nThe majority of Gal Gun’s cattle-like cast, however, are Japanese high-schoolers. Whether or not they’re Junior or Senior students is left ambiguous, making the premise of sexually gratifying its targets largely at odds with legal systems across most of the world, which explains its banning in countries like New Zealand and Germany. 'But hey, they’re just, like, cartoons, man' is certainly one common argument in their defence.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

I was fine by myself, like any good romcom protagonist at the start of the movie.\nAs I walked into the final boss arena, I had unwaivering confidence. I strolled in, staff at the ready and prepared to win. Then, my string of easy victories came to a shocking end. I got walloped and decimated for about 10 hours and eventually announced my defeat. Elden Ring was a game I just couldn’t finish. Fortunately, love had other plans, and I entered into a whirlwind romance with the Mimic Tear Ash.\nRead more",

          "description": "GPU-based upscaling has proven to be one of the most useful additions to gaming PC tech in years. Big performance improvements in exchange for only a minor drop in visual quality, if any at all? Yes please and thank you. Nvidia’s DLSS has established itself as the gold standard of upscalers, outperforming AMD’s FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR), but the Radeon makers are now readying two new offerings: FSR 2.0 and Radeon Super Resolution (RSR).\r\n\n\r\nFSR 2.0 looks to be a straight upgrade on the current 1.0 version, promising sharper picture quality with “optimised anti-aliasing” to better compete with the built-in, AI-assisted edge smoothing of DLSS. It will still need to be implemented in games by their developers, though – unlike RSR, which aims to work with just about any game by applying its upscaling algorithm at the GPU driver level.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "The folks over at Eastshade Studios sure do have a brand, don’t they? Cozy, rustic, slow-going living with a touch of the magical has a certain appeal all its own, and as the recent announcement of Songs Of Glimmerwick proves, EastStud don’t intend on shaking up that brand any time soon. This is a wonderful thing for me because their previous outing and namesake, Eastshade, is not only one of my favourite games of all time, but also such an important kind of game in the terrifying, nightmare world we find ourselves in today.\nYou see, Eastshade does one thing very, very well. In fact, it does it so well that most players probably won’t even have noticed until they look back and really think on it. Eastshade teaches mindfulness, a keen and acute awareness of oneself and one’s surroundings in the present moment. And that, my friends, is where the appeal comes from.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "In a move befitting a game about immortal beings who live out countless repeating lives on artificial islands powered by human sacrifice, Paradise Killer is getting a re-release. Sort of. It's coming to next-gen consoles today, with all platforms (including PC) getting some extra bits added for free that weren't in the original 2020 release. Not bad for a game that Kaizen Game Works creative director Oli Clarke Smith thought would only really sell to \"a niche of freaks\". If you're not one of those freaks, I'd heartily recommend becoming one. Playing Paradise Killer is like going to a seaside cosplay party where police procedurals play on loop and cocktails are snorted in a dehydrated powder form. It is a meticulously authored murder mystery with a cast of freaks.\nWhen I sat down to talk to both Clarke Smith and technical director Phil Crabtree about Paradise Killer's new update, it turns out that niche has already become quite large. Even Crabtree's dad has played Paradise Killer, though Crabtree isn't sure he really understood it. Crabtree also tells us he sometimes get messages from friends saying someone they know just played Paradise Killer and was talking about it. \"It just seems so weird that that there is this audience there that we never expected, and it doesn't seem that far away,\" he says. \"Like, it's not this mystery group of people, there always seems to be some connection that's quite close to you.\"\nRead more",

          "description": "If you’re unfamiliar with Redout, it’s an anti-gravity racer inspired by the likes of F-Zero and Wipeout. And if you’ve not played any of those before, then imagine a pod-racer from Star Wars belting it down Mario Kart’s Rainbow Road - except, hang on, there’s a mysterious white powder caked on the bristles of Mario’s mustache. The sheer speed of the first game made it pretty popular among race-heads, but a bit of a daunting prospect for those used to a traditional “wheels on the ground” racing experience.\nRedout 2 doubles down on the speed element, that's for sure. But there's definitely an added air of approachability to this anti-grav racer, making the transition from Geforce to g-force a little less bruising than before. AI presets, added customisation, and more generous modes help make this a racing game you should keep up with.\nRead more",

          "description": "You may not have heard much about developer Complex Games, but the Canadian studio has a surprisingly storied history. Despite spending the last two decades building mobile and browser games for the likes of Disney, Nickelodeon and Zynga, their heart has always resided with the PC. \"There wasn't a lot of game development in Winnipeg, so we tried to figure it out ourselves and spent a few years trying to build a PC game,\" says creative director Noah Decter-Jackson. Fresh out of college, Complex's first project was a third-person hand-to-hand action prototype that they pitched to publishers at E3 2003, an endeavour that Decter-Jackson describes as \"phenomenally unsuccessful\".\nThis led to Complex remodelling as a work-for-hire outfit, and their long track-record making mobile games. But in 2015, Complex launched The Horus Heresy: Drop Assault, a fast-paced tactics game in conjunction with Games Workshop. In the wake of Drop Assault's success, the studio saw an opportunity. \"We had been wanting for a long time to return to our PC roots,\" he says. \"So we pitched a core idea for a game to Games Workshop, because Drop Assault had been quite successful... and that's essentially how Chaos Gate: Daemonhunters came to be.\"\nRead more",

Depending on your choice of player two, it's also likely to be an apt description of how you'll feel playing it.\nHaving waded through an early preview build of its opening Forgotten Waters stage this week, this is one co-operative cannon fest that seems destined to see friends and family not so much walk the plank after an untimely defeat as get absolutely spanked by it. Imagine the visual chaos of a game like Overcooked combined with the frantic, tactile ship management of Lovers In A Dangerous Spacetime and you're pretty much there, albeit with several more barnacles, bug-spewing mosquitoes and laser-firing totem poles in the mix. The jangle of Davy Jones' locker is never far away in this storm-stricken archipelago, so beware, fools. You will not be suffered gladly.\nRead more",

          "description": "I can't remember if I've mentioned this to you, dear readers, but I am currently mid-emigration. In about two weeks I'm moving to Ireland, which means for the past four months my live has been hellish. The paperwork the move involves, especially now we have from our European womb been untimely ripped, is a Kafkaesque nightmare. To ship my stuff without incurring importation tax I need to prove I'm going to live in Ireland and not just sell a bunch of second hand cutlery and old bras (one of those two things would probably be pretty lucrative, in fairness). This is all complicated even furtherer by the fact that I only found a flat to move to yesterday, and still don't have the tenancy agreement for it, which means no proof of address. Life, oh life.\nI don't really have the option to have a piece of toast and watch the evening news, because when I'm not scanning my passport or estimating what worth to attach to my towels for the purposes of the shipping company's insurance, I am packing said towels into boxes, along with everything else I own. Basically the only free time I have is my lunch break. And what I am doing in my lunch break is making huge, virtual jigsaw puzzles in Jigsaw Puzzle Dreams. It's either that or go and sit in the toilets and have a little stress-cry. And as the move date approaches, the size of the puzzles has increased. On Thursday I started one that is 6k pieces. This may have been a miscalculation.\nRead more",

Audio drivers are still a work in progress, so only USB-C, 3.5mm, or Bluetooth headphones can output sound on Windows, and Valve’s post explains that dual-booting support still isn’t ready yet.

Also, Nate and I get angry at Metal Gear Solid.\nThere are some traditional digressions, although there's no substantial Henry Cavill update this week. We spend some time discussing which dinosaur we would most like to ride as a mount, and whether we would rather fight one The Rock sized spider, or 30 spider sized The Rocks.

          "description": "Social media sucks doesn't it? You sign up for a feed of dross that never stops, like you've paid for a rotten Fruit Winder that simply won't stop unwinding. Others who've bought into the same Fruit Winder exchange thoughts on its sour taste, until yet more, who quite like the flavour, come to its defense in droves. A war of words ensues over whether the Fruit Winder tastes nice. And it's not even a Fruit Winder, it's an app called Facebook, or Twitter, or Instagram, for goodness sakes.\nAdmittedly, there is something gratifying about popping off on social media. Even just getting a few likes for a dumb joke can make you feel alive. So, I say you swap Twitter for Elden Ring, a superior social media platform: You leave players helpful messages or total dross, it gets appraised, you feel great. Invading other worlds is a more interactive way of making friends and/or enemies too – it's perfect.\nRead more",

After a swim I'd stare longingly at the snacks I couldn't afford then stand on tip-toes before the game I couldn't afford to play, waggling a joystick and mashing buttons to pretend I was controlling the attract mode demo. Appealing to this sort of nostalgia, Konami have announced they're releasing a collection of 13 vintage Ninja Turtles games.\nRead more",

          "description": "This article contains spoilers for Lost Ark's main questline.\n\n\nLost Ark is a very silly game, but not in the way it initially seems. For its first 15 hours or so, Smilegate's ARPG is like someone described Lord of the Rings to the developers through a door, an overblown yet generic riff on Western fantasy tropes with overdesigned yet underwritten characters, all of whom talk about the game's plainly ridiculous lore with the gravity of a neutron star. The game's ignorance of its own absurdity is funny, but the story itself is not much fun.\r\n\n\r\nThis begins to change once you approach level 50. After completing the continent of East Luterra, Lost Ark suddenly explodes in scale. It gives you a ship, and sets you off on a massive globetrotting adventure, with around a dozen other continents to explore, and dozens more tiny islands, each with their own little questlines. Your first destination across Lost Ark's ocean is an island called Tortoyk (pronounced like \"Tortoise\", but with a K), and it's here where the game stops pretending to be a serious high-fantasy adventure, revealing itself to be something much more entertaining.\r\n\n \nRead more",

In Valhalla this manifests as protagonist Eivor, Viking raider and big blonde buff meat sculpture, being the reincarnation of Odin, one of the aforementioned god-people. Dawn Of Ragnarök is Eivor dreaming that they are Odin for about 35 hours of adventuring and son-saving in the magical realm of Svartalfheim. That's a pretty intense nap.\nRead more",

Its combat and economy chains build on each other, a feat uncommon in the real-time strategy space. Despite taking cues from beloved franchises like WarCraft and Age of Empires, TFC carves out a niche with an unlikely ally: pomegranates. The Fertile Crescent trades the ol’ berry bush for pomegranate trees, a native of Western Asia.\r\n\n\r\nDevelopers Anders Groenningsaeter and André Read from Wield Interactive looked to the past as they refined The Fertile Crescent’s economy. “Since childhood, André and I have been equally fascinated by RTS games and the Bronze Ages,” Groenningsaeter explained to me. “How we’ve been inspired by history has shaped the game. During the Bronze Ages, the usage of coins hadn’t taken root yet. It was still to a large extent a barter economy, and food played an important role.”\r\n\n \nRead more",

However, another facet of Pokémon card collecting remains popular: buying extremely rare ones at auctions. \nFor example, a rare Illustrator Pikachu card sold for nearly $1 million last month. Now, the latest rare Pokémon card sold at auction is making the rounds in the trading card community: a Snap Magikarp card, one of 20 known to exist. First reported by Nintendo Life, these Snap cards were given to winners of a Pokémon Snap competition held in Japan decades ago. If you were a winner, your winning Pokémon Snap in-game photograph was turned into an actual Pokémon card, so not only are these rare right off the bat as a result but only 20 of each was made.\nNintendo Life reports that one of 20 Snap Magikarp cards was recently sold at a Japanese auction for 5 million yen, or roughly $136,000. You can watch this video about the card below, uploaded by smpratte, the person who appears to be the winner: \nClick here to watch embedded media\nWith this one sold, there’s another 19 out there somewhere. Perhaps people safely own those other 19, or maybe, they’ve been lost to time. For now, they remain as elusive as a Magikarp doing its best not to bite the bait on an Old Rod (ok, maybe they’re a little more elusive than that). \nFor more, read about the Illustrator Pikachu card sold last month and then check out the upcoming Pokémon Go trading card packs being released in stores soon. \n[Source: Nintendo Life]\nHave you ever seen one of these rare Pokémon Snap cards?

Here’s what to expect with each of these three Sega Genesis games:\nAlien Soldier\n“In Alien Soldier, the acclaimed developers at Treasure invite you to take on the role of a bird-man with steel wings in his fight against 25 bosses. In this challenging game, you can learn new tactics with every defeat…or take advantage of that handy Rewind feature to perfect your run.”\nAlien Soldier is a run-and-gun action game first released for the Genesis in 1995. In the U.S., it was only available via the Sega Channel cable service. The game was re-released on the PlayStation 2, and years later, it was released again on the Wii Virtual Channel and Steam. \nSuper Fantasy Zone\n“Super Fantasy Zone has you powering up the ever-appearing Opa-Opa across eight colorful planets.” \nSuper Fantasy Zone launched on the Sega Genesis, or Mega Drive, in Japan in 1992. It wouldn’t hit the U.S. until 2008, when it was released on the Wii. \nLight Crusader\n“In Light Crusader, also from Treasure, let nobility light your way through a lovingly crafted action-RPG.” \nLight Crusader arrived on the Genesis in 1995, before it was re-released on Steam 15 years later in 2010. It combines elements of RPG, action, and platforming in one package. \nAre you excited about these Sega Genesis games? Let us know in the comments below!",

It’s been doing EA Play Live since 2016. Before the onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the event was a live in-person event where players could play things shown during the showcase and more. However, as a result of the pandemic, the event became a steaming one, akin to something like a Nintendo Direct or PlayStation State of Play. \nThis news comes just a few months after word that E3 would not be held as in-person event this year dropped. However, Geoff Keighley’s own E3-like event, Summer Games Fest, is happening this year as usual. \nWhile waiting to see what EA shows throughout the year, check out the latest footage of its Dead Space remake.

That’s because the game sports not one, not two, but six graphical and performance options.\nWe’re reviewing Ghostwire: Tokyo and have listed each mode along with their in-game explanation. However, the game only lays out what the two primary modes do, which are:  \nQuality Mode: A high-fidelity rendering mode with ray tracing enabled. 30 FPS limit\nPerformance Mode: A high-framerate mode designed for the smoothest gameplay. 60 FPS limit.\nAdditionally, a category labeled HFR (High Framerate) is described as having \"an uncapped framerate and tweaks to graphic quality that allow for an even higher-framerate experience.\" It contains four options without descriptions, but Video Games Chronicle expounded on these which we’ve shared below:\nHigh Framerate Quality: Quality mode with an uncapped framerate between 30-50 FPS.\nHigh Framerate Performance: Performance mode with uncapped framerate over 60 FPS.\nHigh Framerate Quality (VSync): Same as High Framerate Quality but with Vsync enabled. \nHigh Framerate Performance (VSync): Same as High Framerate Performance but with Vsync enabled.\nGames with multiple graphical/performance options have become the norm in recent years, but Ghostwire: Tokyo may take the cake, and figuring out which one is “best” will depend on several factors (such as your monitor) as well as personal preference. \nGhostwire: Tokyo launches March 25 on PlayStation 5 and PC.

The digital edition of the DLC will be available for preorder today, producer Ryozo Tsujimoto revealed. Along with the base edition of Sunbreak, existing Monster Hunter Rise players will have the option to purchase a deluxe edition, which comes with additional cosmetics like Layered Armod, hairstyles, poses, and gestures. Preordering will net hunters a pair of adorable Palamute and Palico Layered Armor that make the animal companions look closer to their real-world pet counterparts.\nThose who are new to Monster Hunter Rise, but want the whole experience when Sunbreak releases can purchase the Monster Hunter Rise + Sunbreak Set which bundles the full base game and the expansion together into one tidy package.\nAnnounced to be released alongside Sunbreak is a new trio of Monster Hunter Amiibos. The set of three includes new Elder Dragon Malzeno and a Palamute and Palico each donning armor based on Malzeno. Using these Amiibos with the Switch version will grant players new Formal Dragon Layered Armor to use in-game.\nA patch will be coming for all Monster Hunter Rise players on June 30 regardless of Sunbreak ownership status. The update will require about 13GB of storage space and will accommodate for weapon balance changes and new content coming to the game with the release of Sunbreak. This patch will be required for online play moving forward.\nIf you're interested in trying out Monster Hunter Rise with Sunbreak looming on the horizon, Nintendo is offering a free trial for Switch Online subscribers this week.",

More specifically, the survey recently sent out is all about the graphics and visuals of Babylon’s Fall, and finding a way to “bring everyone an even better game experience.” \nEurogamer reports that the survey asks players about their thoughts on the visuals of characters, equipment, NPCs, enemies, locales, battle effects, the UI, and the overall oil painting “brushwork” art style of Babylon’s Fall. The survey concludes by asking survey-takers what specific element of Babylon’s Fall’s visuals would need to be changed before they’d consider recommending the game to someone else. \nHowever, as anyone who’s played Babylon’s Fall or has read reviews for it know, there are multiple problems beyond the visual elements that make it hard to recommend. Perhaps Square Enix will canvass players about all of the elements viewed more negatively in the game and then fix each one so that with all of the fixes together, people might be able to recommend the game to someone. That remains to be seen, of course. \nIf you’re curious about checking the game out yourself, you can do so thanks to a free PlayStation demo for Babylon’s Fall that’s available right now.

          "description": "If you can’t get enough of everyone’s favorite blue blur, or Tails and Knuckles, as they’re depicted in Paramount Pictures’ movies, then we have some good news for you: there’s a “pre-quill” comic book for Sonic the Hedgehog 2 coming out later this month. \nAs reported by Sonic Stadium, this prequel comic will lead into Sonic the Hedgehog 2 before it hits theaters on April 8 and part of it will be helmed by the movie’s own Dr. Robotnik, Jim Carrey. That’s because the comic book isn’t one big story but rather, five stories about different characters from the movie spread across 40 pages. One of these five stories will be centered on Dr. Robotnik and according to Sonic Stadium, Carrey is “spearheading” it. \nHowever, it’s important to note that Carrey does not have a writer’s credit in the comic solicitation so it’s likely that he simply helped out with the narrative, or shared ideas with the comic’s writer, Keil Phegley. \n“Catch up with Sonic and friends, if you can, in this exclusive prequel to 2022’s most anticipated family film,” the comic book’s solicitation reads, according to Sonic Stadium. “Life is good in Green Hills for Sonic the Hedgehog…maybe too good. He’s starting to get bored, and when Sonic gets bored, things become a lot less boring for everyone else – fast. Quicker than you can say, ‘Chili Dog,’ the Fastest Thing Alive is saving the day and causing all sorts of chaos along the way. Plus, new and returning characters starring in the Sonic the Hedgehog 2 film take the lead in stories of their own.” \nFor more about Sonic, check out this awesome poster for the movie, and then watch the final trailer for Sonic the Hedgehog 2 released today. Read about Sonic Frontiers, which drops the blue blur into his first open-world game, after that. \n[Source: Sonic Stadium]\nAre you going to pick up this prequel comic?

Ultimate, it seems. And while he’s back to work, a new statement from the director teases that what he’s working on might not be a video game. \nNews of Sakurai’s return to work comes from Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu, as translated by GoNintendo, which reports that Sakurai has revealed that he is, in fact, working on something. As for what, we might find out in the near future but Sakurai hints that it might not be related to gaming in any way. \n“I have been away for a while now, but I am working on something,” Sakurai told Famitsu, as translated by GoNintendo. “My eyes may be a little tired. You may see me in the near future in a place that has nothing to do with game production. You may or may not be able to see me. I hope to see you again in the future. Thank you very much for your time.” \nAs you can see in the statement above, Sakurai seems to be dropping hints to his fans that they shouldn’t be expecting a new game from him anytime soon. Perhaps he’s working on something that’s very behind-the-scenes, or maybe he’s jumped industries and is now working in movie production or something like that. Only time will tell. \nFor now, read about Sakurai’s journey to get Sora from Kingdom Hearts, the final fighter in Ultimate, in the game, and then check out this story about how Sakurai isn’t thinking about a sequel to Ultimate but won’t rule one out despite that. Read about how Sakurai thinks the next game in the Smash Bros. series would need a smaller roster and less dependence on his own vision after that. \n[Source: Famitsu via GoNintendo]\nAre you excited to see what Sakurai is working on?
