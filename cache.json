Not so much in the sense that you can brag to your friends about owning something they couldn't possibly hope to get their hands on; no, that's quite insufferable, if you ask us. Rather, the idea of owning something valuable and precious, taking the effort to look after it and keep it in good condition is a wholly different story.\nWe'd be willing to bet that quite a few of you lovely readers probably own a rare video game or a rare piece of merchandise of some sort. We'd also be willing to bet that most of you would much rather keep hold of such an item for as long as possible, regardless of its potential value. After all, owning something of such prestige from a beloved IP means something, right? It makes us feel connected to a franchise we love in a way that's particularly difficult to replicate.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Ne'er touch the muffin pan since. No, of course it's our favourite video games that made big swings but didn't quite hit, a Nate Crowley-backed themed - and he kicks us off with a bid discussion about the infamous Jurassic Park tie-in game Trespasser. Try spelling \"jurassic\" properly first time; I've never been able too. \nDiversions this week are discussing classic UK subterranean tourist attractions Wookey Hole and Cheddar Gorge, and how Matthew's life could have been different if only he'd been Wookey Hole's witch mascot. Nate has bought a model kit for one of those massive excavation machines, which he says is \"about as big as an Alsatian\" and \"basically a bin-bag full of girders\". So he is turning it into an Orc sewage treatment plant. Standard week to be honest.\nRead more",

It's like that, but at a university,\" but that would also be the lazy way out. In reality, the weirdest person I knew at uni only wore a top hat and an opera cape to campus once as a joke (and now has a proper job), and Two Point Campus is actually a way more complex and weird management sim than Two Point Studios' previous - and indeed, ongoing - hospital effort.\nRead more",

Heck, Scream 5 even opens with a joke about how kids today only like 'prestige' horror like The Babadook.\nI'm convinced that there's a middle ground, where you can have a slasher horror that loves the tropes and knows how to work them, but still feels smart and fresh in 2022. And, preferably, stars pro-wrestler and part-time actor David Arquette. This week I played some of The Quarry.\nRead more",

A tactical card-based game that’s been in early access since last June, Rose City Games’ adventure stars Phoebe, an absolutely adorable and excruciatingly optimistic nerd who delights in tackling problems facing her community. To this end Phoebe’s only gone and constructed her own AI, Carlton, and the two help out townsfolk by destroying monsters with their own beasties. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "We did a lot of cool things during our time at this year's PAX East. We attended a wonderful talk by \"Skyrim Grandma\" Shirley Curry. We gawked at the coolest booths on the show floor. I got nightmares after looking at a super cursed baby. My personal highlight, though, was talking to the Pinny Arcade collectors during the show's official trading event.\r\n\n\r\nI’ll admit, before I went to PAX I didn’t really appreciate how big Pinny Arcade was. I’d definitely seen photos of colourful metal pins depicting characters from various video games fly across my screen as I browsed Twitter, but I had never thought much about them beyond that. I was shocked, then, to arrive at PAX and realise just how integral this collectable is to the show. Merch booths sell starter packs, individual demo stations flog game specific rarities and avid fans adorn their lanyards with their favourite pieces. It turns out, Pinny Arcade is huge. \r\n\n \nRead more",

This is all by way of introduction to Eternal Threads, a puzzle game where you go back in time to stop everyone in a house share dying in a fire. \nTo save a present that has been rendered apocalyptic by time travel itself, you are part of a team who go back and change tiny things in the past to fix it, in this case 2015. While it is imperative for some reason that the fire does indeed happen, it is just as important that all six occupants live. You can alter small decisions they make in the week running up to the fire, and so save their lives by choosing whether they go to the pub, if they comfort each other in times of need, or what they have arguments about.

With its late summer release fast approaching, Volition recently showed off a larger chunk of some actual gameplay to press in another remote preview session. It looks almost exactly like what you'd expect it to look like: a fun open world game where you shoot people and smash cars into other cars.\nBarring any catastrophic eventualities where this game actually ends up being just a load of bugs propping up other bugs in a fluorescent trenchcoat, I feel almost 100% confident in saying to you that this will be an enjoyable product when it comes out. But I also should be honest and say that the gameplay I saw has congealed into the same kind of sticky morass and blurred whirling lights in my memory as my first all-night benders. It's a big collage of colours and explosions, and words like \"cops\", \"switch car\" and \"plan\", leaving a general impression of fun but, so far, few specifics in its wake. And to be even more frank about it all, I can't think of a nailed on reason why any of it has to be a Saints Row game.\nRead more",

Vampire: The Masquerade - Swansong has taught me that they actually spend most of their time walking around looking at things, sometimes stopping to have tense conversations or pick up keycards. There is occasional eating.\nThis is probably because the three vampires you play as in Swansong aren't exactly on their down-time. Set in Boston in 2019, you begin in medias res after a sudden violent attack on a party has left the Boston vampire court reeling. The Prince, an Annie Lennox cosplayer called Hazel Iverson, has called three of her most trusted lieutenants in to firstly check on the immediate aftermath, and thereafter investigate the wider fallout and strike against whodunnit. Since developers Big Bad Wolf are the folks behind The Council, the role you take isn't an action hero but different shades of spy and/or detective. Neither leaves you much time to loaf about being all sexy, though. \nRead more",

Since then I have been carrying out a more robust set of around 100 benchmarks across the original Graviton instance, Graviton2, Graviton3, and then up again Intel Xeon and AMD EPYC competing instances. Here is that much larger collection of Graviton3 performance benchmarks carried out on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.",

While each movie, from Sam Raimi's seminal 1983 classic to Fede Álvarez's great 2013 remake, has brought iconic characters, delirious carnage, and bucketfuls of the red stuff, the video game exploits of franchise star Ash Williams have never quite lived up to the series' inherent potential.\nFrom the original bland computer game (1984), through the boring and cumbersome Hail to the King (2000), the blah Fistful of Boomstick (2003), and the tepid Evil Dead Regeneration (2005), the horror franchise has struggled to truly deliver the relentless, m…",

          "description": "Get caught up on the BioShock series in one fell swoop\nThe new Epic Games Store freebie is live, and it's a three-for-one. BioShock: The Collection is free on Epic, now through June 2.\nThe Collection packages together BioShock Remastered, BioShock 2: Remastered, and BioShock Infinite: The Complete Edition. All three versions of these games include all of their corresponding single-player DLC.\nSo alongside three immersive shooters, there are also some pretty solid DLC additions here, like Minerva's Den for BioShock 2 and Burial at Sea for Infinite. Essentially, it's a complete package of all things BioShock up to present day. And the first BioShock also includes a Director's Commentary too.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdEJDEWTpO4\nThere have been plenty of freebies handed out through the Epic Games Store's giveaways, but the full BioShock is a pretty rad package. You can check it out via the Epic launcher or the link here. The next free game hasn't been revealed yet, but will unlock a week from now, roughly.\nThere's always a lighthouse\nAs for the BioShock series, well, we haven't seen much of it since the conclusion of Infinite. A new BioShock has ostensibly been in development at Cloud Chamber, but it's been some time since we heard anything about it.\nSo while its spiritual predecessors in games like System Shock are also in development, BioShock is up in the air. June is just around the corner, the perfect time for game announcements. But we've yet to see anything notable that could indicate news on the way.\nFor now, a return to Rapture is much more likely, thanks to this BioShock Epic freebie. Or, if you're in a musical mood, you can check out the award-winning BioShock high school show choir adaptation. I mean, say what you want about any of the games, but BioShock does have some great music.\nThe post BioShock: The Collection is free on the Epic Games Store appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Are You Afraid of the Dark?\nThe super-cute, super-spoopy Japanese ghost story Yomawari 3 is officially headed to these shores. As announced by publisher NIS America, the freshly re-monikered Yomawari: Lost in the Dark will launch on PS4, PC, and Nintendo Switch this fall, hopefully in time for Halloween!\nAs previously reported, Yomawari: LitD sees a young girl on an intrepid and spine-chilling quest to free her hometown from a mysterious curse. Armed with little more than steel nerves and a flashlight, our teeny hero must brave the avenues, alleyways, woodland, and interiors of the haunted town, gathering clues and learning the lore behind the town's fate and her own part to play in its legacy.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5gWOnu7tSA\nLacking in combat skills, our nameless protagonist must use cunning, guile, and the overwhelming power of closing their eyes in order to outwit and outmaneuver her ghostly opposition. Listen to your own heartbeat to detect oncoming presences  On the plus side, the character is fully customizable... So at least you can look fabulous while fighting off legions of the undead.\nWith a strong emphasis on tension, dread, and hair-raising chills over violent shocks and lame jump-scares, Lost in the Dark looks to be a delightfully creepy ghost story in the more classical horror sense, and may eventually prove to be the perfect title to play when you're all safely snuggled up in bed on those cold fall nights.\nJust don't look under the bed.\nYomawari: Lost in the Dark launches in the west on PS4, PC, and Nintendo Switch this fall.\nThe post Yomawari: Lost in the Dark headed west on PS4, PC, and Switch appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Following Patch 6.1\nFinal Fantasy XIV has been having some network hiccups lately. No, not nearly as catastrophic as the launch of Endwalker! But still notable to the point where the team is putting up a blog asking folks to send in reports of their own FFXIV network issues.\nAs is the case with many missives, the game's own producer Naoki \"Yoshi P\" Yoshida took to the game's blog to notify users of \"network-related issues,\" including packet loss and lag. The culprit is patch 6.1, which was implemented back on April 12. So far, this is the result of their investigation:\n\"Based on the information that most of the recent reports are specifically coming from Japan, while others are playing without issue, the network-related issues may be due to the network routing. In the past month, some of the internet service providers (ISP) in Japan have been reporting issues due to high network concentration or trouble related to construction. That said, it may still be possible for us to contact the ISP and work together to see if we can resolve the issues.\"\nHowever, if you're having FFXIV network issues, Yoshi P says you should report them here under the \"providing information on packet loss and lag\" topic. The blog then walks users through how to provide traceroute info (/run tracert). Hopefully they figure it out and it doesn't impact you!\nThe post The FFXIV team is investigating recent network issues appeared first on Destructoid.",

You know the ones where in some fighting games you'd \"clash,\" and the best masher would win? Or any number of Mario Party minigames? Whenever one of the latter would show up in one of my friend groups, someone tried to sabotage me by grabbing my controller because they knew their defeat was inevitable — but I think it's time to recognize the master button masher.\nTakahashi Meijin is a legend that's been in the industry for decades, making his name at Hudson Soft. He's perhaps most famous for the \"16 shot per second\" mashing technique. In short, Takahashi-san managed to mash so quickly that he could trigger \"16 shots per second,\" and actually put it on film in the '80s.\nWell, the master button masher is back at it again. In a tweet (from his account meijin_16shot), he shows that even at age 63, he's still got it: absolutely crushing the Mario Party SuperStars minigame Pokey Pummel. That face of accomplishment at the end! I can only hope to still be playing games this capably at that age.\nhttps://twitter.com/meijin_16shot/status/1529431994702016513\nHere's Takashi showing off his \"16 shot\" skills back in the day using Hudson Soft's Shuwatch:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJ4lmAFB7d4\nThe post Even at age 63, Takahashi Meijin is still a master button masher appeared first on Destructoid.",

So consider this a warning, as famed From Software director Hidetaka Miyazaki just shared his favorite Elden Ring boss with everyone today, and we're going to talk about it!\n\nThanks to an interview from Xbox Wire, straight from Miyazaki's mouth, we know that his favorite boss is Starscourge Radahn, or just \"Radahn.\" I can see why!\nRadahn made a huge impact on me when I was playing, to the point where, once the game was fully out, I told our own Jordan Devore \"there's a boss in the game that is unlike any other from the SekiSoulsBornes, you'll know it when you see it.\" Miyazaki says that he loves the whole vibe with Radahn, that it's centered around a festival, and the juxtaposition of the loneliness of the character and the upbeat nature of the festival itself. The concept of a melancholy celebration sounds like an extremely Miyazaki thing.\nHe says that if he had to pick a runner-up, it would be Godrick the Grafted (one of the first bosses you can fight) or Rykard Lord of Blasphemy (the snake). Both great choices! I mean, if you ask any 100 people what their favorite EldenSekiSoulsBorne boss is, you're going to get an array of answers. Well, possibly zero votes for the Fire Giant, but an array nonetheless!\nThe post Miyazaki shares his favorite Elden Ring boss appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "If you can dig out your Xbox 360, have at it\nFans battle constantly over what constitutes the \"worst Sonic games in the series,\" and many have narrowed it down to Sonic '06 at the top of the list; otherwise known as Sonic the Hedgehog. Helmed by Yuji Naka, Sega attempted to make both a 15th anniversary blowout game and a \"serious\" take on the franchise, and both blew up in their faces. It got so bad that the game is only remembered today by the general public as \"the game where Sonic kisses a human woman,\" and Sega subsequently delisted the game (among others it deemed critical failures). Until now. Sonic reloaded? More like Sonic relisted.\nMysteriously, thanks to a fan tip, we've learned that Sonic '06 is back on the menu as a Sonic relisted special, as clear as day, alongside of a ton of \"picture packs\" (remember those?) and even some DLC. The kicker is that it's on Xbox 360 (sans backward compatibility), and it's five bucks.\nDepending on who you ask, this is where the Sonic series took a sharp decline. Sonic Adventure 2 and Heroes didn't quite ruin the series' reputation despite their flaws, but following this we got Sonic and the Black Knight, as well as Sonic Unleashed — which drew the ire of Sonic fans across the world. Of course, some say the fall happened earlier, with November 2005's Shadow the Hedgehog.\nIn any case, Sonic '06 is where it reached critical mass and people weren't going to take it anymore. But for the sake of game preservation, Sega shouldn't hide their history. They should remember it, learn from it, and make it available to posterity. In other words: \"please be good, Sonic Frontiers.\"\nThe post The infamous Sonic ’06 has been relisted on Xbox appeared first on Destructoid.",

Following on from 2021's attractive diorama of Devil May Cry's Dante, this new statue immortalizes one of the most iconic and recognizable video game characters of all time, Street Fighter's Chun-Li.\nStanding at 1/4 scale (roughly 30 inches in height, including base), this gorgeous statue depicts The Strongest Woman in the World as she appears in Street Fighter V, bedecked in her classic Street Fighter II costume and daubed in its alternate pink coloring. The highly dynamic posing sees Chunners flowing with powerful energy, just a frame away from unleashing her devastating Critical Art attack.\n\nClearly, the fight has raged for quite some time, as our hero stands atop the debris of a decimated \"Bustling Side Street\" stage. The K.O. is most assuredly close. This Limited Edition also comes packaged with an alternate head, allowing fans to pose the Interpol agent in full focused combat mode, or coyly winking at the hapless opponent about to get sent into the stratosphere.\nNow, the damage. The Premium Masterline Street Fighter V Chun-Li Pink Costume Limited Edition statue (phew) is no slouch on the wallet, retailing for a princely $1,099 USD (not including shipping). Truly limited, the statue has a meager format size of only 150, so she will be quite rare, even by premium statue standards. If you are a die-hard fan of the battlin' babe, then you can place your pre-order over on the official Prime 1 Studio store right now. Payment options are available, with Chunners expected to ship in late-2022/early 2023.\nYatta!\nThe post Stunning Chun-Li statue coming to Kikoken your bank account appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Jigsaw not quite falling into place\nBloober Team almost ended up tackling a very different horror franchise than Blair Witch. In a new interview, Bloober CEO Piotr Babieno says the studio was offered the chance to take on several horror IPs including Saw, but passed on them for Blair Witch.\nSpeaking to IGN during the Digital Dragons games conference in Poland, Babieno described how the Blair Witch deal came to be. Bloober was in talks with multiple major movie studios, but passed on offers. Then came Lionsgate.\nLionsgate expressed admiration for Layers of Fear and Observer. The studio offered a list of horror IPs and, according to Babieno, offered Bloober its choice of one.\n\"We could [have chosen] Saw, which is more popular than Blair Witch, but we decided to take Blair Witch because the universe has many opportunities to build something new,\" said Babieno. \"That was the reason why we chose this project.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhaDPDf-xsM\nHe goes on to say that being offered these licenses wasn't a one-off, and the studio has received more offers since Blair Witch. Bloober Team turned them down though, due to other projects in the pipeline.\n\"Unfortunately, for almost one year, we have [had to say] 'pass' to almost everything, because we don't have capacity to do any more titles at one time,\" said Babieno.\nTime to play a game\nIt's an interesting game of what-if to play, imagining Bloober's version of a Saw video game. The team went on to tackle Blair Witch instead though, and has seemingly kept busy since.\nCurrently, Bloober is working with Konami, though the product of that partnership hasn't been announced. That hasn't stopped the studio from being the subject of Silent Hill speculation, though.\nThe team is also working on another project with Take-Two publishing arm Private Division, and another that Babieno teases is in pre-production.\nThe post Bloober Team passed on the chance to make a Saw game in favor of Blair Witch appeared first on Destructoid.",

A trusty little device that has gotten you through long nights and tough times is suddenly no more, and having to let go of a console that has a lot of memories attached to it can definitely sting. While most of us are likely to take our dead device to an e-waste center and move onto the next one, some gamers out there seem to be a bit more sentimental — and technically skilled in dismantling old hardware.\nIn a post on the r/gaming Subreddit, user Wolve5000 showed off their memorialized Nintendo DS Lite, and it has to be one of the most beautiful ways I've ever seen someone recycle an old console.

From crazy-eyed alpacas and magical unicorns, to yee-hawing ponies and even a grumpy lil' goat, TFH combines cartoon quality art and animation with solid, old-school mechanics for a unique fighting game experience.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92rTB2wyPPo\nOriginally conceived as a My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic fan game, developer Mane6 quickly readjusted its design plans when Hasbro lawyers came a'callin. This proved to be the best thing that could happen for the project, however, and with fresh designs from Friendship is Magic creator Lauren Faust at hand, the Mane6 team embarked on its own original scrapper. A true passion project, Them's Fightin' Herds has seen more intensive and passionate developer support than many fighters 50 times its size and popularity.\nThe console edition of Them's Fightin' Herds will launch for $19.99.

As the below video on the Zelda: Breath of the Wild detail points out, there are actually two ways the final memory can play out:\nOne involves Link finding the memory as normal (this is the path most players will take).\nThe other includes a subtle extra bit of footage, provided that players actually take a photo of the picture on the wall in Impa's abode.\nThe short video showcases all of the differences, starting with the \"alternate\" cut, then showing the way 99% of the playerbase likely saw it: followed by a supercut of both endings in one, with the former lasting a tad longer in length.\nLike many Zelda: Breath of the Wild discoveries, a lot of people are probably like \"so, what?\" But the fact that so many of these sorts of things exist is a testament to its enduring legacy. Folks are still uncovering little tricks of the trade, and in an era where nearly everything is spoiled online in a week and everything is forgotten quickly, that's a feat.\nWhile some are tired of the Breath of the Wild discourse, for once, I'm glad that a game can live on beyond the initial zeitgeist explosion.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDYOH-ZJs2U&t\nThe post Check out this really cool subtle Zelda: Breath of the Wild final memory detail appeared first on Destructoid.",

Originally, developer Sad Cat Studios was aiming for a 2022 launch. But today, the studio announced Replaced has been delayed to 2023.\nSad Cat Studios is based out of Belarus, with a team of developers from Belarus and Ukraine. In today's statement, the team cites the ongoing war in Ukraine, saying it has heavily impacted the development of Replaced, as most of the team resides in neighboring regions.\n\"The priority for Sad Cat was for the safety of the team and their families,\" reads today's statement. \"As a result, part of the team has now relocated and work has only recently restarted on Replaced.\"\nDue to this, the publisher Coatsink, Thunderful, and developer all decided to move the release window to 2023. The team is continuing to work on Replaced, but says it is prioritizing the physical and mental health of its developers by not forcing the original deadline.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWkOcpZEk4I\nEnter the void\nReplaced does look pretty rad, with some incredible pixel art and style to it. But the decision to take a little more time for the studios' well-being is a good one, and a little extra time is a pittance compared to making sure the team at Sad Cat Studios is doing okay.\nThe war in Ukraine has had an effect on many of the game studios in the region. In response to the situation, many publishers and developers called for aid, to help those affected by the invasion. Recently, Epic and Microsoft teamed up to donate Fortnite proceeds towards various charities, ultimately raising $144 million in support.\nOther companies have also responded by removing their games from sale. CD Projekt halted sales in Russia and Belarus, and Electronic Arts removed the Russian national teams from several of its sports games.\nThe post Stylish indie Replaced has been delayed to 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

A collector's edition has also been announced, and will feature a statue of the three starters, a card set, pins, patches, and a collector's box.\nIf you've never played or heard of it before Jordan has a great writeup here, but suffice to say it's essentially a different take on the Pokemon formula. You play the role of a tamer [trainer], and attempt to catch creatures and battle them. The studio calls it a \"massive multiplayer creature-collection adventure.\"\n\nBilled as the \"1.0\" edition following a lengthy early access period, the story campaign involves \"six vivid islands,\" with a narrative involving the \"evil Clan Belsoto.\" Of course, there's chilling involved too, with activities like fishing and hanging around the open world. Unlike Pokemon, the team has embraced online play, and allows you to \"see other tamers around\" on the map and fight in co-op form. Player housing is in too, as well as outfit customization and competitive elements (which involves a round of bans and picks until you square off in a 5v5 format).\nNew stuff that's coming to Temtem 1.0 includes seasonal updates and a battle pass system, with free and premium tracks. There's also a \"final endgame island,\" which has new vendors, places to explore, and more battle opportunities. Quests will be updated \"weekly and regularly.\"\nWith the level of success this game has reached before 1.0, it stands to reason that it'll be supported for some time after Temtem is out in September.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfMsEm9K0cE\nThe post Pokemon-like Temtem is out in September on PC, Switch, PS5, and Xbox appeared first on Destructoid.",

As a five-star hydro archer, she'll join Kuki Shinobu (a four-star electro support) as the main gang of update 2.7. A \"drumalong rhythm game,\" a new Archon Quest taking place in the Chasm, and Xiao/Arataki Itto banner re-runs are on the menu come May 31, too.\nWhat I love about Genshin is how much variety there is when it comes to the cast. Anything is possible, from criminal underlords to magical girls, to stalwart shonen types.

Ford spoke about working on the new Indian Jones film and how it was nearing completion. \"I had a wonderful experience working with James Mangold,\" said Ford, according to a Tweet from Decider. \"I am really proud of the movie that we made.

          "description": "Star Wars Celebration began today with a panel showing with a showcase of the projects Lucasfilm is working on, and the new Star Wars series Andor had the spotlight after the cast of Obi-Wan Kenobi left the stage. Not only was there a brief interview with the show's cast and crew, but a teaser trailer debuted along with the release date on Disney+ of August 31.\nThe teaser trailer shown is musically paced with anvil-like percussion and throat-singing casting the theme of the footage. Focusing on the growing tension between the rebellious citizens and the overbearing Empire, Andor will depict the five years of Cassian Andor's life prior to the events of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. The trailer shows those citizens preparing for conflict with imperial forces while Diego Luna's Andor voices his displeasure with the Empire over the footage. We, of course, see Cassian Andor sneaking around, but also a new look at Genevieve O'Reilly returning as Mon Mothma, who last played this role in Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith. Peppered throughout are shots of a lush forest, a stark white base set in a body of water, and a large futuristic city that is most likely Coruscant.\n“We’re going to rewind 5 years back from #RogueOne. We’ve already shot 12 episodes!“ - Tony Gilroy #StarWarsCelebration #Andor\nMay 26, 2022\nThe opening panel for this year's Celebration wasn't streamed, but plenty of news has come from the panel via the Star Wars official Twitter account. Executive Producer Tony Gilroy said that 12 episodes of Andor have already been shot for the premiere this fall, and twelve more episodes will encompass a second season that will lead directly into the events of Rogue One.\nAndor will be streaming exclusively on Disney+, and its premiere on August 31 will include the first two episodes of the series.\n[Source: Decider]",

The wait to be reunited with them again, however, will be a little longer than expected. The Mandalorian's third season won't hit this year. The first episode is now officially slated to release in February 2023. \nThis news comes from the first day of Star Wars Celebration in Anaheim, Calif. The series' creators, Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni, took to the stage in front of a packed theater to deliver the update. Actor Rosario Dawson also appeared in full Jedi makeup from the set of Ahsoka to reveal it would also be hitting in 2023, but no month was given.\nFiloni and Favreau then surprised the crowd with the announcement of a new show called Star Wars: Skeleton Crew.

While you’ll be able to brave the cinematic horrors with friends in person on launch day, the game’s online play has been delayed.\nThe studio tweeted a message stating that it’s delaying The Quarry’s online multiplayer to no later than July 8. That’s roughly a month after the game’s June 10 launch. Supermassive explains the move was made to ensure the rest of the game, such as its single-player and local co-op, is as polished as possible by the release date.\nAn update on The Quarry's online multiplayer: pic.twitter.com/Bipo0yxp2g\nMay 26, 2022\nThe full statement reads as follows:\nWhile a bummer, one would assume Supermassive’s other option was to delay The Quarry entirely, and it chose what it deemed the lesser of two evils. The game stars a group of teenage summer camp counselors who find themselves hunted by dangerous locals and another mysterious threat. Like Until Dawn and the Dark Pictures Anthology, players are presented with a myriad of choices that cause the story to branch in several ways – so much so that The Quarry apparently has 186 unique endings. The Quarry stars an ensemble cast that features David Arquette, Lin Shaye, Ted Raimi, Ariel Winter, Brenda Song, Justice Smith, and others. \nThe Quarry will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Supermassive recently released footage of the game’s first 30 minutes that you can watch here.

Among his most memorable roles is Henry Hill in Goodfellas and Shoeless Joe Jackson in Field of Dreams. In recent years, Liotta has had a resurgence in Hollywood with roles in Marriage Story, the Amazon Prime series Hanna, and multiple other projects in the works, including a film called Cocaine Bear and a series called Blackbird, that will, unfortunately, see the light of day without him around. \nAlthough his impact on the film industry is great, Ray Liotta also made a profound statement in video games, starring as Tommy Vercetti in Rockstar Games' Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. At the time, having veteran Hollywood talent in video games was a novel concept, expanded upon in the years following due in part to Liotta's portrayal of Vercetti. Vice City was an instant hit when it was released in 2002, receiving many awards, including Game Informer's 2002 Game of the Year. It's sold over 17 million copies according to a Take Two earnings report from 2008.\nLiotta leaves behind his daughter, Karsen, and his fiancée, Jacy Nitollo.

You play the role of a seasoned dinosaur handler who wants to protect the dinosaurs. These efforts will pit you against poachers, mercenaries, and scientists looking to create deadly hybrids. This free-to-play action/adventure experience will release for iOS and Android devices soon.\nThe top-down gameplay pushes you to rescue and collect dinosaurs, and also use them for battle against other prehistoric beasts and hostile human forces. The dinosaurs can also be used to aid you in battle.  Pteranodons drop supply crates, and the Triceratops can ram through objects.\n“Jurassic World Primal Ops lets players immerse themselves in the Jurassic World franchise, allowing them to deepen their connection with dinosaurs in thrilling, new ways,” said Jim Molinets, SVP of Production at Universal Games and Digital Platforms. “The game is reflective of the brand’s signature storytelling, intense action, compelling environments, and diverse characters, and promises to be engaging for new and long-time fans alike.”\nThe game will feature in-app purchases and features many of the dinosaurs that will debut in Jurassic World Dominion, a movie slated to open in theaters on June 10. Check out the trailer above and the images below to see what awaits you in Primal Ops. If you are in the market for a dinosaurs experience right now, Jurassic World Evolution 2 is quite good and with over 70 dinosaurs to place and interact with within your own theme park.",

A mysterious tower has also appeared in the center of the island.\nEpic Games is encouraging streamers and players to record the event, as it won't be repeated.

The teaser image above gives us a taste of a monstrous return.\nIf you have the Battle Pass, you have just one week to complete it and get Doctor Strange (and his alternate costumes in the bonus tier). Fly through the missions you can for big XP bumps.\nIf you log in at any point on June 4 after 8 a.m. ET, you'll receive an exclusive loading screen and lobby track for Collision.

In Fall 2021, Sony CFO Hiroki Totoki outlined plans to invest more heavily in console semiconductor shortages linked to the pandemic. But according to Eurogamer, component scarcity isn't the only thing catalyzing the new-gen deficit. The Russia-Ukraine war has also affected part inventory. In a financial presentation conducted yesterday, Sony CEO Jim Ryan stated that PS4 sales continue to be higher than those of the PS5. However, the shortages are expected to stabilize and overtake PS4 sales by 2024. \nIn the image above, you can see the PS5 projections. In year one, the PS5 outsold the PS4, in year two, it undersold the PS4 due to supply constraints, in year three, the gap is expected to close, and by year four onwards, the PS5 is expected to overtake its predecessor again. This, of course, won't be easy. Sony has two plans to help expedite the gradual sale increase: source several suppliers for greater stability and facilitate logistical negotiations to maintain optimal delivery routes. \nMatt Miller awarded the PlayStation 5 an A- in his review of the console and stated:\n\"The PlayStation 5 is an incredibly powerful and sophisticated piece of gaming hardware, sometimes virtually eliminating the tedium of loading screens that have plagued console gaming for decades. Games look amazing thanks to new lighting techniques, especially on 4K displays, and a proprietary sound engine ensures an equally arresting aural experience. While its outward aesthetic is attractive, it's also overpowering, and the design won't please everyone. A slick dashboard is easy to use and smartly designed and values what's important to you, most especially your leisure time.\"\nHopefully, we'll all get our hands on the new-gen Sony console we deserve as we grow closer to a future where stronger hardware takes precedence.\n[Source: Eurogamer]",

After finding promising results in Trails From Zero, he brought the technique over to Ys IX. Lo and behold, there was an impressive frame rate boost with the same implementation, with a 25% increase in parts of the game where the CPU can bottleneck performance. The update proved stable enough in testing to push it live for everyone playing the Steam version.\nHere are the full patch notes fro…",

          "description": "Ni no Kuni: Cross Worlds is the sixth entry in Level-5’s beloved JRPG series. The MMORPG was released in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan last year but is finally available in North America on mobile devices and PC starting today. You can watch the animation trailer below. \n\n\nLike the main installments before it – namely, Wrath of the White Witch and Revenant Kingdom – Cross Worlds is composed by the legendary Joe Hisaishi and features Studio Ghibli-animated cutscenes. According to the Ni no Kuni website, the story is as follows: \n“You are about to enter a brand new world in the virtual reality game Soul Divers. But as you explore and become stronger, you’ll realize this world is not a virtual one. A mysterious girl named Rania entrusts you with a mission: Rebuild your kingdom ransacked by powerful foes  and save the two connected worlds from certain destruction!” \nFor all you anime fans out there, Cross World’s central narrative seems directly inspired by the isekai genre. The animation trailer above reveals that the new Ni no Kuni still brims with the whimsy and eccentricity that the franchise is known for. Moreover, the high-fantasy overtones and vivid art style make a welcome return. \nKim Wallace had lukewarm feelings on Wrath of the White Witch, but Joe Juba awarded Revenant Kingdom an 8 out of 10 and stated:\n“Ni no Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom may not nail everything it attempts, but it gets the important things right. Building your kingdom is satisfying and engaging, even with the weak narrative hooks. The cycle of rewards became an obsession, and had me staying up late to recruit just one more ally, or complete just one more upgrade. Combat could be tighter, and other supporting elements could use some polish – but like any kingdom, this experience isn’t about individual contributions. It’s about how those contributions come together, and the fun of this experience as a whole outweighs its flaws.”\n\n\nHopefully, Cross World will garner positive reception too.",

          "description": "After finding success on PC, 2D fighter Them’s Fightin’ Herds is making its way to consoles this fall.\nIf the game reminds you of My Little Pony, it should. Them’s Fightin’ Herds is a spiritual successor to Fighting is Magic, an unlicensed fighting game based on the popular My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic series created by fans of the show (who appropriately call themselves Mane6). A big “cease and desist” from Hasbro forced halted Fighting is Magic's launch, forcing Mane6 to rework the idea into an original title. However, Lauren Faust, the mastermind of Friendship Is Magic, admired the project and lent her artistic talents to design Them’s Fightin’ Herds’ colorful cast of four-legged combatants. \n\n\nThem’s Fightin’ Herds sports a streamlined 4-button fighting system complete with combos (and juggle decay), a magic system, and super attacks. Players can duke it out in local and online versus modes, and an episodic story mode modeled as a classic top-down RPG features side quests and boss fights. The experience also boasts cross-platform matchmaking, rollback netcode, a replay system to rewatch matches, and a dynamic soundtrack that changes based on the characters. The game has been positively received since launching on Steam in 2020 and has amassed a dedicated following, with organized tournaments taking place at events such as EVO. \nThe console reveal news also comes alongside the announcement of a Season 1 Pass that introduces four new fighters, additional stages, and cosmetics. This pass can be purchased separately and is included in a $39.99 Deluxe Edition of the game. Otherwise, the base game runs for $19.99. \nThem’s Fightin’ Herds will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Switch at an undisclosed date. Physical versions of the Deluxe Edition are in the works by Maximum Games Store, set to launch within the same timeframe. You can pre-order a copy here.",

Now, End Global 7 has revealed that it’s been canceled. \nThis news comes by way of Eurogamer, which first reported on End Global 7’s statement released today. In that statement, the company says it is re-evaluating things such as risk profiles, investments, and portfolio strategies and that development of Daybreak Games Marvel MMO has ceased as a result. \n“EG7 today announced it will be discontinuing the development of the Marvel project at Daybreak Games,” the statement reads. “Based on the re-evaluation of the development risk profile, size of investment, and the long-term product portfolio strategy for the group, the board has decided to change the development priorities and reallocate resources within the group to focus on alternative long-term projects.”\nEG7 had planned to invest more than SEK 500 million ($50.5 million) in the Marvel project over the next three years. The company will now instead “diversify” this investment across multiple smaller projects within the studio group. This includes previously announced upgrades to The Lord of the Rings Online and DC Universe Online, as well as “new game opportunities with our first party, original IPs.” \nIt sounds like EG7 has washed its hands of Marvel, or vice versa, to some extent as it does not seem a Marvel game is in the publisher’s future.

However, beyond that, Leviathan also introduces a roguelike experience to play through. \n\n\n“[Leviathan] is very different to anything we’ve done before,” a press release reads. “It is more roguellike, with players caught in a time-loop. Players start together on an expedition, and each time they die, they lose their progress, but help the community try to break free from this loop together.\n“Difficulty has been turned up in a vairety of ways, but every death means a reset of the loop and a new proc-gen loadout. To make it easier to complete the eventual goal of breaking out of the loop with just one life, the community can work together on a persistent, global goal that permanently improves the quality and frequency of upgrade rewards found during each loop.”\n\nThe story of Leviathan reveals itself as players work alongside Specialist Polo and the actual Leviathan, “a large and imposing space creature shrouded in myth and mystery.” Those who undertake this expedition can earn rewards like The Whalestalker cloak, a mini Organic Frigate for your base, a Temporal Starship Trail, and more. Hello Games says the ultimate reward, however, is the first ever living frigate – an imposing tentacled beast – which will be your very own Space Whale to add to your freighter fleet. \nYou can view the full patch notes for Leviathan here.\nAre you going to be checking out Leviathan today?

However, in just a few months, it will finally launch into 1.0 on consoles and PC. \nMore specifically, Temtem 1.0 will go live on Sep. 6 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. Temtem has already been available to play on PS5 and PC so today’s news in terms of platforms is that it’s coming to Xbox and Switch in September. To celebrate the news, developer Crema has released a new trailer showcasing what to expect in 1.0. \n\n\nThat includes a new endgame island and much more in-game. Pre-order links for Switch aren’t yet live, but on Xbox, there’s a standard edition you can pre-order and a deluxe edition. The latter includes “bonus cosmetic content (to be revealed at a later date) – available when Temtem launches.” If you prefer to buy your games physically, you can do that too because there will be both a standard physical edition of the game and a Temtem collector’s edition as well. \n“Crafted with care by Crema, Humble Games, and Final Boss Bundle, it contains a lovely diorama statue and a set of enamel pins of our oldest partners, the starters,” a press release reads. “Want to immerse yourself further into the world of Archipelago? It also includes a Temcard replica of fan-favorites Kinu, Gharunder, and Shuine, and a set of three irresistible embroidered patches that will make you feel like you’re part of the Narwhal Crew.”\nHowever, this bundle does not include the game. You can pre-order the collector’s edition, as well as additional Temtem merch, here.

          "description": "Hogwarts Legacy releases this holiday for multiple platforms, but PlayStation 5 players will experience additional technical magic thanks to the game’s suite of DualSense features.\nA PlayStation Blog post revealed the different ways Hogwarts Legacy takes advantage of the controller’s haptic feedback. For starters, spells sport individual physical button resistances and feedback to make them feel unique from one another. In a nice touch, these haptic effects are isolated to the right side of the controller to simulate wielding a wand in one hand more accurately. Hopefully, this feature can be flipped to the other side of the gamepad so that left-handed players can experience the same immersion. \n\n\nThe DualSense light bar displays various flash effects for each spell, but it also radiates the color of your chosen house. For the uninitiated, that’s red for Gryffindor, green for Slytherin, yellow for Hufflepuff, and blue for Ravenclaw. \nThe controller will also simulate sensations such as crushing botany ingredients in potions class, deflecting and disintegrating incoming magic using the shield spell Portico, and soaring the skies atop a broom or hippogriff. Hogwarts Legacy also leverages the PS5’s 3D audio to pick up smaller sound effects such as a crackling fireplace and other environmental sound cues.  \nTo learn more and watch additional video clips of these features in action, be sure to visit the PlayStation Blog post. Hogwarts Legacy doesn’t have a release date, but it’s slated to arrive sometime this holiday. You can play it on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. You can watch an extended gameplay demonstration in March’s State of Play video here.",

Ships...? The video in the tweet features a cargo ship? You’ll love the joke if you watch the clip. In the said video, there’s a reveal of many familiar faces from Task Force 141 showing up in Modern Warfare II. As the drone footage zips through the Port of Long Beach, the camera focuses on the sides of shipping containers displaying the portraits of Captain John Price, Simon “Ghost” Riley, John “Soap” MacTavish, Kyle ‘Gaz’ Garrick, and, according to the YouTube description for the video, the introduction of Mexican Special Forces Colonel Alejandro Vargas.\nFor a better look at the cast of Modern Warfare II, check out the gallery below.\n\nWhile we now know Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II “ships” on October 28, we don’t know much of anything about the setting, story, and multiplayer, and still don’t have any known platforms for its release. PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC are a shoo-in, but PlayStation 4 and Xbox One are likely, but questionable additions as we move forward in the console generation.",

The Switch version will arrive sometime later in the year.\n\n\nThe game was first announced in 2019 and was originally slated to arrive in 2021 before being delayed into this year. The story follows J.R.R. Tolkein’s books rather than Peter Jackson’s film trilogy, detailing Gollum’s happenings during the first chapters of The Fellowship of the Ring after he loses the One Ring to Bilbo Baggins. Gollum embarks on a journey across Middle-earth, visiting locations such as Mirkwood and Barad-dûr. \nGameplay-wise, Gollum is a stealth adventure game as players sneak around environments and can choose to avoid or engage enemies. The choice depends on if you indulge Gollum’s vicious nature or the more timid tendencies of his other personality, Smeagol. Climbing and platforming are also a big part of the experience as players can scale structures, adding verticality to exploration. \nWe last saw The Lord of the Rings: Gollum in action in 2021 during a hands-off preview demo. You can read our impressions of it from that time here.",

In the 16-bit sequel, Sonic had new moves and a two-tailed fox friend to aid him, but with those upgrades came more significant threats from the evil Dr. Robotnik. Sonic the Hedgehog 2 on Genesis was immediately regarded as a definite upgrade over the already strong first entry in the series. Similarly, Paramount's Sonic the Hedgehog 2 movie expands the universe established by its predecessor and delivers a better overall film thanks to bigger action setpieces, laugh-out-loud gags, and some terrific fanservice moments.\nWarning: While I try to remain as spoiler-free as possible, some aspects of the narrative and characters are mentioned thr…",

          "description": "Marvel Studios has released a new Thor: Love and Thunder trailer that runs more than two minutes long and features a ton of new footage, especially compared to the teaser trailer released last month. \nThe new trailer features extended looks at scenes from the teaser, like when Thor realizes Jane Foster is back and now wielding Mjolnir. It also contains new footage of Korg, the Guardians of the Galaxy, and the villain of Taika Waititi’s latest Thor film, Gorr the God Butcher.\n\n\nFor comic fans, one look at Christian Bale’s Gorr, and it’s immediately apparent that this is a very different take. Gorr is typically more alien-looking but still humanoid. Bale’s Gorr looks very much like a human, and it’s not surprising because if you’re going to hire someone like Bale to play a villain, why not squeeze out as much as you can by reminding folks that this is Bale. \nHowever, regardless of where you fall on “he’s too human” or “I like it,” it’s hard to disagree that Bale’s Gorr is appropriately metal. Right off the bat, Gorr the God Butcher is an incredible title to hold if you’re a villain. Couple that with his first announcement – that all gods need to die, including Thor – and his design, which features black-tipped fingers, a planet-shattering weapon, and a black liquid that runs out of his mouth, and Gorr might be the most metal MCU villain yet. \n\nFor more, watch the first Thor: Love and Thunder teaser trailer and then listen to this episode of From Panel To Podcast, which is Game Informer’s comic book podcast, to hear us talk about Thor: Love and Thunder. \nWhat did you think of this trailer?

Zynga is notable for its globally enjoyed small screen titles like Farmville and CSR Racing 2, the most popular mobile racing game. Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick voiced his company's excitement about the deal, stating:\n\"We are thrilled to complete our combination with Zynga, which is a pivotal step to increase exponentially our Net Bookings from mobile, the fastest-growing segment in interactive entertainment, while also providing us with substantial cost synergies and revenue opportunities. As we bring together our exceptional talent, exciting pipelines of games, and industry-leading technologies and capabilities, we believe that we can take our portfolio to another level of creativity, innovation, and quality.\"\nZynga CEO Frank Gibeau responded in kind, \"We are excited for Zynga's next-generation mobile platform, free-to-play expertise, diverse offering of games and incredible team to join the Take-Two family. We are eager to continue building an unparalleled portfolio of games that will reach broader markets and lead to continued growth for this next chapter of Zynga's history.\"\nPerhaps we'll see more mobile ports or versions of Take-Two titles in the coming years. This deal comes hot off of financial reports that revealed the launch of more than 69 Take-Two games over the next three years. Only time will tell what fruit is born of this monumental merger. Acquisition culture is growing in the games industry. Sony recently hired a Corporate Development Director to spearhead growth opportunities through acquisitions, and Microsoft's Phil Spencer reiterated Xbox's commitment to buying studios that are \"a good fit.\" \n[Source: PC Gamer]",

Picture an intergalactic bounty hunter with an attitude problem – that's basically Lobo. He first appeared in an Omega Men comic book in 1983, and after bouncing through dozens of DC comic book series for decades, finally made his live-action debut in an episode of Krypton. The point being: We need more Lobo.\nHe's a wild character who almost starred in his own video game in 1996. Ocean of America was hard at work on a fighting game starring Lobo for Super Nintendo and Genesis. As the fact sheets below show, the developer apparently had most of the gameplay details worked out. The canceled project included moves like \"Ram Grenade Down Throat,\" \"Blow Opponent in Half,\" and \"Fire Hole Through Opponent.\" The setup is what you would expect: Lobo must kill everyone who stands in his way. He even has to murder a clone of himself. Below are a number of fact sheets from Game Informer's archives that outline the project, and a gameplay video from a prototype.\nI doubt we'll ever see Lobo in a game, but there's a chance more DC characters like Wonder Woman will get their own projects.

Sonic fans clearly showed up, too, because not only did Sonic The Hedgehog 2 score the best opening weekend for any video game movie ever, but it’s also the highest-grossing video game movie of all time in the U.S. as well. \nIn the meantime, check out this story about the scrapped “Ugly Sonic” movie design that makes a cameo in Disney Plus’ new Chip ‘n Dale movie. \nHave you seen Sonic The Hedgehog 2?

          "description": "Fighting game fans and brawler fans rejoice! The mashup you’ve pictured in your head a hundred times – Street Fighter vs. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles – is becoming an action figure reality. That’s because Playmates Toys is releasing four SF vs TMNT character sets and two are coming later this year. \nThe four sets respectively are:\nRyu vs. Leonardo – the leaders face off\nChun-Li vs. Michelangelo – authority vs. exuberance\nGuile vs Raphael – strength vs. strength\nKen Masters vs. Donatello – restraint vs. intellect\n\nThe two releasing this fall are Ryu vs. Leonardo and Chun-Li vs Michelangelo, and it is then that they’ll hit retail shelves. Unfortunately, as you can see above, those are the only two sets with images so far. As for where, Playmates Toys doesn’t say in today’s news, but it’s likely they’ll end up where Playmates Toys figures are typically sold near you. \n“Each figure in the collection stands six inches tall and is highly poseable with multiple points of articulation – from ball joints at the head, shoulders and hips, to split joint elbows and knees, and at the wrist, ankles, upper arms, and thighs,” a press release reads. “Authentically detailed and decorated as seen in the Street Fighter II video game, Street Fighter vs. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is packed out in an ‘80s video game console-shaped window box packaging.” \nThis collection, which encompasses four SF vs. TMNT faceoffs, was created in celebration of Street Fighter’s 35th Anniversary, which is this year. \nWhat SF vs. TMNT matchups would you like to see?

In a new partnership with Warner Bros., Looney Tunes are coming to the high-octane toy racer in July.\nA brief teaser trailer shows off the ACME warehouse, and as the camera pans down, we hear the telltale sounds of the Roadrunner and Wile E. Coyote before they're seen giving chase in car form on a Hot Wheels track. The Looney Tunes Expansion contains five new Tune-flavored cars, a themed track builder module, themed profile and basement customization items, along with the Looney Tunes Adventure Park environment to cruise around. The Adventure Park features four environments with different themes, one of which being a desert area to recreate Roadrunner and Wile E. chases of your own.\nHot Wheels released a set of six physical Looney Tunes cars in 2017, with the two vehicles shown in the trailer among the group. The others not announced from that set include Bugs Bunny, Taz the Tazmanian Devil, Marvin the Martian, and Daffy Duck. If I were a betting man, I'd assume the other three cars will come from these remaining four collectibles as well.\nThe Looney Tunes Expansion will be available on July 14 and can be purchased as a piecemeal DLC for Hot Wheels Unleashed but is also tied to the upcoming Hot Wheels Pass vol. 3 (available for purchase on June 9), which includes more vehicles, customizations, and Track Builder Modules. For more on Hot Wheels Unleashed, read our review of the racer here, and for more Looney Tunes nonsense, check out our preview and videos of MultiVersus.",

          "description": "2D Action RPG Lost Epic is graduating from Steam Early Access and going 1.0 this July. The launch also brings the game to PlayStation platforms, marking the game’s first appearance on consoles. \nLost Epic first launched in Early Access in June 2021, and it blends Metroidvania-style exploration, Souls-inspired fast-paced combat, and a vibrant anime presentation. Players control a God Slayer on a quest to defeat a pantheon of divine gods threatening humanity. The hack ‘n slash combat encourages thoughtful combo-building and utilization of a parry mechanic to slay Lost Epic’s challenging enemies. God Slayers are fully customizable thanks to a deep skill tree, and you can craft enchantments and other items to bolster your arsenal. You can even tackle the campaign alongside friends in three-player online co-op. Check out the release date trailer below to see Lost Epic in action. \n\n\nBefore launch, Steam Early Access players can now enjoy a new update, Ver 1.3.0, that adds a new world: the Abyss. This patch adds new bosses and the Eyes of God item used to uncover additional unseen paths leading to the game’s final world. You can watch the video for that below. \n\n\nAt launch, Lost Epic receives a new world called the Sky Spire. The new area contains a powerful raid boss to tackle alone or alongside allies. Players can wield new weapons such as the Regalia blade, staff, shield, and new weapon enhancement materials. Lastly, characters from developer Team Earth Wars’ previous title, Earth’s Dawn, will become playable.  \nYou can play the final version of Lost Epic on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC on July 28. The developer also plans to raise the game's price at launch. The new price isn’t listed, but Lost Epic is $19.99 on Steam (though it’s currently discounted to $14.99 until May 27). That means you’ll want to grab it on PC now if you think the game is up your alley.",

          "description": "Sony unveiled its new and revamped PlayStation Plus service that combines Plus with PS Now back in March. Then, Sony revealed some of its PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, and classic games lineup, including a selection of PS1 games, that would be coming to the service. That list wasn’t exhaustive, though, and now, two more classic games have seemingly leaked, as reported by Eurogamer. \nFunnily enough, it appears to have been PlayStation itself that accidentally leaked the two new classic games – Oddworld: Abe’s Odyssey (PS1) and Ridge Racer 2 (PSP) – because fans found both listed on the Malaysian PSN store. At the time of this writing, the Abe’s Odyssey page is still up but the Ridge Racer 2 page takes you to a window that says “Not available for purchase” and nothing else. You can also view the Malaysian PSN’s listing of two previously announced PS1 games coming to PS Plus next month – Worms Armageddon and Worms World Party. \nAs Eurogamer notes, in the ResetEra post where these (seemingly) accidental leaks were first found by players, you can view multiple screenshots from the Ridge Racer 2 listing. \nOver on Video Games Chronicle, you can view nearly 10 minutes of Abe’s Odyssey in action, including a look at its emulation and how the rewind feature works.  \nWhile PlayStation has yet to officially confirm whether Abe’s Odyssey and Ridge Racer 2 are coming to PS Plus, it seems all but guaranteed. The Malaysian PSN page for Abe's Odyssey even shows “PS1 Emulation” in the title. While waiting to see if these two games hit the revamped PS Plus service here in the West, read Game Informer’s breakdown of all the games announced for PS Plus so far and then read about the three different PS Plus tiers to determine which one is the best for you.\n[Source: Eurogamer]\nAre you excited about these two games?

We're doing things differently this time as we're discussing the gameography of a developer rather than covering an individual game series. That studio is Supergiant Games, the acclaimed indie developer of Bastion, Transistor, Pyre, and Hades. This week, we conclude our season by analyzing 2020's Hades. \nUnlike Supergiant Games' previous titles, Hades had two release dates. Its first release came on December 6, 2018 when it launched in early access on PC, while the full game was available to be played on September 17, 2020. Hades takes everything the studio has learned up to this point and blends them into an ambitious rogue-lite that's developed in a way the team has never experienced before: with the gaming public playing the game as it's being made. Check out this episode to learn the backstory of how Pyre's large cast of characters inspired the evolving narrative of Zagreus and his dysfunctional diety family, how the studio fared developing an early access game, and learn all about Greek mythology from our guest, the incomparable Jill Grodt.\nJoin hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), John Carson (@John_Carson), along with Game Informer associate editor Jill Grodt (@Finruin) for a verbal stroll through the history and narrative of Hades!\nIf you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com.

Please note that the ScummVM version does have one obvious limitation, though.. the music used by the game is in a custom format we've been unable to properly support yet.

          "description": "A few days ago, Google announced the list of students accepted for this year's Google Summer of Code.\nWe are very proud to welcome 4 students this year who will be working on various parts of the project during the upcoming months.\nPragyansh Chaturvedi (aka Raikou) will work on improving our DIRECTOR engine. His effort will help us to allow support for many 90s-era adventure games made with the Macromedia Director authoring tools. By implementing more internal functions used by DIRECTOR, Pragyansh's main objective is to extend support for Meet Mediaband and The Journeyman Project (Win and Mac), making them fully playable without any glitches.\nMichael Hayman (aka Quote58) is about to implement support for The Immortal. The game (released in 1990) can be described as a mix of genres involving RPG elements with action and puzzles. Many changes across different game variants (written in pure assembly code!) will make this an interesting challenge. This project is a continuation of a GSoC task initially started by a former student back in 2018.\nEmanuele Grisenti (aka grisenti) will be working on a new engine, HPL1. The original sources for this engine got recently released by the original developer Frictional Games under GPLv3. The purpose of this project is to achieve a full port of this engine to ScummVM, with the goal of supporting the 2007 survival game Penumbra: Overture.\nAvijeet Maurya (aka StableSteady) will pick up several incomplete engines: MacVenture, Avalanche, Glk-Scott, Pink and WAGE. Some of these engines are very close to completion, but not quite there yet. The main objective of Avijeet's task is to identify all missing features and fix existing bugs. The goal for his project is to bring the above engines to a stable state.\nThe team is very excited about the upcoming weeks – and we hope you are as well.\nPlease give a warm welcome to our new students! Let's make GSoC 2022 a huge success – together!\n>",
