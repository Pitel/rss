          "description": "The long-awaited remaster of the remake.\nWay back in 1989, Nihon Falcom released Ys III: Wanderers from Ys for various PC-based platforms and eventually consoles like the Genesis and SNES. This 2D side-scroller was well-respected in the community and eventually acted as the basis for 2005's 3D reimagining, Ys: The Oath in Felghana, though this didn’t receive a Western release until a PSP version in 2010. Now, hot off the recent Western release of Ys X: Nordics, Falcom brings this remake to modern platforms as Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana. Sporting a few quality-of-life updates, this throwback to simpler times (which debuted in Japan back in September 2023) offers up an enjoyable and tightly designed action-RPG experience that you shouldn't miss out on.\nYs Memoire: The Oath in Felghana covers one of the earlier adventures of series star Adol Christin, following a journey to longtime companion Dogi's homeland of Felghana. They arrive and are warmly welcomed by Dogi’s friends and family, but it doesn’t take long for Adol to get caught up in a larger struggle. The king of Felghana seeks to claim a series of statues to loosen the seal placed upon a demon he wishes to release. Adol thus sets out to retrieve these statues before the king can, hoping to stop his nefarious plan.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Both games complement each other as flawed but enjoyable examples of Grasshopper Studios' beloved catalogue. An idiosyncratic collaboration between Suda 51 and filmmaker James Gunn, Lollipop Chainsaw highlights the unique style of both creators. It’s a hyper-stylised, quip-heavy action game that remains a uniquely demented experience. Sadly, content omissions and some choppy performance hamper this remaster, tainting the colourful mayhem.\nThe plot is both a perfect representation of its era and a great opportunity to experience Gunn in a goofy horror mode that was stifled when the MCU beckoned. On the morning of her eighteenth birthday, cheerleader Juliet Starling is inconvenienced by a zombie outbreak in her hometown. Luckily, Juliet comes from a long line of zombie hunters, the undead horde is no match for her skills with a chainsaw and a set of pom poms. Unable to save her boyfriend from a bite, Juliet decapitates him and carries his magically animated head on her belt. Together, they must battle through high school and defeat five musically themed dark lords, summoned by an angry goth kid named Swan to end the world.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "If you gotta go fast, you probably don't want to be a stubby-legged spearman who climbs every ladder like a geriatric walrus. Yet that's the challenge taken up yesterday by speedrunners at Awesome Games Done Quick. The UFO 50 speedrun includes an impressive dart through the retro collection's most bewildering game, the ancient and mysterious Barbuta, in which your character is a frustratingly slow hero with a fearfully short attack range. They managed to complete it in less than five minutes. Not only does the run (and its helpful commentary) serve as a short and sweet explanation of why Barbuta is so glitchily fascinating, it also left plenty of time to marathon another three games from the collection. \nRead more",

          "description": "Gentle reader, I have previously written exactly two boob-related articles in my life. One was a cheesy round-up of the best manboobs in video games for Green Man Gaming's long-vanished blog. It was published sometime in 2010, and IIRC, pre-reboot Kratos came out on top. I think/hope it still exists somewhere in the apparatus of Green Man Gaming, hidden beneath the retailer's veneer of respectability like a barrel of radioactive waste. The other boob article was a piece for OXM about Ken Levine saying that he wished people would stop fixating on Elizabeth's cleavage in Bioshock Infinite - a complaint we might consider slightly hypocritical, given the character's visual design.\nNow it's time for boob article number 3: some modder has given 122 of the 150 Jokers in cardgame Balatro big chests. This extends from visibly human Jokers to Joker concepts that shouldn't, strictly speaking, have the capacity for boobage. The banana card has boobs, for example. The credit card card has boobs. Behold.\n Read more",

Paradise is marketed as a third-person game set in a sunny modern city, where you can speak to any NPC via microphone on the street and get stilted responses powered by artificial intelligence. You will supposedly drive sports cars, shoot guns at people, and accrue in-game cash. But its more outlandish claims attracted immediate scrutiny from video creators who found countless inconsistencies in the marketing material. The game has since been removed from the Epic Games Store, presumably for breaking many of the store's rules. But it's still on Steam, and somehow clambering steadily up the wishlist ladder in defiance of its many red flags.\nRead more",

          "description": "I come and go with the work of Ken Levine, celebrated auteurman and reported burnout-inducing manager, but I'm interested to see more of Judas, his current project at Ghost Story Games. The concept for Judas is that you're trapped in a computer-run society housed aboard a colony ship, the Mayflower. The titular Judas has managed to break free of the AI-groomed status quo, and is out to start a revolution. \"Bioshock Infinite in space\", we called it, back in 2022, but Levine says it's more open-ended than either of his Bioshock endeavours, with a greater emphasis on other characters remembering and responding to your actions over time.\n Read more",

          "description": "I think the last time I read an actual, original Garfield comic was in 1998. Since then, my experience of the character has been one long litany of Gar-memes and in particular, Gorefield memes. For those blissfully unaware, Gorefield is a version of Jim Davis’s otiose, lasagna-loving housecat who has broken his comic strip shackles and become a cosmic abomination. Gorefield's manifestations are many: centipede Gorefields, arachnid Gorefields, Gorefields that extend serpentine necks of unfleshed bone towards a cowering Jon Arbuckle, demanding to be fed in a voice that sounds nothing like Bill Murray, a voice as deep and velvety as the eternal Monday before the Big Bang.\nIn Gar-Type, a free Gorefield fangame from Youtuber and pixel artist LumpyTouch, Garfield has become a planet. The good news is that, unlike many other Gore-variants, this Gorefield is vulnerable to bullets. It falls to ace pilot Jon Starbuckle and his prototype starfighter, Gar-Type D, to save the Earth from lasagnnihilation.\n Read more",

The project is called \"Artemis\" (at least for now) and you won't be seeing it any time soon. That's because the studio is still working on the tech behind it all, and plans to release two other games before it. Meaning it'll be 10-15 years before it actually comes out. \nGreene describes Artemis as an internet-like platform where users create and share things, but doesn't say specifically what those things might be. He doesn't know how his user-led \"multiverse of worlds\" will be moderated, or how it will prevent copyright infringement, or what makes this idea distinct from, say, Roblox.

Developer Lionel \"Seith\" Gallat and his team have been working on another helping of haunted mouseketeering since 2022. But this is the first time they've properly blogged about it, sharing details of a gruelling switchover to Unreal Engine 5 and a couple of new screens.

          "description": "I'm a sucker for a good first-person runabout. I don't need to shoot, but it's sometimes nice to get a sword, or a big whip. As long as I get to be immersed in an adventure. I think that's the big theme of my selection box: being grounded within my player character. I want to feel what it's like to hike through canyons with too much sellable loot in my backpack. I want to park my soul in the head of a scared Scotsman way out of his depth, hundreds of miles from shore. The closer I can comfortably fit in my character's shoes, the more I seem to buy into the world they inhabit. Even if that world is constantly glowing a magnificent crimson. \nRead more",

          "description": "My selection box isn't really a selection box. It's a tray of barely-nibbled leftovers, hastily lifted from my Steam backlog. One of the disadvantages of being news editor, you see, is that I have  developed a goldfish-grade attention span. In my hectic pursuit of the next scoop, or the next Elden Ring update changelog, I snatch and cast aside game demos like a pickpocket speedrunning the checkout line at Harvey Nichols. I'm dimly aware that some of these cast-aside games are Very Good. A few might even deserve to be played for longer than 30 minutes. I feel immensely guilty about that. Perhaps a little... existential, too. I have measured out my life in tutorial levels. \r\n\n\r\nSo! Rather than digging out three of the games I've actually completed this year, such as The Crush House, Death Of A Wish and Mask Quest, I'm going to gamble on recommending a few I've barely scratched, but which sure feel excellent and have attracted a positive critical consensus. If I am false in this assessment, may Horace the Endless Bear bite my head off for my impudence. Let's begin.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Instead, I want to talk about mini PCs – not just small-form-factor desktops, but properly tiny, box o’ chocolates-sized computers – which have, of course, been around for decades.\nRecently, however, I’ve been wondering if mini PCs are finally on the cusp of having their moment as serious games machines. Between rising desktop component prices and ever-ballooning electricity bills, it would make sense that a smaller, cheaper system would take on a new appeal, and the success of handhelds like the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally show that convenience still trumps out-and-out performance for a lot of PC players. There have even been hints that Valve are resurrecting their Steam Machine mini PC concept, years after a flopping first attempt. Should you be interested?\nRead more",

Its structure most resembles Songs of Conquest or Heroes of Might and/or Magic, but with little RPG emphasis or base building, and minimal tactical fighting.\nTaxonomy is arbitrary and often unimportant at the end of the day, but I am very glad to firmly rule it out of one category: It's not a bloody card game. It looks like one, sure. You do most things with cards, and characters acquire more cards over time.

My weakest skeletons, sensing their death coming, explode into fire and shards. My strongest skeletons fight so hard and with such alacrity that upon dying, they drag their spirits together and keep fighting as ghosts for a while. Foul little bone scorpions skitter around on fans of legs made from human hands. Somewhere in the middle, almost invisible among the noise, is the character I am actually playing: Path of Exile 2’s mean-spirited, callous, and gleefully enjoyable Witch.\nThis is a review in progress. It has to be. Even in its incomplete early access period, Path of Exile 2 is a great sprawling mass of a game. Three meaty acts of a planned six act campaign are followed by a trickier return tour through them, before the absurd endgame kicks into gear and the real work begins. If I came to you having played everything on offer I would be wild-haired, bloodshot-eyed and possessing perfect, incomprehensible knowledge. Let’s compromise: I have toured the dark caverns and the antediluvian crypts. I have been killed by various accumulated nasties. I’ve had a great time.\nRead more",

          "description": "The announcement of The Witcher 4 with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt's Ciri as protagonist has attracted a bit of discussion. Some of the reaction is online toddlers waxing wroth about a video game having a (somewhat older!!!) woman as lead character, and especially, shock, a video game in a series that has hitherto starred a man. And some of it is people commenting more thoughtfully on whether Ciri genuinely makes for a suitable Witcher protagonist, given that she isn't the product of the typical Witcher genetic modification regime (which is heavily tailored towards men), and given that, without spoiling too much, she has gifts that make crumbly old Geralt's sword-and-sorcery skillset look rather paltry. \r\n\n\nSpeaking to Eurogamer this week, game director Sebastian Kalemba and narrative director Philipp Weber responded to a few of these comments, and also shared a little about Ciri's situation at the start of the game.\r\n \nRead more",

Later, I examined the senator's personal history more thoroughly and discovered he was \"hated by bears for cooking them a rancid meal.\" I suppose every politician has their enemies. \nThat Caves Of Qud creates fun anecdotes out of simple encounters shouldn't be a surprise. It has had 15 years of early access to establish itself as a small-but-mighty story generating roguelike of repute (there's a reason it sits deservedly side-by-side with Dwarf Fortress in the same publishing house). After creating many characters, and dying and dying and dying again, I understand why it grips the brain with such fierce glee. It is a machine of grand imagination and adventuresome comedy. A deceptively powerful RPG that isn't half as obtuse to newcomers as the screenshots make it out to be. Qud's low-res bark is just a complement to its bite.\nRead more",

          "description": "Times Of Progress is a special game for me, because it's the first news tip I have ever received from Sin Vega, Prime Minister of Strategy Gaming. Sin once described writing news articles for our former news editor Alice0 (RPS in peace) as like practising backflips in front of the kung fu master. Writing about a new city builder at Sin's suggestion is like being invited to budget the development of Londinium by Julius Caesar.\nThe terror of screwing it up - together with other, more trivial distractions, like international games industry conferences - has stopped me from writing about Times Of Progress for months. Today I bite the bullet, and emerge from my lodgings to issue a hesitant speech to the masses, hoping like hell that Caesar is too preoccupied with the latest Gaul uprising to notice my errors.\r\n \nRead more",

Your job is to disassemble toys - five in all - according to his eldritch written instructions, and either \"salvage\" them or \"sentence\" them to the incinerator.\n Read more",

          "description": "Long before the likes of Oblivion, I recall the OG PlayStation console. Its 3D capabilities and catalog of releases turned Sony into a powerhouse in the video games industry. Nostalgic though that time was, we have truly moved on since those low-poly, low-pixel days. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't return to them every so often.\n\n\nThat's exactly what Nexus Mods user gong has done. Making sure we never forget the PS1 era of gaming, they've managed to \"demake\" The Elder Scrolls 4, turning it into a blocky facsimile of its formerly smooth (though now dated) self.\n\n\nImage via gong/Nexus Mods.\n\n\n\"Oblivion Umastered,\" as it's called, has taken the classic Bethesda RPG and \"decimally crunched\" the textures, turning it into something that would sit more at home in 1995. The modder has also – if you'll pardon the language – \"rampantly polyfucked\" the meshes, and has also \"bit crushed\" the audio. I speak for myself, but I kind of like the way gong describes things...\n\n\nObliviating the visuals\n\n\nVisually and audibly, it may have been altered to an eye-bleeding quality that many of us still recall fondly, but it's the same ol' Oblivion. The modder describes it as being like a PS1-era game, but it's functionally still TES4, so nothing else has been tinkered with outside the graphics and sound.\n\n\nThey also recommend running their unmastered mod with the included shader preset, saying that it's \"actually a pretty cool experience.\" All I can say is it really makes me miss my youth.\n\n\nOf course, we can't talk about The Elder Scrolls without mentioning the elusive sixth entry. Skyrim came out over 13 years ago and while Bethesda is working on the next game, many of us are starting to grow impatient. On top of that, there are still rumors that Oblivion will be getting a remake at some point. Counter that with this PS1 demake mod and we could potentially have it all from the nearly 18-year-old RPG.\n\nThe post Turn Oblivion into a PS1-style game with this mod appeared first on Destructoid.",

As revealed during Sony's CES press conference this week, the next season is officially set to kick off this April. \n\n\nLike the first, the second season will be airing on HBO and streaming on Max. Co-creator, writer, and executive producer Neil Druckmann reiterated that this season will run for seven episodes, which we previously learned about back in June 2024. Along with this news, we got a nice minute-long teaser offering up a look at the next set of episodes.\n\n\n\n\nThe season 2 logline paves the way for an adaptation of The Last of Us Part II. Set five years after the first season's events, Joel and Ellie have to deal with interpersonal conflict and \"a world even more dangerous and unpredictable than the one they left behind.\" \n\n\nIt's been two years since The Last of Us started its nine-episode run on HBO. In the time since its conclusion, we've been reacquainted with the returning cast and introduced to a few of the newcomers. In addition to Pedro Pascal as Joel and Bella Ramsey as Ellie, we'll see more of Gabriel Luna's Tommy and Rutina Wesley's Maria in season 2. As for the newcomers, here's an overview of some of the previously announced cast additions:\n\n\nNew to The Last of Us Season 2 Cast\n\n\n\nKaitlyn Dever as Abby\n\n\nIsabela Merced as Dina\n\n\nYoung Mazino as Jesse\n\n\nAriela Barer as Mel\n\n\nTati Gabrielle as Nora\n\n\nSpencer Lord as Owen\n\n\nDanny Ramirez as Manny\n\n\nJeffrey Wright as Isaac\n\n\nCatherine O'Hara (guest star)\n\n\n\nThe first season of The Last of Us was intense, but anyone who has played The Last of Us Part II is no doubt eager to see how they handle some of the darker turns.

A new style changes the way you play, and they have unique abilities as well. But to use them, you'll have to obtain them first inside the game. Let's take a look at how you can obtain the Nagi and Isagi styles in Blue Lock Rivals.\n\n\nHow to get Nagi Style in Blue Lock Rivals\n\n\nTo get the Nagi Style, you'll have to rely on luck. You will have to try and pull it out of a spin, but the job won't be easy. Being a Legendary Style, the odds of obtaining it will be as low as 2 percent. There are three Legendary Styles, so the odds of getting the Nagi Style are actually approximately 0.67 percent. You can always try your luck with the Premium Lucky Spins, which will raise the chance to 15 percent.\n\n\nNaturally, it will be an expensive process, and you'll need a lot of spins (unless you get to be super lucky with your pulls).\n\n\n\n\nHow to get the Isagi Style in Blue Lock Rivals\n\n\nThe process of obtaining the Isagi Style is the same, and you'll have to hope to get lucky from your spins. However, the Isagi Style is a Rare Style, which raises the odds to 62.5%. There are 2 Rare Styles in the draw, which puts the odds for the Isagi Style at 31.25%. Compared to the Nagi Style, this is a massively improved number, making it quite possible for you to obtain it.\n\n\nDo note that the Isagi Style can't be obtained from Premium Lucky Spins. Once again, you can always get more spins by using different codes or just by buying them directly via microtransactions in Blue Lock Rivals.\n\nThe post How to get the Nagi and Isagi Styles in Blue Lock Rivals appeared first on Destructoid.",

One resource you’ll need if you’re wanting to increase your friendship level with Maui is Worms, but they’re only available for a limited time. \n\n\nWorms are required to complete Maui’s level 2 friendship quest “Burying the Eel”. The worms will eventually be used as bait in a Fishing Trap, but before you can place it down in the water, you need to locate the worms and craft the Trap itself. \n\n\nHow to find worms in Disney Dreamlight Valley\n\n\nImage by Destructoid\n\n\nWhile you could be forgiven for thinking that the worms needed for this quest will be found on Dazzle Beach, this is not the case.

You’ll find some shiny, glittering spots that can be dug up using the Royal Shovel to provide you with Worms. \n\n\nRemember, these spots are only available to dig once you’ve reached friendship level 2 with Maui. \n\n\nHow to use Worms in Disney Dreamlight Valley\n\n\nImage by Destructoid\n\n\nOnce you’ve got your hands on the wriggly little Worms, you can progress through the “Burying the Eel” quest by using them to craft a Fishing Trap.

Sony has just announced that there's a Helldivers film in production, alongside an adaptation of Horizon: Zero Dawn.\n\n\nYou read that right: Sony Pictures is now working on an honest-to-goodness Helldivers film, as shared by none other than Geoff Keighley on Twitter. Further, IGN has reported on an upcoming collaboration between PlayStation Studios and Columbia Pictures to produce a re-telling of Horizon: Zero Dawn, which is in a category all of its own. These announcements kind of overshadowed the smaller one that Crunchyroll will host the upcoming Ghost of Tsushima anime, which is set to release sometime in 2027.…",

Even if you're managing your Nightclub efficiently, having a celebrity appearance is always going to be beneficial. There is an essence of RNG as you can't predetermine which celebrity will appear.\n\n\nNevertheless, they're almost always beneficial for your business, and let's take a look at how to attract the in-game celebrities to your joint.\n\n\nHow to make a celebrity appear in your GTA Online nightclub\n\n\nTo attract your celebrities, you'll need to complete certain promotion missions. Go to your Nightclub and login to your PC (in-game) to find Nightclub Management. From there, select \"Promote\", and you'll begin your promotion mission.\n\n\n\nOnce the mission has begun, step outside, and you'll find your escort vehicle. Once you enter the vehicle, a timer will begin.\n\n\nThe next job is to reach the next objective but try to avoid damaging the vehicle too much. Especially make sure that you don't end up mowing down the celebrity because that's not going to look too good.\n\n\nAfter picking up the celebrity, you'll have to lose the paparazzi. They will be marked on the mini-map, so try and avoid them as much as you can.\n\n\nAfter successfully managing to do the last task, you'll have to pick up another personnel for the celebrity.\n\n\nOnce done, you'll have to drop off the celebrity at your Nightclub. Once they have headed inside and spent some time, you'll get a message about the bonus.\n\n\n\n\n\nDo remember that you can have only one celebrity per night. It's not a mandatory thing to do, but it's always a welcome way to boost your Nightclub's finances.\n\nThe post How to get Celebrity Apperances in GTA Online appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Ho, ho, ho, Santa is in town. And he’s brought a gift with him. Here’s a shiny new package for you to unwrap, containing the first beta version of the upcoming OpenTTD 15 release. It comes faster, with road waypoints, fewer passwords, better scenario editor, and hopefully with a lot less bugs. To be a bit less vague, here are some of the highlights: Improved picker windows for stations/waypoints/objects/and more. Oh, and that does include road waypoints. Better perfomance in various places, including faster path signals that are now green by default. Password-less network authentication using keys. Several improvements for NewGRFs regarding cargo support. Better scenario editor with a town data importer and manual house placement. A large tree fully hung with ornamental bugfixes. Sadly though, not everbody was good this year. The old NPF pathfinder was finally retired, after YAPF being the superior default for many, many years now. There’s a lot of bugs left for you to find, though, guaranteed. Enjoy the beta, test all the things and report anything you find amiss, to make OpenTTD 15 the best OpenTTD 15 ever.
