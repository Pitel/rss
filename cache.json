At the end of every event, the show hands out awards to all eligible games that are present at the Cologne-based expo. One of these categories is the 'Best Nintendo Game', which has been around since 2012. However, the award won't be handed out this year as the organisers have scrapped the award for 2024.\nTheGamer, who reported on the story, reached out to Gamescom's organisers about the decision to scrap the award, and their response revealed that there were \"too few submissions\" for the category. Here's the brief statement in full:\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "\"Flying used to be fun until I started doing it for a living\".\nKiki’s Delivery Service is a movie all about growing up. The night Kiki leaves home to complete a year of witch training, she excitedly overstuffs her bag, makes herself a broomstick that’s too small for her, and crashes into a couple of trees during her flight. She doesn’t have a speciality or skill, and upon arriving in the town of Koriko, she causes a ruckus by stopping traffic. Yet this all serves to set up Kiki’s growth, and the pain of becoming an adolescent and – eventually – an adult. She finds her place in the world, living above a bakery, delivering goods on her broomstick, and overcomes her fears to become the best version of herself.\nKiki is the heart of Studio Ghibli’s 1989 coming-of-age story, and it’s her brashness, positivity, and determination that has clearly rubbed off on Mika, the star of Chibig’s latest game, Mika and the Witch’s Mountain. There’s no greater influence here than the aforementioned movie; the premise of playing a witch delivery game with cel-shaded visuals and sprawling seas inspired by The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker was enough to smash through its Kickstarter goal. Yet, two years after the potion was brewed, we’re left with a game that has flashes of the heart of the Studio Ghibli classic, but is sadly completely forgettable in almost every single respect.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

By that metric, it's the platform's most popular strictly single player game of all the time.\nAll that goodwill has been spoiled, however, by a Steam code handout message to streamers and other \"content creators\" before launch which includes some reactionary, non-binding requests - no mention of \"trigger words\" like \"Covid-19\", no talk of \"politics\" or \"feminist propaganda\", and no mention of \"China's game industry policies, opinions, news, etc\". \n Read more",

          "description": "Tactical Breach Wizards is a tactics game for people that don’t like tactics games. Magically, it’s also a tactics game for people who love them like nothing else. It’s permissive and demanding; playful and tense. Its globe-spanning plot covers conspiracies, PMCs, and brutal theocratic dictatorships. It also features a traffic-summoning warlock named Steve wearing a hi-vis robe. It’s finding that one absolutely, perfectly ridiculous XCOM turn, every turn…and at the same time knowing it’s absolutely, perfectly fine if you don’t. In short: it’s one of the most enjoyable tactics games I’ve ever played, and the only tactics game with a pyromancer so rubbish he relies on making his enemies pass out from heatstroke.\nRead more",

          "description": "Please lock your Chocobos to attack position and set your Phoenix Downs to stun: Square Enix have released fresh details of Final Fantasy 16's PC port, which has now been dated for launch on 17th September. They've also shared a little about why it's taken so long to arrive - the (generally decent) action-RPG hit PS5 over a year ago, back when I was still some filthy console-playing freelancer.\nAccording to director Hiroshi Takai, it was \"impossible\" to create the PC and PS5 versions at the same time, even if Square Enix hadn't been restrained by a timed exclusivity clause. He also thinks that the Final Fantasy series faces no \"existential risk\" right now, despite lower-than-hoped returns from both Final Fantasy 16 and, going by Square Enix's latest financial reports, the more recent and currently PS5-only Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.\n Read more",

          "description": "Silent Hill has a messy, up-is-down relationship with time and history, so let's go about this hands-on with the Silent Hill 2 Remake in a messy, up-is-down way. Developed well over two decades ago, the original Silent Hill 2 is the magnum opus of Polish horror stalwarts Bloober Team. Running on then-innovative \"Unreal Engine 5\" technology created by Jazz Jackrabbit publishers Epic MegaGames, it's a wonderful abyss of a game that remains perfectly playable today, given a certain amount of tolerance for the quirks of the era.\nIt begins with your character, James Sunderland, descending from the road towards the eponymous Midwestern nowhere-town. Like many games of the period, Silent Hill 2 uses a third-person, over-the-shoulder manual camera, which allows you to glance fearfully up at the monstrous pine trees that fringe the path - each rising from a bulging tide of fog that menaces with the suggestion of approaching figures. There is moisture everywhere, gushing from drain pipes and dribbling down concrete barriers. As you amble into the murk, deathly chords and groaning, unmechanical motifs reverberate from somewhere deep underground. \r\n \nRead more",

The 2022 version of Modern Warfare 2 lacked the original’s multiplayer, and H2M was so highly-anticipated that Steam sales of the 2016 FPS balooned in the lead-up to the mod’s planned release date. It didn't hurt that Activision had it on sale, of course, but the timing lined up so well that some fans speculated the discount was a deliberate bait-and-switch on the publisher’s part to profit from excitement over a mod they were already planning to shut down.\nRead more",

          "description": "When Bloober and Konami announced that they were remaking Silent Hill 2 as part of a comprehensive series reboot, it made immediate if slightly deflating sense to me. Silent Hill 2 is the more feted of the Hills - if I were a calculating franchise custodian tasked with 'bringing back' one of the acclaimed original trilogy, that's probably the instalment I and my spreadsheets would fix upon. I mean, it's the game with Pyramid Head in it - the nearest thing Silent Hill has to a mascot, and it's not like there's an issue of cutting out plot material: each game in the Silent Hill series is, on some level, a distinct story with a distinct protagonist.\nStill, the decision to 'skip' the first game in the series, whose world, narrative themes, music and art direction set the parameters for all the rest, made my brain itch a bit, and when I ran into Bloober's creative director Mateusz Lenart and lead producer Maciej Głomb at a Konami event, I had to ask about it. \r\n \nRead more",

The strategy game’s 5.2 update is on the horizon, and tagging along with it are the first of the “extra bits” the team teased in June. I’m very excited about them. They sit somewhere between the usual patch fare of stat tweaks and errata, and the weightier faction facelifts that come alongside paid DLC. They’re also focused right where Immortal Empires needs them the most: depth, rather than width. In the dawi’s case, quite literally.\n \nRead more",

What a perfect time, then, to dive into the alpha demo for vampire management game Blood Bar Tycoon, especially since Two Point seem to be resting on their laurels a bit too comfortably for my liking.\nThe idea here is you build a swanky bar serving claret cosmopolitans, ichor-ish coffees and uh, viscera vampiros to your undead clientele. But (with the sorta exception of the crimson-sapped Dracaena cinnabari) blood doesn’t grow on trees, so you’ll also be moonlighting as a human-nabber. You’ll research a slew of “whacky contraptions” to extract their blood, which I greatly enjoy, because “zany exsanguination” is a real winner of a feature.

Multiplayer shooty Helldivers 2 is still sitting around 35,000 concurrent players, which is perfectly respectable, if only around 10% of its peak back in April. Still, a clutch of disgruntled ‘divers have recently found a novel way to protest an increasingly unpopular series of nerfs: laying down their guns and letting the bots take the damn planet.\n“If Super Earth wanted to remain safe, they would stop nerfing our guns,\" reads one comment on the subreddit, in response to a post titled “Let the bots advance. Let the Super Earth burn.” It seems to have picked up some steam inside the actual game, too. As of earlier this week, there’s only around a thousand players actively trying to stop the bots advancing perilously close to the home planet, via Gamesradar.\nWhether this is all massively overblown for the sake of a dramatic yarn or not, Arrowhead themselves have taken note of player concerns over nerfs. Yesterday, game director Mikael Eriksson unveiled a plan for the next 60 days, directly addressing player feedback over the controversial ‘Escalation of Freedom’ update.\n \nRead more",

The Deck’s compatibility issues aren’t nearly as issue-some as they were at launch, but between its Linux-based SteamOS and its relatively mild processing power, but it is true that beefier Windows handhelds will more likely cater to your entire cross-launcher library.\nUnless, that is, you get something else to run them for you. Streaming games on the Steam Deck has emerged as a nifty workaround for the portable PC’s lingering compatibility woes, making even officially unsupported games playable. Usually with much better performance, too, as the actual rendering work is done remotely – what you see on the Deck’s screen is basically a video feed of that remote device’s display output, with your control input beamed the other way via a low-latency connection. And because you’re not using SteamOS or the internal hardware to actually run the game, it’s not bound by their limits.\nRead more",

          "description": "Among the many, Gigery beauties of 2014's Alien: Isolation is that you save using an in-game, wall-mounted Emergency Phone - a maddeningly analog process of slotting a keycard into the machine and waiting for three beeps. Doing this requires you to stand upright in full view, with your back turned upon an entire space station's worth of shiny domed technology and guttural industrial noises. Delightful!\nAmongst the players harrowed and compelled by this fixture is Fede Álvarez, director of the 2013 Evil Dead remake, 2016's Don't Breathe and, most recently Alien: Romulus - the seventh and avowedly \"back to basics\" Alien movie. Isolation is the Alien experience that convinced Álvarez the Alien could still be scary, after decades of milking the creature's dugs for spin-off movies and making it share a screen with the Predator, the Pepsi Max to Alien's Dom Pérignon 1921. In possibly self-defeating homage to Creative Assembly's work, he's filled the movie with Emergency Telephones, turning them into a straightforward-sounding form of foreshadowing.\n Read more",

Abiotic Factor is the courageous game that has been correcting this historic oversight. It's fun, and the fun just got funnerer. The \"Crush Depth\" update, released yesterday, adds a heap of new areas to the game's messed-up scientific facility, including a dangerous Security Sector and a vast reservoir zone called the Hydroplant. On top of that there are new weapons, tools, workbenches, drivable vehicles, fishing rods, and quite a bit more. It's all shown off in the trailer below.\nRead more",

One of these new features is a built-in browser for mods, and support for many existing mods that previously required a different version of the game. Basically, lots of good fan-made mods are now playable on the Steam version of ye olde Doom. That's neat! Ah, but there is some demon excrement on the health pack, so to speak. The mod browser lacks moderation and lets people upload the work of others with their own name pinned as the author.

A merry old time was had, romping through fortress cities like a small herd of crusader buffalo, using the game's absurd jetpack functionality to pancake invading Tyranids, and getting our screens so slathered in gore we couldn't work out who was killing what.\nIt looks like the gargantuan action game's PvP multiplayer will be even messier. Saber and Focus Home have released an extended trailer that walks you through two major modes - the PvE boss and wave-slaying frenzy of Operations, and the 12-player PvP carnage of Eternal War, which spans a range of match types. The ecstasy of dying for the Emperor aside, both give me frightful flashbacks to the early days of Gears Of War.\n Read more",

In that time, many other survival games have sprouted, blossomed, and gently faded away. I first visited the burnt-out ruins of this zombie-infested world a decade ago and I returned to it this week to find a tree-puncher that, despite bearing the pockmarks of early access, retains much of what made it enjoyable back when the survival genre was still wearing its baby onesie. Instead of a review, I figured I'd scribble together a mini starter guide for new (or returning) players. Partly because the game is a proper time sink and it was taking me so long to get through everything. But mostly because I wanted to use that numberful headline.

It's scrappy too in that it's, well. It's Stalingrad. Not really: its world is so fictional it's their 15th century. But the invaders are explicitly fascists and the defenders communists embroiled in a long and brutal semi-guerrilla city war with World War 2 technology. Thankfully, it's stripped of any actual fashy or genocidal play-acting beyond each side doing \"hail the empire/union\" bits as a sign off.\nI think that's why, despite its brutal and difficult setting, it's this year's entry in the long tradition of Low-Intensity Strategy Games For When Hot Why Hot Please Stop You Cannot See My Begging Tears For They Evaporate.\nRead more",

          "description": "UK arts and entertainment union Equity have unveiled a raft of \"best practice guidelines\" for video game developers hiring voice actors, including some suggested minimum rates that are designed to address \"systemic low pay\" for performers. Other measures are designed to improve voice actor working conditions, and stop companies using their voices and likeness as fuel for generative AI tools without their consent. It's both a praiseworthy endeavour and an interesting breakdown of the voice-actor's trade.\n Read more",

This is not the murmuring of some poor sod on a nineteen-hour Dota 2 binge who’s started thinking that the crumbs in his keyboard resemble a viable snack, but a bold new reality, one I recently found myself staring down during a trip to Asda. The supermarket chain – third biggest in the UK by turnover and purveyors of ill-fitting clothes and surprisingly good doughnuts alike – has added light-up gaming mice, keyboards, and headsets to its mountain of own-brand wares.\nAsda being what it is (Americans, if you’re unfamiliar, think Walmart with less gun violence), it’s all dirt cheap as well. £17 for a full-size keyboard. £16 for an FPS mouse. Overwhelmed with curiosity, I ended up taking home a complete starter set (keeb, different mouse, headset, and mousemat) for £45, or about a third of the price of the Logitech G515 Lightspeed TKL that I’d shortly kick off my desk. Could this be a new frontier in affordable PC hardware, bringing tech to the masses in a way no specialist retailer ever could, or should supermarkets stick to cereal and meal deals? Surely the Asda Tech (real name) 4-in-1 Gaming Kit would have the answers.\nRead more",

As of the game’s latest hotfix blog, we’ve now got a better idea when we’ll start seeing some of these “smaller bits and pieces.” Bits and pieces? In this economy?

          "description": "Back in February 2024, Supermarket Simulator released into Early Access and, surprisingly, took the gaming world by storm. For a while, you couldn’t escape playthroughs on streaming platforms and everyone seemed to be talking about it. \n\n\nSince then, Supermarket Simulator has had a lot of patches and the most recent one on August 20 is a game changer in many ways, but mainly because it finally adds full controller support to the game. However, this massive change isn’t the only useful thing to be added.\n\n\nImage via Nokta Games\n\n\nWhat’s the most useful thing in any grocery store? No, it’s not the price tags (although admittedly they are pretty useful), it’s the aisle signs. Patch v0.2.1 finally gives you the glorious ability to label your aisles and not only does this add a layer of realism into your store, but also allows you to remember where things go when stock levels plummet. \n\n\nAs well as this, we’ve finally been blessed with self checkouts. Say what you like about them, they’re definitely cheaper to run than hiring cashiers and they also free up a lot of floor space for more stock, increasing not only your range of stock, but also your profit margins. \n\n\nImage via Nokta Games\n\n\nAnd last, but definitely not least, we’ve now got a whole new bunch of store customization options on top of those already added in the previous customization update back in June. Patch v0.2.1 brings even more choices for the exterior appearance of your store, so you can really make it your own. \n\n\nImage via Nokta Games\n\n\nThere were other small additions in this patch, including further Restocker options and speakers which will pump music into your store, as well as minor bug fixes. Sadly, the bugbear of only being able to move stock in boxes which are considered to be the ‘right’ size is still in existence, but we can’t have everything. \n\nThe post Supermarket Simulator patch v0.2.1 adds further customization options and full controller support appeared first on Destructoid.",

But first, you need Tea Leaves. \n\n\nHow to make or buy Tea in Fields of Mistria\n\n\nTo get Tea in Fields of Mistria, you’ve got a couple of choices, but neither of them can happen before you’ve upgraded the General Store and unlocked the full variety of seeds on offer. After doing this, not only will you be able to purchase Tea Seeds for 300 Tesserae from the General Store itself, but you’ll also be able to purchase grown Tea at Balor’s Wagon for 400 Tesserae as long as it is in stock. \n\n\nIf you choose to grow your own Tea, you’ll need to plant it in the Summer, and it will take five days to reach maturity before going on to produce one Tea per plant every three days.

          "description": "In the roster of annual events in Final Fantasy XIV, few come with such heartwarming stories as The Rising. Every year in August, director and producer Naoki Yoshida appears as an in-game character to express his thanks for continued support, along with a few inspirational words of encouragement. \n\n\nThe Rising celebrates the anniversary of FFXIV's rebirth as A Realm Reborn, after the end of Version 1.0. It’s a chance to not only share in the celebration of what will this year be the 11th anniversary of A Realm Reborn, but also to remember those who perished during the Seventh Umbral Calamity despite the efforts of Louisoix on the Carteneau Flats. \n\n\n\n\nIn 2024, FFXIV's The Rising event runs from August 27 at 3 a.m. EST until September 11 at 11 p.m. EST, and you’ll be able to begin the event quest by talking to the Wandering Minstrel in Limsa Lominsa Upper Decks. There aren't many clues on the Lodestone yet about the contents of this year’s event quests, but the tagline is “Flowers bloom over the ocean, breathing the perfume of the past”. \n\n\nRegardless of what the event entails, as always, there are some rewards up for grabs if you take part. This year, you’ll get the Brushed-up Krile minion for participating, which is utterly adorable and a rare glimpse of Krile without her almost surgically attached hood and her newly obtained Pictomancer weapon. \n\n\n\n\n\nThere’s also a secondary housing item, likely purchased for Gil from the event vendor. The Rising Table Lamp is a slightly bizarre choice and doesn’t quite scream ‘The Rising’ to me, but it probably won’t be too expensive and I’m sure my specified event items Retainer won’t mind holding on to it for me until I can find a use for it.\n\nThe post Final Fantasy XIV celebrates The Rising 2024 with a picto-perfect Krile minion appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "I can’t say I normally pay close attention to the Computer Entertainment Developers Conference (CEDEC), but this year (as spotted by Twitter user gosokkyu), it is presenting the Engineering Division Award for Excellence to Hitoshi Iizawa for their very important work in arcade emulation. Not just any arcade emulation, but emulation of the early 3D-era Sega Model 2 and Model 3 platforms.\n\n\nIn terms of game preservation, arcade games are a difficult area. Each game could be on its own hardware or hardware variation. While console emulation focuses on recreating the hardware in a way that can run its library of games, a lot of arcade games have to be approached individually. Add to that the fact that 3D game hardware is much harder to emulate, and it can be a struggle.\n\n\nThe emulation was done specifically to fill out the arcades in the games by Ryu ga Gotoku studios. Games in the Yakuza/Like a Dragon/Judgment series had full recreations of Sega’s old arcade titles, such as Fighting Vipers, Virtua Fighter 2, and Sega Bass Fishing. Not only are the games present, but the cabinets themselves (such as the Sega Blast City) are presented in painstaking detail.\n\n\nThe award states that it’s in recognition of Iizawa’s technical expertise, as well as for presenting the buried games for today’s players. His work in porting old arcade games goes back to the ‘00s where he worked on Sega Ages 2500: Virtua Fighter 2 and later helped port Daytona USA to PS3 and Xbox 360.\n\n\nThere has been some progress in emulating Model 2 and Model 3 games by fan communities. However, having an official means to play these games is always a plus. I would like to see some titles from these platforms make their way to storefronts, rather than being contained as games within a game. Hopefully, this work will eventually lead to that.\n\nThe post Yakuza/Like A Dragon’s painstaking arcade emulation nets award for programmer appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Cosmic encounters are out there in The Sims 4. If you're  trying to get your own Sims abducted and encounter some extra-terrestrial life, here's how.\n\n\nFor starters, in order for your Sim to get abducted, you need to have The Sims 4: Get to Work expansion installed. Secondly, there are slim chances (roughly 25%) of the Sim returning with an alien baby brewing in their belly, and this can only happen to male Sims in the game. Female Sims can also get abducted, but they will only return with a moodlet.\n\n\nThere’s no set pattern or guarantee for the alien abduction to occur in The Sims 4. However, there are ways to increase the chances of an alien abduction in The Sims 4. First, keep in mind that the abduction can only occur any time between 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. Moreover, Sims who are scientists are more likely to get abducted.\n\n\nImage via Electronic Arts\n\n\nSims 4 Alien Abduction: How to increase your chances\n\n\n\nJoin the “Get to Work Scientist Career” with your Sim if you haven’t already.\n\n\nUnlock the Out of this World Desktop which is attained at Level 4. You can find the desktop in Electronics > Computer. You will also unlock the Satellite Dish at Level 4 which can be found in Electronics > Misc. Both will work for this method. (You can also use cheats in Sims 4 for this step).\n\n\nChoose the Contact Aliens option on either of the devices.\n\n\nInteract with the Telescope (Observatory) and choose the Search for the Truth option. The option is unlocked by reaching Level 7 Logic. Make sure you use this during the evening to increase the chances of the abduction when it’s nighttime.\n\n\n\nFollowing these steps should increase your chances of an alien abduction in The Sims 4. Keep repeating the process until the abduction happens. Good luck!\n\nThe post How to get abducted by aliens in The Sims 4 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "If you’re a fan of One Piece and enjoy a dip into the world of Mobile gaming, you’ve likely heard of One Piece: Bounty Rush. The 4 vs. 4 PvP capture the flag game is incredibly fun to play, has a gacha element, and bizarrely compelling. \n\n\nHowever, in my time with it the one place it fell flat was the clunky touchscreen controls. Maybe this is a me problem, but I’ve never quite been able to fully enjoy a game when using a touchscreen to control movement or attacks. This will soon be an issue of the past where Bounty Rush is concerned as Bandai Namco has revealed that One Piece: Bounty Rush is coming to Steam in Fall 2024.\n\n\n\n\nIn One Piece: Bounty Rush, you gain new characters from a huge roster of 200 possibly obtainable characters through the gacha system. Then, you use these characters in 4 vs. 4 Capture the Flag battles to win upgrade materials, currencies, and, let's face it, bragging rights. \n\n\nTransferring this touchscreen mobile game to larger screens is already a huge step in what I feel is the right direction, but the ability to play with WASD controls or even a controller (hopefully) will only give what is a truly fun game a new lease of life. \n\n\nImage via Bandai Namco\n\n\nOriginally released for mobile platforms back in 2018, Bounty Rush has more than 10 million downloads through the Google Play Store alone, and reviews are largely favorable. There are regular events held, including the current 5.5 Year Thank You Campaign, and you’re never short of new things to do. \n\n\nThere is currently no word as to whether progress made on mobile platforms will carry over to the Steam version of Bounty Rush, although even if you need to start over, you’ll have a world of fun clawing your way back up the league tables and kicking butt in battles against other players. \n\nThe post One Piece: Bounty Rush coming to PC via Steam this fall appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Black Myth: Wukong is a new action-RPG that should appeal to those who are keen on Souls-like games, particularly Sekiro. In fact, it looks as though plenty of people have already got a taste for it, as the numbers show Game Science's new release is really blowing up on Steam.\n\n\nDespite only coming out today, Black Myth is boasting some staggering numbers on SteamDB. At the time of writing, the game has registered 2,151,942 players within the last few moments, and it's going up all the time. That's to say nothing of the PS5 figures.\n\n\n\n\nTo put that into perspective, Elden Rings's peak concurrent player count on PC was 953,426 about two and a half years ago. Even more mind-blowing, it's beaten this year's smash hit Palworld, which, at its highest, registered 2,101,867 concurrent players, according to SteamDB.\n\n\nWoah-kong!\n\n\nGod I love a pun. Anyway, over two million players within hours of release means Black Myth is currently the second-most played game on Steam. The only thing that's ahead of it is PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS, which had a record of 3,257,248 players over six years ago. Counter-Strike 2 looks like small fries compared to these numbers.\n\n\nGiven what we're currently seeing – seriously, Wukong's concurrent player count keeps going up literally as I'm writing this – it's almost certain that the game is going to smash PUBG's figures. By the time this gets published on the site, that may already have happened.\n\n\nFor something that, to some, appears to have come out of nowhere, Black Myth: Wukong is easily going to be the talk of the town. Its gorgeous visuals and lean toward Chinese mythology are evidently things that have tickled a lot of people's fancies. \n\nThe post Black Myth: Wukong has already beaten Palworld for peak concurrent players appeared first on Destructoid.",

Among the many fixes, one stands out which was a bug that was causing the Liquidators part blueprints from showing up in some player’s main saves.\n\n\nFor context, finishing the Liquidators expedition, or any past No Man’s Sky expedition, rewards players with different rewards, and players can take the upgrades, technology and resources they’ve gathered in the expedition save back to their main save to continue enjoying them.\n\n\nThe major reward for the current No Man’s Sky Liquidators expedition is the Liquidator Minotaur, which is basically a mech that can be used for combat. Throughout the expedition, players earn several blueprints for the Liquidator Minotaur’s limbs which can be built to create the unique Minotaur.\n\n\nImage via Hello Games\n\n\nHowever, upon completion of the expedition and transferring items, players were not able to install the Liquidator Minotaur limbs in their existing saves. This issue has now been fixed by developer Hello Games, so if the blueprints were missing, you will now find them once you update No Man’s Sky.\n\n\nThere are also several other fixes including an issue that prevented Longshore S-Wing and Longshore C-Wing ship parts from being extracted when players were dismantling Haulers.\n\n\nDocking at spherical space stations has been improved. Another key highlight of No Man's Sky patch today is that the game now supports up to eight mouse buttons, allowing players more options for remapping their controls. No Man's Sky VR players would also be delighted to know that the team has made efforts to reduce VRAM requirements to run the game in VR, so there should ideally be better performance and less stress on the hardware while playing No Man's Sky VR.\n\n\nYou can also check out the complete No Man’s Sky Update 5.05 patch notes.\n\nThe post No Man’s Sky Patch 5.05 fixes bug preventing Liquidator Minotaur blueprints from showing up in main save appeared first on Destructoid.",

While most of the milestones should not cause you much trouble and have pretty straightforward steps, there are some challenges which could potentially eat up hours of time if players are not looking in the right direction.\n\n\nOne such challenge is the Apex Predator milestone in Phase 3.

To get access to these, you will need the Loong Scales, and this is where to get them.\n\n\nWhere to find the Loong Scales in Black Myth: Wukong\n\n\nTo get the Loong Scales, you need to play through the game until you reach the fight against the Second Prince of Flowing Sands near the Sandgate Village. Once this is over, you can activate the Valley of Despair Shrine. Head into the cave nearby, and this will bring you to yet another boss fight.\n\n\nThe complicated affairs of the Royal Family of Flowing Sands will play out, leaving you to fight the First Prince of FLowing Sands, the brother of the creature you just defeated. As you fight him, attempt to lure him into the ornate wall on one side of the arena. If you can get him to charge it, he will crack it, creating a hole you can get into after the fight is complete.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nIf he doesn't crack it, then you can use the Wandering Wight Spirit to get inside via the awesome power of a mighty headbutt. Make your way through the wall, and you will find the Loong Scales in a golden chest. I have not been able to try it myself, but the Azure Dust Transformation Spell from the Man In Stone merchant is also a way to get through.\n\n\nNow, I am not sure about all the boss locations for this just yet, but so far, I have found the following:\n\n\n\nChapter 1 - at the waterfall on the western side of the Forest. Spawn at the Outside the Forest Shrine, then move to the opposite side of the area where you fight the Wandering Wight. (Thanks for the heads up, Tom!)\n\n\nChapter 2 - The second one can be found behind the \"sandfall\" to the right of the Rockcrest Flat Shrine in the Yellow Wind Ridge region.\n\n\nThe post Where to find the Loong Scales in Black Myth: Wukong appeared first on Destructoid.",

As presented on the Paris Judicial Court's website, the list of domains amounts to a wall of merged text simply asking to be misinterpreted.
