Far from forgotten, there have been in the past two re-releases/remasters of the game on console, one on Game Boy Advance back in 2005 and 3DS in 2014. Is this third HD revisit — based on the 2018 PC release — worth its price in coal or is it just a load of hot air? Strap in to find out.\nThe action takes place in a familiar yet bizarre post-industrial revolution civilisation during a great war waged between the nations of the Republic of Silverhead and the Motorhead Empire (no smirking in the back, now). In this alternate 19th century, the steam engine has become the world’s greatest invention causing military machine design to evolve into gigantic monsters of steel and fire that rule the land, the sea. and the skies. You take the role of a nameless Silverhead republican pilot onboard the aircraft carrier Rheinhalt. Despite being greatly outnumbered, the technology of Silverhead is more advanced than their opponent, evident through your choice of aircraft and the mighty 'Imamio Thunder' bomb devices that can cause devastating damage to the steel-dependent Motorhead military units.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

That’s exactly where Toronto-founded developer Hilltop Studios is coming from with Lil’ Guardsman – and it's come up with something pretty great.\nThe game starts with an interesting parenting decision by Hamish, a guardsman in the fantasy kingdom of “The Sprawl”. He has an important bet to place at the goblinball arena so, naturally, he asks his 12-year-old daughter, Lil, to cover his shift at the guard shed. That decision kicks off a series of events that run the gamut from time-travelling border control duty, to a fantasy game show, to all-out war.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The Switch version sits with a Metascore of 62 from 11 critic reviews at the time of writing, although the PC version stands at 81.\nDespite our reservations, this cozy game held a lot of potential and in the months since, the development team at Pathea has been hard at work to correct flaws and bring in new content to keep players engaged. Arguably its biggest update on Switch — version 1.1.4 — is due out imminently, and to get a better sense of what it contains and what’s on the horizon, we recently sat down for a lengthy conversation with some key staff on the Sandrock team to discuss its past and, crucially, its future.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Does Apollo justice.\nAfter the success of the original three Ace Attorney games, series creator Shu Takumi was ready to end Phoenix Wright's story. But the world wasn't done with these surprisingly intriguing lawyer games, and so he had to figure out how to make a new game without re-treading old ground. Thus, Apollo Justice, pointy-haired greenhorn lawyer, was born – and Phoenix was unceremoniously disbarred. The following three games, now serialised as the Apollo Justice Trilogy, serve as Apollo's version of Phoenix's story – but because of that tension between Takumi's wants and the players' needs, Apollo never quite gets the spotlight all to himself.\nWe begin with Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney, set seven years after Trials and Tribulations. In that time, a lot has happened, and the familiar angles of Wright's face are buried behind stubble, grime, and a deep sense of ennui after having lost his attorney's badge. But Apollo Justice, our new main character, isn't going to give up that easily, and joins the Wright Anything Agency (formerly known as the Wright & Co. Law Offices) hoping to make a real difference to the legal profession. Unfortunately for him, he's entered his career during the Dark Age Of The Law, where cowboy prosecutors and manipulative murderers will stop at nothing to get the results they want.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

If so, you'll probably want a Mini ITX AM5 motherboard, and this one from Asus is one of the very best available: the Asus ROG Strix B650E-I Gaming WiFi. It cost £329.99 last year, but now it's on sale from Amazon UK for just £239.99 - a £90 savings and still £30 cheaper than Asus' official web store.\nRead more",

          "description": "Basically the only sort of strategy games I like are city builders, so I was interested in the playtest for El Dorado: The Golden City Builder, which casts you as the leader of an ancient Mayan-ish city. The playtest is only the prologue, but the eventual goal is to take over the Yucatán peninsula, and if nothing else it's refreshing to see a city-builder that doesn't feel overwhelmingly European. It also has a complicated system of religion. Whereas in a similarly polytheistic game like Zeus, the gods would turn up to stomp on buildings and/or bless them, at fairly large intervals, in El Dorado I was getting a home immolated every few days. Building shrines that have an area of effect, and that require resources to run and protect your town, is its own supply chain in El Dorado. This is a very interesting idea that I liked.\nBut. The aforementioned deities are figures from Maya mythology, and the Yucatán peninsula is the bit where the Mayans lived, so I just find it a bit sus the word \"Mayan\" does not appear anywhere on the Steam page or in the press release materials. Sometimes said materials say \"the Yucatán peninsula\", and sometimes \"the mystical land of Jukatan\", which could well be an innocent translation mistake, but doesn't make me less sus. I've hedged my bets by saying \"Mayan-ish\" - just as an uncharitable person could say the devs are doing...\nRead more",

That $150 discount turns this into a great alternative to a traditional two monitor setup, letting you have tons of space for getting work done as well as a super-immersive ultrawide gaming experience - just lovely. \nRead more",

While the game's mechanics are more reminiscent of Ark: Survival Evolved and other tree-punching, template-arranging wilderness sims, its monsters owe obvious debts to Nintendo and Game Freaks' Pokémon games. \nThe developers have something of a track record on this front, with their older early access release Craftopia freely stirring in nods to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. But what separates copyright infringement from a flagrant, but perfectly legal rip-off?

          "description": "For a series that's defined by its trials and elaborate murder cases, the greatest crime in Ace Attorney history is arguably one we never get to see or take part in. Okay, maybe crime is too strong a word. Miscarriage of justice is perhaps more appropriate, and specifically that of Apollo Justice, the cover star of this latest trilogy in Capcom's beloved lawyer 'em up. Except poor old Apollo isn't really what holds this collection of Ace Attorneys 4, 5 and 6 together at all. Sure, he features in all of them, but at the end of the day, it's still the series' original bluffer supreme Phoenix Wright who heads up most of the casework here, relegating his new protegee back to bench-warming duties almost as soon as Apollo's debut game rolls its credits. What's more, he quickly has to share that space with Athena Cykes, another new hotshot lawyer that enters the firm in Dual Destinies and continues the scrappy defence trifecta in Spirit Of Justice.\nThe result is a set of games that feel considerably wobblier than Capcom's first and more robust Ace Attorney trilogy, and quite a bit more unfocused than the more recent Victorian-era spin-off, The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles. But despite a slightly unsure start, there are still plenty of career highs to be found here for Wright, Cykes and Justice, and Spirit Of Justice in particular remains one of the series' best entries to date. Those new to Ace Attorney should absolutely begin their journey elsewhere, but for series completionists, the Apollo Justice Trilogy is quite the welcome development.\nRead more",

Right now, it's doing almost twice the numbers of Steam's usual chart-topper Counter-Strike 2. We have entered the Pal Age, it seems - but how long will the feeding frenzy last? How much is owing to it releasing during the quiet time of year with a meme-ish premise, while capitalising on pent-up demand for a proper PC version of Nintendo's monster-catching series? Much will depend, I think, on how quickly developers Pocketpair can update it and stay ahead of the usual early access game avalanche of community requests and complaints.\r\n \nRead more",

But me, after six hours of walking over thin, old snow, the good stuff finally started to fall as I entered a wood and approached a waterfall. Pretty magic, really.

          "description": "For a game that's been repeatedly described as \"Pokémon with machineguns\", the first thing that strikes me about Palworld is just how un-Pokémon-like it actually is. To its credit, it does do quite a good Pokémon Legends: Arceus impression when you first step out on its big, Breath Of The Wild-style hilltop and take in the open world vista of its monster-stuffed starting continent. But if the opening moments of washing up on the island in nothing but your very scantily clad undies hadn't already given it away (seriously, why do shipwrecks always destroy the clothes you had on, but not your smalls underneath?), then the ream of tutorial prompts about punching trees to get more wood, building bases, putting pals to work on said bases, and the endless parade of crafting technologies you'll need to unlock to actually do anything on this godforsaken rock will quickly pull the wool clear away from your hopeful little face. \nFor underneath the cute round eyes of its cover stars, Palworld is really a survival game wearing the dead skin suits of Game Freak's catch 'em all monster friends. In a lot of cases, those skin suits are quite literal, such are the blatant palette swaps and so-close-to-copyright-infringement-I-can't-believe-Nintendo's-lawyers-haven't-shut-this-down-years-ago rip-off creatures on display here. For that reason alone, Palworld can feel about as soulless and cynical as it comes. But that's not the worst of it. Even aside from all the survival gubbins, base building and sweatshop automation practices shoved down your throat, Palworld is just an awful example of monster-catching games in general. If it's a Pokémon game on PC you're after, go and play Cassette Beasts. Go and play Coromon, TemTem, or Monster Sanctuary. Anything but this. \nRead more",

The first to come out (albeit only on Netflix at the moment) was the turn-based strategy game Highwater (also a bit of a dud, based on the early Steam demo I played last year), but it's the second game, The Cub (out today on Steam) that has prompted this current moment of teeth-sucking sadness. \nI've been playing a bit of it over the last week, and oh man, it's trying so, so hard to be like Limbo and Inside, but just... doing quite a terrible job of it all.

An earlier version of this review would have been a very negative on, filled mostly with complaints and annoyances about opaque and frustrating systems, most of which I've since got over as the intent behind its design has become more clear.\nIt could definitely explain some things better, and its inscrutably tiny graphics remain a minor nuisance. But it's grown on me a lot, and though it may not be quite the kind of turn-based RPG I get on with best, it's an enjoyable one with a refreshing lack of bloat and timewasting, and with a class and combat system that will be pure catnip to a particular kind of player.\nRead more",

It has a 10/10 pun name and introduces/strengthens concepts that I expect will become series mainstays as we continue with this project, but this is definitely in \"difficult second album\" territory. I don't hate it! But it's no Secrets Can Kill, and I think that's in part down to increased ambition, as our Nance is called upon to solve a poison pen puzzle at a TV studio.\nRead more",

Not that any of them could decide how to actually pronounce WASD when it came to talking about them on last night's Developer Update stream, though, as there were competing cries of \"was-dee\", \"wased\" and \"double-you-ey-es-dee\" all over the shop as they debated this clearly very \"controversial topic\" live on air.

          "description": "Back in the depths of 2023's February Steam Next Fest, Roots Of Yggdrasil was one of a handful of games that really caught my attention. Not because it was another beautiful-looking deckbuilder (though that does seem to be a steadily growing niche of mine these days), or because its colourful, inkwash visuals had the air of a Norse-flavoured Okami about them (though it did also help). Rather, it was the way its roguelike foundations meshed with its freeform, but still very goal-driven turn-based building systems, giving you drive and purpose in your construction choices, while also being light and chill, with just the right amount of existential threat nipping at your heels.\nIt struck me that if, say, my best puzzle strategy bud Dorfromantik was ever turned into a roguelike, this is probably a good approximation of what it would look and feel like, which is, frankly, yep, I'd like that game right now, please. Happily, with Roots Of Yggdrasil now approaching its early access launch on January 24th, I'm very happy to report that it's come on leaps and bounds since that Next Fest demo. This is already a very moreish and polished building game, and I've been struggling to tear myself away from it as I guide my longboat of magic Vikings away from their impending Ragnarok.\nRead more",

And also he tears up any paperwork handed to him.

I keep turning this fact over in my head as I watch Lazy Bear Games' associate producer Vlada Redko play a portion of Bandle Tale over Discord for me, with creative director Nikita Kulaga and Riot Forge's creative director Rowan Parker telling me about what's happening onscreen in front of me. As Redko explores the whimsical, knitting-themed city of Bandle as one of League Of Legends' tiny fluffy Yordle creatures, it is, to put it lightly, quite the tonal shift from their previous work. But don't let its cute looks fool you.\nThis is a crafting RPG with a ferociously long set of skill trees to master, with 40-60 hours' worth of new abilities to learn, objects to construct, errands to run, friends to enlist and - crucially - parties to throw. For in the Bandle woods of Runeterra, life's problems are solved by having a good old fashioned boogie, including the rather urgent issue of fixing the world's portal network, which has collapsed in a mysterious accident. It may have a softer, fluffier-looking surface than Graveyard Keeper, but underneath it looks as though there's just as much to dig into here, so here's what I've learned so far ahead of its release on February 21st.\nRead more",

If you've never watched it before, I recommend loading up the Twitch stream at about 1am and sort of gently dissociating while someone plays an 80s NES game you've never heard of. Speaking of, one of the headline acts for this year's stream - which is running through to this Sunday 21st - was Peanut Butter, a shiba inu trained to press buttons on command, \"playing\" a NES game that came out in 1985. Although Peanut Butter obeyed his training, some technical issues colluded to snatch a world best time from him - but he raised many thousands of dollars, so good for him.\nPeanut Butter is the latest high tide line in the efforts to put more weird and difficult hurdles between you and the controls of games when speedrunning or streaming them.

Mezi hlavní novinky patří nová architektura WoW64, která umožňuje využít 64bitová volání z 32bitového kódu. To znamená, že je možné spouštět 32bitové aplikace systému Windows na čistě 64bitové instalaci hostitelského systému. V původním řešení bylo nutné pro běh 32bitové aplikace spouštět 32bitový hostitelský proces. Nový režim není zatím ve výchozím stavu zapnutý a je nutné ho povolit v konfiguraci.",

          "description": "astragon Entertainment and Mi'pu'mi Games have released Howl on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S today. It was initially released in November 2023 on PC and Switch.\n\n\nHowl is one that escaped me. When I think back to November, it’s mostly a blur to me, so that’s no surprise. However, it looks interesting from screenshots and the title of the press release reads “critically acclaimed.” That phrase gets stretched pretty far in the PR world, but, sure enough, Opencritic shows a warm reception from the publications that covered it.\n\n\n\n\nThe announcement also describes Howl as folklore turn-based strategy. A strange howling turns anyone who hears it into werewolves. You play as a deaf heroine who is searching to cure it. From the trailer, it looks to be more of a puzzle game than a turn-based strategy title. You plan your moves in six steps, changing positions on the tiled field and completing actions to try and evade or take down enemies. If you’ll forgive the somewhat obscure reference, it reminds me of Trogdor the Board Game.\n\n\nThere are 60 stages through 4 chapters, and you unlock new abilities and upgrades as you progress through the world map. Most striking, however, is the art style, which looks like it’s hand-drawn in a simple storybook style. \n\n\nI’m bringing this up not just to warn PlayStation and Xbox players that it’s now available to their chosen platform but also for anyone else who, like me, might have missed it at first.\n\n\nHowl is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, and PC.\n\nThe post Storybook strategy game Howl has been released on PS5 and Xbox appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's playable for everyone with an iPhone 15 Pro or iPads and Macs with the M-series chip. It will be available for download via the Apple App Store on January 30. \n\n\n\n\nThe Director's Cut was initially released for PlayStation 5 in September 2021. It was then followed with a PC iteration in March 2022. Within it comes the base game, as well as a new underground factory location, expanded story missions, and various delivery assists to make navigating terrain a bit easier. \n\n\n505 Games is publishing the port. The Death Stranding Director's Cut is being listed on the App Store for $39.99. However, those who preorder ahead of the January 30 launch can enjoy a nice 50% discount on their purchase. It's the first of potentially many future titles that Kojima has committed to bring to Apple's platforms. \n\n\nPlayers who own multiple newer Apple products should be aware that the game incorporates Apple's Special Delivery feature. This enables those with Mac and iOS devices to purchase the Director's Cut once and have it playable across all platforms.

          "description": "The team behind 2022's excellent movie-mystery Immortality is back with not one, but two new projects. Sam Barlow and Half Mermaid have stealthily launched Steam pages for Project C and Project D.\n\n\nBoth projects contain heavy redactions in their page descriptions and info, much like how Immortality was called \"Project Ambrosio.\" Barlow responded to the teasers getting spotted by accounts like Wario64, though we don't have much more to go on now besides the pages themselves.\n\n\n\n\nProject C is the new cinematic... something from Barlow and Half Mermaid, his studio that's produced both Telling Lies and Immortality. (Barlow's previous Her Story lists him as the sole developer and publisher.) You will appear to do something for the first time ever in a video game, for what that's worth.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Project D is a survival horror game from the Half Mermaid crew. Keywords include \"nurse,\" \"1983,\" \"nightmare,\" and \"be careful.\" Seems like something worth paying attention to for Silent Hill fans, at the least.\n\n\nLife preserved in the pictures\n\n\nAlongside this news, Barlow and co. also confirmed a partnership with Lost in Cult for a new Design Works book about the making of Immortality. All that, plus Immortality hitting PlayStation today, makes for a big news day for the Half Mermaid team.\n\n\nIt's interesting to see the Half Mermaid crew tackle two projects, and tease them out at the same time. Immortality was an absolutely captivating game that easily stole a spot in my end-of-year favorites, so I'm keen to see what's next for them. Both a cinematic work and a survival horror effort makes me curious, though. We really only have a few screenshots and scattered text to go on, though. It's good fodder for all the House of Leaves fans, I guess.\n\n\nWe'll learn more about Project C and D soon, hopefully. In the mean time, play Immortality if you haven't, preferably with the lights off and sitting too close to the monitor.\n\nThe post Sam Barlow and Half Mermaid tease some mysterious new projects appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is right around the corner on February 29, so Square Enix is capitalizing on the thirst for more Cloud and Sephiroth with special screenings of the CG-animated Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children film a week ahead of launch. \n\n\nOriginally released nearly two decades ago in 2005, the Tetsuya Nomura-directed feature is a characteristically over-the-top look at the world of Final Fantasy VII two years after the events of the original game. The film's return to theaters is the result of a collaboration between Square Enix, Fathom Events, and Sony Pictures. It will mark the first time for the Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children Complete director's cut version to hit cinemas.\n\n\nImage via Square Enix\n\n\nThe screenings will be in theaters for just two days. Those who want to see Cloud's Buster Sword in the largest format possible can check out the English-dubbed version on February 21, followed by the subtitled version on February 22. The director's cut is a whopping 26 minutes longer than the theatrical release, packing in various visual improvements and around a thousand updated scenes. The story finds a mysterious new illness spreading quickly throughout the world, bringing old enemies back out of the woodwork and forcing Cloud to pick up his impossibly heavy blade and get back into action. \n\n\nIf you do decide to head to the theater for this one next month, Square Enix wants you to prepare for a history lesson before the lights dim. Folks who show up early will be treated to exclusive introductory content like the history of Final Fantasy VII, how it connects to Advent Children, interviews with Tetsuya Nomura and Rebirth director Naoki Hamaguchi, and more. \n\nThe post Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children heads back to US theaters ahead of Rebirth appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Following some delays, Freedom Planet 2 finally made its PC debut in September 2022, and now it has its sights set on consoles. Publisher XSEED Games announced plans to bring developer GalaxyTrail's sequel to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch on April 4, 2024.\n\n\nIn addition to showing off the four heroines of Freedom Planet 2 and their high-speed exploits, the release date trailer previews a brand new mode. When Freedom Planet 2 hits consoles it will come with the oft-requested Boss Rush mode across all platforms, including a simultaneous update on PC. Split into two divisions with 17 boss challenges in each one, Boss Rush mode will be accessible via the in-game Battlesphere when it goes live. Beating the bosses in both divisions will unlock an in-game VIP room full of easter eggs that long-time fans should appreciate.\n\n\n\n\nXSEED has digital releases set for all platforms, with the Switch eShop release offering 10% off pre-orders from now until a week after launch. The PlayStation release will include a bundle of both the PS4 and PS5 versions, and those who opt to check it out on Xbox will be able to take advantage of Smart Delivery to access the optimal version of the game on both platforms. \n\n\nI haven't played the sequel yet, but the first Freedom Planet was pretty much the ideal Sonic game I never knew I needed, so I'm psyched for this one to hit consoles. It all makes sense considering the series' origins as a Sonic the Hedgehog fangame by GalaxyTrail founder Sabrina DiDuro. If you can't wait until the console release, you can nab the sequel for the same price of $24.99 on Steam right now. \n\nThe post Freedom Planet 2 zips to consoles on April 4, adds Boss Rush mode appeared first on Destructoid.",

Princess Peach: Showtime! is coming to the Nintendo Switch in March, and Nintendo dropped a new trailer today teasing what's on the way.\n\n\nThe leader of the Mushroom Kingdom leaves the crown behind and takes on a series of new roles in the upcoming title. Many of which you can catch in the new Princess Peach: Showtime! trailer below. \n\n\n\n\nSo far, we've seen Peach sport several different hats, including a cowgirl getup, detective 'fit, swordfighter ensemble, and even a patissiere costume complete with Yoshi's Cookie-inspired designs. \n\n\nThe gist of Princess Peach: Showtime! revolves around Peach and a few of her closest toads putting on a show at the famed Sparkle Theater of the Mushroom Kingdom. However, shockingly to everyone, some bad guys arrive to heckle the performers and put an end to the show. \n\n\nGameplay-wise, Peach will tackle a bunch of different roles as she travels from stage to stage in an effort to take down the nefarious Grape and the Sour Bunch. Yes, that is their real name.\n\n\nTo squash Grape and his crew, the Mushroom Kingdom Princess will take on numerous roles, including Swordfighter Peach, Patissiere Peach, Cowgirl Peach, Ninja Peach, Detective Peach, Kung Fu Peach, and likely several more that we haven't seen yet. \n\n\nPrincess Peach: Showtime! gives us the Princess' first solo outing since 2005's Super Princess Peach on the Nintendo DS. It's one of the better non-Mario Mario games out there. The character is long overdue for a new outing of her own, especially after the character's strong depiction in The Super Mario Bros. Movie.\n\n\nPeach will look to make Grape whine and go home when Princess Peach: Showtime! raises the curtains on March 22. \n\nThe post New Princess Peach: Showtime! trailer shows Peach in a variety of roles appeared first on Destructoid.",

To get you ready for the game, Ironwood Studios has released a video that covers the core gameplay.\n\n\nIt isn’t hard to understand the basics of Pacific Drive, but there are a lot of deeper systems to keep in mind. For example, gathering anchor energy is important, but you might not realize how important it really is until you’re caught in an area with reality collapsing around you. So, you can learn from your mistakes like I did, or you can watch this video.\n\n\n\n\nHaving played Pacific Drive, I can tell you that this 10-minute video is pretty all-encompassing, covering car maintenance, survival, scavenging, and upgrading. If you’re not sure what the game is going to play like, this will tell you what it is and what it isn’t. Also, look at it this way, it will allow you to glide through the tutorial parts pretty easily.\n\n\nI previewed Pacific Drive a while back, and while I have some reservations, my time with it left me excited to get my hands on the full experience. There’s a lot of elements of what I love mixed in there, and I’m wondering how well they’ll fare when stretched out to a full experience. I’m worried that the core gameplay loop will become repetitive, so I’m hoping to see a lot of surprises scattered about as you proceed further into the zone.\n\n\nPacific Drive is out on February 22, 2024 for PS4 and PC.\n\nThe post This Pacific Drive ‘Surviving the Zone’ video gives a deep 10 minute primer appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "If you've been itching to see retro games be given a bit of a pep in this modern gaming world, Nvidia's RTX modding toolkit is already realizing that dream. With the open beta now out, prepare yourselves for an upscaled return of some classics.\n\n\nIn a rather lengthy post, Nvidia has outlined exactly what the RTX Remix software is capable of. In a nutshell: it's a \"cutting-edge modding platform\" that allows for games from a bygone era to be given a bit of a remaster.\n\n\n\n\nThe above video shows what it can do. In this instance, we can see ray-tracing versions of Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind and Half-Life 2, complete with higher definition assets. We're already seeing it in the likes of Tomb Raider and Vice City, so expect a lot more to come out of the woodwork now Remix is out in beta.\n\n\nAlso comes with DLSS 3.5 and Ray Reconstruction\n\n\nI suppose one of the questions modders may have is: will RTX Remix be compatible with any game? While it's designed to work with a lot of different titles, Nvidia says its \"level of compatibility may vary depending on the complexity of the game’s assets and engine.\"\n\n\nWe know it works on older games because we've already seen it in action. The software \"works best with DirectX 8 and 9 games with fixed function pipelines.\" Things like Hitman 2, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines, and Call of Duty 2 should work, as well as the aforementioned ones.\n\n\nWhether you're sick of remasters, remakes, reboots, and other \"re-\" words or not, RTX Remix is probably going to see a boon in unofficial remasters of video games from yesterday that have been given a shiny new coat.\n\nThe post Nvidia RTX Remix beta now out, expect shiny remasters of classic games appeared first on Destructoid.",

With that in-mind, it seems the studio is now looking to make some headway on the new Witcher saga.\n\n\nThat's according to a recent report from Reuters. The developer's joint CEO, Adam Badowski, tells the publication that the team is aiming to start the \"production phase\" on the first entry in the next set of Witcher games, currently codenamed Polaris.\n\n\n\n\nBadowski goes on to say that the company would like to \"have around 400 people working on the project by the middle of the year.\" CDPR is also at the \"conceptual phase\" regarding the follow-up to Cyberpunk 2077, with around 80 people expected to be working on that game by the end of 2024. CD Projekt Red has also apparently considered multiplayer elements for the new Cyberpunk, but isn't discussing details right now.\n\n\nWin some, lose some\n\n\nOn top of this, a recent post on Twitter announced that Phantom Liberty has been nominated for \"Outstanding Visual Effects in a Real-Time Project\" at the 22nd Annual Visual Effects Society Award.\n\n\nThe Cyberpunk DLC was not only the culmination of a lot of work fixing the glaring issues that plagued the game, but it was also something of a swansong for the dystopian RPG. CD Projekt Red may well take what harsh lessons it's learned and apply them to the sequel.\n\n\nHowever, the Reuters report goes on to say that the studio may be looking into artificial intelligence for some of its future releases. Michal Nowakowsk said he thinks \"AI is something that can help improve certain processes in game production,\" but added that it couldn't \"replace people.\" Make of that what you will.\n\nThe post CD Projekt Red to ramp into ‘production phase’ of new Witcher game this year appeared first on Destructoid.",

Maybe it's a bit cliché to say it's taking the industry by storm, but the data shows just how massive it's been in such a short span of time.\n\n\nWe've already spoken about how the game has been smashing Steam records, but the numbers just keep going up and up. At the time of writing, not only has Palworld surpassed 1.8 million players within the last few minutes, but it's also become the second-most-played Steam game ever, according to stats from SteamDB. This puts it ahead of Valve's own Counter-Strike 2.\n\n\n\n\nOn top of that, a recent tweet from the developer says the game has now sold more than six million copies. That's in the space of four days, remember?\n\n\nLet me catch my breath, please!\n\n\nI seriously can't keep up with the figures. Between pitching this story and writing these very words, Palworld seems to keep breaking expectations. By the time this article gets published, I'm anticipating news about how it's elevated itself above human comprehension and has taken over the very cosmos.\n\n\nBut how long can something like this last? It's not even been a week, but the number of people playing has exceeded what anyone could have predicted. It's knocked the Steam Deck off its number one spot, which is something that even the most hyped-up games struggle to do.\n\n\nAnd the best part is, it is still in Early Access. It's pretty bug-ridden (it's straight up crashed my Xbox twice already, to the point where I thought it had bricked the console at one point), but there's something about a \"Pokémon-with-guns\" game that's got everyone talking. Surely the bubble will burst soon, yeah?\n\nThe post Palworld just keeps hitting milestone after milestone appeared first on Destructoid.",

We get quite a few of them throughout the year, and this latest one will appeal to your inner pirate (and ninja. Don't forget the ninjas).\n\n\nAs of January 22, the Steam Pirates vs. Ninjas Fest began, providing a host of discounts on all things related to the aforementioned buccaneer and/or stealth assassin lifestyle. The best way to get an idea of what exactly is in the sale is to open the link above, but the video below gives a quick overview of what to expect. \n\n\n\n\nYou'll find games like Sekiro, Ninja Gaiden: Master Collection, Pillars of Eternity II, Secret of Monkey Island, TMNT: Shredder's Revenge, and may more as part of the event. Essentially, if it's a pirate or ninja-themed game, it's probably here.\n\n\nFrom laissez-faire economics to bootleggin'\n\n\nPersonally, I'm tempted by Monkey Island, as it's still something I haven't got round to playing yet.

          "description": "If you feel recent roguelite games have been missing that platform fighter touch, Spiritfall is here to answer the call. Developer Gentle Giant's action game takes notes from Super Smash Bros., Brawlhalla, and similarly hectic platform fighter fare, and it's set to launch in full on February 28, 2024.\n\n\nSpiritfall has been available in Early Access since April 3, 2023, and has garnered 'Very Positive' reviews from players in the months since. The release date news came along with a new animated trailer that shows off some slick cinematics and a sample of the fast-paced action at the heart of it all. \n\n\n\n\nWhen Spiritfall shared its Early Access update roadmap back in November, the devs detailed a few of the additions on the way to the full version. These include the final region and boss fight along with a new optional boss, fifth alternate weapon form, all challenge levels, and \"more surprises.\" Gentle Giant has stayed pretty active in updating the game since it became available, knocking out 10 monthly content updates on top of the usual intermittent hotfixes. \n\n\nEven if you haven't played it for yourself yet, you can certainly see that platform brawler style at work in the trailer. Spiritfall combines that frantic fighting with roguelite features such as randomly generated maps and the ability to unlock new powers, upgrade skills, and gather a bunch of weapons to make the going a little less tough for each successive run. Brawlhalla by way of Dead Cells will no doubt be enough of a hook for most to at least dip their toes in what this one has to offer.  \n\nThe post Smash Bros-inspired roguelite Spiritfall leaves Early Access on February 28 appeared first on Destructoid.",

With Persona 3 Reload launching next week, Atlus West's YouTube released an out-of-the-blue live-action commercial with Aidan Gallagher.\n\n\n\n\nPersona 3 Reload is an RPG/life sim where you take on the role of Makoto Yuki, a recent transfer to Gekkoukan High. He then becomes a member of the Specialized Extracurricular Execution Squad (S.E.E.S) and takes on the many levels of Tartarus during the elusive Dark Hour at midnight. \n\n\nThe almost minute-and-a-half-long trailer, titled \"Seal Your Fate\", features The Umbrella Academy actor casually taking a stroll through the halls of Gekkoukan High and Tartarus and, of course, monologuing about time. Aidan becomes an in-game character at some points, ending off with slaying a Shadow himself. It's a weird mix …",

          "description": "Teyon has announced that RoboCop: Rogue City is getting a content update that will include new game plus, a new difficulty, and an Auto9 skin. It’s available now on PC, with the console versions getting it tomorrow.\n\n\nRoboCop: Rogue City was a pleasant surprise last year. The licensed title went on to win a prestigious “On Zoey’s favorite games of 2023 list” award, one of the most unprestigious honors in the industry. One complaint I did have about the game is that I wanted to play it again after I completed it, but I didn’t want to start over from scratch. Now, it’s finally safe to reinstall it now that it will be getting new game plus.\n\n\n\n\nOn top of that, there’s a new, harder difficulty based on Murphy’s frequent utterance, “There Will Be Trouble.” Not much more has been revealed about the difficulty, but it’s safe to say it will be more difficult. Personally, I like playing as a walking tank, so I’m not sure being squishier will make the game more fun for me.\n\n\nFinally, the Auto9 pistol gets a new skin once you complete the game. This one is gold plated, which is nicely garish. If you’re not familiar, RoboCop does allow you to pick up discarded guns off of enemies, but Murphy’s main sidearm never stops being effective. Rarely would I use anything else, except when it came to boss battles. However, not once did I stop and think it would be better if it was more ostentatious.\n\n\nRoboCop: Rogue City is available for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. The new game plus patch has been released on PC, with the console versions getting it tomorrow.\n\nThe post RoboCop: Rogue City gets new game plus as part of a content update appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "You may have noticed that at the bottom corner of your screen in Palworld, there is a string of numbers indicating what version you're playing. Steam and Xbox Game Pass have different versions, and here's why. \n\n\nA report from Windows Central highlighted comments from Pocketpair reps in the Palworld Discord server. There, Pocketpair's community manager, Bucky, explained a bit about what's going on with the different versions. The problem is that every game's version has to go through Microsoft's certification queue. This is something Pocketpair has no control over, though the team is \"desperately trying to speed up,\" it highlights on Discord. \n\n\n\nSo there are actually two separate versions of the game, \"because the fundamental architecture is different,\" with version 1.2.0 awaiting certification from Microsoft. This isn't an act of malice on Xbox's part, though there are a few differences between the two versions. Though the version on Microsoft's Xbox One claims multiplayer is available, it isn't. Pocketpair also noted it's aware of \"serious bugs\" impacting servers, multiplayer, and more in an update on Twitter. \n\n\n\n\nThere are also minor differences - bugs, some would call a few of them - such as the occasional lack of console keys on screen but I've been lucky to avoid most of them. These will also be fixed eventually, and it will take time before \"content parity\" is reached between PC and Xbox. \n\n\n\nIt's argued that Xbox isn't necessarily \"behind,\" but yet it is. Our list of differences demonstrates that this is the case. Nevertheless, you can enjoy the game on Xbox Game Pass without really noticing you're playing an earlier build. \n\n\nUntil features parity is reached, keep collecting Pals, building weapons, and having fun with this survival game that shocked the world by being one of 2024's first hits. \n\nThe post Palworld on Xbox and Steam have different versions – Here’s why appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Ratalaika has announced that they’re publishing a collection of the two modern NES titles of the The Adventures of Panzer series. The Adventures of Panzer: Legacy Collection comes to Xbox Series X|S, PS4, PS5, and Switch on January 26, 2024.\n\n\nThe original Adventures of Panzer title was released back in 2021 by Pixelcraft Games. It was built in NES Maker, which means that it runs on original NES hardware. A Kickstarter in 2022 allowed them to also publish the game on cartridge. The Adventures of Panzer 2 followed it up in 2023, and also went through Kickstarter for physical publishing.\n\n\n\n\nBoth games are action platformers, both touting a humorous and light-hearted narrative. The first game sees the eponymous Panzer traveling to five different levels to try and assemble his old team. The second game, set a year after the events of the first, sees that team fighting “a new evil.” In addition to being longer at 9 levels, you're also able to switch between the four characters.\n\n\nNot much is said about the added features of the port, if any.\n\n\nThe NES is my happy place. Even though I was too young for it to really make an impact on my childhood, I’ve grown to love the simple graphics common on the system enforced by its hardware limitations. What I find weird about Adventures of Panzer is that the little characters look like they’re in a completely different resolution than the rest of the game, but they’re not, so maybe the pixel doubling is just a design decision. Weird.\n\n\nThe Adventures of Panzer: Legacy Collection releases on Xbox Series X|S, PS4, PS5, and Switch on January 26, 2024. It’s worth noting that at $8.99, the collection is roughly $2 more than buying the two games individually for PC on itch.io.\n\nThe post A pair of modern NES games are being compiled in The Adventures of Panzer: Legacy Collection appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Atari has announced that qomp2, the follow-up to the 2021 Pong continuation, will be released on February 20 on PC and console.\n\n\nqomp was a game that dared to ask dangerous questions like, “What would happen if the Pong ball escaped from the confines of the court and went on an adventure?” I’m not sure how you extrapolate further on that, but Atari and Graphite Lab are going to try. They promise “An enigmatic story of doubt, fear, and self-acceptance, told wordlessly through simple effects and gameplay.” Sounds appropriately depressing.\n\n\nAlongside the announcement of the release date, they released a short video of the Pong ball being interviewed in vertical cell-phone ratio, and I kind of hate it. I wonder if it’s the knee-jerk revulsion I have toward social media that’s the problem.\n\n\nI didn’t play the original qomp, but it does sound like a fun premise. For a little while, at least. The first game was only played using a single button, but qomp2 adds a second one that is used for dash. It’s a logical evolution. Pong used no buttons, qomp used one, and qomp2 will use two of them.\n\n\nThis falls in line with Atari’s new focus on smaller games that leverage their existing brands. It’s a bit interesting that, while the original game was created by a group of indie developers under Stuffed Wombat, qomp2 has been handed off to Atari’s frequent collaborator, Graphite Lab. I have to wonder if they’ll be able to capture the same charm and impact of the original qomp.\n\n\nqomp2 will launch for PC, Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 4 and 5 on February 20, 2024.\n\nThe post Atari announces that qomp2 releases on February 22 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Last week, many of us were excited to see the official reveal trailer of MachineGames' upcoming Indiana Jones title The Great Circle. But footage shown at Developer Direct last week appears to be hinting at the return of Quake.\n\n\nDuring the showcase of the upcoming Indiana Jones release – at around the 11:35 mark – we see a quick shot of a whiteboard, covered in barely legible red ink. However, among these scrawls you can clearly make out the iconic logo from the first Quake game.\n\n\n\n\nJust above that, it's also possible to make out the characters \"AKE 6.\" Given that the first letter is almost cut off from the screen, it could be inferred that this is the other half of the word \"QUAKE.\"\n\n\nIndy goes gothic\n\n\nThis could easily be nothing more than a throwaway reference, but the fact that it appears at all is interesting. Now, you don't need me to tell you that there's been no confirmation of any Quake projects in the pipeline. At least none that we're aware of.\n\n\nHaving said that, with developer MachineGames taking the reins on the modern Wolfenstein titles – not to mention last year's Quake 2 remaster, in which the studio contributed new maps – no one would be surprised if the team turned its attention to the original Quake.\n\n\nWhether this would be a reboot or a new entry cannot be said, but given that the number six is present in the Indiana Jones trailer, it could be a continuation. If you're thinking there are only four games in the Quake series, consider Quake Champions the fifth installment. Or even Enemy Territory: Quake Wars.\n\n\nIn any case, these are just rumors at the moment. Chances are, if anyone was going to bring the legendary FPS back, who better than id Software? But MachineGames would definitely be a solid choice, so we'll just have to wait and see if the hidden clue in the video is more than just an Easter egg.\n\nThe post Fans spot a Quake 6 teaser hidden in the Indiana Jones trailer appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Outside of Resident Evil, Alone in the Dark is one of the most influential survival horror games of all time. While we wait for Pieces Interactive's take on the upcoming reimagining, THQ Nordic has shown what you can expect if you opt for the special version of the game.\n\n\nOver on the publisher's YouTube channel (as spotted by Bloody Disgusting), we get a little showcase on the Alone in the Dark bonuses that come with the Deluxe Edition. For starters, there are some \"authentic Vintage Horror Filters,\" as well as the director's commentary, if that's your thing.\n\n\n\n\nBut the one that will strike a chord with older fans is the \"1992 Costume Pack.\" This – as the name implies – gives the new game the same, low-poly look that the original AITD release had all the way back in the early 90s.\n\n\n\"Ma'am, please stop staring at my triangular nose.\"\n\n\nSpecifically, it affects the models, turning them from their more modern, highly detailed selves to how they originally looked. It's a nice little way of seeing just how far we've come in terms of video game visuals. Also, nostalgia. Nostalgia is good as well.\n\n\nWhile it's been tough for Alone in the Dark to keep its head above the water – what with some mediocre reboots and new installments – this could be the one that reignites interest in the iconic series once more.\n\n\nI'll tell you for why: For me, personally, this latest attempt to breathe new life into the franchise has been penned by Mikael Hedberg. Even if you don't recognize the name, horror fans will know his work from Amnesia: The Dark Descent, Amnesia: Rebirth, and – more importantly – SOMA.

The VR update does allow for that, but now there is a mod for those that don't have a headset but still want a first-person RE4 experience.\n\n\nAs noted by PCGamer, Nexus Mods user elsuperaguas has released the beta version of a mod for Resident Evil 4 that switches the perspective. Now, without having to use the PSVR 2, you can play last year's remake in glorious first-person.\n\n\n\n\nA recent video from the YouTube channel Residence of Evil shows it in action. It's as you would expect, bringing RE4 more in-line with the seventh and eighth installments in Capcom's iconic survival horror series.\n\n\nEven Leon's curtains don't get in the way\n\n\nThere are some things you might want to take into account before you install the mod, however. On the download page, elsuperaguas says you will need to install a few things before you can play RE4 in first-person.\n\n\nThose things are:\n\n\n\n1. \"Headless Leon\" mod so you don't see inside Leon's head.\n2. \"Laser for every handgun\" to fix the misalign of the laser beam.\n3. \"Invisible Weird Headgears\" so you don't see the accessories.\n\n\n\n\nYou can also install \"Headless Main Characters\" if you want to play as Ashley or the Mercenaries content. Once all that's done, you should be good to go.\n\n\nUnsurprisingly, we declared Resident Evil 4 the best remake/remaster of 2023. Much like the modern takes on RE2 and RE3, Capcom did a fantastic job of making the classic game feel fresh without losing what made the original highly praised special.\n\nThe post You can now play Resident Evil 4 Remake in first-person with this mod appeared first on Destructoid.",

The developers warn that there's a possibility that it can permanently reduce one's capture power. \n\n\nScreenshot from Pocketpair's Discord\n\n\nPocketpair says it's investigating this issue and advises players to refrain from, uh, doing drugs until they fix this issue. \n\n\nThe developers don't specify exactly how much of your capture power will go down if this bug knocks on your door, but we have to assume your capture abilities will take a non-negligible hit. This sucks, especially if you've already committed to using these, but as far as release bugs go, it could've been much worse. \n\n\nPalworld has hit Steam and the Xbox Game Pass like a meteor — one of those from sci-fi tales that come full of wacky alien lifeforms. After not even 24 hours out, the Pokémon-inspired title was already doing numbers high to the point of dwarfing recent mega-hits such as Lethal Company. \n\n\nSome Pokémon fans have been pretty vocal in accusing Palworld of being nothing more than an edgy clone, but whether or not you care for it, I find it very hard to ignore all of the awesome — albeit sometimes questionable — things that this new title brings to the table.\n\n\nAs for this bug, it's completely natural for issues such as this to hit a game on launch, and it's expected that it'll get fixed soon. \n\n\nYou can now capture cute animals and even human NPCs on Steam and the Xbox Game Pass.\n\nThe post Palworld devs warn about “impossible to recover from” bug appeared first on Destructoid.",

First <a href=\"https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/08/12/frostpunk-2-is-coming-and-it-takes-place-decades-after-the-original\">announced</a> in August 2021, the sequel to the bleak yet popular city-builder is also coming to Xbox and PC Game Pass.</p>\n\n<p>The trailer provides a look at how decision-making appears in-game. The demands you’ll receive from your citizens appear to be as stressful as the first Frostpunk, as you control a Steward overseeing life in a city situated in an unforgiving tundra where resources are precious and everyone has their own ideas about how society should function. How do you ensure everyone gets fed? What does the education system look like? How do you keep the streets clean of literal and criminal filth? Set 30 years after the original game, citizens can vote to pass laws, and these decisions steer the city’s direction toward multiple outcomes and finales.</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameBorder=\"0\"  allow=\"autoplay\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PWlLOpqIYjA\" width=\"640\"></iframe>\n\n<p>11 Bit also announced that Frostpunk 2 is launching on PC Game Pass, alongside Steam, The Epic Store, and GOG, in the first half of 2024. The game will also come to Game Pass on Xbox Series X/S at a later date and is targeting PlayStation 5 as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>You can read our review of the first Frostpunk <a href=\"https://www.gameinformer.com/games/frostpunk/b/pc/archive/2018/04/23/frostpunk-review-a-frigid-unrelenting-survival-success.aspx\">here</a>.</p>",

The team revealed its first project would be, unsurprisingly, an RPG, and today, we learned a couple more details about the game, including its title.</p>\n\n<p>The game is called Dawnwalker, and Rebel Wolves describes it as a “story-driven dark fantasy role-playing adventure.” Billed as being the team's dream RPG project, the game has officially entered the alpha stage of development, and Rebel Wolves plans to share more information about it later this year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The studio also announced another CD Projekt alumni Mateusz Tomaszkiewicz as the game’s creative director. Tomaszkiewicz work includes Cyberpunk 2077, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, and Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales.</p>\n\n<p>“We want to craft a world that you will want to explore and dive deep into and tell stories that make you care about the characters,” said Tomaszkiewicz in a press release. “We aim to deliver an experience that will allow for a variety of choices and room for experimentation when replayed. Helping craft this experience with so many talented people will be my mission at Rebel Wolves, and I can't wait for everyone to see what the team has been up to for quite a while now.”</p>\n\n<p>Rebel Wolves didn’t share any more info on Dawnwalker, so questions about its premise, narrative, mechanics, and platforms will go unanswered until hopefully later this year. Until then, the team did release a piece of promotional art, posted above, that should help fuel imaginations of what the team is cooking.</p>",

The publisher also confirmed that long-time favorite Eddy Gordo will kick off the roster of Season 1 DLC fighters.</p>\n\n<p>The intro cinematic is impressively rendered and, in true Tekken fashion, utterly absurd. In addition to seeing the main cast throwdown with implausible displays of martial arts, we even see them engage in a full-on battle reminiscent of the Wakanda fight in <em>Avengers: Infinity War</em>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameBorder=\"0\"  allow=\"autoplay\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fzqvmFrV46c\" width=\"640\"></iframe>\n\n<p>The video concludes with the reveal that Eddy Gordo is joining the roster this spring. Since his first appearance in Tekken 3, Eddy has been both beloved and reviled for his extremely effective use of Capoeira, so we're excited to see new tricks he has up his sleeves.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In a neat behind-the-scenes twist, the trailer shows off some of the motion capture and animation that went into bringing Eddy into the current generation of Tekken. Eddy is the first of four characters that will be added to Tekken 8 throughout the year for purchasers of the Year 1 Season Pass or owners of the Deluxe, Ultimate, or Collector's Editions of the game in which the pass is included.</p>\n\n<p>Tekken 8 launches on January 26 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.
