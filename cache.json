          "description": "Stuck between a rock and a global chip shortage.\nNintendo's report for the 2021/22 financial year dropped today, and while Switch continues to sell well and software sales are looking healthy, signs that enthusiasm for the five-year-old system is beginning to ebb are also apparent. To be clear, the results present a far from gloomy outlook for the console and company, but the numbers show a year-on-year sales decline of 20% and the company forecasts further drops for the coming year.\nIn real numbers, lifetime Switch sales now stand at 107.65 million units, with just over 23 million of those coming in the last year. That's a very sturdy figure — and sell-through (meaning the number of units actually sold to consumers at retail, as opposed to the number shipped to retail outlets) of the console in the last financial year is second only to the console's launch year. Digital sales increased 4.5% over FY 2021, too, with the January-March '22 period recording the second-highest digital sales quarter ever — just shy of the preceding lucrative Holiday '21 season. It's certainly not all doom and gloom in Kyoto right now.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The headline part of the broadcast was the flashy new trailer (above) that set the scene for some further details.\nAn announcement that stood out to us related to Sunbreak having all-new 'Follower Quests'; these are single-player only and involve you heading into battle accompanied by story characters. They'll pitch in and help, with each having distinct fighting styles; they'll even behave like human players and ride monsters, for example. It seems like an enjoyable way to experience some extra storytelling, and in addition to follower quests with characters from the new Sunbreak hub (Elgado), there'll also be some of these with Kamura residents from the base game, such as Hinoa and Minoto.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It's described as a cross between Alice in Wonderland, Monkey Island, and Hey Arnold!, so if you're a fan of the classic Nickelodeon cartoon, this might be one to keep an eye on.\nIn an effort to make the game as inclusive as possible, the developer has opted to exclude spoken words, instead using actions and visuals to communicate instructions to the player along with the narrative.

Shooting for a Q4 2022 release, this 3+ hour documentary is all about the genre's rise. Ahead of its release later this year, CREATORVC has shared a six-minute snippet with IGN which looks at how id Software first decided to make its first FPS and one of the most pioneering and influential games of all time, Wolfenstein 3D.\nAnyone who knows anything about Wolfenstein 3D knows that on its native DOS it's bloody and brutal, which wasn't exactly a perfect fit for Nintendo at the time. Still, because the game was such a hit, Japanese company Imagineer contacted id Software to make a Super Nintendo port of the game. And Nintendo was less than happy with the violent content of the shooter.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "One of my biggest highlights from PAX East a couple of weeks ago was attending Shirley Curry, aka: Skyrim Grandma's panel about her roleplaying adventures in Bethesda's enormous RPG. Despite suffering a stroke just a couple of months beforehand, the 85-year-old YouTuber was on fine form during her PAX East panel, speaking to a packed out theatre of fans and viewers who have spent the better part of six years following her various playthroughs through Skyrim as a multitude of different characters. She talked briefly about her writing and character creation process for her Let's Play-style videos, before spending a whopping 45 minutes answering questions from the audience. These covered everything from her favourite things in Skyrim to her favourite, real-life candy, and also included a surprising number of horror game recommendations. In her own words, she loves stuff that's \"weird and creepy\", and has recently been looking for something new to play. \"I’d really like to play a dark, scary game,\" she said, and the audience were only too happy to oblige. \nIt was a truly wonderful way to spend a Saturday afternoon, and as soon as it was over, both Liam and I knew it was too good not to share. Here's a written transcript of the entire audience Q&A in full, plus a summary of her opening speech, for your reading pleasure. \nRead more",

They're asking $810 for the graphics card after a $30 rebate, some $450 below the GPU's ludicrously high MSRP.

          "description": "Salt And Sacrifice is a 2D metroidvania hunt-a-thon that casts you as a condemned prisoner in an imperiled kingdom. Magic is corrupting the land, giving rise to monstrous creatures and ravenous undead, and the source of all of this destruction, Mages, must be hunted and their hearts devoured if the Kingdom is to survive. Like Ska Studios’s previous outing, the game features difficult combat, extensive equipment options, and hulking bosses to slay. But while the scale has increased and the combat and visuals are as slick as ever, there are some growing pains that only just manage to hold the game back from its full potential.\nUpon booting the game up, it’s immediately clear that you’re in for a visual treat.The design and detail are just ever so lovely: from the way firelight gives a soft glow to its surroundings in the twilight, to how fog wafts lazily over cobble stairways in a musty dungeon, it’s all just so utterly gorgeous to look at. Ska Studios have always had a recognizable art style – imposing architecture and grungy moppets – but it’s plain to see here that they’ve upped their game in the best possible way. According to the devs, every asset was created from scratch, and that care shows in every frame.\nRead more",

          "description": "I spent much of my childhood hunkered around the family PC using an emulator to run Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Arcade Game. Years have passed since I last played, causing the vague memories to distort into a recollection that’s nothing like reality. In my head, that first arcade game captured the frenetic energy of the TMNT cartoons I’d watch on a Saturday morning. The reality was quite different, with the turtles awkwardly bumbling through Manhattan while occasionally smacking an enemy.\nThat realisation has never been more apparent than after playing the first two levels of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge, a successor to those early beat ‘em up TMNT arcade games being developed by Tribute Games and published by DotEmu. It captures the aesthetic of those childhood memories and makes them a reality, which is a testament to Tribute Games’ understanding of TMNT as a brand. But it also feels far too familiar, failing to substantially innovate on the original formula.\nRead more",

Or you can just figure out which one is your favourite, and keep it on forever more. \nThe Naga Trinity's UK RRP is £110, but it normally goes for about £70 or £80.

It took me around 12 hours of playing the game to travel around a strange cuboid planet using postage stamps to fix hairdryers for robots, but stretched over three months in real life. And reviewing a game this many weeks after release isn't normal procedure either, but I really like FixFox and I want people who might like it to stand a better chance of finding it.

To say I'm overprotective is an understatement. \nThankfully, the Grey Knights in Warhammer 40K: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters are made of sterner stuff. I mean, just look at these brutes. They're enormous. Even the Gears Of War lads would be jealous of the kind of muscle these big robo boys are packing, I'm telling you now. They're by no means invincible, of course, but they can hold their own out of cover, and pick themselves back up again when your best laid plans inevitably start going down the drain.

That's a fantastic deal for a comfy mouse with 11 programmable buttons, adjustable weights and an 'infinite' scroll wheel. \nIf you prefer your mice with more batteries and fewer cables, the wireless G502 Lightspeed is also discounted heavily, from £129.99 to £57.99. I reckon that's strong value for a mouse that remains comfy, high-spec and fully-featured, while adding on Logitech's industry-leading wireless tech. The wireless mouse is also much less frequently discounted than its predecessor, which does tend to see a price drop in line with the major 'shopping holidays' of the year. \nRead more",

Lauren played the demo a few months back and found it to be lovely, and indeed, what's not to love about a pretty 2D world where you potter about and plant things, and trade things with different anthropomorphic animals that wander through. There's a slightly chonkier preview build knocking about now, and I'll say this for it: you need to put the time in.\nThere's more to say as well, but that was my main takeaway from the current build. Much like actual gardening, a lot of The Garden Path is inscrutable to me - at least from the visits I've made to the garden so far, which is actually more of a free-form forest at present. Presumably after some effort on my part I can shape it how I'd like. But if current trends hold that will take a long time. Cos plants.\nRead more",

With their latest game, The Gunk, they've finally entered the realm of 3D adventure games. Released on Xbox Game Pass at the tail end of last year, The Gunk was a big step up for the makers of SteamWorld Dig. Not only was it their first game in 3D, and their first time using a new engine, but it was also their first title that had nothing to do with the series they'd built their name on. As it makes its way to Steam today, I sat down with director Ulf Hartelius to talk more about the creation of the game's titular goop, and how the timing of its environmental themes about cleaning up its gunked up planet was much more than just a Death Stranding-style happy accident. \nRead more",

Games Montreal released a 13-minute video that delivers a deep look at Gotham Knights' combat, city exploration, suit customization, and the differences between protagonists Nightwing and Red Hood. I walked away from this footage with mixed feelings yet still plenty of excitement for the game's October 25 release.\nFirst, let's start with a positive: It has plenty of the Arkham formula in its coding. The flow of combat, the density of the open world, and the overall dark vibe align nicely with the Arkham series, which this Montreal studio had a hand in with Arkham Origins. Now, the bad: It also reminded me of Crystal Dynamics' Marvel's Avengers game – solely based on the sheer amount of items needed to craft suits and powers.

I had seen some buzz about it online and figured I’d give it a go – it was on Xbox Game Pass, after all, and the key art looked precisely the slick and punchy cyberpunk/sci-fi aesthetic I especially like. Little did I know, a few hours later, I’d be playing a game that I’d recommend to anyone at this point. \nNow, I’m about four hours in, and there’s the potential to crash and burn, but something tells me it’s not going to. Citizen Sleeper, as a game, is somewhat hard to explain: It’s a sci-fi, narrative RPG with no combat (at least so far), a dice-rolling mechanic that dictates everything, minor survival systems, and a rotating cast of characters that you’ll immediately want more of upon meeting them.

Rising up from quirky Scotland-based developers with a taste for pulp and crime fiction, Rockstar evolved radically, shifting into innovators and provocateurs, creating some of the industry's most influential and blockbuster titles. In the lead up to the eagerly anticipated Red Dead Redemption 2, we came together as a staff to rank every single game that Rockstar developed (this means we excluded published titles like L.A. Noire and Smuggler's Run). From the humble top-down beginnings of Grand Theft Auto to the blood-soaked streets of Manhunt and the beautiful jaw-dropping vistas of Red Dead Redemption, you’ll find every single title put in its proper place in terms of influence, importance of innovation, and just plain fun.\nWith all that in mind, let’s steal a ride and roar down this road to hell.

That’s why it’s been understandably boxed into the fighting/simulation genre. Outside of a few collectible card games and general manager sims, the genre has rarely strayed beyond its competitive roots, and I think that’s a shame. Wrestling can offer so much more to video games. \nThe upcoming WrestleQuest is a great example of what you can do with wrestling games if you apply a bit of creativity. The title transforms the core concepts of the sport into a 16-bit RPG inspired by games like Final Fantasy VI and Chrono Trigger. It’s such a refreshing idea, and I can’t wait to see how it turns out when it launches later this year. WWE re…",

          "description": "After nearly 30 years of partnership, EA Sports and FIFA, the international governing body of association football, are parting ways after the release of this year's soccer video game. The announcement comes from a blog post from Electronic Arts that reveals what's next for the footie franchise.\nWith the current deal dissolving in 2023, EA will no longer use the FIFA name on its popular football series but will instead adopt the moniker of EA Sports FC. It's shedding any licensed identity in the name but still keeping many of its deals with existing football clubs and players. Cam Weber, General Manager of EA Sports, writes in the blog post, \"Everything you love about our games will be part of EA Sports FC – the same great experiences, modes, leagues, tournaments, clubs, and athletes will be there.\" \nOutside of potentially losing the use of the World Cup tournament, it's unclear what else might be missing in future iterations. However, EA is still boasting impressive numbers of players and teams involved moving forward.\nOur unique licensing portfolio of more than 19,000+ players, 700+ teams, 100+ stadiums, and 30 leagues that we’ve continued to invest in for decades will still be there, uniquely in EA Sports FC,\" says Weber. \"That includes exclusive partnerships with the Premier League, LaLiga, Bundesliga, Serie A, the MLS – and more to come.\"\nThis year's FIFA 23 sounds like it will be business as usual with more features, World Cup content, leagues, clubs, and more and won't be subject to any of these changes. Weber says that we'll have to wait until summer 2023 to hear more of what's to come for EA Sports FC.\nHow do you feel about this change in branding and partnership? Is FIFA just a name to you, or does it bring something special to EA's brand of virtual soccer? Let us know in the comments below!",

However, I was hit with reality: he doesn’t yet have his own video game, and that’s a shame. \nSure, he’s appeared in franchises like Marvel Ultimate Alliance, Marvel vs. Capcom, and more – he’s even set to be one of the main protagonists in the upcoming Marvel’s Midnight Suns due out later this year – but if you want to experience a Strange-centric story akin to something like Insomniac’s Marvel’s Spider-Man, you’re out of luck.

Respawn Entertainment, the development studio behind the Jedi title, is overseeing production for three different Star Wars games: a strategy title, a first-person shooter, and a sequel to Jedi.\nI don't know what to expect from the first two games, but I expect Jedi to be a direct sequel that reunites fans with protagonist Cal Kestis, who is still trying to find his place in a troubled time with the Empire on the rise. If Respawn goes in this direction, here's what I hope to see:\nThe Light and Dark Side of the Force\nForce Turmoil\nA Gruesome Death for the Poncho\nPlay as BD-1\nLarger Environments\nMore of the Same with the Lightsaber and Fighting\nA Connection to The Mandalorian\nThe Mandalorian show, but I didn't expect to see one from Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. Star Wars fans believe BD-1 was in the show, meaning he's been around for over twenty years. How awesome would it be to see BD-1 return to that location and show us why he was there in the first place?\nAnd now I'd like to hear what you want to see from Respawn's next Jedi game? Do you want Cal back? Would you rather have someone else in his place? If so, who? Also, if he does return, where do you think his story goes?",

          "description": "The original Mass Effect trilogy is one of gaming's most celebrated epics, despite the controversial finale of the third chapter. Depending on players' choices, the fate of legendary protagonist Commander Shepard was either ambiguously hopeful or dismally tragic. Mass Effect Andromeda moved away from a Shepard-led story, and players have been eagerly awaiting any news about the next numbered installment. A Mass Effect 4 trailer dropped during the 2020 Game Awards and revealed everyone's favorite Asari Shadow Broker. And now, a new lithograph might be hinting at the return of the illustrious Commander. \nAccording to a VGC report, the initial description of a Mass Effect lithograph says it all: \"While Shepard and the survivors are left to pick up the pieces, fans are left wondering what’s next.\" YouTuber MrHulthen noted that the text was quickly swapped out for something less direct. It now reads, \"The threat of the Reapers might have been ended, but at great cost including Earth itself. While the survivors are left to pick up the pieces, fans are left wondering what’s next.\" Read the whole thing for yourself by clicking the link above. Could this sudden change mean that the Commander is coming back? Only time will tell, as Mass Effect 4 narrative details have been particularly scarce. \n\n\nOf course, BioWare isn't only working on its famed space opera. The next adventure in its high fantasy RPG franchise, Dragon Age, is on the way too. Similarly, story info for that game is few and far between, but excitement for both series couldn't possibly be higher. \n[Source: VGC]\nWould you like to star as Commander Shepard again?

          "description": "2011’s Duke Nukem Forever famously languished in development hell for 15 years before release. Its tumultuous cycle, which began in 1997, spawned several builds and demos by original developer 3D Realms. Today, footage of one of those early versions of the game has appeared online.\nAs spotted by GameSpot, a 4Chan user known as x0r uploaded footage of a 1-minute, 20-second slice of gameplay from a 2001 demo of the game. The video’s authenticity was semi-confirmed on Twitter by Duke Nukem co-creator George Broussard, who served as one of the lead designers on Forever with 3D Realms during its long development. According to Broussard, he has no idea how the footage resurfaced but shot down hopes of a complete, playable build by describing these demos as a “smattering of barely populated test …",

From felling legends to taunting invaders, running around in Elden Ring with trusted pals never gets bland. And while many swear that From Software’s trial by fire loop is most rewarding when experienced solo, I’d argue the exact opposite. Boss fight difficulty is scaled to match party size, leading to more laughs and terror. Minions peppered throughout the world pack an exhilarating punch but are less frustrating to surmount. And dropping items for others makes character progression devilishly dynamic (my three Moonveils are a testament to this). \nBut somehow, multiplayer still feels like an afterthought. \nFrom Software’s PVE and PVP entail assisting so…",

          "description": "It's been 4525 days since James Cameron's Avatar was released in theaters, decimating box office records, and today, the trailer for its first of many sequels dropped online. \nAvatar: The Way of Water rejoins Jake Sully (in his now permanent Na'vi body) and his partner Neytiri over a decade after the first film's events. According to the film's description, the two now have a family with kids of their own, and The Way of Water is the first of many new stories to chronicle \"the trouble that follows them, the lengths they go to keep each other safe, the battles they fight to stay alive, and the tragedies they endure.\" Previously we got to see how the Na'vi live and thrive in the lush jungles on the planet of Pandora. This time we see how they fare on the coast, in the oceans, and of course, in the skies above it. The humans are still around, too, and look to be up to no good with armed Na'vi or Avatars in their ranks.\nThe trailer, which you can watch above, has plenty of grandeur, drama, and action. It brings back memories of how gorgeous the setting of Avatar is, and the last shot of the trailer shows Cameron hasn't forgotten how to make a cool action sequence. He is responsible for Terminator 2 and Aliens, after all. If I wasn't sold on the idea of more Avatar before the trailer, seeing Jake surf into the skies on a flying crocodile with a huge gun in hand and an ax on his back was more than enough for me to buy a ticket when presales go live later this year. \nAvatar: The Way of Water stars Zoe Saldana, Sam Worthington, Sigourney Weaver, Stephen Lang, Cliff Curtis, Joel David Moore, CCH Pounder, Edie Falco, Jemaine Clement, and Kate Winslet. It will be released in theaters on December 16, and yes, there will be a 3D version.\nAre you excited about Avatar: The Way of Water? Did you remember that Ubisoft is working on an Avatar game set for release this year? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below!",

Critically, it’s been more divisive than one might guess, with many either being put off by how \"Sam Raimi\" the Doctor Strange sequel is or completely smitten with it as a result of the Evil Dead director’s style. \nIf you’ve seen the movie, you’ve likely noticed how unique it is in the pantheon of Marvel Cinematic Universe movies.

In lieu of a full review before the game launches, I present my initial impressions of Salt and Sacrifice, which are decidedly mixed after a dozen hours of hunting Mages.\nFollowing its predecessor's footsteps, Salt and Sacrifice hits a similar 2D Soulslike feel. After perishing in the opening moments, your character becomes Spellmarked, an entity that treads the line between life and death by the power of magic.

Unfortunately for them, that will soon come to an end. \nThe WWE Games Twitter account tweeted that on June 30, the online functions for both of those games will be shut down. 2K explains that doing so allows the team to give its full attention to supporting 2K22. Once the shutdown occurs, 2K19/20 players will be unable to play online, download/upload user-created content, or interact with presumably any other feature dependant on the servers.   \n📣 Attention WWE 2K community: On June 30, 2022, we will sunset support for WWE 2K19 & WWE 2K20 servers. This includes all online functions, such as online matches & Community Creations. We are turning our full focus toward supporting #WWE2K22. Thanks for your continued support! pic.twitter.com/vOJ06AA9iy\nMay 9, 2022\nWhile 2K20 is largely remembered as a disaster, 2K19 was generally well-liked, but both games haven’t exactly maintained bustling online communities. The average Steam player count for both games currently sits between 90-130 players, so it’s easy to understand why 2K would feel justified in sunsetting online support.\nFurthermore, WWE 2K22 garnered positive reviews (here's ours) and recently received the first pack of DLC wrestlers of its months-long roadmap. On paper, it behooves the team to bolster a game perceived as a relative return to form with updates as much as it can. It's undeniably a bummer to lose such a big function of the old titles for preservation purposes, if nothing else, but at least fans have plenty of time to squeeze in some online match-ups before the final bell tolls.",

          "description": "Gotham Knights might feature four-player co-op, if an updated PlayStation Network Store listing for the game is to be believed. \nGotham Knights, which lets players control either Nightwing, Batgirl, Robin, or Red Hood in a Gotham without its Batman, has marketed co-op as a feature since its reveal back in 2020. However, its co-op only supported up to two players. It seems that developer Warner Bros. Montreal, the studio behind Batman Arkham: Origins, might be looking to bump that number up. That’s because a new PSN listing for Gotham Knights lists the game as having four-player co-op, as reported by PCGamesN. \nAs you can see in the screenshot above (taken by Game Informer this morning), PlayStation lists the game as one that “supports up to 4 online players with PS Plus.” It even features the symbol and wording for “4 network players” beside that, further supporting the claim that Gotham Knights might feature four-player online co-op. However, as PCGamesN notes, the description for the game still says Gotham Knights can be experienced “in solo-play or with one other hero,” which sounds a lot like two-player co-op. \nPerhaps Warner Bros. Montreal has a surprise announcement up its sleeve, or maybe it is developing a mode separate from the campaign that supports four-player co-op. Only time will tell. \nFor more, check out this Gotham Knights gameplay walkthrough and then watch the latest trailer for Gotham Knights, which highlights the control of the Court of Owls. Read about how Gotham Knights was delayed to October after that. \n[Source: PCGamesN]\nDo you want four-player co-op in Gotham Knights? Let us know in the comments below!",

          "description": "Hearthstone Battlegrounds is but a few days away from a major shakeup. On May 10, Blizzard will be releasing pats 23.2, which includes the significant Rise of the Naga update for Hearthstone's auto battler. With it comes a new hero, Queen Azshara, and a brand new minion keyword called Spellcraft that gives the player temporary spells out of thin air each turn to buff their team of minions. \nSpeaking of minions, a new race of creatures will be coming with Rise of the Naga, and it will, of course, be the Naga themselves joining the fray. No longer will the Murlocs be the only amphibians making their presence known in the Battlegrounds. In total, Rise of the Naga will add 23 minions to the Battlegrounds pool of cards, all of which you can gaze upon below. \n\nSince Naga are the new hotness in Battlegrounds, that tribe will be receiving the most support, with 16 total Naga being added to the game. They'll mostly be the cards embued with Spellcraft, although there is one non-Naga with the ability. Five more minions of other types are joining the card pool as brand new minions, and two familiar faces will be making a return to the format. However, with all of these additions, there are going to be some subtractions; five minions will be retired from Battlegrounds as soon as patch 23.2 hits on Tuesday.\nHow much do you think the Naga will change the meta of Hearthstone Battlegrounds? Are you excited to play around with the Spellcraft mechanic? Let us know your thoughts on this big update in the comments below!",

We got a small taste of her next adventure in a 12-page short story in the comic book Skybound X, and now, if you run out to your comic book store today, you can see what happens next for absolutely free.  Each year, retailers celebrate Free Comic Book Day by giving away dozens of comic books from various publishers for free. One of this year's books is Clementine: Issue One by publisher Skybound Comet and Eisner and Ignatz award-winning writer and artist Tillie Walden.\nThis free book is surprisingly lengthy, giving readers 27 pages of Clementine's next story, as well as an interview with Walden. This story leads into Clementine: Book One, a graphic novel that releases in June. Here's the official product listing from Skybound for the forthcoming book:\nClementine is back on the road, looking to put her traumatic past behind her and forge new path all her own.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n      \n            \n\n\n      \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you run out to your comic shop today, make sure you also grab Marvels Judgement Day and Spider-Man/Venom, as well as DC's Dark Crisis.

This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66. After he’s outed by the Sith, he embarks on a quest to recover an artifact capable of locating force-sensitive children while also avoiding capture by the Inquisitors, who are elite Jedi hunters. \nThe game features a blend of lightsaber combat and a suite of Force abilities. Borrowing inspiration from FromSoftware’s Soul series, encounters are challenging, requiring a strategic blend of blocks and parries to outduel opponents. Meanwhile, the various planets take on a Metroid-inspired progression with players unlocking abilities to backtrack to previously inaccessible areas. \nWatch on Twitch!\nFallen Order was released on November 15, 2019, and was a critical and financial success. It also served as a saving grace for single-player fans, providing proof to an increasingly multiplayer-focused EA that linear story-driven experiences can still make the big bucks. With a sequel reportedly in the works, we’re revisiting this gem of the Star Wars video game pantheon. \nJoin Marcus Stewart, Andrew Reiner, and Jill Grodt on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central as we journey through the entirety of Cal Kestis’ adventure. Expect plenty of laughs, deaths, and general nerding out over all things Star Wars. We encourage you to hang out with us in chat.

The bundle, which will cost you $65, includes a Grookey plush, of course, with a sound chip that includes the Pokémon’s cry, a matching “Leaf Shirt,” and a “Leaf Cape.” It’s basically a Grookey plush with a Hawaiian shirt on, and it looks awesome. \n“Get into the groove with Grookey,” the site’s description of this bundle reads. “This friendly Pokémon is sure to always stick by your side. The curious Grookey is a Grass-type Pokémon with green fur, large eyes and ears, and a curly brown tail. Pokémon trainers will love this exclusive Grookey plush toy bundle, which includes Grookey’s leaf print shirt, matching cape, and 5-in-1 sound chip.” \nThere’s a limit of five of these bundles per customer, if you want to get close to having a full team of Grookey plushes, and Grookey as a plush cannot be purchased individually. If you want the plush, you have to buy the bundle online that includes the shirt, cape, and sound chip. \nAs previously mentioned, Grookey is very much the best starter in Pokémon Sword and Shield, and you can read our thoughts on those games in Game Informer’s Pokémon Sword and Shield review. After that, read about Gen 9, which was recently revealed as Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet.
