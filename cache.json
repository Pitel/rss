The Pokémon Scarlet and Violet OLED Model only accounted for around 8% of total console sales, though it's clear that the launch of the latest Pokémon generation gave the Switch family a significant boost with UK audiences overall.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

In Sword and Shield, many people speculated that the wallpaper in Hotel Ionia, emblazoned with oranges and grapes, was a subtle hint at the orange/grape theming of Scarlet and Violet. Likewise, the Diamond and Pearl remakes at the end of 2021 had some scarlet and violet flowers that seemed a little too purposeful to be an accident.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

And that's why Inscryption's arrival on Switch is such a treat: as the first of Mullins' games to hit the console, many Switch owners won’t have had the chance to play his earlier works. If you’re one of them, you’re in for a treat.\nThe Switch home screen icon for Inscryption is a 3.5-inch floppy disk. The game loads with a flickery CRT filter over the production logos and then frames the whole work as a dusty old computer game that hasn't been played in a long time. That game is a card game, played against a mysterious Dungeon Master-type figure. However, within minutes, it becomes apparent that your eerie foe isn't talking to you, the player of the computer game, but to an in-game avatar who is playing the card game inside the computer game. So before you’ve even sat comfortably, Inscryption has you playing a game within a game within a game.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Today is one of those days, as it turns out The Lord Of The Rings: The Return of The King was built using the modified engine of an undisclosed Tiger Woods title. \n\"Lord Of The Rings is about large areas, then a castle at the end or a fortress - what's like that?\", asks Callisto Protocol director Glen Schofield in the video below. \"Tiger Woods\", he answers. \r\n\r\nHuh.\n\n\n Read more",

Overwatch 2 may have marked the beginning of a slightly jarring shift towards the free-to-play model for Blizzard's venerable hero shooter, but it's the release of Season 2 where players will get their first taste of the pace and quality at which future content will be released under the new regime.\nI got to spend a few days exploring the new changes that Overwatch 2's second season will bring around this time tomorrow, and I've come away feeling a little torn. On the one hand, the brand new additions - the new Tank, Ramattra, and the new Shambali Monastery map - are gorgeous, intriguing, and enjoyable. On the other, the balance changes to existing heroes really don't seem to have done much to rebalance the most overpowered heroes in the game, which has left me feeling a bit frustrated.\n Read more",

The news comes from the New York Post, who quote former FTC chairman William Kovacic as saying the deal is 70% likely to proceed. \nThere's a web of politics involved, but the short version is that insider sources say Microsoft have won over another member of the four person FTC panel, meaning any vote on whether to launch a lawsuit would result in an even split that would effectively OK the deal. That would reduce current FTC Chair Lina Khan's authority over the body, so to avoid that she might just let Microsoft have at it. \n\n \nRead more",

It’s not that all the separate parts go badly together, having chocolate jazzies and cola bottles all jumbled in together is exactly what I want. The problem is that it can’t possibly live up to what you hoped for when you’re scooping treats into that weighty paper bag. There’s a surprise chalkiness in the chocolates, some of the gummies are glued together, and in your haste, you’ve nabbed two lookalike sweets and mismanaged your expectations. At a glance, it’s precisely the rainbow-coloured jumble you wanted, but often it just leaves a bad taste in your mouth.\nKynseed is an RPG, and a life sim, and a sandbox. It is also Cooking Mama, and Moonlighter, and a dungeon crawler. It is gentle vibes ASMR relax-and-watch-the-seasons-change, and also crass and knowingly subversive. It does some of these things excellently, while other parts just don’t hold up.\nRead more",

They revolve around people pulling out cards that suddenly give them extra power or abilities, with counterplays almost entirely dependent on whether you happen to draw the right card in response. Munchkin is the king of these, at least in terms of popularity, having sent millions of players all over the world into dungeons where they competitively slay goofy horrors. \r\n\r\nI cannot stand it, but it is now on Steam in early access, and statistically speaking a lot of people will be very happy about that. \n\n Read more",

I'm about halfway through its campaign at the moment, but the rhythm of calling up replacements and reinforcing my squads hasn't quite been engrained into my hotkey fingers yet. I keep making the mistake of thinking I can just push through with my remaining forces, but as any COH stalwart will know, that kind of road only ever leads to total disaster. \nImagine my surprise, then, when I came to preview the latest build of Company Of Heroes 3's dynamic, Total War-style Italian campaign and seemed to be, you know, actually making some pretty steady progress as I pushed up its mission maps. I was, admittedly, only playing the opening levels of this particular campaign, and I also had the aid of a handy M4A1 Sherman tank providing some welcome backup muscle. But during my four hours with it, I felt more in control of the battlefield than I've ever done while playing COH2. I was making excellent use of its reinforcement options, and heck, I was even remembering to tell units to retreat back to the nearest aid post so I didn’t lose the buffs they'd earned through their new EXP-driven promotions and veterancy bonuses. Then I played a mission from its more linear North African campaign, and had a very rude awakening indeed. Why, hello, frantic pressure and torrents of death bullets from Company Of Heroes 2 again, it's been a while.\nRead more",

While many love Company Of Heroes for its top notch campaigns, Littman told me they \"still have over 400,000 players still playing COH 1 and 2 monthly\" via multiplayer, which is impressive considering the last game in the series came out nine years ago.

          "description": "For the last ten years, the XCOM designers at Firaxis have traded in 'if's and 'maybe's. If this shot lands, then maybe I can pull off this carefully calculated plan I’m brewing. It's exactly the kind of taut, knife-edge tension we've come to love and expect from their turn-based strategy games, but Marvel's Midnight Suns takes a different approach. As the titular demon hunters join forces with some famous Avengers faces to take down the evil sorceress Lilith and Marvel mega villain Chthon, there's never any question about whether your moves will or won't work here. You're playing as the world's most powerful superheroes. Of course, they’re going to work. And forget about cowering behind knee-high cover walls, too, because if you're not already bulletproof, you've certainly got the reflexes and supercharged muscle mass to soak up anything Lilith’s Hydra minions are going to chuck at you.\r\n\nQuestion is, by tipping the power scales in your favour like this, do you risk destroying that delicate balance of risk and reward? At first glance, it's easy to think a more reliable set of heroes would end up dulling what made Firaxis' XCOM games so special, but the result is something equally thrilling. Given how the Marvel machine has drawn in and chewed up so much singular creative talent in the wider MCUniverse, Firaxis emerging with their cred intact is nothing short of extraordinary. Not only have they endured their radioactive spider bite, they've come out bigger and better for it, creating not only the best Marvel game I've played, but one of the best superhero games full stop.\nRead more",

          "description": "Somewhere in the region of 8,000 games have been removed from Steam since its inception, from the mass banning of “fake games”, to publishers removing their own titles due to licensing disputes, pending re-releases, personal disillusionment, server shutdowns and political scandals. Valve even took down one of its own games. Released in 2004 with Steam AppID 92, Codename: Gordon is a Flash-based 2D side-scroller set in the Half-Life universe, developed by Nuclearvision and published by Valve. It was removed due to a hard-coded link to the now-defunct developer’s domain, which Valve regarded as a security risk.\nBut removed isn’t always the same as gone, and exploring Steam’s deleted items is an adventure through modern gaming history. I spoke to some developers of delisted games to find out more.\nRead more",

I'm not a big kid person, typically, but you'd have to be beyond heartless not to love little Clem, wouldn't you?

          "description": "Card-based strategy games seem to have really found their feet over the last 12 months. Now that we're a few years clear of Slay The Spire's chokehold over the genre, deckbuilders are starting to come thick and fast in a variety of exciting mash-ups. This year alone, I've sunk a hefty number of hours into the deckbuilding tower defence 'em up ORX, got lost in the tabletop plots of Foretales, and later this week we'll see the launch of Marvel's Midnight Suns, the new card-based strategy RPG from XCOM makers Firaxis. It's a good time to be a fan of deckbuilders, is what I'm saying, and early next year the mythological exploits of Mahokenshi will be looking to carry the baton forward into 2023. \nMade by the Paris-based Game Source Studio, this turn-based strategy battler sees you take control of four types of samurai as you seek to bring balance to a mystical realm above the clouds. Oni, goblins and other creatures from Japanese myth are your primary antagonists here, but its hexagonal islands are also stuffed full of text-based narrative events, sidequests, and treasure troves to uncover. It's a lot to take in, but the latter in particular are vital to your success. That's because every time you start a new mission in Mahokenshi, you'll be going in with a completely fresh deck - and based on an early preview build I've been playing recently, it's both an ingenious way to keep things feeling fresh, but it can also be a double-edged sword when it comes to trying out new tactics.\nRead more",

Still, we’re not out of luck yet, nor out of laptops – as you’ll see below, there’s still a variety of deals to choose from, especially in the UK.\nRead more",

That's 6000% over its £43,000 funding goal. You people want this. Are you sure you want this?\nThe board game is a hybrid of competitive deckbuilding and exploration, where 1-4 players travel around an overworld collecting cards to play in separate combat encounters. I do dig deckbuilding, but I suspect this might lack a little magic to anyone who isn't after a nostalgia kick.\nRead more",

For decades, cyberpunks, hackers, and internauts have donned a cool pair of shiny shades to strike a cool pose. But mirrorshades are a serious security hazard in this age of video calls: other people can see your screen and desk reflected in the lenses. If you're mirrored up, people can gain access to private data or see if you are, for example, playing Windows Solitaire instead of paying attention to the meeting. So what's a 21st-century cyberpunk to wear? It's not like you can go without cool glasses (or stop playing Solitaire during meetings). I have ideas.\nRead more",

Whatever you want to call it, though, the main thrust of the game is about finding and taming machine creatures known as Nanos in a techno-apocalypse, mostly so you can battle more Nanos inside a special sealed zone called The Meridian.

I remember it not only because the content is burned into my brain, but because they themed it around getting involved in cosplay, and got a bunch of cosplayers - and no disprespect to them, because they did a great job - to dress as characters from the games. And I kept thinking, like... what? Apart from Ms Drew, what characters are worth cosplaying from a series of licensed Nancy Drew puzzle games?\nAnyway it clearly didn't matter, because I saw the ads so often that I went and bought the most recent one out of curiosity. You win, Her Interactive! Midnight In Salem is a spooky mystery wherein Nancy Drew must solve an arson case (with the Hardy Boys in tow, no less) that has possible occult tie ins. It came out in 2019, and is Nancy Drew #33. 33 Nancy Drew games! Imagine. Also, I cannot download it and I have spent over two weeks trying.\nRead more",

He was one of my favorite characters in Stranger Things, and after seeing him in his new Christmas-y comedy action flick Violent Night this past weekend, he cemented his place as one of my favorite actors working today, period. He can do it all -- drama, comedy, and most importantly, the surrogate father trope that been so hot in games the past console generation. Based on his serious nerd cred alone, I'm surprised Harbour's only games credit will be an upcoming horror game along with Jodie Comer, star of the spy thriller series Killing Eve.\nThere's a chance that all might change, however, because in an interview with Video Games FN, David Harbour shared another game series he dreams of working on: God of War. “I really like what those guys in the God of War universe are doing with my buddy Richard Schiff as Odin,\" he said. \"They sort of mess around with that genre too, and they're always surprising in terms of these gods and they wind up becoming--Thor is a big old jerk and Odin being this kind of older intellectual. I'd be interested in possibly doing some of that.”\n\nWell Mr. Harbour, we would also be interested in you doing some of that. After a series of action-packed roles, he's proved he'd be a perfect fit in both stature and demeanor. Now I'm not advocating for any form on nepotism, but if Richard Schiff is already a friend on the inside, he might be able to get Harbour an audition, at the very least, for any new roles that might arise in the next God of War game.\nSeeing as God of War Ragnarok just came out a few weeks ago, we don't have so much as an announcement that another GoW game is in the works, but I'd bet my money plans have already been lined up for some time now. Now if they can only get David Harbour involved, I might finally be persuaded to give the series a second try...\nThe post Stranger Things’ David Harbour wants a role in the next God of War game appeared first on Destructoid.",

All across my Twitter timeline, I've come across the same old takes, from people lamenting the biggest snubs of the year to people furiously debating the Game of the Year while conveniently ignoring 2/3 of the nominees. At the heart of it all, though, I see the truth: nobody really cares about this stuff.\nThe Game Awards are not prestigious. Nobody actually cares about the winner of any category for more than an hour after the ceremony airs. Even Game of the Year, ostensibly the biggest award in all of video games, as far as I can tell, just doesn't matter all that much. Last year's GotY winner, It Takes Tw…",

          "description": "Father-son picture day kicks off\nGod of War Ragnarok is making it easier to snap those perfect shots today. Photo mode arrives in God of War Ragnarok today, as part of a major update to the title.\nThe v3.00 update adds photo mode, which was confirmed to be a post-launch addition ahead of Ragnarok's release. Today's update adds the option to open photo mode by pressing the Square button while inside the options menu.\nThe Sony Santa Monica team runs down the options in a new PlayStation blog, showing how God of War Ragnarok's photo mode will allow for captures in most places. Whether it's overlooking a beautiful vista or in the middle of absolutely annihilating an ancient creature of myth, there is time to snap some pictures.\nFeatures include expressions for main characters in various different scenes. I won't list them out here in case you're still playing, as some are a bit of a surprise. But you will have some expression control over chunks of God of War Ragnarok's core cast.\nThere are also standard options like hiding characters, adjusting field of view or focal length, shutter controls, and filters with controls for fine adjustments.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1wr0DfV73E\nTake a picture\nPhoto modes have become a prominent feature in games over the last generation or so, as consoles have made saving and uploading in-game screenshots easy. For big Sony games, they've often been pretty solid offerings too.\nGod of War Ragnarok is, from what I've seen, a gorgeous game with a variety of locales to explore. Basically, it seems like good fodder for photo-snapping. And if you've already bought and beat it, now you've got an excuse to trek back over the Nine Realms all over again. The update is live today for all God of War Ragnarok owners.\nThe post God of War Ragnarok gets photo mode in update today appeared first on Destructoid.",

The music was fun, the visuals were beautiful, and it turned out to have some of the best-character focused writing I've seen in games in a long time. We Are OFK turned out to be more of an interactive mini series than a game, but if you're into that sort of thing like I am, it's definitely one to check out.\nNow we just got our first update from the team behind We Are OFK since the game came out back in August, and it's kind of a free DLC, of sorts. The band is releasing a holiday song in collaboration with Sony Music Soundtracks -- their own cover of the seasonal classic \"It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year\" -- which will be accompanied by an interactive music video like the ones from the base game. I love a good holiday single/album from musical artists I love, so it's fun to see OFK getting in on the action. The free update will be available for all players on this Friday, December 9.\nhttps://twitter.com/OFKband/status/1598799498524098561\nThe next tweet in the thread following the announcement also says that OFK \"got offered some special secret collabs.\" I have no idea if this is in regards to their music, games, or both, but it sounds like exciting news based on the emojis in said tweet. Based on the Steam reviews for We Are OFK, it looks like I wasn't the only one who thoroughly enjoyed the game, so I'm looking forward to seeing what the team continues to put out in the future. And of course, I'd love to see other artists and game designers follow suit, because the industry needs more chill interactive narrative experiences.\nThe post We Are OFK is releasing a new holiday-themed song/interactive music video appeared first on Destructoid.",

An early Steam page listing seems to point towards a launch date for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, just ahead of this week's Game Awards.\nUsers spotted earlier today that the Steam store page for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor had been updated with a bunch of information, including a launch date of March 16, 2023. The page was noticed, shared around the internet, and quickly scrubbed, but not before it was read and catalogued by several sites (thanks, Gematsu).\nThe info arrives ahead of The Game Awards 2022, which airs this Thursday, December 8. Respawn and awards showrunner Geoff Keighley have confirmed that Survivor will be showing off its first gameplay at the show.\nhttps://twitter.com/starwars/status/1599813247573655553\nPeering into the future\nWhile Electronic Arts and Respawn haven't confirmed anything yet, it does look like we're getting a look at Survivor either way. The new game is a follow-up to 2019's Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, which followed rogue Jedi Cal Kestis as he fled the Empire and mastered his powers.\nMeanwhile the sequel Jedi: Survivor picks up five years after Fallen Order. It looks like Cal is still dealing with a universe hostile to the Jedi. But we haven't learned too much on what the years mean, or where the conflict has gone, since the conclusion of the first game.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HLDaBGdnLc\nIf the Steam page info pans out to be accurate, it looks like Cal might be picking up a blaster alongside his trusty lightsaber. Obi-Wan might deem that to be a bit uncivilized, but Cal's going through some stuff, so I think we can let it slide.\nWe'll find out more info at The Game Awards 2022 on Thursday, December 8.\nThe post Star Wars Jedi: Survivor leak springs ahead of The Game Awards appeared first on Destructoid.",

Following a presentation that did not, in fact, reveal Tekken 8 at all, the hosts were instructed to basically \"go crazy\" as if they had just seen a major reveal — leaving viewers scratching in their heads as to what was so dang exciting. The situation was cleared up at the Sony State of Play presentation in September, where Bandai Namco officially announced the sequel along with an impressive first trailer.\nhttps://twitter.com/TEKKEN/status/1598739581381349394?s=20&t=arkfL9EHBOU4UWpdS71Y7g\n \nTekken 8, the latest entry in a franchise dating right back to PlayStation's launch days, will utilize the power of Unreal Engine 5, presenting character models and effects unlike those seen in the series to date. Bandai Namco has already noted that the new fighter is being built for PC and current-gen platforms PS5 and Xbox Series X only, suggesting that some pretty hefty hardware will be required for those running local tournaments. Onnly two characters have been officially revealed to date, Kazuya Mishima and Jin Kazama, but we can probably expect more combatants to be revealed this Thursday.\nTekken 8 is in development for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X.

The tag on a new major Xbox game in 2023 will be going from $60 up to $70.\nIGN broke the news that Microsoft's major, built-for-Xbox Series games are seeing a tick up to $69.99 USD. Regional pricing may differ, though specifics have not been outlined yet.\nA spokesperson told IGN that the price reflect \"the content, scale and technical complexity\" of the games. Titles seeing the bump will still be available on launch with Xbox Game Pass.\nThis $70 price point will apply to some of the Xbox heavy-hitters for the new year, including Forza Motorsport, Redfall, and Starfield.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmb2FJGvnAw\nThe price of the game\nXbox head Phil Spencer said in October that he did think the company would, at some point, have to raise prices \"on certain things.\" The price point was going to stick headed into the holidays, but once we're into 2023, that will see the tag finally shift.\nIt's a bump that several other companies have already made, too. PlayStation has hiked its prices up to $70 for its blockbuster first-party games, and publishers like Ubisoft have made similar moves. Others, like Capcom, haven't made the shift.\nThis comes amid a move to hike the price of hardware, too. Sony has also increased the price of the PlayStation 5 in select regions. And on the VR side of things, the Meta Quest 2 saw a price hike earlier this year.\nMicrosoft declined to comment to IGN about any potential console price increases.\nFrequently, the rising cost of development has been cited as a factor in price increases.

          "description": "(Well, a little belatedly, at least)\nYesterday, December 4 might have seemed like any other day, but lo, it was, in fact, Dragon Age Day, and to celebrate the beloved fantasy RPG franchise, Electronic Arts released a new teaser trailer for its long-in-development, long-time-coming sequel Dragon Age: Dreadwolf.\nThe cinematic preview, unfortunately, offers not a dot of gameplay footage, and in fact only runs a scant 60 seconds in length, (truly you are spoiling us). Still, it does give fans something of a re-introduction to the mysterious and wise mage, Solas, also known by his pseudonym of Fen'Harel — The Dreadwolf. Legend tells of a cataclysmic battle that saw Solas seal away both the Creators and The Forgotten Ones, preventing both all-powerful beings from ever again becoming involved in mortal events.\nThis event was known as The Great Betrayal.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z06j2aQSCLM&t\nHaving all but vanished from existence since performing this almighty deed, it seems that Solas has returned, with a plan to break the seals and wreak chaos and destruction among the worlds. According to the dwarf warrior Varric Tethras, who narrates this preview, it will be up to the player's party to stop The Dreadwolf and prevent this frightening act of annihilation from ever coming to pass.\nThe new trailer is probably a little underwhelming to those fans who might have been expecting a little more for this year's DA Day, but it looks like the waiting with have to continue a little longer as developer BioWare continues its work on the epic sequel. Additionally, it is worth remembering that this week sees the arrival of the new animated series Dragon Age: Absolution, which will premiere on Netflix from December 9.\nDragon Age Dreadwolf is currently in development at BioWare.\nThe post Celebrate Dragon Age Day with this new teaser for Dreadwolf appeared first on Destructoid.",

At the end of the last chapter, spectators watched as the game's island was destroyed and then slowly reassembled. For Fortnite Chapter 4, that means getting to know this island from scratch once more. What locations are in? Which ones are out? And most importantly, what do I get if I buy the season pass this time?\nSome of those questions are answered in the launch trailer below. As teased in the cinematic trailer released on Saturday, Geralt of Rivia from The Witcher is in, as is Doom Guy. My Hero Academia is getting some representation too with Izuku Midoriya. Also, dirt bikes. Lots and lots of dirt bikes.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXYxZySYeFU\nThat map looks like it'll be fun to explore though I'd be lying if I said I didn't miss the days when there was a massive cliffside and waterfall right smack in the middle of it.\nAs for that season pass, Doom Guy is available starting on page 5 with the rest of the skins for the season belonging to original characters, including The Ageless. Geralt will get his own set of missions that'll unlock later this season.\nWith the update to Fortnite Chapter 4, current-gen graphics have arrived for the game. Even though I predominantly play on Xbox Series S, I can see some serious changes in how Unreal Engine 5.1 is handling the game. Especially the lighting. The lighting is gorgeous. In fact, I'm tempted to download it to my PS5 to see if there are further improvements my Series S isn't doing.\nThe post Doom Guy, Geralt, and Izuku Midoriya invade Fortnite Chapter 4 appeared first on Destructoid.",

We've been talking about this show for quite some time and now we're just weeks away from its debut. After a couple of short video teases and character posters, the producers of the sure-to-be-viral show finally dropped the debut trailer. And hey, what do you know? It looks like another high-quality production from HBO.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLtkt8BonwM\nMusic choice aside, I think that's a pretty dope trailer and certainly has my hopes up that this will be better than that lousy House of the Dragon show. Of course, with the production team working on The Last of Us, I have some pretty high expectations. Chernobyl is one of the most unsettling shows I've ever seen and considering this IP is Neil Druckmann's baby, I highly doubt he'd want anything reaching the airwaves that doesn't live up to its legacy. Add in a stellar cast and some great visuals, and this show is giving me a reason to restart my HBO Max subscription even if the guy running things over at Warner Bros. Discovery is a real piece of work.\nThe Last of Us will debut on January 15 on HBO and HBO Max.

It may look old, but it's a new game \"harkening back\" to famous franchises from the '80s, according to Koshiro.\nHis team plans to release this game for the Mega Drive (or Genesis in North America). They're considering a few different ideas for launching it, including selling actual physical carts.\nKoshiro posted a series of tweets digging into the design and development of this project. He says the team wants to respect games of the days they love, and will make a game with a \"new system, fascinating graphics, characters, and a soundtrack.\"\nhttps://twitter.com/yuzokoshiro/status/1597788200491442176\nAlongside the soundtrack, Koshiro is also back as a designer. He wants to make the difficulty \"manageable,\" and make it so everyone playing the game can clear all the stages in easy mode.\nAs for the music, Koshiro will be going for some of the classic tools. It's the first time about three decades he's worked on Mega Drive, so that's a pretty exciting prospect.\nA classic throwback\nKoshiro has garnered well-deserved acclaim for his composition and sound work in games, with Streets of Rage being one of the obvious highlights.

          "description": "Harmonix's DJ game is going offline\nThe sun is setting on Harmonix's DJ sim Fuser. The studio is shutting down live services and sales for both Fuser and its DLC on December 19.\nThe news arrives through a statement, confirming that neither Fuser nor its DLC tracks will be up for sale after the 19th. Those who already own Fuser will still be able to play Campaign and Quick Play, using any DLC they have already acquired as well. But online services and other options will be turned off.\n\"Thank you again for your support and for all the amazing mixes over the years,\" reads Harmonix's statement.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lNyZCKe6EM\nHarmonix confirmed earlier this year that while it was ending paid DLC releases for Fuser, the team would keep on supporting the live, in-game features. While some cosmetic content drops had arrived, streams and special sessions were wound down.\nEpic acquired Harmonix in 2021, saying the company would continue rolling out DLC while also working with Epic on Fortnite projects. Specifically, musical journeys and gameplay for the battle royale, which has hosted a number of big concerts throughout its lifespan.\nDance 'til you're dead\nThis is, frankly, a big bummer. Fuser was a genuine surprise for me, as an evolution of the Dropmix format that felt really good to toy around in. It wasn't as loudly groundbreaking as the plastic instrument revolution, but it was an enjoyable experience that led to some fun multiplayer nights with friends, making surprisingly good or beautifully cursed mixes. It wasn't for everyone, but it certainly worked for me.\nAs Harmonix works with Epic on whatever its next projects look like, I'm hopeful that some of the creativity seen in Fuser carries forward. For the DJs of Fuser, though, there are still a few weeks left to join together for sick mixes.\nThe post Fuser is sunsetting live services and sales this month appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It's an aesthetic\nDespite its technical shortcomings, the Famicom (and, by extension, the NES) was a great platform for the vertical shooter sub-genre. It might even be my favorite because, although there was never a port of Raiden for the 8-bit console, developers had to be a bit creative. Famicom shooters are more measured since bullet hell is technically not possible within the strict sprite limitations. Not that I dislike bullet hell, I just prefer a saner approach.\nWhile my personal favorite to point to is Gun*Nac, Konami’s Japan-exclusive Crisis Force is a close second. In fact, Crisis Force even has a few advantages over my beloved Gun*Nac. I don’t think the decision-makers at Konami are even aware that Crisis Force exists, which is criminal.

As one of the only people in my friend group who has a Quest 2, I still get the same exact question every time I bring it up: \"Are there any good games on there?\" The answer, of course, is yes. There are plenty of great games on the Quest 2. However, there are also plenty of bad games on the Quest 2, and separating the wheat from the chaff can be a bit of a challenge.\nVirtual reality is still a bit of a niche market, so it's tough to get a sense of which VR games are actually worth playing.

          "description": "Palworld, AKA “That bizarre Pokémon-ish game with guns”, has a new trailer that puts names to the many cuddly faces that star in this over-the-top adventure.\nMeet the Pal, the monsters that roam Palworld’s colorful yet kind of messed up world. These cuddly though often dangerous critters include the seemingly love-obsessed Lovander, grass panda Mossanda, and Tanzee, which is basically Grookey if it possessed a love for the AK-47. Sure, some of them boldly walk the line of being outright copies of existing Pokémon, but these can carry guns, which we imagine is enough of a separation to repel any lawyers. Check out the latest trailer below. \n\n\nPalworld first gained attention in June 2021. Developer Pocketpair bills the experience as a multiplayer open-world survival game as opposed to a turn-based RPG like Pokémon. As a human character, you can capture, befriend, train, battle, and breed Pal. If you consider yourself a bigger monster than what you're catching, you even sell, eat, and outright exploit Pal for labor. On top of that, you can build houses, battle poachers, and construct factories to put your critters to work. Palworld looks nuts, and we're still not entirely convinced it's a real video game, but we certainly want it to be. \nThankfully, Pocketpair plans to release Palworld in Steam Early Access sometime next year, so we'll hopefully get a chance to try it out sooner than later. The game is currently slated for PC.",

          "description": "Since its reveal in 2016, Lost Soul Aside has been one of the most promising and mysterious projects on the horizon. Today, the upcoming action game made its first peep since its last showing in 2021, showing off its frenetic combat and stylish flair. \nLost Soul Aside began life as a solo project by developer Yang Bing. Its 2016 proof-of-concept trailer impressed many with its triple-A caliber presentation and Devil May Cry-inspired action, including Sony, who scooped up the project as a third-party PS4 exclusive. Bing is now working with a full team, Ultizero Games. Sony announced last year that Lost Soul Aside will come to PS5 as well. The adventure stars protagonist Kazar and his shapeshifting dragon companion, who transforms into various weapons for Kazar to wield. \n\n\nDespite being officially announced for years, today’s video is billed as an “announcement trailer” presumably reintroducing the game to newcomers while reminding everyone else that it still, in fact, exists. The gameplay looks as polished as it ever has, though sadly, we still have no idea when we’ll get to play it. \nLost Soul Aside will be available on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4.

There's a glimpse of this new map at the end of the Chapter 4 \"A New Beginning\" trailer, which you can watch below: \n\n\nHere's another look at the Chapter 4 map: \nElsewhere in the trailer, you can catch a glimpse of new skins that will likely be in the Season 1 battle pass such as Geralt of Rivia from The Witcher series, the Incredible Hulk, the Doom Slayer from Doom, and even YouTuber Mr. Beast. \nBefore all of that, though, players got the chance to experience the Chapter 3 \"Fracture\" finale event today at 4 p.m. ET (if you missed it, unfortunately you cannot go back to play it as of now). In it, we saw the battle island essentially implode with bits and pieces of it scattered across the stars. \nPlayers were tasked with collecting zero point fragments scattered about a small section of this map floating in space. The more players collected, the more pieces were added to the playable area. Players could complete quests such as throwing snowballs at enemies or bouncing players off into space as beach balls. You could also complete races, match island props, and more. Everything you did rewarded you with a zero point fragment. After about 30 to 40 minutes of this, the Chapter 4 trailer began. In it, we saw what appeared to be the creation of the Chapter 4 map, with the zero point dragging in pieces from space to create it. \n\nFortnite Chapter 4 officially begins tomorrow, December 4, but a start time has not yet been revealed. \nDid you participate in the Chapter 3 finale? What did you think of it?

We've seen Pedro Pascal's Joel and Bella Ramsey's Ellie in previous footage, but today's trailer gives us our longest look yet at the duo. Both continue to embody the spirit of Joel and Ellie in the games well and you can watch new footage of their scenes in the newest trailer below: \n\n\nAs you can see, the trailer features a lot more of Joel and Ellie, but it also gives us new looks at clickers, a bloater, and possibly even David (although it could be someone else, like one of David's henchmen). We also see Bill and Frank, and this trailer seems to tease that we'll be getting a lot more of their relationship in the show than we did in the game. In a blink-and-you'll-miss-it couple of moments, we even see Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson, who voiced Joel and Ellie in the games (shout-out to SlashFilm for catching that):\n#TheLastOfUs voice actors Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson appear in the new trailer for the HBO series. pic.twitter.com/z2oY51PFei\nDecember 3, 2022\nThe Last of Us premieres on HBO Max on January 15. \nFor more, check out this teaser trailer from September.\nWhat do you think of today's trailer?

In this case, we’re replaying one of the greatest games of the PS1 era, Silent Hill! Join us live on Twitch each Friday at 2 p.m. Central as we endure two hours of nostalgic, hair-raising scares. If you can’t catch us live, each episode will be available to watch on Saturdays on the Game Informer Shows YouTube channel. \nIn 1999, Konami put the fear of fog in a generation of players with the release of Silent Hill. The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that's (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later.\n\n\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

          "description": "When Sonic Frontiers came out at the start of November, it received one of the better receptions from fans and critics of any 3D Sonic the Hedgehog title. In my review, I praised many elements of Sonic Team's first \"open-zone\" attempt, but my main takeaway was, \"I can’t wait to see how Sonic Team iterates on this formula in future entries.\" While those future entries are likely years away, the developer today gave us a glimpse into how it plans to expand Sonic Frontiers throughout 2023 through a content roadmap.\nThe Sonic Frontiers 2023 content shows off a series of future content updates to the game. The three updates will roll out to players of Sonic Frontiers over the course of 2023 at no additional cost. While no timeline is given, it's probably safe to assume that Update 2 will hit so…",

          "description": "Narrative dinosaur adventure Goodbye Volcano High has awakened from dormancy with a new gameplay trailer and a 2023 release window. The title, unveiled in June 2020 as one of the first PlayStation 5 titles, will now arrive sometime next summer.\nGoodbye Volcano High is a choice-driven teenage coming-of-age story starring Fang, a high school student, aspiring musician, and if you didn’t notice, a pterosaur. Alongside their bandmate Trish and other friends, the dino teens are faced with making the most of their final days together. Developer KO-OP describes the narrative as a tale of “personal growth, acceptance, and the power of community.” A new teaser trailer provides the first look at gameplay, showing off the dialogue interface and rhythm mechanics. \n\n\nKO-OP initially planned to release Goodbye Volcano High in 2021. However, last August, the small team pushed the launch into 2022 due to COVID-related development challenges and the decision to reboot the game’s narrative. The game still didn’t make a peep throughout 2022, and KO-OP says this latest delay stems from continued challenges related to the pandemic and the game’s large scope relative to the team’s size. For example, KO-OP states that over 6,000 voice lines have been recorded on top of completing a significant amount of “bespoke” animations. \nGoodbye Volcano High is slated to launch on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC via Steam.",

It might be a while before we learn more about this remake, too, considering that CDPR told fans to \"please be patient\" because \"it's gonna be a while until we can share more details\" when the company announced this game last month. \nThe Witcher Remake is just one of multiple projects in the works at CDPR. Last month, the company revealed it was developing a brand new Cyberpunk game, multiple new Witcher games (including this remake), and even a new IP under the codename \"Hadar.\" \n[Source: VG247]\nAre you excited that The Witcher Remake will be open-world or do you wish it was more like the original?

Discovery revealed last month that it had hired Peter Safran and Marvel Studios alum and director James Gunn (Guardians of the Galaxy, The Suicide Squad, Peacemaker) to lead as co-CEOs of DC Studios, as reported by Variety. Since then, Gunn has been fielding questions about DC Studios, the DCU's future, and what his plans are as a new lead within DC's entertainment output. \nWhen asked on Twitter yesterday if he and Safran are \"planning to give more DC characters TV shows that'll add to the story for the DCEU,\" Gunn responded, \"Yes, most definitely, the DCU will be connected across film and TV (and animation).\" In a follow-up tweet, another user asked is there are plans to connect games to this larger DCU canon as well, to which Gunn simply responded, \"Yes.\" \nYes.\nNovember 27, 2022\nIt's an interesting response and idea, especially given that it seems clear Warner Bros. Discovery wants its DCU to become something more akin to Marvel Studios' MCU. However, MCU plans don't include video games because Marvel's video game efforts through partners such as Insomniac Games (Marvel's Spider-Man), Crystal Dynamics (Marvel's Avengers), and others do not connect in any way.\nIn fact, Marvel Games vice president and creative director Bill Roseman said back in September that it's important that each studios' Marvel game is not connected to the rest as it allows for narrative freedom said studio might not get otherwise.\nThis is one area DC could differ greatly from Marvel and who knows, perhaps it's the creative edge DC needs to catch up to the MCU. Only time will tell. \nIn the meantime, check out our thoughts on the latest DC game in Game Informer's Gotham Knights review.

According to designer and creative director Ben Esposito, the earliest iteration was in March 2019, more than three years before its release in June 2022. In that time, there were more than 50 different iterations. Sometimes changes were small. Other times they fundamentally altered the level. Every designer who worked on the game has touched Smackdown in some form. Nevertheless, load into it now; chances are all that labor is invisible to you. Before sitting down to write, I beat it in just 11 seconds.\nNeon White is a game built around speedrunning. Levels are short. If you’re playing as intended, you hardly notice your surroundings before moving on. But the only way that works effectively is if levels are meticulously designed to facilitate that movement; they have to be made so that it feels natural for the player to fly through them. Making a level you barely think twice about takes a lot of effort. Read more...",

We asked the people behind the game's success to share how Sonic's second outing became one of Sega's driving forces in its fight against Nintendo.\nComing off of the massive success of the Japan-developed Sonic the Hedgehog, Sega relocated development efforts for the sequel to the newly founded Sega Technical Institute in the U.S. Sega tapped Mark Cerny to lead the STI, who has since gone on to help create other mascots like Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon.

The number, which includes physical and downloadable copies as reported by Nintendo, already places Pokémon Scarlet and Violet in the top 15 best-selling Nintendo Switch titles of all time. In this three-day number, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet have already outpaced lifetime sales of games such as Splatoon 3, Kirby and the Forgotten Land, Nintendo Switch Sports, and Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury.\nThe current overall best-selling Nintendo Switch title is Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, which has sold just over 48 million units as of the end of September. As of this writing, the Pokémon franchise occupies 3 of the top 10 slots of lifetime Nintendo Switch software sales, with Let's Go, Pikachu and Eevee at number 10, Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl at number 8, and Sword and Shield at number 5. Pokémon Scarlet and Violet need to sell just under 5 million more combined copies to crack into the top 10. To date, the Nintendo Switch has sold over 114 million units.\nPokémon Scarlet and Violet represent the first time players are able to explore a fully open-world environment in a mainline Pokémon RPG. While critics praised various aspects of the newest games in the series, the technical performance has been universally panned. However, despite those concerns, Game Freak, The Pokémon Company, and Nintendo clearly have another massive hit on their hands. You can read our full review of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet here.",

Halo, one of the biggest video game franchises ever created, is about an ongoing war with aliens. We enjoy fighting aliens in video games because it’s easy to make creatures from another planet the enemy and they can look like anything.\nThe smaller, more personal alien invasion story, however, is a specific sub-genre of extra-terrestrial narrative we don’t often see in video games.

Units will be able to equip Engage Rings to gain the ability to gain the power of a hero, like Marth or Byleth. When units equip the rings, they become synced with the Emblems, boosting their stats and giving them access to new, Emblem-specific skills. Based on the demonstration in the trailer, this will make a massive difference in a unit’s power level.\n\n\nUnits can also “Engage” with the Emblems, fusing into a new form even more powerful than a synced form. In addition to gaining access to special weapons, the player can use Engage Skills: unique abilities that harken back to the Emblems’ original games. For example, since Byleth was a teacher in Fire Emblem: Three Houses, one of his abilities allows him to teach nearby units, boosting their stats. Meanwhile, Corrin can use an ability called Dragon Vein, which alters the terrain in the same way she was able to in Fire Emblem Fates.\nIn total, the trailer showed off six Emblems: Marth (Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon), Sigurd (Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War), Celica (Fire Emblem Gaiden/Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia), Lyn (Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade), Corrin (Fire Emblem Fates), and Byleth (Fire Emblem: Three Houses). Additionally, a trailer from last week features glimpses of Ike and Lucina, and then mentions 12 rings, implying that Engage will feature more Emblems at launch.\nFire Emblem Engage was announced at a Nintendo Direct back in September. The initial trailer revealed that Alear, the game’s protagonist, is the Divine Dragon, a descendant of a royal family of Dragons that defeated the Fell Dragon many years ago. We’ll know the full story and more when the game launches on January 20, 2023.",
