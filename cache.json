First announced all the way back in 2016, this sci-fi-heavy visual novel was smacked with delay after delay until it finally saw a Japanese-exclusive release on Switch in 2022. Now, Western players have their chance to experience the game, and we’re happy to report that it was (mostly) worth the wait.\nDeveloped by Mages — the company behind popular titles like Steins;Gate and the Famicom Detective Club remakes — Anonymous;Code is the sixth mainline entry in the developer’s loosely connected Science Adventure series. The game brings the action to the far-flung year of 2037, a hyper-futuristic era dominated by augmented reality, world simulators, and AI girlfriends. You are introduced to protagonist Pollon Takaoka, a teenage hacker with a heart of gold and a desire to help those in need.

They go right back to PC games in the early 2000s and continue through to the likes of The ABC Murders, which also made it to Switch back in 2020. Over the years, different developers and publishers have picked up the Christie brand and delivered a range of different experiences. Hercule Poirot: The London Case is the latest, the second effort from developer Blazing Griffin and publisher Microids, following 2021’s Hercule Poirot: The First Cases.\nLike The First Cases before it, The London Case is set before Agatha Christie’s earliest Poirot stories, continuing the chronicle of Hercule’s journey from rising star in the Kingdom of Belgium’s police force, to his fall from grace and stationing as a provincial policeman, to his increasing fame as he unravels one confounding case after another. Although there is some continuity, there is no need to have played the earlier game to follow the story. As the game opens, Poirot is travelling to London to safeguard the transportation of a painting that will be displayed at a museum. We need hardly say that the painting doesn’t stay hanging on the wall for very long, and Poirot finds himself investigating a seemingly impossible vanishing act.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "You may have seen that Alice Bee has started a \"land on every planet\" run of Bethesda's Starfield. By total coincidence - I promise you it's accidental, I was so pleased - I've been working on a \"land on no planets\" run of Starfield. The reasoning for this is as follows: people say that outer space is the worst part of the game, because it's just an irritating interval between the maps where the majority of quests, loot, intrigues, etc are found. It's a fast travel loading screen you can fly about in. But what if you double-down on the space stuff? \r\n\n\r\nWhat if you never descend from orbit, not even to repair, modify or upgrade your ship and offload inventory? What if, rather than buying new ships or building them, you progress exclusively by boarding other captains and making off with ship and cargo? How well does Starfield scrub up as a thoroughbred space sim that leans towards bloodthirsty piracy? Here to answer these questions is Mary Read, my custom character and budding astral freebooter. She's named for her distant descendant, the legendary 18th century English buccaneer Mary Read. She's had a crack at life on shore, setting foot most recently on Earth's Moon, but from this point on, her fate and fortune lies amid the stars. Arrr!\r\n\n \nRead more",

The new title is a sokoban-style puzzle game, which is to say, it's broadly about shoving crates around, but as the name suggests, Void Stranger has bigger ambitions than helping you while away five minutes over lunch. It's a game of faith, amnesia and devilry, which reportedly portions out its secrets across multiple playthroughs. Here's a trailer.\n Read more",

It was actually my favourite act of the whole game - not that I doubt other people saw things going on the wonk a lot, but I did, thankfully, escape more or less unscathed (apart from one instance where, for some reason, Gale the smug sex wizard had a conversation with me, and then immediately repeated the exact same conversation). For me, the final act of BG3 is the act when all my nonsensing in the rest of the game paid off. The part where it turned out it did matter that I spent a painstaking hour separating and killing a bunch of guards in a mine, so I could save the gnomes trapped in a cave-in. It was also where a genie turned me into cheese.\nSpoilers, obvs, if you're that way inclined. \nRead more",

I'm especially grateful when us single player preferers get a knowing nod of acknowledgement in fighting games, too, which are so naturally geared toward pitting your skills against other human beings that anything involving playing against the AI is often either an afterthought or so threadbare that you can't help but feel like you're missing the point. \nBut that's still, for my sins, how I like to consume fighting games when I occasionally play them - which isn't often, I'll admit, for exactly the reasons described above - and so when I sat down for my Mortal Kombat 1 demo session at Gamescom this year, I was pleased to see not just a very slick story mode in attendance, but also a new single player challenge mode called Invasions that publishers Warner Bros described as \"a giant interactive board game\" that \"lent into action RPG\" territory. Its numerous node-based missions looked substantial based on what I played, and the idea of applying a seasonal service model to it, endlessly rotating in new locations and missions every so often - a whole different Invasion, so to speak - is actually something I'd be very much behind. It, that is, I was a) good at Mortal Kombat, and b) the missions I played during my demo weren't quite so… err… boring.\nRead more",

So it is with Starfield, which already has a DLSS mod ready to patch in the class-leading Nvidia upscaler that Bethesda left out in favour of AMD FSR 2.\nIt’s the work of seasoned modder PureDark, previously seen hammering both DLSS and FSR into Skyrim. I’ve tried the Starfield mod and it works rather nicely, granting a visible quality boost on RTX graphics cards while equalling FSR’s ability to smooth out Starfield’s sometimes-tricky performance. Unfortunately (and largely by association), it’s also been dragged into a spot of nasty business, one involving a separate mod for DLSS 3 frame generation and PureDark’s application of DRM.\nRead more",

And, god, I hated it so much.”\nIt’s weird, in fact, that Gaider wound up working on Baldur’s Gate II at all - let alone that he became synonymous with Dragon Age and romanceable companions afterwards. At 27 years old, he ran a hotel in Edmonton, Alberta - the same city where, unbeknownst to him, Bioware was busy making its name. Once it came time to make a sequel to Baldur’s Gate, Bioware cast around for local writers, and a friend recommended Gaider, who had played D&D in the ‘80s before it fell out of fashion.\nRead more",

Well, at the risk of empirically demonstrating that romance is dead, it turns out all that might have been down to a technical problem.

Space sim fanatics were dismayed to learn that you can't actually fly down to the surface of the planets you're orbiting - instead, you hit a button to initiate a loading break and a landing cutscene, which makes outer space feel more like a glorified airlock chamber than, well, outer space. This segmented approach has prompted many unflattering comparisons with No Man's Sky, in which you can manually pilot through the atmosphere. \r\n\n\r\nPlayers and critics were similarly disappointed by the apparent inability to manually fly between planets in different orbits - instead, the game invites you to pick a destination from your star map or while using your spaceship's scanner HUD, with the journey condensed to a cutscene, again. Well, I bring news on this front. You can actually fly \"to\" and perhaps even \"between\" planets in Starfield. But there are some buts. Buts of astronomical dimensions. Onward!\r\n\n \nRead more",

Taken as 'pure' interactive fiction, it'd be shorter and simpler, but might allow its premise, atmosphere, and intriguing world to shine the way they ought to.\r\n\n\r\nThe premise actually takes some explaining. Jules Verne himself takes the place of Aronnax, the protagonist of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Seas, and instead of mere hermitry, his new submarine home/prison is devoted to a guerrilla war against The Nation, a Prussian-ish empire you might be able to stop using a techno-magical gubbins that allows you to edit reality.

          "description": "Earlier this week I attended a hands-off preview for Owlcat's forthcoming CRPG Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader, which is shaping up nicely, inasmuch as there's anything \"nice\" about a Warhammer 40,000 game. Rogue Trader is a party-based affair in which you play a sort of Warhammer East India Company, tasked with flipping outlying worlds to the Imperium. In order to carry out this goal, you're granted a lot more individual license than most human residents of the 40K universe. You can, for instance, recruit ungodly xenos to your grimdark troupe, operate a private armada, and even colonise planets and turn them into your own personal piggybank. Just watch you don't push the whole \"heresy\" thing too far.\r\n\n\r\nI'll have more for you on the subject soonish, but here's an interesting advance snippet from my interview with Owlcat's creative director Alexander Mishulin, in which we discussed what really distinguishes a CRPG from other kinds of role-playing game. According to Mishulin, it's all about designing for choices with consequences that genuinely run the entire length of the game, without (somehow) getting lost in the narrative undergrowth.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's a great little space to discover what will be the next talking points of video games-to-be, and this year's line-up looks to be no exception. Here are all the games you'll be able to play at this year's Leftfield Collection at EGX 2023.   \nRead more",

At the time I thought it was a bit of a duff pretender, honestly.\nBut a good chunk of time with it at this year's Gamescom has swivelled my head back in its direction. Having clacked through some dingy streets, fired blue gloop from my arm, and fought the literal King Of Puppets, I've come to realise it has the potential to be a magnificent Soulslike in its own right.\nRead more",

          "description": "A quick heads-up for those of you hopping aboard the Starfield interstellar express today: there is a non-zero possibility that one of the game's elevators has a shark in it. That's according to Bethesda's head of publishing Pete Hines, who encountered the displaced piscine trouble-maker while playing the game before release. He's \"almost positive\" the shark isn't there any more - and just like that, my understanding of Starfield has been transformed. This isn't a 150 hour RPG treadmill of resource extraction, artefact investigation and base-building, wherein you give spaceship tours and put +5% on your accuracy, or what-have-you. It's an extremely slowburn horror game, with every innocent elevator potentially housing a Great White jumpscare. All of which, Hines feels, is true to how Bethesda \"embraces chaos\" in their games, though he does feel the company's popular association with jank and bugs isn't \"particularly fair\".\nRead more",

It’s a chunky lad compared to its peers, weighing 854g and packing an 8.8in display, but promises a bigger battery and – most interestingly – a pair of Nintendo Switch-style detachable controllers.\r\n\n\r\nThese are partly intended to simply give your wrists a rest, setting the Legion Go down on its (also Switch-esque) integrated kickstand while you play with the loose controllers. The right pad, mind, also includes an optical sensor on the bottom, so you can swish it around a desk like a vertical mouse. Potentially a difference-maker for FPS games? We won’t need to wait long to find out, as the Legion Go is launching on October 31st. It’ll cost a surprisingly un-spooky £699 / $699.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "I don't remember this at the time, but there were complaints about Skyrim's map when it came out, because it was just an extreme zoom out on the world. It wasn't dense with information; the map markers were often kind of an \"it's in this area\" guideline that were even less helpful if what you needed was in a barrow or otherwise underground. Starfield raises the bar by taking the bold step of having a map that is almost not a map.\nI'm referring here to the planet surface map. The starmap is, like a couple of things I've experienced since being hustled through quite an accelerated inciting incident (Starfield's equivalent of Patrick Stewart dying in a sewer after he's charged you with saving the world), reminiscent of Mass Effect. You can select different galaxies, which have one or two solar systems in them, and then can zoom down and select specific planets or moons or whatever to warp to. Once you're wombling about on the surface being a naughty little space captain - or whatever, I don't judge what you're up to - well baby, I hope you like blue voids with a bit of topography.\nRead more",

          "description": "Lord Of The Rings: Return To Moria is a survival game that certainly shares something in common with both Valheim and Deep Rock Galactic: you and a few buds sink pits and set out on expeditions to mine ore, batter monsters, and push further into the darkness. Having watched its game director Jon-Paul Dumont steer me through a 30-minute demo, I’ve come away with the impression it’s far more than just a cheap LOTR pretender. The game strikes me as a real competitor, with well thought out story beats and crafting treats to make Moria’s restoration a hearty adventure… or, if you'd prefer, the equivalent of a Powerwash Simulator.\nRead more",

          "description": "Over the past week, dataminers have been rifling through Baldur's Gate 3's code and have discovered a dragon's hoard of alleged \"cut content\". It's hard to specify what they've unearthed without accidentally sounding the Major Spoilers trumpet and initiating Armageddon, but the supposed buried offerings include additional areas, swathes of dialogue, storylines, cutscenes, characters, romance opportunities and even deities. Given just how much Larian's gargantuan RPG gives you to play with, I am kind of thankful for a generous amount of stuff being \"left out\" - certainly, I don't need any more romanceable NPCs, I'm already fending them off with a broomhandle. But the news has gone down badly with a few players, and especially those who feel the game's overall quality takes a dive in acts 2 and 3.\r\n\n\r\nDevelopers have come to Larian's defence, amongst them David Gaider, former Baldur's Gate 2 and Dragon Age writer, who is nowadays creative director of Summerfall Games, creator of the very earwormy STRAY GODs: The Roleplaying Musical. \"Not surprised to hear of the amount of stuff apparently cut from BG3,\" Gaider wrote on Twix. \"BG2 had a mountain of stuff cut over its development, some early and some even after lots of work had gone into it... almost every game does. Every DA game did. Heck, even Stray Gods had some considerable cuts.\"\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Officially unveiled at this week's Panic Games Showcase, Arco is a triptych of revenge stories set across the deserts, plains and forests of a fantastical, South American-style landscape. It's a part of the world we don't often get to see in games, and its stunning pixel art (and tiny cute little llamas) instantly caught my eye when I got to play an early mission from it at last week's Gamescom. Made by four developers spread across the globe, the official genres listed on its Steam page describe it as a tactical turn-based action adventure RPG where you guide four separate heroes in their fight against the ominous sounding Red Company. But just saying it's turn-based is doing Arco a disservice, I think, as it's also a little bit real-time, a little bit simultaneous turns, and all pretty brilliant, if you ask me. Here are some very early impressions of it.\nRead more",

It just submits reports of bad behaviour, with Activision staff making the final call on enforcement actions, which might involve reviewing recordings to work out the context of an outburst.\nYou can turn off voice chat in Call of Duty to avoid being recorded, but it doesn't look like there's a way to opt out of AI voice moderation in the current/new Call of Duty games at the time of writing.

          "description": "The original Destiny storyline opened following the collapse of a vast Terran civilization at the hands of an invading, amorphous Darkness and its various alien accomplices - an advance stymied only by a benevolent Big Dumb Object known as the Traveller. It cast you as an ancient warrior, resurrected by a flying robot to reclaim humankind's old dominions together with their antique, storied weapons and gear. So much of its appeal for me, back in 2014, was the mystique of that reclamation process, bolstered by alternately zany, obnoxious, fragmentary or intriguing writing that expanded upon the viral mythological element in Halo. \r\n\n\r\nFast-forward nine years, and Destiny 2 has turned the destruction and loss of history wrought by the Darkness into a seasonal - or as it's shortly to become, \"episodic\" - content \"cadence\" (a term that stems from the Latin word for falling) of erosion and restoration, with areas, weapons and quests stripped periodically from the game due to a mixture of technical pressures and commercial priorities. It's sort of become the very thing you're fighting, but where the Darkness aims to engulf and extinguish the Guardians of the Light, Destiny wants to keep you engaged.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Released on Steam this week, The London Case takes young Poirot to, err, London, charged with protecting a famous painting along with a representative of the insurance firm. Naturellement, the painting is stolen from an apparently locked room under everyone's silly noses, and thus begins Poirot and Hastings' first puzzle caper together (for who else is our insurance representative?).\nTechnically, of course, they met in The Mysterious Affair At Styles, when Captain Arthur Hastings was on leave from the front during WW1, but one of the things I like about this series is how it takes what it wants and gently buffs away the rest. If you're going to adapt, then adapt! Like The First Cases, which came out in 2021, the game itself is largely a process of pointing and clicking through crime scenes to find clues, and then joining them in a big mind map akin to what you'd find in a Frogwares Sherlock Holmes game. But having Hastings along does make it a bit more fun, because his role is to be a bit of an idiot.\nRead more",

          "description": "Before Diablo 4 came out, Blizzard had concerns that their latest ARPG would tank the popularity of their most recent entry in the series, Diablo Immortal, Blizzard's franchise general manager Rod Fergusson tells RPS. Immortal, which launched last year as a free-to-play MMO game, left quite a bad taste in our mouths when it launched on PC, especially when it came to the prohibitively high cost of its various microtransactions. Despite this, though, the game's continued to enjoy great success over on mobile, but even Blizzard weren't sure whether its popularity would last once Diablo 4 arrived.\n\"One of the things that we were kind of nervous about initially was that when Diablo 4 landed it would sort of cannibalise Immortal, and that everyone was just going to be, 'Oh we're just playing Immortal until Diablo 4 comes out',\" Fergusson told me at Gamescom. As it turns out, they needn't have been so apprehensive. \"In fact, it was the opposite,\" he says.\nRead more",

I'm wondering if Atari and Graphite Lab's \"creative sequel\" to Pong will face a similar reception. Released in the 70s, the original Pong was videogame tennis. In this reinvention - which, confusingly, is also a sequel to Stuffed Wombat's Qomp, with the Pong branding sort of ladled on top - the homely pixel ball has shattered one player's paddle and escaped into an Axiom Verge-esque labyrinth of spikes, energy beams and floating T-Rex heads. Filing this premise somewhere on the \"what if\" spectrum between the Edge line about talking to the monsters in DOOM and people demanding to land on gas giants in Starfield.

          "description": "You may have noticed a mounting squabble between Starfield fans and detractors concerning the game's planetary maps, triggered by some leaks or fake leaks over the past week. Said skirmish has now escalated to \"-gate\" status, with \"Tilegate\" doing the rounds on forums and even creeping into search results, presumably much to the alarm of innocent, unaligned ceramics company Tilegate Trading Llc in Florida. The nub of the dispute seems to be thus: some people claim the procedurally generated tiles that comprise many Starfield environments actually glue together into complete globes, so that you can see and walk from one to the other and, indeed, all around the equator, while others claim they're discrete maps with invisible walls, similar to those of the astonishing \"dreamable\" space sim Noctis. \r\n\n\r\nWho knows, we might have an under-embargo Starfield review in the works that will lay matters to rest. In the short term, the uncertainty about whether Starfield's planets are actually planets puts me in mind of comparable celestial angst in Bethesda's Elder Scrolls games, where planets are more properly described as planes of existence, conjured by immortal beings, which sort of orbit the mortal world of Tamriel. I've been revisiting how Bethesda's mainstay fantasy games thought about outer space in the run-up to Starfield, and while I'm intrigued by the new game's portrayals of celestial mechanics (latest discovery: the Starfield starmap represents stellar and planetary gravity as dimples on a kind of galactic tarpaulin, as in old Stephen Hawking documentaries), I'll be very surprised if it offers anything quite as wonderfully bizarre.\r\n\n \nRead more",

So, I was rather excited when I had a chance to play it for all of ten minutes in one demo, then around 40 minutes at this year's Gamescom.\nBlazing fast mental arithmetic puts my total time with the game at around 50 minutes... with a catch. The two demos were identical, though, so all of my time was dedicated to smashing the same large skeleton and large rock man. I got to know them and it's battle system intimately, I suppose, so while I can't speak for the quests, but the fights? Gloriously chaotic.\nRead more",

          "description": "Vampires might be the themed threat for Diablo 4's second season, but it was arguably its own player base who drew first blood when season one started at the end of July. As you may have heard by now, Diablo's Season Of The Malignant didn't exactly go down all that well, with much of the hissing and fang-bearing directed toward its nerf-heavy balance patch that arrived a couple of days before the season started in earnest - a series of events that Blizzard's franchise general manager Rod Fergusson describes as \"a perfect storm of a couple of situations\" when I sit down to talk with him at Gamescom. \n\"Season one was exceptional, because we did something we'd never do again,\" says Fergusson. \"As part of listening to players wanting to carry over their renown, we had to put the patch out a couple of days before the season. The intention is that a season and a patch would go [live] the same day, so at the time we make a balance change and you start a level one character, it feels differently to go through the progression with the new balance.\"\nRead more",

I'm struggling to pin it down through the growing white noise of early middle age - as with much else in my life, everything blends into a gritty soup of Metroid and DOOM beyond the turn of the millennium - but I suspect it might have been a level from Rebellion's amazing 1999 Giger 'em up Aliens versus Predator, which I now recall only as screenfuls of fangs illuminated by Smartgun fire. \r\n\n\r\nDoes Sonic 2's Flying Fortress Zone count as abandoned, given that almost every NPC aboard is robotic? Blargh. I'm more confident picking my favourite space derelict, which would include choice excerpts from the debris field of trashed starcraft you traverse in the otherwise-questionable Dead Space 3. I'm hoping for more of that kind of thing in Starfield, in which you'll encounter a wide range of scuttled vessels plus still-crewed, decidedly hostile \"Legendary\" ships that could play a part in the hotly upcoming Bethextravaganza's capacious endgame. There's fresh news on this front from senior level designer Zach Wilson, who has been waxing lyrical online about \"the tragedies and perils of space travel\".\nRead more",

In Tokyo RPG Factory, Square Enix founded a whole studio dedicated to the craft, and more recently Squeenix's \"HD-2D\" style has come to define both their own retro work and that of others. But it's arguably the RPGs from outside Japan that have been doing a better job of propping up the SNES nostalgia tent. Last year's Jack Move and Chained Echoes were both infinitely more refreshing to me than the slightly tired Bravely Default and Octopath Traveler sequels, for example, and now we have The Messenger studio's latest, Sea Of Stars, which is probably one of the few Japanese-inspired RPGs I've played in the last decade that's even come close to bottling the mighty Chrono Trigger and lived to tell the tale. If you're the sort to cry, 'They just don't make 'em like they used to anymore', well, you can dry your tears, because Sea Of Stars is the one that is. \nRead more",

My waking hours are, currently, beset by stress and anxiety from a number of different directions, and I've only had time to play about about an hour of Mediterranea Inferno so far. It's quite a short game, though, and I'm sort of transfixed. It's about three men in their early 20s who, pre-pandemic, were the toast of their party scene in Milan, and after a couple of years apart enforced by a lockdown they're reuniting for a summer mini-break. Having blazed through my early 20s I no longer really remember that unique, potent mix of feeling simultaneously fragile and invincible, but it's captured in this almost occult, yet hyper-real visual novel.\nI may be playing on a Steam Deck on a rainy day, but the bold colour contrasts and the desperate enthusiasm of the dialogue really get over the feeling of a too-hot summer, of trying to force fun and recapture a friendship when you all want different things. The most intense segments of Mediterranea Inferno are the Mirages, visions that merge past and present and metaphor, giving explicit form to each character's wants and anxieties. It's unreal and yet a distillation of reality. It's quite an intense ride so far, but it's a good one.\nRead more",

But it’s a quieter thrill, a stately and absorbing world of hazy forests and sun-pierced catacombs, which calls to mind both Dragon’s Dogma and the overlooked tiny MMO Book of Travels. After catching a hands-off presentation in advance of this year’s Tennocon, I am pretty keen to play.\nRead more",

          "description": "Jubilejní 30. Virtuální Bastlírna přichází ještě před LinuxDays, kde budete moct strahovské bastlíře spatřit naživo. Nepromarněte proto příležitost vysondovat předem kdo na LinuxDays přijede a přijďte na Virtuální Bastlírnu prozradit téma Vašeho příspěvku! Samozřejmě, pokud si chcete nechat svoje téma až na LinuxDays jako překvapení, připravili si strahováci i zásobu novinek a zpráviček, o kterých si lze popovídat. Slyšeli jste třeba už o novém samozhášivém filamentu, MMU3, nové továrně TSMC v Evropě, Chameleonu Ultra, novém foťáku se SPAD senzorem nebo nových levných 12bitových osciloskopech?\r\n\r\nZe světa HW je tady bezdrátové kontaktní pole (ano, nejde o protimluv), nástroj pro montáž zápustných matek do plastu, USB-C tester, nové pokyny pro výrobu ENIG na plošných spojích či ukázka, jak vypadá výrobna flex plošných spojů.\r\n\r\nJako obvykle mají také bastlíři připravena témata nevážná. Vykopnout tuto rubriku lze postupem pro optimalizaci nadzvukového katapultu, ale mají i předražené chytré zámky od Applu, které otevře i batole, úsměvné varování před Flipper Zero (a jak se lidé baví tím, že RFID zařízení se považuje za více nebezpečné než samopal), sebevraždy tiskáren od Bambu Labs nebo Python v Excelu. Jako třešničku strahováci ukáží, jak došlo k \"teroristickému\" útoku na vlaky v Polsku (rychlokurz \"jak nedělat zabezpečovací zařízení\").\r\n\r\nPříští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat ve středu 6. září od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.",

Publisher Selecta Play announced plans to launch the action game on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam. You can see some of its 2D art style in action in the announcement trailer.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1h-w1ImzLk\nBack in the day, it was mostly game advertisements that told players they sucked. In Morkull Ragast's Rage, however, the hero of the story is a villain who is well aware they're in a video game. That means Morkull is also aware of you and the devs that brought him to life. The trailer doesn't show much of the fourth wall destruction that serves as one of the key hooks, but we know the God of Death and Darkness loves quips and pop culture references.\n[caption id=\"attachment_401691\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot via Selecta Play[/caption]\nBad 'tudes \nIt sounds like Morkull's communication with players may go beyond a sprinkling of bad jokes here and there. Selecta Play mentions \"a touch of exploration\" in addition to platforming and action, so maybe he'll keep us all from getting lost along the way. As someone who gets turned around easily in games, I can only dream. \nFrom sketches to inks and animation, the art in Morkull Ragast's Rage is completely hand-drawn, with \"traditional animated films and other two-dimensional video games\" providing the inspiration. It's currently available to wishlist on Steam with more info on the date to be announced later. I'll be bolstering the defenses of my own fourth wall in the meantime.\nThe post Morkull Ragast’s Rage revealed as villainous, fourth wall-breaking platformer appeared first on Destructoid.",

Following its announcement in June 2022, the sequel is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and Steam. The digital launch is still penciled in for sometime in 2024. \nIn addition to the brawling of the first game, Best of Both Worlds is gearing up for a roguelite twist. Complete with light RPG mechanics, this one lets you beat 'em all up on your own or online with up to four players. Developer Hero Concept is aiming for eight playable characters, duking it out against over 40 different enemies. \n[caption id=\"attachment_401682\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot via Hero Concept[/caption]\nTime after time\nFor those of you who come to brawlers for the story, this one is a real time-bender. The dual narratives are set 20 years apart, one following Stronghold agent Stellar and the other following She Wolf. As the parallel worlds unfold, the time-splitting teams will dig into one Mayhem City's darkest secrets. Look, when you call your city \"Mayhem City,\" you should expect a self-fulfilling prophecy or two.\nWith roguelite elements in place, Hero Concept promises new experiences for each playthrough. The devs are also hoping to boost replayability with \"rich endgame content,\" with player choices shaping the outcome. Whatever those choices may be, they'll play out through hand-drawn art and animation with inspiration (and a '90s vibe) from comics.  \nWe can't leap through time like the leads of Mayhem Brawler II: Best of Both Worlds, so we'll have to wait for further details on launch specifics. \nThe post Beat ’em up roguelite hybrid Mayhem Brawler II reveals platforms appeared first on Destructoid.",

Much of this longevity can be attested to the modding community, and there's one that will definitely appeal to you roguelike fans.\nRecently, a trailer for Doom Infinite was uploaded to YouTube. The footage, complete with a metal-ized version of E1M1, shows what you can expect in this mod by difficultoldstuff.\nhttps://youtu.be/kEIDEsTIowA\nFeaturing an \"endless cycle of death and rebirth,\" you're asked with plunging into a \"twisted spiral of never-ending death and bloodlust.\" Not only does it have roguelike elements, it also implements new powerups, weapons mods, and possibly more.\nAs if Doom wasn't fast-paced already\nMore details about Doom Infinite can be found over on ModDB. It's not fully out yet, but you can download the demo/early access version for now. The trailer alone really sells the insane action and violence, and the OG game is already pretty insane and violent. Just a note to say that it's for GZDoom specifically, so you'll need to make sure you have that installed.\nAfter nearly 30 years, it's hard to imagine that Doom is still very much in the gaming limelight. Mods are constantly being made for both the first and second installments of the legendary series.\nBasically, when it comes to Doom Infinite, if you like classic shooters mixed with Binding of Isaac-style roguelike elements, then this one should be right up your alley. And if it's not, well, there's three decades' worth of custom mods to sift through.\nThe post This Doom 2 mod turns the iconic FPS into a high-octane roguelike appeared first on Destructoid.",

But Starfield has recently bucked that trend by helping save someone's life. Reddit user tidyckilla posted an image to the Starfield sub, which shows a nighttime fire in a residential area. The story attached to this photograph credits the Bethesda release with saving them from succumbing to the flames, as they were busy playing the game when they would have otherwise been sleeping soundly.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/168kryk/starfield_saved_me_and_my_familys_life/\nThe post goes on to say that they were up late at night on September 1, having bought the Premium Edition of Starfield. At around 2:26am, they heard an explosion coming from their downstairs neighbor's apartment. Given that the user was up already, they were able to usher their family out of the now-burning building to safety.\nFor all of us who continue to make the most of the night period in order to get some serious gaming in, this vindicates all those years spent ignoring a healthy amount of sleep.\nThe post Starfield proves that staying up all night to play games is a good idea appeared first on Destructoid.",

Bethesda went beyond distant admiration, as Elianora has revealed that they worked as a lighting and clutter artist for Starfield.\nhttps://twitter.com/Elianora/status/1697398867195482500\nAs Elianora explains in her Twitter post, they had only been pretending to not know much about Starfield, and their surprise at the world's detail was feigned, as they had actually helped place a lot of the clutter that you see around Starfield's world.\n[caption id=\"attachment_399834\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot by Destructoid.[/caption]\nElianora's experience with Bethesda's worlds\nElianora's work with Bethesda's games has been extensive. An interview with the studio gives you a window into just how much content they have created for The Elder Scrolls 5 and Fallout 4. Through working with Bethesda's Creation Club, they have also interacted with some of the devs, which Elianora describes as an incredible experience. The creator has also posted an image of a Starfield tattoo they've gotten.\nIt's difficult to overstate just how popular Elianora's mods are in the community. Their Fallout 4 armor compendium has over 3 million downloads, and their Skyrim mods have also been downloaded millions of times.\nThough clutter may seem like a minor factor in a game as large as Starfield, it actually plays a large role crafting the game's atmosphere. Clutter and a feeling of environments being \"lived-in\" is an important aspect of the NASA punk aesthetic developers worked hard to create to ensure the futuristic world still feels relatable.\nThe post Skyrim modder worked as Starfield artist appeared first on Destructoid.",

This little handheld that couldn't served as Sony's last major handheld before the company shifted all its focus onto console games.\nIt's a sad story of a console with unfulfilled potential because I think it's one of the best handhelds ever. It's also one with a creator who had no idea what to do with it.\nWhen the Vita was alive but floundering, Sony had the baffling idea to launch a micro-console using Vita hardware. Mircoconsoles were a phenomenon that only sparked the interest of various companies as the public did not care. While Nvidia's Shield still exists, the Ouya became famous for failing, and Sony's machine was forgotten. Unf…",

          "description": "In a post on Twitter, the official account for Spyro the Dragon announced that Spyro Reignited Trilogy has sold through a whopping 10 million units globally since its launch in 2018. The announcement was made as part of the famed purple dragon’s 25th anniversary celebration, leading up to Spyro Community Day on September 8. \nhttps://twitter.com/SpyroTheDragon/status/1697658224348967118\nAccording to a post on Twitter by user @Canadianguyehh, which was retweeted in solidarity by the Spyro the Dragon account, Spyro Community Day is meant as a celebration of the beloved mascot. Fans are encouraged to “show off some new art, tell your favorite story, Speed run, Livestream the game, cry for a sequel, and everything in-between!”\nIn addition to this significant sales milestone, the team behind the Reignited Trilogy has made the game’s soundtrack available via Spotify. With 45 songs from across the three games, it’s sure to get you in the mood to boot the game up — which you can now do in the Nintendo Switch Blockbuster Sale, where the Reignited Trilogy can be picked up for 60% off its normal price.\nWill there be a new Spyro game?\nIt should be asked if this celebration could result in the announcement of something new for the Spyro series. As of writing, nothing has been confirmed, but if this announcement is any indication, the fans really want another adventure with the wisecracking purple dragon.\nIf anything more is announced—be it a new game, or a remaster of Enter the Dragonfly—in the lead-up to Spyro Community Day, we’ll be certain to update this page accordingly. \nThe post Spyro Reignited Trilogy sells 10 million appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Fans of shooting and floating, take note, because Gunbrella has a launch date. The latest from Doinksoft is set for September 13, 2023 on Nintendo Switch and PC. Described as a \"gritty side-scrolling adventure,\" Gunbrella certainly looks the part in the new release date trailer.\nOkay, it's actually somehow kind of cute, too? Maybe it's the music, or maybe it's the monster that looks like a berserk Tetsuo from the climax of Akira. Whatever horrors your woodsman ends up facing, there's one constant that remains. He'll do so with a gun that is also an umbrella, and that's that. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWWtajLd_0c\nGhouls 'n gangsters\nThe titular firearm isn't just about shooting, gliding, and dashing; it can also be used for close-quarters combat. There aren't many enemies I've seen so far that I'd like to get close to, but I don't think we'll have much of a say in the matter. If you're keen on seeing how this one plays for yourself, a demo is available on both platforms.\nThose who pre-order will get a free copy of 2019's best entry in the cat-in-armored-mech sub-genre, Gato Roboto. The black and white side-scroller is one of those games you can beat in a single sitting if you're up for it, and it's worth playing. It's simple enough, but it looks like Gunbrella is aiming for something on a much larger scale. \nPublisher Devolver Digital is on a roll when it comes to things mixed with guns. The wildly different Wizard with a Gun launches just one month after this one. \nThe post Gunbrella launches on September 13, pre-orders come with free Gato Roboto appeared first on Destructoid.",

Joe: Wrath of Cobra with Q1 2024 release plans on Nintendo Switch, PC, Mac, and Linux via Steam, Epic Games Store, and GOG. \nG.I. Joe: Wrath of Cobra promises both online and couch co-op for up to four players in Story and Arcade Mode. Duke, Scarlett, Snake Eyes, Roadblock, and other classic characters are getting in on it, so you can shelve your figures for a while after launch. A trailer accompanied Maple Powered Games' announcement, providing an idea of how the retro-style brawler looks. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tHrCaYrDd4\nThe forces of nostalgia are firing on all cylinders. There's music from Tee Lopes (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge) with vocals from Crush 40 vocalist Johnny Gioeli. We've also got rough animation that honors the stupendously goofy spirit of the G.I. Joe cartoon. Then it all ends with a quick dash of in-development gameplay footage, which looks like a slightly slower beat 'em up in the vein of The Punisher or Captain America. \n[caption id=\"attachment_401202\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot via Freedom Games[/caption]\nWherever there's trouble\nSome locales planned for Wrath of Cobra include G.I. Joe headquarters, \"The Pit,\" Cobra Island, and Cobra's secret underwater base. You won't get much of a feel for it from the trailer, but apparently Wrath of Cobra sports a parry system. That should come in handy when dealing with enemies like Ninja Vipers, the Crimson Guard, and HISS Tanks. Man, I'd say I miss '80s toys, but you can literally go to Target and pick up exact replicas right now. \nHowever this turns out, at least it's likely to have a killer soundtrack. I don't know that it will reach the heights of the villainous twist theme song from 1987's G.I. Joe: The Movie, but there's plenty of time to dream big.\nThe post Retro GI Joe beat ’em up Wrath of Cobra announced for 2024 appeared first on Destructoid.",

That’s not entirely surprising, as it’s one of the most anticipated releases of the year. It’s always a big event when Bethesda drops a new open-world title, whether it’s Elder Scrolls, Fallout, or a new IP like Starfield.\nHowever, for comparison, right now as I write this, last month’s big game, Baldur’s Gate 3, has over 400,000 concurrent players. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, on the other hand, has 1.2 million people on its servers right now. That’s obscene. Does this mean that Starfield isn’t as nova-hot as many expected? No. Right now, a lot of people are waiting for the Xbox Game Pass version to play or were simply unwilling to pony up for the Premium Edition.\nI sure as heck wasn’t. I’ve not played the game yet, though I hear it’s fantastic. I’m just not that hyped for it. I probably would be over-jazzed if it was Elder Scrolls or Fallout, but those are universes I’m already well-invested in. I’ve played space exploration games before and still do occasionally. I’ve never thought to myself, “this would be better if it was more like Elder Scrolls.” That’s not to say I don’t think Starfield will be good, or that I’m not at all interested in playing it – I’ll definitely be firing it up once it’s on Game Pass.\nWhat I am saying is that I’m more likely to be found playing the games I’ve pulled out of a dumpster than one that clocks over 200K users at once. In other words, I have no taste.\nStarfield will be available for PC and Xbox on September 6, 2023.

Apparently, it comes in three variants with labels for Gridania, Limsa Lominsa, and Ul'dah from Nagahama Distillery.\nHow to get the FFXIV Whiskey\n[caption id=\"attachment_401168\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Square Enix and Nagahama Distillery[/caption]\nThe Amahagan whiskey collection comes from the Japanese department store Isetan and is one of several items available in its anniversary collection, A Decade's Journey. On September 28, both the Shinjuku location and its online store will sell goodies from its FFXIV anniversary event. Bottles cost $60 USD—easily five times the price of my usual wine.\nFor international buyers, you'll have a harder time. Shipping alcohol between borders is a pain, and it looks like Isetan's international shipping vendor doesn't work in this case. However, you may still have better luck once the event begins with other collaboration goodies. I'm kind of eyeing the Warrior of Darkness shirt myself, and don't laugh at my Mother Crystal earrings.\n[caption id=\"attachment_401169\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Square Enix and Isetan[/caption]\nIn 2021, the MMO launched its very own Reaper-themed wine shortly after Endwalker made its debut.

Such was the case with Stardew Valley, and its developer Eric Barone, also known by the pseudonym \"ConcernedApe.\" What’s even more impressive than that, though, is how that experience was converted into a highly coveted board game. While Stardew Valley: The Board Game was available for a limited run, it's coming back very soon.\nhttps://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1696958789717803020\nAccording to a social media post from ConcernedApe themselves, a new printing of Stardew Valley: The Board Game will be available for pre-order on September 5. Units are expected to be shipped in \"October\" of 2023. ConcernedApe clarified in the replies that each copy will set players back $50 USD, but shipping will be free. \nAccording to the game’s official website, they will only be shipped to addresses in the US, but select game stores in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the EU, and the UK may have copies available.\nStardew Valley: The Board Game is a cooperative, multiplayer game where you and a group of farmers will work together to save the titular valley from the evil Joja Corporation. Players can farm, fish, and acquire resources to make protecting the magical Stardew Valley much easier. \nHow long does it take to play Stardew Valley: The Board Game?\nAccording to the game’s official website, it will take approximately 45 minutes per player to play Stardew Valley: The Board Game. The team behind the tabletop edition has emphasized its general challenge level, and “if your game group or family prefers short playtimes (less than 45 minutes) with a small number of rules and components, this game might not be a good fit,” so take from that what you will!\nThe post A new round of Stardew Valley board game pre-orders is coming appeared first on Destructoid.",

That's what Holstin did, both with its general concept and then in-game, as I fled zombies in the demo of this perspective-swapping survival horror.\nHolstin is a survival horror game set in a Polish town in the '90s, overtaken by a mysterious infestation.

Sometimes, new chores mean I’m committing to the same monotonous routine for months, and sometimes that means I’m queuing up for duties long-abandoned, like the MMO’s MOBA-like PvP mode, Rival Wings.\nWhen it comes to achievement hunting, I’m one of those people. Outside of simply playing games I paid for, one of my favorite RPG chores is the thrill of making dinky little to-do lists. I like it when the list gets smaller. I like the satisfying ping with every new accomplishment. I like when Number-Goes-Up.

          "description": "Following a release on PC in February of 2023, Sunsoft has announced that Ikki Unite will launch on Switch in North America in early 2024. Japan will get it slightly earlier in 2023.\nIkki Unite is a bit of a weird one. It is based on a 1985 arcade game that was ported to Famicom in the same year. The Famicom version is considered one of Japan’s “kusoge no densetsu” or “legendary crappy game.” However, rather than try and duplicate the reviled gameplay of the 1985 “classic,” Ikki Unite has a lot more in common with Vampire Survivors. Specifically, it involves hordes of monsters and powering up your auto-firing attacks. The big wrinkle here is that it’s 16-players online.\nI played some of Ikki Unite back when it first released on PC. It was fun, but at the time it was unbalanced and buggy. Sunsoft has patched it a few times since then, and I keep meaning to jump back in to see if they polished out the experience. Its roguelite multi-player gameplay just seemed kind of fascinating to me at the time, but I recall it being a very busy period for me, so I didn’t get a chance to put much time into it.\nWhile details on the Switch release is somewhat sparse, Sunsoft is saying that it will have full crossplay with the current PC version. That’s pretty important. You wouldn’t want to divide the player base of such a niche game.\nIkki Unite is available on PC right now. It will be coming to Switch sometime in early 2024.\nThe post Sunsoft kusoge atonement game Ikki Unite arrives on Switch next year appeared first on Destructoid.",

That damned “onward and upward” that one spews at Mario is locked in a very painful spot in my mind. It’s like having a grain of sand between the folds of brain, slowly aggravating everything around it in small but significant ways.\nThankfully, Nintendo’s own Japanese blog has shared a screenshot that reveals a setting specifically for the “Talking Flower Voice.” While it doesn’t specifically say what settings are available, I’m going to assume that if there is a setting for “voice,” then there is likely one for “no voice.”\nWhat’s funny about Nintendo’s post is that it seems to assume that people are going to want the flowers to talk to incessantly spew their insipid hints in their sharply saccharine voices. They suggest that their voices will make a lively adventure even more lively.\n[caption id=\"attachment_401076\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Nintendo[/caption]\nListen, Nintendo. I don’t know how to describe it, but these talking flowers have very punchable voices. They talk like a dude who is trying to impress a single mother by talking to her child. Their voices drip with cartoonish insincerity that makes me want to ruin their day by telling them the saddest story in my arsenal. If someone stepped out of a cafe and spoke to me in that voice, I would intentionally spill their drink on them, snatch the donut from their hands, and consume it right in front of them.\nSo, thankfully, you can turn it off.\nSuper Mario Bros.

This time, you’ll be tasked with cleaning the grime off of the ‘80s hit movie Back to the Future.\nAfter finally clawing its way out of the muck of Early Access in 2022, PowerWash Simulator has crossed over with a number of properties. This includes games like Tomb Raider and Final Fantasy VII remake and, most recently, Spongebob Squarepants. There’s even a Warhammer 40K crossover lined up.\nReleased in 1985, Back to the Future is one of the most recognizable ‘80s movies. It involves teenager Marty McFly being stranded in the distant past year of 1955. If you want to see anyone over 30 fall to pieces, just remind them that if Back to the Future was made today, Marty would travel back to 1993. Hold on, I… I need to sit down for a second.\nhttps://youtu.be/AWWr1MrrjtA?feature=shared\nThe Back to the Future DLC will include “Doc Brown’s van, the Time Machine, Hill Valley Clocktower, the Holomax Theatre, and Doc’s Time Train. Plus, there are ten new achievements to collect in-game.” Damn, I was kind of hoping to hose off a J.C. Penney sign.\nIn any case, the Back to the Future DLC will arrive for PowerWash Simulator sometime in 2023. The bad news is that it will cost money. Specifically, you’ll need $7.99 USD for the privilege of cleaning off the DeLorean. That’s not something I expected to be writing today.\nThe post PowerWash Simulator is crossing over with Back to the Future appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Not long ago, we spoke about rumors of a new handheld gaming PC from Lenovo that could potentially best Valve's Steam Deck. Well, it turns out the Legion GO is actually happening, and it's coming out at the end of October.\nIn a recent report from GamesRadar+, The upcoming Lenovo machine will be launching this Halloween (literally October 31) and judging from the hardware, it could topple the Steam Deck. However, as always with these more premium gaming devices, there's the price to consider.\nhttps://youtu.be/BLD-dg1C_XU\nAccording to the report, the Legion GO will set you back $799. But hopefully, that extra dosh will be going towards something that can rival the best mobile gaming PCs around.\nWhat's under the hood?\nWhile it will sport 16GB of RAM, similar to the Steam Deck, the overall hardware of the Legion GO looks a little more impressive. For example, the former boasts an AMD RDNA 2 graphics chip, but the latter will utilize the more up-to-date RDNA 3. The GO also comes with 512GB of storage and an SD slot that can hold up to 2TB. Again, similar to the Deck, but that's only if you pay for the more expensive version of Valve's device.\nLenovo's machine will run on Windows 11 as opposed to it being a Linux-based system. It's up to you to decide whether a mobile PC using Windows is a good thing or not, but at least you can be more confident that games will be compatible out of the box.\nCheck out Lenovo's website if you want more information on the Legion GO. Also, check out the above launch trailer, which showcases some of the interesting features it has, including Switch-like controllers, a stronger battery, and AR capabilities.\nThe post Steam Deck alternative Lenovo Legion GO is real, coming October appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "If you thought Diablo 4 would be a nail in the coffin for its mobile-focused counterpart Diablo Immortal, think again. In an interview with RPS, Diablo 4 executive producer Rod Fergusson explains that the popularity of Diablo Immortal has only increased since the release of DIablo 4.\n\"One of the things that we were kind of nervous about initially was that when Diablo 4 landed it would sort of cannibalise Immortal, and that everyone was just going to be, 'Oh we're just playing Immortal until Diablo 4 comes out',\" Fergusson told RPS at Gamescom. \"In fact, it was the opposite. With each beta we did for Diablo 4, the more people started playing Immortal. Then once D4 launched, the same thing. Immortal continues to be successful, so we found that because that idea of playing on my couch in my living room or at my desk vs I'm playing on my phone in the car or while I'm waiting for my coffee or whatever, there was a place for both games to co-exist and they co-exist well.\"\"\n\nThe first part of this isn't much of a surprise. It makes sense that players hyped for D4 would be looking to play a similar title as the release approached. But what is shocking is that even after its launch, the popularity of Immortal has continued to increase.\nAre players happy with Immortal or unhappy with Diablo 4?\nPersonally, Immortal was way too gimmicky and cash-grabby for me. That being said, it's hard to argue that gameplay-wise it felt better than I had expected for a mobile title.\nImmortal also recently released the first new class in the Diablo franchise in over a decade. I have to admit, the class looks fun and unique, so part of the uptick in players for Immortal is people trying the new class.\nIn all fairness though, this may be more attributed to players current unhappiness with the state of Diablo 4. Hopefully, we continue seeing improvements with D4 with Season 2, Season of Blood, which starts on October 17.\nThe post Blizzard says Diablo 4 bolstered Diablo Immortal’s success appeared first on Destructoid.",

It also highlights that parts of the game are playable as an isometric, third-person shooter like last year’s Signalis and as an over-the-shoulder third-person shooter like in Capcom’s recent Resident Evil remakes. \nCheck out the Holstin gameplay reveal trailer for yourself below: \n\n\n“A psychological survival horror game set in an eerie, isolated 90’s Polish town consumed by an ominous presence,” the Holstin Steam page reads. “You’ve come looking for answers, but everyone seems possessed by something foul. Explore the festering town, interrogate locals, and fight ungodly manifestations to get to the truth.” \nThere’s no release date in sight for Holstin, but you can try the game for yourself today through a demo available on Steam right now. \nHolstin is set to release one day on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.\nFor more scary games, read Game Informer’s list of the top 10 horror games to play right now, and then read our list of the top 25 horror games of all time after that.",

I’m roughly 23 hours in, so I still have many galaxies ahead of me, but read Game Informer’s Starfield review for in-depth thoughts on the overall package. With years of build-up and anticipation, I, like many Bethesda Game Studios fans, let my imagination run wild with what this new open world RPG could be. Now that I’ve played a decent chunk of it, it’s quite different from the studios’ Elder Scrolls and Fallout series in some ways. Those two franchises are significantly more open world than Starfield. In fact, Starfield feels more like a great sci-fi theme park with exciting points of interests rather than an open world adventure.

Join us today on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. Central as we take a bloody journey through the game's genre-defining story campaign. Episodes will be uploaded to our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel the following Saturday morning. \nAfter 2006's Mortal Kombat: Armageddon seemingly concluded the franchise's main narrative, 2011's entry picked up the bloody pieces. It moved the saga forward by resetting the timeline, serving as a soft reboot that brought Mortal Kombat back to its 2D fighting roots and ushering in the return of the classic roster. MK 9's cinematic story mode served as an epiphany for the series and fighting games as a whole, establishing the blueprint for narrative fighting campaigns still utilized today. MK9's story also serves as the first chapter of the modern trilogy of games that Mortal Kombat 1 builds upon. For a whole lot more on MK9 and its development, you can read this feature on how the reboot saved the franchise.\nJoin editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they battle their way through MK 9 to see how its reimagined tournament holds up. \nPart 1 - Surpr-iced! \nPart 2 - Bringing The Smoke\nWatch on Twitch!\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

It also revealed that each subscription tier of PlayStation Plus is getting a significant price bump.\nThe PlayStation Blog reveals that September’s free games will be 2022’s Saints Row, Black Desert - Traveler Edition, and Generation Zero. They’ll become available on September 5 and can be downloaded until October 2.\nOn September 6, 12-month subscriptions for PlayStation Plus Essential, Extra, and Premium will be raised to the following prices:\nEssential - $79.99 (from $59.99)\nExtra - $134.99 (from $99.99)\nPremium - $159.99 (from $119.99)\nYou can read this article for a refresher on the benefits of each subscription tier, which will not be changing. Current 12-month subscribers will not see these prices take effect until their next renewal date occurring on or after November 6. Changing your membership (such as buying more time or upgrading/downgrading tiers) on or after September 6 means paying the new prices, though. Sony also states that the new prices remain at a discounted rate compared to the single or three-month options. Sony has not revealed the new monthly/quarterly rates.\nIn the blog post, Sony explains the changes by stating, “This price adjustment will enable us to continue bringing high-quality games and value-added benefits to your PlayStation Plus subscription service.” It’s worth noting that, for now, Sony has not announced any new, additional benefits following the pricing updates.\nThe move comes at a time when several streaming and subscription services have raised their fees, so it’s not entirely surprising. But if you’re looking to sign up for PS Plus or extend/change a subscription, now would be the time in order to save some money.",

While we were at Sega learning about Sonic Superstars, we had the opportunity to sit down with social media manager Katie Chrzanowski to hear the story of how this visual novel murder mystery came to be.\n\n\nFor more Sonic, check out the teaser for Sonic Frontiers' last update, or visit our Sonic Superstars hub below to see all the content from this issue's cover story.",

Bethesda announced the new IP way back in 2018 and after more than five years of waiting, it’s set to launch on Xbox Series X/S and PC next week, on September 6. Based on what Bethesda’s revealed about the sci-fi RPG, it looks set to be the developer Bethesda Game Studios’ biggest game yet. Hitting up its hundreds of planets while fighting space pirates, marines, and more will also require a decent PC build. \n\n\nHere are the PC specifications for Starfield: \nMinimum: \nOS: Windows 10 version 21H1 (10.0.19043)\nProcessor: AMD Ryzen 5 2600X, Intel Core i7-6800K\nMemory: 16 GB RAM\nGraphics: AMD Radeon RX 5700, NVIDIA GeForce 1070 Ti\nDirectX: Version 12\nStorage: 125 GB available space\nAdditional Notes: SSD Required\nRecommended: \nOS: Windows 10/11 with updates\nProcessor: AMD Ryzen 5 3600X, Intel i5-10600K\nMemory: 16 GB RAM\nGraphics: AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080\nDirectX: Version 12\nNetwork: Broadband Internet connection\nStorage: 125 GB available space\nAdditional Notes: SSD Required\nAs you can see, not only is Starfield a large game, needing 125 GB of free space, but it will also require that much space on an SSD. And you’ll want a pretty powerful graphics card and processor to run it at its best, too. \nStarfield hits Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Game Pass on September 6. However, if you preorder the Digital Premium Edition, the Premium Edition Upgrade (which you can purchase if you plan on playing the game through Game Pass), or the Constellation Edition, you can hop into the game up to five days early, starting August 31. \nWhile waiting for the game to launch, check out the Starfield Direct from earlier this summer for more than 40 minutes of footage and check out this special edition Starfield Xbox Series X console wrap afterward. \nAre you picking up Starfield early or jumping in on September 6?

She was 67.\nThe news was announced last night. Sorkin’s credits span numerous sitcoms and other TV series throughout the ‘80s, but her biggest break came in the launch of 1992’s Batman: The Animated Series. Creator Paul Dini wanted to introduce a new character to serve as the Joker’s one-off sidekick. After watching an episode of Days of Our Lives featuring a dream sequence of Sorkin playing a medieval court jester, Dini found his inspiration and contacted Sorkin with the intention of having her play this new villain for a single appearance. Her now-iconic portrayal of Harley Quinn resonated with fans, and she became the breakout character of the show. Harley…",

While movie/comic fans likely know him best from his portrayal of Bobby Drake/Iceman in the X-Men film series, Remedy fans were previously acquainted with Ashmore as protagonist Jack Joyce in 2016's Quantum Break. \nAshmore will play a character named Tim Breaker. Who is Breaker? He’s a sheriff, but that’s all we know for now. However, the fact that he shares a name and occupation with Bright Falls sheriff Sarah Breaker from the first Alan Wake seems more than coincidental. In a video message posted to Twitter by Alan Wake 2 creative director Sam Lake, Ashmore expressed his excitement to work with Remedy again and to play the sequel as an Alan Wake fan himself. \nThe brilliant actor and our good friend, the legendary @ShawnRAshmore plays Tim Breaker in ALAN WAKE 2. We have wanted to work together again ever since Quantum Break. Now it’s happening!! So good to have you in this, Shawn! 🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️🕺🕺🕺 @alanwake @remedygames pic.twitter.com/LQ9lnjA0gx\nAugust 25, 2023\n“I’m very excited to be part of the game with my friends at Remedy Entertainment,\" says Ashmore in the video. \"Our last adventure was Quantum Break, and me personally, I’ve been waiting to play Alan Wake 2 ever since I finished the first game I don’t know how many years ago. I’m sure there’s a lot of people out there that are as excited as I am. So please stay tuned. We’ll release more details about my character, Tim Breaker, and I hope you enjoy playing it. I know I will.\"\nAlan Wake 2 is set to release on October 27, having recently been pushed back from its previous October 17 date. The game stars dual protagonists Alan Wake and FBI agent Saga Anderson, with the former fighting to escape The Dark Place while the latter investigates a murder mystery in the Pacific Northwest.

Check it out below: \n\n\n“Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector will take players to a new location and once again put them in the body of a Sleeper, an escaped corporate-owned android trying to build a new life for themselves,” a press release reads. “This time, however, players will have a ramshackle ship and a crew they’ve recruited, both of which they will need to steer through a system-wide crisis.” \nThis sequel will feature the same dice-based tabletop RPG mechanics of the first Citizen Sleeper, with new systems and mechanics “that will provide more depth, complexity, and challenge.” \n\nIf you want more Citizen Sleeper right now, you can check out the Helion Dispatches, text-based narrative transmissions from the Pilgrim Seed, a refugee ship. These dispatches expand on the series’ lore, set up the narrative of the upcoming sequel, and bridge the gap between the first and second games.

The game mimics realistic climbing and physics, and players control each character's arms to pull themselves up and over ever-changing surfaces and obstacles while thoughtfully using a rope to extend their reach. Along the way, you'll explore the ruins of a lost civilization that once called the mountain its home. What happened to these people? What awaits at the summit for our hero? Jusant invites you to strap on your climbing gear and find out.\nJoin editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they explore a slice of Jusant's early chapters and provide a hands-on impression of this enigmatic adventure.

          "description": "October is already the most stacked month for releases, and Mike Mignola’s Hellboy: Web of Wyrd joins the pack. The upcoming brawler based on the popular comic series kicks off Halloween month with its arrival on October 4.\nThe game was first revealed during last year’s Game Awards and features an original story by Hellboy creator Mike Mignola. The late Lance Reddick voices the titular half-demon. Web of Wyrd evokes its paperback origins with an art direction that faithfully replicates the look of the original comics. Players travel to The Wyrd, a brutal world teeming with supernatural threats, in an investigation to locate a missing member of the B.P.R.D.. The journey takes Hellboy and his allies to the Butterfly House, a location with a mysterious and likely sinister legacy. \nWeb of Wyrd is a pure brawler, with players using Hellboy’s powerful fists to pummel foes while dodging and parrying incoming attacks. His gun, on the other hand, helps keep distant foes at bay. Developer Upstream Arcade also states that the game has roguelike elements. \n\n\nIf that sounds up your alley, you can pick up Hellboy: Web of Wyrd on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.",

First announced in 2021 and based on the original film trilogy, players step into the metallic boots of RoboCop to protect Detroit from its criminal underground. \nActor Peter Weller reprises his role as the titular hero, and a new trailer provides a glimpse into the game’s supporting players. We see Murphy team up with his faithful partner Anne Lewis while being introduced to police psychologist Dr. Olivia Blanche. \n\n\nNaturally, gameplay involves riddling targets with bullets as you march through levels like the walking tank that RoboCop is, but you’ll use investigative features to uncover clues and pinpoint suspects. Rogue City also presents a number of dialogue options to let players decide how to tackle missions. Developer Teyon is behind the project, the team behind Terminator Resistance. \nRoboCop: Rogue City will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",
