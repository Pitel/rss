Confirmed for a western release last year by the publisher, an eShop listing for 30th June 2023 has appeared, suggesting that we won't have to wait too long to get our hands on this classic bundle.\nRayStorm and RayCrisis (also known as RayCrisis: Series Termination) are both related to Taito's 1994 shmup RayForce — RayStorm takes place in an alternate universe, while RayCrisis is a prequel. Rather than their predecessor's pixel art visuals, both games use a 3D polygonal style. And with this HD collection being handled from the talented team at M2, we're sure this is another must-have package for shmup fans on Switch.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

You know, seeing as nobody's played it yet, an' all.\nWe here at Nintendo Life love a good debate, though — our video team just recently ranked every trailer for Tears of the Kingdom, be sure to check out the video and other poll at the bottom of the article — and since Nintendo has now graced us with the third and final trailer for the upcoming sequel, we thought it would be fun to find out whether our lovely community prefers the latest glimpse at Tears of the Kingdom, or its counterpart, the 2017 Nintendo Switch Presentation trailer for Breath of the Wild. The latter is known in some circles as The Best Trailer Ever Made™, but TOTK's final one is a bit tasty, too.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

A new audience can now experience one of PlayStation’s best exclusives, but even better, modders can get their hands on Joel and Ellie’s trek, rejigging a familiar story in new ways. There aren’t too many exciting ones available to download just yet, but one “in-progress” mod reimagines the game in first-person, and it’s stunning.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "When The Witcher Remake devs Fool's Theory and 11 bit studios announced their new RPG The Thaumaturge at the very end of February, I'll admit that the premise didn't immediately grab me. The announcement trailer was little more than an enigmatic pan through the streets of historic Warsaw, and its climactic reveal of a shadowy man performing some Naruto finger magic to conjure a Soulsian monster from the gloom made it seem like yet another supernatural yarn in the vein of Frogwares' The Sinking City and Cyanide's Call Of Cthulhu. The gameplay trailer (embedded below) that followed a few days later revealed a teeny glimmer of what its monster fights actually look like in the flesh, but I still wasn't quite convinced this supernatural tale of demon tamers and interdimensional rifts would end up doing enough to make it stand out. \nBut actually clapping eyes on it in person at GDC? The Thaumaturge had my full attention. Set in Warsaw in 1905 - a period where Poland didn't exist on any real-life map due to it being under occupation by Russia, Germany and Austria at the time - this dark fantasy RPG sees its titular paranormal 'miracle worker' delve deep into the city's political tensions, conducting isometric detective investigations that pull from Fool's Theory's support work on Larian's Divinity: Original Sin games, while also engaging in striking turn-based battles to root out the corruption plaguing its citizens. Plus, with its hard lean into Slavic, rather than Lovecraftian, folklore for its ungodly ghoulies, The Thaumaturge has shot right to the top of my 'keep an eye on this maybe surprise hit' list. \nRead more",

          "description": "Surveying the sprawling piglin outpost before me, a plan forms. With a flourish of button presses from my controller, I spawn a sizeable army of zombies. They'll zomble their way up the main path, and with their high health pools they'll cut into the vast piglin forces and buy me time. With another flourish a contingent of friendly creepers scuttles along behind me. I lead them on a flanking attack around the outpost, targeting their spawners while the main piglin army is occupied with my frontal assault. A masterpiece of tactical engineering!\nOr it would have been, if my minions weren't so bloody stupid. Half my zombies fell off the staircase they were climbing due to their terrible pathfinding, and burned up in the lava moat below. Meanwhile, I sent my creepers off to explode against the first spawner I found. Only one of them got there; the others relentlessly humped a wall they could easily have climbed, until Piglins surrounded and slaughtered them. I returned to my starting point with what remained of my army, a fair bit poorer in resources, and a great deal poorer in patience.\nWelcome to Minecraft Legends, a strange mixture of real-time strategy and open-world adventure which frustrates and impresses in equal measure. There's half a great game lurking here, but it's marred by inadequacies that have nibbled away at me like piglins at my walls. This game could have been so much more.\nRead more",

I chatted to John Patrick Lowrie (The Sniper), Gary Schwartz (The Heavy, The Demoman), Robin Atkin Downes (The Medic) and Ellen McLain (The Administrator) about the game's fifteen year long legacy, the process of finding their character's voices as well as their favourite quotes. It was a riot of an interview and, to be honest, a bit of a career highlight. It also did really well on TikTok, which I have mixed feelings about.\r\n\nFifteen minutes after the gang left the grimy conference room in which the interview took place (I had immediately crawled onto the floor in an attempt to ease the anxiety from having conducted said interview), I got a Twitter notification. Robin had posted a video. Following our chat, the group had attempted to order a sandwich from a cafe in-character, leaving the staff completely bemused as a result. Understandably the video did numbers, and over the last six months, the gang have been releasing new episodes in what is now known as \"The Sandvich Saga\" on a regular basis.\nRead more",

Which is to remake the old Lovecraft-themed Sherlock Holmes game, but with new assets.\nIt's also got new puzzles and areas, and a slightly rewritten story to account for this being a sequel to Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One. It's a smaller, less ambitious game than Chapter One with some jank knocking around, and I wouldn't recommend it if you're not a fan of the series, but you know what? I think there's a glimmer of greatness in the very fact of its constraints.\nRead more",

So, The Tank he lived, and also died. Questing endlessly in this grimy medieval world won’t cut it. You’ll also need to keep your troupe paid and fed, so when evening fell to find nought but a handful of foraged mushrooms and a single mouldy apple I’d pried from the fingertips of a disemboweled bandit, it was time to get creative.\n“Waste not, want not”, said the Earl of Human Sandwich, the inventor of cannibalism (I’m told). With this in mind, I’d invested one of my early ‘Knowledge Points’ into a tech that let me repurpose my dearly departed as delicious drumsticks. Slain friendlies don’t disappear after battle. Instead, you’ll find their tastefully dressed corpses in the loot menu afterwards. Ghoulishly, the ‘loot all’ option doesn’t add their cadavers to your inventory with the rest. You’ll have to manually drag them over, giving you just enough time to consciously make the decision to either bury or eat them. I did not bury him.\nRead more",

What begins as a light-hearted slice-of-life high school romantic comedy eventually pulls the rug out from under the player, and transforms into a war epic featuring mechs and aliens with a much darker tone. In Muv-Luv’s original Japanese release, this twist was hidden and only briefly hinted at in the marketing.\nToday both Muv-Luv games are easily available on Steam, marketed specifically with this twist, and where they sit fully-translated and with Overwhelmingly Positive reviews. iOS and Android ports are apparently in development, and other Muv-Luv spin-offs continue to get translated. But the first time anyone experienced a complete English language version of Muv-Luv was in July 2010, when a fan translation group called Amaterasu released a patch localising the first game.\nRead more",

          "description": "There are so many ways to cut this cake. I could call it a weird game, and bang on about those for a bit. I could call it a 2D beat 'em up with your classic heavy/light attacks (actually punch/kick, but whatever), which is important to mention. It's also tempting to namedrop the things it reminded me of, like Hotline Miami, Beraltors, and a tiny hint of The Cat Lady, but that could get you picturing just about anything, and is unfairly reductive to a game that has the right to stand on its own.\nPill Baby is, obviously, all those things.

          "description": "Look, I’m not saying Far Cry 3 is responsible for *gestures vaguely towards modern AAA games* but it’s definitely a prime suspect. If I was trying to connect a piece of red string from the middle of my evidence board (which would probably be a picture of the map screen from Assassin’s Creed Valhalla), I’m not sure I’d push a pin directly into Jason Brody’s face, but I’d definitely circle it in black Sharpie a few times. Basically, in the eleven years since its release, I’ve grown a bit suspicious of Far Cry 3’s lasting legacy. \r\n\n\r\nAnd yet, in those halcyon days of 2012, we named it our game of the year. Although it’d be easy to simply say that decision was made a bit before my time here, I should probably admit that when reviewing the game for the blog I used to run when I was at university, I awarded it an equally prestigious (stop laughing at the back) 10/10. That almost seems ludicrous, doesn’t it? Far Cry 3? Game of the year? Surely not.\r\n\n\r\nAfter spending a few hours revisiting the sunny shores of Rook Island, I was shocked to discover a game that feels surprisingly pure. Mechanically, I hasten to add. The actual act of playing Far Cry 3 in 2023 is still good fun, it’s the bits around it that are a bit ropey.\r\n \nRead more",

It's had, and continues to have, a few problems with its PC launch last week, so we discuss that, we talk about the TV show, and we talk about some of the impact the game has had in general. Nate tells us all about Ceramus the Brick Knight, James polls us on Steam Deck alternatives coming out of the woodwork, and there are a lot of cowboy metaphors. Plus: what we've been playing this week, and our recommendations! It's a rootin', tootin' good time alright!

As a fun homage, you can find the PICO-8 version inside Celeste proper. And now, as an even funner homage, you can play it on the Playdate. A loveable game on a loveable handheld.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "There's a moment in BioShock Infinite's opening act that's always stuck with me. As you emerge onto the floating city of Columbia, the game takes you on a guided tour of the sights and sounds of this airbone civilization. As you saunter through the streets, you learn about its citizens and its creator, just sort of taking it all in. The sun is shining. You're surrounded by smiles. Before you know it, an airship rises above the clouds and perches next to a hugging couple, gently swaying in the summer breeze. Aboard the ship is a barbershop quartet, cheerfully harmonising the iconic Beach Boys tune God Only Knows. It's a memorable scene, and has become an integral part of the game's lasting iconography. \r\n\n\r\nBut for Tyler, Nick, Derek and Greg, this section was more than just a fun tease for the secret behind Columbia's unusual success. Self-confessed music school kids, the quartet inspired them to create their own musical group styled after Infinite's singing hairdressers. In 2023, BioShop Infinite celebrated their ninth year at PAX East, where they performed a wonderful collection of harmonised tunes to an absolutely packed community room - and we were there to film it.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "AMD si oproti Intelu připisuje jedno další sympatické vedení. Pro oba výrobce x86 CPU dosud platilo, že Linux považuje nahrávání mikrokódu CPU za špinavou praktiku, která může kernel rozhodit a učinit nedůvěryhodným. Jediná přípustná praktika byla, že se mikrokód CPU nahraje standardně ještě před startem operačního systému, jak se sluší a patří. Nyní AMD ale hlásí, že práce jsou hotovy a na současných procesorech AMD lze považovat pozdní nahrávání mikrokódu CPU u již běžících linuxových systémů za důvěryhodné a bezpečné. Vše doprovází příslušný patch.",

This would suggest that once players have had their fill of single-player content, then they can delete that part of the game to conserve space, while still retaining all of the online modes.\nIf so, then this represents just one more way that Capcom is attempting to redefine the Street Fighter experience with the highly anticipated sequel. SF6 already boasts myriad control methods, as well as exciting new modes, a fully overhauled single-player experience, and all manner of small tweaks to elements such as ranking, matchmaking, online connectivity, mini-games and side activities, and other content to ensure that the new title will deliver one of the most fully-featured SF experiences ever.\nStreet Fighter 6 launches June 2 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms. Capcom will be holding a dedicated Street Fighter Showcase live stream this Thursday, promising more news and announcements. In the meantime, be sure to check out our previous reports on the 50 things I loved in the beta, my impressions on the sequel so far, as well as suggestions on the 10 World Warriors who would fit right into the new title as post-launch DLC.\nThe post Street Fighter 6 may support partitioned downloads for various modes appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The mystery Pokemon is related to Terapagos\nEarlier this year, we learned that Pokemon Scarlet & Violet would be getting two DLC drops spread across 2023, similar to the last generation. \"The Teal Mask\" arrives in the fall and \"The Indigo Disk\" is coming in the winter; since their initial reveal, we haven't learned much info about the DLC: until recently.\nThe new generation of the anime (sans Ash) teased another upcoming Pokemon, and it looked to be directly related to (or perhaps an early/chibi form of) Terapagos. Well, the Pokemon Company straight-up confirmed it in a tweet today.\nHere's a quick recap of all the info we have so far:\n\"A newly discovered Pokemon appears in The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero for Pokemon Scarlet or Pokemon Violet! Its splendid aura is reminiscent of the Legendary Pokemon Terapagos, but this Pokemon’s name and true nature are shrouded in mystery. This Pokemon is small in stature and not particularly strong, but when push comes to shove, it can crystallize the energy in its body to form a protective shield. Apparently, it can also assume a dormant state when it feels that its life is in danger by pulling its head, limbs, and tail into its shell and making itself look like a jewel.\"\n\nSo we got a full official image of the Pokemon beyond the anime, and we know it's related to Terapagos (one of the new DLC 'mons). It's something! It could be the Mew to the Terapagos' Mewtwo, or it could be unrelated and simply \"reminiscent\" of the DLC turtle (or something else entirely, as Pokemon has myriad ways to create new 'Dex entries or accommodate for forms). Either way, it's nice to see another 'mon confirmed that'll eventually be added to the 'Dex far ahead of the fall.\nhttps://twitter.com/Pokemon/status/1647948029805182976\nThe post It’s time for another Pokémon Scarlet & Violet DLC tease appeared first on Destructoid.",

It feels like such a big part of the overall gaming landscape and the successful indie narrative; and I still play it yearly with a fairly sizable group of people. And it's still going, too! Stardew boss Eric \"ConcernedApe\" Barone tweeted out an update on Stardew Valley version 1.6, and it's still going ahead as planned (albeit with their next project on pause for a bit).\nHere's the full update from ConcernedApe themselves (as a reminder, Haunted Chocolatier is the next game from ConcernedApe, and has been teased periodically since late 2021):\n\"There is going to be a Stardew 1.6 update. It's mostly changes for modders (which will make it easier & more powerful to mod). But there is also new game content, albeit much less than 1.5. I'm taking a break from Haunted Chocolatier to work on this at the moment. Then back to HC.\"\n\nResponding to a fan, we got one more tidbit about what 1.6 will entail:\n\"...The new update will have some more dialogues. [W]orking on it as we speak!\"\n\nThey also doled out a bit more info on Haunted Chocolatier:\n\"The town is on the water and there are docks.\"\n\nIt really showcases just how big the fanbase is for ConcernedApe when that simple statement causes a speculative feeding frenzy. I mean, even if it just has a small amount of gameplay content, I'll be fully replaying it!\nMy guess is that ConcernedApe will never truly shake the siren's song of Stardew: and will do small updates here and there indefinitely.

And given that we are a mere two weeks into Mario & Co.'s box office busting, the number-crunchers are eagerly anticipating the possibility that the film may eventually hit the platinum prestige of a one billion dollar box office.\nAs I've noted before, the Hollywood bigwigs own the most easily turned of heads, and it would not be a surprise to see an absolute plethora of video game adaptations greenlit in the coming 10 years, to what, I'm sure, will be varying reward.\nThe Super Mario Bros.

          "description": "Pump up the Jam\nThis week's trip back to the golden age of gaming, guided by the retro-lovers over at Hamster Corporation, sees us take a look at the much lesser-known sequel to one of the most beloved coin-op classics of all time — Now available on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, its Namco's Dig Dug II!\nReleased to the arcade market in 1985, before later being ported to the Famicom platform, Dig Dug II features all of the sounds and visuals of the seminal 1982 original, but chooses to set the action on the surface, forgoing the mine-based gameplay of the original and somewhat removing both the \"Dig\" and the \"Dug\". Hero Taizo returns, once again armed with his trusty harpoon pump with which he must fend off iconic enemies including Pookas, and Fygars.\nIn addition, Taizo is now equipped with a jackhammer, and is able to partition areas of each stage to sink into the ocean, destroying all nearby enemies, and perhaps Taizo himself if the player is careless with their jackhammering activities. You can check out the cutesy action for yourself in the gameplay video below, courtesy of YouTuber Replay Burners.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvPB1HOVXrA&ab_channel=ReplayBurners\nWhile Namco should be congratulated for at least trying something a little different, Dig Dug II just doesn't have quite the same compelling nature of the original, with the top-down maze style a poor replacement for the original game's strategic tunneling system. The sequel would not receive an official home release outside of its native Japan, only appearing in the form of latter-day Namco compilations and retro re-releases. It's perfectly fine, of course, as is the case for almost all Namco classics, but simply cannot hold water when compared to its exceptionally well-designed forerunner.\nDig Dug II is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.\nThe post It’s Pooka Time: Namco’s Dig Dug II joins the Arcade Archives appeared first on Destructoid.",

Once you've purchased the console itself, there are additional Joy-Con controllers, the Nintendo Switch Online membership, and, of course, first-party titles like Super Mario Odyssey that almost never seem to go on sale, even years after their release.\nThankfully, there are some awesome games on this system that cost absolutely nothing to play and are most certainly worth your time and attention.

But seeing a certain Pokemon wreak havoc again in the fight's emerging meta triggers my déjà vu. Of course, I’m getting a little ahead of myself.\nFor those just tuning in to what has become a biweekly feature, let’s give the usual rundown.

Originally on Famicom in 1984, it was still stuck in the arcade mindset. It was very strictly round-based, there was no real progression, and the best you could do was compete for best time, which wasn’t actually recorded on the game itself.\nThe most console-specific feature that it had was a track builder, which was definitely cool. However, on NES, you couldn’t actually save your track, which was far less cool. If you were on Famicom, you could actually save tracks using the Famicom Data Recorder, which would save your data to a cassette tape. That’s extremely cool to a retro geek like me.

          "description": "A new look for an evolving studio\nRemedy Entertainment is updating its look. After over 20 years of sticking to the same logo, Remedy unveiled its new logo today.\nThe old Remedy logo, with a bullet in the letter R, was representative of the era of Max Payne, and a different kind of Remedy. But, as communications director Thomas Puha writes in the announcement, Remedy is evolving. And so its logo is evolving, too, to better reflect today's Remedy.\n\"The Remedy logo means a lot to us, but we know it also means a lot to you,\" Puha said. \"Like the games we create at Remedy, we approached this process with great care, consideration and a lot of passion! We want to create memorable worlds, stories, and characters for you to experience through our games. We wanted our new logo to reflect how we constantly evolve and continue creating exciting games with the very best people. However, it’s all still one Remedy where courageous creativity thrives. We hope you like the new look.\"\nThe new logo, seen above, is an R with a bit of a mirrored, staggered look. It does remind me a bit of some of the visual effects from Control, which suits Remedy's lean into sci-fi storytelling over the years.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyJvCq4HvQ4\nA question of identity\nIt might seem like a little shift, but reading about this today did make me reflect on how Remedy has shifted over the years. The studio started out in 1995, with an eye-shaped logo that infamously prompted a standoff with LucasArts and led to the logo that stuck for two decades.\nIn the time since, Remedy went from May Payne to Alan Wake, then on to Quantum Break. And now, with the success of 2019's Control, the studio is planning several spin-offs, as well as a Max Payne remake compilation. There's even Alan Wake 2 due out this year, a launch target that Remedy reaffirms in today's news. The studio's certainly grown a lot, and now it's got a new look to go with it.\nThe post Remedy has a new company logo, for first time in over 20 years appeared first on Destructoid.",

Company of Heroes 3 will feature a fully overhauled U.I. and control system designed especially for the console platforms, with in-game features such as Full Tactical Pause allowing players to masterfully control their troops in the thick of the action, unperturbed by the lack of mouse & keyboard control systems.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDfn-TFydEY&ab_channel=SEGA\nSet against the backdrop of the North African campaign of World War II, Company of Heroes 3 offers up new solo and multiplayer game modes, as well as the new, sandbox-style, Italian campaign. Unfortunately, reviews were incredibly divisive for the ambitious new release, and while many praised the sequel's new control features and highly impressive destruction physics, some critics complained that the title didn't do enough to recreate the intensity of battle, with weak A.I. opposition and a casual approach to moment-to-moment warfare.\nFortunately, the community has been utilizing the feedback forum to discuss the title's issues with developers. So, hopefully, there will be time and opportunity to polish the game's rougher edges.\nCompany of Heroes 3 launches on PS5 and Xbox Series X May 30.

The campaign runs until May 3, 2023 and is seeking €8,500.\nThis is kind of hilarious. The Murder Hotel is a murder mystery, but rather than figure out the murderer, I guess you already know: It’s some scissor-wielding demon. The demon won’t let you leave unless you pin their murders on the various guests. Like, they didn’t actually do it, but you have to come up with a super-plausible theory that “proves” that they did. So, you’re just deliberately accusing innocent people.\n[caption id=\"attachment_373827\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Wegenbartho-Games[/caption]\nYou need to convince a demon council, so maybe there won’t be any real repercussions for these people you accuse. I choose to believe they’re just going to be sucked down into Hell. I’m feeling really malicious, so I want to just creatively screw some digital people over.\nBeyond the concept being delectable, the campaign is pretty informative on where the project is and what planning has been done. It’s enough information to build confidence and outline all the plans.\nThe downside is that the plan is for The Murder Hotel to launch in December 2024. That’s a reasonable development period, but I want it now. There are stretch goals for more languages and another to have actual voice-over. I hate when people talk to me, so that’s not a must-have feature for me.\nThe Murder Hotel is slated for release on Switch and PC.

Pick your favorite aspect of the Triforce, or maybe just your favorite holder to back, and join in the inky battles.\nThe Splatfest will also host fights on a special version of Scorch Gorge, with a Triforce-style layout. This map seems pretty well-suited to Tricolor Turf Wars in particular, which seems like it could make that mode fairly appealing for the weekend.\nhttps://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1646876839527485440\nGet your Splatoon x Zelda virtual look too\nIt's not just about the battles, though. As any Splatoon player will tell you, it's as much about the fashion. And this special three-way Splatfest will also have residents of the Splatlands dressing up in themed shirts for the showdown, too.\nThemed shirts are also hitting the Nintendo store, for real-life wear. So if you're a fan of both Splatoon and Zelda, and wanted to express that in everyday life, you've got an easy medium for it now. There's also a sale available for a bundle with Splatoon 3 and a three-month Nintendo Switch membership, running from April 17 through May 7.\nNintendo hosted a launch-window Splatfest for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet as well, and it's nice to see them keeping the trend up. It's a fun way to celebrate a new game launch, and all the added theming and cosmetics are a neat touch. So yes, I think I'll be booting Splatoon back up for a few matches, just to lock in my Power vote and shirt.\nThe post Splatoon 3 is hosting a Legend of Zelda-themed Splatfest next month appeared first on Destructoid.",

That means the game is essentially complete and is ready to be pressed to discs.\nThe game is set to arrive on PlayStation and Xbox consoles plus PC, and while it's good to go for launch, Blizzard plans to continually update the always-online game with various content updates over the next several years. Fans recently got to explore the game's revamped take on Sanctuary for themselves in two back-to-back weekend open betas in March, letting them taste a big slice of the now-finished pie.\n“Going gold is a landmark milestone for the incredible Diablo IV team, who have all worked so hard crafting the next-generation installment of this iconic franchise. This is a concrete, meaningful step toward our June 6 launch,” said Rod Fergusson, general manager of Diablo. “Whether players are veterans of the franchise or jumping in for the first time, we can’t wait for everyone to experience the full game: taking part in the incredible storytelling, experimenting with character classes and builds, and exploring what the endgame and the dark world of Sanctuary has to offer.”\nDiablo IV is Game Informer’s cover story this month, and you can subscribe to the digital issue to read it right now. The print edition will start hitting subscribers’ mailboxes within the month.",

In his announcement tweet, Staten confirms that the game is a brand-new IP and referred to the project as a \"AAA multiplatform\" experience. You can read the full tweets below.\nSo today, I'm thrilled to announce that I've joined @Netflix Games as Creative Director for a brand-new AAA multiplatform game and original IP. Let's go! 2/2\nApril 17, 2023\nStaten is best known for his work as a writer and cinematic director at Bungie and Microsoft, mainly working on the Halo series. While he spent a few years working at the publishing side of Microsoft, in 2020, he returned to the Halo series to work on Halo Infinite, where he worked as the game's creative director. This continued until earlier this year when he returned to the publishing side of the company amidst widespread layoffs. Now, he's left the company entirely to work on this new project with Netflix.\nThis is only the latest news in Netflix's spree of expansion into the gaming industry. It recently released a sequel to Valiant Hearts as part of a collaboration with Ubisoft. Last year, it acquired the developers behind Cozy Grove, bringing its total number of internal development teams to five if you include the in-house studio that Staten just joined. On top of that, the film and tv side of Netflix has been working on loads of game adaptations, including Gears of War, Pokémon Concierge, and a new patch of episodes of Sonic Prime.\nDo you play games through your Netflix subscription?

The cast also includes Edi Patterson (The Righteous Gemstones), Julian Barratt (Mindhorn), Scott Mescudi (AKA Kid Cudi), Ellie Taylor (Ted Lasso), and Rory McCann (Game of Thrones).\nPlot details remain scant, but Knuckles is set after the events of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and before the upcoming third film, set to hit theaters on December 20, 2024.

This acquisition will begin next month and is expected to conclude in the second quarter of the 2024 fiscal year once it's completed the necessary antitrust reviews. \n“Among the rapidly growing global gaming market, the mobile gaming market has especially high potential, and it has been Sega’s long-term goal to accelerate its expansion in this field,” says Haruki Satomi, president and group CEO of Sega Sammy Holdings. “I feel blessed to be able to announce such a transaction with Rovio, a company that owns 'Angry Birds', which is loved across the world, and home to many skilled employees that support the company’s industry leading mobile game development and operating capabilities. Historically, as represented by the ‘Sonic the Hedgehog' series, Sega has released countless video game titles to various gaming platforms. I am confident that, through combination of both companies’ brands, characters, fanbase, as well as corporate culture and functionality, there will be significant synergies created going forward.”\n“Red and Sonic the Hedgehog: two globally recognized and iconic characters made by two remarkably complementary companies, with a worldwide reach that spans mobile, PC/console, and beyond,” says Rovio CEO Alexandre Pelletier-Normand in a statement. “Combining the strengths of Rovio and Sega presents an incredibly exciting future.”\nRovio is best known as the creator of Angry Birds, a massively successful series of mobile games that have since turned into a global media brand. In addition to a multitude of games, the series has spawned two animated films and several TV and web series.",

The previous logo was pretty much just the letter R too, but this one has a different font and kind of hurts our eyes looking at it. \nIn a blog post, Remedy gives its simple rationale for the update: \n“The bullet in the letter R in the old logo represented the era of Max Payne, but the Remedy of now is much bigger than a single game; we have a whole portfolio of games, new and old.  \nIt was time to update and redefine our visual identity to bring more consistency, showcase our evolution over the years, and better express our vision of today’s Remedy.”\nSo there you have it.

Players will need to have completed the entirety of the main campaign to start the expansion. Once they have, Aloy will receive a call on her Focus which will kick off the DLC. \nHorizon Forbidden West: Burning Shores launches on April 19.

Though the story begins by following protagonist Clive in his 20s, the plot will also explore periods of his teen years and 30s. We got a look at the world map, various accessibility rings, and the combat prowess of Clive’s faithful wolf companion, Torgal. \nWe also looked at Cid’s hideaway, a large headquarters that opens up later in the game where you can craft gear, buy items at a store, check quests, interact with allies, and practice abilities in a special training room. Despite showing off so much, teases that Square Enix still has plenty to share in the future regarding story quests, side quests, and endgame content. \nFinal Fantasy XVI launches on June 22 for PlayStation 5. You can learn more about the game by reading our recent features breaking down the game's Eikon combat, Arcade Mode, and interviews with the developers who discuss the game's balance of multiple gameplay styles, its return to high-fantasy, and the series' abandonment of turn-based action.",

Developer Rocksteady posted a short message on Twitter stating it wants to “take the time needed” to ensure the best possible experience. Check it out below.\nSuicide Squad: Kill the Justice League puts players in the shoes of Harley Quinn, Captain Boomerang, Deadshot, and King Shark as they fight to rescue Metropolis from an invasion by Brainiac. The villain has hijacked the minds of the Justice League, meaning the Squad has to take down Earth's greatest protectors to save the day. The game has received a hefty dose of fan vitriol since its last gameplay demonstration in February confirmed an always-online requirement as well as live service elements, such as a cosmetics-only battle pass. Other fans have found its cooperative loot-based shooting to be an uninspired fit for the property.\nAlthough we don't know the specifics behind the delay, sources told Bloomberg in its original report last month that Rocksteady was only pushing the game to add polish and did not plan to overhaul the game’s existing framework. Even though a nearly-year-long delay is a lot of time, it's still very unlikely that it's enough for the team to make the sort of dramatic changes some fans are hoping for. We'll have to wait and see how Rocksteady spruces up the Suicide Squad and hope it results in a quality experience when the dust finally settles. \nWhat do you think of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League's delay?

That big honor goes to the classic Super Mario Bros. theme.\nOfficially titled “Ground Theme,” it was composed by Nintendo’s Koji Kondo and first appeared in 1985’s Super Mario Bros in World 1-1. The song has since become the most well-known melody of the Mario franchise, not to mention one of the most recognizable music tracks in video games. Now, it will be forever preserved alongside some of pop culture's most famous and influential songs. \n“Having this music preserved alongside so many other classic songs is such a great honor,” said Kondo in a statement. “It's actually a little bit difficult to believe.”\nMario’s classic tune will be inducted alongside heavy hitters such as Madonna’s “Like a Virgin,” Jimmy Buffet’s “Margaritaville,” Queen Latifah’s “All Hail the Queen,” and Mariah Carey’s “All I Want for Christmas is You.” You can read the full list of inductees at the Libary of Congress’ website. \nThis is quite an achievement for Nintendo and especially Kondo, who has lent his talents to numerous other Nintendo soundtracks and also had a hand in composing the music for the very successful The Super Mario Bros. Movie. You can read our recent interview with Kondo and Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto about the making of the film here.",

That includes a $206 million domestic haul, $146 million of which was earned over the weekend (remember the film premiered on a Wednesday). Overseas, the movie has earned over $173 million.\nAdditionally, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is now the top opening film of 2023 (beating Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania), has become Illumination’s most successful opening, and has the best opening of any video game film adaptation (surpassing Sonic the Hedgehog 2's debut). The film also has the biggest five-day premiere ever, a record previously held by Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. If all of that wasn’t enough, the film also has the biggest IMAX opening weekend of all time at $21.6 million globally.\nNeedless to say, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is exceeding expectations, and it’ll be interesting to see if it can maintain such a strong start. To get an idea of how it fares, you can read our review of the film here.

          "description": "For April's issue of Game Informer magazine, we took a look behind the scenes at Hyper Light Breaker, the latest game from developer Heart Machine. In addition to an interview with Creative Director Alx Preston, we were able to view exclusive footage of one of the game's mini-bosses, The Last Master. Check out the reveal below.\n\n\nThe Last Master is a deadly opponent that spawns randomly when players (known in this world as Breakers) activate beacons, objects that allow them to access the main boss gate. If you think she looks similar to the player characters, you've got the right idea; in the video, Preston says \"She ended up here in this land as a Breaker and succumbed to the dangers of the Overgrowth.\" As a result, The Last Master's arsenal mirrors yours, wielding a sword, a spear, and an automatic pistol. Her behavior mirrors the Breakers' as well, and she can dash, jump, and climb after anyone that attempts to escape.\nWhile the first game in the Hyper Light franchise was a 2D single-player experience, this new title is a 3-player co-op rogue-lite, with a new procedurally generated open world on every run. Players will create a Breaker, explore a cursed land called the Overgrowth, and attempt to the bosses plaguing this realm known as Crowns.\n\nFor more of the game, check out our feature in the latest issue of Game Informer. You also can see the initial reveal trailer here and the IGN's gameplay reveal right here. Hyper Light Breaker enters early access this fall.",

We spoke with several of the game’s principal designers at Blizzard to learn more about the game’s endgame content, such as Helltides and Nightmare Dungeons, and provide a final overview of everything the game has to offer before it launches on June 6.\nSetting the table for Diablo IV’s dark tone are two haunting pieces of cover art designed by the famed artist Brom. Our standard cover showcases the heavenly might of the rogue angel Inarius while the Game Informer Gold cover features Lilith, Diablo IV’s main antagonist, in all her demonic glory.\nIssue 355 also includes a conversation about life and death with former Tango Gameworks artist and director Ikumi Nakamura in the abandoned streets of late-night Tokyo (which you can read online). You’ll also find an entertaining personal story about using VR as a carnival scam, a feature detailing Devil May Cry 5’s influence on Final Fantasy XVI’s combat, and an emotional piece discussing how a grieving father found solace in the Shenmue series’ depiction of loss. You'll also be treated to previews for upcoming titles, including Redfall, Exoprimal, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. \nYou can also try to nab a Game Informer Gold version of the issue. Limited to a numbered print run per issue, this premium version of Game Informer isn't available for sale. To learn about places where you might be able to get a copy, check out our official Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, and stay tuned for more details in the coming weeks.

There are no cars, people, or sounds to distract me. I can’t avoid what I’m seeing: a host of creatures about to be murdered.\nWe’re standing at a slaughterhouse. But it’s a slaughterhouse in a deeply strange location, or, as Nakamura calls it, “Silicon Valley,” the technology district of Shinagawa in Tokyo, Japan. As I look at trucks packed full of cows at – whether they know it or not – the end of their lives, immense skyscrapers surround us, housing tech goliaths. Sony, Canon, and Microsoft all have offices here.

However, as Double Fine founder Tim Schafer, who made his name working on point-and-click adventure games for LucasArts, seemed to think, there was still a sizable enough audience out there that someone should make a new one. Why not Double Fine? And why not go directly to the source – the fans – for the game's funding?\nIn Double Fine's pitch, it theorized the then-unnamed project as a smaller game. The company asked for $400,000 from fans – specifically $300,000 to make the game and $100,000 to allow documentary crew 2 Player Productions to film the development.

The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog is a real visual novel in which you investigate the death of Sega's beloved mascot, currently free on Steam. Here's the game's description via the publisher: \nIt's Amy Rose's birthday, and she's hosting a murder mystery party on the Mirage Express! When Sonic the Hedgehog becomes the game's victim, everyone is off to get to the bottom of things. However, something feels a bit off - is this really an innocent game or is something more sinister afoot?\nSurprisingly, the free game has proved very popular. As told by Sonic social media manager Katie Chrzanowski (via GameSpot), more one million people have played the game. Going a step further, it's apparently the 61st highest-reviewed game on Steam right now, and as GameSpot points out, the best-rated Sonic game on Steam (though that's not the highest margin to clear, all things considered). As of this writing, The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog has over 11,000 user reviews on Steam, netting it an \"Overwhelmingly Positive\" ranking. You can check the game out for yourself right here. \nOver 1,000,000 of you have grabbed The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog and it's currently the #61 highest rated game on Steam of ALL TIME.\npic.twitter.com/Cy2cIo2AHl\nApril 5, 2023\nThis all just goes to show – the world wants Sonic dead.",

Seeing the game in action answered a number of questions and presented a handful of intriguing new ones. For one, the game can be played alone, and though their animations differ, Mickey, Minnie, Donald, and Goofy all play the same. It's not a Super Mario Bros. 2 situation where they all run at different speeds and jump different heights. No matter who your favorite character is (Donald being an early cont…",

Even just looking at screenshots of the game recalls the best of the era, and that’s not an accident. Developer Sabotage Studio’s CEO and Sea of Stars’ creative director, Thierry Boulanger, is a huge fan of the genre and has been building towards making a game like this since he started building the fantasy world Sea of Stars and The Messenger takes place in during Elementary school.\nDozens of classic RPGs inspired Sea of Stars’ development, including Chrono Trigger and Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars, but we asked Boulanger to pick the most significant ones in the video below. \n\n\nIf you enjoy this video, please subscribe to the Game Informer YouTube channel. This video feature is part of our indie-focused magazine issue, which Sea of Stars headlines. Visit our online cover story hub to learn how Chrono Trigger composer Yasunori Mitsuda came to work on Sea of Stars or watch our latest documentary in which we explore caves with the creator of Spelunky. \nDon't let my byline fool you – Game Informer staffers Kyle Hilliard and Charles Harte worked hard to produce this video feature.

Season 4, which starts next week, brings players the next post-launch hero in the form of Lifeweaver, a unique support character. In preparation for Lifeweaver's impending release, Blizzard released a ton of new details surrounding the nature-loving character.\nLifeweaver comes to the Overwatch team from Thailand and uses advanced biolight technology, which plays a major role in his abilities. As a result, his kit introduces some new mechanics. First up, his first primary ability, Healing Blossom, charges a luminescent flower, which he sends off to teammates.

          "description": "Looking for an excuse to break out that Leviathan Axe for another adventure? As of today, there's a new update for God of War Ragnarök featuring a load of new content, all built around a robust New Game Plus mode.\nNew Game Plus opens up for anyone who has beaten the game, and all of your equipment and skills will come along for the ride. You also have access to all weapons, including the Draupnir Spear. However, it should be noted that areas requiring that spear to access will still remain closed until you reach the appropriate point in the story. For similar reasons, you also won’t start your new playthrough with Sonic or Hex arrows.\nSeveral new armors show up. The most interesting is the Spartan Armor, which recalls Kratos’ look from the old days in the Greek Pantheon. While wearing it, you get no perk, no stats, and it’s locked at Power Level 1 – expect a challenge.\nNew Game Plus also features a new level cap, enchantments, and progression paths to improve your capabilities. Players can also tackle an expanded version of the Niflheim Arena, where you play as either Kratos or Atreus and bring along a variety of companions to help out.\nAmong several other additions and improvements, players can also take on a Black and White Render mode for a more cinematic playthrough.\nIt’s a notably large blast of new content that ensures that dedicated fans should have good reason to jump back in if they desire.\nGod of War Ragnarök released last November for PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4.\nYou can read the full details on the newly arriving content over at the PlayStation Blog.",

While the game's imminent arrival to the online service was announced at a Nintendo Direct in September 2022, today is the day we finally know when we can play it. Pokémon Stadium comes to Nintendo Switch Online Wednesday, April 12. As is the case with all N64 games, you'll need the expansion pack in order to play it. Check out the full trailer below.\n\n\nWhile some fans may have hoped this port would include trading with Pokémon Home, they're unfortunately out of luck. The fine print in the trailer specifies that \"Pokémon cannot be transferred to this game.\" That said, there is also a notable improvement: four-player online multiplayer will be available, so you can play Clefairy Says or Sushi-Go-Round with friends all over.\nNintendo Switch Online's expansion pack had a slow start, but its library has gradually snowballed into a much more significant package. In February, the service added a Game Boy Advance library, which included fan favorites like The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap and Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga. A month later, Metroid Fusion joined the lineup. Meanwhile, the base tier of NSO got an update last month that added another small handful of titles. To see all the retro games currently available on the service, check out our complete list.\nWhat's your favorite minigame in Pokémon Stadium? Let us know in the comments!",
