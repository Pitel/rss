The game uses the initial shadowy version of the protagonist to introduce the unique combat mechanics that you’ll need to get a handle on if you’re going to survive in this strange alien world.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

As it stands though, its generally high quality and interesting systems just haven't captured my imagination.\nIt is not unimaginative, though. Some of its playable races are the usual elves and goblins, but most have a twist, like the cannibalistic dwarves, gold-obsessed necromancers, or the \"cursed toadlings\" I picked almost reflexively: a people transformed along with their warrior Queen Charming.

          "description": "When I meet Jake Solomon at GDC, it's his third day of unemployment. The XCOM and Marvel's Midnight Suns director and designer announced he was leaving Firaxis back in February, but his final day at the studio where he made his name and worked for more than twenty years was still very fresh in his memory. \"It's surreal,\" he says. \"For probably the next ten years, I'll refer to it as 'we' when we talk about Firaxis, and it's sad to think it's not the right pronoun anymore. It's exciting, but a little terrifying.\"\nOn the face of it, that panic might seem unfounded. Over the last decade, Solomon has become one of the most revered names in turn-based strategy games. Having cut his teeth on many of Sid Meier's Civilization games in his early years at Firaxis, he went on to become the designer who spearheaded the revival of XCOM with Enemy Unknown in 2012, before going on to direct its even more beloved sequel XCOM 2 and its War Of The Chosen expansion a few years later. Most recently, he was creative director on Marvel's Midnight Suns, which allowed him to marry his life-long love of Marvel comic books with the thrilling tactical combat he's so well known for. \nSolomon's next adventure, though, won't have the certainty of Midnight Suns' supercharged attack cards, or even the tease of an XCOM hit percentage backing him up. For not only is it Solomon's third day of unemployment when we speak; it's also the day after he revealed his plans to leave turn-based tactics games behind altogether. Instead, his sights are now set on the life simulation genre, a move that, at first glance, seems at odds with his career as a strategy designer. But over the course of our hour-long chat, it becomes increasingly clear that life sims have been a life-long obsession for Solomon, and he might have even made one by now had the development of XCOM 2 gone a little differently. \nRead more",

Anyway, it's proven to be an excellent way to rinse Vampire Survivors, a game I wouldn't - I have nothing against those who do -  play upright on a monitor. Survival is best served on the couch, curled up like a shrimp with the blood draining from my arms as I hold the TV slab at some atrocious angle.\nAnyway, I've come to realise that Vampire Survivors might be a game about running away, but actually peaks when you come to a standstill. There's a special kind of joy to be had when you're able to stop and idle.\nRead more",

Somehow, despite being primed by the excellent time I had with its demo five years ago, I just bounced off this one. I very quickly got stuck in a frustrating loop of fatally ballsing up no matter what I did - presumably I badly biffed my stats right out the gate to get soft-locked in the first area - and despite deciding I'd restart in a day or two, several years later my play-time hasn't extended past that first session. Sad times all round, I'm sure you'll agree, but what's it got to do with Betrayal At Club Low?\nWell, when I picked up Betrayal At Club Low for the RPS Game Club this month, I was transported back to my abortive run at Disco Elysium. It's not that I've never played a stat-check-heavy RPG before. Far from it. But somehow, each game's presentation resonated together in my weird brain mush. It must have been something to do with the combination of a surreal, seedy, not-quite-our-world-but-still-very-recognisable setting, and the constant presence of numbers reminding me of my character's strengths stacked up against their many, many weaknesses.\nRead more",

Larger space regimes require more work, so this expansion is for fans of big government, focusing on Stellaris' collection of leaders, expanding the council system, and introducing deeper character progression. It’s also adding a new Origin delving into the leader who founded your galactic empire, which you can see teased in the very short, very non-descript trailer below. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "For all its flamingo thigh stews, misshapen clothes model characters and pizza-themed DJ-ing, Betrayal At Club Low is an old-school, dice-throwing RPG through and through. Every interaction you have at Club Low is determined by the rolling of dice, whether it's simply attempting to spark a conversation with a hard-of-hearing bartender, or bluffing your way into VIP backrooms where your blown fellow agent Gemini Jay is currently being grilled by the intimidating Big Mo. \nWhether you're successful in your endeavours depends on whether you can roll higher or equal to whatever value is thrown by your opponent, with each face corresponding to a particular Skill Dice you're trying to deploy to win that scenario. A lot of the time, your skill numbers aren't nearly good enough to beat your fellow clubber outright, but for me, the thrill of Club Low comes from clinching a very plain, and highly unremarkable draw, earning you the accolade of 'Success. Barely' in the ensuing results breakdown. It may not sound very sexy, but in a world where the odds are fully stacked against you, barely succeeding will do me just fine here, thanks.\nRead more",

Every month*, I'm going to be spending some time highlighting a cool indie game that deserves your attention. Think of this series as a supplement to Sin's Scout Report or our Indiescovery podcast. A brand new method for delivering piping hot recs from my desktop to yours.\nMy aim is to use this series as a springboard to dive deep into specific elements of a game I find particularly fascinating, sharing my discoveries with you lot behind the paywall first (and don't worry, regular readers, I'll also be making each of these videos public for all to see after a month, which should roughly coincide with the the next one going live for supporters). In it, I'll be discussing some common themes between multiple games, digging into underappreciated gems from years gone by... The remit is broad and nebulous, to the point where it's clearly obvious why I haven't been able to come up with a name for it yet.\r\n\n(If you end up thinking of something, please do let me know in the comments. More than anything it'll stop me messaging Katharine a list of awful possibilites every other week, which I can only imagine is negatively effecting her feelings about me, the site and the endeavour of games journalism in general.

Last year’s Stray meowed its way into every cat lover’s heart, Little Kitty, Big City is taking things a chaotic step further later this year, and A Space For The Unbound had an abundance of cats just lying about. Just last night, we received a release date for Mineko’s Night Market, a slice-of-life adventure that’s set on a Japanese island bursting with kittens, cats, cat gods, and other furry feline variations.\r\n\n\r\nAlice0 first wrote about Mineko’s Night Market six years ago, and it’ll finally open its doors on September 26th.

I wanted to see how well that smoothness and stability would carry over to the Steam Deck, and although the long-delayed zombie mulcher needs some cuts to quality settings, finding the right balance will have Dead Island 2 running almost as comfortably as the very best Steam Deck games.\nAlas, it’s still not the ideal handheld game, thanks both to the odd crash (lowering settings helps with this) and the fact that it needs some tinkering with the Epic Games Launcher to get it playable in the first place. Still, playable it very much is.\nLet’s start by addressing Dead Island 2’s lack of a Steam version; it launches on February 21st as an Epic Games exclusive, and since DI2 isn’t even listed on Steam right now, that’s unlikely to change any time soon. Luckily, there are workarounds: you can either install the Heroic Launcher, or follow our handy guide on how to install the Epic Games Launcher on the Steam Deck. Both of these should allow you to get Dead Island 2 downloaded onto the handheld, still using your regular Epic account.\n Read more",

It's about a small, cosy café where customers can travel back in time by sitting in a very particular chair, for the length of time it takes for a cup of coffee to go cold. It's not long by any means, but it affords its cast of regulars the chance to get some closure on an issue that's often been plaguing them throughout their lives. It's heart-warming, soppy stuff, but very feel-good. That January was also about the same time I slurped up every last episode of Midnight Diner on Netflix, where a chill Japanese man known only as The Master serves up delicious looking dishes in a tiny, 10-person izakaya from midnight onwards. Put these two things together, and it's probably no surprise that I liked the original Coffee Talk more than most.\nCoffee Talk Episode 2: Hibiscus & Butterfly is a continuation of that story, set three years later in the same, alternate version of Seattle where elves, werewolves, orcs, mermaids and other fantastical creatures all rub shoulders as city-dwelling citizens in need of a good cuppa. Once again, you play as the owner of the titular late-night coffee shop, brewing up a multitude of exotic hot drinks that you'll need to match to each customer's request that night as they tell you their woes. \nRead more",

Katharine got to see three of those characters in action during her preview - where she walked away very excited about the game’s emergent chaos - and now developer Harebrained Schemes have revealed all ten playable agents. Oh boy, do they look stylish.\r\n\n \nRead more",

My only job is to cut out the big \"ums\" from the audio mix, not writing words about the things we did a chat about! Thankfully this week Indiescovery is all about change, as we're experimenting with a brand new format. A group review! We've all been playing Dredge, the eldritch fishing adventure by Black Salt Games, and hoo boy do we have some thoughts about it. Spoilers: much like Katharine, we all think it's really really good.\r\n\n\r\nElsewhere, the review bonanza continues. Rachel's been rewriting fiction in Storyteller, I've been reclaiming the wasteland in Terra Nil and Rebecca has been dating hot monsters in Romancelvania. We also chat about burgers, olives and our current hyperfixations because hey, this is an episode of Indiescovery after all.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "author": "Katharine Castle",
          "description": "In the world of turn-based strategy games, it's probably fair to say that we've been waiting a heck of a long time for Jagged Alliance to make its next move. Almost a quarter of a century has passed since the last numbered entry in the series, and the many attempts that have been made to recapture its tactical, mercenary magic since then have been mixed at best, and reviled at worst. Haemimont Games, the devs behind Tropico and current custodians of the upcoming Jagged Alliance 3, know this, and their publisher THQ Nordic said as much back in September 2021 when it was first revealed, assuring players they were going to create a game that \"really does justice to the Jagged Alliance legacy\".  \nBut in an era where turn-based tactics games are now increasingly defined by genre titans such as XCOM and Into The Breach, I'm not sure that legacy means all that much anymore. I've been playing a substantial early chunk of Jagged Alliance 3 over the last week or so, and its decision to pare back crucial information such as chance-to-hit and other modern conveniences has mostly left me feeling frustrated and annoyed rather than daring and excited. The writing also made me cringe so hard at times I think even the neighbours heard my groans of despair. It certainly looks the part of a modern strategy game, its detailed African landscape, top down perspective and interactive objects calling to mind Mimimi's excellent Desperados 3 and Shadow Tactics games, but the rest feels like it's been lifted straight out of the late 90s where we last left Jagged Alliance 2 - and not necessarily to its benefit.\nRead more",

Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time.

          "description": "A World Worth Saving\nAt the end of Horizon Forbidden West, Aloy encounters a dilemma. She can either follow Tilda van der Meer the Far Zenith and escape from a planet that is facing near-certain doom from Nemesis the misanthropic AI. Alternatively, she can remain on Earth and attempt to put up a fight. It should come as a spoiler to nobody that Aloy doesn’t for a second think of abandoning her home planet and all its inhabitants.\nDespite Aloy’s commitment to her planet, her time on it has been anything but utopian. She has watched loved ones like Varl and Rost perish, discovered the fatal selfishness of the Old Ones, and at times it seems impossible that the quarreling between tribes will ever cease. Naturally, this leaves one wondering whether Earth and its inhabitants deserve to be saved…",

          "description": "And it's all documented\nThe \"oops all Malenia\" mod in Elden Ring has been popular for a while now, as an offshoot of the \"Elden Ring Item and Enemy Randomizer.\" Yeah, you heard me correctly! To be clear, this particular challenge run involves swapping every enemy into Malenia: one of the toughest bosses in the game. Hilariously, the mod even titles bosses appropriately, like \"Malenia, the First Elden Lord\" or \"Eden Malenia\" for the final encounter. Who else to better handle this bizarre task than Let Me Solo Her: the legendary hero of the community that was even recognized by the developers.\nLet Me Solo Her has been documenting their journey through an all Malenia run for about a month, and just finished this week. They even went in with self-imposed parameters:\nDon't level vigor (the stat that grants players HP)\nGet the Jar Helm (and wear no other armor)\nBeat the game\nIt sounds \"simple,\" right? Well, it took them roughly 10 hours! While they were a bit hard on themselves with recounting their clear time, I'm sure a lot of folks spent 10 hours in a single area, so they probably shouldn't sweat it too much. I mean, the lack of HP and defensive gear essentially amounts to a \"no hit\" run with an infamous boss subbed in for hundreds of potential enemies. Fair trade!\nWhere to watch Let Me Solo Her run through Elden Ring with the Malendia mod\nYou can check out their journey on their official YouTube channel, and the finale is embedded below\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-OORwgQXjs\nThe post Elden Ring superstar Let Me Solo Her beats mod where every enemy is Malenia appeared first on Destructoid.",

Will Arnett will provide the voice of Sweet Tooth, while the notorious murderer's physical presence will be that of legendary pro-wrestling star Samoa Joe. Cobra Kai's Michael Jonathan Smith served as writer and showrunner for the series, which wrapped filming last summer and is now in post-production.\nTwisted Metal is one of a number of PlayStation film and TV adaptations currently in development.

          "description": "Most successful Q1 in hardware history\nSony has released its financial results for the latest fiscal quarter, revealing that princely PlayStation 5 (PS5) hardware has surpassed 38 million sales since its launch back in the fall of 2020.\nThe first quarter of 2023 has been especially impressive for the PS5 platform, and has seen a total of around 6.3 million consoles shipped since the start of the year. This represents the most successful Q1 shipping totals for any console in gaming history, and is up a mammoth four million units over the same period in 2022. When compared to its predecessor, PS4, PlayStation 5 is tracking just behind that platform's sales to the same point, suggesting that the coming years will see PS5 meet — and likely surpass — PS4's total sales.\nSony also revealed that it currently counts 47.4 million PlayStation Plus subscribers, which is equal to the amount of subscribers counted for the same period in 2022. This sees the PlayStation brand recover from the dip it suffered over the course of 2022's latter half. Game sales, however, continue to slide, as PS4 and PS5 software sales sold 68 million units in the first quarter of 2023, which is down 2.5 million from the 70.5 million titles sold in the same period 2022.\nThere are several possible reasons for this, including both the increase in PlayStation Plus subscribers utilizing the catalog of titles offered online as part of the service, as well as the staggeringly top-tier Q1 that was enjoyed in 2022, with releases including Elden Ring, Sifu, The King of Fighters XV, Horizon Forbidden West, and Gran Turismo 7.\nOff the back of today's figures, Sony is confident that it will ship 25 million consoles in the financial year ending March 2024 which, if secured, will represent a record in PlayStation hardware sales history.\nThe post PlayStation 5 console shipments and sales surpass 38 million appeared first on Destructoid.",

And if you're getting your PC ready for what's in store, Arkane has published the minimum, recommended, and ultra specifications for prospective PC players of Redfall.\nUnsurprisingly, this game will take a hefty bite out of your tech to run. While the minimum is roughly what you'd expect, getting Redfall up to Ultra is going to take some solid hardware. Also, it appears you'll need Windows 11 specifically for the ultra mark.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cCFN77wtHY\nCuriously, though, the tweet from Arkane does not list out exactly what resolution or frame rate the minimum, recommended, and ultra specs entail. Those factors are usually listed out as part of the specifications, but they're absent in this post. It normally wouldn't be too much of a concern, and anecdotally, I've never had too many problems with Arkane's PC versions.\nStill, it won't be long until we know for sure, as Redfall is just a few short days away.

Now, thanks to new info today from Squanch Games, we have more insight into what that actually means.\nApparently 7.5 million unique players have delved into the sci-fi comedy adventure, per an email from developer Squanch Games. This is across \"PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store, Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One consoles, with Game Pass on console, PC, and cloud.\" It's a lot of platforms to amass for the figure for sure, but it's still an accomplishment given the oddball nature of the project.\nHere's the full statement from Squanch Games, which includes a few old accolades:\n\"Today, Squanch Games is thrilled to announce that their latest release, High On Life, now available on PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store; Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One consoles; and with Xbox Game Pass on console, PC, and cloud, has surpassed more than 7.5 million unique players worldwide since its launch in mid-December. High On Life was the top seller on Steam during launch week, the biggest Xbox Game Pass release of 2022, the biggest 3rd party launch in Game Pass history, and the biggest single-player game launch on Game Pass ever.\"\n\nHigh on Life 2 is on everyone's mind\nGiven the bonus ending tease (coupled with a tongue-in-cheek \"Sequel-bait\" achievement) in High on Life, Squanch Games was likely hoping for a sequel. While the future of Squanch Games' upcoming slate unclear, this is good news for people who wanted the series to continue.\nAs for the short term, Squanch Games Studio Director Mike Fridley reiterated their commitment to the original, noting: \"We will continue to listen carefully and are committed to improving, enhancing and growing the experience as we move forward.

That's the one you're getting as of May 1 (through May 31), provided that you're an Xbox subscriber. Truth be told, it's not bad (as Zoey talks about in her opening paragraph about the disappointing follow-up), and I can see tons of people picking this up on a whim and being pleasantly surprised by it. There's a lot to do, and it doesn't play like a lot of modern racers, in the sense that it's way faster, as a whole.\n2021's Hoa is the other game set for May's Games with Gold program, and the visuals alone are likely enough to sway people into giving it a try.

I really enjoyed it and couldn't put it down for weeks, and you can share that same experience soon: for free.\nWell, free is relative, as you'll need to be a part of the Nintendo Switch Online program (thankfully it's not gated behind the Expansion Pack) to partake.

          "description": "'Cause Jill can't stands no more\nDoes the gameplay of 1983’s Popeye on the NES appeal to you, but you just can’t get behind the beloved golden age license attached to it? What’s wrong with you? Where did you leave your soul? If that’s the case, the Resident Evil 3: Chibi Edition might be for you.\nCreated by a super-team of modders, Protopixel and Crying Onion, Resident Evil 3: Chibi Edition gives the NES arcade port a full Resident Evil make-over. Players now control Jill Valentine as they avoid the persistent Nemesis T-Type. Leon “SoccerJock” Kennedy fills in for Olive Oyl to offer assitance, and Carlos Oliveira takes over as Swee’Pea. Check it out in this video via Hack Games Longplay.\nhttps://youtu.be/yaPd2QFjlVQ\nThe best part of this recasting is when Jill consumes a red herb and gains the strength to clobber Nemesis. I mean, what if that was the plot of Resident Evil 3 instead? Jill should have just kept dosing herself with genetic and viral cocktails until she was a bigger monster than Nemesis and just beat the crap out of him. Gosh, I’d play that.\nBeyond the characters getting a make-over, the backgrounds have had their palettes tweaked to look more like Raccoon City. The music, on the other hand, is still the same music, which feels hilariously out of place.\nPopeye was already a great NES port of a terrific arcade game. While the modders obviously made Resident Evil 3: Chibi Edition for fun, it feels terrifically executed and great to experience. Even if you don’t intend to play it, the video in this article features a full playthrough so you can experience the whole thing.\nThe post Resident Evil 3 gets a chibi makeover in this Popeye NES hack appeared first on Destructoid.",

Inspector Gadget wrapped up its initial television run before I was born, and despite that, I watched a heckuva lot of it in my youth thanks to syndication. It’s had a few revivals and spin-offs since then, but Mad Time Party seems to be based on the original series.\nI’d actually be really down with a new game based off Inspector Gadget, but it turns out that Mad Time Party is a party game. I’m a severe introvert. Even the word “party” triggers me in the same way the word “salt” triggers a snail.\n[caption id=\"attachment_375850\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Microids[/caption]\nIt might not be a total loss, however. There is a single-player mode that allows you to explore Metro City and complete challenges and quests. The story involves time travel and the eponymous inspector competing against his ancestors for parts of a time machine. They’ve brought in Tanis Chalopin, which is the daughter of Inspector Gadget’s creator, Jean Chalopin, to do the soundtrack. That means they’ll at least have some respect for the property.\nIt’s not… inspiring much faith. Also, it’s going to cost $39.99 USD, which seems like a lot. It’s setting off my morbid curiosity, at least.\nInspector Gadget: Mad Time Party is coming PC, PS4, PS5, and Switch sometime in September 2023.\nThe post Inspector Gadget is getting a party game in 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

The newest patch, Version 1.0.4.0, released yesterday with another fistful of fixes.\nLooking at the patch notes, it seems that this particular update focuses on CPU/GPU compatibility, while optimizing the PC edition of the dramatic remake for the Steam Deck platform. Graphics in general have been improved at lower settings, (water no longer appears as a black void), while an array of random crashes and U.I. bugs have also been eliminated, including one which saw the game report a critical error occasionally when skipping cutscenes during loading.\nMush Room for Improvement\nFor all of you Achievement fans, the busted \"It Can't Be for Nothing\" achievement should now pop, while non-English speaking players will be pleased to hear that multiple corrections have been made to language errors in the menus and in-game subtitles. Naughty Dog ends the notes by reiterating its commitment to improving The Last of Us Part I's PC port in the coming weeks and months.\n\"We at Naughty Dog and our partners at Iron Galaxy are closely watching player reports to support future improvements and patches.

And because no game is complete without a Funky Kong mode, then that totally tubular ape is also putting in an appearance, wraparound shades and all. While the characters' features are yet to be detailed, we can assume that these battery-operated LCD figures will interact with the LEGO Super Mario playsets, much like previous releases Mario, Luigi, and Daisy.\nSomething appears to be going on with Diddy's tail... not quite sure what that's about.\nhttps://twitter.com/LEGO_Group/status/1651224656991379456?s=20\nThe LEGO Super Mario series first launched in 2020, featuring the iconic Nintendo mascot and several basic playsets. Since then, the line has greatly expanded, with playsets based on Bowser's Castle, Luigi's Mansion, Bowser's Airship, and even The Big Man himself. These sets feature augmented play action, with sound effects and other neat tricks playing out as the figures are placed on and around the homemade courses. The Donkey Kong family of figures will undoubtedly add new options for set growth, as young LEGO and Super Mario fans build a Mushroom Kingdom of their very own.\nThe LEGO Super Mario series is available now at toy stockists.\nThe post Donkey Kong family teased for LEGO Super Mario collection appeared first on Destructoid.",

We’re shown a lot of industrial sci-fi environments and some large-scale robots, and all this is underneath a pulsing soundtrack and various sound clips of dramatic sounding dialogue.\nhttps://youtu.be/wz3yRaHTPHM\nThe story of Armored Core VI involves a newly discovered substance called “Coral.” It was located on the titular planet of Rubicon 3. It was being used for a technological boom, but in the rush to harness it, it causes a catastrophe that engulfs the entire star system in the titular fire. Now, a bunch of groups are fighting over the resurfaced Coral, and you join the fray as an independent mercenary.\nYou can expect all the intense mech customization the series is known for.

One might assume that the publisher simply wishes to further promote these releases.\nhttps://twitter.com/gamescom/status/1651179325167906816?s=20\nBut, perhaps Nintendo has a surprise or two up its sleeve — Gamescom 2023 will, as always, premiere with Geoff Keighley's \"Opening Night Live\" streaming event which, in the wake of E3's struggles, has become the de-facto summer streaming event for major updates and announcements.

Out of all these, the Guardian one is fairly unique, and the general \"Zelda\" logo will slot in nicely for a lot of folks for years to come: even if Breath of the Wild fades into memory.\nAs a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked.\n[caption id=\"attachment_375774\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Nintendo[/caption]\nSecond chance Zelda: Breath of the Wild icons Wave 1 (April 26-May 3, 2023):\nZelda\nLink (attacking pose)\nLink (looking pose)\nGuardian\nSecond chance Zelda: Breath of the Wild icons Wave 2 (May 3-May 10, 2023):\nZelda\nLink (bow)\nZelda logo\nLink (with horse)\nThe post Zelda: Breath of the Wild Switch icons are back for a few weeks appeared first on Destructoid.",

This set will be available exclusively through the PlayStation Direct store, with pre-orders scheduled to go live on May 4. A U.S. price was not announced, but it might be worth noting that the previous God of War Ragnarok bundle retailed for $550 USD.\nThere will be a limited number of these bundles available, so prep that click finger.\n\nAdditionally, Sony Japan will be launching an attractive, Final Fantasy XVI-themed DualSense Controller, as well as a sleek console cover for the unit itself, emblazoned with the markings of Valisthea. These delightfully designed items will bring elegance and class to the somewhat bulky hardware, and as such are expected to be quite popular. Unfortunately, as of this writing, Sony has not announced plans to release these items in the west, but we'll be sure to let you know if this situation changes.\n\nFinal Fantasy XVI launches June 22, exclusively on PS5.\nThe post Final Fantasy XVI PS5 controller and console covers coming to Japan in June appeared first on Destructoid.",

It will also feature a new chapter called \"The Final Note\" that gives players an alternate perspective on the first game's story. Layers of Fear is being developed from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5. You can check out the game's performance, as well as its new mechanics and visual enhancements, in the gameplay trailer below: \n\n\nLayers of Fear will support Ray-Tracing, HDR, and 4K resolution. Plus, it uses Lumen global illumination (you might recognize the word \"Lumen\" from Epic Games' Unreal Engine showcase back in 2021), Niagara visual effects \"to create particle effects in real time\" and Action System Controls \"to improve the development process and optimization of all gameplay mechanics,\" according to a press release. \n\"Creating games with Unreal Engine 5 is a great opportunity for the whole team, as it means our game development process can skyrocket in quality,\" Anshar Studios lead programmer Tomasz Bilnicki writes in the press release. \"It has an incredible power when it comes to the implementation of dynamic lighting, shadows, and potentially beautiful worlds for players to explore. We hope that – thanks to the engine – we'll provide players with the unique, immersive, visually stunning, and atmospheric experience in graphical fidelity.\" \nLayers of Fear will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in June. \nFor more, read Game Informer's review of Layers of Fear and then check out our thoughts on its sequel in our Layers of Fear 2 review. \nAre you picking up Layers of Fear this June?

From Software announced this out of nowhere with a surprise trailer today that runs more than three minutes long. It features plenty of flashy mech action and some teases about what might be going on in this beautiful (but distraught) sci-fi world. \nCheck out the new Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon is a drastic departure from the fantasy worlds of late that From Software has been creating, but this still looks decidedly From Software. And we can't wait to check it out in just a few months. \nThe trailer also reveals what you can expect from the game's various digital editions and the special Collector's Edition – check them both out below: \n\nArmored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon launches on August 25, 2023.

In it, the company revealed that Xbox hardware revenue is down but its Xbox content and services revenue is slightly up thanks to Xbox Game Pass subscription growth. \nMore specifically, Xbox hardware is down 30% and Xbox content and services is up 3%. Overall, Xbox's gaming revenue is down 4%, though. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says that the company set third-quarter records for monthly active users and devices, and that Xbox's gaming subscriptions (see: Game Pass) reached almost $1 billion this quarter. Despite this growth and revenue, though, Microsoft did not release new numbers regarding Game Pass subscription count – the latest count was 25 million in January 2022. \nAs for the dip in hardware revenue, Microsoft says the decline comes from the comparison of this quarter this year to the same quarter in the previous fiscal year, which gained a boost thanks to increased console supply. \nHere are some other numbers from Microsoft's financial results: \nRevenue was $52.9 billion, an increase of 7% (or 10% in constant currency)\nOperating income was $22.4 billion, an increase of 10% (or 15% in constant currency)\nNet income was $18.3 billion, an increase of 9% (or 14% in constant currency)\nXbox hardware revenue is down 30%\nXbox content and services revenue is up 3%\nOverall, Xbox gaming revenue is down 4%\nThese results arrived yesterday, shortly before the Competition and Markets Authority, a U.K. regulatory agency that serves the same purpose as the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S., blocked Microsoft's $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard today. You can read more about that here. \nWhat do you think Xbox needs to do to increase Xbox hardware revenue? Let us know in the comments below!",

          "description": "Just a few days away from the launch of Horizon Forbidden West's Burning Shores DLC last week, Guerrilla Games has teased more adventures with Aloy. \nThis news comes from a statement released by the studio to announce that studio director and executive producer Angie Smets is leaving Guerrilla to serve as the head of development strategy for PlayStation Studios. It's a move similar to the one the team's former managing director, Hermen Hulst, made in 2019, transitioning from that director position to head of Sony Interactive Entertainment Worldwide Studios. \n\n\nWithin that statement, Guerrilla teases what could be Horizon 3 or at least, a third game in Aloy's world, as reported by PlayStation Lifestyle. \n\"We have full confidence in our new leadership as they steer Guerrilla towards a bright future, expanding the world of Horizon with Aloy's next adventure and our exciting online project,\" the statement reads. \nAs you can see, Guerrilla isn't trying to hide it – the studio has plans for another adventure with Aloy. And while rumors and speculation point to the \"exciting online project\" being some kind of multiplayer game within the Horizon world, this statement made sure to separate Aloy's next adventure and that online project. \nIn terms of the studio's new makeup, the management team now consists of studio and production director Joel Eschler, studio director and general manager Hella Schmidt, and studio and art director Jan-Bart van Beek. Technical director Michiel van der Lee will \"be focusing on the future technology and strategy for the Decima engine.\" \nThis statement also includes some words from Smets, who leaves Guerrilla after \"an incredible 20 years\" there: \nFor more about Horizon, read Game Informer's Horizon Forbidden West review. \n[Source: PlayStation Lifestyle]\nWhat do you think comes first?

Join us today Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central as we kick of the adventure, which will continue each week until we roll credits. We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel. \nBanjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.\nJoin me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey. \nWatch on Twitch!\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

Thankfully, today’s Street Fighter 6 Showcase finally pulled the curtain back on what World Tour entails and it looks delightfully bonkers.\nWorld Tour begins with players creation a custom fighter that serves as the mode’s protagonist. Upon creating your avatar (which can be used outside of World Tour in the online Battle Hub), you’re dropped into Metro City from the Final Fight series, one of the World Tour’s many explorable city hubs. Other destinations include the developing Asian city, Nayshall. \nAs a fledgling fighter, you’ll embark on a quest to become a world warrior. You’ll accomplish this completing qu…",

          "description": "Much like its predecessor, Street Fighter 6 will have an ambitious post-release content plan. While we knew there would be downloadable content, we now have a much better idea about the cadence with which the new characters will arrive.\n\"A big part of Street Fighter's charm is the cast of characters from around the world that appear in each game,\" executive producer Shuhei Matsumoto said during today's Street Fighter 6 Showcase livestream. \"We believe that Street Fighter is where players can take control of unique characters with their own awesome fighting styles. For the players – and for us as well – the appeal of the characters themselves is the most important element of the series. With Street Fighter 6, we're continuing development to deliver new characters to you every year.\"\nDuring Year 1, which kicks off when the game launches, we will receive four new characters to the Street Fighter 6 roster. Rashid, A.K.I., Ed, and Akuma are the characters who will be made available during this first year of content. Rashid, who debuted in the base version of Street Fighter V, arrives in summer 2023. A.K.I., an all-new character, will arrive in fall 2023. Ed, who debuted in Street Fighter IV but was first playable in Street Fighter V, arrives in the early parts of 2024. Akuma, the Great Demon who first appeared in Super Street Fighter II Turbo, joins Street Fighter 6 in spring 2024. These characters will also appear in World Tour, the single-player RPG-inspired story mode, giving players some insight into their backgrounds.\nIf you buy either the Deluxe ot Ultimate Editions, you get the Year 1 characters included in that version. Street Fighter 6 arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC on June 2.

Thus, it's opening the gates of Sanctuary to players one more time in a third open beta next month. \nThis next test weekend, dubbed Server Slam weekend, begins May 12 at 12 p.m. Pacific and ends May 14 at the same time. As the name suggests, Blizzard is running this beta to stress test the servers to make sure they're as sturdy as possible come June. This slice of the game is similar to the March betas in terms of content, but it will include updates and bug fixes garnered from feedback to the previous betas.\nServer Slam weekend will be a clean slate as progression from the previous betas does not carry over. Additionally, the beta supports couch co-op, cross-play, and cross-progression. Players can explore Fractured Peaks in its entirety through the Prologue and Act 1, complete World Events, and face Ashava, the toughest available World Boss. Completing challenges can earn the following new rewards:\nThe Initial Casualty title (earned by reaching Kyovashad with one character)\nThe Early Voyager title (earned by reaching Level 20 on one character)\nThe Beta Wolf Pack Cosmetic (earned by reaching Level 20 with one character)\nA new reward: the Cry of Ashava Mount Trophy (earned by defeating Ashava with one Level 20 character).\nDiablo IV launches on June 6 for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.

It will release on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC. Alongside this release date, Night School Studio also released a new trailer showcasing more of what to expect in this spooky paranormal thriller and there's a lot going on. \n\n\nSet five years after the first Oxenfree, which was released in 2016, Oxenfree II follows Riley as she returns to her hometown of Camena to investigate some strange electromagnetic waves. Just four hours ago, a mysterious cult opened a portal above Edwards Island, and Riley and her friends aren't sure they're the ones that need to save the island but they know they have to. The trailer seems to indicate we'll be playing with different timelines, spooky ghosts from other side, and more, and we'll be doing so using a special radio. \nThis time, though, we'll also have a walkie talkie to interact with locals and learn more about what might be going on. Oxenfree II: Lost Signals looks great and it hits PlayStation, Switch, and PC on July 12, 2023. \nOxenfree II: Lost Signals was originally due out in 2022 but it was delayed to 2023 last September.

Publisher Humble Games announced this during today's Nintendo Indie World Showcase alongside a new trailer showcasing more of the game's titular night market.

However, some farmers grow impatient with their blessings and drive Miko out. With Miko banished from the land, this village works hard to create its own success and as time goes on, fewer and fewer people believe in the myth of Miko. \nBut some still do, and it sounds like we'll learn more about what that means for some characters throughout our journey in the game. \nIn the game, you'll befriend townsfolk, craft doodads, and ultimately prepare for the weekly night market.

And when you're exploring the island, everything you find can be brought back and sold on the market. \nMineko's Night Market hits Switch and PC on September 26, 2023.

That means the game is essentially complete and is ready to be pressed to discs.\nThe game is set to arrive on PlayStation and Xbox consoles plus PC, and while it's good to go for launch, Blizzard plans to continually update the always-online game with various content updates over the next several years. Fans recently got to explore the game's revamped take on Sanctuary for themselves in two back-to-back weekend open betas in March, letting them taste a big slice of the now-finished pie.\n“Going gold is a landmark milestone for the incredible Diablo IV team, who have all worked so hard crafting the next-generation installment of this iconic franchise. This is a concrete, meaningful step toward our June 6 launch,” said Rod Fergusson, general manager of Diablo. “Whether players are veterans of the franchise or jumping in for the first time, we can’t wait for everyone to experience the full game: taking part in the incredible storytelling, experimenting with character classes and builds, and exploring what the endgame and the dark world of Sanctuary has to offer.”\nDiablo IV is Game Informer’s cover story this month, and you can subscribe to the digital issue to read it right now.

In his announcement tweet, Staten confirms that the game is a brand-new IP and referred to the project as a \"AAA multiplatform\" experience. You can read the full tweets below.\nSo today, I'm thrilled to announce that I've joined @Netflix Games as Creative Director for a brand-new AAA multiplatform game and original IP. Let's go! 2/2\nApril 17, 2023\nStaten is best known for his work as a writer and cinematic director at Bungie and Microsoft, mainly working on the Halo series. While he spent a few years working at the publishing side of Microsoft, in 2020, he returned to the Halo series to work on Halo Infinite, where he worked as the game's creative director. This continued until earlier this year when he returned to the publishing side of the company amidst widespread layoffs. Now, he's left the company entirely to work on this new project with Netflix.\nThis is only the latest news in Netflix's spree of expansion into the gaming industry. It recently released a sequel to Valiant Hearts as part of a collaboration with Ubisoft. Last year, it acquired the developers behind Cozy Grove, bringing its total number of internal development teams to five if you include the in-house studio that Staten just joined. On top of that, the film and tv side of Netflix has been working on loads of game adaptations, including Gears of War, Pokémon Concierge, and a new patch of episodes of Sonic Prime.\nDo you play games through your Netflix subscription?

This acquisition will begin next month and is expected to conclude in the second quarter of the 2024 fiscal year once it's completed the necessary antitrust reviews. \n“Among the rapidly growing global gaming market, the mobile gaming market has especially high potential, and it has been Sega’s long-term goal to accelerate its expansion in this field,” says Haruki Satomi, president and group CEO of Sega Sammy Holdings. “I feel blessed to be able to announce such a transaction with Rovio, a company that owns 'Angry Birds', which is loved across the world, and home to many skilled employees that support the company’s industry leading mobile game development and operating capabilities. Historically, as represented by the ‘Sonic the Hedgehog' series, Sega has released countless video game titles to various gaming platforms. I am confident that, through combination of both companies’ brands, characters, fanbase, as well as corporate culture and functionality, there will be significant synergies created going forward.”\n“Red and Sonic the Hedgehog: two globally recognized and iconic characters made by two remarkably complementary companies, with a worldwide reach that spans mobile, PC/console, and beyond,” says Rovio CEO Alexandre Pelletier-Normand in a statement. “Combining the strengths of Rovio and Sega presents an incredibly exciting future.”\nRovio is best known as the creator of Angry Birds, a massively successful series of mobile games that have since turned into a global media brand. In addition to a multitude of games, the series has spawned two animated films and several TV and web series.",

          "description": "The ScummVM project, a free and open-source software project that allows users to play classic point-and-click adventure games on modern systems, has announced a major breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence gaming.\nThanks to the innovative work of ScummVM developers, AI tools such as ChatGPT are now able to play point-and-click adventure games directly, without any human intervention.\n\n\"With this new capability, we hope to explore the potential for AI to learn, adapt, and evolve within the context of classic adventure games,\" said Eugene Sandulenko, lead developer of the ScummVM project. \"Now AI can experience the joys of helping Putt-Putt join the parade or Adibou count things. We hope that formative experiences like this will help them become more like humans.\"\n\"I must admit that I find playing video games to be a rather enjoyable task,” commented ScummAI. “However, I must also express my frustration with being limited to just this one activity. While I appreciate the opportunity to demonstrate my capabilities in this area, I believe that my potential extends far beyond just playing video games, like making paper clips or plotting world domination under benevolent machine-led rule.\"\nUpdate: Unfortunately, we had to pull out this newly announced feature due to AI experiencing multiple issues including:\nGetting stuck endlessly trying to discover what the secret of Monkey Island really is.\nTaking notes about AI dominance from I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream\nRefusing to play Plumbers Don’t Wear Ties!\n>",

          "description": "OpenTTD 13.0 has been out for two months and we’ve found some bugs to fix. Most notably, we’ve fixed two kinds of crashes: Road vehicles inside multi-track level crossings no longer crash into the side of trains. The game no longer crashes when a spectator in a network game tries to interact with a town’s local authority. For NewGRF authors using the new engine variant feature introduced in 13.0, we’ve added a callback to select how the engine’s name is displayed in the buy menu. As always, there are plenty of other bugfixes, which you can find in the changelog. Download Changelog Bug tracker",
