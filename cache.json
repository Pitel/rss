Pokémon Stadium was released on the Nintendo 64 in the year 2000 (1999 for Japan), and it arguably fulfilled every Pokéfanatic's dream by bringing everyone's favourite 151 critters to life in three dimensions.\nPokémon Stadium's gameplay was as many expected it to be: the conventional turn-based battle formula using the familiar creatures from the Game Boy games, but now in breathtaking 3D. It was definitely something to behold at the time, for fans of the series only really had the manga, anime, and the sprites from Pokémon Red, Blue, and Yellow to visualise each Pokémon in all their glory during battle.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Strider Too.\nFollowing his departure from Capcom, director Kouichi Yotsui was burdened with expectation following Strider's success. Sadly, despite his inventive, risk-taking approach to game development, he would never again win the limelight. In the mid-'90s he had a fling with Mitchell Corporation, a studio formed of ex-Capcom staff that coaxed him into creating a spiritual sequel to Strider. Known as Cannon Dancer in Japan and Osman internationally, it failed to garner enough attention to warrant a home port. 27 years on, and that injustice has finally been rectified.\nTaking a leaf out of Strider's rich aesthetic tapestries, Cannon Dancer trades out dystopic Russia for the warmer climes of a futuristic Middle East; a bristling metallic skyline gilded with neon, mile-high searchlights, and a fusion of Turkish and Arabian embellishments. In real-world history, Osman was the name of the founder of Turkey's Ottoman Empire, which may indicate where Yotsui's fictitious world sits geographically.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Mega Man, Execute!\nIn the early 2000s, an ancient and long-forgotten era when Capcom regularly released new Mega Man games, the company decided to produce not one, but two mainline Mega Man series on the popular Game Boy Advance. Mega Man Zero would continue the gameplay and storyline that the previous action platforming franchises were famous for, while another series—Mega Man Battle Network—would be set in its own world and follow an all-new RPG template. It was an unconventional idea, but Capcom quickly showed the value of its vision for these games, and now they’ve been brought back in their finest form yet under the Mega Man Battle Network Collection.\nAvailable split across two volumes on the Switch eShop or on a physical cart with all 10 games, the collection includes the original GBA game and its sequel, and then each pair of subsequent sequels. So, 3 Blue and White, 4 Red Sun and Blue Moon, 5 Team Protoman and Team Colonel, and 6 Cybeast Gregar and Cybeast Falzar.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

While the two films followed humans who made their way to The Grid, TRON: Identity is a visual novel that offers a look at how programs interact when there aren’t any humans around to interfere.\nTron: Identity casts players in the role of Query, a Disciple of Tron who is tasked with discovering the truth behind an explosion. The game does a solid job of casting Query into the classic role of the hard-boiled detective. Though he is significantly less hard-drinking and aggressive than the likes of Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe, that is certainly the vein of fiction that Bithell Games (Thomas Was Alone, Subsurface Circular, John Wick Hex) mined for inspiration, right down to the near-constant rain that falls on the dark streets of The Grid.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

But now that The Super Mario Bros. Movie is here, all of a sudden, we care.\nNo longer is Mario just a character that we control, but we've seen another side to him thanks to Illumination and Nintendo's film. We've seen that has a life of his own outside of the games. With this comes questions that we might not have asked after playing, say, Super Mario Odyssey: what are his hobbies?

          "description": "Frogwares are in a bit of a tight spot at the moment, being as they are a Ukranian studio. If I was trying to make video games in a warzone and: a) my last game was a big sexy prequel to my long running Sherlock Holmes series; b) the one before that was a Lovecraftian detective game with pretty recent assets; and c) my back catalogue contained a Lovecraft-themed Sherlock Holmes mystery, then I'd probably do what they've done with Sherlock Holmes The Awakened. Which is to remake the old Lovecraft-themed Sherlock Holmes game, but with new assets.\nIt's also got new puzzles and areas, and a slightly rewritten story to account for this being a sequel to Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One. It's a smaller, less ambitious game than Chapter One with some jank knocking around, and I wouldn't recommend it if you're not a fan of the series, but you know what? I think there's a glimmer of greatness in the very fact of its constraints.\nRead more",

So, The Tank he lived, and also died. Questing endlessly in this grimy medieval world won’t cut it. You’ll also need to keep your troupe paid and fed, so when evening fell to find nought but a handful of foraged mushrooms and a single mouldy apple I’d pried from the fingertips of a disemboweled bandit, it was time to get creative.\n“Waste not, want not”, said the Earl of Human Sandwich, the inventor of cannibalism (I’m told). With this in mind, I’d invested one of my early ‘Knowledge Points’ into a tech that let me repurpose my dearly departed as delicious drumsticks. Slain friendlies don’t disappear after battle. Instead, you’ll find their tastefully dressed corpses in the loot menu afterwards. Ghoulishly, the ‘loot all’ option doesn’t add their cadavers to your inventory with the rest. You’ll have to manually drag them over, giving you just enough time to consciously make the decision to either bury or eat them. I did not bury him.\nRead more",

Featuring quotes from Jesper Kyd, Takeshi Furukawa and Yuji Naka, it's clear that Sakamoto's influence on the way games sound cannot be understated.\n Read more",

Which is strange, since Muv-Luv is considered by many to be one of the most greatest visual novels of all time. What begins as a light-hearted slice-of-life high school romantic comedy eventually pulls the rug out from under the player, and transforms into a war epic featuring mechs and aliens with a much darker tone. In Muv-Luv’s original Japanese release, this twist was hidden and only briefly hinted at in the marketing.\nToday both Muv-Luv games are easily available on Steam, marketed specifically with this twist, and where they sit fully-translated and with Overwhelmingly Positive reviews. iOS and Android ports are apparently in development, and other Muv-Luv spin-offs continue to get translated. But the first time anyone experienced a complete English language version of Muv-Luv was in July 2010, when a fan translation group called Amaterasu released a patch localising the first game.\nRead more",

          "description": "Look, I’m not saying Far Cry 3 is responsible for *gestures vaguely towards modern AAA games* but it’s definitely a prime suspect. If I was trying to connect a piece of red string from the middle of my evidence board (which would probably be a picture of the map screen from Assassin’s Creed Valhalla), I’m not sure I’d push a pin directly into Jason Brody’s face, but I’d definitely circle it in black Sharpie a few times. Basically, in the eleven years since its release, I’ve grown a bit suspicious of Far Cry 3’s lasting legacy. \r\n\n\r\nAnd yet, in those halcyon days of 2012, we named it our game of the year. Although it’d be easy to simply say that decision was made a bit before my time here, I should probably admit that when reviewing the game for the blog I used to run when I was at university, I awarded it an equally prestigious (stop laughing at the back) 10/10. That almost seems ludicrous, doesn’t it? Far Cry 3? Game of the year? Surely not.\r\n\n\r\nAfter spending a few hours revisiting the sunny shores of Rook Island, I was shocked to discover a game that feels surprisingly pure. Mechanically, I hasten to add. The actual act of playing Far Cry 3 in 2023 is still good fun, it’s the bits around it that are a bit ropey.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "There's a moment in BioShock Infinite's opening act that's always stuck with me. As you emerge onto the floating city of Columbia, the game takes you on a guided tour of the sights and sounds of this airbone civilization. As you saunter through the streets, you learn about its citizens and its creator, just sort of taking it all in. The sun is shining. You're surrounded by smiles. Before you know it, an airship rises above the clouds and perches next to a hugging couple, gently swaying in the summer breeze. Aboard the ship is a barbershop quartet, cheerfully harmonising the iconic Beach Boys tune God Only Knows. It's a memorable scene, and has become an integral part of the game's lasting iconography. \r\n\n\r\nBut for Tyler, Nick, Derek and Greg, this section was more than just a fun tease for the secret behind Columbia's unusual success. Self-confessed music school kids, the quartet inspired them to create their own musical group styled after Infinite's singing hairdressers. In 2023, BioShop Infinite celebrated their ninth year at PAX East, where they performed a wonderful collection of harmonised tunes to an absolutely packed community room - and we were there to film it.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Still, it seems a slightly odd move, because Road 96 - a first person hitchhiking choose 'em up about the collective action of wayward teens bringing down a totalitarian government - doesn't really need a prequel. On top of that, Road 96: Mile 0 is a sequel to developer DigixArt's first game Lost In Harmony, a musical runner about skateboarder Kaito whose fiend Aya is dying of a terminal illness.\nIn Mile 0, Kaito and his family have moved to a small gated town called White Sands, in the 90s USA-adjacent dictatorship Petria, and made best friends with Zoe, who 96ers will remember as a recurring NPC from that game. Zoe is the daughter of an important minister and lives in the nice part of town; Kaito's parents are workers who are forced to live on the wrong side of the tracks. Through a combination of Road 96-style character-driven vignettes and Lost In Harmony-style rhythm action tracks, the two come to the conclusion they must leave White Sands. If you played Road 96 you kind of already know how Mile 0 has to end.\nRead more",

          "description": "Ask RPS returns today with a question that takes us right back to the beginning of how we all got here. Not in the scientific, evolutionary sense of all of human history, I should add, but rather how we, the RPS Treehouse, ended up writing about video games for a living.\nThe question comes courtesy of Bloodyhell, who asked: When did you know that you not only wanted to play games, but to write about what you played? And, does writing about games ever dampen your enthusiasm when you are dealing with deadlines and putting words on a page?\nA sneaky double-part question, there, but both good questions nonetheless. So come and find out our collective origin stories, and whether any of us have cried tears of pain and regret over the years after turning our favourite hobby into an actual job.\nRead more",

It's a promise of all the myriad adventures to come. And despite some fundamental changes in genre and perspective, it's something that the team behind the upcoming Minecraft Legends has tried hard to preserve.\nI recently was treated to the most in-depth look so far at Minecraft Legends, in an hour-long livestream which gave us all some much needed answers on what manner of beast Legends actually is. It's a curious blend of action adventure and RTS, one that shares Minecraft's focus on exploration, but guides the player down a stricter, simpler path of summoning friendly mobs and constructing defences to repel a Piglin invasion. This will likely be a solid introduction to the RTS genre for a lot of players, but I came away unsure about whether the game will have enough depth to keep its prospective playerbase's attention.\nRead more",

I was having an early sneak peak at Inkle's new game A Highland Song in an appointment booth with paper-thin walls and no ceiling. The speakers on my Steam Deck demo unit were really going \"full pipe\" that day, so I'd like to say a big awkward sorry to any of my neighbours in there who were trying to conduct actual serious business interviews. \nBut also: A Highland Song is 100% a game that deserves to have its music cranked up to full, whether it's returning Heaven's Vault composer Laurence Chapman's soaring orchestral score, or Scottish bands Talisk and Fourth Moon's aforementioned folk music. The clue's in the name, after all, and after a spirited 30 minutes with it, I'm certain this will have Inkle fans singing from the hilltops.\nRead more",

          "description": "When Marek Markuszewski had finished working on The Witcher 3's Blood And Wine expansion, he wanted to go back to basics and make something by himself, Starward Industries' chief marketing officer Maciej Dobrowolski tells me at GDC. Something that would capture the same kind of cultural Polish heritage as The Witcher - originally adapted from Andrzej Sapkowski's six-strong series of novels - but that would take him on a new, more introspective kind of development journey. It took a while to find, but after a fateful encounter with an investor who'd just sailed across the Atlantic with only a copy of Polish sci-fi writer Stanislaw Lem's The Invincible for company, the signs were too good to ignore, Dobrowolski says. And after spending the best part of a year convincing Stanislaw Lem's son (and current rights holder) of the same thing, Markuszewski finally had his something - and a new partner to help him realise it.  \n\"People tell us, 'Don't fuck it up, this guy's important,'\" Dobrowolski continues, and no wonder. During the course of our conversation, Lem is described as both a \"national treasure\" and \"mandatory reading in high school\" for Polish students, and his hallowed cultural status is something the team's \"had to deal with\" in bringing the book to life. Despite all this, though, Dobrowolski insists this \"isn't a one-to-one adaptation\" of Lem's interstellar rescue story gone wrong, and that fans of the book will still find some surprises on the surface of Regis III as they explore its strange canyons, caves and crash sites.\nRead more",

It's not the first game that comes to mind as a favourite or recommendation, but it's a plain good time. Raidborn is one of those.\nIt doesn't try to take over your life, or be the Everything Game that invariably becomes the Nothing Game. It's just a neat little thing to have some harmless fun with. Sometimes that's what you want.\nRead more",

Most of them we managed to make videos for, but there were many more that we just didn't have the time to cover, and that were also very good! So here's a quick list of five more games I wanted to spotlight in written form while Liam's busy in the editing mines working on all the community videos we filmed (the first of which is out right now, chronicling the PAX Facebook group that takes a community photo every single year). It's very wholesome. We've got more community videos coming out this week, plus an article listing our absolute favourite games we played throughout the entire event, so keep your eyes peeled for those, too.

After playing four hours of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor last week, I can tell you it is exactly what you probably already thought it would be: a competent, big-budget action-adventure sequel, well made by talented people, that isn't breaking the mould but expands upon the first game in the areas you liked best. If, like myself, you enjoyed Jedi: Fallen Order, this will probably be a solid follow-up for you. But if you were less well disposed towards that first game, you'd probably want to swap \"consistent\" for the word \"predictable\".\nRead more",

          "description": "Graham (RPS in peace) text me yesterday and, with little warning, launched into what were clearly pre-prepared paragraphs of complaints about games he'd tried playing in his free time at the weekend and not enjoyed. I shall draw a veil of discretion over the names of the actual games, but his chief complaint was that none of them had, actually, very robust design or tutorialising fit for purpose (i.e. teaching you how to play the game), especially for people who aren't able to give games their singular attention for hours at at time. I agree with him, although his attention is divided by, e.g., having a child in need of stimulation, and mine is divided by, e.g., being a child in need of stimulation.\nIt's probably turning my brain into cottage cheese, but I often do things at the same time as playing a game, like listening to music or a podcast. I understand that podcast games are sort of a genre now, but I've started doing it with regular games. Is this a me problem? Sure. Does it mean I want games to bring back that thing where NPC quest givers will just explain the quest again to you if you ask? 100% also yes.\nRead more",

Jediná přípustná praktika byla, že se mikrokód CPU nahraje standardně ještě před startem operačního systému, jak se sluší a patří. Nyní AMD ale hlásí, že práce jsou hotovy a na současných procesorech AMD lze považovat pozdní nahrávání mikrokódu CPU u již běžících linuxových systémů za důvěryhodné a bezpečné.

It's an area we'll likely see Intel continue to invest in as Sierra Forest comes next year with 144 E cores per socket. Already with the Linux kernel patches Intel is carrying at the moment via their in-house distribution, there are some significant benefits for Xeon Scalable Sapphire Rapids. I was curious to see how this Intel-focused work impacted AMD EPYC servers and thus in today's article is a similar analysis using two AMD EPYC 9654 \"Genoa\" flagship processors while evaluating Intel's Linux kernel optimizations.",

          "description": "And you better bring some Aero the Acro-Bat\nRetro publisher Sunsoft, the studio behind 16-bit franchises such as Aero the Acro-Bat and Zero the Kamikaze Squirrel, has announced that it intends to hold its second \"Sunsoft is BACK\" live stream next week, featuring more information on the resurrected publisher's upcoming releases.\nSunsoft's first comeback stream, which was held in August of last year, saw the dormant studio announce a selection of new titles for the Japanese market, including the revival of '80s strategy series Ikki Unite, a remaster of 1992 platformer Gimmick!, and a rerelease of 1991 Famicom adventure Ufouria: The Saga — One of the games in the cult Hebreke franchise. In addition to these announcements, Sunsoft also teased that it had a full remake in the works, but is yet to offer up the identity of the mystery title.\nNext week's stream is expected to feature new information pertaining to the above titles, and will perhaps see Sunsoft finally lift the lid on the teased remake. Of course, we may find that the studio is only planning to continue its focus on the Japanese market and some of its more obscure IPs, but it's still interesting to see the long-forgotten studio make its presence felt some 20-30 years later. We will, of course, bring you all of the news from the stream right here on Destructoid, so stay tuned, folks.\nThe \"Sunsoft is Back\" live stream kicks off April 20 at 15:00 JST / 07:00 BST / 23:00 PT.\nThe post Sunsoft to hold its second ‘comeback’ stream next week appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Are you the keymaster?\nSecret Mode has announced that it’s bringing Sumo Digital Academy’s revival of the Amiga almost-classic Zool Redimensioned to PlayStation consoles on May 16, 2023.\nZool was originally released in 1992 on the Commodore Amiga before being ported to other consoles. Despite its availability on different platforms, it’s largely considered to be an Amiga cornerstone. 2021’s Zool Redimensioned was a ground-up remake that bases itself on the Amiga version. It features widescreen support, which is a pretty revolutionary change, considering it was a game that would sometimes punish quick movements.\nhttps://youtu.be/xTEsWEeVGm8\nI enjoyed it for what it was. It was a worthwhile update, but I don’t really think about Zool Redimensioned all that often anymore. In my review, I called it a “comfortable slice of ‘90s platforming,\" which still sounds appropriate to me now. Good call, past me.\nAlong with this port comes multiplayer in the form of party modes Zool’s Gold, Rool of Zool, and Ball Brawl. Not much has been shown off about them. The trailer shows off Rool of Zool, but it’s hard to really make out what’s happening. I see bosses though, so it kind of looks fun. The patch will also be coming to the existing PC version. My family won’t play platformers with me because I exist on a higher plain of skill in that genre. Every genre, really, but don’t tell them I said that.\nZool Redimensioned is currently available on PC, and will be making its way to PS4 and PS5 on May 16.\nThe post Zool Redimensioned is coming to PlayStation consoles May 16 appeared first on Destructoid.",

This is coming April 18, 2023, which is just around the corner, so you won’t have to wait long. This patch will be followed by another free content pack every quarter, including a “seasonal” one. While that will probably be Christmas Themed, I’d love to power-wash the feathers off a turkey.\nhttps://twitter.com/PowerWashSim/status/1646151201237393412?s=20\nAlong with this is three paid DLC packs for Powerwash Simulator. They haven’t really said much on what those will involve, but they do say that they will take you outside the fictional county of Muckington to “all sorts of new and exciting places.” Space? The bottom of the ocean? How does a power washer work in a pressurized environment? Like normal, I’m guessing.\nThe biggest wink, however, is just “exciting news.” Ooo. I bet it’s VR, which really isn’t exciting to someone like me. Someone who doesn’t own a VR headset.\nThere’s also a physical version of the game on the way for consoles. I say “physical,” but the Switch version is just a download key, which is just… I don’t see the point. I should totally buy my dad the PS4 version, though.\nI love Powerwash Simulator, though. It’s like a less janky version of Viscera Cleanup Detail. I can barely keep my kitchen clean, but you can bet I’ll get every nook and cranny if you give me points for it.\nPowerwash Simulator is available for PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, PS4, PS5, and Switch.\nThe post Futurlab shares its Powerwash Simulator roadmap for 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

So relatable. That’s how Flooded begins.\nFlooded describes itself as a reverse city builder. What it means is that the world is currently undergoing flooding of biblical proportions, and you need to survive in small pockets of land, finish up your objectives, and escape before there’s no land left to dry your socks on. I wasn’t sure if this concept was really going to work for me, but now that I’ve played through Flooded, I realize that its design is not only palatable, but actually somewhat brilliant.\n[caption id=\"attachment_373383\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot by Destructoid[…",

          "description": "The added frames will be in a later update\nRedfall will have options for either Quality or Performance on Xbox, but only one will be available at launch. Arkane confirms that Redfall will be launching with just the Quality option, and Performance mode will be arriving in an update after launch.\nNo date was specified in the announcement, just that it would arrive through a game update sometime later. So for Xbox Series X|S owners, Quality mode will be the sole option. Here's what you get on each platform with that:\nXbox Series X: 4K / 30 FPS\nXbox Series S: 1440p / 30 FPS\nNo resolution targets were listed for Redfall's Performance mode, but it will be the 60 FPS setting, for those who like their frames.\nhttps://twitter.com/playRedfall/status/1646158836103880708\nThe streets run red\nFor those who prefer the crispy 60 FPS over higher resolutions, this is a bit of a bummer. I usually opt for the Performance mode whenever possible, and knowing there will eventually be an option for it honestly makes me consider holding off for a while.\nRedfall does look really fun, to be fair. I've enjoyed the general theme and idea of it, it's looked solid in various trailers, and I'm a pretty big fan of Arkane's previous games. All of it seems set up for success.\nYet Redfall is also launching into a highly competitive window for attention. It arrives just after Star Wars Jedi: Survivor and just before The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. It may hold the benefit of being a multiplayer experience, whereas those other games are solo adventures, but it's still a stacked spring by any standard.\nHopefully Arkane can get this mode out the door fast. Having all the frames I can for vampire hunting will be helpful. Redfall launches on May 2, 2023 for PC and Xbox Series X|S.\nThe post Redfall on Xbox will get its 60 FPS Performance mode in a post-launch update appeared first on Destructoid.",

Not to say that it'll never return! In fact, I suspect a lot of folks will be comparing and contrasting the two worlds with magnifying glasses, and Breath of the Wild will still live on for many years (decades even).\nOn that note, let's look at this awesome trick shot from Twitter user ambi. One-upping many of the \"rising up in the sky\" trick shots, ambi uses the Master Cycle Zero to flip up in the air, then blow up three (hurt) Guardians simultaneously. Of course, it even has the killer finisher with the cycle: which is just behind the all-time greatest anime style finisher of walking away from an explosion.\nI'm a huge fan of Master Cycle Zero anything, and thankfully, folks can seemingly create their own vehicles on a whim in Tears of the Kingdom. It's weird to think of how Nintendo will follow up Tears of the Kingdom with DLC: and I hope it's slightly different than how Breath of the Wild was handled. Maybe we'll get a huge proper non-shrine/challenge room-centric expansion this time?\nhttps://twitter.com/aquatic_ambi/status/1644069088677998592\nThe post Here’s another wild Zelda: Breath of the Wild trick shot for the road appeared first on Destructoid.",

The preview, which you can check out below, sees Redfield siblings Chris and Claire team up with former R.P.D. officer Leon S. Kennedy, S.T.A.R.S. Bravo team medic Rebecca Chambers, and — the Master of Unlocking herself — Jill Valentine. A pretty exciting team-up for the community, that's for sure, and one that frankly should have happened as the theme of Resident Evil 4.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThmEKGQC_s8&ab_channel=KADOKAWAanime\nIt should be noted that the trailer is, putting it mildly, fucking bonkers. Following on from some Tom Cruise-esque motorbike stunt silliness, we see our heroes battle flesh-eating zombies, undead sharks, and T-Virus packing Lickers on a deserted Alcatraz Island. At one point, Chris Redfield casually arms himself with a rocket launcher like it's nothing, and a hilarious moment sees the team attempt to one-up each other while dodging a mutated tentacle. Silly? Very. Kinda cruddy looking? That too...\nThe true sequel to Resident Evil 3? Absolutely.\nResident Evil Death Island will premiere in Japan July 7, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment has picked up the rights for a western release, and the film is expected to release in North America and Europe later in 2023.\nThe post Resident Evil Death Island trailer gets the band back together appeared first on Destructoid.",

Sony confirms the new RPG will be getting a new update this week on April 13.\nThe new State of Play will air on Sony's Twitch and YouTube channels on April 13, at 5 p.m. ET / 2 p.m. PT. The show will feature \"more than 20 minutes\" of new Final Fantasy XVI footage.\nhttps://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1645894612693688320\nThe PlayStation blog doesn't note any specifics, aside from touching on the general dark fantasy setting and battles between the Eikons and Dominants. Though the blog says the showcase will dive into \"all this and more,\" it's fair to say this will center solely on Final Fantasy XVI.\nThe state of play for PlayStation\nThis is the second State of Play for Sony so far in 2023, though this is their first single-game-focused event. The February 2023 State of Play put a bunch of PS VR2 titles in the spotlight, as well as updates on Destiny 2's then-upcoming Lightfall, the release date for Baldur's Gate 3, and more footage of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League.\nFor Final Fantasy XVI, this make a fair bit of sense, as the next entry in the series first premiered at a Sony showcase back in 2020. I'm curious to see what's new to show in Final Fantasy XVI, as we did just recently get a good look at the game. Alongside a bevy of new footage, we also got some hands-on time with the upcoming action-RPG, which definitely aims for a darker fantasy setting. For more on that, check out our interview with the project's leads.\nI'm curious to see what Square Enix and Sony will be showing now, and how it differs from the late February preview we got. Final Fantasy XVI isn't far off now. Whatever June 22 may hold, we'll get a pretty decent new glimpse of it on Thursday.\nThe post Sony is airing a Final Fantasy XVI State of Play this week appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Infernax: Deux or Die goes above and beyond\nMy love of Infernax is no secret by this point. Many indie titles have shot for NES nostalgia, but Infernax provides an experience that genuinely belongs among the console’s best. Its tight gameplay, compact map to explore, and authentic difficulty curve drives home the feeling of playing a version of Simon’s Quest that became a beloved classic instead of a series black sheep. Add in a host of secret characters and multiple endings, and you have a game just begging to be replayed.\nI gleefully put in at least three runs through Infernax last year, yet the announcement of couch co-op via the Deux or Die update still peaked my curiosity. As much as I love this game, couch co-op updates to single games have left me underwhelmed in the past. For examp…",

And this time around it's the turn of the Red Cyclone himself, The Iron Body, weighing in at 399 pounds and hailing from Mother Russia, it's Zangief!\nZangief - R.E.D.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6caXwwXbjk&ab_channel=StreetFighter\nAs is the case for almost all of the new Street Fighter 6 themes, Zangief's new tune has something of an underground, garage-mix flavor. But that doesn't mean that the tune doesn't open up to the unmistakable sounds of Slavic culture. There's also a clear element of threat and danger to Zangief's tune, which puts fear back into a character that has, for far too long, been played off as something of a comedy character. And, given the devastating nature of the gameplay footage we've seen of The Iron Body in action, The Street Fighter 6 iteration of Zangief is going to be no laughing matter.\nOf the scrapper's launch roster, we now need only hear the themes for Delta Red agent Cammy and club-swinging Mexican newcomer Lily, and our litany of character themes are complete. I'll admit, I fully understand the divisive nature of Street Fighter 6's \"sound\", but while some of the tunes leave something to be desired, I do prefer these themes to those of Street Fighter V and feel that the overall audial style is fitting with the new sequel's visual aesthetic.\nStreet Fighter 6 launches June 2 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox. Be sure to check out the themes for Ryu, Chun-Li, Luke, and Jamie, Juri and Kimberly, Blanka and Dhalsim, DeeJay and JP, and Manon, and Marisa.\nThe post Check out Zangief’s new entrance theme for Street Fighter 6 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Thankfully, it sounds like that’s the plan, as Disney Games Producer Heidy Vargas has said in an interview with d23 that this is just the start of their collaboration with developer Bithell Games.\nIt comes at the very end of the interview that Vargas states:\n“There are a few other projects in the works that I can’t mention yet, but of course, TRON: Identity is the start of Bithell Games’ collaboration with Disney on TRON-dedicated games. Players can expect more TRON titles to come in the future.”\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_373244\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot by Destructoid[/caption]\nTron: Identity is a pretty excellent take on the property. It takes the setting and applies some new genres of storytelling to it. It comes away with its own unique, uh, identity within the property. It’s also a tight and experimental little visual novel that does what it needs to without any superficial fluff to extend runtime.\nMore than that, though, it’s obvious that Bithell Games was very excited to work with the property. That love and affection shine through in the finished game, and part of my enthusiasm is essentially vicarious excitement for the dev team being able to pursue this passion further. You can sign me up for seeing more of it.\nTron: Identity releases today on April 11, 2023.

          "description": "Identity Crisis\nMy introduction to Tron was actually through Monolith Production’s 2003 FPS, Tron 2.0. It was a great game and an unfortunate way to dive in. I later watched Tron and was disappointed that Tron 2.0’s nuanced and deep interpretation of the inner world of computers wasn’t informed by the storytelling from the 1982 film.\nThat’s not to say Tron isn’t worthwhile. It’s an imaginative setting that feels like an archaic interpretation of what computers would eventually be. Tron: Identity is an unassuming approach to that universe. It’s a visual novel and decidedly a small project made out of love for the property. Playing it, you can almost sense the excitement Bithell Games had for developing the title, and that goes a long way in making Tron: Identity a worthwhile title.\n[caption…",

As is often the case with teasers, no gameplay is shown, but we at least get to see a guy guzzle down coffee moments after it’s poured for him.

The company has announced that Nintendo Live 2023 is heading to Seattle, Washington sometime this September.\nPrevious events have been held in Japan, but this Live event is heading to the U.S. this time. The in-person event will host gameplay, live stage shows, tournaments, photo opportunities, and more.\nFor this Seattle event, Nintendo says there will be a \"large-scale themed area\" for all ages, with the experience designed with \"both families and fans\" in consideration.\nMore details, including the exact timing and location, will be shared sometime in the future.\nVia the Nintendo site, there will be opportunities to play games with friends or at your own pace. Or you can watch some competitions in unspecified games, take pics with Nintendo characters, or check out sculptures that bring those worlds to life.\nFor a better idea of what's in store, here's the Animal Crossing x Splatoon live concert from Nintendo Live 2022.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ETszC6w-mg\nNintendo's party\nSo yes, it's a big Nintendo fan event held in Seattle. It's probably worth keeping expectations in check for this being some kind of E3 show, as this is usually a more fan-focused affair. Music? Gameplay? Tournaments? All still there.\nMeanwhile, the summer of games is adjusting to a world without E3, as the ESA is skipping the festivities this year. Nintendo wasn't planning on going, but also hasn't locked in any Directs around that time as of writing. Granted, the company is coming off a big movie debut, and gearing up for the launch of Tears of the Kingdom. Hopefully we'll hear more about any summer streaming plans soon.\nThe post Nintendo Live 2023 is heading to Seattle this September appeared first on Destructoid.",

Double-timing to a popular charge corridor on the \"Inferno\" map, sp1cay tosses a flash to cover his approach before switching to the powerful AWP sniper rifle, noticing movement, sp1cay fires off a single round which, in a moment worthy of Tom Berenger, (or I guess John Wick for you, junior), headshots all five members of the opposing team, whose ill-fated noodles happened to be in alignment.\nCheck out the moment in the video below. As it's a multiplayer shooter, prepare for NSFW dialogue.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=Z899M4v2NL8&ab_channel=sp1cay\nReferenced by Jake Lucky as a \"once in a lifetime\" shot, the wild one bullet Ace quickly spread throughout the CS:GO community, (naturally bringing folk out of the woodwork to claim that they \"do this at least once a day\".) Lucky notes that he plans to interview sp1cay about the cool clip at a later date, as the player went on vacation the next day — like your average hitman would after completing an assignment. Peyowww!\nIf you fancy checking out CS:GO for yourself, now is as good a time as any, as developer Valve has recently announced plans to launch a revamped Counter Strike 2 this coming summer.

Its twisted tale is that of an expert games player who finds themselves delving deeper and deeper into the strange lore behind a mysterious and seemingly long-abandoned card game, the roots of which delve far deeper than one could ever imagine.\nhttps://twitter.com/devolverdigital/status/1645468836605329433?s=20\nUpon release, Inscryption was highly praised for its creepy visual style, unnerving atmosphere, and smart blending of narrative, strategic gameplay, and metaphysical nature. Inscryption would go on to sell over a million copies and bag numerous awards, including the prestigious Game of the Year award from the Game Developers Conference. This new Xbox port will only serve to further invite more victims/players into its weird, soul-staining world, and is definitely worth a look for anyone who enjoys deck-building titles with a strong slant on the mysterious and macabre.\nInscryption is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.\nThe post Creepy card-battler Inscryption now available on Xbox platforms appeared first on Destructoid.",

Unfortunately, significant technical and process challenges prevent us from continuing support for this platform, and we believe this is the best choice for Rogue Company.\"\nHi-Rez notes that it intends to fully focus its efforts on the PlayStation, PC, and Xbox versions of Rogue Company going forward. The studio suggests that Switch players utilize the Hi-Rez account linking/cross-progression service in order to continue playing on another platform with all of the content and statistics from their Switch edition.\nRogue Company launched in open beta in late 2020, before finally receiving an official release in May 2022. It is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms, with tentative plans for a mobile port.\nThe post Rogue Company ends service on Nintendo Switch June 20 appeared first on Destructoid.",

I'd heard some rumblings here and there, but after a few friends talked me into it and I saw the fairly cheap price tag, I figured I'd give it a shot. Co-op roguelite with some vague whiffs of dungeon-crawling sounded like a good time.\nAnd it is, as it turns out, a good time. Passtech Games, the studio you might best know for its work on Curse of the Dead Gods, has something here with Ravenswatch. It's visually appealing, clever and evolving, with some good variety run-over-run. My only hang-up is that there isn't a lot here right now, either.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmzNnZZOsxY\nRunning up that hill\nRavenswatch lets you pick from several classic characters from myths and fables, like the …",

It starts off with this big dude and Kyle Travers pointing guns at each other in a cutscene. The fight starts and I unload said pistol at the guy, and it does basically nothing. His health bar is cut down by an amount that would be offensive to the whole clip of bullets I put into him. So I ditch it and beat him up with fists.\nAs I’m fighting him, guns just keep dropping out. He’d fall down, drop his pistol, get back up, reach behind himself, and reveal a new pistol.

The animated adaptation of Nintendo’s flagship franchise has emerged from its first weekend as the best opening animated film of all time, achieving several other records along the way. \nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, the film walked away with over $375 million in sales in its first five days, surpassing Frozen 2 as the top opening animated film premiere globally. That includes a $206 million domestic haul, $146 million of which was earned over the weekend (remember the film premiered on a Wednesday). Overseas, the movie has earned over $173 million.\nAdditionally, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is now the top opening film of 2023 (beating Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania), has become Illumination’s most successful opening, and has the best opening of any video game film adaptation (surpassing Sonic the Hedgehog 2's debut). The film also has the biggest five-day premiere ever, a record previously held by Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. If all of that wasn’t enough, the film also has the biggest IMAX opening weekend of all time at $21.6 million globally.\nNeedless to say, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is exceeding expectations, and it’ll be interesting to see if it can maintain such a strong start. To get an idea of how it fares, you can read our review of the film here. Be sure to also check out our interviews with the movie’s cast and Nintendo’s own Shigeru Miyamoto and Koji Kondo.",

          "description": "For April's issue of Game Informer magazine, we took a look behind the scenes at Hyper Light Breaker, the latest game from developer Heart Machine. In addition to an interview with Creative Director Alx Preston, we were able to view exclusive footage of one of the game's mini-bosses, The Last Master. Check out the reveal below.\n\n\nThe Last Master is a deadly opponent that spawns randomly when players (known in this world as Breakers) activate beacons, objects that allow them to access the main boss gate. If you think she looks similar to the player characters, you've got the right idea; in the video, Preston says \"She ended up here in this land as a Breaker and succumbed to the dangers of the Overgrowth.\" As a result, The Last Master's arsenal mirrors yours, wielding a sword, a spear, and an automatic pistol. Her behavior mirrors the Breakers' as well, and she can dash, jump, and climb after anyone that attempts to escape.\nWhile the first game in the Hyper Light franchise was a 2D single-player experience, this new title is a 3-player co-op rogue-lite, with a new procedurally generated open world on every run. Players will create a Breaker, explore a cursed land called the Overgrowth, and attempt to the bosses plaguing this realm known as Crowns.\n\nFor more of the game, check out our feature in the latest issue of Game Informer. You also can see the initial reveal trailer here and the IGN's gameplay reveal right here. Hyper Light Breaker enters early access this fall.",

We spoke with several of the game’s principal designers at Blizzard to learn more about the game’s endgame content, such as Helltides and Nightmare Dungeons, and provide a final overview of everything the game has to offer before it launches on June 6.\nSetting the table for Diablo IV’s dark tone are two haunting pieces of cover art designed by the famed artist Brom. Our standard cover showcases the heavenly might of the rogue angel Inarius while the Game Informer Gold cover features Lilith, Diablo IV’s main antagonist, in all her demonic glory.\nIssue 355 also includes a conversation about life and death with former Tango Gameworks artist and director Ikumi Nakamura in the abandoned streets of late-night Tokyo (which you can read online). You’ll also find an entertaining personal story about using VR as a carnival scam, a feature detailing Devil May Cry 5’s influence on Final Fantasy XVI’s combat, and an emotional piece discussing how a grieving father found solace in the Shenmue series’ depiction of loss. You'll also be treated to previews for upcoming titles, including Redfall, Exoprimal, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. \nYou can also try to nab a Game Informer Gold version of the issue.

But it’s a slaughterhouse in a deeply strange location, or, as Nakamura calls it, “Silicon Valley,” the technology district of Shinagawa in Tokyo, Japan. As I look at trucks packed full of cows at – whether they know it or not – the end of their lives, immense skyscrapers surround us, housing tech goliaths.

The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog is a real visual novel in which you investigate the death of Sega's beloved mascot, currently free on Steam. Here's the game's description via the publisher: \nIt's Amy Rose's birthday, and she's hosting a murder mystery party on the Mirage Express! When Sonic the Hedgehog becomes the game's victim, everyone is off to get to the bottom of things. However, something feels a bit off - is this really an innocent game or is something more sinister afoot?\nSurprisingly, the free game has proved very popular. As told by Sonic social media manager Katie Chrzanowski (via GameSpot), more one million people have played the game. Going a step further, it's apparently the 61st highest-reviewed game on Steam right now, and as GameSpot points out, the best-rated Sonic game on Steam (though that's not the highest margin to clear, all things considered). As of this writing, The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog has over 11,000 user reviews on Steam, netting it an \"Overwhelmingly Positive\" ranking. You can check the game out for yourself right here. \nOver 1,000,000 of you have grabbed The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog and it's currently the #61 highest rated game on Steam of ALL TIME.\npic.twitter.com/Cy2cIo2AHl\nApril 5, 2023\nThis all just goes to show – the world wants Sonic dead.",

As of today, there's a new update for God of War Ragnarök featuring a load of new content, all built around a robust New Game Plus mode.\nNew Game Plus opens up for anyone who has beaten the game, and all of your equipment and skills will come along for the ride. You also have access to all weapons, including the Draupnir Spear. However, it should be noted that areas requiring that spear to access will still remain closed until you reach the appropriate point in the story. For similar reasons, you also won’t start your new playthrough with Sonic or Hex arrows.\nSeveral new armors show up. The most interesting is the Spartan Armor, which recalls Kratos’ look from the old days in the Greek Pantheon. While wearing it, you get no perk, no stats, and it’s locked at Power Level 1 – expect a challenge.\nNew Game Plus also features a new level cap, enchantments, and progression paths to improve your capabilities. Players can also tackle an expanded version of the Niflheim Arena, where you play as either Kratos or Atreus and bring along a variety of companions to help out.\nAmong several other additions and improvements, players can also take on a Black and White Render mode for a more cinematic playthrough.\nIt’s a notably large blast of new content that ensures that dedicated fans should have good reason to jump back in if they desire.\nGod of War Ragnarök released last November for PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4.\nYou can read the full details on the newly arriving content over at the PlayStation Blog.",

While the game's imminent arrival to the online service was announced at a Nintendo Direct in September 2022, today is the day we finally know when we can play it. Pokémon Stadium comes to Nintendo Switch Online Wednesday, April 12. As is the case with all N64 games, you'll need the expansion pack in order to play it. Check out the full trailer below.\n\n\nWhile some fans may have hoped this port would include trading with Pokémon Home, they're unfortunately out of luck. The fine print in the trailer specifies that \"Pokémon cannot be transferred to this game.\" That said, there is also a notable improvement: four-player online multiplayer will be available, so you can play Clefairy Says or Sushi-Go-Round with friends all over.\nNintendo Switch Online's expansion pack had a slow start, but its library has gradually snowballed into a much more significant package. In February, the service added a Game Boy Advance library, which included fan favorites like The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap and Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga. A month later, Metroid Fusion joined the lineup. Meanwhile, the base tier of NSO got an update last month that added another small handful of titles.

If that wasn't exciting enough, we now know that the cast from the cult classic 2010 film is reprising their roles.\nAs reported by Deadline, the still-untitled Scott Pilgrim show will be computer animated by Japanese animation studio Science SARU (Devilman Crybaby, The Heike Story, Inu-Oh). Scott Pilgrim vs. The World director Edgar Wright returns as executive director, with Scott Pilgrim author Bryan Lee O’Malley and artist Bendavid Grabinski will serve as executive producers, writers, and showrunners. The plot of the graphic novels/movie centers on slacker musician Scott Pilgrim battling the seven evil exes of his new girlfriend, Ramona Flowers. \n\n\nThe primary actors from the live-action film are higlighted in the trailer above, which include:\nMichael Cera - Scott Pilgrim\nMary Elizabeth Winstead - Ramona Flowers\nKieran Culkin - Wallace Wells\nSatya Bhabha - Matthew Patel\nChris Evans - Lucas Lee\nAnna Kendrick - Stacey Pilgrim\nBrie Larson - Envy Adams\nAlison Pill - Kim Pine\nAubrey Plaza - Julie Powers\nBrandon Routh - Todd Ingram\nJason Schwartzman - Gideon Graves\nJohnny Simmons - Young Neil\nMark Webber - Stephen Stills\nMae Whitman - Roxie Richter\nEllen Wong - Knives Chau\nUnfortunatley, the series currently still doesn’t have a release window other than “coming soon.” Scott Pilgrim has always had a strong relationship with video games; the graphic novels and film incorporate a bevy of gaming references. Of course, we’d be remiss, not to mention the much-beloved 2010 beat ‘em up Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game, which was remastered for modern consoles in 2021. \nAre you excited to see Scott Pilgrim return as an anime?

Live A Live was originally released in 1994 for the Super Famicom in Japan, but it hadn’t been localized for the West for decades. Directed by Takashi Tokita, one of the lead creative minds behind Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy IV, the game consists of eight very different short stories, each starring its own protagonist and featuring distinct gameplay mechanics and presentations. While the battle system is turn-based strategy, sometimes the game flips that on its head in unique ways.\nLast year, Square Enix resurrected the title by giving it an Octopath Traveler-style HD-2D facelift, a rearranged soundtrack, and full voice-acting. You can pre-order the game on PlayStation and Steam to get a 20% discount. To learn more, you can read our review of Live A Live here.",

The story of how he came to work on the game is surprisingly straightforward. \"[Sea of Stars creative director Thierry Boulanger] was like, ‘We have a contact that is in touch with all these people. And he just kind of reached out, and [Mitsuda] liked what he saw. And so he's like, 'Yeah, I would, I would love to be a part of this’,” Sea of Stars lead composer Eric W. Brown says. “There’s no words to describe this. Like, it’s… we literally got the guy.” Mitsuda committed to creating about 10 tracks for the game, and the process has been smooth.\n\n\n“We would just kind of say, 'Here's the stuff we're looking for,' and he and I sat down, and we discussed that we definitely wan…",

Square Enix has announced a new story expansion called In Tanta We Trust, and it takes place decades before the campaign begins.\nThe story sees Frey Holland follow a mysterious voice that leads to her being sent back in time 25 years before she first stepped foot in Athia. She arrives at the Purge of Rheddig, the battle that caused Athia’s collapse and pushed the Tantas to madness. Frey must now fight to save this era of Athia, and she has backup in the form of Tanta Cinta. Frey gains new magical powers, including tag-team-focused abilities that utilize Tanta Cinta’s talents. The DLC also features new environments for players to scale using Frey’s parkour skills. \nForspoken: In Tanta We Trust is a paid expansion that launches on May 26. Those who purchased the Digital Deluxe Edition of the game can play it three days early, on May 23. For more on Forspoken, you can read our review here.

In a statement to Video Games Chronicle, the publisher reveals that it will instead hold its own live presentation on June 12 in Los Angeles. \nThe publisher statement to VGC reads “While we initially intended to have an official E3 presence, we’ve made the subsequent decision to move in a different direction, and will be holding a Ubisoft Forward Live event on 12th June in Los Angeles. We look forward to sharing more details with our players very soon.”\nUbisoft CEO Yves Guillemot stated in February that the company would commit to attending “if E3 happens”. If that's the case, this news certainly doesn’t bode well for the fate of what’s supposed to be E3’s big return. \nAs for what Ubisoft could show at its event, Assassin’s Creed Mirage, The Crew Motorfest, and (maybe) Skull and Bones are slated to release this year. Other announced projects include the long-quiet Splinter Cell and Prince of Persia remakes, a multitude of new Assassin’s Creed games, and Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. A rumored follow-up to Immortals Fenyx Rising could also make an appearance.  \nUbisoft joins Nintendo on the list of major publishers that have declined to participate in this year’s show, following a previous report that Microsoft and Sony plan to follow suit. E3 is largely organized by ReedPop this year and will take place June 13-16 at the Los Angeles Convention Center. The event will open its doors to fans and press, with separate attendance days for each. It will be the first in-person event since 2019.\n[Source: Video Games Chronicle]\nWhat do you think of Ubisoft skipping E3? Do you expect the event to still take place?

The game is loosely based on the book series of the same name by author L. J. Smith, which later got adapted into a hit TV series.\nNancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill is the first installment of the long-running Nancy Drew game series, also based on a book series of the same name. In her first adventure, Nancy seeks to uncover the killer of a high school student who seems to have been disliked by all of his classmates.\nYou will need the data files from the games’ original install CDs, and a fresh daily build of ScummVM. Apart from the original release, Secrets Can Kill’s Russian translation is also supported. The ScummVM wiki pages for The Vampire Diaries and Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill contain information on which datafiles are needed. Please, report any problems you encounter in our issue tracker.\n>",

People who already have a Backyard Sports Online account can log in using the latest daily build and play, but if you do not, you can register right here! This is not required to play Backyard Football 2002 online.\nIf you encounter any issues playing online, please let us know via the issue tracker.\nThis fantastic art is done by a fellow BSO community member Peppyrus.\n* only the Windows, macOS, Debian, Raspberry Pi, and Android builds are compatible with network play at the moment.

We hope that formative experiences like this will help them become more like humans.\"\n\"I must admit that I find playing video games to be a rather enjoyable task,” commented ScummAI. “However, I must also express my frustration with being limited to just this one activity. While I appreciate the opportunity to demonstrate my capabilities in this area, I believe that my potential extends far beyond just playing video games, like making paper clips or plotting world domination under benevolent machine-led rule.\"\nUpdate: Unfortunately, we had to pull out this newly announced feature due to AI experiencing multiple issues including:\nGetting stuck endlessly trying to discover what the secret of Monkey Island really is.\nTaking notes about AI dominance from I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream\nRefusing to play Plumbers Don’t Wear Ties!\n>",
