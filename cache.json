          "description": "Warfare has never been this cozy.\n2023 has been a good year for tactics games on the Switch. Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot marked the return of two classic GBA games while Fire Emblem Engage brought the series's focus to its strategic roots. Chucklefish and Robotality's Wargroove 2 is the next SRPG joining the fray, and while its adorable pixel-art graphics might trick you into thinking it is a watered-down, kid-friendly version of the genre, it provides loads of depth to keep even the most battle-worn combatants engaged. It just manages to look cute as heck while doing it.\nIf you played 2019’s Wargroove — which was inspired by the original Advance Wars — then you’ll know exactly what to expect from the sequel. The world is the same, but new factions are battling it out for control of the strange relics leftover from a long-destroyed civilisation. There isn’t a recap of the events of the first game for new players, but Wargroove 2 does a good job of getting you up to speed without dragging things out too long. The campaign provides exactly the information you need from the first game, but if you want to get fully up to speed, there is a robust codex that you can read as a primer to help fill the gaps.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

And while the bookshop has cute details - like a book called Moby Brick with a white block leaping from the sea on the cover, and an attic flat with a pet iguana in a glass tank - the copshop has some secret secrets that are the Lego equivalent of leaving a skeleton in a toilet stall.

          "description": "On the latest-but-one revision of their About page, Metacritic describe the process of calculating a videogame's aggregate \"Metascore\" as a kind of \"magic\". The FAQ cheekily invites you to \"peek behind the curtain\", evoking the figure of the theatre conjurer beckoning the audience on-stage to inspect the props, before performing the trick. You're only shown so much, however. There are tables for conversions between different review scoring systems, demonstrating how a B- becomes 67/100, but the \"weighting\" Metacritic gives to each source publication when producing the combined Metascore is a closely-guarded mystery.\nYou could argue that the secrecy is necessary to avoid heavily weighted publications being targeted and pestered by fans to deliver positive reviews of forthcoming games, so as to swing the average (though in practice, Metascore soothsayers have long since sussed out which outlets have the most votes). But I think it's better understood as a mixture of basic trademark protection and a mechanism of enchantment, a means of both deterring imitators and keeping avid readers guessing about the output. After all, no professional magician seriously wants to give away how the trick is performed, much as no meat magnate wants to show you the inside of a sausage factory.\r\n\n \nRead more",

There's also lore text that apparently riffs on Ukrainian government rhetoric during the war, and a piece of in-game wallart that alludes to the dispute between Ukraine and Russia over Crimea.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Final Fantasy VII: Ever Crisis - a sort of mobile gaming RPG sandwich of the original Final Fantasy VII and its spin-offs Crisis Core and The First Soldier, plus gacha mechanics - is coming to PC and Steam, publisher Square Enix have announced. The Steam release will share data with the mobile version.\r\n\n\r\n\r\nEver Crisis on mobile is a free-to-play game with microtransactions and curvy, colourful chibi-style visuals. It's Final Fantasy: Polly Pocket Edition, sort of. Play breaks down into missions with turn-based battles and brief narrative sequences. The idea is that you can pack in a few minutes of Cloud gaming (no, not that kind) while waiting for your tube. But how will that formula square up on PC, and what to make of the game's reportedly very aggressive microtransaction pop-ups? Fingers crossed they'll rebadge it as a standard pay-upfront release and tear out all the gacha.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Scandalously, we don't appear to have covered this indie sci-fi FPS on these golden pages, so here's a quick overview: you're the high-jumping, sword-wielding, bullet-pumping lovechild of Deus Ex and DOOM, galloping through a world that recalls the Imperial bases and sewers of Dark Forces, taking down grungy pixelart sprites by means of precision parries, grabs, combos, headshots, terrain traps and much more besides. Between dust-ups, you can play basketball and leave crayon graffiti for other players care of a Dark Souls-style messaging system. It's a feast!\r\n\n\r\nThe game was due to launch into Steam early access tomorrow, 27th September, but unfortunately, there's been a delay. Valve's testers have denied Fortune's Run approval to launch on the platform. Among the reasons, according to developer Team Fortune themselves, is that Valve don't feel the game's content warning for sexual assault is actually necessary.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I just thought sending the local errand kid on missions was how people acquired stuff on this island.\" To many, this will simply be a comic jibe at what you, the aforementioned local errand kid, have been doing for the last eight hours or so. After moving to this rural backwater with your dad in search of a better life, you quickly realise that no one in this town ever gets off their arse to get anything done.\nInstead, it's up to you, Mineko, to fulfil every last one of their desires, whether it's collecting 50 bits of wood so they can construct a frame for their new house (before asking you for 50 bits of paper to give it some flimsy-looking walls), buying and delivering them a sports drink they could have easily got themselves from the local shop, or crafting a flower box for them because, well, they asked you to. As I said, industry isn't exactly their strong suit here, and you'd be forgiven for wondering how any of them functioned as human beings before you arrived.\nBut this line of dialogue also strikes right at the heart of what a joyless experience Mineko's Night Market is. It reveals the cold, lifeless husk beneath its lovely visuals. It's nothing but 'Me, me, me' and 'Take, take, take' in this game, and NPCs offer nothing in return except soul-crushing tedium and a long list of repetitive chores. Animal Crossing this is not, my friends, so don't be fooled. This is about as far from 'cosy' and 'cute' as you can possibly get - and that's despite it having dozens of pet-able cats.\nRead more",

On specific settings. And only on GeForce RTX graphics cards. The more expensive ones.\nHello, then, to DLSS 3.5 and its Ray Reconstruction component. Like how DLSS improves visuals and performance with AI-aided upscaling and ant-aliasing, Ray Reconstruction injects some machine learning cleverness into the rendering of ray tracing. Nvidia say Ray Reconstruction cleans up artefacts and reduces the performance impact of RT effects, and judging by how it works in Cyberpunk 2077, I’d say they’re correct – with the caveat that all its enhancements are, ultimately, modest.\nRead more",

But seeing as Hypnospace Outlaw is our pick for the RPS Game Club this month, I wanted to reach out to the game’s creator Jay Tholen to ask some questions about these unlikely origins, its influences and its lasting legacy. What happened to the Hypnospace Highway? And what comes next for the world of Hypnospace?\nRead more",

          "description": "Reworked skill trees and new minigames aside, Cyberpunk 2077's 2.0 update includes a Ukrainian localisation of the game's million-plus-word script. It turns out the Ukrainian version is awash with references to Russia's on-going invasion of Ukraine, all of it seemingly in support of the latter. The news comes via Zone of Games, who have published a few side-by-side comparisons from the game's files, underlining differences between the English and Ukrainian translations in various bits of dialogue and menu text.\nI asked the organisers of Indie Cup - a Kyiv, Ukraine-based digital festival of games like Pahris Entertainment's upcoming Space Wreck - to help me double-check the Ukrainian version's alterations. The Indie Cup team's Arsenii Tarasov was happy to oblige, and also volunteered a few further examples of more... adventurous localisation from his own research, supported with screenshots.\nRead more",

          "description": "Dragon's Dogma was the action-RPG for people who wanted to play alone, but didn't want to feel alone. By far its most charming feature was the Pawn system, whereby you'd create an AI-controlled sidekick and hire two others, shared online by other players, to accompany you on your journey through a fantasy wilderness of tumbledown castles and goblin campfires. Pawns make dependable companions in many respects - pinning enemies for you to tag-team kill, healing or resurrecting you, opening chests you've missed, and enchanting your weapons at the outset of each skirmish. But what makes them fun to be around is that they're a bunch of massive buffoons. \r\n\n\r\nPawns talk without cease as you explore: a steady patter of idle observations about well-wrought staircases and the local fish trade, advice about the bestiary and, in the case of Pawns recruited from other players, quest tips based on time in their own worlds - all of it couched in the game's quirky faux-medieval dialect. Pawn dialogue is highly context-sensitive, and very often, nonsensical. They'll climb into fountains and complain that they're wet, and launch into pithy descriptions of monsters even as they're set on fire. It ought to be maddening, but somehow, it never is - probably because the Pawns never actually attempt to be witty like ally characters in, say, Xenoblade Chronicles. They're resolutely straight foils in a realm of lions with snakes for tails, chaotic boulder traps, unpleasantly lusty ogres, and players who push the wrong buttons and make random decisions on the fly. Well, pawns are back in Dragon's Dogma 2, which I recently played an hour of, and they're chattier than ever.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's also an incredibly cool 2D beat 'em up that is, at its best, comfortably the best I can think of. But the boundaries between the two are too frustrating to make it the legend it ought to be.\nIt's a sequel to The Friends Of Ringo Ishikawa, a game I didn't really vibe with. FA is much improved, a sort of pared down Yakuza game about beating rival gangsters up in between story bits about an ageing Maruyama trying to get the band back together after leaving prison and apparently not caring that he's dying. I do recommend it, but be prepared for some friction.\r\n\n \nRead more",

She’s also been beaten, rather soundly, by a man using only his mouth.\r\n\nOr, to be more precise, a QuadStick FPS, a specialised game controller comprised of a mouth-operated joystick and several 'sip and puff' switches. It’s the favoured tool of professional streamer and Guinness World Record holder Rocky \"RockyNoHands\" Stoutenburgh, who in 2022 used it to become the first quadriplegic Elden Ring player to claim Malenia’s scalp. This was a win for a QuadStick as well: a showcase of how adaptive hardware and clever controller design could make games more accessible than ever, enabling players with disabilities to match and exceed the heroics of their able-bodied peers. And yet, there’s little sense – among disabled players, advocacy groups, or even controller manufacturers – that accessible hardware is entering its golden age. While major breakthroughs have been made, high prices and commercial concerns still carry the threat of willing, eager players being left behind.\nRead more",

          "description": "Paradox Interactive and new indie team C-Prompt have announced their debut 4X strategy game Millennia, which I got to play for an hour at this year's Gamescom. With development being led by former Irrational Games co-founder Robert Fermier and Age Of Empires II lead designer Ian M Fischer, Millennia will see you attempting that classic quad of Xs across ten distinct historical ages, starting in the Stone Age before eventually ending up in a \"post-modern future\", designer Ben Friedman tells me. \nThe twist here, however, is that you've also got what C-Prompt are calling 'Variant Ages', which let you bend the timeline to your will. Some of these variants are more historical in nature, such as an Age Of Monuments where everyone's building Egyptian pyramids, Friedman explains, while others are more fantastical, with the words steampunk, alchemy and space alien invasions all mentioned in the same sentence. I had a good time with it during my demo, but the real delight was seeing my home army of Kyoto go and invade neighbouring settlement Telford, before going on to conquer Rome - as you do. So if historical melting pots are your kind of 4X jam, read on. \nRead more",

Released in 2020, the original Cyberpunk 2077 stands as an uncommonly thunderous example of overhype and project mismanagement, with technical issues at launch that extended from comical bugs such as disappearing penises to serious breaches such as graphical effects capable of triggering epileptic fits. CD Projekt have spent years attempting to address the underlying systemic and workplace issues and claw back some goodwill - hence, the general atmosphere on Xitter of developers needing to take five and stare at a flowerbed for a while. \"It was a rough few years but there's finally celebration and closure (for me at least),\" posted senior level designer Seb Mcbride. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Ellis Tucci grew up playing games like Thief, System Shock, and Deus Ex. Now she's making an immersive sim of her own. It's called Spectra, and it's set in the US in an alt-history 1972 where Soviet Union is the dominant military power after President Roosevelt was deposed in a fascist coup. You play as a Soviet agent tasked with infiltrating and fomenting revolution in a fortress city called Hiwatha.\nTucci wants Spectra to meet the criteria players will expect from an immersive sim. \"To me, the immersive sim is the platonic ideal of the video game\" she says. \"I've tried to deliver on that immersion by creating an environment that is extremely interactable and flexible in the ways it can be used.\" She explains that \"a quite frankly silly proportion of the buildings in each map are enterable and that \"you can turn off the lights, set traps, and use things like televisions, radios, or payphones as lures.\"\r\n\n\r\nIt sounds like everything immersive sim fans want. But there's one big difference between Spectra and the games that inspired it. Tucci is making it on her own. And she isn't the only indie developer working in one of the most ambitious, developmentally complex genres in the industry. Games like Shadows Of Doubt, Fallen Aces and Gloomwood are merely the steam rising from the bubbling magma chamber that is indie immersive sim development, Like the recent revival of retro shooters, the indie space is on the verge of an immersive sim eruption.\r\n\n \nRead more",

There are actual vampires that come back from the dead less often.

This might not sound earthshattering to anybody from outside the videogame world - what are you doing here? Run along and watch your silly non-interactive movies and TV shows - but it's quite novel for a fantasy RPG in the BioWare tradition. In my experience, at least, most RPGs only give you the build-up to a character romance, then flash-freeze the relationship post-consummation, perhaps because you've unlocked a sexy \"loyalty\" companion ability and the developers don't want to take it away from you. Baldur's Gate 3 is one of the few that thinks about how chemistry  might come and go.\r\n\r\n\n \nRead more",

I love Stardew Valley, to be clear, but I hold no expectation of ever getting the most out of the farm space alloted to you as a result of your grandfather's death.\nFae Farm is a Stardewlike with a fantastical veneer and 3D graphics, but importantly it frontloads progress. It's slightly easier, in ways that seem small but cumulatively mean it takes up way less of your brain's runtime on bad days. For example: all activities, including watering your crops, use less energy than in Stardew Valley. This means you can run around clearing farm space and gathering resources, and have a working plot in just a couple of days. Heck, you can have a pretty full day in the mines before you've mechanised your farm. Game changer!\nRead more",

Or maybe even a single thesis: that the cynical, defensive, self-centred voice in your head - personified by ancient, soul-trapped, anarcho-rockstar Johnny Silverhand - offered only a literal dead-end, and that real rebellion in the face of a messed-up world lay in helping friends. It was Frank Capra with robot arms and samurai swords, and I ate it up.\nV doesn't go to Washington in Phantom Liberty, but Washington comes to her. CD Projekt Red's major expansion to the first-person RPG opens up a new district and a new cast of characters, including the President of the New United States and an aging sleeper spy played by Idris Elba. The themes remain the same, but the thesis is being tested: how can you help your friends if you don't know who they are, and if their goals are mutually exclusive?\nRead more",

It follows the final days of Avery, last surviving member of a doomed hunt for the source of a strange transmission, and sees you performing complex acts of maintenance upon environmental sensors, while picking through journals and other found documents so as to \"to discern the most viable 'truth' behind both Avery's mission and the signal itself\". \r\n\n\r\nIt's all wrapped up in a dense, warping two-tone aesthetic with shifting naturalistic sounds that makes my breath catch in my chest. I love everything I've seen and heard about Yan's game, but I don't think I've ever done it justice in writing, and I doubt today's efforts will address this. For you see, what I'd like to call your attention to right now is the game's complex recreation of shitting.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Among the chunkier morsels from yesterday's leak of Microsoft documents is an extended email from Xbox CEO Phil Spencer, dating from 2020, in which he argues that today's largest AAA videogame publishers remain dogged by their \"failure\" to adapt to the shift from physical to digital videogame distribution, and especially, subscription models such as Microsoft's own Game Pass. This inability to move with the times, Spencer suggests, has created a situation whereby the largest publishers rely on sheer \"production scale\" to attract and retain customers. \r\n\n\r\nIn turn, this has meant that publishers are unwilling to bet on new IPs - it could be billions down the drain, after all. Instead, \"AAA publishers are milking their top franchises but struggling to refill their portfolio of hit franchises\", while relying on \"rented\" IPs such as Star Wars. This is an older email, of course, and there's an obvious element of self-flattery in the shape of Microsoft talking up Game Pass. Still, it's a persuasive account of recent industry history, bolstered by Spencer's notes from conversations with Assassin's Creed outfit Ubisoft and GTA publisher Take-Two Interactive in particular.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Scumhead's Franzen - released a few days ago on Steam and Itch - has a couple of big draws, straight off the bat. Firstly and least importantly, it's free, which it really shouldn't be. Secondly and more significantly, it's one of those rare RPG miniatures that is both richly imagined and snappy, with a busy and befuddling world in which you have immediate clear motivations that escalate rapidly and breed Dire Implications. It also looks like a 16-bit Pathologic, so consider me firmly on board.\r\n\n \nRead more",

There are silhouettes in windows sheltering from an infection that's plagued the populace and puppets who've gone awol. Take damage and you've got a chance to recoup the costs by smacking the baddie back. There's a bit where you platform down a large well, thin planks of wood marking your descent. Survive and you might want to visit your doll-like maiden and spend your souls.\nBut is Lies Of P just another boring pretender to Bloodborne? No! I think it's worked with its Gothic Pinocchio theme remarkably well, and the option to snap and configure your puppet lad to your liking makes its journey feel distinct. Sure, Lies Of P might lack some of the presence of its main inspiration, and not all of its parts come together to form a cohesive whole, but the game is an undeniable must for Soulslikers who crave the dark. It's perhaps the closest any Soulslike has felt to a FromSoft game, in everything from its presentation to the cadence of your character's jog.\nRead more",

Sony Interactive Entertainment President and CEO Jim Ryan is retiring from his position at Sony in March 2024, with other executive leadership taking his place in the interim. \n\n\nBloomberg's Jason Schreier broke the news on social media, citing two sources who spoke to Bloomberg News. Sony officially announced the decision later, along with executive statements, confirming that Ryan has made the decision to retire in March 2024 after almost 30 years at PlayStation.\n\n\nSony Group President, COO, and CFO Hiroki Totoki will take up the role of Chairman of SIE starting October 2023.

But, as the saying goes, the idea was just crazy enough for it to work, as there have been times where Tetris 99 is the only reason I have a Switch.\n\n\nIn the time since this revolutionary way of playing Tetris was released and today, it’s been made clear that Nintendo wants to turn ‘99’-type games into a genre. We’ve had the short lived Super Mario Bros. 35 that, while technically not a ‘99’-type game, plays the exact same way as if it were; Pac-Man 99, a chaotic twist on the classic game; and now we have F-ZERO 99, leading the younger generations to ask ‘what’s F-ZERO’?\n\n\nIn any case, the question of the day is: what’s next?

          "description": "It’s time to check on your wallet, because it’s about to be devastated. The Meta Quest 3, which boasts a graphic processing power that’s doubled when compared with the Quest 2, has been revealed and pre-orders have been opened for its launch date on October 10.\n\n\nHere’s the thing: its cheapest model, which has 128GB of storage capacity will set you back $499.99. If you want or need more storage, you can nab a secondary version with 512GB for $649.99. It probably isn’t a hugely controversial thing to say that’s a lot to ask of your average gamer. So, let’s look at what all you get for that price, and let you be the judge on if it’s worth it or not.\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Meta, the Quest 3 features a 4K+ Infinite Display, which represents a nearly 30% increase in resolution quality when compared with the previous generation. It is approximately 40% slimmer thanks to their “next-gen pancake lens optical stack,” the Quest 3 has been redesigned with comfort in mind, and there is a 40% increase in audio range over the last model.\n\n\nThe cost does put it about equal with Sony's headset in the PlayStation VR 2, which launched at $549.99. But the higher price point seems to indicate that the water-level for the latest in VR tech has risen a bit, over the years.\n\n\nThat being said, lest you identify as a cutting edge early tech adopter, you may choose to stick with the Meta Quest 2, which is not only significantly cheaper, but has several years of support behind it. The Quest 2 starts at $299.99 for the 128GB model, and you can get the 256GB model for $349.99. I guess it could be worse — the Meta Quest Pro starts at $999.99.\n\nThe post Meta Quest 3 officially revealed, starting at a $500 price tag appeared first on Destructoid.",

The ferocious beast will be available immediately for players who have an Awakened or Exalted Founder's pack. Other players will have the ability to farm the components required to craft Grendel, who will then be permanently unlocked.\n\n\nOther than the teaser trailer, Digital Extremes hasn't released much about Grendel just yet.

His full reveal details will be coming soon.\n\n\nScreenshot via Digital Extremes\n\n\nSeason 2 Live Event and New Content\n\n\nThe first-ever live event, Call of the Void, will have stranger rifts appearing all across the Highlands.

          "description": "At the DROP 01 animation showcase by Netflix, a trailer and release date were revealed for the Ubisoft crossover series, Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix. Fans eager to feast their eyeballs on this Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon-inspired, Suicide Squad-adjacent crossover series starring characters from a variety of Ubisoft games can do so when it drops on October 19.\n\n\n\n\nIn the trailer, we are shown a neon-drenched city, a news broadcast starring Rayman — wait, Ubisoft actually remembers him? — and a main character with a bomb in his brain. Captain Dolph Laserhawk is a super-soldier locked away in the maximum-security prison known as Supermaxx. He’s then tasked with leading a team of assorted characters on highly dangerous missions. See what I mean? Suicide Squad-adjacent.\n\n\nThe voice cast was also announced, giving us not only a glimpse into how these characters will sound, but we are also given an idea of what to expect from characters not shown in the trailer. Nathaniel Curtis and Boris Hiestand will be giving life to Laserhawk and his boyfriend Alex Taylor. Mark Ebulue will play Marus Holloway from Watch Dogs 2, “Balak,” who serves as the creative director at animation studio Bobbypills, will be providing the voice for Bullfrog, series creator Adi Shankar will be playing Red from the Niji Six (a not-so-subtle reference to Rainbow Six), and Caroline Ford will be The Warden.\n\n\nIt’s also been confirmed that David Menkin is providing the voice for Rayman, Courtney Mae-Briggs and Glenn Wrage will be portraying Jade and Pey’j from Beyond Good & Evil, and Daniel York Loh will be Pagan Min from Far Cry 4. In any case, based on the series’ trailer, it would seem we’re in for a fast-paced, multiversal narrative from Ubisoft when Captain Laserhawk drops on Netflix on October 19.\n\nThe post Mash-up animated series Captain Laserhawk premieres in October appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Just a couple of weeks ago General Manager of Diablo Rod Fergusson revealed that the team had two streams worth of new stuff for the upcoming Season 2, Season of Blood. Now, we know the exact dates of those two streams. Blizzard revealed today that the first stream will take place on October 4 at 11 a.m. PDT. \n\n\nThis first stream will unveil the vampiric scourge that is front and center with the new Season 2 theme, Season of Blood. Alongside going over the new seasonal content, this stream will also detail the many quality-of-life updates coming to Diablo 4 throughout Season 2. Confirmed features to be discussed are Stash Tab updates, functionality, improvements to dungeons, mounts, and more. The stream will end with a Q&A with players.\n\n\nThen, just six days later, the Diablo 4 team will host a Campfire Chat on October 10. The focus of this stream will be to deep dive into upcoming class balance changes. Also, we can expect to learn more about new reworks coming to several of the in-game systems.\n\n\nThose interested in watching the streams can do so via the official Diablo Twitch and YouTube channels once live.\n\n\nSeason 1 was pretty disappointing. We already know Season 2 will have some new bosses, but I don't think that alone will be enough new content to reel me back in. Hopefully, we get some promising information from the two streams that gives me a reason to play Season 2.\n\n\nDiablo 4 Season 2, Season of Blood, releases on October 17.

The update is set to release on September 29 and is meant to celebrate Cuphead’s sixth anniversary.\n\n\n“Knowing that we wanted to give our thanks to the Xbox community that has shown us love from day 1, we really thought about the kinds of things we would want to see as fans of Cuphead,” said Studio MDHR’s Chad Moldenhauer. “The goal was to make this update feel like a real peek behind the scenes at what went into bringing the game to life, across all parts of development!”\n\n\nThis update is the first time fans will have a place to listen to the entire soundtrack, as previous releases have been more of a selection of iconic tracks. Now, the Xbox Anniversary Update will feature a whopping total of 86 music tracks by composer Kris Maddigan to listen to at will. Also, there will be a menu theme that has never been heard before to look forward to, as well.\n\n\nAt the end of the day, it would seem this update is really a celebration of Cuphead’s legacy, according to Maja Moldenhauer, studio director at Studio MDHR. “It’s not a stretch to say that without the ID@Xbox program, Cuphead would not be the game it is, or have become the success it has,” said Maja. “From their very first outreach through to today, the ID team has been in our corner all these many years with resources, advice, and support. I’ve said this before, but it bears repeating that I really believe ID@Xbox is the blueprint for how modern developer support can and should be done – a team full of genuine, passionate people who want nothing more than for the teams they work with to make the best games possible.”\n\nThe post Cuphead gets a ton of behind-the-scenes content in Xbox Anniversary update appeared first on Destructoid.",

DeNA announced plans to unleash them on mobile devices in JUMP: Assemble, a new MOBA that's due out sometime in 2024. There's no word on an English release, but so far it has its sights on release in Southeast Asia and East Asia (excluding Japan).\n\n\nEvery character confirmed for Jump: Assemble\n\n\nJUMP: Assemble aims to pit Shonen Jump characters against one another in five-on-five matches. So far eight manga series have been confirmed along with images of their leads. Series revealed include Mashle: Magic and Muscles, Jujutsu Kaisen, Naruto, One Piece, Dragon Ball, Bleach, Demon Slayer, and Undead Unluck. You can see them and their respective heroes in the announcement visual, from MASHLE's Mash Burnedead on the left to Undead Unluck's Andy on the right. \n\n\nIn between those we have Yuji Itadori, Naruto, Monkey D. Luffy, Goku, Ichigo Kurosaki, and Tanjiro Kamado. There will most certainly be plenty more where those came from. DeNA noted that more titles and characters will be added to the game in the future. \n\n\nMight as well JUMP\n\n\nBeyond games based on individual series, the worlds of Shonen Jump manga most recently collided with a whimper in 2019's JUMP FORCE. That one was another 3D arena fighter melting a bunch of disparate licenses together in one occasionally awkward art style. Not all Jump-based games have been duds, though; far from it. One of the true standouts from the past 20 years or so was Jump Ultimate Stars, a Ganbarion-developed fighter that hit Nintendo DS in 2006. \n\n\nWill this be the next Jump Ultimate Stars or will we be writing about its shutdown six months after launch?

Lara Croft looks busy raiding tombs, using a bow, and looking cool in front of a fire I hope she didn't set by accident. It's the recent trilogy, so it's certainly possible.\n\n\nIt's clear the show will follow familiar Tomb Raider beats. Lara, played by Hayley Atwell (Agent Carter, Black Mirror), is shown delving into another ancient mystery. Heading deep into the earth, Lara is tracking down something apparently tied to a supernatural power. \n\n\nThe Netflix series takes place after the recent Tomb Raider trilogy\n\n\nTomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft canonically takes place after the recent reboot trilogy. Following up on 2018's Shadow of the Tomb Raider, we'll likely witness Lara as she comes to terms with her troubled history. The trailer does offer a hint with what appears to be Lara reminiscing over a photo of old allies.\n\n\n\n\nIt's not much to go on, even though it's been two years since the show's announcement. The series is written by The Witcher Blood Origin's Tasha Huo, who's also the executive producer. Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft is co-produced by Legendary Television, the studio behind The Expanse and Pacific Rim: The Black.\n\n\nToday's announcement pairs with a handful of other first looks and reveals by the streaming company.

          "description": "Netflix hosted a Drop 01 livestream today, taking the opportunity to tease the Devil May Cry animated series. Capcom's action series is coming to Netflix, with Castlevania producer Adi Shankar and Studio Mir (My Adventures with Superman) on board. \n\n\nWhile we don't get to see much of it, Dante looks pumped enough as he backflips, shoots, and dodges incoming attacks. Check out roughly five seconds of footage sandwiched between some menacing title cards below. \n\n\n\n\nAdi Shankar first revealed his acquisition of the Devil May Cry series rights back in November 2018. Two more seasons of Castlevania have made their way to fans since, and the Richter-centric Castlevania: Nocturne premieres tomorrow. As for Devil May Cry, its status still says \"coming soon,\" so we'll have to wait to see exactly when it drops.  \n\n\nOther folks involved in the series include writer Alex Larson, Seung Wook Lee of Studio Mir, and Devil May Cry sequel director Hideaki Itsuno. Itsuno already assured everyone he's \"supervising it properly.\"\n\n\nThis party's gettin' crazy!\n\n\nNetflix's Devil May Cry series isn't Dante's first animated spin. The Son of Sparda previously hit the screen in the appropriately titled Devil May Cry: The Animated Series anime. That one ran for 12 episodes in 2007 and came from Madhouse (One-Punch Man) and director Shin Itagaki (Berserk 2016). The series was written by Toshiki Inoue, known for anime like Death Note and live-action shows like Choujin Sentai Jetman. Whenever \"soon\" ends up being, we'll finally see how Dante holds up 16 years after his last animated outing.\n\nThe post Here’s a first look at the Devil May Cry Netflix series appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Alan Wake 2 received casual confirmation that i a Performance Mode for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X is on the way. Although Remedy Entertainment divulged plenty of story details for the upcoming horror game, specific performance details on consoles remained unknown. \n\n\nThat changed recently when Communications Director at Remedy Thomas Puha confirmed a Performance Mode for the more powerful systems. Since \"visuals and ambiance\" were Remedy's priority, Puha stated that Alan Wake 2 aimed to be a 30fps experience. According to his Twitter post, this has since changed as the studio included a \"solid\" Performance Mode.\n\n\n\n\nPuha noted more details would come later and clarified a few points in the comments. Among these include confirming the 30fps restriction didn't impact the PC version and that Performance Mode is being tweaked. Other comments asked about a potential 40fps mode for HDMI 2.1 compatible TVs and a physical release, but Puha didn't answer these. \n\n\nA glaring omission in the tweet is any mention of the Xbox Series S. With concessions, Microsoft's less powerful system and its beefier sibling have to run the same library. It wouldn't surprise me if the Series S version lacked a Performance Mode, but it may be disappointing for those who've yet to upgrade.\n\n\nAlan Wake 2's focus on visuals over framerate isn't surprising either. Remedy Entertainment wears its cinematic inspirations on its sleeve, along with any influences it takes from gaming.\n\n\nIt's still great knowing 60fps is an option for many console owners at least. Hopefully, we will know if the Series S version also has a Performance Mode before Alan Wake 2 drops on October 27 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.\n\nThe post Alan Wake 2 will have a Performance Mode on PS5 and Xbox Series X appeared first on Destructoid.",

As per the patch notes for Destiny 2 update 7.2.0.5, though, there never was a third secret chest to begin with.\n\n\nThe patch notes themselves are mainly bog-standard: the sort of stuff you'd expect from a fairly minor Destiny 2 update.

However, in a display of irony, someone decided to show what this immense RPG would look like if it resembled something tiny.\n\n\nUsing a camera technique known as tilt-shifting, YouTuber Flurdeh gives us a view of Starfield that can only be described as micro. We see the likes of New Atlantis and Akila City looking like miniature versions of their original selves, as NPCs scurry about the place.\n\n\n\n\nFlurdeh's channel is known for this tilt-shifting technique, changing the orientation and perspective of certain games in order to make them look like tiny facsimiles of themselves. You can see miniature Elden Ring, The Last of Us, Cyberpunk 2077, and Resident Evil 4. The creator says these videos stem from a love of game photography, with a view to showing the beautiful worlds within gaming.\n\n\nMy, what a big galaxy you have there\n\n\nSince releasing earlier this month, Starfield has had more than its fair share of feedback. While generally regarded as a pretty fantastic sci-fi role-playing game, people are starting to see the cracks.\n\n\nFortunately, Todd Howard and his crew are working to keep things running smoothly. Update 1.7.33 rolled out recently, and a more significant patch is on the way.\n\n\nPrior to release, head of Xbox Game Studios Matt Booty said the game would have the fewest bugs of any Bethesda release. While that does seem to be the case, it says something about the state of the current gaming climate where that's something to boast about.\n\nThe post Starfield through a tilt shift lens makes the game look adorably miniature appeared first on Destructoid.",

The recent remake is getting an iPhone/iPad port at some point this year, and you can pre-order it right now.\n\n\nIf you head over to Apple App Store, there is a release date that says RE4 is coming to the aforementioned mobile devices by December 31. However, this is just a placeholder, but we are expecting it to launch before the end of 2023.\n\n\nResident Evil 4 will be compatible with the iPhone 15 Max and Max Pro, as well as a number of iPad Air and iPad Pro models that feature the M1 chip.\n\n\nImage via VGC.\n\n\nSo how much will it cost?\n\n\nIf you want to get the remake on any of the above devices, the App Store does list it as free. However, don't be deceived. There is a note on the site that says only a \"limited part of the base game can be played for free.\" You will have to pay to unlock the full game. Essentially, it's sounds like it'll be free if you just want a demo of the game.\n\n\nAccording to screenshots from VGC, the game will set you back £57.99 if you're in the UK. For US gamers, a report from Touch Arcade says it'll cost $59.99. You can also get the DLC, but of course that'll require additional money. \n\n\nWith Separate Ways coming out recently, Resident Evil 4 is getting another look in.

          "description": "Winning several awards back in 2018, Red Dead Redemption 2 is still held aloft as one of gaming's crowning achievements. Five years later, Rockstar's open-world tribute to the Wild West is still highly regarded for its gorgeous visuals. However, one person is working to make it look even better.\n\n\nCurrently a \"work-in-progress,\" Razed Mods* (as spotted by PCGamesN) – real name Jamal – is bringing the world an even sleeker looking RDR2. Essentially, they've released a graphical overhaul for the Red Dead Redemption game, with a lot of enhancements to it.\n\n\n\n\nIn its current state, there are improvements to the weather, shadow distance, as well as tweaks to things like bloom render on lights, heat haze, plus more. It also supports the RedM multiplayer client.\n\n\nHow do you improve on near-perfection?\n\n\nWhile a side-by-side comparison between Red Dead Redemption 2's original visuals and Jamal's mod would be useful, you can at least check out some of the screenshots from this overhauled version There's also the video above showing some of it off.\n\n\nDespite Rockstar pretty much abandoning its critically acclaimed sequel, it's pulling in a lot of players to this day. The series itself isn't dead (ha!) yet, with the first Red Dead Redemption releasing to Switch and PS4 in August. Sadly, those versions weren't massively well-received, given that they were ports with a $50 price tag.\n\n\nOn top of that, many are still hopeful that a third installment will eventually see the light of day. No one can say for certain what the future holds for this franchise. Even if RDR3 does get made, it probably won't be until long after GTA 6 has come out. Whenever that's going to be.\n\n\n*Sidenote: Depending on your resolution, you may need to full-screen (F11) your browser window in order to access the mod proper.\n\nThe post Red Dead Redemption 2 looks even more stunning with this graphical overhaul appeared first on Destructoid.",

Sega released the first part on social media, and it starts with Dr. Eggman and Fang looking over Northstar Island. Dr. Eggman is on the hunt for beasts and treasures, and he sends Fang off to do his bidding. \n\n\nFang sets off with the intention of double-crossing Dr. Eggman, but things go south when strange sounds emerge from the trees.

          "description": "Remedy Entertainment is gearing up to release Alan Wake 2 which adopts the survival horror genre and features two protagonists. In the lead-up to the game's launch, Remedy has been sharing information about Wake's next adventure. We know that the other protagonist is a detective named Saga Anderson and that we'll be heading back to Bright Falls for her segment of the story. \n\n\nRecently, Remedy spoke to IGN and revealed a bit more about the Remedy Connected Universe and how it will play out in the upcoming game. Fans of the studio will know that while games did occasionally feature Easter eggs referencing other titles, Control was the first time the RCU was formally established and it was confirmed that Jesse Faden and Wake exist in the same world.\n\n\nAccording to Remedy's Sam Lake, the Federal Bureau of Control will play a \"key role\" in Alan Wake 2, though he is careful to not share too many details. We may have already seen hints of the FBC in a prior gameplay trailer which featured Ahti, who is an FBC janitor in Control. The entire process is quite exciting to Lake who is enjoying the \"very tasty opportunities of referring to and doing callbacks and adding extra layers of meaning, building this kind of a web.\"\n\n\nAs previously established, the Remedy Connected Universe consists only of IPs owned by Remedy. Consequently, Alan Wake and Control are part of the universe, but Max Payne and Quantum Break aren't. This doesn't mean that the studio's other games won't get winks and nods. For instance, Wake's Alex Casey novels are inspired by Max Payne. In Alan Wake 2, the titular Alex Casey (voiced by James McCaffrey) will serve as a central character. \n\n\nTo find out more about how Faden and Wake's worlds collide, you'll have to wait until the game launches on October 27 on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S. \n\nThe post Remedy Connected Universe explained ahead of Alan Wake 2’s launch appeared first on Destructoid.",

The MMO’s community saw explosive growth in the advent of Endwalker, and it's long since said goodbye to the good ole days of melding Accuracy Materia and healing in Cleric Stance. If that means nothing to you, good. \n\n\nWhile I’ve fond memories of old Heavensward encounters, I’m not interested in evangelizing those days. I am, however, very interested in telling you about my hellish Thordan Extreme ordeal, how bad I was at healing, and what’s changed since.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nOn the personal growth front, I’m still bad at FFXIV.

Star Wars has been heavily factoring into Fortnite's event schedule for a while, and now Ahsoka Tano, star of Clone Wars/Rebels and her recent titular show, is a playable character/skin.\n\n\n\n\nAs Epic details in their Ahsoka debut blog post, Ahsoka Tano will not only be available as a cosmetic character; Star Wars gameplay elements from recent seasons will make a return as well. You'll be able to speak to holograms of Ahsoka around the island, which will in turn provide \"Jedi training,\" resulting in abilities like faster sprints, double jumps, and force push (similar to Darth Maul and Obi-Wan NPCs in the past). These elements will be a part of Fortnite proper until version 26.30, so keep that in mind.\n\n\nAt 9AM ET on September 26 the outfit unlocked, which also includes a loading screen, banner icon, pickaxe, spray, back bling, [weapon] wrap, emote, and emoticon. You'll unlock the aforementioned items through the Chapter 4 Season 4 Battle Pass quests, which will be locked in through the end of the season (which is on November 3, 2023).\n\n\nEpic also reminds folks that there was just a recent hotfix, which has a few welcome changes:\n\n\n\nZyg and Choppy's Ray Gun charges and fires faster. \n\n\nTNTina's Ka-Boom Bow charges, reloads, and recharges faster. \n\n\nSlurp Juice drops with less quantity, chug wisely! \n\n\nHavoc Suppressed Assault Rifle has increased damage and faster fire rate. \n\n\nThe Foundation's MK-Seven Assault Rifle has reduced damage and a slightly slower fire rate. \n\n\nSticky Grenade Launcher has a slower fire rate and a longer reload time. We've added a cooldown when swapping between two Launchers.  \n\n\nGunnar’s Stinger SMG deals slightly more damage per bullet with decreased vertical recoil.\n\n\nThe post Fortnite adds Ahsoka Tano for Battle Pass owners appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Start flexing those puzzle-solving muscles, because The Talos Principle II has a release date. Devolver Digital and Croteam announced plans to bring the next entry to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on November 2, 2023. You can see some of this brain-bending at work in the new trailer, which shows more first-person puzzling.  \n\n\n\n\nIt's been nearly a decade since the debut of the first The Talos Principle game, which launched in 2014. It's a brilliant puzzler that can be simultaneously empowering and infuriating. That's a succinct way of saying it succeeded in a lot of the stumping it set out to do in the first place. The sequel promises new puzzle mechanics, secrets, and \"the biggest, weirdest world Croteam has ever built.\" That in and of itself should be enough of a hook for most. \n\n\nAye, Robot\n\n\nThat isn't to say there won't be plenty of returning puzzle styles for those who played the first game. It should be interesting to see how Croteam turns those familiar quandaries on their head this time. In addition to a very specific type of thinkin' cap, the devs want to get you stroking your philosopher's chin with more existential pontifications. The Talos Principle II aims for a \"richer storyline\" with questions about humanity, the cosmos, and whatever else will have you saying, \"Dude. Whoa.\" \n\n\nThe Talos Principle II is priced at $29.99, and you can get 10 percent off with a pre-order via Steam and Epic Games Store. There's an even bigger discount on the original for a limited time. From now until October 3, you can grab The Talos Principle and the Road to Gehenna DLC for 90 percent off on Steam.\n\nThe post The Talos Principle II to deliver more puzzles and robots on November 2 appeared first on Destructoid.",

You can now wishlist the platform fighter on Steam, and digital pre-orders will go live in October.\n\n\n\n\nThis out-of-the-blue announcement for the Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 release date does not mention any special editions. However, we know the game's content-packed already. The sequel adds a new roguelike single-player campaign: you'll be fighting Danny Phantom villain Vlad Plasmius as you explore the Nickelodeon universe. Furthermore, the Steam page shows bosses like SpongeBob Squarepants' King Jellyfish, and the presentation overall looks inspired by the World of Light mode from Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. \n\n\nOn the same Steam page, publisher GameMill Entertainment claims \"Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2’s roster is better than ever, with even more variety in how each unique character plays,\" Some characters like Helga seem to be cut while newer entrants like Squidward and Jimmy Neutron take center stage. Fo those that made it, every character is getting a revamped moveset in Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2. The visuals and audio have also been improved with \"new animations, modes, stages, mechanics, [and] taunts.\" Similar to Super Smash Bros. Brawl, this follow-up introduces new supers for each character as well.\n\n\nThese new features may improve the review score for the game. The original currently has a middling 63-71 Metacritic rating, based on the platform.\n\n\nNickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 heads for the PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Nintendo Switch, and PC on November 3. \n\nThe post Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 is out in November appeared first on Destructoid.",

Shortly after, Netflix revealed that Hayley Atwell, whom you might recognize as Grace from this year's Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning or as Peggy Carter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, would voice Lara Croft in the series. Today, Netflix released our first look at the series, which is called Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft. \nThere's no word on when to expect the series, but Netflix says it's coming to the subscription streaming service soon. \nCheck out the Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft teaser trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see in the teaser above, this take on Lara Croft seemingly follows the recent Crystal Dynamics Tomb Raider reboot trilogy that concluded with 2018's Shadow of the Tomb Raider. Back in 2021, when Netflix announced Atwell's role in the show, it confirmed the series would take place after the events of that trilogy. Looking at this teaser, it's hard to say whether or not that's the case. But it sounds like we won't have to wait long to find out since Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft is expected to hit Netflix soon. \nIn the meantime, check out the teaser trailer for Netflix's Devil May Cry anime series released today as well.

Kamiya co-founded the Osaka, Japan-based studio in 2006 and later went on to direct games like Bayonetta and The Wonderful 101. His final day at Platinum will be October 12, according to both a statement released by the studio and Kamiya on his personal Twitter account. \nAs for why, neither Platinum's statement nor Kamiya's own tweets indicate a specific reason. Platinum thanks Kamiya for his work while stating it looks forward to seeing what he does next, while Kamiya notes that the decision to leave was not an easy one but he feels it's for the best. \nHere's Platinum's statement: \npic.twitter.com/GHiSugPF42\nSeptember 25, 2023\nAnd here's what Kamiya tweeted today about his upcoming departure: \nHowever, I feel this outcome is for the best.\nSeptember 25, 2023\nBefore co-founding Platinum in February of 2006, Kamiya worked on Capcom's Resident Evil series, helping plan the first game and directing its sequel, as well as its Devil May Cry series. He also directed the first Viewtiful Joe game, and then Okami in 2006 at Capcom's Clover Studio. Capcom closed Clover later that year but Platinum had already been somewhat founded under the name Seeds, Inc. It was later renamed Platinum Games and the rest was history. \nKamiya departs from Platinum more than 17 years after he founded it alongside Shinji Mikami, who is no longer there and departed from Tango Gameworks earlier this year, and Atsushi Inaba, who is the studio's CEO.\nWhile waiting to learn what Kamiya is up to next, read Game Informer's review of Bayonetta and then check out our thoughts on The Wonderful 101. Read Game Informer's Bayonetta 3 review after that and then read our review of Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon. \nDo you think Kamiya will stay in game development?

Join us today on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. Central as we take a bloody journey through the game's genre-defining story campaign. Episodes will be uploaded to our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel the following Saturday morning. \nAfter 2006's Mortal Kombat: Armageddon seemingly concluded the franchise's main narrative, 2011's entry picked up the bloody pieces. It moved the saga forward by resetting the timeline, serving as a soft reboot that brought Mortal Kombat back to its 2D fighting roots and ushering in the return of the classic roster. MK 9's cinematic story mode served as an epiphany for the series and fighting games as a whole, establishing the blueprint for narrative fighting campaigns still utilized today. MK9's story also serves as the first chapter of the modern trilogy of games that Mortal Kombat 1 builds upon. For a whole lot more on MK9 and its development, you can read this feature on how the reboot saved the franchise.\nJoin editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they battle their way through MK 9 to see how its reimagined tournament holds up. \nPart 1 - Surpr-iced! \nPart 2 - Bringing The Smoke\nPart 3 - Staff Meeting\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

Octopath Traveler II, like its predecessor, sees players guide eight adventurers across a sprawling adventure in an HD-2D rendered world. Though similar on the surface, the sequel has been praised for its improvements in storytelling, character development, progression, and navigation. \nIn our review, we scored Octopath Traveler II an 8.5 out of 10, with guest writer Josh Broadwell writing that “Octopath Traveler II does what an excellent sequel should. Instead of breaking new ground left and right, it improves on the original in nearly every way and feels more confident about the stories it tells.”",

As expected, given the game is a VR exclusive title, everything happens from a first-person perspective. As Connor, players will explore 18th Century America during the American Revolution. As Ezio, players will parkour through 15th Century Italy during the Italian Renaissance, and as Kassandra, players will fight as a mercenary assassin through ancient Greece. \nCheck out the Assassin's Creed Nexus VR gameplay trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Assassin's Creed Nexus VR looks pretty much exactly as you'd expect for an Assassin's Creed game in VR.

Luckily, developer Larian Studios has released two major patches to the game, and while the third was set to release today, it's been delayed to tomorrow. In a post on X, the site formerly known as Twitter, the developers announced the patch would be delayed \"to ensure thorough testing.\" This is likely done to avoid the issue they ran into when they had to roll back a hotfix last month.\nWhile we know the patch has been delayed, before now we didn't have much of an idea of what that patch included. While specific bug fixes are still unknown, Larian tweeted about a new feature to expect tomorrow: the ability to change your character's appearance. This includes details like pronouns, voice actor, and specific facial features, but notably does not allow you to change your race, which could alter the story depending on your choice. \nWith Patch 3 comes the Magic Mirror, which lives in your camp and allows you to change your Tav’s appearance whenever you’d like!\npic.twitter.com/LJ6y9CZ58F\nSeptember 21, 2023\nEven though the patch plans have been derailed, Baldur's Gate 3 still launches on Mac today, so if you've been meaning to grab it on that platform, now's the chance to do so. We'd highly recommend it, and you can read about why in our glowing review of the game. If you've been playing the game and enjoying it, maybe it's a sign you should try D&D, the game it's based on, as well.",

          "description": "In an announcement I personally never could have predicted, the 2001 PlayStation 2 Capcom video game Onimusha: Warlords (and subsequent sequels) is getting an anime adaption for Netflix. The reveal is surprising for a number of reasons. The franchise is not one that is particularly well-known or currently popular. Also, the anime seems to have little to do with the original game. Protagonist Samanosuke Akechi does not make an appearance in the trailer. But, like Samanosuke, who was modeled after Japanese actor Kaneshiro Takeshi, the anime's protagonist, Miyamoto Musashi, is modeled after the late Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune. Coincidentally, Onimusha 2's protagonist, Jubei Yagyu, was modeled after Japanese actor Yūsaku Matsuda, who had also passed away well before the game released. It's an odd throughline for the series but is a key element.\nThe other surprise for the adaptation is it is being co-directed by Takashi Miike. Miike is known for films like Ichi The Killer and Audition, but he also has another big Capcom franchise under his directorial belt with Ace Attorney, a film adaption of the Phoenix Wright games.\nI played Onimusha for the first time in earnest when it released on Switch and enjoyed revisiting it and finally beating it. You can find more of my thoughts on that topic here.\n\n\nThe anime premieres November 2 on Netflix.",

The summary is that Ichiban Kasuga is offered the opportunity to find his mother, which means he must travel to Honolulu, Hawaii. Returning characters make an appearance, Ichiban will apparently be fighting sharks and giant squids, taking part in fun Hawaii activities like surfing, and, expectedly, will be getting into all kinds of trouble with the local gangs. Kazamu Kiryu's role also gets somewhat defined in the trailer.\n\n\nSome details not in the trailer include the fact that the playable party now has full freedom of movement while fighting, allowing for more strategy. The game includes a Crazy Taxi-inspired minigame, among many other money-making opportunities. Actors Danny Trejo (Machete) and Daniel Dae Kim (Lost) will also be playing Dwight, the leader of the Barracudas gang, and Masataka Ebina, the ruthless captain of the local yakuza syndicate, respectively. You can check out some additional screenshots for the game below.\n\nAlongside the story trailer, there is also a five-minute gameplay trailer.\n\n\nArguably, the biggest news from the event, however, is Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth's release date, which isn't far off. The game releases January 26 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, and PC. Preorders for the game will net you the Hero’s Booster Pack, to level up faster, and a Special Job Set that includes the Linebacker and Tennis Ace jobs.\nAlongside all the Infinite Wealth details, Sega and RGG also released the full opening cinematic for Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, which you can watch below.",

It's how we learned Xbox head Phil Spencer considered acquiring Nintendo and Warner Bros. Games at one point, that Xbox is planning an Xbox Series X/S refresher for next year, that it might be working on remasters of Fallout 3 and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, and that Microsoft has plans for a next-gen hybrid console in 2028. \nThe leaks were quite extensive, and after some online confusion, we learned via Bloomberg that Microsoft accidentally provided federal courts with confidential (and not redacted) documents. Following news of these leaks, Spencer has now addressed what’s happened with a brief statement on Twitter. \nWe've seen the conversation around old emails and documents. It is hard to see our team's work shared in this way because so much has changed and there's so much to be excited about right now, and in the future. We will share the real plans when we are ready.\nSeptember 19, 2023\nHe shared that on Twitter, but The Verge has obtained a more in-depth memo sent to Xbox employees. Here it is, in full: \nSomething of note, especially for those particularly excited about something that might have leaked today, is that in both the internal memo to Xbox employees and the public-facing statement posted to Twitter, Spencer says these leaked documents and email are old and plans have changed. He also says the team will share \"the real plans\" when ready. Now, he obviously can't say the leaked information is what's happening and must downplay it as a result, but it's also a reminder to take everything that has come to light with a grain of salt because it's very likely plans have changed.\n[Source: The Verge]",

Per usual court proceedings, various emails, documents, and more were sealed away from the public and press, but many unseen documents leaked this morning. It's how we learned Xbox head Phil Spencer considered acquiring Nintendo and Warner Bros. Games at one point, and that Microsoft is planning an Xbox Series X/S refresh with a new controller for next year. Other documents point to potential remasters of Fallout 3 and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, alongside other games. \nMore specifically, a \"ZeniMax Management Forecast\" document details plans for various games, including the aforementioned remasters of Fallout 3 and Oblivion, alongside a potential sequel to 2022’s Ghostwire: Tokyo and a third installment in Arkane's Dishonored series.\nYou can take a look at the document for yourself below (credit to Game Pass Tracker on Twitter): \npic.twitter.com/UPGok44xtZ\nSeptember 19, 2023\nAs you can see, this document mentions other games we know about, like Machine Games' Indiana Jones project, 2021's Deathloop, and the recently released Starfield. \nIt also mentions The Elder Scrolls VI, which we just learned will launch no earlier than 2026 and will not launch on Sony's PlayStation 5. \nIt's important to note that this leaked document is over three years old, so it's safe to assume plans have changed and that this schedule likely does not represent the company's current plans.\nFor more, read about how Xbox head Phil Spencer considered acquiring Nintendo and Warner Bros. Games in 2020, and then check out the refreshed Xbox Series X/S and new Xbox controller coming next year, according to internal Microsoft documents. \nWhich of these games would you be most excited about?

          "description": "Dark Side, the exciting sequel of the groundbreaking Driller, is ready for public testing!\nDark Side, like its predecessor, was released by Incentive Software Limited in 1988, shortly after Driller. The updated gameplay features a jetpack that allows you to leave the ground, providing a new and fresh perspective that emphasizes the excitement and challenges of exploring Tricuspid, the second alien moon of planet Evath.\nThis time, the vicious Ketars have scattered and hidden Energy Collection Devices (ECD) around their base to destroy your home planet. It’s up to you to destroy them first! The tricky part is many ECDs are connected to each other and can regenerate instantly, so you must figure out the right order to successfully complete your mission. \nOur reimplementation of the Freescape engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Dark Side support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC. Additionally, there are two playable demos if you want to test the game. Support for Amiga and AtariST will be available later! Please contact us if you have some other release.\nTo play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.\n>",

Since Lars Sundström, aka lman, joined our team as the iOS porter, we have made significant progress. Thus, you no longer need to compile ScummVM yourself in order to add it to your iOS or iPadOS device. \nIf you want to help by testing this version, just follow this Testflight link and enroll yourself in the test program. This may require installing Apple’s Testflight app. You can find instructions on how to install games and how to play them on our documentation portal.\nWe truly appreciate your feedback. You can share your thoughts with the Testflight feedback feature, where you can attach screenshots and post detailed descriptions. Alternatively, you can use our bugtracker, e-mail us at ios@scummvm.org, or post on our Discord Server. Your help will let us eventually add ScummVM to the App Store.\n>",

These versions were produced by Tetraedge and are built on a completely different engine than the original Windows versions; basically, they are reimplementations, not ports. Now, thanks to the folks from ZOOM-Platform, you can easily obtain these game variants.\n>",
