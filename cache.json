Our latest interest is the mysterious language hidden within the tiny snippets of game that we've seen in the Tears of the Kingdom trailers and teasers, which is carved into stone tablets and walls, spiralling up from Ganon's trapped corpse, and even found on Link's new melty Master Sword.\nA new language wouldn't be out of the question, either. Breath of the Wild introduced the Sheikah Script, which was largely used to write things like \"Dungeon\" inside a dungeon (a very literal people, those Sheikah) — and, if our various Zonai theories are correct, this hieroglyphic script could be the language of the Zonai.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

But there were some interesting gems hidden in all the biz-speak, so let's take a look!\nPennefather says that 2022 was a \"blockbuster year\" for Nintendo, which is no surprise given the launch of games like Splatoon 3, Kirby and the Forgotten Land, and not one, but two Pokémon games. In Canada, that translated to the Nintendo Switch being \"the number one selling system in Canada for the fifth consecutive year,\" Pennefather states, citing that a large part of that is the appeal to a \"broad and massive audience\", comprising around 53% of Canadians, roughly half of which are female.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

A close second is when the ranked format changes, specifically the official double battle format. Trainers have been experimenting with Pokémon Scarlet and Violet's ranked double battles since December 2022, shaping a meta from online play tournaments around the globe. But as of 1st February, the ranked rule set has changed for the first time this generation.\nAs exciting as new ‘mons, strategies, mechanics, and – this time around – no Incineroar are, Series 2 brings even more changes to the fold. So, what’s different? In short, the new series lengthens the list of legal Pokémon to include powerful Paradox Pokémon that will drastically change the meta with their abilities, but not the Legendaries Koraidon, Moraidon, the four Treasures of Ruin, and assorted Pokémon from other regions.

It definitely comes from a place of accessibility, where an onslaught of timed bars and coloured symbols can be intimidating for casual players. But what about the rest of us who want to be pummelled to death in time with a catchy beat?\nGood news! TinyBuild's new action-adventure game Rhythm Sprout: Sick Beats & Bad Sweets does not hold back. I'm not even halfway through the game and I’ve had my butt completely kicked by its barrage of oncoming beats, and all in perfect time to its soda-pop EDM.\nRead more",

          "description": "Can I tell you a secret? I'm terrible at Battle Brothers. I'm still terrible at Battle Brothers, even after playing it on and off for a few years. It's a bit like Blood Bowl, oddly, in that it's all about mitigating risks. And like Blood Bowl, despite having a decent head for tactics and planning on the fly, I am hopeless at sticking to them when I see a new idea, thus: terrible. At it.\nBut since an update last March looks likely to be its last big one, it's about time to get over myself and gave it a proper look as a complete package. It's long overdue, in fact. Although I still struggle to fully enjoy it, Battle Brothers is an unusually good tactical game, and the one to beat for the burgeoning subgenre of mercenary management sims. That's partly because it sticks so resolutely to its guns. Where Bannerlord faltered by throwing extraneous stuff unrelated to the core combat that should have defined it, and other open world games typically take a varied but shallow \"do and be everything\" approach, Battle Brothers resists dilution of that core concept.\nRead more",

If KeokeN's Deliver Us games are anything to go by, though, life in outer space isn't all that peachy either. In Deliver Us The Moon, you may remember the scientists in charge of the moon's Earth-saving energy beam tech ended up having a bit of a Rapture moment, sabotaging all their good work (and the future of Earth in the process) and buggering off to goodness knows where to start life afresh in their newly birthed utopia. In its sequel, Deliver Us Mars, you find out those rogue astronauts didn't actually go that far at all. Yep, they hopped on over to the red planet and set up shop there, and when a strange transmission comes through revealing their location, it serves as the catalyst to send yet another crew into space to go and investigate. \r\n\nThis time, though, you're right at the heart of its central conflict. By casting players as Kathy, the daughter of one of those rogue astronauts, Deliver Us Mars tells a much more fraught and personal tale of what kind of future humanity should be pursuing: should we, in fact, be turning our efforts toward a life in outer space, or should we be doing everything in our power to try and save the dire, pretty much almost dead husk of a planet we call home? \nRead more",

In addition to a huge client update for the handheld PC, Valve pushed out a Proton Experimental update to fix a crashing problem with games that use the Ubisoft Connect launcher on Steam. \nUbi’s launcher had received an update of its own, sadly one that interfered with the ability of Proton – the layer of software that helps made-for-Windows games run on the Linux-based SteamOS – to keep it compatible with the Deck. Indeed, just like the 2K Launcher last year, with the added irony that the affected games (which include The Division 2, Watch Dogs Legion and Ghost Recon Breakpoint) only arrived on Steam in the past few weeks. \nRead more",

          "description": "Fans have been clamouring for a sequel to Titanfall 2 since its release in 2016, but it looks like we might need to put those hopes on hold for a little longer. According to a report from Bloomberg, EA have cancelled an unannounced project codenamed Titanfall Legends, a single-player mash-up between Titanfall and Apex Legends - Respawn’s battle royale, set in the same universe. Around 50 devs were working on the game before its cancellation earlier this week. EA are reportedly trying to find other positions for the devs, but those that aren't rehired are being laid off with severance. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Sometimes I want to describe games in the most high-brow way possible. I might smugly write something like “it elevates the genre” while sipping wine and eating cheese, musing on how a game pushes the media forward as an art form. Other times I just want to write that a game is really bloody good, actually, and I like it lots.\nHi-Fi Rush falls into the latter category. Developer Tango Gameworks shadow-dropped the rhythm-action game out of nowhere shortly after an Xbox presentation, jettisoning The Evil Within’s murky mental hospitals and Ghostwire: Tokyo's supernatural shinanigans for something markedly different: bright pulsating neon colours and a gang of loveable anime ruffians, where every whack and dodge is underscored by a beat. \nHi-Fi Rush is an action-adventure game with a mechanical core fuelled by musical beats. Protagonist Chai has undergone a risky medical procedure and emerged from the other side with a robot arm and an iPod accidentally implanted in his chest meaning his every waking moment is punctuated by a catchy beat. We too see these rhythmic motions, as Hi-Fi Rush's soda pop-infused world moves to this steady pulse - platforms move in time with the music, lights flash in pleasing rhythmic patterns, and enemies attack to the beat of the drum. \nRead more",

It’s so significant that, when ranking the significance of other similar things, we all forget it until someone goes “wait wot about Minecraft” and then everyone unleashes a collective “oooo yeahhh”, guaranteeing it the top spot. To echo AliceB’s sentiments upon revisiting Portal, it’s fuckin’ Minecraft.\nIn fact, I think I could take her Portal revisited intro, replace every instance of “Portal” with “Minecraft”, and call it a day. It’s Minecraft! Of course it was game of the year. It was arguably the game of the decade, an absolute all timer. I won’t spend many words explaining why it is good, because those words would be redundant fodder, like the bloke fighting a soaring dragon by poking the ground under his feet with a sword. I’ll give it a fair go so that Alice can’t say I didn’t try, and swiftly move on to reading all of your (hopefully) lovely comments about why you also like Minecraft.

I say \"i think\" because it's been long enough that I can't remember if I told the game to generate it as five or six thousand. But it's a lot of thousand.\nI really like jigsaws (I am in the middle of doing a real life one that is a big copy of the London Underground map) but, even though I have one of those special mats to do puzzles on so you can fold them away, they're quite inconvenient. At the same time, though, there are very few digi-jigsaws that capture the kind of tactile experience of sifting and sorting through pieces. Jigsaw Puzzle Dreams really does, though.\nRead more",

But Yaza Games have taken a bit of a different direction with Inkulinati's vibe by adding a whole heap of cheeky humour. You wouldn't think it would suit the stuffy nature of religious manuscripts, but actually those monks were pretty cheeky blokes, and Inkulinati's humour is done in a way that stays completely loyal to the source material, fart jokes and all.\nRead more",

When it emerged on the Epic Game Store in the autumn of 2021, you could see the conflict roiling in its belly - between the linear science fiction short story on the surface, and the freeroaming “Metroid snowboarding game” fighting to get out from underneath it.\n“Once the story finished, I hoped an endgame would open up and allow me to play freely in its world,” I wrote in our Jett review. “That I’d have more opportunities to watch great Ghoke, the red sun, rise in real time, and to ponder the Far Shore’s fascinating mysteries at length. Instead, I could only replay previous chapters. If only Jett had embraced a rhythm as organic as its inspired ecosystem.”\r\n\n\r\nWhen the Jett team read that review, they didn’t disagree. “You put your finger on it more accurately than anybody else, which was, ‘It really feels like this is building up to some sort of systemic-focused, open world endgame,’” says Superbrothers founder Craig Adams. “And internally we were like, ‘Yeah, it is.’” What they knew, and I didn’t, was that The Far Shore was just the first part of a two-campaign story. That journey has now been completed with the launch of Given Time, a bonus 12-hour adventure that coincides with Jett’s long-awaited Steam release. \r\n\n \nRead more",

In a series of Twitter posts, Activision announced a new, free-to-play “small map” called Ashika Island. Warzone’s new map will feature a brand new mode DMZ, alongside the returning mode Resurgence - a slimmer BR that cuts the lobby size down from 150 to 50 players, and enables respawns. Ashika Island and the new modes will launch alongside Season 02 on February 15th.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "I've come to regard the four main games in the Life Is Strange franchise as kind of like the siblings in a big family. There's the eldest, who will always be heaped with praise because no matter what the others achieve, she did it all first. Her twin is always keen to remind you that even though she's the younger and perhaps not quite as accomplished half of the duo, she's more charismatic and less coy about who she is and what she wants. Then there's the youngest, who's extremely likeable, in large part because she's learned what behaviours to avoid just by watching the others make mistakes; even if she's modelled herself on the eldest a bit too closely in her quest for approval, and so hasn't really forged her own identity.\nThen there's Life Is Strange 2: the awkward middle child. Still very recognisably a member of the family, but the one that stands out in all the photos because he's just a bit gawky. He's experimented a lot with his storytelling and plotline in an attempt to make himself stand out, and it's only sort-of worked. His romantic subplots are underdeveloped, his villains are one-dimensional, and his attempt at tackling a Very Serious Issue has grown in all crooked.\nRead more",

It's the capper on what has been a turbulent month for the company. Three weeks ago Ubisoft announced they were cancelling three unannounced games amid “worsening macroeconomic conditions.” In a letter to employees, CEO Yves Guillemot said that “the ball is in your court” in regard to hitting deadlines and overturning Ubisoft’s sticky financial situation. French union Solidaires Informatique said that Guillemot’s \"words mean something: overtime, managerial pressure, burnout, etc,\" and called on Ubisoft Paris employees to strike for better pay and working hours.

          "description": "The road to launch has been a uniquely turbulent one for The Settlers: New Allies. After an eight-year absence, the next entry in Ubisoft’s beloved city-building series was finally revealed in 2018, only to be delayed indefinitely two years later. The game then reemerged in a fresh new form in 2022, but a less than favourable reception from long-term fans to its closed beta saw the game delayed indefinitely once again.\r\n\n\r\n12 months later, The Settlers: New Allies is all the better for it. An extended delay is never an easy decision to make, yet the team at Ubisoft Düsseldorf (formerly Blue Byte) has seen this additional development time as an opportunity to reach out to those most familiar with the series. “We learned [more] than just what was needed for the game,” creative director Christian Hagerdorn tells me during a recent preview event. “One of our biggest focuses was to be absolutely transparent with the players. Not just on where we were standing, but where we were going. We've been collecting the feedback as we were developing”.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's all very well being able to zoom around doing magic parkour everywhere, but there isn't much to do or many places to go. Not a single talking unicorn to be seen.\nForspoken is somehow both full and devoid of content. There is a huge open world, but it is mostly empty. There is an epic story of magic, other universes, and saving the world, but it only takes up a couple of days. I actually enjoyed a lot of Forspoken, but it gets more fun the more you play, and then it's over; I didn't pre-order this game for sixty odd quid, and if I had I'd be disappointed. Even the much-Tweeted about annoying dialogue doesn't happen much, and isn't contextually annoying. Forspoken is annoying, though, just not in the ways you might expect if all you've seen is people discussing out-of-context clips from cutscenes.\nRead more",

          "description": "Some developers spend their careers inching towards their dream job, leapfrogging between roles in a grand strategy game of their own making. Others, like Randy Smith, simply show up on their first day and find they’re exactly where they’re meant to be.\r\n\n\r\n“The approach that Looking Glass had to creating games was pretty unique,” he says now. “Even to this day, there are few studios who have that same ideology and mindfulness in how videogames are made.”\r\n\n\nThief: The Dark Project had a great director, in the form of Greg LoPiccolo, who later became a pioneer in the world of music games with Guitar Hero and Rock Band. And before him, Ken Levine had laid down the cobbles of Thief’s setting, defining its noir-ish tone before heading off to work on System Shock 2. Yet Looking Glass games weren’t driven by a singular 90s auteur. In fact, the very absence of ego in the studio’s culture meant its many “bright stars” were happy to adhere to a shared vision.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Shaw said Sony were “briefing people in Brussels claiming Microsoft is unwilling to offer them parity for Call of Duty if we acquire Activision,\" but added that “Nothing could be further from the truth.” I would have thought that a legal venue would be a more appropriate place to air these grievances, but I suppose this gets the job done quicker.

Still, some lingering performance woes on the Deck mean I’m probably going to continue Isaac Clarke’s first and worst job on desktop alone.\nTo be fair, the remake is playable on Valve’s handheld. It’s not outright broken, despite having been so on launch day, with problems ranging from drastic FPS dips to outright hard crashes. Following some impressively fast work from Valve themselves, focusing on hotfixes for SteamOS’ Proton compatibility software, Dead Space’s Deck performance has become more or less manageable. But worthy of the best Steam Deck games? Nope, nein and non.\nRead more",

The original was a Japanese-only release back in 2014 on the PlayStation 3, but what a fever dream it was to be dropped into Chapter 3 of the story and let loose on an Edo period Kyoto as none other than Ryoma Sakamoto (multiverse Kiryu). I almost cried, I raced chickens, I caught a big eel, and I've come away with a warm fuzzy feeling inside.\nFrom what I've played of the game's earliest portions, it's Yakuza through and through, to both its benefit and detriment. I don't expect it to convert those who dislike the series, but if you're a fan or a newcomer, it's looking like it'll both be a celebration of its cast, and a remake that feels like an old-school spin on the excellent Yakuza 0. In other words, the perfect introduction point to this mad, but beautiful action series. \nRead more",

Golf caddy, professional skateboarder, even a part-time dragon slayer. Heck, he's recently been back on the second gig train with his stint in Fortnite just earlier this week.

When we first saw the trailer for Shoulders Of Giants, a few people on team responded with murmurings of \"What the hell is this?\", which increased in frequency and volume as more bizarre things appeared on screen. I sort of did what the Goonies do when they first find the map to One Eyed Willie's treasure, or what anyone in Pulp Fiction does when they open the briefcase: \"Wooooaaaah.\"\nConsider the progress of information. It's a sci-fi roguelike best played, I think, in 4-player online co-op. You play a sword-wielding combat mech. You also control a small frog standing on the mech. You drop onto proc-gen planets overrun by a kind of magical accelerated entropy, that turns everything black and pink and grey. By destroying totemic altars orbited by floating eyeball robots, you start to re-energise the planet, so areas have grass and butterflies. Eventually you will destroy enough totems to get to a planetary boss fight, which might be against, for example, a giant ghost samurai or a floating purple hand with an eyeball in it. It's mad, but I sure do wish more games were like this.\nRead more",

Citing that the original message was posted \"in error\" Adams does reiterate that the listed 46 titles are being removed from sale as of February 7, but the remainder of the Xbox 360 Marketplace catalog will remain online.\nRegardless, it's a pretty intriguing error to make, given the definitiveness of the message, complete with a timeframe. Hopefully, we can chalk this one down to crossed wires and blurred communication. You can check out our previous report for a full list of the games that will be removed from the Xbox 360 Marketplace on February 7.\nThe Xbox 360 store won’t be closing down, despite what an Xbox support page says [The Verge]\nThe post Microsoft says Xbox 360 Marketplace closure notice posted ‘in error’ appeared first on Destructoid.",

Yesterday, we learned EA is shuttering Apex Legends Mobile after less than a year of operation. Today, Velan Studios announced it will shut the doors on Knockout City later this year. The game originally launched in 2021 when it was published by EA and quickly scored more than five million players. Last year, the studio announced it would be self-publishing the game starting with Season 6 and making it free-to-play across all platformers. It was a mighty challenge for such a small team, and today, the studio posted a blog update that confirmed Knockout City would end after its next season.\nAccording to the post, the game has reached more than 12 million players…",

That’s why I love fishing games, there are so many analogies I can make for when they launch. That’s practically another one right there! It’ll be coming to PC and all your favorite consoles.\nDredge has you set out into the murky waters to make a living by selling your fishing discoveries and running quests for the inhabitants of the islands. While you’re at it, solve a mystery, upgrade your boat, and strengthen your mind to survive.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfniX3fH1l0&ab_channel=Team17\nI find it difficult to imagine any sport that couldn’t be monumentally improved with eldritch horror.

While containing more than enough easter eggs and homages referencing older series entries, RE7 made a number of major formulaic changes which set it apart from its undead-starring brethren. Instead of blockbuster setpieces or sprawling zombie-infested level layouts, Resident Evil went back to the drawing board, placing the player in (what initially appears to be) an abandoned Louisiana mansion.\nResident Evil 4 took the franchise to new highs. Unfortunately, Capcom saw this as a sign that they should reposition Resident Evil as (almost exclusively) an action, rather than horror, franchise.

          "description": "The daaarkness\nChimera Entertainment has pulled back the veil on their fantasy strategy game, Songs of Silence. While Chimera is mostly known for its mobile games, such as Sacred Legends and Angry Birds Evolution, Songs of Silence will be a whole-fat PC game, and it’s looking rather interesting.\nSongs of Silence will feature narrative-driven, single-player campaigns on randomly generated maps. It features a fantasy world “torn between light and dark” and contains multiple sub-factions locked in an eternal war. There’s a mix of kingdom and hero management and real-time battles that sort of remind me of North and South. You don’t seem to take direct control of your forces in the midst of battle but instead play “powerful combat cards from your heroes.” There are more than a hundred different units, hundreds of cards, and six-person online multi-player.\n[embed]https://youtu.be/Zcrrvsb8P3M[/embed]\nWhile I can understand skepticism when it comes to seeing a primarily mobile developer entering the PC strategy scene, Songs of Silence looks like a real passion project. Chimera Entertainment cites Ogre Battle, Kohan, and Warlords as inspiration for this endeavor. Personally, I enjoy the kingdom management of strategy games. Even with something like the Total War series, my favorite part is the conquest rather than the individual battles.\nIf you need more to sweeten the deal, Hitoshi Sakimoto is signed on as the composer. He was responsible for the Final Fantasy XII, Final Fantasy Tactics, Valkyria Chronicles soundtracks among so many others. If nothing else, it demonstrates an earnest effort to live up to the classics.\nNo release date has been announced, but it is currently available to wishlist on Steam.\nThe post Songs of Silence is bringing its Kingdom Management to PC appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Dash! Dash! Dash!\nIn a release from Konami, the Japanese publisher has drastically cut back its financial outlook for 2023, almost in half. While they initially looked to make an operating profit of 76.5 billion yen, they’ve slashed that forecast to 42.5 billion. That’s a rather sizeable difference, but the publisher isn’t really saying what the cause of it is.\nWhile I’m absolutely biting my tongue trying to speculate on the cause of Konami’s financial woes, people smarter than me suggest it probably has a lot to do with the disappointing performance of eFootball 2023. There is also no indication of when the multitude of recently announced entries in the Silent Hill series are going to drop. They might be planning a release outside the financial year in this report.\nHowever, I’m going to say it’s because they aren’t focusing on the Ganbare Goemon series. Clearly, a renewal of that series would shift mad loot into their coffers. At the very least, maybe less focus on trying to stand out in the mobile market. But what do I know? I’m not a financial bigwig, I’m just one of the people they’re trying to get the money out of.\nSeriously, though, this doesn’t mean Konami is financially imperiled. They’re still bringing in an operating profit, it just means that they’re just not making all of the money.\nThe post Konami slashes its profit outlook for 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

We are a small team and things like this heavily impacts production.” We don’t often hear illness as a reason for delays in this industry, which is rather unfortunate, because it seems like a perfectly valid one considering our games are made by humans who have the tendency to fall ill.\nAmnesia: The Bunker is the latest game in the series that began in 2010 with Amnesia: The Dark Descent. In a big change to the formula, The Bunker includes both combat and a semi-open world map promising to present more of a sandbox horror game. Players will be stalked by an “ever-present gruesome creature,” and resources will shift in every playthrough. Sounds like another immersive sim for the growing sub-genre, and I welcome it.\n\nSet during WWI, the narrative follows French Soldier Henri Clement as he finds himself trapped in an abandoned military bunker. He then must find a way to avoid the aforementioned gruesome creature and escape. I’m not sure if returning to the frontline could really be considered an improvement, but I guess Henri can climb that razor-wire when he comes to it.\nAmnesia: The Bunker will be available on PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam, GOG, and the Epic Games Store on May 16, 2023.\nThe post Amnesia: The Bunker shaken by delay appeared first on Destructoid.",

This is expected to be due to the increased manufacture and availability of PS5 consoles in the latter half of the year, following the extended period of production downtime in the console's debut year, with both a lack of components and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic putting the brakes on the whole industry.\n\nAs a result of the increased shipment figures, Sony has raised its annual quarterly forecast for the remainder of the fiscal year. That is to say, the publisher now expects to ship a further 6.2m units worldwide in the current quarter, resulting in a grand total of 19m PS5 console shipments for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023.\nIn addition to the hardware shipment figures, Sony announced that it sold 86.5m software units (combined PS4 & PS5) during the three-month period ending December 31, 2022. This number is down around 6.2m units on the same period in the previous fiscal year (92.7m). Also continuing to decline are PlayStation Plus subscriptions, with a total of 46.4m subscribers recorded December 31, 2022, a decrease of 1.6m from the same period in the previous fiscal year (48m).\nOverall, however, PlayStation engagement is slightly up, with 112 million monthly active users on PlayStation Network, a one million user increase on the same period ending December 2021.\nThe post PS5 shipments pass the 32 million mark, quarterly forecast raised for March 31 appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's not all for naught, either, as while players enjoy games and explore the park, they will also earn stamps that can be traded in for new Copy abilities as well as various exclusive dress-up masks.\nKirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe launches exclusively on Nintendo Switch February 24.\nThe post New Kirby’s Return to Dream Land trailer spotlights ‘Merry Magoland’ appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Spoilers inside!\nIf you've played through Bayonetta 3, odds are you noticed the soundtrack while blasting away demons and angels alike: and that includes the song \"We Are As One.\"\nPerformed by Rachael Hawnt (who also worked on the lyrics, with music by Hiroshi Yamaguchi), the video is a whopping seven minutes long: mixing in real-life footage of Hawnt and musicians performing the song, on top of cutscenes from Bayonetta 3. Note that the video (as Nintendo warns) does contain spoilers for the game. We won't mention them specifically here, but it does flash through scenes from mid-to-late game Bayonetta 3 story moments amid the footage of the performance. Folks who have finished the game already will likely get more out of it, especially given the emotional resonance of the song itself.\nThis is all great timing, as the powers that be are planning a full OST release for Bayonetta 3 this April, with a whopping 250 tracks across eight CDs. Here's the full breakdown of what the mega-release contains: \"It is the largest in the series, containing more than 250 tracks on 8 CDs. Liner notes are included, including explanations of all tracks and comments from the creators and directors. Beautifully packaged in a three-sided decorative box.

It could perfectly pull off every other detail except the face! It was almost horrific when the Pokémon would turn around and have this blank face, but at least it was easy to tell that it was Ditto. In the games, this little quirk is not present. If you're searching for a Ditto in Pokémon GO, unfortunately, there's no way to distinguish one in disguise from just a normal Pokémon. So how in the world do you catch one?\nHonestly, you just have to get lucky! That's a sucky answer, I know. Unfortunately, you won't know if a Pokémon is a Ditto in disguise until you catch it. Only once it is safely captured in the PokéBall will a little question pop up. Then Ditto's true form will be revealed. Of all of the Pokémon to catch, that has to be the most exciting then!\nThese tricky little blobs are pretty rare, and their shiny counterparts are even rarer. Don't worry though, a shiny Ditto will not be disguised as a shiny Pokémon. You don't have to be afraid that when you finally catch a shiny you've been looking forward to it will turn out to be a blue blob of putty.\nNiantic, the team behind Pokémon GO, doe not release an official list of Pokémon each month that are likely to be the shape-shifter. The whole idea is to have the illusion that it could be any of them. However, some sites, such as IGN, have a running list of likely disguises each month based on anecdotal evidence. People catch Ditto and seem to find monthly patterns, which makes sense from a tech standpoint.\nYou can't really train Ditto, and it's useless in battles, so you might as well just enjoy the lottery. Maybe you'll get lucky, maybe you won't. If you want more concrete tips on catching Pokémon in the mobile game, we have guides on how to catch Leafeon and Glaceon as well as how to catch Kecleon.\nThe post How to catch Ditto in Pokémon GO appeared first on Destructoid.",

Kaizou Choujin Shubibinman Zero (hereby known as Shockman Zero) is an entry in the Shockman series of games. While the series is better known for its entries on the PC-Engine/Turbografx-16, it got its sole Super Famicom release in 1997 via the Satellaview. Over here in the west, we only received Kaizou Choujin Shubibinman 2 in 1992 as Shockman, though it later saw re-release on Nintendo’s Virtual Console service on Wii and Wii U.\nThe Satellaview was an early digital download platform for the Super Famicom, which meant that after that service went offline, the title was no longer available. However, it got re-released in cartridge format via Columbus Circle in 2017. You can still find it available in some places if you’ve got a Super Famicom to stick it in.\n[caption id=\"attachment_360788\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Romhacking.net[/caption]\nShockman Zero is a delicious mix of Mega Man-style platformer and beat-’em-up. It’s as if the Blue Bomber defeated Fist Man and learned to throw hands. It has a distinct Japanese flavor that reminds me of Gunstar Heroes. It’s also a co-op, so you can smite baddies with a friend.\nThe translation comes courtesy of homebrewers Svambo and Anonymousse However, as this was a Japanese-only release previously, this might be the closest we ever get to an official translation. That is, unless a publisher wants to assemble all these games in a collection, which you could absolutely count me on board for.

Younger sibling Maya will be looking to bring down a battalion of hellish opponents with her lethal *checks notes* origami skills, while her older sister Shinobu is, somewhat more traditionally, going with good old-fashioned lead — delivered accurately and with speed.\n\nInti Creates' stylish-looking title shifted onto my radar at the end of the era, thanks to its cool pixelated visuals, cheesecake anime style, and interesting mix of magic and bombastic action. I'll be keeping an eye on this one, and I will hopefully find the time and opportunity to check it out for all of you folks right here at the good ship Destructoid. Lock 'n' load... and fold, I guess.\nGrim Guardians: Demon Purge launches February 24 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.\nThe post PQube is treating Grim Guardians: Demon Purge to a physical release appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Full Scarlet & Violet support is still on the way\nThe last time Pokemon Home got a major update was all the way back in October, but as of today, version 2.1.0 has hit mobile devices. This February 1, 2023 update addresses Pokemon Scarlet & Violet, but it doesn't quite add full Home support just yet.\nPrimarily, it looks at adding ranked battle info in the mix, as well as battle results from Sword & Shield (remember those?!). The catch is that you'll need to link your Home account to a Nintendo account with data from the newest generation: otherwise you won't be able to view said data. This is alongside of the typical \"other issues/various fixes\" vaguery in many AAA franchise patch notes.\nAs a reminder, full Scarlet & Violet access is still on track for \"spring 2023\" according to several listings on The Pokemon Company websites. It can't come soon enough! So far in terms of \"off book\" Pokemon releases we've gotten Charizard, Cinderace, and Greninja: as well as the full evolutionary lines for all three.\nPokemon Home version 2.1.0 full patch notes:\nAdded Ranked Battles information from Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet to the Battle Data feature.\nIf you've linked Pokémon HOME to a Nintendo Account with data from Pokémon Scarlet or Pokémon Violet, you'll now be able to view results from your Ranked Battles in Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet.\nYou can view your battle results from Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield by choosing View Past Battle Records.\nOther issues have also been addressed in order to ensure a user-friendly experience.\nThe post Pokémon Home was just updated to support Scarlet & Violet ranked data appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "You got Wang\nDevolver Digital has announced that the latest entry in the Shadow Warrior series is getting a glow-up in the form of a definitive edition on February 16. Bringing forth some performance upgrades and new features, Shadow Warrior 3: Definitive Edition could be seen as the next-gen version. Existing owners of Shadow Warrior 3 will be getting a free upgrade to the new version.\nOriginally released in 2022, Shadow Warrior 3 took series protagonist Lo Wang back to his single-player roots after the more four-player co-op-focused Shadow Warrior 2. While it’s a more linear take than Flying Wild Hog’s previous games in the revival series, it introduced more movement options with dashing and wall-running.\n[embed]https://youtu.be/GL0mpzLbu1Y[/embed]\nThe headlining features are a survival mode, hardcore difficulty, and new game plus. Survival mode unlocks after you’ve beaten the main storyline and offers up some weapon skins if you can, uh… survive. Hardcore difficulty is, as the name suggests, a more challenging way to play through the game. Meanwhile, New Game Plus is a little less clear, with Devolver Digital saying that it allows you to “Enjoy additional challenges, rewards, and skins to give Lo-Wang that much-needed confidence boost.” They haven’t really said if you get to keep your upgrades for the second playthrough.\nAlong with these additions is hero mode, which introduces a life system to the gameplay. There is also a chapter selection, allowing you to replay your favorite slices of the game.\nIn terms of stepping up to the current generation of consoles, on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, there will be a performance mode for 60fps gameplay, or you can trade that for 4K visuals and 30fps.\nShadow Warrior 3 is currently available for PC, Xbox One, and PS4. The Shadow Warrior 3: Definitive Edition upgrade will add native PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions to the mix on February 16, 2023.\nThe post Shadow Warrior 3: Definitive Edition coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC appeared first on Destructoid.",

Roughly 50 people were on the team working on this game and EA will reportedly attempt to find positions for these employees elsewhere within the company. If positions cannot be found, some might be laid off with severance packages, according to Bloomberg. \n\n\nThe publication says Mohammad Alavi (Titanfall 2, Apex Legends designer) was set to direct this now-canceled game, but he left the company in 2022. \nIt's likely this canceled single-player game set in the Apex Legends and Titanfall universe was the one hinted at back in July in job postings that referred to the game as an \"Apex Universe FPS Incubation Title.\"\nWord of this cancelation comes shortly after EA announced it was shutting down Apex Legends Mobile and Battlefield Mobile, and shuttering the latter's developer, Industrial Toys, as well. Plus, in the same financial results where EA revealed it was shutting these games down, the company revealed that Respawn's upcoming single-player Star Wars game, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, had been delayed to April. \n[Source: Bloomberg]\nDo you think we'll ever get Titanfall 3?

          "description": "Sony's latest financial results covering Quarter 3 of Fiscal Year 2022, which consists of the last three months of the year, reveal the PlayStation 5 had its best quarter on the market yet. \nThe company has surpassed 32 million PS5 units shipped, sitting roughly at 32.1 million, after shipping 7.1 million during the last three months of 2022. It's important to note this isn't a sell-through number so theoretically, there could be consoles sitting on shelves still. But a company ships more units when the demand is there, so it's likely that the majority of these shipped consoles were sold. \nPlayStation did just as well on the first-party software side of things, selling 20.8 million during Q3 of Fiscal Year 2022, which is almost more than double the 11.3 million sold during the same period in 2021. Of those 20.8 million, roughly 11 million were of God of War: Ragnarok, which was the console's big holiday release. \n\n\nIncluding both first and third-party software, 86.5 million units were sold for the PS5, which is less than Q3 of Fiscal Year 2021 (92.7 million) but still an impressive number nonetheless. Sixty-two percent of the software sold this past quarter was digital. \nPlayStation Plus subscribers reached 46.4 million in Q3, which is up from Q2's 45.4 million but down from Q1's 47.3 million. The peak in the PS5's lifetime happened in Q3 of Fiscal Year 2021 at 48 million subscribers.\nIn terms of monthly active PlayStation users, Q3 reached a new peak for the current generation of PlayStation, hitting 112 million. That's up 10 million from the quarter before it and roughly 1 million more than the same quarter in 2021. \nAll told, Q3 of Fiscal Year 2022 was the PS5's best quarter yet. \nDid you pick up a PS5 this holiday season?

          "description": "Sony is closing the PlayStation Plus Collection, the batch of PS4 essentials that PS Plus subscribers on PS5 could download and play for no extra charge. \nIn an email sent to subscribers, the message states that on May 9, the 19-game collection will disappear, and subscribers have until that date to add its games to their game library. Sony didn't provide a reason for why it's closing the collection, but it also clarifies that other PS Plus perks, such as the monthly games, will not be affected. Here’s the full message below:\nThe PlayStation Plus Collection launched alongside the PS5 as an added bonus to those owners. In a way, it served as a mini-version of Xbox's Game Pass, albeit only featuring last-gen titles. The collection has remained largely the same since 2020, with a couple of titles joining the roster and only Persona 5 being removed from the original line-up last year. The PS Plus Collection currently consists of the following titles: \nBatman: Arkham Knight\nBattlefield 1\nBloodborne\nCall of Duty: Black Ops III: Zombie Chronicles Edition\nCrash Bandicoot N.Sane Trilogy\nDays Gone\nDetroit: Become Human\nFallout 4\nFinal Fantasy XV: Royal Edition\nGod of War (2018)\nInfamous: Second Son\nThe Last Guardian\nThe Last of Us Remastered\nMonster Hunter: World\nMortal Kombat X\nRatchet & Clank (2016)\nResident Evil VII: Biohazard\nUncharted 4: A Thief's End\nUntil Dawn\nLast year, Sony added two premium PlayStation Plus Subscription tiers that give those members access to a much larger (and more regularly updated) library of games across multiple generations of PlayStation. Premium members can access most, though not all, of these titles now, so perhaps Sony wants to incentivize standard PS Plus subscribers to upgrade. Regardless, be sure to nab these games now if you haven't already before the May 9 deadline sneaks up on you.",

It is for this reason, after months of working with our development partner, that we have made the mutual decision to sunset our mobile game. Although disappointing, we are proud of the game we launched, are grateful for the support of the Apex Legends community, and are confident that this is the right decision for players.\" \nAll real-world money, in-app purchases have been disabled and the game has been removed from webstores.

For years, we dreamed about a lively city filled with people fighting to become a champion. We strived to create a vibrant place that celebrated the competitive spirit. Our goal was to bring joy back to online multiplayer gaming. The people who gave Rumbleverse a chance and took it on as a new hobby have validated every day that we put into bringing our ideas to life.”\nRumbleverse’s online servers shut down on February 28 at 10 a.m. CST. Players who spent any money on or within the game will receive refunds. That includes the Rumbleverse Battle Pass or Brawlla Bills on any platform. The current battle pass will also be given to all players free of charge with double XP gain. Certain emotes and accessories have been made free to acquire as well. Today, Iron Galaxy will close the in-game store and will release the final update. \nRumbleverse was first announced during the 2021 Game Awards and offered a unique spin to the battle royale with its emphasis on melee combat. After holding various beta tests throughout the first half of 2022, the game fully opened its doors in August to a generally warm reception from players and critics. You can watch us take it for a spin in this episode of New Gameplay Today Live. \nIn similar news, today Konami announced it's turning off the lights to its 2022 social deduction game, Crimesight.",

          "description": "Crimesight, a social deduction game released last year, got a surprising update on its steam page last night. Despite being out for less than ten months, Konami is ending support for it — and making the game unplayable.\n“Thank you for playing CRIMESIGHT,” the news post reads. “This service has continued to operate with the support of many users since its launch in April 2022, but due to various circumstances, we have decided to terminate the service on Monday, May 01, 2023 at 00:00 PDT.”\nSupport for an online game is bound to end at some point, but seeing the service cut off so quickly has many fans caught off guard. This is also the end of more than just the online modes. At the end of the post, Konami writes, “Also, the game itself won’t be able to play.” As a result, recent Steam reviews have a score of “Mostly Negative,” as players warn future buyers from purchasing a product that will soon be unplayable.\n【Important】 Service Termination Announcement\nhttps://t.co/v71WmsKCzE\nJanuary 30, 2023\nCrimesight is a multiplayer social deduction game set in a futuristic London. Moriarty's team seeks to commit a murder, and Sherlock's team tris to stop that from happening. While it was generally received positively by those that did play it, it didn't gain much traction. With only a handful of reviews on Metacritic and extremely low stats on SteamDB, a site that tracks concurrent player count, it's safe to say that one of Konami's \"various circumstances\" for canceling it is the size of its playerbase.\nIf you want to try it out, you've got until February to buy it, and until May before it stops working. If you want to try playing a different social deduction game, I've heard Among Us is good.\nDo you think Crimesight should stay on Steam? Let us know in the comments!",

However, Capcom and Crunchyroll Games are piling on with a new free-to-play mobile RPG called Street Fighter: Duel. If character collection games like Summoners War, Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, and Marvel Strike Force appeal to you, Street Fighter: Duel sounds like it shares many elements with those popular mobile titles.\nStreet Fighter: Duel includes more than 40 Street Fighter characters for players to recruit with the objective of building a team from across the franchise. Each team consists of three fighters who can be leveled up and customized with new skins. These fighters, who include characters like Ryu, Akuma, Chun-Li, Cammy, and more, all feature signature abilities and can pull off various combos through real-time 2D RPG combat or auto-battle mode. In addition to taking on Shadaloo, players can also look forward to head-to-head combat against other players.\n\n\n\"Street Fighter has been an iconic game for generations, and we know anime fans love to go on exciting adventures with beloved characters,\" Crunchyroll Games general manager and Crunchyroll senior vice president of emerging business Terry Li said in a press release. \"We're excited to collaborate with Capcom to bring Street Fighter: Duel and its incredible roster of iconic fighters to anime and gaming fans alike.\nPre-registration for both mobile platforms is available now through the official website. Those who pre-register will be gifted free in-game currency when the game arrives. Street Fighter: Duel is set to launch on iOS and Android in February.",

It came as a total surprise; Castlevania hasn’t had a new release in years, and most of Dead Cells’ other collaborations never amounted to much more than referential skins and a few weapons. To take such a big leap – and to do it with the series that inspired the game in the first place – is a huge step for the indie roguelike.\nWhile Dead Cells was developed by Motion twin, the Castlevania DLC is being developed by Evil Empire, an indie studio made of ex-Motion Twin employees that have handled most of the game’s post-launch content.

The game’s phenomenal blend of action and horror combined with its revolutionary over-the-shoulder gameplay cemented it as a bonafide classic, a magic Capcom hopes to recapture with a modernized remake. That reinvention graces Game Informer’s cover this month. \nWe visited Capcom’s headquarters in Osaka, Japan, to play Chapters One and Five of Resident Evil and speak to its principal designers, including directors Yasuhiro Ampo and Kazunori Kadoi, who previously led the Resident Evil 2 remake.

On top of that, we have a great feature detailing the localization process of MMORPGs and previews for anticipated titles such as Death Stranding 2, Armored Core VI, and Hades II. \nYou can also try to nab a Game Informer Gold version of the issue.

As previously promised, the wait is over because Marvel Snap’s new Battle Mode allows players to take on their buddies, and it goes live today.\nBattle Mode allows players to share battle codes with each other for private one-on-one bouts. This match-up consists of multiple back-to-back games with players using the same decks throughout. Players start with 10 health each and whoever wins a game deals 1 point of damage. However, this damage can be doubled by snapping. A player loses when their health hits zero, and there’s no round limit. Developer Second Dinner states that Battle Mode will receive updates expanding its features over the coming months. \nFor more on Marvel Snap, check out its spot on our Top 10 Games of 2022 to find out what makes it so special.

Made up of multiple netherworlds, the underworld residents followed the bushido code of honor until a tyrannical regime took over to promote a code of destruction. A pair of unlikely allies must team up to stop this threat: a lazy samurai named Futo and a hyperactive otaku girl named Pirilika. \n\n\nDisgaea 7 boasts over 40 character classes, including four new ones: Maiko, Bandit, Zombie Maiden, and Big Eye.

Item Reincarnation lets you transform equipment and items into new forms, such as turning a weapon into a healing item. Auto-battles have been improved with deeper character customization. Now, your forces can stand a better chance against other players' troops in the new online ranked battles. \nUnlike Disgaea 6, a Switch exclusive at launch, Disgaea 7: Vows of the Virtuless will be available on multiple platforms on day one.

Check it out below: \nWhile these two images (and the casting) look great, we still haven't seen Netflix's One Piece show in motion so here's hoping we get a trailer sooner than later.

She was 45. \nWersching was diagnosed with cancer in the summer of 2020 and she died following a two-year battle against it yesterday, January 29. She is survived by her husband Stephen and her three children, Freddie, Ozzie, and Archie. A GoFundMe has been created to help raise money for Wersching's family. \nIn the video game industry, Wersching is perhaps best known for her role as Tess in Naughty Dog's 2013 hit, The Last of Us, but she was also known for her roles in 24 and Bosch, as reported by Variety. Many shared their love of Wersching yesterday following the news of her death, including The Last of Us co-creator and director Neil Druckmann. \nI miss my silly friend who helped bring Tess to life. Annie, you left us way too soon. You will forever be part of the TLoU & Naughty Dog family! 💔\nhttps://t.co/3QTnZtBY4B pic.twitter.com/baNHc1wdCT\nJanuary 29, 2023\nWersching was born in St. Louis, Missouri, and Variety reports that her first screen credit happened at 24 years old in a 2002 episode of Star Trek: Enterprise. From there, Wersching appeared in shows like Frasier, Supernatural, and Charmed, before she received recurring roles in General Hospital and 24. She played Tess in The Last of Us in 2013 and was hopefully able to watch Anna Torv's depiction of her character in HBO's The Last of Us over the past two few weeks. \n[Source: Variety]\nThe staff at Game Informer extends their condolences to Wersching's family.",

Movie, which hits theaters on April 7. In it, we see Donkey Kong begin to pummel Mario, which is a clip we've seen before, before Mario hits a yellow \"?\" block. This gives him the cat suit powerup and while it's useful in the game, that doesn't appear to be the case here as Rogen's Donkey Kong begins to make fun of the suit and Mario's reliance on it. \nCheck it out for yourself in The Super Mario Bros. Movie clip below: \n\n\nAs you can see, this is the most Donkey Kong dialogue we have heard in a teaser for The Super Mario Bros. Movie yet, and it reveals that Rogen's character is basically just him, complete with his signature laugh, too.

While these versions are both largely faithful recreations of the seminal console FPS, key differences exist in ways that don't immediately surface one as the clearly superior version.

News of a second season isn't surprising because The Last of Us' premiere was the second largest debut for an HBO original series since 2010, and its second episode had the largest audience increase from a first episode to a second episode for an HBO Original drama series in the history of the network. \nCheck out the Season 2 announcement for HBO's The Last of Us below: \nThe journey continues. #TheLastOfUs will return for another season on @HBOMax. pic.twitter.com/FQNG6vhk1d\nJanuary 27, 2023\nAs for what to expect in Season 2, that remains unknown, but considering Season 1 is covering all of The Last of Us Part I, it's likely that the second season will cover at least part of The Last of Us Part II, if not all of it.
