          "description": "\"Everyone can always benefit from another pair of hands\".\nFrom the moment it launched in March 2017, Switch quickly carved itself a niche as the console for couch-co-op gaming. Crack off the Joy-Con and in mere moments you have a a multiplayer setup suitable for wherever you happen to be. Soon, a crowd of zany, co-op party games — many inspired by the success of Overcooked! — hit the eShop, and these days it can be tough to tell one colourful co-op caper from another.\nAt first blush, PlateUp! — the work of indie developer It's happening — looks similar to other pleasant, four-player fare, but taking time to fork through its gameplay and sample its delights reveals a culinary co-op game with a very different flavour. Having launched on Steam in 2022, it's built up over 11,000 'Overwhelmingly Positive' reviews — pretty tasty, we're sure you'd agree.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Another great Octo Expansion.\nA few years ago, a cute new action-adventure game called Eastward released on most platforms, blending some appealing EarthBound-esque visuals with a narrative-driven game loop that’s vaguely reminiscent of the older Zelda games. We really enjoyed it, despite its flaws, and it seems that developer Pixpil had some more ideas it wanted to explore for the unique world it built, as it’s now released a sizable DLC called Eastward: Octopia. This siloed expansion adds a lot more than just a few new levels and scenes, effectively acting as a half-sequel of sorts that completely changes up the gameplay. We’d even go so far as to say that it’s a superior game to the original.\nOctopia’s narrative takes place in an alternate universe separate from the main timeline of Eastward; in this world, things are decidedly cheerier and brighter, while there isn’t a hint of miasma to be found anywhere. The story kicks off with Sam and John arriving by train at a mysterious place called Octopia, an abandoned amusement park that’s long since fallen to ruin. The two purchase a small house and a plot of land there to start afresh, and set out to rebuild Octopia to its former glory through their farming efforts. Plenty of alternate-universe counterpart characters from the main plot of Eastward eventually move there to join them in this endeavor, but everyone is just a little different in this iteration.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

We know that Paradox’s ambitious competitor Life By You will arrive this June (assuming no more delays), while EA’s own free-to-play evolution of the OG life-sim series - currently codenamed Project Rene rather than The Sims 5 - is probably still a while off yet. Dropping somewhere in the middle will be Paralives, the promising Patreon-funded up-and-comer led by indie dev Alex Massé, which has been given a fresh look and confirmation of a release date sometime next year.\nRead more",

I might try to pique your interest with caveated comparisons to Vampire Survivors (and previously have), but I'd rather tell you that what hooked me in the wave survival shmup is constant little opportunities to push your luck and skill trying to create advantages.

Haha, but seriously folks. There's a demo for Paper Ghost Stories: Third Eye Open in the Steam Next Fest, and boy howdy did I like just looking at this game in motion. The clue is in the name, as all the characters look like 2D paper cut out dolls, and all the environments are like papercraft models. It's pretty gorge.\nThird Eye Open, out this year, is inspired by the Joss-Papercraft of Southeast Asia (indeed, the start menu is a stage). You play as Ting, a pre-adolescent girl living in Malaysia with her parents. Ting discovers her supernatural ability to see ghosts at a camp, where she meets Xiu, a ghost girl about her own age. The two become friends, and the demo starts in media res when the two are back home.\nRead more",

I just think they're neat. But it really is every so often, presumably because it takes even longer to make a tiny little man out of twigs and spit and scan him into a computer than it does to make him in the computer to start with. Cute miniature puzzle game Lumino City is ten years old, and Trüberbrook is coming up on five. And I first played a tiny snippet of Harold Halibut in 2018. Now, a larger snippet is available for everyone in the Steam Next Fest.\nHarold Halibut is a sort of sci-fi, slightly retrofuturist point and click puzzle game about an undersea society on an alien planet. These people's ancestors blasted off to an ocean planet using the technology of a big science corporation and now, though they can't remember why, they're all pootling about under the water looking at fish. In this world of exaggerated sea-science nonsense, Harold stands out as a sort of beige lab handyman.\nRead more",

But, in case you are looking for demos of more well-known PC games, we've also listed some of the big obvious choices you might want to check out as well (and all the other demos we've written about over the last couple of weeks). You know, because we're nice like that. So come and join us for 15 (plus!) Next Fest demos to get you going. \nRead more",

          "description": "If there’s a secret to how Apex Legends has endured the past five years, an era marked by as many FPS failures as successes, then it might be this: there are no sacred cows in live service. Since its surprise launch in February 2019, developers Respawn Entertainment have chopped and changed everything from hitbox-shrinking Naruto run animations to entire character designs and ability kits, gutting and reworking gear and class mechanics along the way. The incoming Season 20 update, titled Breakout, represents the latest large-scale rejig, adding upgradeable skill tress for its playable Legends that promise MOBA-esque progression and the maddest fights yet.\nThen again, if you actually ask Respawn’s Apex team how they reached this point – as I did when I visited their Los Angeles offices for a Season 20 test run – you’re unlikely to get just one answer. Rather, the battle royale’s unusual longevity in a fiercely contested space is more often attributed to those ongoing work-and-rework efforts themselves, the scope of which sometimes remains a surprise to the developers themselves. As does, according to lead game designer Devan McGuire, Apex’s success.\nRead more",

I was thrilled to see the 5700X3D debut at £233 at Amazon - before stocks were exhausted and it went back up to £240, anyway. \nNow though, the faster 5800X3D has dropped to nearly the same price, just £234 - an even better deal given its higher clock speeds and (very marginally) faster performance. If you're still running an older Ryzen processor and your motherboard can be updated to support the 5800X3D, then I highly recommend this processor, especially if you're using a comparatively low-res 1080p or 1440p display as you're more likely to be CPU-limited at these resolutions!  \nRead more",

Nowadays it means pretty, lovable or charming, albeit perhaps with an undertone of mistrust or contempt, as in the phrase \"that's a cute observation, Edwin\". But the word originally evolved from \"acute\", which very broadly means sharp or intense. \"Acute\" was once a Middle English word for a short-lived fever - it's related to \"ague\", a word you've likely come across in a medieval fantasy RPG somewhere, which refers to fits of sweating and shivering. The word \"cute\", then, is secretly diseased, and so, perhaps, is the experience of cuteness. There's a psychological phenomenon called \"cute aggression\" which refers to the desire to physically envelop, dominate and even abuse the thing you find cute - \"I just want to squeeze you till you pop\".\n Read more",

          "description": "Confession time, folks. Of all the games shown off during The Game Awards last December, Tales Of Kenzera: Zau was the one I glossed over the most. Listen, it was very early in the morning at the time, and it must have come at a peak eyes-glazing-over moment for me. However, having now played the first 30 minutes of Tales Of Kenzera thanks to its just-released early Steam Next Fest demo, I have seen the error of my ways. The demo might only cover the game's opening, but this 2.5D Metroidvania already looks to be quite the promising newcomer in this ever-crowded genre - so much so that it may even be able to go toe to toe with Ubisoft's Prince Of Persia: The Lost Crown. Yep, I went there.\nRead more",

One bullet goes a long way when you can alter the path of its trajectory with each fresh kill you land - as long as they're visible in your immediate eyeline, that is. There are no swoopy swerves going on here, and the thrill of each level is working out the best (and quite literal) angle of attack to take down every last target. I've been playing the first handful of levels of Children Of The Sun over the last week or so, and no word of a lie, this murderous mix of Hitman, Holedown and Sniper Elite has shot straight into my gooey, beating heart.\nRead more",

I think Psychonauts 2 was the last one that really took my breath away, but outside of that (as well as obviously every 3D Nintendo platformer), I often struggle to think of many games that could be considered its equal. There's always something holding them back, isn't there? Whether it's a wonky camera, slightly unwieldly controls, or the platforming itself is just a little too pedestrian to ignite the imagination.\nSo where does Penny's Big Breakaway fit into the equation? This is the next game from former Sonia Mania dev Christian Whitehead's new studio, Evening Star, and yep, you can definitely tell this was made by some real Sonic heads. Penny and her (strangely toothy) sentient yo-yo, err, Yo-Yo, feel like a ball of energy just waiting to bust out across the colourful scenery of their home world of Macaroon, and golly, they sure can fly with just a couple of timely button presses. Alas, there is a but. For me at least, Penny and Yo-Yo are perhaps a bit too energetic for my platforming tastes, and having spent a few hours with an early preview build, I often found them quite a rambunctious pairing to keep under control.\nRead more",

It has also crashed twice during cutscenes. It's a shame, because I've quite enjoyed the bits that I have played (which amount to about half of the campaign, in single player). As a cross section of the three of us who have the game, one hasn't been able to boot it at all, and it works apparently perfectly for the other - and we tested both the retail build and the review build.

The Ryzen 5 8500G is a 6-core / 12-thread processor with RDNA3 graphics that retails for just $179 USD. Here's a look at how it's performing against other AMD and Intel processors on Ubuntu Linux. The Ryzen 5 8500G ends up being decent on the GPU side but making me genuinely excited is the Zen 4C prospects in the low-power space for AI workloads at the edge, low power servers, and other different deployments for great low-power performance.

Unfortunately, the development team couldn't meet the original deadline, but now it's set to launch a NG+ for Peter and Miles next month.\n\n\nWith 2024 in full swing, Insomniac is eyeing a new timeframe to release New Game+ for Spider-Man 2. The team announced today that the highly requested feature, plus a few other additions, will be coming to the quite-popular Sony sequel in March. \n\n\n\n\nInsomniac confirms New Game+, fresh suits, and other additional content will be part of the update on March 7. The Spider-Man 2 developer also teased that \"highly requested features\" are being added at the same time as New Game+, but we won't hear about those until closer to the update's release. \n\n\nAny fans hoping for story DLC to drop soon should probably continue to hold tight. The initial Spider-Man on PlayStation 4 saw the first wave of its City that Never Sleeps content come out a little over a month following the debut of the base game. Spider-Man 2 was released on October 20, and there is no confirmation either way from Insomniac whether additional story content is coming.\n\n\nThe unfortunate Insomniac hack late last year may have indicated there's more in the works. However, internal plans and development cycles frequently change, so nothing is certain until it's officially official. \n\n\nThere are certainly lingering storylines that fans would be excited to see utilized for potential Spider-Man 2 DLC (where the Crimson Hour story goes next, for one). Time will tell if we get just that, or whether we'll have to wait for what's next for the franchise further down the line. \n\nThe post Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 gets New Game+ in March appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Artisan Studios, the developer behind Astria Ascending, has announced their next project. Lost Hellden is an action JRPG that is coming in 2025.\n\n\nAlongside the announcement is a trailer that demonstrates the art style they’re using, which is confusingly called “Deep 2D.” They explain it: \"You play in 3D in hand-painted artworks with dynamic lighting and weather.” To me, it looks like 3D polygonal models with hand-painted textures over hybrid 2D pre-rendered backgrounds. Maybe they’re referring to the way the lighting and real-time weather give the 2D backgrounds some tangible depth. That sort of sounds like how it was done in the 2002 remake of Resident Evil. \n\n\nTrailer via Gematsu\n\n\nAnyway, I’m getting off track. It looks pretty convincing. It reminds me of a more high-fidelity PS1-era JRPG, and I mean that as a compliment.\n\n\nThe gameplay looks like instanced battles that mix “action and strategy.” It features eight characters that you can customize to your play style.\n\n\nThe team working on it features Hitoshi Sakimoto on audio and music, best known for compositions on Final Fantasy XII, Tactics Ogre, and Valkyria Chronicles. The illustrator is Takeshi Oga, who worked on the Gravity Rush and Siren series. That’s some good pedigree.\n\n\nLost Hellden is planned for 2025 on PC and consoles.\n\nThe post The Astria Ascending devs are back with another visually striking RPG appeared first on Destructoid.",

Announced at the State of Play today, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is getting a demo, and it's out today on the PlayStation Store. \n\n\n\n\nThe demo will get you access to the first chapter of Rebirth, with a party of Cloud and Sephiroth in the game's opening. Sometime between today and the release of Rebirth, the demo will also be updated to extend to Cloud, Aerith, Tifa, Barrett, and Red XIII in Junon. There was no mention of whether save progress would carry over or not.\n\n\nPizza in the Sky\n\n\nFinal Fantasy games have been consistently getting demos lately. Last year, we got the fantastic Final Fantasy XVI demo and, before that, Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origins. In fact, in 2020, Square Enix released a demo for Final Fantasy 7 Remake which covered the first chapter. \n\n\nNews of this new Rebirth demo leaked a little ahead of schedule last night, via the Explore page. \n\n\nAs a fan of Final Fantasy 7 Remake, I’ve been hyped about Rebirth for a while.

The Early Access release date for Nightingale has been shifted forward by a couple of days and will now begin on February 20 as opposed to February 22.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Having the game release at the start of the week not only allows our community to get into the game earlier but also gives us time to address any launch issues ahead of what’s sure to be a busy weekend. All in all, we’re excited to get the portal network up ahead of schedule.”\n- Aaron Flynn, Inflexion Games CEO\n\n\n\nWalk the Realms, Realmwalker\n\n\nNightingale just had a successful open-stress test on February 2, opening the window for an earlier release. I had a chance to jump in and play for a bit, and it's become one of my most anticipated upcoming releases.\n\n\nEven though we're in a time of frequent survival crafting game releases like Palworld and Enshrouded, Nightingale has been five years in the making by a team of over 100 developers at Inflexion Games. The team is comprised of many industry veterans including CEO Aaryn Flynn, former GM at Bioware who worked on Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and the Mass Effect franchise.\n\n\nPlayers traverse a \"Victorian gaslamp fantasy\" world with up to five friends, exploring many diverse Realms they access through portals. Along the way, you'll craft unique Realm Cards that influence what lies inside the next portal. You can also plop down your own Estate and build your own home inside these realms.\n\n\nIt's a very ambitious project but from what I saw in the stress test, it looked to be as special as advertised. \n\n\nNightingale releases in Early Access on Steam and Epic Games Store on February 20.\n\nThe post Nightingale Early Access release moved up a couple of days appeared first on Destructoid.",

Like Giant Bomb's Jeff Grubb said, the console war is over. At this point, Xbox and by extension, Microsoft is going to look to make money where it can.

This means players across all platforms—PC(Ubisoft Connect, Epic Games Store), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S can all play together. Furthermore, you can switch between the platforms you are playing on and your data will be saved and available on each.\n\n\nThose who participate in the beta also get access to some exclusive cosmetic rewards including a Basilisk I Culverin cannon, a Sail Emblem and Sail Pattern for your ship, a Cookie the Lemur pet, and a sign language emote.\n\n\nSkull and Bones has had quite a journey over the past few years.

          "description": "Few things are consistent in games. Studios often change and shift over the years, bringing in new ideas and retiring old concepts. But bless Vanillaware, their food has never stopped looking incredible, as the latest trailer for Unicorn Overlord shows.\n\n\nThe most recent entry in Atlus and Vanillaware's series of instructional videos, introducing various gameplay elements in Unicorn Overlord, covers unity and relationships within your party. It's a big army, and as we all know, love can—and will—bloom on the battlefield.\n\n\nImage via Atlus/Vanillaware\n\n\nAllies in Vanillaware's upcoming tactical RPG can build rapport with each other while fighting in the same unit. Eventually, this leads to both in-battle boons and off-hours conversations.\n\n\n\n\nBon Appetit\n\n\nWhile you could just fall in love through combat, food is also a fast way to someone's heart. And Unicorn Overlord certainly seems to have that in spa- oh my, Margherita pizza, my favorite! Vanillaware, how did you know?\n\n\nImage via Atlus/Vanillaware\n\n\nIn all seriousness, food has long been the secret weapon of Vanillaware's art department, and I'm glad to see their fantasy fare has not dipped in deliciousness. Eating meals, as well as gift-giving, is another way to up those bonds and forge new ones in Unicorn Overlord.\n\n\nBetween all this comradery and all the possible classes that could await, Unicorn Overlord is looking like something tactics sickos should keep an eye on. We're not far out from release, either. The latest from Vanillaware is due out on March 8 for PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch.\n\nThe post Unicorn Overlord highlights unity and delicious food in latest trailer appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Obsidian Entertainment's upcoming flagship first-person RPG, Avowed, may have a smudge of weirdness in it. In a recent interview, Avowed director Carrie Patel explained that the game's already iconic mutated skeleton warrior may have been inspired by Jeff Vandermeer's Annihilation, a popular New Weird novel.\n\n\nPress Start's James Wood interviewed Carrie Patel and her fellow director, Gabe Paramo, about Avowed. It's an interesting and engaging piece that helps put much of Avowed's previously shown-off gameplay footage into context, but the really curious bit comes at the end. When checking out Avowed's splayed-out key art skeleton, Wood was reminded of Vandermeer's haunting horror/sci-fi thriller. With that in mind, he brought the matter up with Patel, who was thrilled that he did so.\n\n\nIma…",

          "description": "The Star Wars franchise has always been renowned for its iconic music. The series has earned plenty of big-time nominations and award wins over the last 45 years. Many of these came thanks to one of the best to ever do it in composer John Williams. Now, after last night's Grammy Awards, we add a few more names to that list. \n\n\nStephen Barton and Gordy Haab of Respawn Entertainment nabbed the hardware for Best Score Soundtrack for Video Games and Other Interactive Media, for their excellent work on the excellent Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. Their accomplishment earned the duo a shoutout from the official Star Wars X account. \n\n\n\n\nBarton and Haab beat out some pretty stiff competition for the 2024 Grammy. The duo bested composers who worked on Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, God of War Ragnarök, Hogwarts Legacy, and Stray Gods: The Roleplaying Musical.\n\n\nThis is the second year the Grammys has issued an award in the category of Best Score Soundtrack for Video Games and Other Interactive Media. Last year, Stephanie Economou won the award for her work on Assassin's Creed Valhalla: Dawn of Ragnarök.\n\n\nPrior to 2023, video games could only earn nominations for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media. Only one video game had previously earned a Grammy nomination for its outstanding soundtrack: in 2013, Austin Wintory won for his work on Journey.\n\n\nIt isn't just the Grammy win that the Respawn team should be proud of. For their work on Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, the developer also accumulated numerous nominations across the Golden Joystick Awards, The Game Awards, and The Steam Awards. The game also has four nominations at the 27th Annual D.I.C.E. Awards, which will take place on February 15. \n\nThe post Star Wars Jedi: Survivor soundtrack brings home a Grammy appeared first on Destructoid.",

Several of those have further fueled beliefs that Microsoft and Xbox are looking to shift towards third-party options, including PlayStation.\n\n\nLet's start with the reports themselves. Over at The Verge, Tom Warren reports from a source familiar with Microsoft's plans that Bethesda is considering bringing Indiana Jones and the Great Circle to PlayStation 5.  Furthermore, a new \"multi-platform approach\" is emerging within Microsoft, as The Verge reports, which would lead to some titles remaining exclusive and others heading to external platforms in the future.\n\n\nThe second match lighting the powder keg was a report from XboxEra.

In addition to touting an AI learning opponent feature for Master Duel and VR experience with Duel Links, a collection of classic Yu-Gi-Oh titles served as the big new game announcement.</p>\n\n<p>Dubbed Yu-Gi-Oh! Early Days Collection, this compilation consists of the very first Yu-Gi-Oh games ever released, including titles only available in Japan. Konami only revealed one game in the collection: Yu-Gi-Oh Duel Monsters 4: Battle of Great Duelists for the Game Boy Color, which launched in Japan in 2000 and never came to the West.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Yu-Gi-Oh Early Days Collection has no release window, but it will be available for Switch and PC via Steam. Konami plans to announce the other titles in the collection in the future, so you can start building your wishlist now. There are a ton of Yu-Gi-Oh games (to say the least), but as a long-time fan, I’ll be happy if Forbidden Memories, The Eternal Duelist Soul, or (perhaps less likely) The Duelists of the Roses make the cut.</p>",

The news was announced during today’s State of Play.</p>\n\n<p>The game, which first entered Steam Early Access in May 2022, puts players in the immortal shoes of a weak vampire who awakens after slumbering for centuries. Players must regain their strength and rebuild their castle, which, among other things, involves enslaving humans to do their bidding. Whatever your method of rebuilding your might and fending off foes, you’ll have to plan around a day/night cycle since sunlight is a big no-no for your well being. V Rising can be played alone or alongside friends in multiplayer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameBorder=\"0\"  allow=\"autoplay\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_UIvPe5W2Sw\" width=\"640\"></iframe>\n\n<p>Interestingly, since Sony doesn't have an Early Access style program, one has to wonder if V Rising’s arrival will coincide with an impending 1.0 launch on PC. V Rising was a <a href=\"https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/05/31/v-rising-reaches-15-million-copies-sold-in-just-two-weeks\">big hit when it first arrived on Steam</a> and has garnered positive reviews, so here's hoping the experience translates well on console.&nbsp;</p>",

Not only that, but it is, as Kojima put it, an \"action espionage\" game.</p>\n\n<p>If that genre sounds vaguely familiar in relation to Kojima, that might be because the tagline of his global breakthrough, Metal Gear Solid, released in 1998, used the tagline \"Tactical Espionage Action.\" In normal people's terms, that means a stealth game.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameBorder=\"0\"  allow=\"autoplay\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WEpK67JDLu8\" width=\"640\"></iframe>\n\n<p>Kojima's return to the stealth genre, one he pioneered decades ago with the Metal Gear series, is still quite a ways off. As he tells it, development will begin in earnest after Death Stranding 2 is released sometime in 2025.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>He then went on to say a bunch of stuff that didn't make a ton of sense, though maybe one day it will in retrospect. This new game will also apparently be a movie \"in terms of look, story, theme, cast, acting, fashion, and sound,\" Kojima said, before adding that with this new game, Kojima Productions hopes to \"transcend the barriers between film and video games.\"</p>",

Dave the Diver is headed to Playstation in April, meaning that players who weren’t able to catch the game on Switch or PC will now have a chance to join Dave on his adventures.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">As we highlighted in <a href=\"https://www.gameinformer.com/review/dave-the-diver/a-refreshing-departure\">the game’s review</a>, Dave the Diver was one of the welcome surprises of last year, offering a novel and amusing mix of gameplay experiences. Part of the game focuses on scuba diving and fishing, while another section of the game is about managing and growing a sushi restaurant, using the ingredients you gathered from the ocean. The game has a whimsical, lighthearted vibe and consistently entertaining gameplay, which together has garnered a lot of praise.</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameBorder=\"0\"  allow=\"autoplay\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wbeb9xmOPoU\" width=\"640\"></iframe>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Alongside the release on PlayStation consoles, we also got a tease of a new crossover coming to Dave the Diver, in which Godzilla shows up in the strange waters of the Blue Hole. If we get to make sushi from a kaiju, it will be an awesome day, indeed. That new expansion to Dave’s adventure is set to arrive in May.</p>",

Trying desperately to prove his species worth as something better than merely meat to be ground into intergalactic fast food burgers.\nThe ScummVM Team is pleased to announce full support for Orion Burger, the classic game by Sanctuary Woods. The engine also adds a few niceties that the original didn't have, such as mouse wheel handling, and using the spacebar to skip walk animations - something the original didn't do properly.\nHelp us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game's logic was all hardcoded, so we really need people to try all sorts of weird actions, and make sure the game handles everything correctly and matches the original implementation. And please take some screenshots along the way.\nNow, luck be with you. And remember, with the aliens cheating on the tests they set up for you, this will be no easy task.\n>",

In the upcoming weeks we will share more posts explaining some of these features in depth. For now, we need your help testing our work. We need as many people as possible to test this beta version of the 14.X release series, so you can find and we can squash as many bugs as possible before the actual release. To guide you a bit towards what you should be looking for: Generic gameplay bugs and crashes. There is a new Ship Pathfinder; test it out. Buoys are optional to use. You can now automatically unbunch your vehicles at a depot. We added our own interpretation of daylength to the game. More on this soon in another blog post. There are many GUI improvements throughout the game. More consistent look, better GUI scaling. There are many more things worth talking about, and this will be made more clear when we approach the release of 14.0. But for now, play the game, and please report any issues you find. The usual titlegame competition has also been announced on the forums. See the page for the exact competition rules if you are interested. Download Changelog Bug tracker",
