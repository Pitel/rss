          "description": "You have to draw the line somewhere.\nRailbound, the latest title from Polish studio Afterburner, makers of Golf Peaks and inbento, is a super-cute puzzler of polished presentation and deceptively monstrous difficulty. It starts ever so innocently, asking for a little railway line to connect a carriage to its engine, and sings with toots and chuffs as a billow of smoke from the locomotive clears to reveal the next stage. By the 100th level, however, it becomes a head-scratcher that’ll wear your nails to nubs.\nThe goal is to couple cars to engines in numbered order. A level starts with one to four cars spaced around a grid and the engine sitting at the edge of the play area. You have a fixed number of track pieces that can go in any direction, turning and branching off each other. You connect the cars to the engine with rails such that car number one will arrive there first, followed by number two and so on. When you press go, the cars rattle along charmingly and you see if your plan worked. It’s so intuitive a concept that we’d played a good 20 levels before we realised that this is absolutely not how trains work.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The first game in the series has seen a whole host of remakes and releases, with the latest, Front Mission 1st: Remake, landing on Nintendo Switch. It brings all the drama and fantastic storytelling that have become the hallmarks of the series along with a modern look and sound for current audiences.\nThe plot of Front Mission 1st: Remake follows the conflict between two coalitions of nations. The OCU, which represents nations in the South Asian, South East Asian, and Australian regions, and the USN, which represents the North and South American continents, are locked in an ongoing cold war. Each wants control of Huffman Island and has sent their wanzer forces to shift the balance of power on the island in their favour.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

I say this while sitting in a Pikachu-branded chair, with my handmade Snom figurine hanging out on my desk next to my my off-brand plastic Swinub figurine, having played 90% of the available Pokémon games out there (I didn't bother with Black and White 2 and I didn't like Sun and Moon enough to get the Ultra version). But it's true. In a lot of ways, I am the Pokémon player that everyone complains about — the one who buys the games, has an okay time, wishes they were different, and then buys the next one anyway.\nThe thing is, it's more complicated than that. I love a lot of things about Pokémon, or I wouldn't keep shelling out for the games and the merch, would I? I love a lot of the designs from each generation, I love the increasing character customisation, and I love playing with friends and having an incredibly fun time messing around in Raid Battles. I love the innovation that each game brings, I love sharing discoveries online with the whole community, and I love choosing a starter all over again. See? I love a lot of things. At least six things.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "For the last ten years, the XCOM designers at Firaxis have traded in 'if's and 'maybe's. If this shot lands, then maybe I can pull off this carefully calculated plan I’m brewing. It's exactly the kind of taut, knife-edge tension we've come to love and expect from their turn-based strategy games, but Marvel's Midnight Suns takes a different approach. As the titular demon hunters join forces with some famous Avengers faces to take down the evil sorceress Lilith and Marvel mega villain Chthon, there's never any question about whether your moves will or won't work here. You're playing as the world's most powerful superheroes. Of course, they’re going to work. And forget about cowering behind knee-high cover walls, too, because if you're not already bulletproof, you've certainly got the reflexes and supercharged muscle mass to soak up anything Lilith’s Hydra minions are going to chuck at you.\r\n\nQuestion is, by tipping the power scales in your favour like this, do you risk destroying that delicate balance of risk and reward? At first glance, it's easy to think a more reliable set of heroes would end up dulling what made Firaxis' XCOM games so special, but the result is something equally thrilling. Given how the Marvel machine has drawn in and chewed up so much singular creative talent in the wider MCUniverse, Firaxis emerging with their cred intact is nothing short of extraordinary. Not only have they endured their radioactive spider bite, they've come out bigger and better for it, creating not only the best Marvel game I've played, but one of the best superhero games full stop.\nRead more",

          "description": "Somewhere in the region of 8,000 games have been removed from Steam since its inception, from the mass banning of “fake games”, to publishers removing their own titles due to licensing disputes, pending re-releases, personal disillusionment, server shutdowns and political scandals. Valve even took down one of its own games. Released in 2004 with Steam AppID 92, Codename: Gordon is a Flash-based 2D side-scroller set in the Half-Life universe, developed by Nuclearvision and published by Valve. It was removed due to a hard-coded link to the now-defunct developer’s domain, which Valve regarded as a security risk.\nBut removed isn’t always the same as gone, and exploring Steam’s deleted items is an adventure through modern gaming history. I spoke to some developers of delisted games to find out more.\nRead more",

I'm not a big kid person, typically, but you'd have to be beyond heartless not to love little Clem, wouldn't you?

          "description": "Card-based strategy games seem to have really found their feet over the last 12 months. Now that we're a few years clear of Slay The Spire's chokehold over the genre, deckbuilders are starting to come thick and fast in a variety of exciting mash-ups. This year alone, I've sunk a hefty number of hours into the deckbuilding tower defence 'em up ORX, got lost in the tabletop plots of Foretales, and later this week we'll see the launch of Marvel's Midnight Suns, the new card-based strategy RPG from XCOM makers Firaxis. It's a good time to be a fan of deckbuilders, is what I'm saying, and early next year the mythological exploits of Mahokenshi will be looking to carry the baton forward into 2023. \nMade by the Paris-based Game Source Studio, this turn-based strategy battler sees you take control of four types of samurai as you seek to bring balance to a mystical realm above the clouds. Oni, goblins and other creatures from Japanese myth are your primary antagonists here, but its hexagonal islands are also stuffed full of text-based narrative events, sidequests, and treasure troves to uncover. It's a lot to take in, but the latter in particular are vital to your success. That's because every time you start a new mission in Mahokenshi, you'll be going in with a completely fresh deck - and based on an early preview build I've been playing recently, it's both an ingenious way to keep things feeling fresh, but it can also be a double-edged sword when it comes to trying out new tactics.\nRead more",

Hitting that milestone means the group have decided to change how they operate and adjust their Patreon. They’ll no longer be working to release one game per month. Sokpop are recommitting to releasing another 100 games though, so they’ll still be surprising us with intriguing diversions like village-building card game Stacklands or cutesy RTS King Pins. You can watch a trailer for their recently released 99th game, action RPG Springblades, below.\r\n\n \nRead more",

For decades, cyberpunks, hackers, and internauts have donned a cool pair of shiny shades to strike a cool pose. But mirrorshades are a serious security hazard in this age of video calls: other people can see your screen and desk reflected in the lenses. If you're mirrored up, people can gain access to private data or see if you are, for example, playing Windows Solitaire instead of paying attention to the meeting. So what's a 21st-century cyberpunk to wear? It's not like you can go without cool glasses (or stop playing Solitaire during meetings). I have ideas.\nRead more",

I remember it not only because the content is burned into my brain, but because they themed it around getting involved in cosplay, and got a bunch of cosplayers - and no disprespect to them, because they did a great job - to dress as characters from the games. And I kept thinking, like... what? Apart from Ms Drew, what characters are worth cosplaying from a series of licensed Nancy Drew puzzle games?\nAnyway it clearly didn't matter, because I saw the ads so often that I went and bought the most recent one out of curiosity. You win, Her Interactive! Midnight In Salem is a spooky mystery wherein Nancy Drew must solve an arson case (with the Hardy Boys in tow, no less) that has possible occult tie ins. It came out in 2019, and is Nancy Drew #33. 33 Nancy Drew games! Imagine. Also, I cannot download it and I have spent over two weeks trying.\nRead more",

Chained Echoes, the retro Japanese-inspired RPG he's been working on as a solo dev for the last seven years, is almost ready to release on Steam, but he tells me there's \"still so many little and not so little things to do\" before the big day hits on December 8th. \"[I] still need to patch the languages into the console versions. Still need to pass one submission,\" he says over email. \"I can’t really think about the release itself, just about the things I need to finish till then.\"\nBut he also says he's \"happy at the same time\". After a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2019, Chained Echoes has been gradually gathering steam ever since - and judging by the 90-minute demo I was able to play recently, it's clear Linda's got something really quite special here. Not only do its 16-bit-style visuals look absolutely stunning, but its turn-based combat's also unlike anything else I've seen. You've still got your classic list of commands to pick from, but as battles progress you'll need to maintain a kind of flow state known as Overdrive to deal the optimum amount of damage. Overextend your party's abilities and you'll leave yourself vulnerable to critical hits from your enemies, but go too slow and you'll need to build your Overdrive bar back up to regain those lost stat buffs. It's a fascinating system, and was borne out of Linda's desire to \"build a bridge between the worlds\" of considered, turn-based tactical combat and the fast-paced action of real-time.\nRead more",

There are other things you can do, like ducking, and jumping, and throwing your sword. But so many fights come down to a tense little close-range shuffle where each player stands just out of range of the other's blade, moving their sword higher and lower in a seconds-long game of chicken.\nOh look, now I'm holding rock! Can you switch to paper fast enough? Nope, now I'm holding scissors! Oh, and now it's paper! Now rock again! Now paper! What will you do?... Oh. You can just jump over me and keep running.

It's not often that I recommend one here, and jokes aside, it'd be unfair and untrue to say it's because there aren't enough good ones. It's more that I don't have much room for new ones.\r\n\nLilith Odyssey is, if we must, a survival game and a roguelike (oh, the many dispara-[yeah alright, alright. Jesus. - ed.]), but that is reductive. This is a strange and somewhat contradictory game I feel uneasy comparing directly to anything, except possibly the wonderful Taxinaut (which is now on Steam, incidentally). Lilith Odyssey is very much what I'd call a vibes-based game.\nRead more",

It's been a strange couple of hours.\nDabloontok is TikTok’s newest trend, and is probably best described as a chaotic player-generated RPG where users collect an imaginary currency called \"dabloons\" cashed out by awkwardly photoshopped black cats (usually) in fantasy settings. These cats will either gift you dabloons, steal your dabloons, or tell you what you can do with your dabloons. It's as simple as that, and so far there more than 520 million views on the dabloons hashtag. It’s kinda wild.\nRead more",

It's a medieval murder mystery with monks and manuscripts and other m things - including the protagonist, who is an artist called Andreas Maler. It's inspired by The Name Of The Rose, a murder mystery similarly focused on a medieval scriptorium in a monastary (and notable for being adapted into a film where Sean Connery is a detective monk aided by a tiny baby Christian Slater).\nIn the ol' days books, were copied by monks onto parchment made of animal skin. Most people weren't educated enough to read, in case poor people got radical ideas like maybe they should get some rights, and controlling the flow and spread of information was one of the things that made the church as powerful as it was. Pentiment takes place just as printing presses are becoming popular, which makes access to knowledge more readily available. Part of how the game conveys this is through the dialogue - not the stuff people are saying, although that helps, but what their speech bubbles looks like when they talk. You've probably already heard this, but I want to show you in a bit more detail.\nRead more",

          "description": "Nintendo taking player feedback 'seriously'\nToday sees the launch of the first major update for Nintendo's Pokemon Scarlet & Violet, but while Update 110 will add some new features to the juggernaut-selling Switch releases, those plucky trainers hoping for a hefty run of performance improvements are, sadly, going to be left wanting.\nThe core element of Pokemon Scarlet & Violet Update 1.10 is the addition of Ranked Battles, which will allow players to fight for glory within the confines of the Battle Stadium of Paldea. This new, seasonal-based mode kicks off today with Series 1, allowing trainers to chase the rank of Pokemon Master through showdowns with their fellow players — using the cache of critters they have tucked away within their respective Pokedex. In addition, special events and tournaments will be held on a regular basis as the season progresses.\nHowever, in regards to improving Pokemon Scarlet & Violet's heavily publicized technical issues, Update 1.10 only promises a handful of undisclosed \"bug fixes\". In an additional statement published alongside the official patch notes, Nintendo said that it was aware of the performance issues that are being suffered by the millions of players who picked up one (or both) of the games during launch week, and that it is working on improvements to the games — noting that it was taking player feedback \"seriously\".\nReleased on November 18 exclusively on Nintendo Switch, Pokemon Scarlet & Violet sold over 10 million copies within the first three days of release, making it Nintendo's biggest launch of all time.\nThe post Pokemon Scarlet & Violet 1.10 update adds Ranked Battles but few fixes appeared first on Destructoid.",

He's also the producer of upcoming RPG Final Fantasy XVI.

It's currently aimed for summer 2023, so a date might not be out of question.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ih0fVVtmiB4\n \nWhatever the case, it does seem like the next Final Fantasy is nearing closer and closer. Little tidbits and signs like ratings seem to indicate Square Enix is setting up the runway. This will be the first new Final Fantasy since 2016's brotastic road trip Final Fantasy XV, so there are some expectations and hopes in store that have possibly wavered a bit over the last few months.\nEither way, chalk that up for another potential world premiere for The Game Awards 2022.

          "description": "Call of Duty remains the Golden Goose\nMicrosoft continues in its dogged efforts to seek approval from European antitrust regulators over its purchase of Activision Blizzard. The deal, which was announced almost a full year ago, would see Microsoft take ownership of the video game publisher for the hefty sum of $68.7 billion USD.\nBefore the deal can be completed, Microsoft must seek the approval of various global commissions, ensuring that there will be no antitrust issues from the meeting of two of the industry's biggest companies. The European Commission is yet to offer its approval for the purchase, going as far as to launch a full investigation into the proposed deal. The commission is charged with declaring its decision before April 11, 2023.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r72GP1PIZa0\nAt the center of myriad angles on this whole endeavor lies Activision's billion-dollar franchise, Call of Duty. Sony has been unashamedly loud in its concerns that making the military shooter franchise an Xbox exclusive will severely harm the PlayStation market. And while Microsoft had offered up an agreement to keep Call of Duty a cross-platform release for \"at least three years\", Sony rejected this offer, with CEO Jim Ryan openly calling it \"inadequate on many levels\".\nAccording to world news outlet Reuters, Microsoft might be preparing to make Call of Duty the ace in securing global approval for the Activision purchase. Reuters suggests that MS might offer Sony a 10-year licensing — a good-faith gesture intended to sway antitrust concerns. Regardless, there is still some way to go, as while the purchase has been unconditionally cleared in many territories — including Brazil, Serbia, and Saudi Arabia — The EU Commission and U.S. FTC regulators will take more convincing.\nThe post Microsoft ‘likely to offer concessions’ to achieve Activision deal approval appeared first on Destructoid.",

New playable characters, a photo mode, challenges, and more are all in store for Sonic Frontiers in 2023.\nThe DLC roadmap was laid out today on the Sonic social accounts. Three big updates are planned for 2023, and they're set to be free for all Sonic Frontiers owners. The content and names of said content are subject to change, Sega notes.\nUpdate 1 will consist of a juke box for all those excellent tunes, as well as a photo mode. So yes, you'll be able to take some Sonic Selfies. Those two pieces are joined by new challenge modes to tackle, which may include the golden Super Sonic.\n\nIn Update 2, it's Sonic's birthday! Plus, an Open Zone Challenge and new Koco. I am definitely curious to see what a Sonic birthday party looks like.\nThen, the heavy hitters arrive in Update 3. Playable characters and new story are both due out in Update 3, and it looks like a doozy. We have a teaser of the Frontiers villain, as well as portraits for Tails, Knuckles, and Amy. The implication seems to be that the Sonic crew will be playable in some way, but we'll doubtless learn more in the new year.\nNow it's a party\nHow those different characters, who often have pretty distinct playstyles from Sonic, will fit into the world of Sonic Frontiers will be interesting to see if that's how it pans out. Knuckles and Amy can definitely handle some combat, and flying around as Tails in a big, open space could be fun.\nWe'll find out more of what's in store as we get closer to the launch of these new updates. In the meantime, Sonic Frontiers is still a fairly fresh game, so this might be the sign for holdouts to try it out if they want to check out all the extra content later.\nThe post Sonic Frontiers is getting new playable characters, story, and more in 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

The project's been in development since, with the release window shifting in the meantime. Now, Goodbye Volcano High is aiming for a summer 2023 launch.\nAlongside the news today is a trailer, showing off some of what's in store for the prehistoric school year. While the art direction is an immediate draw for some, today's trailer also spotlights gameplay from KO_OP's story.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqpRNQGHB_o\nThere's dialogue options, which will likely have some ramifications down the line for Fang, the lead. Or maybe jamming to music's more your style, or taking photos. When the cataclysm is nigh, what should you do with your time?\nMeteoric rise\nThat's the crux of Goodbye Volcano High: the world is ending, an era is being put to a close. So what do you do with the time remaining? It's a bit heavy, for sure.\nBut as someone who hadn't been sold on the concept just yet, today's trailer has honestly won me over a bit. The music is fantastic, and all the style added to dialogue, rhythm, and other segments give Goodbye Volcano High a bit of added flair. I've seen some narrative games do impressive things with how they stylize basic chats and conversations.\nIf making the most of life's little dramas before imminent doom sounds up your alley, Goodbye Volcano High is aiming for a summer 2023 launch.\nThe post Dino school story Goodbye Volcano High gets a summer launch window appeared first on Destructoid.",

You can also try all this out yourself...now!\nHere's how to try out the Valheim Mistlands update now\nGo to Steam, right-click the game, and hit properties\nUnder the beta section, enter \"yesimadebackups\" (without the quotes) and click the option that appears\nThat's it! You can try it out in public test form, and there's more official instructions here if you're running into issues.\nHere's another very important note about the upcoming content from a test perspective:\n\"An important thing to note is that the Mistlands biome will only generate in areas you have not yet discovered. Therefore, if you have explored a lot of your world, you might be better off starting a new one in order to actually be able to travel to the Mistlands.

          "description": "To the Batmobile\nGrab your batarangs, cattle prods, and... erm... magical stun bullets, as Warner Bros Montreal has released a new update for its DC Comics-inspired adventure, Gotham Knights — Now available for free on all platforms, the Heroic Assault content drop adds new co-op action for our caped vigilante force.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fX22XjOJ9-k\nThe new update consists of two all-new standalone gameplay modes, both focusing on multiplayer mayhem for heroes Robin, Nightwing, Batgirl, and The Red Hood. The first mode \"Heroic Assault\", is a tower-climbing survival challenge, and allows up to four players to pick their way through 30 floors of increasingly dangerous enemies and boss battles. Should your squad reach the top of the tower, they will face not only the human hybrid Man-Bat, but, somewhat surprisingly, they will also have to tackle the alien lifeform Starro the Conquerer!\nThe second mode, \"Showdown\" will allow one of two players to take on supercharged versions of the main boss battles from Gotham Knights' story mode, such as Harley Quinn, Mr. Freeze, and Talia Al Ghul. As players defeat each megavillain, they will be rewarded with brand new in-game goodies, including legendary gear blueprints and unique colors for character suits and Batcycles. Both Heroic Assault and Showdown are made available once each competing player has defeated Gotham Knights' rogues' galley.\nGotham Knights is now available on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X.\nThe post Battle Starro in Gotham Knights free ‘Heroic Assault’ update appeared first on Destructoid.",

Movie aired during today's Direct, specifically spotlighting the movie. Sorry, no Mario game news to share.\nWhat we did get to see was much more of the cast, including Luigi, Princess Peach, and Donkey Kong. There are gladiatorial games, platforming, a Bowser torture scene, and even some Mario Kart happening on the Rainbow Road.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnGl01FkMMo\nFrom a training segment involving some floating platforms and hazards to DK slapping the dickens out of Mario, this definitely has a bit more of a Mushroom Kingdom vibe. Plus, we've heard a good chunk of the movie's cast now giving their takes on these classic Nintendo characters.\nOff to the Mushroom Kingdom\nWe got our first official trailer for The Super Mario Bros. Movie not too long ago. That Direct featured both Chris Pratt (playing Mario) and Jack Black (Bowser) discussing their work on the film, then segueing into the full trailer. This time around, we got an intro from Anya Taylor-Joy, who plays Princess Peach, and Seth Rogen, who plays Donkey Kong.\nWhile the first trailer set the stage, this second one feels like it gives a pretty good idea of what the upcoming Nintendo and Illumination film will be like. An everyman-versus-Bowser isekai is certainly a way to take the Mario story, but I'm not entirely against it. We'll see how it comes together when The Super Mario Bros.

          "description": "But some players are disappointed at stripped-down status\nActivision has relaunched the original edition of Call of Duty Warzone, the battle royale variant of its best-selling military franchise. The publisher had previously removed the title in order to spotlight its successor, Warzone 2.0, but has now reopened servers for the original bullet-pumping multiplayer title.\nRemonikered \"Warzone Caldera\", the original Warzone is now available as a separate entity, featuring only two modes — Quads and Solos — and only one map — the titular Caldera. Additionally, Warzone Caldera has to be downloaded as a separate platform, adding a lot of sweaty weight to Call of Duty's already mammoth HDD footprint. For these reasons listed and others, die-hard Warzone 1.0 fans are disappointed in the title's \"stripped down\" reappearance.\nThis is an unfortunate inevitability with multiplayer-only titles, and battle royale releases especially. It's vitally important to an online game's lifespan that focus is placed on everyone \"moving forward\", as it were, ultimately ostracizing the players that may have been quite happy with the way things already are. It probably wouldn't take all that much time and effort for Activision to restore Warzone Caldera to its original status, but this, obviously, is unlikely to happen.\nActivision and developers Raven Software and Infinity Ward will be focusing their time, money, and resources on the sequel, putting all of their eggs snugly into the Warzone 2.0 basket. The publisher and its subsidiaries will be doing all it can to ensure that Warzone's huge global player base does the very same.\nCall of Duty: Warzone 2.0 is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.\nThe post Original Call of Duty Warzone relaunched as Warzone Caldera appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Fly me to the moon\nA new month is almost upon us, and the PlayStation Plus games for December have leaked just before the date ticked over.\nDealabs, which has leaked the list of PS Plus games before, has the alleged games for this coming month. The Mass Effect Legendary Edition is reportedly due up, as is Biomutant and Divine Knockout, or DKO.\nThese games will reportedly be headed to PlayStation Plus' Essential tier, the base level of PS Plus in Sony's tiered structure.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8i53TtQ6IQ\nThe Mass Effect Legendary Edition needs little introduction. It's a remastered collection of the Mass Effect trilogy, putting the whole thing in one tidy, neat package. And frankly, if it's going up on PS Plus, there's even fewer excuses to not dip into this and try it. There's not many other RPGs out there that do what this trilogy did.\nBiomutant is the rodent post-apocalyptic action game from Experiment 101 and THQ Nordic. It dropped last May and seemed like it got an okay reception. If you like the idea of playing as woodland critters with gritty looks and weapons, this might be up your alley.\nAs for Divine Knockout, that's a new multiplayer game from Red Beard Games and Hi-Rez Studios. According to a Steam page listing, it's a third-person platform fighter that seems to take a more 3D approach to its smashing and bashing.\nLast chance for last month's games\nKeep in mind that the changing of the calendar month also means November's games are rotating out. As the December PlayStation Plus games hit, the November ones depart. So if you've yet to pick them up, sooner's better than later.\nFor November 2022, the list included Nioh 2, Heavenly Bodies, and the LEGO Harry Potter Collection. Those will rotate out sometime in December, so be sure to nab them if you want them.\nThe post December PlayStation Plus Essential games have leaked appeared first on Destructoid.",

After all, more than 10 million people have already purchased it, and millions more have already made up their minds about it after seeing the many clips of its bugs and glitches posted across social media. Outside of a few days when I had to avoid getting killed by COVID, I’ve wrapped all my free time over the last week and some change into becoming the best Pokémon trainer the Paldea Region has ever seen. I’ve ventured to the top of the highest mountain and tunneled deep into the earth to see the wonders within.\nAs with past mainline Pokémon games, it’s been an adventure with good friends and great little monsters to collect.

          "description": "Narrative dinosaur adventure Goodbye Volcano High has awakened from dormancy with a new gameplay trailer and a 2023 release window. The title, unveiled in June 2020 as one of the first PlayStation 5 titles, will now arrive sometime next summer.\nGoodbye Volcano High is a choice-driven teenage coming-of-age story starring Fang, a high school student, aspiring musician, and if you didn’t notice, a pterosaur. Alongside their bandmate Trish and other friends, the dino teens are faced with making the most of their final days together. Developer KO-OP describes the narrative as a tale of “personal growth, acceptance, and the power of community.” A new teaser trailer provides the first look at gameplay, showing off the dialogue interface and rhythm mechanics. \n\n\nKO-OP initially planned to release Goodbye Volcano High in 2021. However, last August, the small team pushed the launch into 2022 due to COVID-related development challenges and the decision to reboot the game’s narrative. The game still didn’t make a peep throughout 2022, and KO-OP says this latest delay stems from continued challenges related to the pandemic and the game’s large scope relative to the team’s size. For example, KO-OP states that over 6,000 voice lines have been recorded on top of completing a significant amount of “bespoke” animations. \nGoodbye Volcano High is slated to launch on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC via Steam.",

          "description": "Warner Bros. Discovery revealed last month that it had hired Peter Safran and Marvel Studios alum and director James Gunn (Guardians of the Galaxy, The Suicide Squad, Peacemaker) to lead as co-CEOs of DC Studios, as reported by Variety. Since then, Gunn has been fielding questions about DC Studios, the DCU's future, and what his plans are as a new lead within DC's entertainment output. \nWhen asked on Twitter yesterday if he and Safran are \"planning to give more DC characters TV shows that'll add to the story for the DCEU,\" Gunn responded, \"Yes, most definitely, the DCU will be connected across film and TV (and animation).\" In a follow-up tweet, another user asked is there are plans to connect games to this larger DCU canon as well, to which Gunn simply responded, \"Yes.\" \nYes.\nNovember 27, 2022\nIt's an interesting response and idea, especially given that it seems clear Warner Bros. Discovery wants its DCU to become something more akin to Marvel Studios' MCU. However, MCU plans don't include video games because Marvel's video game efforts through partners such as Insomniac Games (Marvel's Spider-Man), Crystal Dynamics (Marvel's Avengers), and others do not connect in any way.\nIn fact, Marvel Games vice president and creative director Bill Roseman said back in September that it's important that each studios' Marvel game is not connected to the rest as it allows for narrative freedom said studio might not get otherwise.\nThis is one area DC could differ greatly from Marvel and who knows, perhaps it's the creative edge DC needs to catch up to the MCU. Only time will tell. \nIn the meantime, check out our thoughts on the latest DC game in Game Informer's Gotham Knights review. Read our list of the top 10 superhero games of all time after that. \nDo you like the idea of games connecting to the DCU or do you prefer Marvel's approach to video games?

Despite Red Dead Redemption’s best efforts, I’ve always felt there’s a shortage of wild wests in video games, although some games use a western’s formula to tell a story set elsewhere. Evil West’s premise also feels reminiscent of something you’d see in the PlayStation 2 era: cowboys who protect mere mortals from the secret horrors of the world, such as vampires and other creatures. My mind can’t help but see Darkwatch, a game I played repeatedly as a child, when I see Evil West. \nEven more generally, that era was great for third-person action westerns – Gun, Red Dead Revolver, the aforementioned Darkwatch, and Call of Juarez (althou…",

I am talking about Ratatoskr, the eyepatch-wearing squirrel who watches over Yggdrasil, the world tree that holds the realms in place.\nRatatoskr technically appeared in God of War (2018), but he was less of a character and more of an ability.

According to designer and creative director Ben Esposito, the earliest iteration was in March 2019, more than three years before its release in June 2022. In that time, there were more than 50 different iterations. Sometimes changes were small. Other times they fundamentally altered the level. Every designer who worked on the game has touched Smackdown in some form. Nevertheless, load into it now; chances are all that labor is invisible to you. Before sitting down to write, I beat it in just 11 seconds.\nNeon White is a game built around speedrunning. Levels are short. If you’re playing as intended, you hardly notice your surroundings before moving on. But the only way that works effectively is if levels are meticulously designed to facilitate that movement; they have to be made so that it feels natural for the player to fly through them. Making a level you barely think twice about takes a lot of effort. Read more...",

The number, which includes physical and downloadable copies as reported by Nintendo, already places Pokémon Scarlet and Violet in the top 15 best-selling Nintendo Switch titles of all time. In this three-day number, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet have already outpaced lifetime sales of games such as Splatoon 3, Kirby and the Forgotten Land, Nintendo Switch Sports, and Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury.\nThe current overall best-selling Nintendo Switch title is Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, which has sold just over 48 million units as of the end of September. As of this writing, the Pokémon franchise occupies 3 of the top 10 slots of lifetime Nintendo Switch software sales, with Let's Go, Pikachu and Eevee at number 10, Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl at number 8, and Sword and Shield at number 5. Pokémon Scarlet and Violet need to sell just under 5 million more combined copies to crack into the top 10. To date, the Nintendo Switch has sold over 114 million units.\nPokémon Scarlet and Violet represent the first time players are able to explore a fully open-world environment in a mainline Pokémon RPG. While critics praised various aspects of the newest games in the series, the technical performance has been universally panned. However, despite those concerns, Game Freak, The Pokémon Company, and Nintendo clearly have another massive hit on their hands. You can read our full review of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet here.",

Halo, one of the biggest video game franchises ever created, is about an ongoing war with aliens.

Street Fighter 6 is no different in this regard. Amid the new additions like Kimberly, Jamie, and Luke, longtime players can find comfort in the presence of fighters like Ryu, Chun-Li, Guile, and Ken appearing as well. However, even those returning fighters have some changes to their looks, outfits, and personalities for this sixth mainline entry.\nDuring our trip to Osaka, Japan, where we visited Capcom's headquarters, we sat down with Street Fighter 6 art director Kaname Fujioka to learn more about his time at Capcom. \"The biggest inspiration for me wanting to join Capcom and work on fighting games was Street Fighter II,\" he says. \"I w…",

          "description": "A new Fire Emblem Engage trailer has detailed how players can summon \"Emblems,\" characters from past Fire Emblem games. Units will be able to equip Engage Rings to gain the ability to gain the power of a hero, like Marth or Byleth. When units equip the rings, they become synced with the Emblems, boosting their stats and giving them access to new, Emblem-specific skills. Based on the demonstration in the trailer, this will make a massive difference in a unit’s power level.\n\n\nUnits can also “Engage” with the Emblems, fusing into a new form even more powerful than a synced form. In addition to gaining access to special weapons, the player can use Engage Skills: unique abilities that harken back to the Emblems’ original games. For example, since Byleth was a teacher in Fire Emblem: Three Houses, one of his abilities allows him to teach nearby units, boosting their stats. Meanwhile, Corrin can use an ability called Dragon Vein, which alters the terrain in the same way she was able to in Fire Emblem Fates.\nIn total, the trailer showed off six Emblems: Marth (Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon), Sigurd (Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War), Celica (Fire Emblem Gaiden/Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia), Lyn (Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade), Corrin (Fire Emblem Fates), and Byleth (Fire Emblem: Three Houses). Additionally, a trailer from last week features glimpses of Ike and Lucina, and then mentions 12 rings, implying that Engage will feature more Emblems at launch.\nFire Emblem Engage was announced at a Nintendo Direct back in September. The initial trailer revealed that Alear, the game’s protagonist, is the Divine Dragon, a descendant of a royal family of Dragons that defeated the Fell Dragon many years ago. We’ll know the full story and more when the game launches on January 20, 2023.",

          "description": "Legendary Sonic designer and Balan Wonderworld director Yuji Naka has been arrested in Tokyo in connection to an insider trading investigation involving the reveal of a Dragon Quest game. \nAccording to the Japanese news outlet FNN, the last 24 hours saw ex-Square Enix employee Taisuke Sazaki and his friend Fumiaki Suzuki arrested on suspicion for insider trading. In 2020, developer Aiming had been set to announce its mobile game Dragon Quest Tact, and Sazaki and Suzuki are alleged to have known details about the game before it was publicly revealed. The pair reportedly purchased a combined 162,000 shares of Aiming for roughly 47.2 million yen (or over $335,000) in advance with the intent of profiting on a potentially higher stock price stemming from Tact’s announcement. \nYuji Naka is now suspected of being involved in this scandal as well. He is accused of purchasing 10,000 shares worth 2.8 million yen (roughly $20,000) in Aiming for the same purpose of profiting from Tact’s reveal. Naka was apprehended by Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office, and the investigation is ongoing. It’s currently unknown if the suspects still own their shares or if they already sold them.  \nThis is the second major controversy Naka has found himself involved with this year. In April, Naka publicly blasted Square Enix on Twitter over his removal as director from Balan Wonderworld prior to its release, blaming Square for the game’s critical failure. This outburst came after the conclusion of a lawsuit he’d previously filed against the publisher. Naka is best known as the lead programmer behind the original Sonic the Hedgehog games for Sega Genesis and Nights into Dreams. \n[Source: FNN]",

The video revealed some details on the project’s status as well as some early images. \n\n\nThe Splinter Cell remake was first announced last December, but we’ve known very little about it other than it’s being rebuilt from scratch in Snowdrop Engine (used to make The Division, Mario + Rabbids games). In the video, the team states the experience will be identical to the 2002 title but it wants to implement improvements and features introduced in later Splinter Cell titles as well as smooth some rough edges. For example, the team wants to give players more opportunities to de-escalate situations when things go awry instead of getting an instant Game Over. \nThe dev team also shares that the project is still in the early prototyping phase. As such, the studio will be going dark “for a while” to focus on making the game, so it will likely be a good while before we hear anything substantial about the remake again. In the meantime, you can take a look at the gallery of new concept images shared during the presentation below. \n\nSplinter Cell doesn’t have a release window or announced platforms. This remake is only one of many on the horizon, and you can keep up with all of them by checking our big list of upcoming video game remakes.",

And now, due to Saints Row failing to meet the full expectations of Embracer Group, developer Volition will become part of Gearbox Entertainment. \nThis news comes by way of Video Games Chronicle, which reports that Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors discussed this transition in a statement released alongside the company's second-quarter earning results. \n\n\n\"The reception of Saints Row did not meet the full expectations and left the fanbase partially polarized,\" Wingefores said in the statement. \"The game development studio, Volition, has been working hard to improve the player experience. Financially, Saints Row has performed in line with management expectations in the quarter. Going forward, Volition will transition to become part of Gearbox which has all the tools, including an experienced management team in the US, to create future success at Volition.\"\nWingefors notes that this is the first time the company has performed an \"internal group transfer where we transfer a major studio between operative groups,\" but says that \"it is not necessarily the last.\" \nSaints Row currently sits at 61 on Metacritic (for the PlayStation 5 version), with a user score of 2.1. Game Informer gave the game an 8.5 out of 10 in its review and you can read what we liked about Saints Row here. \n[Source: Video Games Chronicle]\nDid you play Saints Row?

New features since beta1 include: Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. A new Generate World menu which now includes NewGRF, AI, and Game Script configuration menus. Cargo filters for vehicle lists (such as at stations) to allow better visualization of traffic. Optional cargo names above vehicles in vehicle lists, to show at a glance what they carry. The ability to clone or share orders with vehicles grouped by shared orders. An improved local authority action window which now shows you actions you can’t afford, instead of hiding them. In addition, some new tools are available to AI and Game Script authors: Scriptable league tables which can replace the default scoring system AI and Game Scripts can now be modified in Scenario Editor for existing scenarios (although not savegames) (As ever, see the changelog for further details).
