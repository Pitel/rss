Three Hopes tops out at 810p when docked, with portable mode slicing this down to around 540p and topping out at 648p. Digital Foundry highlights particularly poor anti-aliasing and texture filtering, exacerbated by the thin black outlines around each character. On the flip side, the superior anti-aliasing seen in Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity meant that its frame rate frequently dropped well below 30.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The main character, Ryuki, tends to make loud and passionate references to anime characters while looking for the culprit behind the Half Body killings, assisted by his AI companion Tama, who also happens to occupy Ryuki’s left eye socket.

I have now played through a small bit of the game, a slightly extended version of the area I saw in the hands off preview, and my analysis is... largely the same.\nI know that's very boring, but it's also positive, isn't it? Oxenfree was good, and Oxenfree II looks to be doing those same things that made Oxenfree good. A 2D, side-on supernatural thriller with radios. Good thing remains good! In a world where sequels to beloved media seem to only get progressively worse, I'll happily take it (especially since this one is a Netflix-published project now). And although it's directly related to the first game, the characters and happenings in Oxenfree II are distinct enough that it's going to be accessible if you're new to the series. And even if you did play the first game, it's possible that Oxenfree II will be more thrilling and unsettling to you now, five years later.\nRead more",

This would involve, as they always do, a bunch of benchmark tests: repeatable runs through a specific area or sequence that would give an accurate indication of how different settings and hardware affect performance. In most games these are either quick and easy or time-consuming and easy, but not The Cycle: Frontier. Oh no.\r\n\n\r\nSee, without a dedicated benchmarking tool, running these kinds of tests requires a certain controllable environment, where variables are known and parameters can be reset in a click. This is not the case for The Cycle: Frontier, whose environment is usually trying to fucking kill you, particularly though the unavoidable presence of other players. I’ve never sat down to record some average FPS values only to spend half my time cowering behind a tree, fearful of being shot, robbed and – worst of all – forced to start work over again.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It’s perdition with extra steps, then, but is it any fun? Dear reader, Neon White kicks ass.\nThe game opens with an extremely anime narrative sequence and we’re introduced to the lovable (and less so) doofuses we’ll be shooting up paradise with. This is where most folks will stop and squee at the fact that player character Neon White is voiced by the incomparable Steve Blum, perhaps known best for his role as sonorous space cowboy Spike Spiegel in Cowboy Bebop.

Cue a heady mix of confusion and perturbation – surely Intel weren’t suggesting that Arc GPUs would only function when paired with an Intel CPU, and a relatively new one at that?\r\n\n\r\nNo, they weren’t, though the guide’s vague wording isn’t doing it – and worse, potential Arc users – any favours. Parts of the guide appear to conflate support for Resizable BAR with support for the Arc A-series in general, which further muddies things as Resizable BAR works on AMD Ryzen chips as well as those three Core CPU generations. I asked Intel directly for clarification and essentially, Arc GPUs won’t have such super specific CPU requirements just to run - though they’ll apparently perform better in systems that do support Resizable BAR.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I remembered seeing one particular demo on Steam which made my ears prick up and my eyes expand to thrice their usual size, and until now I hadn't the time to try it out. So today I carved out a small portion of the day to download and play the demo for Dome Keeper, a wave-based survival game about protecting your glass dome home from alien invaders using a gigantic laser.\nUnfortunately, I ended up playing it a little too long, and now I've left myself no time at all to write about why it was so great. Argh. Let me try anyway.\nRead more",

There were some demos I was meant to play for, like, actual work, and then I ran into a puzzle wall or a bug or something so I just fired up Necrosmith again.\nNecrosmith is a 2D necromance 'em up that is also sort of a tower defence game. In the middle of the map is your evil lair, the Hall Of Bones, a sort of legally distinct Sauron's tower that gets more flying buttresses the more you upgrade it. If enemies (which can be packs of wolves or flying bugs or all manner of things) do enough damage to destroy it, you lose - so that's your defense bit. For the towers bit, you have to imagine that the towers can move on their own, and also that they're shambling undead monsters made from a jigsaw of different limbs you find, like an army of very unhygenic Mr Potato Heads.\nRead more",

Indeed, \"based on the volume of reports, the amount of misconduct reflected is comparatively low for a company the size of Activision Blizzard.\" You can read the SEC filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in full here.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The RTS potential for an interplanetary ground war against overwhelming swarms of giant not-insects is obvious enough. But the dual spirit of most Paul Verhoeven films is a major reason that The Extraordinary Lust Of Dizzy (working title: Starship Troopers) still holds up 25 years on.\n\r\n\r\nTerran Command understands that. Certainly it nods to the satire here and there, but mostly it focuses on the shooting and desperate defences and evacuations instead. This was the right decision. Though it's a little short on narrative flavour, unless you're really into exploring the setting, it's got enough tactical heft to make up for it.\r\n\r\n \nRead more",

In fact in the presentation the game was referred to as a \"farmadventure\", which isn't a portmanteau and you only have to go another centimetere along to get farmventure, which is just about a portmanteau and, furthermore, is fun to say. \nDevelopers Frame Break are keen to emphasise how chilled out Lightyear Frontier is: it's very peaceful, and there's no death (a \"survival game without survival\"). It's all about ecology and being one with nature. This does, at times, feel slightly at odds with the other eye-catching thing about Lightyear Frontier, which is a bloody massive tractor mech stomping about everywhere. \nRead more",

He’s one of the more memorable characters you meet in Tendershoot’s alternate reality web simulator, an angsty teenage boy whose home page is slathered in camouflage textures and GIFS of exploding handguns. Since release, Zane has become one of Hypnospace’s de facto mascots, a beloved dweeb that is abrasive but also kind of painfully relatable? It’s hard to laugh at Zane’s baggy trousers and love for Linkin Park-esque rap-metal when you grew up in the mid-2000’s. I mean, we all bought a dog lead from Wilkinson’s and hooked it between the belt loops on our jeans at one point, right? …right?\n\n\nAhem. Anyway. Announced earlier this year alongside Dreamsettler (a proper sequel to Hypnospace), Slayers X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengance of the Slayer is an FPS spin-off that stars the fan-favourite teen. Slayers X is framed as being an in-universe project that Zane worked on as a teen, and has been uncovered by his now 37-year-old self, who is determined to finally see it released. There’s a short demo available as part of Steam’s most recent Next Fest, and I’m delighted to say it’s exactly what I hoped it would be.\r\n\n \nRead more",

And, sure enough, we actually got a pretty big eyeful of it.\nNow, keep in mind that this game is set in outer space, the vast expanse and wonders of which we cannot ken. You could do any cool, awe-inspiring thing you want with space. Crystal waterfalls that flow backwards into the sky. Aurora borealis-like lights but so low down they whip along at ground level. Deserts of hot-pink dust sprouting deep blue rock spires. Destiny 2 has some cool planets, for example. Imagine my confusion, then, when the footage of Bethesda's brand new IP made it look like they've accidentally done Fallout or Elder Scrolls again.\nRead more",

Nivalis is a slice-of-life sim set in the same cyberpunk city as hovercar courier game Cloudpunk, where we'll get to run bars and restaurants, grow ingredients, fish, make friends, and maybe even find love.

Everyone knows that the true heart of any RPG is the character creation screen though. It’s just science. Speaking of which, Starfield’s character creation menus are modelling themselves on some real-life science, namely molecular biology. That’s cool, I think.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Among the updates are several that help with the bot problem in Team Fortress 2; users can no longer change names during a matchmaking game, for example.

          "description": "Saving Moonbury one potion at a time\nThe day I'll be tired of life simulators will be the day that I die, which is why I'm so excited to see another great game in the genre finally get a release date. Potion Permit is an adorable little life sim, and if you haven't seen it yet, you're in for a treat (you can also play the PC demo right now, by the way). The game is set in the small town of Moonbury, where an illness has spread. As the Medical Association's most skilled potion maker, the player is tasked with helping create the cure for the ailing townsfolk.\nLet's be honest, all of these games have a super cute art style, but I have to say Potion Permit has one of my favorite looks from a game like this in a long time. Plus, everything looks super polished, which is a huge plus going in. From the trailer, I can already get the sense too that we won't be in want of activities to pad out our playtimes.\nhttps://twitter.com/PQubeGames/status/1539579544805548032\nThere's a ton to do in Moonbury — aside from diagnosing patients, finding ingredients for potions, and of course healing them, players can get to know over thirty of the town's inhabitants, fight off fearsome creatures, and upgrade the town and the surrounding areas. There are some RPG elements too, but we haven't gotten a good look at what those might be just yet.\nOf everything Potion Permit has to offer, I think I'm probably most excited for all of the NPCs in the game. That's just around the number of NPCs you can give gifts to in Stardew Valley, and I don't want to play the comparison game too much here, but that always felt around just the right amount to me. Having a whole new cast of characters to befriend (and romance) in games like these is always a highlight for me, and I already have an NPC or two that I have my eyes on.\nPotion Permit will be available on PS4, PS5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, and Steam on September 22, 2022.\nThe post Life sim Potion Permit brews up a fall release date appeared first on Destructoid.",

The kings of the black-and-green brand spoke about its hardware troubles in a recent statement to gaming outlet VGC, who had noticed a lack of stock online and in the high street.\n\"We know it may be hard finding Xbox Wireless Controllers right now due to supply disruptions,\" a Microsoft spokesperson told VGC. \"We’re working as fast as possible with our manufacturing and retail partners to improve this. Please check with your local retailer for availability.\"\nThe shortages appear to be most apparent in the UK and Europe, though North American territories are likely to follow suit if Microsoft is unable to ramp up production. According to ResetEra users, stores in Australia and The Netherlands are also struggling to keep their stock cupboards plentiful. Both standard controllers and Xbox's cool custom \"Design Lab\" models are affected.\nHardware and accessory shortages have continued to trouble the industry since the COVID-19 pandemic affected production and distribution cycles worldwide. From consoles to graphics cards to controllers, publishers are struggling to produce their wares with the speed and regularity of previous generations. It is a problem expected to continue into 2023 at the very least.\nMicrosoft has confirmed a shortage of Xbox controllers [VGC]\nThe post ‘Supply disruptions’ result in shortage of Xbox controllers appeared first on Destructoid.",

XSEED and Marvelous confirm today that Rune Factory 5 is getting a PC port on July 13.\nThe latest entry in the Rune Factory series launched earlier this year as a Nintendo Switch exclusive. The Steam version looks to be a similar offering. It's $59.99 for the standard edition (though it's currently on a pre-launch 15% discount) or $69.99 for the Digital Deluxe, which includes the Rune Factory 4 marriage candidates outfit set. Any pre-order also nets two cosmetic outfits and a New Ranger Care Package of items in-game.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Edy6Bx_G8\nFarming up a storm\nIf you're new to Rune Factory, it runs in a similar vein to Harvest Moon and Stardew Valley. The key difference is that Rune Factory puts a bit more of a focus on combat and exploring dungeons than the actual farming.\nDepending on what you're looking for, that can be a positive or negative. In our review of the Switch launch, Rune Factory 5 seemed to be playing the hits, while not necessarily winning over new hearts thanks to falling into some familiar pitfalls. Things can get repetitive and basic at times too.\nWhat a PC port might offer is a performance boost, which some might welcome. All-in-all, I was a big fan of Rune Factory 4 but stayed away from the next entry after hearing some early impressions of it. I'm hopeful the Steam version gives it enough of a boost to put it back on my radar.\nRune Factory 5 launches for PC via Steam on July 13, 2022.\nThe post Rune Factory 5 is coming to PC on July 13 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Who are you going to call?\nIndie publisher Digerati has announced that DreadOut 2, the sequel to cult streaming favorite DreadOut, will be bringing its ghostly goings-on to PlayStation and Xbox platforms in July, following on from its initial release on PC way back in 2020.\nhttps://youtu.be/EjkwgcI5hNI\nDreadOut 2, much like the 2014 original, is a scare-heavy survival horror title developed by studio Digital Happiness. A third-person action-adventure, DreadOut 2 tells the tale of hardy schoolgirl \"Linda Meillinda,\" (holy shit), who must use her psychic ghost-whispering powers to uncover and banish an army of spooky spirits that are haunting her town. Much like the popular Fatal Frame series, Linda is aided in her efforts by her camera... though the Camera Obscura here is replaced by... a smartphone.\nExplore Ms. Mellinda's hometown, speak to members of both the living and the dead, take on an array of side-quests, venture into dark, desolate, and disquieting corners, or just take a literal hammer to the bonce of the undead. Keep your proton pack, Spengler. DreadOut 2 expands upon the original game with a tighter focus on both exploration and combat, but is still jam-packed with terrifying monstrosities and more than a fistful of jump scares. While it's no Resident Evil, it will certainly fit the bill for those looking for a few ghoulish scenarios on a tired evening.\nDreadOut 2 launches July 15 on Xbox platforms, with PlayStation to follow on July 20, priced at around $20. It is available to purchase right now for PC via Steam.\nThe post Cult horror sequel DreadOut 2 coming to PlayStation and Xbox in July appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The Silver Fox\nSurprise! Turns out that Nexon is still not done revealing characters for its upcoming fighter DNF Duel, which is literally less than six days away from launch. Today's DNF Duel trailer introduces us to the Lost Warrior, who carries with him the undeniable presence and physical aura of a potential boss character.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqaHE0JwIJ8\nThe Lost Warrior, as you can see in the video above, carries himself with the visual appearance of primordial times, but with a fighting style and mastery of magic beyond his years, suggesting that he may be capable of visiting multiple worlds and eras. Lost Warrior commands the battleground with devastating large strikes, reminiscent of King of Fighters' Rugal. The silver fox is also capable of switching positions with his opponent and rounds off the battle by repeatedly slamming his foe into handy nearby mountains. Ouch.\nLost Warrior is, officially, the final character to join the DNF Duel launch roster, which now totals 16 distinct and unique fighters. I'm still pretty much at a loss for who I'm gonna be digging into, but Enchantress and Inquisitor are both pretty solid calls for me. I hope to share my findings on Nexon's underdog fighter with you all soon. In the meantime, maybe check out the previous trailers for Berserker, Grappler, Hitman, Inquisitor, Striker, Ranger, Dragon Knight, Vanguard, Kunoichi, Crusader, Ghostblade, Launcher, Troubleshooter, Swift Master, and Enchantress.\nDNF Duel launches on PlayStation and PC platforms June 28.\nThe post DNF Duel is STILL revealing new characters, here is the Lost Warrior appeared first on Destructoid.",

Old pop culture collectibles have become priceless artifacts in this world, so the goal is to plunder more memorabilia than the other crews and get them out.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0694XcFmI7M\nIt looks like Hyenas is really leaning into the pop culture and \"irreverent\" tone, as creative director Charlie Bewsher describes in a post-premiere interview. Zero-G movement and combat also look to play a factor. Each playable Hyena also has unique abilities, to cater to whatever playstyle you'd want.\nScraps of nostalgia\nHyenas really looks to be another entry in the Tarkov-influenced extraction shooter genre. We've seen plenty of these, from Rainbow Six Extraction to Battlefield 2042's Hazard Zone.\nWhat seems to be setting Hyenas apart is the tone itself. It's taking a bright and brazen approach that feels right in line with the likes of Borderlands. That, plus hoards full of nostalgic loot and references, like the Nixon mask and a Rubik's Cube.\nCreative Assembly has made some stellar games, including Alien: Isolation and the Total War games, but I can't really say I'm sold on Hyenas just yet. It will have a chance to prove itself ahead of its 2023 launch though. Sign-ups for the Alpha Test are live right now over on the game's website.\nOtherwise, Hyenas is aiming to launch in 2023 for PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, and PS5.\nThe post Hyenas is Sega’s new pop culture-infused sci-fi FPS appeared first on Destructoid.",

(A demo is already available on PlayStation platforms.)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ7XL0ksQLY\nAs a quick refresher, Yurukill: The Calumniation Games is an unnerving new release that sees convicted felons forced to team up with their victims in order to survive a bizarre tournament of death — presided over by \"Binko,\" an attractive woman in a sinister fox mask. Yurukill hopes to marry the fast-paced, pulse-pounding action of a G.rev-developed shmup with the heavy social deduction drama of a Danganronpa, all bedecked in attractive anime artwork and, of course, starring a cast of ridiculously hot hipsters. The story has been written by Homura Kawamoto of Kakegurui fame, so expect plenty of high drama and state-smashing anarchy.\nThe Steam demo will offer players the first chapter of Yurukill in its entirety, which will certainly give you a taste of the title's mood, atmosphere, and genre-blending gameplay. I've been hugely intrigued by this title ever since its initial announcement, so I'm definitely hoping to get to this demo later today to check out the action for myself. Oh, and should you pull the trigger on a full purchase, then your demo save data will be carried over into the main release.\nYurukill: The Calumniation Games launches in North America, July 5, on PlayStation, PC, and Nintendo Switch.\nThe post You can now check out Yurukill: The Calumniation Games on PC via Steam demo appeared first on Destructoid.",

With the sequel coming into focus and trying its best to justify itself (now as a free-to-play, battle-pass-powered game), the long-time-coming tank hero has stepped \"out of the lore and into the light,\" as Blizzard puts it.\n\"Tanks play more aggressively in Overwatch 2,\" and as one of the first new characters for the game's Season 1 launch, Junker Queen has to exemplify that shift.

          "description": "Big enough for the whole Bat Family\nWB Montreal's Gotham Knights is sounding like a pretty big game. Or at least big in square mileage, when it comes to the city of Gotham.\nIn an interview with Game Informer, Gotham Knights game director Geoff Ellenor emphasizes the Batcycle's usefulness for getting around Gotham.\n\"It's pretty big. I haven’t put one map over the other, but our Gotham is a big place. I tend to spend a lot of my Zoom calls on the Batcyle driving around Gotham. It is one of the fastest and most chill ways to move around the city. It feels like a big place.\"\nGotham Knights executive producer Fleur Marty follows it up with a more direct comparison to how big this portrayal of Batman's home will be.\n\"For sure it’s the biggest version of Gotham that has been represented in video games,\" said Fleur. \"The most important thing for us is its density and verticality. It has a lot of layers. The Batcycle is the long-range mode of transportation.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFtYcS3DPfM\nKnight court\nThat's a big Gotham then, if we're comparing it to the likes of Arkham Knight. Good to know the Batfamily may have lost Bruce but kept some wheels around.\nAs for other tidbits from Game Informer's coverage, the pair also addresses what happens when two players pick the same character. It sounds like it's not only possible, but has some funny ramifications.\n\"We’re leaving it up to players.,\" said Fleur. \"We know some people will want to have different characters, but some won’t care. I don’t want to spoil anything, but there’s a funny moment in the game if you are playing as two of the same character.\"\nI'm hoping for a \"two Robins walk into a bar\" joke somewhere. Gotham Knights is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on Oct. 25, 2022.\nThe post Gotham Knights will have ‘biggest’ Gotham in a video game thus far appeared first on Destructoid.",

Four more characters from the manga and anime series are dropping into Fortnite's Item Shop on June 23, this Thursday.\nThe four candidates chosen this time around are some recognizable faces, even if you're not too familiar with Naruto. Itachi Uchiha and Orochimaru bring some menacing presence to the field, while Gaara is the rival-turned-ally of the group. Also joining the crew is Hinata, a Hyuga clan Shinobi who grows close to the cast, especially Naruto.\nAdd these to the already added Naruto characters in Fortnite, like Sasuke and the titular shinobi, and you've got a lot of options for fans of the ninja-themed series.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7xNgjFqdw\nAlongside the skins themselves, there are also a bunch of backpacks, gliders, and emotes to pick up as part of this \"Rivals\" drop. There are bundles too, packing together some of the characters, cosmetics, and some loading screens as well. You can find the full rundown here.\nReturn to the village\nAdditionally, from 8 p.m. ET on June 23 to 8 p.m. ET on July 7, the gates to the Hidden Leaf Village Map will open up again. The adventure area has plenty of locations to explore, as well as quests to complete and unlock more areas. Nindo Community Challenges are also back, oepning up today to earn some cosmetic rewards.\nNow, I'm not the biggest Naruto fan, so these admittedly do little for me. But if I may still make a humble request: if we're going to keep adding Naruto characters to Fortnite, Rock Lee needs to be in the picture.\nThe post More Naruto skins are coming to Fortnite this week appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Art exhibition coming to Tokyo this summer\nThis year sees the 20th anniversary of the cult JRPG franchise .hack//. To celebrate two decades of dystopian sci-fi action, publisher Bandai Namco has announced several different endeavors that will look back at the video games, manga, anime, and novels set within CyberConnect2's new millennium.\nThe original run of the .hack manga has been digitally republished and is available for Japanese fans to purchase between now and July 4 directly from the CyberConnect2 website. In addition, a special anniversary book will launch on July 19, looking back at every release in the series — from the original  2002 PS2 release .hack//Infection through collectible card title .hack//Enemy. Unfortunately, Bandai Namco did not announce any plans to localize these re-releases for western fans.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ulUhubUdYc\nA special exhibition will also be installed at Yurakucho Marui in Chiyoda, Tokyo between the dates of August 9 and August 28, 2022. The installation will feature original concept artwork and other audio/visual elements celebrating the multimedia franchise. In December, a second commemorative anniversary book will also be released, alongside a special three-CD set of .hack's evocative and melodramatic score.\nBut what in the way of new games? Well, Bandai Namco has not offered any such reveal, or even the announcement of a reveal, but mystery still surrounds the \"Last Recollection\" trademark, which the publisher filed back in April of this year. It is believed that this pertains to an as-yet-unannounced set of the four mainline titles in the .hack franchise, namely .hack//Infection, .hack//Mutation, .hack//Outbreak, and finally .hack//Quarantine. So just sit tight for new news, hack squad.\nThe post Bandai Namco celebrates .hack 20th anniversary with retrospective video appeared first on Destructoid.",

I know I am, just for the roster at the very least. The publisher has chosen to stoke the hype fire one last time by releasing the game's opening cinematic.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruRh8RGLRVM\nOriginally announced in 2019, (and widely covered by yer boy since), DNF Duel is a one-on-one fighter adapted from the popular Korean MMO Dungeon Fighter Online. DNF Duel repurposes an arsenal of DFO classes as individual roster members, including Fighter, Grappler, Inquisitor, Dragon Knight, Kunoichi, and many others. With gameplay designed by Guilty Gear's Arc System Works, and some very impressive visuals, DNF Duel is looking to make an impact in the coming FGC summer season.\nDNF Duel will feature rollback netcode on PS4 and PC, though will sadly not support crossplay, at least not at launch. In addition to online battles, the fighter will include a single-player story mode, training facilities, survival mode, a gallery, and more. There is no denying that it is an unknown IP in the fighting game world, and is up against stiff competition from current and upcoming games. But it looks like Nexon's underdog hopes to come out swingin' and carve a niche all of its very own.\nDNF Duel will launch on PlayStation and PC platforms June 28. Be sure to check out the dynamic character trailers for Berserker, Grappler, Hitman, Inquisitor, Striker, Ranger, Dragon Knight, Vanguard, Kunoichi, Crusader, Ghostblade, Launcher, Troubleshooter, Swift Master, and Enchantress.\nThe post DNF Duel previews opening cinematic one week from launch appeared first on Destructoid.",

The Free For All season is live now, and Fall Guys is officially launched for Nintendo Switch and Xbox consoles.\nNews of this update arrived last month, revealing Mediatonic's gameshow-style competition is coming to new platforms. With today's update, Fall Guys is now free to play on all platforms. It also has cross-play across all platforms, so the party doesn't stop when you swap over. Mediatonic also confirms in an FAQ that the new season makes Fall Guys cross-progression as well.\nhttps://twitter.com/FallGuysGame/status/1539235705460776962\nToday's update also marks the launch of the new Season Pass. Everyone gets access to 50 levels, while legacy players—those who bought Fall Guys when it first launched—get the whole thing free.\nGrab a hold of the ledge\nSome more updates are in store for Fall Guys today as well. Alongside the new cosmetics in the Season Pass, some new courses are being added. Hex-A-Ring, Volleyfall, Speed Circuit, Track Attack, Bounce Party, The Swiveller, and Blast Ball are all added in to the game.\nAn Auto Grab option is also available, letting players automatically grab ledges. You can also now dive-grab Tails and Crowns, which is sure to make some of those protect-your-tail rounds more interesting. Voice Chat is also enabled in Parties.\nOne note is that while Steam owners will continue to be able to play Fall Guys and get all the updates, the platformer royale won't have a Steam store page anymore. Any new players picking up Fall Guys on PC today will need to play through the Epic Games Store.\nWith all the new cosmetics and courses, as well as cross-platform play, it really does seem like a good summer to get back into Fall Guys.

That's this week!\nOriginally released on March 25, 2022, Tiny Tina's Wonderlands came out on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and...PC, but only on the Epic Games Store. While many games have longer exclusivity windows, Wonderlands will hit Steam in less than three months, which isn't bad in the grand scheme of things. Gearbox has announced that the exact release time for Wonderlands Steam is actually 10AM PT on June 23. It'll debut with a standard edition for $60, or the special [Chaotic Great] edition for $79.99 (which includes the season pass) — if you buy in on Steam through July 7, 2022, you'll get the golden hero armor pack.\nSo, a few quick things about the Wonderlands Steam edition. Gearbox says that save data can be transferred between Steam and Epic, \"but will need to be moved manually.\" Annoyingly, the publisher says that \"players run the risk of potentially losing save files,\" and suggests that users \"make a backup copy.\" This kind of goes without saying, but it's good to reiterate every now and then. The Steam version will also support cross-play, and will not be left out of that party. Oh, and the Molten Mirrors DLC is out this week, which will be live alongside of the Steam edition. It's the third (of four) \"Mirrors of Mystery\" DLC packs, which comprise the season pass.\nYou can find the Steam page for the game here. Again, it'll be live on June 23 at 10AM PT.\nThe post Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands only took three months to come to Steam, no longer an Epic exclusive appeared first on Destructoid.",

The mod itself is a work in progress, as is the custom game mode concept, but for now, the basics seem to be working.\nInterestingly, moon collection (collectibles that dictate game progress) \"is shared between all players.\" Meaning, you could have an entire crew jump into a level, and either play it separately to divide and conquer, or hang out together and go for the same objective. It reminds me of Castlevania: Harmony of Despair's core gimmick (man that game needs to come back on modern platforms!).\nWhile Mario Odyssey felt more than complete on its own, something like this, even if it was just a few players at a time, gives it new life. \"What if [X] had multiplayer\" is something people have been pondering for decades in the realm of gaming, and mods have typically been the way to deliver on that dream.\nSuper Mario Odyssey multiplayer trailer:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXxnhvP_LEI\nThe post Someone made a Super Mario Odyssey multiplayer mod appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Legendary studio has something in store\nTreasure, the acclaimed studio behind such franchises as Gunstar Heroes, Radiant Silvergun, Bangai-O, and Ikaruga, has announced that it is currently hard at work on a mysterious new game, which it hopes to announce later in 2022 as part of the developer's 30th-anniversary celebrations.\nWhile the studio — which was originally founded in 1992 by ex-Konami coder Masato Maegawa — has offered no direct information in regards to the new game's IP, form, or genre, Treasure has noted that the project is something that its fans have been requesting for quite some time, which has got the company's dedicated, long-time fanbase buzzing with excitement and intrigue.\nhttps://twitter.com/TreasureCoLtd/status/1538446520977985536?s=20&t=9OJMkYLupw94PAZdA8yaxw\n\"On June 19, 2022, Treasure celebrated its 30th anniversary!\" wrote the developer on its official Twitter. \"On this 30th anniversary year, we are working hard in development to announce the highly requested 'that'. Please continue to give Treasure your support going forward.\"\nWhile the tweet makes it sound like the title will be a known entity, such as a sequel or remake, that still leaves a whole lot of mystery up in the air. After all, Treasure's catalog of franchises are all incredibly popular, and fans would be pleased with a sequel to any of the aforementioned games. Of course, we could simply be looking at a major remaster or remake of one of its enduring classics — Ikaruga for example — but frankly, at this stage, I think the fans are just happy to see the studio back at it.\nLet the speculation commence. We'll be sure to give you the good word when Treasure shows its hand.\nThe post Treasure developing ‘highly requested’ new game for its 30th anniversary appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's not one of those let-down \"oh it's coming to Xbox Game Pass, but cloud only\" (cue Microsoft exec laughs) deals either. It's hitting Xbox Game Pass on July 1 on everything: cloud, console, and PC.\nIt's not alone, either. The Shadowrun Trilogy is set to debut on Xbox Game Pass today, on both cloud devices and consoles. It's significant in that it's actually three games: Shadowrun Returns, Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut, and Shadowrun: Hong Kong. The rest of the week is rounded out by Total War: Three Kingdoms, FIFA 22, and Naraka: Bladepoint. As usual, Game Pass is getting down with a degree of variety with its offerings: tactical RPGs, sports, and AAA shooters. Not bad!\nMicrosoft also reminds folks that Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge recently came out on Game Pass, which is perfect for the service for those who are on the fence about a beat 'em up.\nXbox Game Pass week of June 20:\nShadowrun Trilogy, June 21 (Cloud and Console)\nTotal War: Three Kingdoms, June 21 (PC)\nFIFA 22, June 23 (Console and PC)\nNaraka: Bladepoint, June 23 (Cloud, Console, and PC)\nXbox Game Pass week of June 27:\nFar Cry 5, July 1 (Cloud, Console, and PC)\nThe post Far Cry 5 is coming to Xbox Game Pass on July 1 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Atari is among the oldest and most well-known names in the gaming industry, and it’s celebrating its 50th year on June 27. It first established its headquarters in Sunnyvale, California, neighbor to a host of now-famous tech startups. The new logo, a callback to the retro design of the old location, features the company’s classic branding alongside a semi-transparent “50.” Atari is calling the limited-time celebration logo “Borregas” after the street where you could find the headquarters. According to the company, this design will join with the previously revealed “Sunnyvale” anniversary logo in gracing the many upcoming corporate announcements, game reveals, partnerships, and merchandising collaborations.\n “Design innovation was a fundamental driver and differentiator for Atari during the golden age of video games,” said Wade Rosen, CEO of Atari. “Every artist, designer, and engineer challenged themselves to reach creative excellence; it is a hallmark of Atari that persists to this day.”\nIn the midst of the logo’s reveal, it also looks like an Atari classic is getting a revival. According to Gamerbraves, a follow-up to Yar’s Revenge is in the works. The information comes straight from Howard Scott Warshaw, who worked at Atari in the ‘80s and created the title for the Atari 2600. The interview contained few concrete details on the project, just that it seems the sequel has been greenlit. Hopefully, we will hear more about the game as development continues.",

          "description": "Sega's Creative Assembly is working on a brand-new game revealed today: Hyenas. The title is described as a multiplayer, multi-team heist experience set in space with a punky comic book aesthetic. What this means practically is players can jump into five teams of three to battle each other over a prize and \"engage, evade, exploit, and steal their way to victory.\" The game's debut trailer shows off some fast-pasted action, but to see everything for yourself, you can check out the trailer below.\n\n\nThe story envisions a world in which the billionaires have finally made it to mars, destroying Earth in the process. However, the rich get nostalgic for their former planet's culture. So, they send out ships to collect plunder from the remnants of Earth's poor survivors. Not content to take this sitting down, the Hyenas are fighting back.\nThe game is still in early development, so the creators have not revealed the release date, but we do know the game is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Though it's still a ways off, you can sign up for Hyenas' alpha today, and you can learn much more about the title in IGN's Summer of Gaming interview-filled stream.",

But it’s not enough to simply have horrifying monsters and an oppressive atmosphere; developer Striking Distance believes it’s how you arrange these elements. And it does so through a process the team dubs \"horror engineering.\" \nHorror engineering defines the meticulous manner in which the team constructs its scares so they have the maximum effect on players. That ranges from designing a room with strategically placed entry points for the biophage, The Callisto Protocol’s monsters, to pop out, to obsessing over details as small as whether a light bulb should flicker two times or three.

The fancy edition also comes with (sigh) the Butt Stallion cosmetic pack and the four Mirrors of Mystery DLCs. The editions are available for $59.99 and $79.99 USD, respectively. \nAcross all platforms, the Molten Mirrors (the third of the Mirrors of Mystery DLC) is also being released on June 23. As detailed by Gearbox: \nThe last Mirrors of Mystery DLC is expected to be released later this year for owners of the Season Pass or Chaotic Great Edition. It will add a new playable class. \"This shamanic elementalist channels spirits and summons storms to wear down foes with poison and elemental damage,\" Gearbox said in a press release.\nAccording to our reviewer, Tiny Tina's Wonderland is really good.

Whatever. But there's more to it than PlayStation's ever-growing list of really expensive games.\nI had little-to-no interest in the new PlayStation Plus when it was announced. But when Sony gave me three free months – the perks of being in the press, I guess, but also something I should disclose given the glowing nature of this piece – I took the time to scroll through the games list. \nTo my delight, it's full of weirdo games you probably haven't heard of and definitely have not played. Immediately, I downloaded nearly a dozen games based solely on the criteria of \"Does this look weird and/or interesting?\" It's been a blast. \nI finally played through the Gravity Rush series, and while I think Gravity Rush 2 is disappointing, the original is fantastic. I highly recommend checking it out. It takes about seven hours to mainline and consistently keeps mission design interesting. It's also a ton of fun throwing yourself around its dizzying open world. \nI also played Mitsurugi Kamui hikae. It's an objectively bad game but I can't help but love it. You play as a girl with a big sword, going after your friend who is also a girl with a big sword – but she's evil. You load into bland combat arenas that look ripped straight out of a PlayStation 2 game and fight enemies that all look the same. Again, it's bad. But charmingly, in a way I appreciate. I played for an hour and loved every second.\nNext up are Disaster Report 4, Tokyo Jungle, and the Siren series. I can't wait. But I want to know, what hidden gems have you found on PlayStation Plus? Keep it weird, unique, and interesting. If you're finally checking out Red Dead Redemption II, keep it to yourself. We all know that's a great game.

          "description": "The Callisto Protocol captured the attention of horror fans worldwide with its terrifying world and oppressive sense of horror, but how does it feel to play it? In this exclusive Game Informer interview, Ben Walker, design director at Striking Distance Studios, breaks down how combat, dodging, and the bounty of gameplay systems work.\n\n\nJoin Alex Stadnik and Marcus Stewart as they grill Ben on all things Callisto gameplay. The trio kicks off the conversation by dissecting the basics of combat. In Callisto, players balance melee and ranged encounters to keep protagonist Jacob alive as he fights through Saturn's dead moon. At your side is your trusty shiv, a shock baton, and a wide swath of weapons to fend off the Biophage and figure out what's happening on the moon.\nWhile that may seem like a pretty standard setup, the key is how players balance their approach to enemy encounters. Callisto is not a game that will overpower players. Jacob has limited ammo and health and can't go in guns blazing if he hopes to survive. Those who delve into the fray will also have to utilize the new dodging system Striking Distance emphasizes as a massive part of combat. Instead of a simple button press, you'll have to use the left stick to dodge either left or right at the precise moment. Blocking works too, but it will always cost you a bit of health. Callisto has a lot going on moment to moment, but Striking Distance hopes this dance leads to a thrilling moment-to-moment experience.\nIf that's not enough, we also discuss how the team utilizes the PlayStation 5 controller to up the immersion, upgrade trees, and much more.\nIf you want to learn more about The Callisto Protocol, be sure to head over to our exclusive cover hub below, where you'll find our preview impressions, the GI cover reveal, and more looks at the game in the upcoming days. Thanks, as always, for watching.",

          "description": "Remakes of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 and 4 were planned at some point until publisher Activision pulled the plug. This news comes from Tony Hawk himself, who discussed the series with streamer andyTHPS. \nAccording to Hawk, the \"plan\" was to develop remakes for THPS 3 and 4 following the release of the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2 remake. That plan, however, got complicated after Activision merged THPS1 and 2 developer Vicarious Visions into Blizzard. \n\"The truth of it is that they were trying to find someone to do [Tony Hawk's Pro Skater] 3 and 4, but they just didn't really trust anyone the way they did Vicarious, so they took other pitches from other studios,\" Hawk says in the clip. \"Like, 'What would you do with a THPS title?' And they didn't like anything they heard, and then that was it.\"\nYou can watch the full clip below: \nTony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 remasters were in the works but they were scrapped after Vicarious Visions was merged into Blizzard. 😔\nhttps://t.co/84rlYDgvUQ pic.twitter.com/oWR70xTOYv\nJune 20, 2022\nAt the very least, it doesn't sound like THPS3 and 4 was actively in development. As Hawk says in the clip, it was planned, but he never indicates it was in production. More curious is Activision's interest in taking the series in new directions. Historically, that's been a bad idea.  \nThe news is particularly painful because, after a drought of skateboarding games, the excellent Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2 seemed to indicate the king of action sports was back. As we said in our review,  \"the Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater franchise may once again have a bright future thanks to this terrific blast from the past.\" Alas, history proves otherwise. \nBut actually, skateboarding games have had a renaissance in recent years. Of course, there's Vicarious Visions' Tony Hawk's Pro Skater reboot. There's also OlliOlli World, Skate City, Session, and Skater XL.",

          "description": "Darth Vader was apparently sick and tired of being trapped in Fortnite's Battle Pass and is now waging war against all players. In a new update to the battle royale game, the Sith Lord is unleashed and he won't hesitate to take you down, but if you can take him out first, you'll get his lightsaber as a reward.\nVader appears in random places each match but is easy to locate since he arrives at the island at the same time as the players. When you are in the Battle Bus, look for an Imperial Shuttle. It'll enter the airspace just above the clouds and will quickly descend to a spot on the map. The Shuttle is highlighted with a blue glow for a few seconds after settling down on the surface.\nVader is one of the toughest bosses in the game and will take some serious firepower to take out. He's also flanked by two stormtroopers. He uses the Force in a variety of ways to mess with you and can block your shots. Your best bet is to attack him from afar with a sniper rifle or approach in a group. \nHis lightsaber is a game-changer. You too can block shots with it, and it can also be thrown a decent distance to inflict big damage. Of course, you can swing it widely for melee strikes. We don't know how long Vader will be around or how he is influencing the story, but it's awesome to see him on the island dishing out punishment. Here's hoping more Star Wars integration is on the way soon!",

If a studio wants to take a new crack at an old game, especially if it’s the studio behind the original release, why not? It’s not like I have to buy the game, and who knows, it could be a new favorite for me. That’s what happened with FF7R. I love Final Fantasy 7, and I was worried the remake would not do it justice.

Over the next few weeks, we’ll be covering the history and lore of Capcom’s premiere action franchise. This week we go all the way to hell with Dante as we unpack the mysterious low-point in the series, Devil May Cry 2.\nReleasing a short 15 months after the release of Devil May Cry, Dante returns with a 2-disc adventure that’s more often than not seen as the worst game in the series, and there are very good reasons as to why it turned out that way. In this episode of Video Gameography, we talk about the tumultuous development cycle that didn’t include the team behind DMC, Team Little Devils. From an unknown first director to arcade-focused developers making their first console game and a late transition of direction, Devil May Cry 2 has all of the trappings of a project that would have been canceled. That is, if not for the man who would shepherd the series for years to come. \nJoin hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), John Carson (@John_Carson), along with Game Informer Editor-In-Chief Andrew Reiner (@Andrew_Reiner) \nIf you’d like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com.

          "description": "Nerf, the leading foam dart and water weapon manufacturer, has unveiled its first-ever mascot, which fittingly goes by the name Murph. Murph Nerfington (I gave them the last name) will represent the company as part of a multi-year marketing push in social media, public events, and more.\nMurph looks like a Koosh mascot more than a Nerf representative, although that would still be under the Hasbro umbrella. However, if you look closely, you can see Murph is made entirely out of foam Nerf darts. The new character was created in association with a new summer initiative for the company to invite families to get out and play. Also, given the language of they/them pronouns in the mascot's announcement, Murph doesn’t have a set gender. So happy Pride month, Murph! The company even has a new mnemonic that Murph embodies, “Unleash the play in you.” I’m not sure what hard-to-remember topic this mnemonic is supposed to remind us of, but it’s a cute enough slogan nonetheless.\nBelow are a handful of promotional images of Murph handing some new Nerf weapons and looking like a late 2000s physics tech demo. \n\nIn a press release shared with Game Informer, here’s what Adam Kleinman, senior vice president and general manager of Nerf, has to say to welcome Murph into existence: \n“The launch of Murph is a testament to the success of Hasbro’s Brand Blueprint strategy and turning Nerf into the social, active play brand it is seen as today. We are thrilled to introduce Murph to fans, a mascot that represents the playful spirit that lives inside us all and is unleashed through Nerf.”\nIf you see Murph around this summer, make sure to give them a nice cold spray from your Nerf Super Soaker. You'd be doing them a favor; it has to be hotter than hell in that suit.\nWhere on the mascot family tree do you think Murph belongs? Is it on the branch with Gritty, or maybe with AM/PM's Toomgis? How about with the McDonald's Fry Kids? Let us know in the comments!",

          "description": "A new Game of Thrones series is reportedly in the works, and it will reunite fans with Jon Snow after the events of the show’s finale. \nThe Hollywood Reporter states that HBO has begun developing the live-action spin-off series, reporting that Kit Harrington is attached to reprise his role as Jon Snow should it proceed. HBO and Kit Harrington’s representatives did not respond to THR’s request for comment. \nFans last saw the character in the Season 8 finale, which saw him venture beyond the Wall after being exiled from Westeros. A follow-up story would, presumably, center on Jon’s new life with the Wildlings. \nAnother Game of Thrones spin-off, the prequel show House of the Dragon, is set to premiere on HBO Max on August 21. That series focuses on House Targaryen 200 years before the original show. It's far from the only TV show in the pipeline based on George R.R. Martin's best-selling series. Other adjacent projects, such as 10,000 Ships, The Golden Empire, 9 Voyages, and Dunk and Egg, are in various stages of development. \n[Source: The Hollywood Reporter]",

Instead, we had the third annual Geoff Keighley's Summer Game Fest and a handful of connected and not-so-connected streams and events from other gaming media outlets and publishers. While we had a full weekend of games on display and more than enough to cover, there's something about the current setup for the game industry's biggest info dump of the year that's leaving me frustrated and unsatisfied. I find myself missing the tight encapsulation of excitement E3 used to provide.\nWhat I'd like to see return next year is the attempt to cram all of the big summer industry news into one week or a timeframe close to it.

The first original IP developed by the prolific studio in over 25 years, Starfield is expected to redefine science fiction RPGs with unparalleled ambition, boasting considerable customization options and scale. I’m as intrigued by this game as any avid space opera fan. Still, this “unparalleled ambition” worries me. \nSunday’s gameplay footage ended with what Bethesda likely thought was a big bang (pun intended). Players can land anywhere on any planet in any solar system of their choice or, as Howard excitedly put it, “Over 100 systems. Over 1,000 planets.

With that change in business model, Blizzard Entertainment is now offering a bundle for the unreleased game with plenty of cosmetics and extras, including beta access.

Dragon's Dogma 2 is officially in the works and is set to land in 2023.\n\n\nThe announcement came as part of a video presentation commemorating the decade that's passed since Dragon's Dogma first arrived on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Hideaki Itsuno, the game's director, and key dev team members, Daigo Ikeno and Kenichi Suzuki, announced the game by unzipping their hoodies triumphantly at the end of the presentation, revealing the name \"Dragon's Dogma II,\" which was followed by a short animation of the official logo treatment to close out the video.\nBefore the big announcement, Itsuno introduced a look back at the development of Dragon's Dogma. It's a fascinating look at the director and his inspirations in fighting games like Street Fighter and melding that kind of flexible combat system with an expansive RPG story and gameplay. He also goes into the creation of the pawn system and wanting to make a single-player RPG that felt like playing with your friends online. The presentation is worth a watch for this mini-documentary alone.\nThere's no date for Dragon's Dogma 2, or any footage of the game yet, but having it in development is a huge step forward for the series after all this time. Capcom has confirmed the game is being built using the company's RE Engine, which powers games like Resident Evil Village, Monster Hunter Rise, and the upcoming Street Fighter 6.\nWhat do you want to see from the newly-announced Dragon's Dogma sequel?

Events like Steam's Next Fest even let us get our hands on playable slices to better understand what these games are and how they play. Starting next week, Xbox will again be offering playable demos for indie titles in a week-long event that console players can dive into and experience the near future for indie gaming.\nThe ID@Xbox Summer Game Fest Demo Event will run from June 21 through June 27 and includes over 30 game demos for gamers to try out. In the blog post announcing the event, Xbox reminds readers that these are the equivalent of \"show floor\" demos and are a work in progress. Each of the participating demos will only be available during the days of the demo event and will be taken down after. Because these games aren't complete yet, the blog also asks players to share their feedback with developers to help make the best game possible.\nXbox isn't ready to share the full list of games for the event yet but did provide four titles that will be included.\nBatora: Lost Haven\nBroken Pieces\nSevered Steel\nTinykin\nSome of these game demos are available through Steam Next Fest (or are out on PC already), so if you have a capable PC and can't wait until next week, you can take a peek at these games early.",

Bethesda also revealed additional information about the game, including details about its different characters, co-op, and more. \nFollowing that reveal, Redfall game designer Harvey Smith spoke to IGN in a new interview about the title’s co-op and how it works. Here, Smith revealed that Redfall’s campaign progress is tied to the host of the co-op party and that it’s only persistent for that host, as reported by GamesRadar. This means that if you’re teaming up with someone to play co-op and you’re not the host, you will not receive the campaign progress they might after completing a level. \n\n\n“So for the flow of things, you want to have to redo those,” Smith said. “The story would be very confusing if you got to mission eight and it said, ‘skip this one because you’ve already done it.'\"\nSmith said that Arkane initially tried to give every player some “credit” for completing a given level when they aren’t the host. However, this didn’t work out, as those same players would then run into that same mission again when playing solo or as the host of their own co-op session. However, Smith told IGN that character progression aspects such as loot and XP would carry over to your campaign. \nOf course, with Redfall recently delayed out of 2022 and into 2023, things could change. In the meantime, watch Bethesda’s thrilling and bloody Redfall gameplay recently revealed, and then catch up on all the biggest gaming news from the 2022 Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase. \n[Source: IGN via GamesRadar]\nAre you going to play Redfall solo or in co-op?
