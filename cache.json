Well, another is set to join the scarcely-discussed collection this week, as The Samurai Collection (QUByte Classics) comes to Switch on 3rd November, 2022.\nThe collection brings together two beat 'em ups from the 1990s: First Samurai and Second Samurai. Originally released in 1991 for the Amiga and Atari ST, the first of these titles was later ported to the SNES, while its 1993 follow up came only to the Amiga and SEGA Mega Drive.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Still, at its price point it hits a punch, and the boffins at HUKD have spotted a good deal for the 5800X at CCL. There, you can find the 5800X for £235 when you use code AFF15 with some nifty extras: a 64GB Micro SD card and a code for Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves. \nThe way it works is pretty simple - you need to get your total basket over £250 for the AFF15 code to work. So, pick anything on the store that's more than £5.51, like this Micro SD card, add it to your basket alongside the 5800X, then use the AFF15 code to bring the price down to the £235 we quoted. The game code will come with your order, no opt-in necessary, from what we understand. \nRead more",

Players can move around each of the squares to solve puzzles or click inside each square to interact with the scene.

The trick involves trading gold farmed in WOW for tokens that convert to Battle.net balance, which can then be spent on Overwatch 2 cosmetics. It’s a cunning ploy that speaks volumes about player frustration with the multiplayer shooter’s new free to play mechanics, a situation that might still change if Blizzard listen to results of a recent survey.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Too late now! Plus, witches are totally Halloween fodder - and they're one of my key trends for games at the moment. Video games are lousy with both current and upcoming witches these days.\nIt makes sense. They've already got brilliant marketing. Few Halloween-y sights are more iconic than a pointy hat, a black cat, and a sihouetted figure flying in front of the moon on a broomstick. The witches I've collected here are definitely going to get you in the pumpkin spirit, even if they manage to run through most other genres except horror... Look, Halloween is mostly about sweets and dressing up these days anyway (and by the way, I am livid that I've not got any parties to go to this year, because my hair is exactly the right length to do a perfect Carmy Berzatto costume).\nRead more",

Its four main characters, Diya, Min-seo, Noelle, and Akarsha, use the liquefaction of a caterpillar inside a cocoon as a metaphor for the awkward teenage growing phase they’re all in. In the sequel, set a few months later, they find a butterfly with a crumpled wing. It’s a victim of a false spring, having emerged from its cocoon too early due to unseasonably warm weather. One of them worries that they are like the injured insect; forever marked by their early life. And it’s this that Butterfly Soup 2 digs into much more deeply than its predecessor.\nIf you’re not familiar with the original, Butterfly Soup is a visual novel about four Asian girls navigating high school in the late 2000s, playing baseball, and falling in love. On replaying it to get ready for this review, it made me cry at least twice and laugh out loud a bunch more. It’s pay what you want with no minimum price, and takes about 2-3 hours. I’m also going to spoil parts of it, so go play it already.\nRead more",

          "description": "Stress Level Zero's Boneworks was Half-life: Alyx before Half-Life: Alyx released. Released in December 2019, its combination of deeply tactile interactions with a campaign heavily inspired by Half-Life 2 represented a major step forward for VR experiences at the time. It had a fair few rough edges, and you needed a cast-iron stomach to play it, but for about four months it was the ambitious, all-encompassing VR experience that the medium had hitherto lacked.\nThen Half-Life: Alyx came around, raising the (crow)bar so high that you'd need to be Mr Fantastic or some sort of bird with hands to reach it. Which is partly why Bonelab, the newly released sequel to Boneworks, hasn't quite gelled with me in the way its older sibling did. Technologically, its still very impressive, and noodling around with its massive interactive potential remains undeniably fun. But it often feels like a lot of good ideas with too little connective tissue between them. It's also even less compromising on your physiology than Boneworks was, seemingly determined to make existing in VR as uncomfortable as possible.\nRead more",

My first thought as I crouched behind a nearby rock and surveyed its chromium splendour was: \"I am definitely not yet ready to fight this thing.\"\nMy second thought came quickly after the first, when my cover was blown by a nearby Watcher that immediately reared back and emitted a shrill noise that alerted the Thunderjaw to my presence. \"Oh shite.

It is a complicated, huge, and ponderous alien invasion simulator that constantly threatens to drop the other boot on you the entire time. Anything you do could be the butterfly whose little wingflaps eventually result in the obliteration of the planet. It is not a game to be powered through, but to be played and contemplated exclusively for a solid month.\nThat is its central weakness. But I think it had to be this way.

On at least one occasion I lay in bed at 3am, sweaty and frozen in half-asleep fear, because I thought I'd heard a strange rattling noise...\nIn fact it was not stillness, but the panic-sprint into darkness that became my main and oft-unsuccessful tactic whenever I heard the creature of Gravoi. Gravoi itself is a small but inconveniently maze-like fictional Sardinian town, host to a yearly folk festival that, every so often, involves the unwary being carried off and killed by a... something. Unfortunately, four very unwary outsiders - rendered outsiders for a variety of reasons, whether they're locals or not - find themselves having to survive the night of this festival, armed with things like matches, firecrackers and a polaroid camera.\nRead more",

When you use code HUKDAW3821DW, this monitor drops from £1299 to £899, an incredible value for a monitor of this spec. \nLet's quickly run through those specs. This 38-in monitor has a resolution of 3840x1600, essentially a shorter version of 4K, with a 144Hz refresh rate. The monitor is Nvidia G-Sync Ultimate certified, meaning it has a physical G-Sync module to prevent judder and tearing, and it also gets bright enough to earn the lofty DisplayHDR 600 rating. All in all, it's a ton of monitor for a fairly reasonable price. \nRead more",

Now that Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (the second one) is out in full, not just its campaign, I’ve revisited my best settings guide to see whether it can provide a preset-beating balance of looks and performance in the multiplayer component as well. And it does! If anything the various online modes tend to run more smoothly and consistently than the singleplayer story, but whichever you prefer playing, you can make just a few key changes to visibly improve your frames per second. And a COD with more frames just feels better.\nDespite this universal truth, MW2 can be a toughie on older PC hardware: even graphics cards listed among the recommended system requestions need quality cuts to get a stable 60fps at 1080p. In this guide I’ll be showing you how various GPUs perform and where, precisely, the make those cuts if needed.\nRead more",

Yet they can be poignant, dramatic reminders of friends and family that meant a lot to characters too, depending on who the shambling corpse used to be.

Instead I played RTS games as though they were city-builders, with the added bonus of absolutely steamrolling through the AI when I'd had enough fun.\nThis was true of basically every RTS I played back then. In Starcraft I'd amass an army of Protoss Carriers and launch them across the map. In Supreme Commander, I'd tech all the way up to the Experimental Weapons, and then send the colossal CZAR Mothership to Independence-Day the entire enemy base. But my favourite variation of this was in Impossible Creatures: a wonderful early noughties strategy game where you create your own units by stitching together parts from different animals.\n Read more",

Here are five games in which your mates can play as the monster. Some are creepy, some are cute, and none of them will force you to run around alone.

I don't want to go out of my way to be mean, and I also don't want to spend hours not enjoying myself. I go into almost every game I play actively wanting to enjoy it (the exception being things like Succubus, which I can only assume are trying an avant garde technique to plumb new, unexplored depths of badness on purpose).\nAs it turned out, a lot of other reviewers did like it. I'm not going to object to that, because it takes all sorts to make a world, and so on. Rather, it made me wonder if I'd sort of hallucinated how much I liked the first Tales From The Borderlands. How fantastic it was, managing to be both the best Telltale game and the best Borderlands game in one, was a big part of why I was so excited for New Tales. It came out a long time ago, and I hadn't played it for a while. Maybe it wasn't how I remembered. Maybe I'd changed, you know?\nRead more",

The instantly legible historical warfare  -  “pikemen, ranged units and cavalry” - paired with randomised maps that promised, effectively, an infinite amount of replayability; “It just had a lot of features that I think players really loved and kind of defined itself along those features in a way that, yeah, it's just outlasted everything else.”\r\n\n \nRead more",

I was all geared up for some science fiction-tinged Spice Girls shenanigans, but I was left bitterly disappointed. However, I’d already installed it, so I decided to check it out and see what kind of game it actually is. Turns out that Victoria 3 is a grand strategy game, just like its Paradox stablemates Crusader Kings and Hearts of Iron.\nTrying to classify Victoria 3 is pretty damn important. Unlike, say, the Total War series, Paradox’s grand strategy titles are differentiated by a lot more than their time periods. Hearts of Iron its WW2 military ticker on its sleeve, while Crusader Kings (my personal fave) is secretly an RPG, just one that happens to cast you as the ruler of a country, rather than a random wandering murderer.

While I have to admit there's some pretty damning circumstantial evidence there and that not every accusation is exactly unfounded, the game's memetic unpopularity even among people who never played it still feels harsher than is warranted.\n Read more",

Chew on that for a second.\r\n\nI'm not just talking about games that belong to the horror genre, either. In fact, spare those asymmetrical multiplayer games that are all the rage with their worryingly young audiences, there are few actual horror games that let you assume the role of the villain. But that doesn't mean there isn't a deluge of titles where you play as a creature so vile, so menacing, that the residents of their worlds undoubtly view the player as evil incarnate. Far from it. The games on this list may not all be spooky in tone, but your character is still the stuff of actual nightmares.\nRead more",

Kotaku AU seem to have corroborated this, finding a record on the Estonian Ministry of Justice's website showing Telomer has filed an application against ZA/UM Studio to \"obtain information and review documents\", which you can see for yourself here.\nThis comes after Martin Luiga announced (in a frankly kinda weird post) the dissolution of The ZA/UM Cultural Association, and that Kurvitz, writer Helen Hindpere, and art director Aleksander Rostov were no longer working at Studio ZA/UM.\r\n \nRead more",

Not because we're die-hard horror buffs - if anything, we're both lifelong wimps when it comes to this stuff. But buoyed by a growing resolve to tackle our collective cowardice head on, October has seen us watch, play and read several of the big horror classics we've been too chicken to attempt in the past. Over the course of it all, though, there's been a gnawing, slightly dreadful realisation slowly bubbling away beneath the surface. Far from being scared by these horrible things, I've often come away feeling no emotions whatsoever. I have remained unmoved, neither frightened, unnerved, or creeped out. Just plain, simple indifference. The Japanese Ring? Nothing. I Saw The Devil? Nah, mate. Lake Mungo? More like Lake Yawngo.\nI was beginning to think I'd lost the capacity to feel anything at all. Heck, the real horror show this month has been the collapse of the entire UK nation state, and yet I still cannot bring myself to muster anything beyond a tired sigh. Then I got to the second act of Resident Evil Village's Shadows Of Rose DLC and, oh yes, hello fear. It's been a while, hasn't it?\nRead more",

          "description": "Over three million consoles moved in last quarter\nSony Interactive Entertainment has released its financial results for fiscal year ending September 30, 2022, which shows that its most recent hardware platform, PlayStation 5 (PS5), has smashed past 25 million global shipments since its initial launch in November 2020.\nAccording to the data, the shiny white behemoth shipped 3.3 million units in the most recent quarter, more or less matching the same period in 2021 and thus presenting steady sales for the (admittedly expensive) hardware. While there have been some struggles getting the ninth generation off to a strong start — impacted by production woes, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the cost of living crisis — it appears that sales of the PS5 system remain relatively comfortable for the time being.\nIn addition to the hardware figures, SIE also revealed that there are currently 45.4 million PlayStation Plus subscribers, though this figure is down some 1.8 million users from the same time frame one year ago. Much like Microsoft's the Xbox Game Pass service, it seems that PlayStation is continually struggling to grow its subscriber base, which had seen nothing but growth until the 2021 economy slump. Still, 45 million players is nothing to be sniffed at, and so it is unlikely that the publisher will be too concerned.\nFurther decline was seen in total game sales, with PS4 and PS5 combined software sales down a huge 13.9 million units over 2021, for a grand total of 62.5 million games sold. 63% of all full game sales were digital purchases — demonstrating that while the digital market continues its inevitable growth, physical media is not quite ready to be consigned to the garbage pile just yet.\nThe post PS5 hits 25 million global shipments milestone appeared first on Destructoid.",

Players guide a mysterious protagonist as they venture across the plains and dunes astride a futuristic hoverbike, searching lonely caves, crumbling ruins, and encountering forgotten nomadic civilizations while on a search for their own identity.\nYou can check out Sable's fascinating world and evocative visual style in the trailer below.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0dPJN1Y8hM\nUpon release, the title was praised for its enigmatic and open narrative, as well as its striking visuals and beautiful score, composed by artist Japanese Breakfast. The PS5 edition will feature the game in its entirety, with further optimization for the DualSense' Haptic Feedback technology. In addition, the PS5 version will feature a new fishing mini-game, allowing the player to gather rare breeds of finned wonderment to display in an in-game aquarium. As we all know, it isn't a real game without fishing.\nSable will launch on PS5 November 29. It is available right now on PC and Xbox platforms.\nThe post Sable brings its mesmerizing adventure to PS5 in November appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The dungeon crawler makes its way to PC\nDungeon-crawling RPG Kowloon High School Chronicle is making its way to PC via Steam. Arc System Works is releasing the updated version of the PS2 RPG onto Steam on November 10.\nThis remastered version has already been released for Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4. Now, PC players will get a chance to check out this older dungeon crawler. The Steam page is live here.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgFfhjaPoZc\nKowloon High School Chronicle first launched for PlayStation 2 in Japan, back in 2004. The new remaster not only brings it to new systems, but adds some revamped graphics.\nThe set-up of Kowloon is pretty interesting, too. You play a young treasure hunter masquerading as a transfer student. During the day, the player attends class and hangs out with friends, using a novel and slightly bizarre conversation system to foster relationships.\nThen at night, the protagonist and their party can venture into the labyrinths and catacombs beneath the school, in pursuit of hidden treasure. This is where it becomes a first-person dungeon crawler, with some pretty neat puzzles.\nDaily life of treasure hunters\nI've played a solid chunk of the Nintendo Switch version of Kowloon High School Chronicle, and it's definitely a different kind of RPG. Between the style, music, and life sim elements, it's got a fair bit of Persona in it.\nBut I'm also a big fan of crunchy, weird interfaces and old internet UI. I mean, look at this wanted ad from the game's in-universe internet.\n\nIf you want something offbeat, this might be what you're looking for. Especially those of you looking to load up the Steam Deck with RPGs before the holidays.\nKowloon High School Chronicle hits PC via Steam on November 10, and is also currently available on PS4 and Switch.\nThe post Kowloon High School Chronicle hunts for treasure on Steam in November appeared first on Destructoid.",

Apparently the residing Koroks are \"in distress,\" and it's up to you to solve the mystery of the haunted zone and square off against a new foe called the Ghost Rider. If they appear you need to outrun them, or head back to the Korok Forest to get them off your tail. When the appear, the screen goes dark purple, and there's a sufficiently scary freak-out sequence.\nThe gist is that you'll embark upon a journey to collect 30 Cursed Pumpkins, which a friendly Korok named Socki can use to make a stew to dispel the magic therein. You'll don a spooky outfit for the occasion (which is required to avoid the detection of the aforementioned monster), and the quest has a 30-minute timer on it. Once you're finished you can take out the Ghost Rider once and for all!\nAs usual, everyone involved (including Waikuteru and their friend Sockpoppet, who worked on custom enemies and items for the mod) is a talented bunch: the Zelda: Breath of the Wild modding community is outstanding in terms of scope.\nFootage of the fan-made Zelda: Breath of the Wild Halloween DLC mod:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGekwhf44Tc\n[Thanks Rick!]\nThe post This Zelda: Breath of the Wild Halloween Hunt DLC mod looks official appeared first on Destructoid.",

The news comes straight from the game's official Discord, where a developer Q&A confirmed it.\nWhile the Q&A was conducted over voice, MP1st managed to get the full transcription, where combat lead Mihir Sheth spilled the beans on God of War Ragnarok transmog:\nQ: \"Since we’re talking about armor. I like to look good, alright everyone at the studio knows this about me. Fashion first for Kratos, of course. I know one of the request for 2018 was the ability to maybe have the stats you want, but you know, give Kratos the runway look you want. So this is a question from SpiritWolf and a lot of other people; Will there be an armor transmog system?\"\nMihir Sheth: \"The short answer is yes. There is a way to do it…it’s there in the game.\"\n\nThe answer is a bit cryptic, and it's unclear whether or not it's going to be a free-for-all anything goes model (where you can just toggle it), or if it needs to be unlocked/requires a reagent/consumable of some kind. Either way, it's confirmed in some form.\nAt this point with any AAA game with gear, transmog is not only a highly-requested feature, but expected.

          "description": "An adventure classic is being remade from the ground up\nCyan is remaking another one of its classics, this time in Riven. The studio has announced it is developing a Riven remake from the ground up.\nRiven, or Riven: The Sequel to Myst, will be getting a full, modern remake. Cyan's already produced a remake for Myst, and it seems like this will be a similar undertaking.\nIn an FAQ online, Cyan addresses the basics. Yes, this is a remake from the ground up, not a remaster. The new Riven remake will also be fully traversable in 3D.\nNo details on platforms or dates have been announced yet. But this will be a new game, so expect to buy a new product, rather than get it for free if you already have the classic Riven.\nAs to why Cyan is doing this now, and after 25 years? Here's their explanation:\n\"Riven is one of the most highly regarded games in Cyan’s history. We didn’t want to approach it lightly or frivolously. Cyan is a small indie studio. We wanted to make sure we could take on such a difficult, costly and complicated endeavor – and do it well.\"\n\nhttps://twitter.com/cyanworlds/status/1587065601339424770\nRemaking the sequel to Myst\nThere was also a fan project in the works, the Starry Expanse Project, to remake Riven. Alongside news of the remake, Cyan confirms that project has been ceased development. The Starry Expanse team continues to exist, independent from Cyan, though the two teams collaborated early on to kickstart the official remake development, according to Cyan's letter. One member of the Starry Expanse team has also been hired by Cyan.\n\"So for the first time publicly, we are happy to report that our effort to remake Riven officially here at Cyan is alive and well, and it was helped by the Starry Expanse team’s years of effort, enabling us to begin the huge task of rebuilding Riven from scratch,\" said Cyan. \"With a very focused development team here at Cyan, Riven is well on its way to being reborn!\"\nThe post Riven, the sequel to Myst, is getting a remake appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "$5 straight cash compared to 700 Overwatch bux\nYikes! That's just about the only thing that can sum up a lot of Overwatch 2 news post-launch, but this Overwatch 2 charm situation is so funny it has to be shared.\nOver on the Overwatch Reddit, user hi_im_redbeard shared an anecdote that showcased how out of control the monetization scheme is in Overwatch 2. In short, they purchased a real life Pachimari keychain/charm that they can hold in their hand for cheaper than it costs to buy the same Overwatch 2 charm in-game. Showing their work, the Pachimari charm (literally just an in-game side item, almost NFT-like in nature) is 700 Overwatch Coins, which is more than $5 (which converts to 500 Coins). Yep, you have to do the standard scummy \"buy more than you need\" conversion here, so it's even more expensive than roughly $7 if you need to top up.\nThere are plenty of economic nuances afoot, and this wouldn't be the first time something like this happened; as some games (Pokemon Unite included) can put out insanely high-priced limited-run skins that are more expensive than an action figure of the character in question. But this particular incident showcases how Overwatch 2, in its move to \"free-to-play\" (and erasing the original premium game) has shoved in even more ways to monetize its audience with new cosmetics.\nWhen some fans are asking to bring loot boxes back, you know you have a monetization problem. It'll be interesting to see just how much content Overwatch 2 gets over time, how it's even further monetized, and what the PVE element brings to the table (more monetization?).\nThe post Hilariously, someone pointed out that it’s cheaper to buy this Overwatch 2 charm in real life compared to the game appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's set to debut in the The Brothers' War set, which is out on November 11 via pre-release, November 15 in Arena, and November 18 in paper Magic.\nAs a reminder, here's a quick rundown of the lore for the release, to set the mood:\n\"Through nefarious means, the evil Phyrexians establish a foothold on Dominaria. They secretly transform ordinary citizens into deadly sleeper agents who go about their lives, ignorant of their new purpose. As word of the Phyrexian incursion spreads, the people of Dominaria attempt to band together as the sleeper agents threaten to tear them apart.\"\n\nThe Brothers' War is going to have all sorts of lore implications, and follows the Dominaria United set that arrived back in September. From here, we'll be delving even further into the story of the Phyrexians, with Phyrexia: All Will Be One, slated for January 2023. It's a pretty busy block for Magic, as the Dominaria storyline/setting once again is hitting it pretty big with the community.\nDestructoid's exclusive Magic Arena card: Audacity\n\nAs for the card itself, it's an enchantment aura called Audacity that costs 1G, enchants a creature, and provides a +2/+0 and trample bonus. When Audacity is put into the graveyard from the battlefield, you draw a card.\nThis is the sort of thing you wouldn't mind drawing in most Magic formats, limited included. A low cost always ensures that it's generally playable (or very playable), and although it's not a flash/instant-speed enchantment. Plus, the art from Rudy Siswanto is killer and wonderfully showcases the direct conflict from the lore.\nAs usual, I can't wait to pick one up and put it in a toploader!\nThe post Exclusive: Here’s a look at a new The Brothers’ War card coming to paper Magic and Magic Arena appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Producer Cory Barlog shared his frustration\nA situation that led to God of War Ragnarok being leaked has led to a full confirmation of said leak from the game's producer (Cory Barlog), a bit of venting, and a public warning.\nAs Barlog points out, a retailer has broken street date and sold God of War Ragnarok roughly two weeks before the November 9 release date; leading to posts online about the game, including screens, and down the line, potentially spoiler-related content. Consider this your warning!\nHere's a full recap of Barlog's sentiments on Twitter over the weekend:\n\"You know, right now, I can really understand the benefit of having just an installer on the physical disc. Smh. A retailer selling the game nearly TWO WEEKS before release. just so disappointing. Sorry to everyone that you have to dodge the spoilers if you want to play the game fresh. completely fucking stupid you have to do this. this is not at all how any of us at SMS wanted things to go. To be clear, I was expressing my frustration in the first tweet. not advocating for that at all. Not the future i want as a gamer or dev. just so beyond frustrated. Feel terrible for the team. This whole ordeal is incredibly stressful for us all. Mental health break time.\"\n\nOn the bright side, for Sony, God of War as a whole is a pretty impenetrable franchise that people will buy regardless. By that same token, it's also so massive that a leak was almost inevitable: though several weeks early is not really the norm in many cases.\nThe big takeaway for everyone: be careful if you want to avoid spoilers!\nThe post Warning, God of War Ragnarok leaked early, so watch out for spoilers appeared first on Destructoid.",

That's three decades of demon summoning, spinoffs, and success wrapped up in one tweet, with a few classic demons worked into the logo (like Jack Frost, Pyro Jack, and Pixie) to boot.\nAs Atlus points out, the series began in Japan on October 30, 1992: a sufficiently spooky release window, inline with the dark themes that the series typically plays with. Now it's celebrating three decades in existence, with spinoffs that have spinoffs. The staying power of the SMT name is pretty awe-inspiring.\nRecent Shin Megami Tensei happenings\nAs the Shin Megami Tensei art tweet shows the series as a whole is still going strong, having just launched Soul Hackers 2 this year, and Shin Megami Tensei V in 2021. The Persona umbrella is also enjoying a huge resplendent re-release era on multiple platforms, and arguably the best core SMT game, Nocturne, was remastered recently. Smartly, Atlus knows a lot of the older entries will still hold up with a few minor modern tweaks.\nShin Megami Tensei isn't going anywhere for a long time.\nhttps://twitter.com/megaten_atlus/status/1586372292552130560\nThe post Atlus shares 30th anniversary Shin Megami Tensei art appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Welcome (back) to the jungle\nA new recruitment video from studio Virtuos has sparked internet whispers that the global game developer has started work on a new Metal Gear Solid project. The rumors circulated this weekend after \"clues\" were spotted in the presentation, which was designed to spotlight the studio's Montreal team.\nWhile speaking with one of Virtuos' key concepts artists, Louis-Alex Boismenu, the hefty (and highly recommended) tome \"The Art of Metal Gear Solid\" is placed tantalizingly in shot, with the book seemingly being used to prop up Boismenu's desk lamp. This might seem to be \"reaching\" on the fans' part, but it is rare that videos such as these would include such an odd detail. You'd think the book would be cleared aside during shot-blocking. I would have done so and I'm basically Kubrick.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWjDzBrmveo&t=73s\nLending further weight to this theory are rumors, sourced by VGC back in 2021, that Virtuos might have been handed the contract to develop a remake of 2004 adventure Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. This still unconfirmed rumor, coupled with some recent recruitment adverts and the aforementioned video, has led fans to believe that the studio is working on something Metal Gear Solid-related. However, who knows quite what is on the books or when the truth will out, remains a mystery.\nAll that said, it must be noted that sometimes a lamp prop is just a lamp prop... Still, it's not hard to admit that these various clues are all starting to add up.\nThe post Virtuos video sparks whispers of new Metal Gear Solid project appeared first on Destructoid.",

Long live Geralt of Rivia\nIf you've been on social media at all in the past few days or managed to make it through the entirety of Black Adam, you've probably heard that Henry Cavill is once again suiting up as the Man of Steel. Whether or not his return to the DC Extended Universe will finally help Warner Bros. get that disaster train back on track remains to be seen. What we do know is that Cavill will be walking away from the role that's kept him busy in the years since he had to have his mustache digitally removed in post-production. It was announced today that Cavill is stepping down as Geralt of Rivia in the hit Netflix adaptation of The Witcher.\nhttps://twitter.com/witchernetflix/status/1586433840318648321\nAs you can see in the tweet above, Cavill will be replaced in season 4 by Robert California Liam Hemsworth. The second-tier Hemsworth is probably best known for his role as Gale Hawthrone in the Hunger Games films and, like many of his fellow Aussies, a brief stint on the soap opera Neighbours. He also did a show for Quibi. Raise your hand if you remember Quibi.\nWhile Cavill is leaving the Netflix series behind, fans will still be able to see him as Geralt when The Witcher's third season debuts sometime next year. If you're like me and just subscribed to Netflix for the first time in six years a few days ago, know there is a lot of Witcher content to consume on the streamer, including the animated film The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf and The Witcher: Blood Origin, a prequel series that'll debut in December (fingers crossed it's better than that dreary House of the Dragon). In addition to all that, a second animated film has also been commissioned and there is apparently a family-friendly spin-off in the works.\nThe post Henry Cavill is flying up up and away from the fourth season of The Witcher appeared first on Destructoid.",

We're just days away from the launches of Square-Enix's Harvestella and Doraemon Story of Seasons: Friends of the Great Kingdom, while Disney Dreamlight Valley is proving popular enough for people looking to get their farming fix with a heaping dose of Disney magic. Plenty of stuff to enjoy right now, but it's a game that's launching next year that has me more excited than anything else. Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life remake heads our way in a matter of months. Initially revealed for the Nintendo Switch, Xseed Games confirmed this week the A Wonderful Life remake will launch on all modern platforms simultaneously in North America.\nSet in the tranquil Forgotten Valley, A Wonderful Life tasks players with building up a farm and seeing it through to the end of their character's life. Life with other games in the series, players can get married and start a family, but your decisions will determine if your kid carries on the family tradition of running the farm or setting off to discover their own path in life. As has already been confirmed, all marriage candidates can be romanced no matter your farmer's chosen gender, and players can make their farmer non-binary.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IkVCpBG89I\nThe Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life remake will release on Nintendo Switch, PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S next summer.

The company wants to launch its super game by March 2026, at the latest.\nThe super game is something the company has talked about before, as part of its long-term strategy. And in a recent financial filing, Sega is ballparking it for a launch sometime before March 2026.\nAs for what a super game is, Sega CEO Haruki Satomi describes it as a large-scale, global title. The ultimate goal for this project is to generate more active users than any other games they've made thus far.\n\"One key to achieving this goal is whether we can draw together a large community, involving not only players but also streamers who stream the game and viewers who watch their videos,\" said Satomi in the filing. \"That kind of community expands and further develops game content, adding value to the game that is unimagined by developers, and sparking a broader movement—which can then draw in even more users and grow the game’s presence dramatically.\"\nThere have been some rumors about what the super game project might entail, but we've still yet to get a firm idea.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XET9s-9PLas\nA new frontier\nWe do know that this super game isn't Sonic Frontiers, which is set to launch in November. Sega also has a few other games in store between now and 2026, like the recently revealed Like a Dragon: Ishin.\nThere's more in the works for Sega's older IP, too. In the filing today, the company specifically cites \"dormant\" IP. The company will continue to develop these by \"means of remakes, remastering, and reboots,\" so it sounds like more old Sega hits could see the limelight.\nThe post Sega aims to create ‘super game’ by March 2026 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Let's talk about the broad strokes before the actual expansion launches on November 28.\nHere's a quick rundown of the pre-Dragonflight expansion patch:\nThe talent system has been revamped, and here's the biggest change: \"Change your talents anywhere, for free. Switching talents no longer requires being in a rested area or using tomes. However, you can’t change talents during combat, Mythic+ runs, and active PvP matches.\"\nYou can play Mage, Priest, and Rogue classes with all races\nFull UI/HUD customization is in, by default, without the help of mods\nSeason 4 ends this week, with a \"post-season\" lull until the expansion arrives\nAfter all this, the \"second phase\" of the pre-expansion patch will launch on November 15. At that point the Evoker class will be available, as well as a new zone (Forbidden Reach), the Uldaman: Legacy of Tyr dungeon (just in time for the new God of War), and the typical pre-expansion in-game events.\nShadowlands, the current WoW expansion, had a number of things working against it. A lot of the playerbase was fed up with WoW, fed up with Activision-Blizzard (especially when all this came out)...and of course, it was also at a time when Final Fantasy XIV was really, really good. Maybe Dragonflight can turn things around, leading into the Microsoft aqusition. Or maybe not. With modern Blizzard, you never know what's going to happen.\nIf you want to dig further, you can find the full patch notes here.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXefWvv4-LE\nThe post World of Warcraft just got its massive pre-Dragonflight expansion patch appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Doctor Shmup\nIf you fancy something a lil' cute 'n' weird for your retro fix this week, then you're in luck, as Hamster has reached into the Namco back catalog and pulled out one of the developer's few horizontally scrolling shmups, the totes adorbs Ordyne, now available on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.\nReleased to Japanese arcades in 1988 and capitalizing on the high-color, high-goofball attraction of Konami's Parodius, Ordyne sees a highly intelligent professor, Dr. Tomari, take to the skies in order to rescue his kidnapped sweetheart Kana, who has been abducted by his rival, Dr. Kubata. Accompanying the good Doctor on his quest is loyal sidekick Sunday Chin. SUNDAY CHIN. What follows is action exceptionally similar to Gradius/Parodius, with familiar enemy patterns, pacing, and power-ups. Still, the Konami titles are sound examples of the genre, and thus, so is Ordyne.\nCheck out the colorful action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber Were1974.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHIWgljPGQ\nAs they battle through each stage, Tomari and Chin can gather crystals mid-flight, to be spent at a series of anti-gravity stores, run by a typical doe-eyed anime gal. Much like Sega's Fantasy Zone, our heroes can then purchase speed boosts, extra lives, shields, and many other items in order to give the duo the edge in battle. Oddly, the weapons are time-limited, meaning that you'll only maintain that edge for so long before returning to your default form. What kinda shop offers that service?\nOrdyne would eventually receive a port on the PC Engine — a form that would eventually see the game head west for the first time ever. It hasn't featured on all that many Namco compilations over the years, so remains something of an oddity even today. If you'd like to get your wings on in on a bright-eyed rescue mission, then Ordyne is available to download now on PS4 and Switch, priced at around $8.\nThe post Cutesy Namco shmup Ordyne takes flight on Arcade Archives appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "This NSFW cat-themed roguelike is \"hopefully\" coming in 2024\nThe Binding of Isaac is renowned as one of the most influential indie games of all time, and I personally believe it helped usher in the wave of awesome roguelikes that have come out in its wake. The game was created by a teeny tiny team, but the whole project was the brainchild of Edmund McMillen, who also created Super Meat Boy, another indie classic. His new game, Mewgenics, has been in the works for over a decade now, but for the first time in years, we finally have an update on the title -- or more specifically, an actual release window.\nMewgenics is a \"turn-based legacy roguelike draft sim about cats,\" according to the game's Steam page, and will allow players to \"hoard, breed, train, and set cats out on epic adventures through a sprawling world of complete chaos.\" The release window is currently listed as \"sometime in 2024 (hopefully),\" and while that's a while to wait, it's just nice to know that the game is still coming out at all. It also looks like it's going to have the same dark, twisted sense of humor that McMillen is known for. I mean, just look at this gif he posted as the announcement of the Steam page going live:\nhttps://twitter.com/edmundmcmillen/status/1586047233715101696\nOther features of the game listed on the Steam page include \"100s of hours of gameplay,\" \"6+ classes, each with 50+ unique abilities to draft from,\" \"200+ enemies and bosses that will upset your mom,\" and many more. We already know that McMillen has an eye for some of the most engaging gameplay out there, and Mewgenics looks like it's shaping up to be his most complex project yet. I know I'm pumped to give it a try when it drops eventually, and it'll be interesting to see how the creator's design sensibilities have evolved over time.\nThe post Mewgenics, the new game from the Binding of Isaac creator, has a release window appeared first on Destructoid.",

The news was announced through a blog post on the Spry Fox website, which also answers some questions about the future of the studio.\nSpry Fox says the partnership will not change any of their upcoming plans, meaning that Cozy Grove 2 and their unnamed non-violent MMO will still be developed as planned. Instead, Netflix will provide them with financial support, which Spry Fox says will allow them to “stop stressing” about how their games will generate profit. Despite all of Netflix’s current games existing through their mobile app, the blog post does not mention anything about platform exclusivity.\nSpry Fox joins five other in-house game developers at Netflix: Next Games (Stranger Things: Puzzle Tales), Night School Studio (Oxenfree), Boss Fight Entertainment (Dungeon Boss), and two internal studios in Helsinki, Finland and southern California.\nNetflix launched its games collection just over a year ago, in November of 2021. Currently, subscribers can play over 30 games on their mobile app, including Into the Breach, Spiritfarer, and Poinpy. On top of that, Netflix has over 50 more games in development.

          "description": "When Electronic Arts' Motive Studios announced its Iron Man game in September, we learned it would be the first of a multi-game deal between the publisher and Marvel. That was a vaguely defined arrangement at the time, but we now know the partnership will produce a minimum of three titles.\nEA announced the news in a press release, with the publisher describing it as a “long-term” deal that could extend beyond three games based on the wording. The release also specifies these titles will be action-adventure games for consoles and PC, each featuring original stories in the Marvel universe. \nIt's worth clarifying that EA is not getting exclusive rights to Marvel like it had with Star Wars. There are multiple Marvel games in the works at various studios, including the recently announced Captain America/Black Panther game from Amy Hennig’s Skydance New Media. \n“We have been long-time fans of Marvel and their impressive leadership, so this is a remarkable moment for our developers as well as our players and fans,” said EA COO Laura Miele. “We look forward to welcoming Marvel into the EA family of creators and know this collaboration will produce exceptional experiences for our players. We can’t wait to see players' reactions when they suit up as Iron Man and do the extraordinary things this Super Hero is known for.”\nWe’re curious to learn what other Marvel projects are on the docket and which EA studios are behind them. Motive’s Iron Man, a single-player third-person action game, is currently in pre-production, so it’s a long way from release (the team is also making the Dead Space remake).

The wacky cat-breeding roguelike is the brainchild of Super Meat Boy co-creator and The Binding of Isaac mastermind Edmund McMillen and has been in and out of the works for a decade. After being announced, put on hold, and restarted, it appears to have a new release window. \nMcMillen tweeted a gif of two of the game’s adorable cats engaging in what we'll call an intimate cat exercise. The tweet links to the game’s Steam page, which lists a 2024 release window.\nHold on to your Butts!https://t.co/wDBOizNXGl pic.twitter.com/MESXJFFXsh\nOctober 28, 2022\nWhat the heck is Mewgenics? The game tasks players with collecting and breeding hundreds of cats to train and send into battle. Or, as the Steam description puts it, Mewgenics is a “turn-based legacy roguelike draft sim about cats!” The game apparently boasts “100s of hours” of gameplay, multiple classes with over 50 unique abilities, over 200 enemies, and other features. \nMewgenics was first announced in 2012, with McMillen at the time describing it as \"By far the strangest project I've ever worked on.” McMillen has worked on it alongside Tyler Glaiel; the pair previously partnered for The End is Nigh, among other titles. The game was originally billed as a cross between Pokémon, The Sims, and Animal Crossing, and had first been planned to release in 2014. It was, of course, delayed, and its development was put on indefinite hold in 2016 when McMillen began work on The Legend of Bum-Bo, which launched in 2019. At the time, McMillen was unsure of Mewgenics’ future, but in 2018 he announced he was remaking the game to be released in “a few years.” \nThe game is slated to launch for PC, though whether or not it’s still coming to iOS is unknown.

Silver Tempest stars Alolan Vulpix on the key art, but monsters like Lugia, Serperior, Ho-Oh, and Mawile share the spotlight. Meanwhile, players can expect cards starring Regieleki and Regidrago.\nThe Pokémon Company sent us several booster packs so we could open them and see what we pull. While it may just be dumb luck, I feel like this expansion gave me better pulls than any others in recent memory. As I cracked these open, I was met with several attractive full-art cards, as well as some gorgeous Trainer Gallery cards. I even managed to pull two of the three new Radiant Pokémon cards. \nThis expansion adds over 190 cards to the ever-growing library of Pokémon cards. That number includes 6 Pokémon VSTAR cards, 15 Pokémon V cards, 1 Pokémon VMAX card, 30 special art Trainer Gallery cards, and more than 15 Trainer cards. You can see my favorite pulls from this expansion below.\n\nPokémon Trading Card Game: Sword and Shield – Silver Tempest launches on November 11. For all things Pokémon Trading Card Game, head to our special hub by clicking on the banner below!",

We respected her,\" confirming her death. \nSega has since confirmed Kodama's death, citing that she had passed in May, according to IGN. Further details around her death will not be shared out of respect for her family's privacy, Sega says. \n\"We pray that the deceased will rest in peace, and we offer our gratitude for her enormous contributions to Sega,\" Sega of Japan says, as translated by IGN Japan. \nKodama's journey through game development began in the 1980s when she started as a graphic designer for Master System and Sega Genesis games like Altered Beast and Sonic the Hedgehog. She was the main artist for Phantasy Star and continued to work on the series' visuals team until Phantasy Star IV: The End of the Millennium, which she directed.\nOther credits include Mega Drive versions of Sorcerian, Alex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, and more. After directing Phantasy Star IV, she directed Magic Knight Rayearth in 1995 before becoming a producer and development lead on Sega's Skies of Arcadia. She continued to work in games development in some capacity until at least 2018, where she was the lead producer on the Sega compilation title Sega Ages. \nIn 2019, she was recognized with the Pioneer Award at GDC 2019. \nThe staff at Game Informer extends their condolences to Kodama's family.",

Spawned in 2007 by Capcom veterans, including Resident Evil creator Shinji Mikami and Devil May Cry and Okami mastermind Hideki Kamiya, the studio became a haven for these minds to create new franchises under the freedom of independence. Early success like MadWorld turned heads, but Platinum’s third title, Bayonetta, cemented it as one of the game industry’s premier action studios.\nLaunching in Japan in 2009 and hitting U.S. shores in 2010, Bayonetta revamped and, in some ways, improved the stylish action of its spiritual predecessor, Devil May Cry. The bewitching adventure reinvented and reinvigorated the stylish action genre; Platinum created its magnum opus in only two years. Unfortunately, sales didn’t match the reception, and Sega, the game’s original publisher, passed on a sequel. Despite fans’ cries, Bayonetta seemingly ended the series before it could take off.\nNintendo stepped up to answer those pleas by agreeing to publish a follow-up. Bayonetta 2 arrived in 2014 as a Wii U exclusive. The sequel proved Bayonetta wasn’t a one-hit wonder, becoming one of the year’s best games with some fans believing it surpassed its predecessor. The success also proved the family-friendly Nintendo had no problem letting the franchise remain true to its Mature-rated self.\nRead more...",

Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. You can also catch up on previous episodes by visiting our new Game Informer Shows YouTube channel or watching the embedded video below. \nMetal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. \n\n\nJoin me, Marcus Stewart, as I revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure.

          "description": "Warner Bros. Games has announced Mortal Kombat: Onslaught, a mobile-exclusive Mortal Kombat experience. The game is described as a collection role-playing game where players build a roster of fighters from the Mortal Kombat universe and “unleash them in massive real-time group battles.” It’s more than just battles, though – Onslaught is also said to feature a cinematic story experience where fighters have to defeat a “dark and dangerous threat.”\nThis is not the first time Mortal Kombat has appeared on a mobile device. Mortal Kombat Mobile was released in 2015 alongside Mortal Kombat X and eventually adapted characters and features from Mortal Kombat 11 as well. Mortal Kombat Mobile has been downloaded over 150 million times since its launch, so it’s no wonder WB Games wants to release more games from the franchise.\nOctober 8 marked the series’ 30th anniversary, and Mortal Kombat: Onslaught seems to be a celebration of that. Not only is it the newest mobile game in the series, but it’s also the most recent title since the release of Mortal Kombat 11 Ultimate in 2020. As far as the future of the series is concerned outside of the mobile market, Netherrealm has been pretty quiet lately.

          "description": "Are you spooked? We are too with this spooky release date, even if nothing in OpenTTD itself is spooky. Luckily, I can offer you the first testing release of the 13.X release series. We collected whatever we could find on the cutting room floor to get you a Halloween release. Some of the higlights of this release include: Build NewGRF objects over an era with click-and-drag. Wider rivers on map generation. Improved handling of HiDPI and mixed-DPI screens. Some more GUI improvements like a cleaned up finance window. Many bug-fixes (over 50 of them), tweaks, changes, and other additions. (As ever, see the changelog for further details). The usual titlegame competition has been announced on the forums. See the page for the exact competition rules if you are interested. Download Changelog Bug tracker",
