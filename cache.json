          "description": "Smooth operator.\nSince the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One launched in 2013, gamers have increasingly been given the option to tweak their experiences based on whether they prefer higher image quality or smoother performance.\nNot all developers offer this, but now that we're more than three-and-a-half years into the lifespan of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, player expectations have adjusted accordingly to the point where it almost feels mandatory to include 'Quality' and 'Performance' options in the biggest games on those platforms. It's why you see almost constant requests for a re-release of Bloodborne, a game that is infamously capped at 30fps on PS4, with Rockstar's Red Dead Redemption 2 being a close second.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

In even more recent years, we have seen the same happen for 'Pokémon-likes'. Naturally, each genre has its respective highs and lows, but rarely have we seen both of them joined by the same game. That is, until we saw Dicefolk.\nDicefolk is a tactical roguelike. It's also a monster catcher. It's also a dice game. It's a confusing combination of genres that seem disparate on paper but click in practice. The game launched on Steam earlier this year and quickly started racking up positive reviews. So, when developers LEAP Game Studios (Tunche) and Tiny Ghoul announced that the monster-based mashup would be rolling the dice on Switch on 20th June, our interests were quickly piqued.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It’s a vaguely Slay The Spire-ish roguelite where you grab weapons from a claw machine while you fight. It's got lazy Steam Deck depression nap written all over it. The main theme reminds me of Zombies Ate My Neighbors, and the character I picked is named Sir Bunalot.\n \nRead more",

Whereas CES splits its focus across tech, cars, and the occasional overdesigned white good, Computex is all computing, all the time, making it a prime source of reveals and showcases for the hardware bits that make games happen.\nSadly, Computex 2024 is unlikely to go down as a classic, largely because this year’s show has been mesmerised by AI and the most tedious applications thereof: search, but different somehow! Run art-stealing generation tools faster! Oh, Computex, what have they done to you, and why do you have seven fingers on one hand?\nGranted, AI is a broad field, and not everything about it is necessarily gross or creatively bankrupting. But it also doesn’t deserve to overshadow all the other useful, unexpected, and curiosity-piquing gaming tech that Computex has to offer, from new Steam Deck alternatives to resurrected CPU lineups and promising graphics card updates. Here are those highlights of the show so far...\nRead more",

Sorry, did I say ‘worthwhile art’? I meant to say “lots of money.” Let’s get clicking!\nFirst up, I need to name my studio (I settle on Horace's Revenge) as well as my crack new team of business bastards. There’s my chief legal officer, Jebediah End. My CCO, Anne Egg, and CFO, Rummy McLastdrink. He doesn’t have a sauce problem, because obviously I wouldn’t put him in charge of money if he did. In the wreckage of the studio, we find an unedited film reel hidden in the waffles n’ cocaine cupboard. It’s a noir thriller named ‘Messenger Of Death’. Whatever influential critic is currently directing this era’s discourse has chosen to categorise each film as genre percentages (‘60% detective/40% thriller’), and setting (‘modern American city’.)

Seriously, me and the boys used to roam the streets of Bradford looking for F-Zero players to bully, at least till the RollCagers rocked up and stole our lunch money. Mind you, I think I was probably less interested in WipeoUt's racing than its trackside landscapes, which remain exquisite decades on - all those sweeping album-cover facades with their animate fixtures that thickened and solidified into full-blown peripheral cities as the series progressed. \r\n\n\r\nI am similarly hooked by the worlds of Ghosts Ehf's Phantom Spark, which are a million lightyears from WiPeout in terms of their influences and atmosphere, much as the underlying hover-jockeying is a million lightyears away from WipeouT in terms of its gentleness and lack of combative elements. But these spaces are just as mesmerising to fly through and think about when not focussed on finding the perfect line through the next corner, or avoiding a patch of grass. Small wonder, given that the game's art director is Joost Eggermont, whose streaking astral contraptions and \"small interactive moments\" I've long admired, but never managed to write about until now.\r\n \nRead more",

Not just a bottomless pit, but a conveniently portable, Looney Tunes-esque hole into which you could seemingly chuck everything from items and equipment to characters. Speaking to me during the same interview in which they discussed long-abandoned plans for bringing back Baldur’s Gate 1’s Candlekeep, Larian CEO Swen Vincke and Baldur’s Gate 3 lead writer Adam Smith (RPS in peace) touched on the subject with tantalising brevity. Argh, if only I hadn’t had to run off and catch a taxi, I’d still be there now, discussing the many applications of a portable hole. Bypassing carrying capacity limits would just be the start of it.\n Read more",

It's a creative building game like The Sims 4 but with none of the fuss of actually controlling lives - and no quests, combat or arbitrary challenges of any kind.\r\n\r\nInstead, Tiny Glade simply offers a meadow and tools with which to build. The vibe of the game is cottage-core at its finest, with enough whimsigoth finery that you'll soon lament that you can't actually live inside your glorious creations. I've played the charming demo as part of Steam Next Fest, and you'll find some thoughts from my time with it below.\n Read more",

The mechanical monster is jury-rigged to the top of an office desk and must be reloaded with a new shell after every shot. The recoil is terrifying. It's operated by three people: one person drives the tank with a steering wheel and levers, another uses cranks to aim the gun barrel, and a third reloads the shells that eject automatically from the chamber after every desk-lifting blast. The \"shells\" in question are 2-litre bottles of fizzy drink, and the crew has set up a whole rack of these bottles for panicked reloading. If you are the kind of person who yearns for the immersion of the legendary Steel Battalion controller then you will get a definite buzz from watching the death machine in action below. \nRead more",

We also got a look at some cursed lions, an armoured frog with an unsettling tongue and a rideable Chocobo-esque mount that lets you ping arrows on the fly.

Freegunners, meanwhile, are lairy Guardians Of The Galaxy-alike mercenaries with phat guns and playstyle-defining secondary abilities. They do not consume hummus as far as I know.

Lively tactics Trash Of The Titans does not aim to emancipate its villainous vermin. But, like Warhammer, it gets a pass for its evident affection towards its antagonistic dumpster diving scuttlers.

Zelnick refused to acknowledge that the studio was being closed when asked by a reporter, even going so far as to claim the opposite. \"We didn't shutter those studios,\" he told IGN.

          "description": "To kick off with some extremely half-arsed mytho-geometry, the original Frostpunk was a testament to both the design utility and the inexhaustible political symbolism of circles. When people wish to found a community of equals they commonly form a circle, with each participant visible and audible to the rest. A circle is also the best shape for defending against an engulfing ambient threat such as a global ice age, because it has no weak points, and it makes a great centrepiece for a videogame interface, a symmetrical motif that can be tuned and adorned to either suck your attention into the screen or distribute it evenly in all directions.\nCreated by Polish developers 11 bit, Frostpunk takes place in the middle of a circle, an Arctic crater with a huge coal generator at its heart. Your city rises in rings around that generator, each additional layer of dwellings corresponding intuitively to decreasing temperature, and the result is one of the most focused and thematically consistent specimens of its genre - a building game that feels as intimate and urgent as tending a campfire. Frostpunk 2's new campaign mode breaks the circle open. It starts where you (hopefully) ended, with the crater now fully colonised and evolved into a glaring, blue-orange geode of high-density housing and clustered chimneys. But the view has been pulled back, and construction now unfolds along the plains and canyons beyond the crater, which consist not of circles but of hexagons - another UI designer's favourite - on which you'll plot out upgradeable districts rather than assembling individual buildings. \r\n \nRead more",

The captivating, combat-free Metroidvania is rich with a delectable buffet of challenges, puzzles and secrets to find even once you’ve seen the credits roll. Still, players have chewed their way through its more-ish platforming and puzzle-solving much faster than its solo developer intended, it turns out. Luckily for us all, creator Billy Basso is already looking ahead to a new game set in the moody zoo-niverse - even if that’s not a complete sequel.\nRead more",

Anyway, the latest game to put a hinge-disrespecting protagonist front and center is also my current obsession: the excellent Post Void/Hotline Miami-type beat, Mullet Mad Jack.

I can ask that in earnest because Playtonic Games' 3D collect 'em up platformer is seven years old now, practically a dinosaur in Internet Years. This particular reptile is coming back, bat in tow, with a remastered and enhanced version called Yooka-Replaylee. \n\n\nThe updated version of Yooka-Laylee was revealed during the Guerilla Collective showcase along with a bunch of indie announcements and trailers. The Yooka-Replaylee footage shows some side-by-side looks at the new visual flourishes, which appear to be pretty substantial. \n\n\n\n\nBeyond the new look, the team improved some of the games challenges while adding new ones for players to discover. There's also a new collectible currency thanks to Capital B's minions dropping their coins all over the place. You can spend this hard-found loot at the sentient vending machine known as Vendi, who hooks Yooka and Laylee up with Tonics in exchange for completing objectives. Other enhancements include a new world map, which helps you track challenges and plan your next moves, and some new tonic flavors for further playstyle customization. \n\n\nFinally, Yooka-Replaylee sports updates to the controls and camera — making it easier to both position the camera and pull off move combos — as well as a new orchestral arrangement of Grant Kirkhope and David Wise's original soundtrack. Right now it's just listed for consoles and PC with no release date in place, but the Steam page is live with more screens, info, and a brief FAQ. \n\nThe post Yooka-Laylee returns with updated visuals and more as Yooka-Replaylee appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Several EA FC 24 players claimed that matchmaking isn't working properly in Ultimate Team Division Rivals, meaning players from the top divisions can match with players who just started the game mode. \n\n\nEA FC 24 content creator MattHDGamer asked other players if they were experiencing \"broken\" matchmaking. The streamer posted a screenshot from a Division Rivals match with a 22-0 scoreline, indicating that he must have played an opponent ranked several divisions lower. \n\n\n\n\nEA FC 24 News substantiated the claim by posting an image of an opponent using a squad of gold players, with the highest rating being an 89 overall player. Since this title has been out for around eight months, most high-level players in Ultimate Team have an Ultimate Team full of special cards, with some being 95 overall or higher. \n\n\nIf you are skilled at EA FC 24, a full gold squad can take down a starting 11 full of special cards. However, for new users just starting in the game mode, getting thrown into the deep end against a Division 1 player could be a rude awakening. For reference, Division Rivals in Ultimate Team divides everyone into 11 different divisions. Earning a higher rank requires winning multiple games in a row, and the competition gets harder each step along the way. \n\n\nUsually, players face squads in the same division or relatively close to them. With matchmaking potentially broken, this could be an issue as matches could continue to result in unrealistic or unfair outcomes. This could also be a good teaching moment for the community as going up against higher-level opposition forces you to improve. Either way, EA has yet to release an official statement, meaning this could stick around for a while until it gets sorted out.\n\nThe post EA allegedly turned off skill-based matchmaking in EA FC 24 Ultimate Team appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Spiderbots are widely considered the most annoying ability to deal with in XDefiant. Fortunately, there is a simple trick to taking out the pesky robots. \n\n\nEvery Faction in XDefiant has unique abilities that set them apart. The DedSec faction was designed to mess with the enemy team by disrupting and taking control of their devices. Hijack is a powerful ability as it allows players to gain the power to hack enemy abilities and gain control of them. However, most players use Spiderbot as it's a robot that chases after the nearest enemy, latches onto their face, and stuns them. \n\n\nMost XDefiant players can at least recall one time when they fell victim to this ability, and there aren't many ways to counter it. However, there are a few options available so not all hope is lost. \n\n\nHow to counter DedSec Faction Spiderbots in XDefiant\n\n\n\n\nXDefiant Updates posted a clip on Twitter of a player getting attacked by a Spiderbot and voiced their displeasure with the ability. A player claimed that they were able to punch a Spiderbot in mid-air to destroy it one time, but it didn't work again. \n\n\nXDefiant executive producer Mark Rubin confirmed that this is a bug and players should be able to punch Spiderbots. In the meantime, the only two ways to counter the ability are to either shoot them, which is extremely difficult, or to aim down when it's on your face and shoot. Both options aren't the best in terms of staying focused on your surroundings, but for now it's the only chance we have at countering the ability. \n\nThe post How to destroy Spiderbots in XDefiant appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Daniel Brühl, known for portraying Baron Zemo in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, says he is “very confident” that he will reprise his role once again. The actor’s last appearance in the MCU was in The Falcon and the Winter Soldier.\n\n\nBrühl told Screen Rant in a recent interview that he is a “very patient man” and he is willing to wait until Marvel finds a way to bring him back on screen. “I just wrapped on a show that's called The Franchise, where it's actually a satire about the superhero universe, so it was fun to switch sides, so to say. But knowing Marvel, they have a lot of sense of humour, so they will probably find it as funny as I did. And who knows, I mean, I'm still not dead, I'm very confident that I'll be back,” Brühl said.\n\n\n\n\nZemo was the main antagonist in Captain America: Civil War, and can be fairly attributed for breaking up the Avengers, particularly denting the relationship between Tony Stark (Iron Man) and Steve Rogers (Captain America). The effects of Civil War were felt in Avengers: Infinity War when Thanos attacked Earth where some Avengers had not seen each other for years.\n\n\nOnce a villain, Zemo soon turned into an ally for Falcon and Winter Soldier in the show and is still alive in the MCU. It is entirely possible for Zemo to return, and it is likely that we may see him in the Thunderbolts* movie coming in 2025. It has been rather surprising that Daniel Brühl has not been officially cast for the movie, considering the fact that it is actually Baron Zemo who leads the team of misfits in the comics.\n\n\nIt’s tough to guess if Zemo will appear in Thunderbolts* or not, but the actor is certainly interested and even if Zemo might not have a major role, a cameo is still on the cards. Thunderbolts* will be released on May 2, 2025.\n\nThe post MCU actor Daniel Brühl is ‘very confident’ he will return as Zemo appeared first on Destructoid.",

I was certain I hadn't seen it before and didn’t recognize the art style, but there was something familiar. Then the Wild Gentlemen logo flashed on screen, and I knew. This is a Chicken Police spin-off.\n\n\n\n\nChicken Police is something that I always hover around. I named the next mainline game in the series, Chicken Police: Into the Hive my most anticipated game of 2024. What draws me to these games is the obvious passion behind their world-building. It doesn’t necessarily matter what form the games take, but that storytelling is just delectable. I’d make a finger-lickin’ reference there, but I’ve done that enough in other articles.\n\n\nWhile the trailer for W.I.L.D. Tactics is entirely a flashy animated teaser with no gameplay, screenshots and information have arrived elsewhere. It’s a turn-based strategy game made in the vein of XCOM but with the series’ noir stylings and anthropomorphic characters. It promises 15 story-focused missions that range from stealth to all-out assault, and 12 characters to carry them out.\n\n\nWhile press material pushes the “story-focused” angle, there is squad and base management, upgrades, and a social system between the characters to keep things dynamic. \n\n\nThey had me at “World of Wilderness.”\n\n\nW.I.L.D. Tactics currently doesn’t have a release window, but will be coming to PC. Other platforms will be announced later.\n\nThe post Nobody warned me about Chicken Police spin-off W.I.L.D.

You can easily do this on the Pokémon Rewards page, which only takes a few minutes to set up.\n\n\nAfter you've connected the two accounts, you'll need to tune in to a special event. The Pokémon Go Twitter/X page typically notifies users when an event is active. At the time of writing, a Twitch Drops event will kick off for the 2024 Pokémon North America International Championship.\n\n\nImage via Niantic\n\n\nDuring this time, trainers can watch the Pokémon Go broadcast from June 7 to June 9. Anyone who watches 30 minutes of the stream will be rewarded with an exclusive Time Research. This will allow you to catch MEWeedle's Altaria, the Europe International Championship winner.\n\n\nFor specific times, you can expect the following events for the Pokémon Go stream (all times are set to PT):\n\n\n\nBracket Play: June 7 from 6 a.m. to 4 p.m.\n\n\nBracket Play until Top 3: June 8 from 6 a.m. to 4 p.m.\n\n\nFinals: June 9 at 6 a.m.\n\n\n\nBesides the Altaria, players can earn more rewards from this broadcast, including TMs and Stardust. However, it may require additional stream time beyond the 30-minute range.\n\n\nTrainers can claim the Twitch Drops via the Rewards page.

It looks pretty good from the demo video and has pretty good stats, so if you want to know more before taking it on a mission, here’s everything you need to know.\n\n\nHow to get the Tesla Tower in Helldivers 2\n\n\nTo get the Tesla Tower in Helldivers 2, you will need to be level 15 and spend 8,000 Req Slips. It’s part of the Bridge section in the Stratagem Management menu.\n\n\nOnce purchased, you can then equip it before shipping out on your mission.\n\n\nHow to use the Tesla Tower in Helldivers 2\n\n\nTo use the Tesla Tower, you will call it down like any other turret. Once it lands, you can’t move it. \n\n\nUnlike other turrets where you can see where it’ll attack next, the Tesla Tower attacks enemies within its shock radius. You can see roughly how far it’ll attack, so you ideally want to stay away before you end up dead. You can go prone to avoid getting hurt or killed, but it’s best to just be away from the Tower’s radius entirely.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nIs the Tesla Tower worth using?\n\n\nThe Tesla Tower is only worth using at lower difficulties fighting Terminids in Helldivers 2. It’s amazing when it can take down small and medium enemies, but once you start facing heavier targets like Bile Spewers, Chargers, and Bile Titans, it’s nearly worthless.\n\n\nMost heavier enemies can walk through the Tower’s radius and crush it before it can deal significant damage.\n\n\nAlso, the Tesla Tower is nearly useless when fighting Automatons. A majority of the attacks this faction has are all ranged, so they can easily take this down from afar. \n\n\nSo, if you want to farm low-level defense missions for quick Medals and Req slips, the Tesla Tower will be good there. Otherwise, at higher levels, like 5-Hard and higher, it’s going to be destroyed in seconds.\n\nThe post Helldivers 2 Tesla Tower: Is it worth using?

          "description": "HBO’s The Last Of Us Season 2 episode count has been revealed by co-showrunners Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann. The duo told Deadline in a recent review that The Last Of Us Season 2 will have seven episodes. This may come across as slightly upsetting news, given that Season 1 consisted of nine episodes.\n\n\nSeason 2 will be seven episodes\n\n\nHowever, the co-showrunners have said that one of the episodes in the upcoming season will be “quite big” in terms of duration, which does offer some form of relief for fans. Craig Mazin explained the logic behind the decision, stating that the story material from The Last of Us Part II videogame is more than what was presented to the team for the first game. So, the team had to “figure out how to tell that story across seasons”, which points towards a potential third season to complete the story of the second game.\n\n\n“When you do that, you look for natural breakpoints, and as we laid it out, this season, the national breakpoint felt like it came after seven episodes,” added Mazin. The co-creator later on said something during the interview, that almost does confirm that a third season will arrive. “One thing is absolutely for sure, I don’t see how we could tell the story that remains after Season 2 is complete in one more season,” he said.\n\n\nFrom the looks of it, Season 2 will have fewer episodes but there will be another season to look forward to. While it is up for debate where exactly Season 2 will leave the story, there is one particular event from the game that seems to be the obvious choice, but let’s keep conversations about Season 2 spoiler-free for now.\n\nThe post The Last Of Us Season 2 episode count revealed, third season almost confirmed appeared first on Destructoid.",

To even get that much to hold at once, you also need to be max rank with them or Exalted.\n\n\nIf you aren’t allied with them when you chose your Syndicate, you have to resort to trading with another player who is.

Revealed during today's Guerrilla Collective showcase, Arena is a prequel to Kiborg and it's coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (via Steam) sometime this summer. \nIn the full game – Kiborg – players must fend of waves of foes as Morgan Lee, the leader of a ragtag group of resistance fighters on the prison planet of Sigma. \"Strike with punishing hand-to-hand combat skills, blast mechanized soldiers with firearms, and deploy cybernetic-enhanced abilities to devastate bloodthirsty baddies. Learn to dodge, block, and parry adversaries to set them up for the killing blow.\" It sounds and, given how it appears in the trailer below, looks a lot like Sifu, which is a great combat-centric brawler from 2022. \nCheck out the Kiborg action in the trailer below:\n\n\nIn Arena, players find \"Morgan Lee, who sends the clones that fight on his behalf out on missions, fighting in Sigma's Colisseum. Here, Morgan's clones will square off in bloody battles against other denizens of the prison planet for the cash to help keep his resistance going.\" Arena also features an Endless Mode, which Sobaka says spawns an infinite amount of increasingly difficult enemies to overcome.\nIn the full game, players will gather resources to unlock permanent upgrades, form alliances, and research forbidden technologies to gain the upper hand. \nHere are some Kiborg screenshots: \n\nArena launches this summer on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

Now, thanks to a new PlayStation Blog post detailing the game's preorder contents, we know it will cost $39.99. \nThat same blog post says Concord will launch with 16 playable characters known as Freerunners, 12 unique maps set on various in-universe worlds, and six distinct team-based modes. And that content will \"expand shortly after launch with regular, post-launch updates\" for all players at no additional cost. \nHere's a look at the Concord box art: \nAlongside the standard $39.99 edition of the game, PlayStation and Firewalk are releasing a Digital Deluxe Edition for $59.99 that includes additional cosmetics to customize your Freegunners and 72-hours early access to the game's August launch. Preordering the game, regardless of edition, also gets you (and up to four friends) beta access and the Monarch cosmetics pack. \nHere's a look at the Concord Digital Deluxe Edition: \n\"Seeing Vale and other Freegunners in action in gameplay footage is one thing, but there's no substitute for experiencing the game for yourself,\" the blog post reads. \"That's why we're hosting a pre-launch beta, simultaneously on PS5 and PC with cross-play support. Those that pre-order will have an opportunity to be among the first to play Concord.\" \nThat beta is set to happen this July before Concord launches on PS5 and PC on August 23. \nFor more, watch the Concord reveal here. \nHow do you feel about Concord's price point?

The threequel to the hit animated films is being produced by Rovio Entertainment, creators of the Angry Birds franchise, in collaboration with Sega and Prime Focus Studios.\nRed and Chuck are back, with Jason Sudeikis and Josh Gad reprising their roles, respectively. It will be directed by John Rice (The Angry Birds Movie 2, Beavis and Butt-Head Do the Universe) with a screenplay written by Thurop Van Orman (The Angry Birds Movie 2, Adventure Time, The Misadventures of Flapjack).

Prime Focus Studios, which co-produced The Garfield Movie, is set to produce. \nA press release provides no details on the plot nor a release window.

And both games are great; read why in Game Informer's Octopath Traveler review and Game Informer's Octopath Traveler II review. \n\n\nTo celebrate the series being available on all current platforms and PC (via Steam and Windows), developer Team Asano has released a free update to Octopath Traveler II that includes an \"Extra Battle\" mode that becomes available after defeating the game's final boss. In this mode, players can test their skills against newly added extra-tough opponents – including the main characters from the first game. This mode has been available on Xbox consoles since launch but is now available on PlayStation, Switch, and PC. \n\"Since its launch in 2018 with Octopath Traveler, the Octopath Traveler series has sold over four million copies worldwide, popularizing the unique HD-2D art style: a striking blend of 2D character designs in beautiful 3D worlds,\" a press release reads. \"Both games are a standalone experience set in different worlds with eight distinct protagonists, each with their own stories to explore and Path Actions to use.

New expansions are always a fun time, especially for high-end raiders who will be getting shiny new buttons to press, and with that comes new rotations. After approximately 8,000 hours of playing Final Fantasy XIV and clearing The Omega Protocol on release, I think I'm able to provide some insight about the new weaponskills, spells, and abilities (and their implications for rotations, openers, and general play) I saw at a recent preview event for its upcoming Dawntrail expansion.

          "description": "The Last of Us Season 2 is on the way but it won’t be last for the series, nor will it cover the entirety of the sequel it's adapting. A new interview with Deadline reveals the season’s 7-episode count, the likelihood of a third and even fourth season, and how the showrunners plan on telling its story.\nThe Last of Us Part II is a long game. So much so that showrunners and directors Craig Mazin and Naughty Dog president Neil Druckmann realized it would need to tell its story across more than one season. \n“The story material that we got from Part II of the game is way more than the story material that was in the first game, so part of what we had to do from the start was figure out how to tell that story across seasons,” Mazin said. “When you do that, you look for natural breakpoints, and as we laid it out, this season, the natural breakpoint felt like it came after seven episodes.”\nEven though Season 2 will be shorter than Season 1, one of its episodes is said to be \"quite big\" in length. The showrunners also tease that a potential Season 3 will be much larger in scope. Despite this, Mazin doesn’t believe they can tell the whole story in two seasons because they want to take their time. “And indeed, the story may require Season 4,” he says.\nHBO has not yet renewed The Last of Us for a third or fourth season, but Mazin believes it will happen, “as long as people keep watching.” \nFor those worried that Season 2 would rush through Part II's events, it seems you can relax. We'll see where the story stops when The Last of Us Season 2 kicks off in 2025. To get a look at what the season has in store, you can take your first looks at Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey’s Joel and Ellie, and read about the castings for Dina, along with Manny, Mel, Owen, and Nora. Actor Jeffrey Wright was recently cast to reprise his role as Isaac.\n[Source: Deadline]",

The game sees players building squads of classic Metal Slug characters, each with unique loadouts of recognizable series weapons, to take on signature villains and bosses, like the warship in the video.\n\n\nMetal Slug Tactics is developed by Leikir Studio and is published by Dotemu, the team behind TMNT: Shredder's Revenge. Famed composer Tee Lopes (Shredder's Revenge, Sonic Mania) is developing the game's soundtrack. \nWhen first revealed, Metal Slug Tactics was only slated to launch for Switch and PC.

She’s assisted by the Rot, tiny, adorable spirits Kena can command to aid in puzzle-solving and combat. The game’s design draws inspiration from series such as The Legend of Zelda, while combat has shades of From Software’s Dark Souls. \nKena hits Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One on August 15 for $39.99 and will include exclusive pirate-themed Rot hats, a Golden Rot skin, and a unique staff for Kena. A new physical premium edition will also be available and will consist of these items, a digital soundtrack, and an exclusive sticker sheet. The Xbox version also includes the Anniversary DLC update, which includes the Spirit Guide Trials, additional Kena outfits, and New Game+\n\n\nWe awarded Kena: Bridge of Spirits a 9 out of 10, with former editor-in-chief Andrew Reiner writing in his review, \"Bridge of Spirits stumbles a little in spots, yet confidently sprints into the heart of the adventure, rewarding the player with secrets galore and visuals that are almost always worth admiring.

The open-world game is the latest entry in the Nikki series of fashion games, which is very popular in Asia, and Westerners are getting their biggest exposure to it yet with this charming adventure. \n\n\nThe game unfolds on the magical continent of Miraland, and Nikki must save it. Her main power is \"styling,\" which involves changing clothes from different nations, allowing her to adopt unique abilities. For example, one outfit allows her to float while another cleanses corrupted creatures of demonic energy. The trailer shows one outfit that lets players summon a giant flower to glide through the air. Another ability shrinks her to the size of her small companion, Momo, to access tight areas and other locations. \nThe more outfits you collect, the more abilities Nikki has to solve puzzles and overcome platforming obstacles. But despite the \"save the world\" premise, Infinity Nikki is billed as a relaxing adventure. You can also catch bugs, go fishing, and gather resources to craft new outfits, among other activities. \nInfinity Nikki looks wild, and fans can get their first taste of it in a beta test happening during Q3 of this year. The game is coming to PlayStation 5, PC, iOS, and Android but has no release window.",

In the trailer, we get a few glimpses of some Xenomorphs, the tracking device we'll be using to avoid said Xenomorphs, and a look at some pods that indicate we might be fighting more than one. \nCheck it out for yourself in the Alien: Rogue Incursion gameplay trailer below: \n\n\nIn a new PlayStation Blog post, Survios chief product officer TQ Jefferson explains that Alien: Rogue Incursion was developed from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5. Jefferson also shares that the \"high tension shooter\" tasks players with exploring an \"overrun facility on the inhospitable planet Purdan.\" \n\"Dynamically spawning and pathing with countless unique possibilities, even we couldn't tell you exactly where and when each Xenomorph will strike, let alone what strategies it might use or if it'll bring some friends,\" the blog post reads. \"While heart-pounding combat is the core of Alien: Rogue Incursion, grabbing your pulse rifle and blasting your way out of every situation is not always the best strategy. \n\"Constantly hunted by unpredictable and resourceful Xenomorphs, players will often find creativity and a level head to be their greatest weapons, especially when it comes to leveraging the environment to their advantage.\" \nAlien: Rogue Incursion hits VR this holiday season. \nAre you going to check out Alien: Rogue Incursion later this year?

We received a new trailer for the beloved game alongside the announcement during today's State of Play presentation. \nUntil Dawn puts you in control of eight teenagers/young adults who venture up a mountain for a fun night in a secluded cabin. In typical slasher-movie fashion, there is much more than meets the eye regarding this cabin and its surrounding area. Relying heavily on player choice, Until Dawn's narrative uses a system called the Butterfly Effect, where pivotal choices you make have consequences that go far beyond that which you can immediately recognize. The game stars actors like Rami Malek, Hayden Panettiere, Meaghan Martin, and more.\n\n\nOriginally announced as a full remake of the game, the trailer footage does not appear to be a significant step up in terms of visuals, appearing to be more in line with the industry's definition of a remaster. PlayStation's official description says it's been \"rebuilt and enhanced for PS5 consoles and PC.\" Developed by Ballistic Moon, this improved version also boasts new environments, collectibles, and re-cut narrative sequences. \nWe loved Until Dawn when it arrived on PlayStation 4 in 2015, awarding it a score of 9 out of 10. In the time since Until Dawn's original release, Supermassive has released other games in the genre, including The Dark Pictures Anthology and The Quarry. The studio is currently working on The Casting of Frank Stone, a game set in the Dead by Daylight universe. Until Dawn arrives on PlayStation 5 and PC this fall.",

He also shows off new abilities like donning gloves that fire springs to grab and swing enemies, soaking water like a sponge to grow gigantic, and, best of all, just a random Parappa the Rappa reference (among other PlayStation franchises). It looks delightful, and we want to play it. \n\n\nA PlayStation Blog post also states the game features over 80 levels across 6 galaxies, 20 new abilities, and 70 new enemy types. Astro Bot will be available on PlayStation 5 on September 6.

The Chinese studio describes its project as “Groundbreaking Oriental Wuxia Open World” on its official website.

It revealed this during today's State of Play with a new trailer alongside a September 19 release date. \nThis follows PlayStation's recent trend of bringing its single-player, narrative-driven games over to PC years after they first launch on PlayStation. Just this month, it brought Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut to PC, and today, PlayStation CEO Hermen Hulst revealed all live-service games will launch day-and-date on PS5 and PC while \"tentpole\" single-player games will launch at later dates on PC. \nAs you might expect, the PC version of God of War Ragnarök will feature unlocked frame rates, Nvidia DLSS 3.7. (and AMD FSR 3.1 and Intel XESS 1.3), super ultrawide support, and other PC features. This version of Ragnarök will feature the free Valhalla DLC from last year, too, and pre-purchasing the game gets you in-game rewards like the Kratos Risen Snow Armor and Atreus Risen Snow Tunic. \nCheck it out for yourself below in the God of War Ragnarök PC reveal trailer: \n\n\nAccording to the game's Steam listing, it will require a PlayStation Network account. \nGod of War Ragnarök hits PC on September 19, 2024. \nFor more, read Game Informer's God of War Ragnarök review. \nAre you going to check out this game out on PC later this year?

However, the hero does all of this while carrying a small child on his back.\n\n\nBallad of Antara is billed as an Unreal Engine 5 single-player, free-to-play action RPG starring multiple characters called Emissaries. Each of these characters sports their own class and abilities, as well as a unique story. Players will travel between two worlds seeking out these Emissaries to strengthen your force, but the young girl being carried around is the apparently the key to salvation. A PlayStation Blog post on the game describes your duty to her as such: \"You will help her undo the devastation done to this desolate world through trials, twists, and confrontation, and witness her growth along the way.\"\nIn addition to a single-player story, the game lets up to three players explore together in multiplayer, whether they be close buddies or total strangers wandering the game alongside you. Developer Tipworks also states plans to continually update Ballad of Antara post-launch with new zones, story content, and Emissaries. \nBallad of Antara is coming to PS5, PC, and mobile platforms in 2025.",

          "description": "PlayStation has formally revealed Concord, the first game from Firewalk Studios, which it acquired in 2023, and it brings a healthy (and comedic dose) of sci-fi to the console's 2024 lineup. Concord is both the start of a new sci-fi IP for PlayStation and a five-versus-five-player multiplayer shooter coming to PlayStation 5 and PC this year. \nBefore showcasing some third-person shooter gameplay, a vignette setting up the game's world and tone played, and it's here we get a look at its Guardians of the Galaxy-esque action. We see several characters who appear to make up the rag-tag group of heroes we'll be controlling, each with seemingly unique abilities, attempting to capture a special device from someone attempting to escape a rundown locale called Crater City. \nCheck it out for yourself in the Concord cinematic reveal below: \n\n\nAfter this vignette, PlayStation showcased our first look at Concord's gameplay. We get a look at Vale, a sniper, Lennox, a cowboy-esque revolver shooter, Haymar, who uses a magical bow and arrow, Star Child, a brutish shotgun user, and 1-Off, a support character who appears to use support-type elemental moves. The gameplay looks reminiscent of Destiny 2's PvP modes, although brighter in color and more fantastical in visual design. \nCheck out the Concord gameplay reveal for yourself below:\n\n\nAfter the gameplay, some of the Firewalk developers spoke about what players can expect, including deployable gear that can exist throughout a full game (across multiple rounds) and asymmetrical match-ups between players. While the gameplay only showcased five characters, a quick look at the game's roster revealed several more. \nFirewalk says every week when you log on to Concord, you'll be treated to a short cutscene vignette teaching you more about the characters. \nFirewalk and PlayStation will hold a beta on PS5 and PC this July before the game's simultaneous launch on those platforms on August 23, 2024. \nWhat did you think of this Concord reveal?

          "description": "The PlayStation 5 generation is already Sony's most profitable yet, the company has announced. In terms of numbers, the PS5 generation has already earned Sony $106 billion, according to a slide from its \"Game & Network Services Segment\" presentation from PlayStation's two new CEOs, Hideaki Nishino and Hermen Hulst. \nHowever, on that same slide, Sony shows that the PlayStation 4 generation earned $107 billion, which is obviously more than $106 billion. But, the reason Sony is calling the PS5 generation the most profitable one yet is because the PS4 generation is largely complete whereas the PS5 presumably still has years to go. Given it's made $106 billion in roughly four years, it seems Sony is confident it will surpass $107 billion in the coming months or years. \nAs for what Sony is including in its profits, it's the entire gamut of the PS5 generation. This includes the PS5 console itself, associated hardware and accessories, and software, too. It also includes services, like PlayStation Plus, according to the presentation. \nOne of the reasons the PS5 generation might be Sony's most profitable yet is because even though the playerbase is as big as the PS4 – both are sitting at 49 million active consoles as of last month – PS5 players are playing significantly more on their console. The PS5 generation sits at 2.4 billion total gameplay hours while the PS4 sits at 1.4 billon. More playtime likely equates to more spending, which might be one of the reasons the PS5 generation is doing financially as well as it is. \nLife-to-date spending on the PS5 is also higher amongst players than the PS4, too. Across peripherals, services, content/add-ons, and content/full games, the PS4 life-to-date spend is $580 while PS5 players average $731. \nFor more, read about how the PS5 recently broke a sales record for Sony, and then check out Game Informer's list of the top 10 PS5 games. \nWhat are your thoughts on the PlayStation 5 generation so far?
