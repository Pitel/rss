          "description": "Rocket... Beague???\nEverybody has to have their own, right? Once a breakout game becomes a huge sensation, everyone scrambles to have their own version. PUBG did it for Battle Royales and Overwatch for Hero Shooters; these are a dime a dozen now, with series like Call of Duty and Resident Evil having their own takes of varying quality (or sometimes, multiple takes in CoD’s case). One of these breakout hits was Rocket League, and while not an exact analogue for Rocket League, Roller Champions is Ubisoft’s attempt to scratch that over-the-top sports game itch. Launching in May on PS4, Xbox One, and PC, Ubisoft’s free-to-play skater, Roller Champions has rolled onto the Switch out of nowhere, with a surprise launch on a Tuesday. A pleasant surprise, we hoped, but sadly it’s not looking good.\nRoller Champions is a 3v3 team-based sport ‘em up. Half-roller derby, half-basketball, the basic gist is that teams must gain and stay in possession of the ball, do laps around the arena and score five points by throwing the ball through a ring. Once the opposing team gains possession of the ball, your lap progress is reset and it’s back to square one. One lap equals one point, two laps equal three points, and three laps equal five, the achievement of which ends the match instantly. We really like this lap system; it offers a great risk vs reward formula in which you could play it safe by doing one lap and guaranteeing a point, or risk losing all of your progress to go big.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Ejucashun kan turns a sentinse lik this into something that can be concise and precise, or eloquent and needlessly protracted. From students to heads of state, veterinarians to loquacious video producers — we all could do with a little more of it. SEGA and Two Point Studios know the importance of education, so they invited us down to the Two Point Studios’ HQ to learn a thing or two about their upcoming management sim, Two Point Campus. We got a good working day’s worth of time with it, so how does it hold up? Are we not educated?\nFirst and foremost, this isn’t Two Point Hospital. It bears a lot of the same hallmarks and DNA due to it coming from the same developers and being the same sim genre, but the core loop is definitely not the same. For one thing, the tools at your disposal are even more flexible than ever; gone are the limited buildings and their weird shapes that make room organisation a nightmare, for now you can expand, contract, or reshape any building you desire, or even create new ones, which for Campus’ arguably more complex systems is a huge boon.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Despite being a (relatively) low-poly Nintendo 64 release, the game still manages to convey a sense of wonder, something it does throughout your time with it. That sense dulls which subsequent replays, but there's a lot happening in the stages which makes the experience a lot more engrossing than you might imagine if you've never snapped a 'mon before.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

But that's not the only thing it revealed during the latest livestream.\nIn a bit of a surprise announcement, Sega unveiled a new USB controller — based on the classic SHARP Cyber Stick — that will be compatible with the tiny console.

          "description": "COPE.\nOne particularly bright spot in Sonic's recent history was the release of Sonic Mania. One part sequel and one part reimagining of the 2D classics, that retro revival proved to be one of the best-rated and best-selling Sonic projects in recent years. In the (frankly baffling) absence of a true follow-up to Sonic Mania, Sega has instead opted to look to that game’s inspiration for Sonic’s latest 2D release. Billed as Sonic Origins, this new collection presents all the original four Sonic games—including the rarely re-released Sonic 3 & Knuckles—in enhanced widescreen format with the new option to treat all the 2D entries as if they were all one big game. The end result is, well, exactly what you’d expect. All these classic Sonic games look better than ever with their new presentation and some light quality of life updates, but those of you who have already run through Green Hill Zone more times than you can count may be left wishing for a little more.\nClearly, the main draw of this package is the original 16-bit platformers and we’re happy to report that they each remain tremendously enjoyable in their own way. There’s good reason why so many Sonic fans remember these games so fondly (and perhaps a little longingly), and that’s because these games really got what Sonic is all about. No overwrought stories and bizarre self-insert characters here, just a blue dude with a ‘tude who fights an evil mustache man to save a bunch of animals and, eventually, the world.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Whenever it starts, I tend to drop whatever I'm doing - work, dishes, significant other - and I'll be out frolicking in the downpour before they've hit the floor.\nBecause I love rain so much, I hold games to an almost unfair standard when it comes to the simulation of precipitation. How in the world can a videogame come close to emulating that wonderful, transcendental feeling of being outside in the middle of a thunderstorm? The answer is, it can't. Games have to rely on other things, like textures, sounds, and clever little animations to really sell the idea of being out amongst the H₂s and the Os.\nThe time has come, fellow pluviophiles. It's time to grade the very best rain that PC gaming has to offer. Below you'll find our eight worthy contenders. Each has been chosen for their spectacular rendition of one of nature's greatest phenomena. Each one shall be marked according to my patented and cutting-edge WIPERS grading system for digital rain.

The Enhanced Edition is out today and I've been flicking back and forth between the two versions, tutting. The Enhanced Edition still looks like a 25-year-old game, only now it looks 25 years old, blurry, and unlike itself.\nRead more",

          "description": "I still don't know whether to describe The Heroic Legend Of Eagarlnia as \"complicated\" or \"simple\". Before starting a game, it gives an impression of being a complex grand strategy that's something like a fantasy Total War with a D&D alignment system and a distinctly East Asian focus on characters and dialogue.\nIt's far simpler than that. There was a period of disappointment, even, when it seemed like there wasn't much to it at all. That's partly because it's easy to play it too passively, or get stuck in attritional stand offs, and partly because of the need for a bit too much repetition. But over time its subtler details become more apparent, and your choices start to feel more multifaceted.\nAnd yet, it remains at heart the same throughout. On your first ten turns you're doing the same actions as in your 200th, and its battles in particular are largely hands off. So maybe it's complicated, but simple to actually play? Hmm.\nRead more",

I have now played through a small bit of the game, a slightly extended version of the area I saw in the hands off preview, and my analysis is... largely the same.\nI know that's very boring, but it's also positive, isn't it? Oxenfree was good, and Oxenfree II looks to be doing those same things that made Oxenfree good. A 2D, side-on supernatural thriller with radios. Good thing remains good! In a world where sequels to beloved media seem to only get progressively worse, I'll happily take it (especially since this one is a Netflix-published project now). And although it's directly related to the first game, the characters and happenings in Oxenfree II are distinct enough that it's going to be accessible if you're new to the series. And even if you did play the first game, it's possible that Oxenfree II will be more thrilling and unsettling to you now, five years later.\nRead more",

In most games these are either quick and easy or time-consuming and easy, but not The Cycle: Frontier. Oh no.\r\n\n\r\nSee, without a dedicated benchmarking tool, running these kinds of tests requires a certain controllable environment, where variables are known and parameters can be reset in a click. This is not the case for The Cycle: Frontier, whose environment is usually trying to fucking kill you, particularly though the unavoidable presence of other players. I’ve never sat down to record some average FPS values only to spend half my time cowering behind a tree, fearful of being shot, robbed and – worst of all – forced to start work over again.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Blizzard have confirmed they’re delaying the launch of gem-wrangling time sink Diablo Immortal in the Asia Pacific region until July 7th, so they can complete “optimization”. The delay was originally announced on Sunday by the game’s regional publisher in China, NetEase, and was picked up on by industry analyst Daniel Ahmad on Twitter. The decision to delay came a few days after Chinese microblogging site Sina Weibo banned the Diablo Immortal account due to unspecified \"violation of related laws and regulations\".\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Last week Intel published a “quick start guide” for their upcoming Arc A-series graphics cards, including a “Supported Hardware Configurations” section that only specifically namechecked their own 10th, 11th and 12th Gen Core CPUs. Cue a heady mix of confusion and perturbation – surely Intel weren’t suggesting that Arc GPUs would only function when paired with an Intel CPU, and a relatively new one at that?\r\n\n\r\nNo, they weren’t, though the guide’s vague wording isn’t doing it – and worse, potential Arc users – any favours. Parts of the guide appear to conflate support for Resizable BAR with support for the Arc A-series in general, which further muddies things as Resizable BAR works on AMD Ryzen chips as well as those three Core CPU generations. I asked Intel directly for clarification and essentially, Arc GPUs won’t have such super specific CPU requirements just to run - though they’ll apparently perform better in systems that do support Resizable BAR.\r\n\n \nRead more",

There were some demos I was meant to play for, like, actual work, and then I ran into a puzzle wall or a bug or something so I just fired up Necrosmith again.\nNecrosmith is a 2D necromance 'em up that is also sort of a tower defence game. In the middle of the map is your evil lair, the Hall Of Bones, a sort of legally distinct Sauron's tower that gets more flying buttresses the more you upgrade it. If enemies (which can be packs of wolves or flying bugs or all manner of things) do enough damage to destroy it, you lose - so that's your defense bit. For the towers bit, you have to imagine that the towers can move on their own, and also that they're shambling undead monsters made from a jigsaw of different limbs you find, like an army of very unhygenic Mr Potato Heads.\nRead more",

Partly to help you all avoid the duds and partly to satisfy my own morbid curiosity, I trawled through this Summer's Steam Next Fest demo list to test out a bunch. As you might expect, I got subjected to some chugging framerates and a bit of body horror, but also found some great multiplayer shooting in Dysterra and terrific tile-placement in Above Snakes, which might just become a new personal favourite.\nRead more",

The RTS potential for an interplanetary ground war against overwhelming swarms of giant not-insects is obvious enough. But the dual spirit of most Paul Verhoeven films is a major reason that The Extraordinary Lust Of Dizzy (working title: Starship Troopers) still holds up 25 years on.\n\r\n\r\nTerran Command understands that. Certainly it nods to the satire here and there, but mostly it focuses on the shooting and desperate defences and evacuations instead. This was the right decision. Though it's a little short on narrative flavour, unless you're really into exploring the setting, it's got enough tactical heft to make up for it.\r\n\r\n \nRead more",

At this year's Summer Geoff Fest, I caught up with Flynn for another quick chat. This time, we dug into the game's recently revealed card crafting and realm-hopping features, as well as the choices you might make along the way.\nRead more",

VideoCardz spotted the press release for the small-scale launch, which confirms some of the A380 specs, its comfort zone of 1080p / 60fps on medium quality settings, and a recommended price: 1030 yuan. That’s about £130 / $150, not accounting for regional tax maths.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Their Zero-G 27-in 1440p 144Hz curved monitor has dropped from $250 to $190 - mere pocket change*! \nExaggerations aside, this is a legitimately good price for a monitor of this spec, especially one that has actually attracted reasonable reviews in its category. It ticks a lot of boxes - great contrast, good colour accuracy, reasonable pixel density, a sturdy stand, four display inputs and FreeSync/G-Sync Compatible support.

The cheapest RTX 2060 on Amazon costs £370, but if you're willing to go refurbished you pay way less: just £190. \nThat's a heck of a deal for an RTX and DLSS-capable graphics card, especially given the GPUs come with a six month warranty from the folks at Laptop Outlet. This Zotac card will run rings around the GTX 1660 Super, the best card you could buy new for this price, especially in games that support DLSS to boost frame-rates. \nRead more",

But hoo boy, DNF Duel, Capcom Fighting Collection, an incoming new season for Guilty Gear Strive, and, of course, Street Fighter 6 looking better by the week. We eating good, FGC, here's hoping the banquet continues.\nCreatures of the Night\nSo, before we all get back to our own individual fights, be sure to gather in the comments and tell the good people whatcha been playing. It's currently looking like the first half of 2022 might prove to be the heavier six months in regards to exciting, top-tier releases, and as such, there are probably a lot of rad titles you have queued up.

The idea is to be better (read: faster) at completing objectives than the opposing squad, in order to appease a conniving AI named Leviathan.\nIt's not going to be to everyone's tastes — and I sympathize with any ride-or-die fan who is exclusively holding out for a Dino Crisis revival (maybe one day...) — but as someone who got into Lost Planet back in the day, I'm intrigued.

          "description": "Chris Pratt as Mario is still leaving me skeptical\nWhen we all saw that Chris Pratt had been cast as the plumber in red in the upcoming animated Mario movie, a few eyebrows were raised, to say the least. He's a fine actor, but I don't know that I trust him to do one of the most iconic video game characters justice, especially after the legacy that Charles Martinet has created.\nOne of the most glaring questions to come up surrounding Pratt's involvement in the movie over the past few weeks is whether or not he'll have an Italian accent, which is arguably one of Mario's most recognizable features.\nIn an exclusive interview with Variety, Pratt gave a little bit of insight into what fans can expect from his work on the movie.\n\n\"I worked really closely with the directors and trying out a few things and landed on something that I’m really proud of and can’t wait for people to see and hear,\" Pratt said. \"I’m providing a voice for an animated character, and it is updated and unlike anything you’ve heard in the Mario world before.\"\nThis could mean a lot of things, but I hope it means that they at least did something. The thought of Chris Pratt's unaltered voice coming out of Mario sends chills down my spine.\nWhen Variety brought up fans' apprehension in a separate interview about Pratt's casting as a character of Italian heritage, Illumination Entertainment's founder and CEO Chris Meledandri said that because he is Italian American himself, he feels that he can \"make that decision without worrying about offending Italians or Italian Americans. … I think we’re gonna be just fine. Especially because (Pratt has) given such a strong performance.\"\nMeledandri also said that \"when people hear Chris Pratt’s performance, the criticism will evaporate.\" I guess we'll have to wait and see about that one.\nThe post Chris Pratt says his Mario voice gives an ‘updated’ take on the classic character appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Sekiro has had a second wind lately and I'm loving it\nLook, this was an easy sell for me. I'm a simple man: I see Sekiro news in 2022, even by way of fan-created content, and I get excited. That includes this Elden Ring Sekiro mod (with a bit of Bloodborne), which addresses one crucial mechanical aspect: rolling/dodging.\nCreated by nmsl2018, the mod's concept is very easy to grasp, but it has a whopper of a name: \"replace light roll animation with Sekiro step and medium roll with Bloodborne step.\" The title says it all! It literally removes the light roll from the game and replaces it with the Sekiro quickstep, and the medium roll (which most players are likely working with) is now a Bloodborne sidestep. In other words, combat is going to flow a lot differently with a different dodge animation/mechanic.\nSo Bloodborne always gets a ton of praise, but you gotta love seeing anything mention Sekiro in 2022. Anecdotally, I've heard of a lot of people getting either back into Sekiro or playing it for the first time after folks have finished Elden Ring, which is fantastic. It never really got the same amount of coverage or any significant post-launch content, but it'll go down in history as an action classic.\nConsider this an extra positive review, on top of our review! While it might not be the ideal candidate for a \"first From Software game,\" it forges its own path and differentiates itself from the rest of the pack in a big way.\nThe post This light Elden Ring mod replaces rolling with Sekiro and Bloodborne sidesteps appeared first on Destructoid.",

The Prince of Persia remake was quietly moved to a new release window.

          "description": "Wards are being revised to favor private housing\nIn yet another move to satiate folks who want to buy an in-game house, the Final Fantasy XIV player housing system is changing a bit. But not nearly enough as some may have hoped.\nAs a recap, player housing continues to be a problem. The recent lottery system for the new zone didn't really go as planned, and big free companies [guilds] snatch up a lot of land, frustrating players who want a private home. The team, largely, hasn't really done anything to alleviate these issues. And the upcoming fix (slated for July) isn't going to do much either.\nBreaking it down, Square Enix has announced that starting July 10, at 8AM PT, Final Fantasy XIV player housing ward ownership will be revised. So in the past, free company housing was allowed for wards one through 18: now it's wards one through nine. Previously, private housing was focused on wards 19 through 24, now it's 10 through 24.\nIn theory, it's a big boost. But the heart of the matter is that free companies have already taken a ton of housing. On some servers, this might amount to one or two total houses for the entire populace, as-is. Now as free companies break up/quit the game and more houses become available, it could help in the future. But for now, players can't help but feel like the player housing responses so far have been underwhelming.\nThe post Final Fantasy XIV player housing is being changed a bit, but it’s not quite enough appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Spartan Points could let players directly buy cosmetics\n343 Industries is looking into a new way to pick up cosmetics in its Halo collection. The studio says it's considering adding microtransactions to Halo: The Master Chief Collection through purchasable Spartan Points.\nPrior to now, Seasons in Halo: The Master Chief Collection offered Season Points, which were earned through challenges and leveling up. But Seasons are being fazed out of the MCC. 343 Industries confirms in its blog post that these will be renamed to Spartan Points in the future.\nAlongside the change, 343 is looking at new ways to unlock cosmetics. This would be through purchasing Spartan Points.\n\"It is prudent to note here that we are happy with the current system of how players earn Spartan Points, by completing challenges and levelling up through play. This would be an optional, additive alternative for players who might find the vast scope of content to be an intimidating amount of playtime and want to get ahead on (or skip) the grind, or maybe want to grab specific items they want (we all have our favorites!)\"\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qBkw4YwGrM\nThe Master Chief's Collection\nIt's important to note this is being internally explored, for the time being. 343 says it's sharing the idea ahead of time in the interest of \"transparency\" with the community.\nIt's also stressing that Spartan Points would be additive. And it's worth noting the sheer amount of cosmetics in Halo: The Master Chief Collection: well over 1000, by 343's count.\nAs long as playtime-earning these cosmetics still exists, there are two avenues for Halo cosmetics. Purchasable points seem like they would potentially be a fast-track, buy-it-now option.\nMore updates on Halo: The Master Chief Collection and its Spartan Points are coming in the future.\nThe post Halo: The Master Chief Collection may get microtransactions through purchasable Spartan Points appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Star Fox 64 and Kirby 64 were changed behind the scenes too\nNintendo has made some minor N64 system changes to coincide with the release of Pokemon Snap (the original) on the Switch Online service. Interestingly enough, they're making it tougher to datamine the exact changes with each subsequent Expansion Pack patch.\nThe obfuscation of the configuration files was discovered by dataminer OatmealDome, who pointed out the new alteration on Twitter. What they were able to sleuth out though is extra language options for the EU version, as well as the addition of CPU hacks for Star Fox 64 and Kirby 64. F-Zero X and Mario Golf's files were changed too, potentially in a bid to address the former's framerate problems users have been pointing out since it arrived.\nAt the very least, this changelog (while clouded in mist) shows that Nintendo is still updating the Nintendo 64 lineup, following the incredibly rocky launch. Some didn't hold out hope that they'd revisit them, but since then, they've tackled some of the bigger, rougher needs, including a game-breaking bug for Kirby 64.\nThat's the good news in terms of the Nintendo 64 project. The bad news is that the cadence is still super slow. There are tons of games to get to, even in terms of just first-party releases, and in 2022, the drip-feed release model doesn't quite hit the same.\nThe post Pokemon Snap is out on Switch, amid small N64 system changes appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Blasts from the Past\nEdia, the indie outfit behind the recent Valis: The Fantasm Collection is getting back on board the retro train this week, opening a brand new crowdfunding campaign to secure the budget for a brand new remaster/rerelease of forgotten Nippon Telenet franchise Cosmic Fantasy.\nOriginally released on PC Engine way back in 1990, Cosmic Fantasy: Adventure Boy Yuu is a dungeon-crawling RPG that focuses on our young protagonist who is forced from a pleasant life of farming to become the leader of an intergalactic space force. As you do. Accompanied by his feline pal Nyan and the beautiful Saya, Yuu embarked upon multiple adventures, with the franchise going on to spawn toys, manga, and anime series. It is renowned for its quirky nature, goofy comedic style, and cheesecake \"sexy\" content.\n\nCosmic Fantasy: Adventure Boy Yuu would receive a number of sequels and spin-offs, though it seems that Edia's new collection will only be focusing on the original title and its ultra-rare, 1991 TurboGrafx-CD sequel Cosmic Fantasy 2: Adventure Boy Van. The latter title was the only release in the series to see a localized launch outside of Japan, so fans of M.I.A. titles — as well as the golden age of sci-fi anime — will no doubt be hoping that this collection will find its eventual way to western shores.\nCrowdfunding on Makuake, Edia is looking to raise ¥3 million (or roughly $23,000 USD) and seems relatively confident that it will do so, given that the developer has already announced a launch date and price for the finished product. We will be sure to give you a heads up when more information is forthcoming. Cosmic Fantasy Collection is tentatively scheduled to launch in Japan December 2022 on Nintendo Switch.\nCosmic Fantasy Collection announced for Switch [Gematsu]\nThe post Cosmic Fantasy Collection currently crowdfunding on Makuake appeared first on Destructoid.",

A few of them are even \"rare!\" The main one that sticks out is a problem with the save screen, which is also referred to as a \"rare\" problem: but one that even one total person would find devastating. You can read the full list here on Nintendo's official site, or below.\nPersonally, I haven't encountered any of these issues pre-launch, so folks should hopefully be good to go with it installed. Ideally, if a day one patch is in the cards, the powers that be will swiftly fix anything other people find as well. In a game as big as Three Hopes with as many party variations and missions, someone will likely find something the team missed.\nFire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes patch version 1.0.1 (Released June 23, 2022)\nFixed a rare issue where the game sometimes freezes at the end of an event.\nFixed a rare issue where the game sometimes freezes when moving from Base Camp to the War Map.\nFixed a rare issue where, after selecting a file to save to on the save screen, the screen does not change and progress is blocked.\nFixed an issue where progressing certain battles in certain sequences causes the player to get stuck and prevents progress.\nFixed an issue where using a Partner Special at certain times causes the Partner Special to not end and prevents progress.\nFixed an issue where the switch Lock On target control does not work when controlling the game with the left or right Joy-Con held horizontally.\nFixed various other issues to improve comfort of gameplay.\nThe post Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes gets a thankfully minor day one patch appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's available digitally on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox consoles, and on the Nintendo Switch. The Enhanced Edition is also getting a Limited Run physical version, too.\nWhile Westwood may be known for its history in the real-time strategy genre, Blade Runner was its surprise adventure hit. It runs alongside the Ridley Scott film, weaving through the events of the movie. It has branching paths though, and has been well-remembered for both its style and impressive design.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDxS2jh76Kg\nRemastered dreams of electric sheep\nNightdive, the studio which has tackled other remasters like System Shock: Enhanced Edition, has put a few modern touches on Blade Runner. Since it's coming to consoles, gamepad support is an obvious one.\nThe original Westwood videos have been upscaled to 4K resolution and 60 frames per second. There is also an HD display, and a new clue interface. Plus, international fans can use the original foreign-language translations in Spanish, German, French, Italian, and Chinese subtitles.\nAs for reception? Well, it currently seems iffy. Users on Steam are voting it into the Mostly Negative tier on launch day. Rock Paper Shotgun also had some words about this Enhanced Edition compared to other options, and provided some good comparison screenshots.\nThere is another version of the original Blade Runner just for PC, on GOG.

Our solar system’s largest planet may play host to a seemingly eternal storm, but something far fiercer is brewing on Callisto. It’s here that the creator of the Dead Space series, Glen Schofield, stages perhaps his most horrifying project yet.\nSet 300 years in the future, The Callisto Protocol unmistakably carries Schofield’s creative DNA, but through innovative technology, an uncompromised vision, and lessons learned from decades of development experience, Striking Distance Studios feels it has something more than a spiritual successor on its hands. The Callisto Protocol challenges players to face their fears as they descend into the depths of a lunar prison overrun by monstrous, infected humans and uncover what happened to one of our great hopes for life beyond Earth. We witnessed never-before-seen gameplay and spent hours picking the brains of Striking Distance Studios’ veteran developers to learn how this team is creating one of the scariest, most intense games of 2022.\nIn 2019, Schofield took a trip out to the desert to get away from the hustle and bustle of the game industry. Just months prior, he had left Activision, a publisher with whom he had worked for nearly a decade. While there, he helped lead a studio he cofounded, Sledgehammer Games, as it worked on three mainline Call of Duty titles: Modern Warfare 3, Advanced Warfare, and WWII. Schofield eventually transitioned to an executive role within Activision before leaving the company less than a year later. He decided to take some time off and plot his next move.\nRead more...",

          "description": "coverage here.\n\nIn a recent Reddit AMA, the Overwatch 2 team from Blizzard Entertainment took questions from the community regarding the state of the franchise and the upcoming pseudo-sequel to its popular hero shooter. In one answer, the folks from Blizz confirm an interesting detail about OW2 when it hits Early Access in the first week of October: it’ll replace the original Overwatch entirely.\nWhen OW2 launches on Oct 4th it will be a replacement for the current Live Service.\n\nRather than being a separate app on your console of choice or the Blizzard launcher, Overwatch 2 won’t be built up bit by bit on its own but will take the place of the original game and build off of that instead.\nWhile Overwatch 1 and 2 have always been planned to be tied together into a single client and overall roadmap, this is the first time Blizzard has announced publically that Overwatch 1 will cease to exist entirely when the sequel launches. Get your 6v6 games in now because they won’t be playable as of the OW2 Early Access launch.\nAlso of note from this quote is the timeframe of PvE content coming to OW2. Its initial Early Access content this year will provide a revamp to the PvP experience with new heroes, maps, modes, etc., but the long-touted narrative content for the sequel will be coming sometime in 2023 instead of with the rest of the package.\nOverwatch 2 will be free-to-play starting on October 4 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.",

          "description": "Illumination’s upcoming animated Mario movie was recently delayed to next spring. Perhaps the biggest downside to that news is the fact that we have to go even longer before hearing what Chris Pratt’s Mario voice sounds like. Today, Variety caught up with Pratt to ask about the film, with the actor describing his take on Mario as “unlike anything you’ve heard in the Mario world before.”\nFor those unaware, Pratt portrays Mario in the film and much the biggest buzz around the film has centered on his voice. Some have expressed concern about a non-Italian playing an Italian character and the voice potentially being offensive while the film’s co-producer described Pratt’s performance as “phenomenal.” \nSpeaking to Variety, Pratt discusses how experimented with the voice and worked closely with directors to find a unique take on Mario that he felt proud of, saying in part “It’s an animated voiceover narrative. It’s not a live-action movie. I’m not gonna be wearing a plumber suit running all over. I’m providing a voice for an animated character, and it is updated and unlike anything you’ve heard in the Mario world before.”\nRegardless of what Pratt sounds like, Nintendo is reportedly happy with the film, which was said to be mostly finished last November, so Illumination must be doing something right. The Mario movie is slated to premiere in U.S. theaters on April 7. In addition to Chris Pratt’s Mario, the cast includes Charlie Day (Luigi), Anya Taylor-Joy (Peach), Jack Black (Bowser), Keegan-Michael Key (Toad), and Seth Rogen (Donkey Kong).  \n[Source: Variety]",

          "description": "Despite being heavily criticized for his role in Activision Blizzard’s ongoing employee sexual abuse scandal, CEO Bobby Kotick will remain on the company’s board of directors for another year.\nThe publisher held its annual meeting of stockholders, who voted on five proposals, such as its list of ten directors, including Kotick, to serve one-year terms. The document detailing the results shows that an overwhelming 533,703,580 investors voted in Kotick’s favor against 62,597,199 who voted against him. 2,162,178 shareholders abstained from voting.\nThe result means that Kotick retains his spot until Activision’s 2023 stockholder meeting next June. The development comes after Kotick spent the last year under fire for reportedly hiding details of the company’s abuse problems from shareholders, which caused some employees and investors to call for his resignation. Kotick has responded by reducing his salary until “transformational gender goals” were met. Activision has since hired new chief diversity, equity, and inclusion officer. \nAlthough Kotick remains on Activision’s board, his future as CEO once Microsoft’s acquisition of the company is complete remains unknown. The deal isn’t expected to go through until sometime next summer, possibly around the time of the next stockholder meeting.",

A new War Table blog post names the date fans will see the Goddess of Thunder in action.\nMark Monday, June 27 on your calendar as the date to watch a War Table Deep Dive detailing Jane's powers and abilities. Jane will become available as part of the 2.5 update, which arrives just a day later on June 28. That should whet fans' appetite for the character's Norse-powered return in the upcoming Thor: Love & Thunder, which hits theaters on July 8. \nIt'll be interesting to see how Crystal Dynamics differentiates Jane's moveset from Thor's. In the comics, Jane possessed all of the abilities of Thor during her time as the Goddess of Thunder. The only notable difference was her ability to manipulate Mjolnir with greater control and creativity (especially when throwing it) than her predecessors, so that's something the studio can certainly hone in and expand upon. \nFor more on Marvel's Avengers, check out our evolving list of every playable hero in the game.",

But vague time frames are a thing of the past, No Man's Sky is officially coming to the Switch October 7. \nFans all over the world can pick up either a physical or digital copy of the game come October. In addition to the Nintendo console launch, PlayStation 5 owners will be able to buy a physical remastered edition on the same date. The remaster will come with all the previously released content included, which when tallied up means new-gen PlayStation owners will have access to 20 different updates in total.\n\n\nLooking over the titles's long history and its new leap onto the Switch, Hello Games founder Sean Murray observed the following.\n No Man's Sky's Switch and PS5 remastered editions are set to release on October 7, but you can also purchase a copy of the game on all major platforms.",

It first established its headquarters in Sunnyvale, California, neighbor to a host of now-famous tech startups. The new logo, a callback to the retro design of the old location, features the company’s classic branding alongside a semi-transparent “50.” Atari is calling the limited-time celebration logo “Borregas” after the street where you could find the headquarters. According to the company, this design will join with the previously revealed “Sunnyvale” anniversary logo in gracing the many upcoming corporate announcements, game reveals, partnerships, and merchandising collaborations.\n “Design innovation was a fundamental driver and differentiator for Atari during the golden age of video games,” said Wade Rosen, CEO of Atari. “Every artist, designer, and engineer challenged themselves to reach creative excellence; it is a hallmark of Atari that persists to this day.”\nIn the midst of the logo’s reveal, it also looks like an Atari classic is getting a revival. According to Gamerbraves, a follow-up to Yar’s Revenge is in the works. The information comes straight from Howard Scott Warshaw, who worked at Atari in the ‘80s and created the title for the Atari 2600. The interview contained few concrete details on the project, just that it seems the sequel has been greenlit. Hopefully, we will hear more about the game as development continues.",

The title is described as a multiplayer, multi-team heist experience set in space with a punky comic book aesthetic. What this means practically is players can jump into five teams of three to battle each other over a prize and \"engage, evade, exploit, and steal their way to victory.\" The game's debut trailer shows off some fast-pasted action, but to see everything for yourself, you can check out the trailer below.\n\n\nThe story envisions a world in which the billionaires have finally made it to mars, destroying Earth in the process. However, the rich get nostalgic for their former planet's culture. So, they send out ships to collect plunder from the remnants of Earth's poor survivors. Not content to take this sitting down, the Hyenas are fighting back.\nThe game is still in early development, so the creators have not revealed the release date, but we do know the game is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Though it's still a ways off, you can sign up for Hyenas' alpha today, and you can learn much more about the title in IGN's Summer of Gaming interview-filled stream.",

That ranges from designing a room with strategically placed entry points for the biophage, The Callisto Protocol’s monsters, to pop out, to obsessing over details as small as whether a light bulb should flicker two times or three.

Whatever. But there's more to it than PlayStation's ever-growing list of really expensive games.\nI had little-to-no interest in the new PlayStation Plus when it was announced. But when Sony gave me three free months – the perks of being in the press, I guess, but also something I should disclose given the glowing nature of this piece – I took the time to scroll through the games list. \nTo my delight, it's full of weirdo games you probably haven't heard of and definitely have not played. Immediately, I downloaded nearly a dozen games based solely on the criteria of \"Does this look weird and/or interesting?\" It's been a blast. \nI finally played through the Gravity Rush series, and while I think Gravity Rush 2 is disappointing, the original is fantastic. I highly recommend checking it out. It takes about seven hours to mainline and consistently keeps mission design interesting. It's also a ton of fun throwing yourself around its dizzying open world. \nI also played Mitsurugi Kamui hikae. It's an objectively bad game but I can't help but love it. You play as a girl with a big sword, going after your friend who is also a girl with a big sword – but she's evil. You load into bland combat arenas that look ripped straight out of a PlayStation 2 game and fight enemies that all look the same. Again, it's bad. But charmingly, in a way I appreciate. I played for an hour and loved every second.\nNext up are Disaster Report 4, Tokyo Jungle, and the Siren series. I can't wait. But I want to know, what hidden gems have you found on PlayStation Plus? Keep it weird, unique, and interesting. If you're finally checking out Red Dead Redemption II, keep it to yourself. We all know that's a great game.

          "description": "The Callisto Protocol captured the attention of horror fans worldwide with its terrifying world and oppressive sense of horror, but how does it feel to play it? In this exclusive Game Informer interview, Ben Walker, design director at Striking Distance Studios, breaks down how combat, dodging, and the bounty of gameplay systems work.\n\n\nJoin Alex Stadnik and Marcus Stewart as they grill Ben on all things Callisto gameplay. The trio kicks off the conversation by dissecting the basics of combat. In Callisto, players balance melee and ranged encounters to keep protagonist Jacob alive as he fights through Saturn's dead moon. At your side is your trusty shiv, a shock baton, and a wide swath of weapons to fend off the Biophage and figure out what's happening on the moon.\nWhile that may seem like a pretty standard setup, the key is how players balance their approach to enemy encounters. Callisto is not a game that will overpower players. Jacob has limited ammo and health and can't go in guns blazing if he hopes to survive. Those who delve into the fray will also have to utilize the new dodging system Striking Distance emphasizes as a massive part of combat. Instead of a simple button press, you'll have to use the left stick to dodge either left or right at the precise moment. Blocking works too, but it will always cost you a bit of health. Callisto has a lot going on moment to moment, but Striking Distance hopes this dance leads to a thrilling moment-to-moment experience.\nIf that's not enough, we also discuss how the team utilizes the PlayStation 5 controller to up the immersion, upgrade trees, and much more.\nIf you want to learn more about The Callisto Protocol, be sure to head over to our exclusive cover hub below, where you'll find our preview impressions, the GI cover reveal, and more looks at the game in the upcoming days. Thanks, as always, for watching.",

          "description": "Remakes of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 and 4 were planned at some point until publisher Activision pulled the plug. This news comes from Tony Hawk himself, who discussed the series with streamer andyTHPS. \nAccording to Hawk, the \"plan\" was to develop remakes for THPS 3 and 4 following the release of the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2 remake. That plan, however, got complicated after Activision merged THPS1 and 2 developer Vicarious Visions into Blizzard. \n\"The truth of it is that they were trying to find someone to do [Tony Hawk's Pro Skater] 3 and 4, but they just didn't really trust anyone the way they did Vicarious, so they took other pitches from other studios,\" Hawk says in the clip. \"Like, 'What would you do with a THPS title?' And they didn't like anything they heard, and then that was it.\"\nYou can watch the full clip below: \nTony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 remasters were in the works but they were scrapped after Vicarious Visions was merged into Blizzard. 😔\nhttps://t.co/84rlYDgvUQ pic.twitter.com/oWR70xTOYv\nJune 20, 2022\nAt the very least, it doesn't sound like THPS3 and 4 was actively in development. As Hawk says in the clip, it was planned, but he never indicates it was in production. More curious is Activision's interest in taking the series in new directions. Historically, that's been a bad idea.  \nThe news is particularly painful because, after a drought of skateboarding games, the excellent Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2 seemed to indicate the king of action sports was back. As we said in our review,  \"the Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater franchise may once again have a bright future thanks to this terrific blast from the past.\" Alas, history proves otherwise. \nBut actually, skateboarding games have had a renaissance in recent years. Of course, there's Vicarious Visions' Tony Hawk's Pro Skater reboot. There's also OlliOlli World, Skate City, Session, and Skater XL.",

In a new update to the battle royale game, the Sith Lord is unleashed and he won't hesitate to take you down, but if you can take him out first, you'll get his lightsaber as a reward.\nVader appears in random places each match but is easy to locate since he arrives at the island at the same time as the players. When you are in the Battle Bus, look for an Imperial Shuttle. It'll enter the airspace just above the clouds and will quickly descend to a spot on the map. The Shuttle is highlighted with a blue glow for a few seconds after settling down on the surface.\nVader is one of the toughest bosses in the game and will take some serious firepower to take out. He's also flanked by two stormtroopers. He uses the Force in a variety of ways to mess with you and can block your shots. Your best bet is to attack him from afar with a sniper rifle or approach in a group. \nHis lightsaber is a game-changer. You too can block shots with it, and it can also be thrown a decent distance to inflict big damage. Of course, you can swing it widely for melee strikes. We don't know how long Vader will be around or how he is influencing the story, but it's awesome to see him on the island dishing out punishment. Here's hoping more Star Wars integration is on the way soon!",

If a studio wants to take a new crack at an old game, especially if it’s the studio behind the original release, why not?

Over the next few weeks, we’ll be covering the history and lore of Capcom’s premiere action franchise. This week we go all the way to hell with Dante as we unpack the mysterious low-point in the series, Devil May Cry 2.\nReleasing a short 15 months after the release of Devil May Cry, Dante returns with a 2-disc adventure that’s more often than not seen as the worst game in the series, and there are very good reasons as to why it turned out that way. In this episode of Video Gameography, we talk about the tumultuous development cycle that didn’t include the team behind DMC, Team Little Devils. From an unknown first director to arcade-focused developers making their first console game and a late transition of direction, Devil May Cry 2 has all of the trappings of a project that would have been canceled. That is, if not for the man who would shepherd the series for years to come. \nJoin hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), John Carson (@John_Carson), along with Game Informer Editor-In-Chief Andrew Reiner (@Andrew_Reiner) \nIf you’d like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com.

          "description": "Nerf, the leading foam dart and water weapon manufacturer, has unveiled its first-ever mascot, which fittingly goes by the name Murph. Murph Nerfington (I gave them the last name) will represent the company as part of a multi-year marketing push in social media, public events, and more.\nMurph looks like a Koosh mascot more than a Nerf representative, although that would still be under the Hasbro umbrella. However, if you look closely, you can see Murph is made entirely out of foam Nerf darts. The new character was created in association with a new summer initiative for the company to invite families to get out and play. Also, given the language of they/them pronouns in the mascot's announcement, Murph doesn’t have a set gender. So happy Pride month, Murph! The company even has a new mnemonic that Murph embodies, “Unleash the play in you.” I’m not sure what hard-to-remember topic this mnemonic is supposed to remind us of, but it’s a cute enough slogan nonetheless.\nBelow are a handful of promotional images of Murph handing some new Nerf weapons and looking like a late 2000s physics tech demo. \n\nIn a press release shared with Game Informer, here’s what Adam Kleinman, senior vice president and general manager of Nerf, has to say to welcome Murph into existence: \n“The launch of Murph is a testament to the success of Hasbro’s Brand Blueprint strategy and turning Nerf into the social, active play brand it is seen as today. We are thrilled to introduce Murph to fans, a mascot that represents the playful spirit that lives inside us all and is unleashed through Nerf.”\nIf you see Murph around this summer, make sure to give them a nice cold spray from your Nerf Super Soaker. You'd be doing them a favor; it has to be hotter than hell in that suit.\nWhere on the mascot family tree do you think Murph belongs? Is it on the branch with Gritty, or maybe with AM/PM's Toomgis? How about with the McDonald's Fry Kids? Let us know in the comments!",

          "description": "A new Game of Thrones series is reportedly in the works, and it will reunite fans with Jon Snow after the events of the show’s finale. \nThe Hollywood Reporter states that HBO has begun developing the live-action spin-off series, reporting that Kit Harrington is attached to reprise his role as Jon Snow should it proceed. HBO and Kit Harrington’s representatives did not respond to THR’s request for comment. \nFans last saw the character in the Season 8 finale, which saw him venture beyond the Wall after being exiled from Westeros. A follow-up story would, presumably, center on Jon’s new life with the Wildlings. \nAnother Game of Thrones spin-off, the prequel show House of the Dragon, is set to premiere on HBO Max on August 21. That series focuses on House Targaryen 200 years before the original show. It's far from the only TV show in the pipeline based on George R.R. Martin's best-selling series. Other adjacent projects, such as 10,000 Ships, The Golden Empire, 9 Voyages, and Dunk and Egg, are in various stages of development. \n[Source: The Hollywood Reporter]",

I find myself missing the tight encapsulation of excitement E3 used to provide.\nWhat I'd like to see return next year is the attempt to cram all of the big summer industry news into one week or a timeframe close to it.

I’m as intrigued by this game as any avid space opera fan.
