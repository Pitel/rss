There are tweaked visuals, improved shooting, and some added systems crammed into this prequel. As a result, it feels markedly different to Shadow of Chornobyl, but not always in a good way. The shift in focus to faction conflict de-emphasises the persistent atmosphere of dread that permeated the first game.\nYou fill the irradiated boots of Scar, a Stalker with a mysterious condition that allows him to survive the Zone's emissions. Rescued from such an event by research group Clear Sky, he is tasked with tracking down a group of Stalkers as a means of repayment. These rogue mercenaries have designs on reaching the secrets at the centre of the Zone… and one of their number is our old friend Strelok.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "\"I want to stay on the same level\".\nLast month's excellent 'Ode to Castlevania' DLC has got us diving into Poncle's beautiful bullet hell, Vampire Survivors, all over again. We've been having such a good time with the latest expansion that we'd be perfectly happy to see waves of DLC added to this one for years to come, but naturally, Poncle may one day want to move on to a new project. And yet, whatever comes next, it seems we shouldn't expect it to blow the current project's scope out of the water.\nThat is according to the game's creator, Luca Galante, who, in a recent interview with Metro, stated that he wouldn't want a follow-up game to \"try and do something bigger just because it’s what everyone is expecting\". Instead, Galante claims, he'd rather keep working at his own level: \"It would have a higher budget,\" he told Metro, \"but it wouldn’t be dramatically different in terms of scope, than Vampire Survivors\".\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

All this, plus various daft psychological war gambits of my own devising. When overtaking or being overtaken, I used to seal my lips shut on that side and breath through the other corner of my mouth, to make it look like I was hardly out of breath at all.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Putting aside my natural annoyance at Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater for almost beating out the Twarhammer series in the headline real estate wars, I am more than a little excited to play. Some days, you simply must feast on a tree frog, and while we still don’t have a solid release date, that day doesn’t feel too far away. Good news for stealth fans, and perhaps gooder news for a dozen strapline writers sweating profusely, soiling themselves in anticipation of using “kept you waiting, huh?”.\nUntil then, I at least have a steady drip feed of new information to keep me sated, the latest of which is the substantial hint that there'll be some new dialogue in the game, as per the video below. Alongside that, the previously pseudonymous Suzetta Miñet - who was credited with voicing EVA in MGS3 and Peace Walker - has revealed herself to be Jodi Benson, the voice of Ariel in Disney’s The Little Mermaid. Cheers for the spot, Automaton West.\nRead more",

What’s interesting about this one is that vlog mainstay director Rich Alridge has brought along some new faces: battle designer Josh King and audio director Chris Goldsmith.

As such, the game resorts to loading-on-demand systems to ensure that you only see those gorgeous details when the monsters are close by and, as the case may be, angrily sitting on you. When they're further afield, the flourishes fall away to free up memory and processing power. The popular Redditor explanation for the presence of monsters that look like Henry Moore sculpture is basically that the LOD systems are being forgetful, and neglecting to load the additional polygons at proximity.\n  \nRead more",

Still, there is an anecdotal contingent of casual sofa sitters for whom Call Of Duty is the game. A balls-to-the-wall shooter to return to every winter and rinse through in a weekend. Ed has already gestured at its multiplayer, announcing: \"yup, it's COD\", like a deeply tired Captain Birdseye inspecting the day's catch, wondering when his life will change. But never mind that.

          "description": "To say that Factorio: Space Age throws out the rulebook is an understatement. It'd be more fitting to say it's somehow automated the whole process: an inserter plucked out the rulebook from my brain and deposited it in hot magma, while a new rulebook was churned out in a nearby machine and plopped into my brain from the other side - only for that to be immediately plucked out and incinerated as well. With each new planet and each new phase, Space Age reinvents itself. I'm battling hyperbole here, but ah hell, I admit defeat. Factorio: Space Age is a masterpiece, the final form of perhaps the most well-crafted building game I'll ever play.\n Read more",

If you don't like Call Of Duty, you will not like this.\" I feel like we need to emergency-deploy a supply crate of smelling salts, because the sheer OK-ness of Black Ops 6 appears to have tumbled Ed into a stupor. \r\n\n\r\nPerhaps it would be a different story if he'd encountered some of the spawning issues and glitches people are talking about, with players joining games and materialising right into a hail of fire. The players in question include Black Ops 6's developers, who comically note in the latest Black Ops 6 patch notes that \"Yes, we saw ourselves in a Killcam before selecting a Loadout too.\" The latest patch seeks to address this, naturally. As regards the campaign side of things, it also resets your safehouse currency to 5000, if you've had your single player funds stolen (or multiplied) by technical gremlins.\r\n \nRead more",

This might sound utterly damning in the wake of Baldur's Gate 3’s incredible reactivity, and if I approached games as some sort of tedious comparative intellectual exercise rather than just, y’know, seeing how I felt about them, then I suppose it would be. Weirdly, though, the recent memory of Baldur’s Gate 3 didn’t diminish my time with Veilguard at all.

As with the streaming giant's existing labels for M-rated material, sexual themes or depictions of gambling, the idea is that viewers can filter out such streams in advance by altering their settings.\nAdvertisers, similarly, can \"make better choices about the content they want to advertise next to\" - in other words, pull their ads from a whole swathe of material if they don't want to be associated with anything controversial. Twitch's hope is that \"the labels will allow advertisers to have more context to inform which types of streams they show their ads alongside, which we expect to increase brands’ confidence in running ads on Twitch, and could bring new advertisers to our service.\"\n  \nRead more",

Its freely extendable invite system is about as effective at controlling player headcount as a disinterested football steward, meaning pretty much anyone with a clued-in Steam friend can get in and start poking around its secrets. And yet, being a lane-pushing wizard fighter in the Dota 2 vein, it’s already a vast tangle of interplaying abilities, items, strats, and often unspoken rules, of the kind that even experienced gankists will take hundreds of hours to learn. It’s been too much for poor Brendy, at any rate.\nStill, Brendy is but one man. What if we had but four men, working in tandem to crush lanes and flatten Patrons just as Gabe intended? To find out if Deadlock is indeed more comprehensible as a team sport, Graham, Ed, Ollie, and James joined forces, promptly getting fucked up yet emerging from the warlock hospital with a deeper understanding of its workings.

If the ledge-mantling animations are glitchy, that's simply because you have bad genes.\nWe can both be forgiven for losing sight of Assassin's Creed's modern day narrative frame. Ubisoft themselves have downplayed it since the era of Desmond Miles, the watery Peter Parker figure who served as puppetmaster protagonist for AC games up to Assassin's Creed 3.

These differences are the basis for many factional disagreements and thus, many core series plot developments. According to former lead writer David Gaider, however, there's an \"uber-plot\" behind it all that may one day be resolved and bring the series to a close, assuming BioWare continue to refer to his original (and closely guarded) narrative documents.\r\n \nRead more",

It's a claustrophobic send-up of managerial politics and nepotism, with World War 1 unfolding in the background. A real pick-me-up. Sintopia is the Two Point incarnation of that premise - in other words, brighter and breezier and definitely more slapstick than Christian. It puts you in charge of a world divided between Earth and hell, and challenges you to ensure a steady movement of optimally sinful souls between one and the other.

Let's play Devil's Advocate and try to Lionel Hutz that quote: \"Nazis? I hate these guys!\" [pointing at some Communists].

I think his political stance is abundantly obvious in Indiana Jones And The Great Circle - the new Wolfenslike from MachineGames, in which you will blast and bludgeon literally hundreds of Shitlerites in unambiguously one-sided first-person view.

He talked around a lot of the game features, without actually saying much about it. As yet, there's still no footage of the game in action, making its previous release window of 2025 appear even more tenuous.\nRead more",

The developer's next project seems to be pursuing a similar balance of whimsy and darkness. It's another anthology experience, which casts you as a field biologist studying \"the strangeness of organic life\". Also, chicken-legged houses.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The underworld's rulers, Hades and Persephone, were massively bummed out by Orpheus's emo lyre-playing, and swiftly agreed to let him lead Eurydice's soul upward to the waking world, with the extremely simple proviso that he not look back at her till they're both on the surface.\nBeing a love-drunk spannerhead, however, Orpheus couldn't resist a quick peek at Eurydice after crossing the threshold - and the result is a timeless moral about human frailty and the specific truism that you should absolutely never date musicians, which Australian developers Oppolyon Studios appear to have totally ignored in their otherwise-redolent game about kicking your brother's soul out of hell.\n Read more",

The world has ended, the oceans teem with squirmy, extra-dimensional lifeforms, and it's your job as the apparent sole surviving lighthouse keeper to distinguish vessels loaded with eldritch horrors from vessels loaded with people who need saving from eldritch horrors. \nGoing by the teaser trailer, below, this appears to be comparable to playing border guard in Papers, Please, but it's less political and more tentacular. You field queries over the radio, run your finger down a clipboard, and decide whether to kindle the lamps or beg the coastguard to blast that ship back to hell. There's a dialogue line in the trailer which I, personally, would consider highly untrustworthy. \"It's consuming my team!\" screams a self-described ship captain. \"Please, send help! Gosh...\" Look, \"friend\", no genuine human being says \"gosh\" in an emergency situation. Not even British human beings say \"gosh\" in an emergency situation.

Their forthcoming Love Eternal is the story of Maya, a girl whisked off to a \"castle built of bitter memories\" by a weird, lonely god, and obliged to make her way \"through over 100 screens filled with spikes, lasers, switches, and traps\".\nWhen not getting spiked or lasered, Maya appears to spend her days in a kind of metaphorical suburban household. Here, she will contend with things like people crawling on the ceiling and coming over all Babadook. Maya does have one major advantage: the ability to reverse gravity. Watch her put that ability to use in the new trailer.\n Read more",

Shadows Of The Damned's Xbox 360/PS3 release may slip into either camp, depending on whether you liked it back in the day or not. It's a third-person action adventure where two famous video game folks joined forces: No More Heroes' Suda51 and Resident Evil's Shinji Mikami. And to my knowledge, it's considered a bit of a cult classic.\nSo, having played Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered after never experiencing the original, do I think it's any good? If you were a fan of the OG, there's no doubt you'll like it. If you're coming in as a newbie, I think it's refreshing in the sense it's a trim throwback with some interesting ideas and middling-to-good execution.

If your sentiments are anything like I remember a lot of the internet feeling at the time, you may get nightmarish flashbacks to the trailer below, first shown at E3 2010. The project was eventually canceled and adapted into 2013’s The Bureau: XCOM Declassified, but Irrational co-founder and current Wild Bastards studio Blue Manchu founder Jon Chey has shed some light on the FPS’s development, and it sounds like it was once a far more ambitious project.

Pak i tento měsíc je tady pro Vás Virtuální Bastlírna - online setkání hospodského typu všech nadšenců do techniky, organizované projektem MacGyver strahovského studentského klubu SiliconHill.\r\n\r\nPokud by se diskuze náhodou zadrhla, mají Strahováci nachystaná i výplňová témata. Například co se stalo za katastrofy poslední měsíc? Voyager 1 musel kvůli poruše přejít z rychlé komunikace na pásmu X na pomalejší pásmo S. A na neocenitelný WebArchive šlo několik kybernetických útoků, které způsobily nejen výpadek ukládání nových stránek, ale i jeho kompletní nedostupnost.\r\n\r\nAle dost o katastrofách - co za nové projekty se vynořilo? Objevil se nový projekt kompletně 3D tištěného počítače Ondra. Také se našel šikula, který byl schopný rozebrat komunikaci s levnou čínskou termokamerou a získat tak mnohem lepší obrázky. A firma Mosaic uveřejnila patnáctiterapixelový soubor 3D scanů a 360 stupňových obrázků Prahy.\r\n\r\nZ kuriozit se pak nabízí modifikace chytrých baterií firmy Parkside pro kompatibilitu se sítí FindMyIphone, Linux nabootovaný na procesoru Intel 4004 (s malým trikem) a nebo výroba největšího digitronu na světě (v České republice)! \r\n\r\nPříští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat ve čtvrtek 7. listopadu od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.",

When picking a name for the first time, you might not have put much thought behind typing a few letters. Thankfully, there's a way to rectify and change your name if you're not satisfied with what you used the first time.\n\n\nBrighter Shores name change explained\n\n\nWhile you can change your name in Brighter Shores, the method is limited in the sense that you can't avail of the feature if you're free-to-play. The ability to change name is available only to those who have an active subscription to the Premium Pass.\n\n\nIf you have already subscribed to the Premium Pass, you can use the Rename feature to choose a new name. This can also be done later with the help of Eric Inkwell, who can be found at Crenopolis.\n\n\nImage via Destructoid\n\n\nAccess to the Premium Pass offers even more customization options. Free-to-play users have no way of using unique names, and they will always have a suffix at the end of their title. Unique names can't have a duplicate inside the game, which makes your title feel unique.\n\n\nDo note that the ability to change your name will be available as a pop-up the first time you log into the game after subscribing to the Premium Pass. You'll be able to change it again from Eric Inkwell once you've unlocked Crenopolis and the quests of that region. You'll always need an active membership to the Premium Pass for this function.\n\n\nThe Premium Pass also offers plenty of extra gameplay content, as it unlocks two extra regions - Mine of Mantuban and Crenopolis. The regions come with their own places of interest, professions, and more. If you're still unsure about buying the Premium pass, make sure to check out our review of the microtransaction and its offerings.\n\nThe post How to change your name in Brighter Shores appeared first on Destructoid.",

The two are also teaming up for a new vocal song featuring music by River City Girls composer Megan McDuffee. \n\n\nBrawlin' boyz\n\n\nScreenshot via WayForward\n\n\nRounding it all out is the new dojo, Master Boro. As the screens and footage so far indicate, it looks like WayForward put in a lot of work to smoothly integrate the two worlds. Being one of the staples of the genre, it's a no-brainer to throw Double Dragon into the mix wherever possible, but it's nice to see it being done with the right amount of care and respect. Even if it all first emerged to the public as an April Fools' gag! \n\n\nWhen it launches, players can dive into the River City Girls 2 Double Dragon DLC on all available platforms. Crack your knuckles and get ready to fire it up in just six days on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC. \n\nThe post River City Girls 2 Double Dragon DLC release date set for November 12 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Starting in Hopeport, you'll join the Guard and eventually be attacked by enemies and forced to defend. One of your fellow guards, Delana, loses her Bow and asks you to find it for her. Here is where to find Delana's Bow for the Main Story quest in Brighter Shores.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere you can find Delana's Bow\n\n\nYou can find Delana's Bow by heading into the Guard Barracks building located directly behind Delana, and then looking behind the light blue Bed on the north end of the Barracks. You'll see the Bow sticking up behind the bed which you can interact with to pick it up for Delana. Head back outside and talk to Delana and tell her you have found her bow, then hand it over to her.\n\n\nHanding over Delana's Bow to her will complete this part of the Main Story quest and allow to continue forward with it. You'll then have to line up with your other fellow Guards before going out and defending the Town Square from the attacking enemies.\n\n\nA good tip when doing quests like this where you need to find certain items that may be hidden or harder to see, is to use your Sense ability by clicking the Eye icon in the bottom right corner of the screen. When you use Sense, your character sends out a pulse that will highlight everything on the map you are currently on that can be used, interacted with, or picked up. This is a great way to find hard to see items and also to see which interactable spots are located on the map for you to use your various professions on.\n\nThe post Where to find Delana’s Bow for Main Story quest in Brighter Shores appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "As you start to level up your character in Brighter Shores, Knowledge Points will have immense value to help you improve your character.\n\n\nIn Brighter Shores, there are plenty of professions, and they don't work like the typical class system in MMO. You don't get to pick one of them. Instead, all of them will be available at the same time, and you'll have to level them all up together. This is where the Knowledge Point system comes in, and it can help you level up things far more quickly.\n\n\nHow to get Knowledge Points in Brighter Shores\n\n\nThe process of getting a Knowledge Point is directly related to the level of your profession. Whenever you gain XP by taking part in an activity, you'll contribute to achieving a Knowledge Point. The progress can be seen from the Professions tab, which will show your current progress and the exact rewards that you'll receive.\n\n\nEvery form of activity that you undertake will help you increase your progress in gaining a Knowledge Point. It's unclear as of writing (since I have gained just one so far) if you can stack Knowledge Points or if you'll have to spend them immediately. If it's the latter, there are three ways to spend these valuable points in Brighter Shores.\n\n\nImage via Destructoid\n\n\nHow to use Knowledge Points in Brighter Shores\n\n\nKnowledge Points can be used in three different ways.\n\n\n\nUnlock Passive Activity\n\n\nIncrease XP of a specific profession\n\n\nSell for money\n\n\n\nThe recommended use is to unlock Passive Activity, which allows you to gain passive XP for a profession of your choice. You can also use a Knowledge Point to increase the Passive Activity level of a specific profession, which will unlock better rewards.\n\n\nIf you no longer have any Passive Activity to unlock, the Knowledge Points can be used to increase the XP for a profession to get new rewards as well. Make sure not to spend your points on getting money, as that's the least advisable way to spend this resource.\n\nThe post Brighter Shores: How do Knowledge Points work appeared first on Destructoid.",

Game Recording was released in beta form in late June, offering a comprehensive set of in-game capture tools, and now you can give it a shot in stable.\n\n\nSteam Game Recording is a one-stop-shop for the recording of gameplay footage.

          "description": "After seven months of intense work, we are ready to announce support for a few games based on qdEngine, developed by K-D Labs.\nThe work is based on the original sources published now under GPL, although the work started a bit earlier than that. The engine supports 14 games, five of which we are announcing support for. Most of these games were released in Russian; however, there were Lithuanian, Czech, and Polish releases. The support is announced for:\nWait for it! Issue 3. Song for a Hare, (Russian: Ну, погоди! Выпуск 3. Песня для зайца, Lithuanian: Na, palauk! Zuikio dainos, Czech: Jen počkej a Píseň pro zajíce)\nMask Show (Russian: Маски-шоу)\nMarvellous Mice Adventures: Meeting Sea Rat (Russian: Три маленькие белые мышки. Визит Морской крысы, Czech: Příběhy myší rodinky I, Polish: Były Sobie Myszki Trzy: Na Spotkanie Cioci Myszy)\nThe Adventures of the Good Soldier Schweik (Russian: Похождения бравого солдата Швейка)\nMarvellous Mice Adventures: Sea Rat's Birthday, (Russian: Три маленькие белые мышки. День рождения морской крысы, Polish: Były Sobie Myszki Trzy: Urodzinowe Śledztwo)\nOther games do work; however, we haven’t playtested them. You may find more information on our Wiki. Also, we are looking for the Lithuanian version of Little Longnose and Polish releases of Little Mice games and Wait for it! game. If you happen to have a copy, please contact sev.\nWe continue the active development so that support for other games will follow shortly. The primary constraint is playtesting.\nTo run these games, you need the latest daily build of ScummVM. If you encounter any hiccups during your quests, please file them on our issue tracker.\n>",

          "description": "We are excited to announce that Rise of the Dragon  is now ready for public testing. This is the first of a small number of games built using the DGDS (Dynamix Game Development System) engine.\nThe Dynamix name may be familiar – bought by Sierra in 1990, the Dynamix brand continued and became well known for action and puzzle games like The Incredible Machine, A10 Tank Killer, and Red Baron.  They also made a few adventures using the custom DGDS engine.\nRise of the Dragon is set in Los Angeles in a dark version of the future, circa 2053.  You play as Blade Hunter, a private investigator and retired police officer.  After a designer drug kills the mayor's rebellious daughter, Chandra, Hunter is hired to find the people responsible for releasing the drug on the streets. What Blade ultimately finds is much more than he expected.  Rise of the Dragon combines classic point-and-click adventure style with platforming arcade sequences, giving a unique gameplay combination.\nYou’ll need the latest daily build of ScummVM and files from the DOS version of the game, which you can buy at GOG (check our wiki for the required data files).  Please file any issues you notice on our bug tracker.\n>",

Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build of ScummVM. Read through our testing guidelines, and please take some screenshots along the way. If you encounter any issues, please report them to our bugtracker.\nIf you don’t own Unrest, you can purchase this game from either GOG or Steam.
