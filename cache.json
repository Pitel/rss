          "description": "Jankom Pog abides.\nIt's been a long road getting from there to here. Star Trek fans might have a whole new constellation of shows to enjoy (or complain about amitrite), but when it comes to video games the range of available options has been decidedly slimmer, especially on Nintendo systems. In fact, Star Trek: Conquest on Wii was the last time the franchise beamed onto a Nintendo platform, way back in 2007. After such a long leave of absence, it falls to Tessera Studios and the family-focused, licenced-IP-friendly publisher Outright Games to return to the final frontier with a cooperative action-puzzler based on Nickelodeon's franchise spin-off. The question is: can Star Trek Prodigy: Supernova bring the series back to Nintendo consoles with a bang?\nWell, yes and no. Any Trekkie worth their salt knows that the real appeal of the show and its umpteen spin-offs is not mapping stars or studying nebulae or modifying the main deflector to emit an inverse tachyon pulse but, instead, watching a tight-knit crew bonding over time and becoming a family as they problem-solve and perform their assigned roles with incredible competence and camaraderie. Seeing examples of this feels restorative and refreshing given the chaos of the world today, and just one of the ways in which the show gives hope for the future. Tessera has done well to drill down on a key theme of Trek — working together to overcome adversity and find smart solutions to serious problems — and divert that power directly into Supernova's core.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

In the immediate, it's about slithering out of a pod, staggering through the desert, and finding yourself in a strange, huge rotting machine made of rock and flesh that's already decades into abandonment and decay, and where most things look a bit penisy or womby. It's about the lizardy parasite latched to your back gradually transforming your body. It's about grim squishy noises and survival.\nScorn doesn't have dialogue, or a map. It doesn't really have a HUD, it doesn't have quest markers, and your character will not, upon seeing a strange new device, say something like \"Hmm... seems like a key. Maybe if I find the two missing ones, it'll open up a way forward!\" out loud. It won't even pull focus to the corridor you should check next. You just have to look around, experiment, and figure it out. I think I like it. I don't know if I can recommend it.\nRead more",

          "description": "The Ryzen 7 5800X was a great gaming CPU when it launched in 2020, and it remains one of the fastest options going despite the recent release of Ryzen 7000 processors late last month. The 5800X also has two major advantages: it works on a wide range of cheap motherboards with DDR4 RAM, and it's way cheaper than the 7700X - especially when it's discounted on Ebay US, as is the case today!\nSo: let's cut to the chase. The 5800X is down to $229.99 at Ebay, from a list price of $449, meaning it's nearly 50% off. That also makes it $170 cheaper than the equivalent Ryzen 7000 processor, the $400 eight-core Ryzen 7700X. Or, to put it another way, you're paying around 60% of the price for at least 80% of the gaming performance of that newer CPU - not bad, given that you'll also pay way less for a complete Ryzen 5000 system (with AM4 motherboards and DDR4) than a complete Ryzen 7000 one (with AM5 motherboards and DDR5). \nRead more",

          "description": "Detective games are often about filling in the blanks. A terrible crime will sit at the heart of them, yes, but most take place in the days and weeks that follow, where the bulk of your time is spent gathering clues and building a case to work out whodunnit. Rarely do you get to glimpse the immediate aftermath of the crime itself, where all the major suspects are still in play and their pockets are stuffed with incriminating evidence they'll no doubt be disposing of in the coming minutes. \nThe prime exception to this rule is Lucas Pope's Return Of The Obra Dinn, which gives you a time-travelling pocket watch to revisit the scenes of its many, many murders and work out exactly what happened to its 60-strong passenger list on its titular, ill-fated ship. Frogwares' Sherlock Holmes games and their mind palace visualisation techniques also warrant a mention here, and maybe even Outer Wilds at a push, if you count its 22-minute timeloop as an investigation scene several millennia in the making. But it's Obra Dinn that Color Gray Games emulate most strongly with their impressive debut in The Case Of The Golden Idol, which gives you a series of 12 murders to solve, each of which is presented as a freeze-frame vignette at the moment of death. You're still filling in blanks here, slotting names, objects and eventually verbs in its various scene scrolls to deduce whodunnit and howtheydunit, but this intriguing tale of 18th century high (and a secret) society, betrayals, backstabbing and murder most foul is a mystery game for the ages. \nRead more",

The way she wanted to organise keys wasn't what the game thought was the right way, and her article examined this frustration; she described the canonical correct solution as being that of a \"domestic Joker\".\nThe developers at Max Inferno Studios read this article and decided that, you know what? Alice0 was on to something. They contacted us to let us know that her piece was the inspiration for adding a feature called Let It Be, a skip puzzle function that you can access at any time. Anne Macmillan, who's a co-founder of Max Inferno Studios as well as artist and animator for A Little To The Left, was kind enough to talk to me about it.\nRead more",

Speaking of, today is the last day of the Amazon Prime Early Access Sale, which has the 1TB Blue SN570 down to £65.\nThat’s not quite its lowest price ever, but it does match its flash sale pricing during Prime Day back in July. And is an utter pittance for a 1TB NVMe SSD, let alone one that’s actually quite speedy. Amazon UK also have the 2TB version on sale for £128, just £1 more than its lowest dip on record (Prime Day 2022 again, as it happens). These prices are only available to Prime members, but the Blue SN570 ranks highly among the best SSDs for gaming, so they're well deserving of your cash if you’re in need of PC storage improvements.\nRead more",

So relevant, in fact, that I'm starting to wonder if this wasn't an attempt at psychological sabotage disguised as a friendly gesture. (You wouldn't do that to me, would you, Alice?)\nRomancelvania is exactly what it sounds like: dating sim meets Castlevania. No idea how I missed it during my own perusal of the demo list, because unsurprisingly it's immediately become my favourite thing I've ever played at a Steam Next Fest. I was so drawn in, in fact, that I've been having a tough time putting it down, even when I really need to — hence my suspicion that this was some sort of test on Alice's part. No idea if I've succeeded or failed.\nThe demo starts on a promising note, awakening you in the persona of a comically brooding and exaggeratedly shirtless hunky Dracula. (The final game will include the option to play as a Lady Drac, if you prefer, who will not be shirtless, but not by a large margin.)\n Read more",

The titular island, and your overgrown plot of farmland on it, has almost the same layout as Stardew Valley, and the tasks you do - growing stuff, keeping animals, making friends with locals, exploring a mine five levels at a time, and appeasing local spirits by giving them bundles of different crops - will also be very familiar to any DewHeads (that's what we call ourselves).\nThat's not to say Coral Island isn't good. It's all in very beautiful bouncy 3D, for one thing, and I found the island setting (which impacts the flora, fauna, and architecture in general) made everything feel less like work. Combined with a thread of environmentalism weaving through the game, and the fact that Coral Island is slightly easier than Stardew Valley, and you feel like you're doing more progress in less time. If you loved the vibe of ConcernedApe's smash hit, but found the need to hand-write your own almanac a bit intimidating, this is the game for you.\nRead more",

With the RTX 4090 and a whole family of oversized GPUs on the way, those tiny PCIe slots on your motherboard are taking on an incredible amount of weight, such that even mid-range cards can sag and bend over time. \nThe best way to prevent this is with a brace, which pushes up from the bottom of your case to the far end of the graphics card, holding it level and preventing all that force from affecting the card or the PCIe slot. You sometimes get a support brace like this free with your graphics card, but otherwise you can pick one up fairly inexpensively from a range of manufacturers. \nRead more",

          "description": "I keep forgetting Valkyrie Elysium's PC release date is later than its console one. The action platformer came out on PlayStation late last week, but it's not coming to Steam until November 11th. So far, reviews have been quite middling, which isn't wholly surprising in some sense, but having played the public demo the other week, I'm not ashamed to say that I had a pretty all right time with it! Based on two hours of play time, I'd say it's very much in the same kind of vein as your Bayonettas and Nier: Automatas, and I'm 100% down for that.\nRead more",

And all things considered, I do not miss it in the slightest. I spent so much time straining against the game's tug-of-war matches that I simply grew tired of trying really hard at it - or perhaps more accurately, trying not to launch my head through the nearest plaster wall.\nClearly, there was a time where I adored Overwatch, though. A time when I'd grind solo-queue most evenings until 3am, in a bid to climb the ranks ever higher. To what end? My own personal satisfaction, I suppose. I'd eventually hit Master (let me brag just once, okay) and then a few months later, I applied for a job at Gamer Network writing guides about Overwatch's intricacies. I moved to Brighton for my first proper job. Now, with Overwatch 2's release, it all feels like it's come full circle.\nRead more",

And while it certainly captures the same kind of atmosphere as Returnal, I'm sorry to say that's about as far as the comparison goes, as the rest of Scars Above is a much slower, more traditional kind of space action game. \nRead more",

And yet I keep coming back to Ostriv, and Workers & Resources. Neither are out of early access yet.

          "description": "Hair today, gone tomorrow\nRamping up those hyper engines beyond capacity, Nintendo has released a four-minute trailer for its long-awaited sequel Bayonetta 3, ahead of the game's October 28 launch on Nintendo Switch. The new preview features the Umbra Witch in typically fine fashion, battling alongside new and familiar allies.\nTitled \"Bayonettas Everywhere?!\" the trailer mixes fast 'n' frantic gameplay with snippets of the game's cinematics — perhaps showing a little more than is necessary, frankly. Our favorite hair-whipper is showcased battling an array of demons, monsters, and ghoulies, while tighter attention is paid to her new punk-rock protege, Viola. This young and spirited witch-in-training will accompany Bayonetta in her battle against a fearsome new enemy: the time-warping Homunculi.\nYou can check out the trailer below. Personally, I think it shows off a little too much story.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hh6bwdYgbio\nIn addition to the story and gameplay footage. The preview offers another look at the \"Demon Masquerade\" an ability that will allow the unholy one to channel various otherworldly beings — including demons Gomorrah, Malphas, and Phantasmaraneaeto — to both tweak her attack option and offer up brand-new combo routes, allowing our girl to switch up her battle abilities in the thick of the action.\nMore curiously, the trailer ends with a delightful-looking side-mode, that sees long-time Bayo pal Jeanne infiltrating a subterranean complex in delightful 2D action. The footage is reminiscent of the classic 1994 arcade release Elevator Action Returns, and is, surprisingly, one of the trailer's coolest elements. Bayonetta 3 might have teased us with the very longest of waits, but the sequel seems to be shaping up very nicely indeed. Besides, if we aren't being teased, is it even really Bayo?\nBayonetta 3 launches October 28 on Nintendo Switch.\nThe post It’s a veritable witch fest in this flashy new Bayonetta 3 trailer appeared first on Destructoid.",

The fortitude required to pull off a run like this is frankly insane, as they rarely lose their cool during the run. If you want to check out the whole process, GinoMachino has a Twitch channel, and has titled the run \"100 Punch Man.\"\nThe Godskin Duo are a tricky boss encounter, especially going in completely blind. While there are zones you can use in the arena to your advantage, and plenty of tricks/builds you can adapt to, the sheer chaos of the fight is tough to navigate your first time through. The gist is that both enemies are coming at you\nInitially, I assumed that if you defeated both of them at the same time, the encounter would end. In my first blind pre-release review playthrough, I attempted to methodically bring both of them down to roughly 10% health, then defeat both of them simultaneously. Imagine my surprise when they both revived! Oops! Once I refocused and started to figure out when to take them down (and when their second phase was advantageous to trigger), everything clicked.

Additionally, players can now pin specific challenges to the top of the list, or even snap the list to the screen, thus ensuring that the \"Collect 100 hidden items\" challenge that has been keeping you awake all night is now hanging overhead like impending danger — constantly prodding you with your abject failure.\nActivity Cards have also been tweaked in the new update, and will now be sorted into generic categories such as by game, single-and-multiplayer activities, and online/offline activities. Again, this very minor tweaking of the system hopes to help players more clearly see what tasks need — that's NEED — performing, ensuring that you never leave your couch and ultimately surrender to the television.\nPS5 software update version 22.02-06.00.01 is now live on the PS5 platform.\nThe post PlayStation 5 update adds category sorting for Trophies appeared first on Destructoid.",

NVIDIA DLSS 3 is also being supported, as are other options like DLSS 2, DLAA, and NVIDIA Reflex. And hardware-wise, Miles Morales will support ultra-wide gaming with ratios of 21:9, 32:9, or even 48:9 through triple-monitor setups.\nThat's on the extreme end of things though. According to today's PlayStation Blog, Insomniac is also supporting other configurations aside from high-end PCs; namely, portable PC gaming devices. DualSense haptics will also be supported, if you wire one in over a USB connection.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMRBuagwRb4\nA shocking spin of the web\nIf you don't own Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered, then no worries.

It's received some high praise, and I like the idea of a short, cinematic Spider-Man game to zip through.\nNice to hear that portable PC devices are a consideration too, for those who have been picking up a Steam Deck now that they're extremely available.

Several incantations have also had a power nerf, including Dragonfire, Agheel's Flame, Glintstone Breath, Smarag's Glintstone Breath, Rotten Breath, Ekzykes's Decay, Dragonice, Borealis's Mist, and Unendurable Frenzy. Finally, Ashes of War has had a power nerf across the board.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOrtKh8Vv3g\nDamage scaling has now been enabled on a separate plane for all weapons, skills, spells, and incantations used in PvP play. None of the applied changes will affect Elden Ring's single-player campaign nor its cooperative mode. All changes are restricted player for player vs player encounters. Smaller tweaks have been applied to Poise, weapon attack speeds, and a variety of spells. For a full list of patch notes, you can visit the official Elden Ring blog.\nIn somewhat more unofficial news, (as reported by VGC), Elden Ring modder Lance McDonald has already dug into the code featured in the new update, and postulates that the update contains references to maps and areas that are yet to appear in the FromSoft adventure, suggesting the possibility that a DLC expansion could be en route. Such a release would come as no surprise, given the incredible success of Elden Ring from a critical and sales standpoint. Of course, the data could merely reference previously tossed locations that were deleted before development was completed.\nElden Ring is available now on PlayStation and PC platforms.\nThe post Elden Ring update includes PvP rebalance, bug fixes, and more appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Walter and Jesse never looked so... pixelated\nBreaking Bad is one of those shows that's so good, it remains relevant almost a decade after it goes off the air. As its legacy lives on, I have to wonder if it'll ever get a true video game adaptation, maybe as a GTA-style open world, or a Telltale-style narrative adventure. There's a lot of potential there, but for now, we can continue to imagine the possibilities to tide us over. That's exactly what this fan did when they envisioned what Breaking Bad might look like if it were made to be a game for the PS1.\nThe video was created by YouTube user PotBoiler, and features over a minute of \"gameplay\" from the hypothetical PS1 title. The \"game\" opens with Walter White's classic pre-cancer chemistry lecture from the pilot. The player then takes control of Jesse, who is tasked with killing Gale before a timer runs out. As he drives through the streets, he hits another car, which gets the cops on his tail. No need to worry, though, because Jesse can just stop by Saul's place to get rid of the fuzz. Unfortunately he fails the mission, so I guess Heisenberg is dead in this alternate timeline.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfCcLyJonxA\nI wish we had more info about how PotBoiler actually made this mockup, but they did disclose in the description of the YouTube video that it was specifically inspired by GTA, so it seems we agree on what type of game would be best suited for a Breaking Bad adaptation (something the show's creator wanted as well). As per usual, I am constantly impressed by the type of fan art fans can come up with, and while this particular version looks (purposefully) janky as hell, I'd love to play a more modern version.\nCheck out some other PS1 \"demakes,\" including Horizon Zero Dawn and Bloodborne.\nThe post Someone turned Breaking Bad into a PS1 game appeared first on Destructoid.",

While Blizzard is investigating and working on them as they pop up, the company is also rolling out some rewards like double XP to make up for lost time.\nThe new version of Blizzard's team hero shooter has run into a few stumbling blocks. Players reported account and unlock issues, there was criticism of the new SMS Protect authentication, and the servers faced a few rounds of DDoS attacks. It led to frustration, and players hitting long queues trying to get in.\nAccording to a new blog post, Blizzard is continuing to roll out more stability updates, and is continuing to monitor the game. Known issues are being tracked in a thread on Blizzard's site here.\nTo \"make up for lost time\" though, there will be several Double Match XP weekends on the way. Blizzard isn't announcing when just yet.\nPlayers who log in between October 25 and the end of Season One will also get two cosmetic freebies: the Cursed Captain Legendary skin for Reaper and a Health Pack Weapon Charm. These items will be added to collections as soon as a player logs in during that window.\nhttps://twitter.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1579952100913860608\nNew age of heroes\nIt's safe to say that the launch of Overwatch 2 has been a bit rocky. Aside from the launch woes, the delivery system for new heroes via the Battle Pass and other aspects of the free-to-play monetization put a sour note on our early access review.\nThe about-face on some aspects, like foregoing SMS authentication for \"a majority\" of old Overwatch owners, at least helps.

          "description": "Subscription service the cornerstone of Xbox brand\nAccording to new statistics published by Brazil's Administrative Council for Economic Defence (CADE), celebrated subscription service Xbox Game Pass raked in a staggering $2.9 billion USD in revenue over the course of 2021. The figure was published in a CADE report on the Microsoft/Blizzard acquisition.\nThe figure, shared by TweakTown and reported by GamesIndustry.biz, offers up one of the first dollar amounts for the increasingly popular service, which offers its subscribers access to a huge library of new and classic games on both the Xbox and PC platforms. No further information about the eye-watering figure was released, with the figure focusing solely on Xbox subscribers, eschewing PC players.\nAssuming that the listed figure is accurate, Xbox Game Pass makes up something in the region of 18% of all Microsoft's Xbox revenue for 2021 — a year that generated a total revenue of just over $16 billion. The Xbox Game Pass service has continued to grow in both its userbase and its global reputation since its initial launch in the summer of 2017, and currently boasts a huge 25 million subscribers.\nEarlier this year, Sony Interactive Entertainment launched its own Game Pass competitor in the form of the revamped PlayStation Plus service, which utilizes a tier-based system to offer games from all eras of the PlayStation platform to its subscribers. Subscription gaming is fast proving itself both rewarding for the players themselves, and very profitable for the publishers, leading one to wonder whether future generations of console gaming will explore the possibilities of gaming subscriptions as a core concept.\nGame Pass reportedly made $2.9bn on consoles in 2021 [GamesIndustry.biz]\nThe post Xbox Game Pass reportedly raked in $2.9 billion in 2021 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The Paldea region's Poke-influencer is revealed\nToday's Pokemon Scarlet and Violet trailer has premiered, showcasing the debut of a new Gym Leader. Iono is an Electric-type Gym Leader in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, which launches for Nintendo Switch on November 18.\nThe new video centered on Iono and her livestream antics. The Gym Leader is also a streamer and influencer on the side. As an Electric-type Leader too, her Magnemite hair clips are a pretty cool accessory.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9HAaHc3wnc\nThe video caps off with a \"guess that Pokemon\" segment. Iono does a 20 Questions-style game where her viewers ask questions about her partner Pokemon, trying to deduce which one it might be.\nHints include the Pokemon being squishy, not being Magnemite, and being sluggish with an easy-going vibe. It has two \"big ol' bumps on its noggin\" that people mistake for eyes, and it is an Electric-type Pokemon. Its body also expands to generate electricity, and it's cute.\nHonestly, I have no clue. My bet would be that this is a tease for a future Paldean-region Pokemon reveal for Scarlet and Violet. Wiglett and Grafaiai were also teased before being fully revealed.\nPaths to Pokemon victory\nAt least we now have another Gym Leader to add to the list. We've already seen Ice-type Leader Grusha and Grass-type Leader Brassius.\nThese three, alongside the other heads of different Gyms, will make up one of Pokemon Scarlet and Violet's storylines. But there are two other ones as well.\nOn the Path of Legends, for example, you'll go off in search of rare special ingredients. And in another, you take on this generation's antagonistic crew Team Star. From a recent trailer, it seems like that will also be an area where the auto-battle mechanic will come in handy.\nIt won't be long until we have to face off against Iono and the other Gym Leaders either, as Pokemon Scarlet and Violet go live on November 18.\nThe post Here’s Iono, an Electric-type gym leader in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "There are some strings on me\nEver wanted a living Cuphead for your very own? Well, merchandiser iam8bit has the next best thing, opening pre-orders on a special Collector's Edition of Studio MDHR's excellent 2017 platformer.\nThe Cuphead Collector's Edition offers up a boxed physical copy of Cuphead — complete with its Delicious Last Course DLC — on PS4, Xbox One, or Nintendo Switch, alongside several suitably old-school goodies. These include a membership card for The Cuphead Club; six art cards or newspaper-style \"funnies\"; a sweet, hand-cranked music box; a map of the Inkwell Islands, and an exclusive outer sleeve for your game case, all of which are in keeping with Cuphead's classic cartoon style.\nThe centerpiece of the collector's edition, however, is an utterly delightful marionette of old crockery skull himself. Standing eight inches in height and sporting a weathered design, the super cute puppet will allow Cuphead fans to entertain/frighten their friends and family members with fun little performances... Or just hang him on the back of your bedroom door. Whatever works for you.\n\nAs a fun additional touch, the collector's edition box doubles as a stage, complete with an \"asbestos curtain\", so you have a charming little ramshackle display case for your new string-based pal. The marionette was designed by legendary Prague studio Rici Marionettes, with the team's loving attention to detail reflected in the model's authentic look and turn-of-the-century build.\nIt's good day for a great pre-order, and if you want in, then you can bag the Cuphead Collector's Edition over on the iam8bit website right now, priced at $199.99 USD. The box set is expected to ship in the first quarter of 2023. For those of you who are simply looking for the game itself, then standard boxed editions of Cuphead will launch on PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch on December 6.\nThe post Cuphead Collector’s Edition includes this delightful marionette appeared first on Destructoid.",

Improvements include ray-traced reflections/shadows, unlocked framerate, ultra-widescreen support, Nvidia DLSS 3/DLAA support, Nvidia Reflex, and DualSense controller support. Check it out below.\n\n\nHere are the PC specifications as well (click the image to enlarge). \nWe scored Miles Morales a 9 out of 10 when it was released in November 2020. Former editor Andrew Reiner wrote in his review that: \n\"For a second act, Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales satisfies. Taking to the web-line and soaring across a wintery New York skyline is every bit as enthralling as it was before, and Miles develops into a fantastic hero. This follow-up doesn’t have as much of a sinister punch, but it delivers some great plot twists and concludes with another eye-opening post-credits sequence that teases an exciting future for Insomniac’s Spider-Man series.\"",

          "description": "Final Fantasy VII The First Soldier, the mobile multiplayer battle royale, is being shut down in January. The news comes a month shy of the game's one-year anniversary, having launched for iOS and Android in November 2021. \nSquare Enix states that it feels it hasn’t delivered the experience it aimed for, so it will begin winding down service starting today. A roadmap on the game’s website lists a three-step sunsetting schedule. Today, you can no longer purchase Shinra credits from the shop, but you can still spend the credits you own until the game shuts down. On November 1, support for non-English localization ends (meaning text will only be displayed in English going forward). Finally, on January 11, The First Soldier goes offline for good.\nHere's the full End of Service announcement via Twitter:\nThe First Soldier was revealed in February 2021 alongside another mobile FFVII RPG, Ever Crisis (which has yet to release but has a closed beta planned for this year). The third-person battle royale took place before the events of FFVII and pit 75 players against each other as SOLDIER candidates. In addition to using firearms, players wield magic and even summons. Square previously stated The First Soldier was an attempt to attract a wider fanbase to the FFVII universe while giving existing fans a new way to enjoy its mythos. \nUnfortunately, this isn't the first Square Enix published multiplayer game to get the axe this year. Babylon's Fall, Platinum Games' live-service action RPG, is also being shutdown in February, less than a year after its ill-received launch. \nWhile The First Soldier is going away, plenty of FFVII content is in the pipeline. As previously mentioned, Ever Crisis remains on the docket, and Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion releases on December 13. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, the follow-up to Remake, is scheduled to launch next winter.",

Check out the gym leader Iono trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, there's a lot going on in this new video. Iono is very much a Paldean influencer, which is a fun addition to the universe of Pokémon, but she's also a gym leader that we'll be facing off against in the game. As for her type, it's Electric, and while not confirmed, it seems the video is hinting toward a gym challenge for her. Before actually battling her, we might have to successfully complete her \"who's that Pokémon?\" test.\nIn this instance, she describes her very own Pokémon pal, but we don't get the answer. Perhaps we're meant to know what it is based on her description or maybe she's describing a Pokémon we haven't yet met. Only time will tell. Fortunately, we don't have to wait too much longer to meet this \"Supercharged Streamer\" because Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet hit Switch on November 18. \nIn the meantime, check out this 14-minute Pokémon Scarlet and Violet gameplay trailer from last week, and then watch this video all about Wiglett, a new Diglett-like Pokémon. Check out this trailer all about competitive play after that, and then read our Pokémon Scarlet and Violet preview for more details about Paldea, Terastallizing, and more. \nDo you have an idea of which Pokémon Iono is describing in today's trailer?

          "description": "Witchfire has been one of the most promising-looking shooters since its reveal in 2017. The dark fantasy romp was slated to launch in early access later this year, but a shift in design has forced developer The Astronauts to push that launch into next year.\nThe Astronauts has decided to rework Witchfire’s arena-style combat into an open-world format. Creative director Adrian Chmielarz writes in a blog post that the change makes Witchfire a “better” game. \n“The feature is now 95% implemented. It makes the game better. It is kind of hard for me to imagine the player did not have that freedom before. Sure, you can still be trapped by the witch in this or that spot, and some doors will be closed until you find a key, and it might be too dangerous to enter areas closer to the boss before you are ready– but the world is wide open for you to explore in almost any order, and you can both push forward and retreat as you please.”\nChmielarz also teases more Witchfire news to emerge in the next week or so. It won’t be gameplay footage but rather content promoting the game’s art and world in some fashion. \nWitchfire blends gunplay with the supernatural as players wield guns and magic to fend off otherworldly threats. The game is set in an alternate reality where you’re tasked with hunting down a witch at the behest of the church. The Astronauts previously developed The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, and the studio is made up of ex-People Can Fly employees. \nWitchfire is still slated to launch on PC via The Epic Game Store in early 2023.

The company announced that the upcoming Sonic Frontiers is getting a special content pack themed after Monster Hunter. Best of all, it’s free!\nTime to get cooking!@monsterhunter DLC is coming to Sonic Frontiers November 14th, at 5pm PST - for free! pic.twitter.com/4OV4Z4LbPB\nOctober 11, 2022\nAccording to Sega’s Japanese website, the bundle features the Rioreus equipment to outfit Sonic. You’ll also get a grilled meat set, which not only lets you cook up tasty meat but also play mini-games to raise Sonic’s strength. It's a small bundle but a neat way to return the favor after Capcom introduced Sonic-themed content in Monster Hunter Rise last year. Check out Sonic in his armored glory in the photo gallery below.\n\nThe Monster Hunter pack will be available to download on November 14, almost a week after Frontiers launches on November 8.

The publisher also appears to be teasing the reveal of a new Crash game \nThe publisher sent a special Crash-themed pizza box (from \"Aku Aku's Steam-In Pizza Shack\") to influencers, such as YouTuber Candian Guy Eh. His unboxing video shows that the box is taped with a not-so-subtle message that Crash 4 heads to Steam on October 18. The game, which launched in 2020, is currently playable on PC only through Battle.net. \nAdditionally, the box was also taped with a message that read, “Hungry for more? Try our new Wumpa Pizza for $12.08!” Given that The Game Awards is set to air on December 8, it appears highly likely we’ll find out the nature of this title (rumored to be a party game called Wumpa League) during the annual show.\nAre you excited to play Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time on Steam?

If you're looking for a special Mortal Kombat announcement, though, keep your expectations in check.

Spoiler for Bayonetta 1: Cereza is the child version of Bayonetta, so perhaps our hero simply wanted to return to her adolescent roots. However, the third game's focus on the multiverse has prompted some fans to consider a more tantalizing theory. \nFirst, to provide some context, here's a (relatively) quick refresher of Bayonetta's backstory for newcomers or lapsed fans.

          "description": "EA has officially revealed Need For Speed Unbound, the first new Need For Speed game in three years, and it hits new-gen consoles and PC this December. \nAfter leaking earlier this week, EA has released the official reveal trailer for Need For Speed and as leaks and rumors suggested, it's quite a drastic shift in style for the series. It features the slick realistic visuals fans of the series know quite well but this time, it's mixed with an almost anime-like animation style. It looks great, in my opinion, but it likely won't be for everybody. \nCheck out the Need For Speed Unbound reveal trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Unbound represents a pretty drastic departure for the series in terms of visuals but elsewhere, it looks like Need For Speed. There seems to be plenty of car customization, cops to run from, city streets to speed through, and if the reveal trailer's song by A$AP Rocky is any indication, a great soundtrack.\nOnly time will tell but fortunately, we don't have to wait too long because Need For Speed Unbound hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on December 2. As you might have noticed, the reveal trailer doesn't mention consoles from the previous generation, like the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, so you might need a current-gen machine to play the game. \nAre you excited for Need For Speed Unbound?

Some players are excited about the numbered sequel while others wonder why this wasn't just a big update for the original Overwatch, which is no longer accessible. Regardless, actually playing Overwatch 2 has been its own challenge due to at least two DDoS attacks Blizzard has weathered, making it tough to actually queue into the game and access it beyond the eternal loading screen. \nOn top of that, some players have found themselves unable to play once logged in due to the game's SMS Protect system, which requires you to give Blizzard a \"unique\" phone number for authentication purposes.

          "description": "Last week, Google announced it plans to shut down Stadia on January 18. One of the less-discussed casualties of the news was that Tequila Works’ Gylt, a horror adventure game and the first Stadia-exclusive title, would disappear entirely. Thankfully, that won’t be the case.\nTequila Works has confirmed that it plans to make Gylt multiplatform in 2023. It doesn’t specify which platforms the game will become available on, but it’s a relief to know that one of Stadia’s few original gems won’t be lost to history. \n🎃 We bring terrific news: GYLT is going multiplatform in 2023! More info to come in the upcoming months.https://t.co/ON1pbiGsB9 pic.twitter.com/2sWdseym2G\nOctober 4, 2022\nGylt launched in November 2019 alongside Stadia. It stars a young girl named Sally who searches for her missing cousin across a town haunted by evil spirits. The narrative also serves a commentary on bullying and depresssion. The game’s vibe and art direction evoke films like Coraline or Tim Burton’s animated works and channels games like Inside and Silent Hill. Gameplay emphasizes stealth, with players using a flashlight to defeat enemies. Despite its more innocent veneer, the game has its share of genuinely creepy moments, and I personally found it to be an enjoyable horror romp.\nWill you be checking out Gylt before Stadia shuts down or wait to play it elsewhere next year?

          "description": "Sony announced its new gaming loyalty program, PlayStation Stars, back in July, and the service is now live in North and South America. PlayStation users can sign up for the free program, but there’s one big caveat.\nPlayStation Stars allows players to earn points and digital collectibles by completing “campaigns,” which range from completing small objectives while playing games to larger monthly challenges. Any PlayStation player can join Stars; you don’t need a Plus subscription. \nCompleting campaigns also raises your Star Status, a leveling system consisting of four ranks. Everyone begins at Level 1, but doing things like purchasing games from PSN or earning a certain number of trophy rarities raises this level, increasing the quality of rewards you earn. \nDigital rewards, which Sony confirmed are not NFTs and cannot be resold, include models of old PlayStation consoles and characters from first-party titles. You can also redeem points to use as funds for your digital store wallet and to purchase DLC. Points remain available for 24 months after earning them. \nIf you’re running to sign up now, there’s already a waitlist to join PS Stars. Sony states that new users will have to wait about two months after the date they register to be accepted into the program. It's unclear why this is the case, but one could assume Sony doesn't want to be flooded with too many memberships at once as it gradually gets the program off the ground. Registration also doesn't seem consistent yet, as some folks were immediately let in while others have been told to wait (and some others still can't access Stars in parts of the U.S. as of publishing). \nPlayStation Stars will launch in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand next week on October 13. To learn more about the program, including its handy FAQ, you can visit its official site here.",

To accompany today's news, Bandai Namco has released a new trailer showcasing some of DBZ's most iconic moments alongside some comparison clips between the PlayStation 4/Xbox One version of Kakarot and the upcoming new-gen update. Unsurprisingly, it looks a lot better. \nCheck it out for yourself below: \n\n\nKakarot on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S features updated visuals that look even better than the original release and 60 frames-per-second gameplay. If you already own the game, you can upgrade to the new-gen version of Kakarot for free. \nThis new trailer also teases what's to come in the game's second season pass. The first DLC is called Bardock: Alone Against Fate, and it's a new story arc. Two more story arc DLCs are in the season pass as well. Plus, Season Pass 2 owners will get a cooking item that increases HP and Ki defense. \nWhile waiting for January, read Game Informer's Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot review to find out why we think the game is flawed but still highly enthralling. \nAre you going to check out the new-gen version of Kakarot next year?

The two discuss how the game runs and looks on Switch, how the experience holds up five years after its original release, and whether Nier Automata is still worth playing all these years later. \nWhile Nier Automat has, over the year, hit PlayStation and Xbox consoles, as well as PC, it has yet to reach a Nintendo platform...that is until this Thursday, October 6, when The End of YoRHa Edition is released. As for what to expect, this new edition of Nier Automata includes the following:\nNier Automata base game\nAll previously released DLC\nNew costumes exclusive to Switch\nIf you're wondering whether Switch is the platform to play this on for newcomers, or if you're wondering whether this new release is worth a replay, we have you covered in the latest New Gameplay Today, which you can watch below.

Likely the most crucial moment to readers of Game Informer was the debut of the Nintendo Entertainment System.\nThe NES pulled the burgeoning industry out of the “video game crash” and introduced countless iconic characters and franchises. It seemed like every hit property received a game at the time. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Top Gun, DuckTales, Dungeons & Dragons, American Gladiators: the list goes on and on. However, one iconic brand shockingly never made the transition into a NES game.\nGarbage Pail Kids, which also debuted in 1985, was a trading card series that mixed the cuteness of the hit Cabbage Patch Kid…",

But it is a new image showcasing our first look at the famed plumber in the Mushroom Kingdom of this movie, which is being made by Minions studio Illumination Entertainment. This image accompanies the announcement of a Nintendo Direct happening this Thursday, October 6, all about the movie. Nintendo specifically points out that there will be no video game news, however, so don't expect anything more than Super Mario Bros. \nTune in at 1:05 p.m. PT on 10/6 for a #NintendoDirect: The Super Mario Bros. Movie presentation introducing the world premiere trailer for the upcoming film (no game information will be featured).\nhttps://t.co/I868SmSpV2 pic.twitter.com/hqlO0SfLbe\nOctober 4, 2022\nHere's a better look at it, too, courtesy of the film's first poster:\nAs you can see, this image reveals quite a lot. There's Toad, an antiques stall selling relics of Mario's past video games, plenty of pipes and platforms, and of course, Princess Peach's castle high above the rest of the kingdom. There's probably plenty more to glean from the image so have at it. \nThis image is our first look at the movie, but during the Direct on Thursday, which begins at 1:05 p.m. Pacific/4:05 p.m. Eastern, Nintendo will formally introduce the movie with the first-ever world premiere trailer, so be sure to tune in. \nSuper Mario Bros. hits theaters on April 7, 2023.\nWhile waiting for this Thursday direct, read about how Nintendo is reportedly happy with the film and so happy, that additional Nintendo movies are likely on the way. Read about how Chris Pratt says his Mario voice is \"unlike anything you've heard in the Mario world\". After that, then check out this story about how a producer from the movie says Mario won't have an Italian accent in the film. \nWhat do you think Chris Pratt's Mario will sound like?

          "description": "Sony might be interested in helping produce movies and television shows based on From Software games. \nThis news comes by way of a new interview between Reuters and PlayStation Studios head Hermen Hulst, in which Hulst explains PlayStation's investments into its PC and mobile efforts as of late, as well as its recent investment into Elden Ring developer From Software. According to Hulst, \"further investments in areas that will strengthen the expansion on to PC, on to mobile, and into live services\" is definitely a possibility for PlayStation. \n\n\nHowever, more interesting to From Software fans perhaps is Hulst's answer when asked about Sony's investment in the studio. \n\"You should think of collaborations on the game development side first and foremost, but it's also not unthinkable with our PlayStation Productions efforts that we explore opportunities,\" he said. \nWhile Sony has a 14.09% stake in From Software, that's not quite enough to make decisions independent of the studio's other investors, like Tencent, which acquired 16.25% of From Software around the same time Sony invested. So while PlayStation Productions might be interested in a Bloodborne horror movie one day or an Elden Ring TV series about Jar Bairn, for example, From Software and its other investors would likely need to give the green light as well. Here's hoping, though, because From Software's properties, be it Bloodborne, Elden Ring, Dark Souls, or something else, seem ripe for an on-screen adaptation. \nWhile waiting to see if anything comes of this, read about how Bloober Team is making a TV series adaptation and then read about how Sony is developing God of War, Gran Turismo, and Horizon screen adaptations after that. \n[Source: Reuters]\nWhat is your dream From Software movie or TV series?
