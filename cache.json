          "description": "One that shouldn't be mist.\nA few years ago, developers Adglobe and Live Wire (which, fun fact, also developed Harvestella) released a Metroidvania called Ender Lilies: Quietus of the Knights to high praise. Combining a heavy atmosphere with tough, Soulslike combat in a dark fantasy world, it stood out as a notably quality addition to a genre that feels like it gets at least one new entry every week. The sequel, Ender Magnolia: Bloom in the mist, is a strong iteration on its predecessor's formula. It's everything a Metroidvania should be and, even if it’s not exactly revolutionary, it executes its vision well.\nEnder Magnolia is set a number of years after Ender Lilies, placing you in the role of Lilac, a young girl who awakens from a long slumber in a strange and decaying world. What’s left of society is occupied by two different races: humans and the creepy machines called Homunculi. Some Homunculi could easily pass as human while others have much more monstrous or animalistic traits, and all are susceptible to corruption from a mysterious mist called fumes. Luckily, Lilac happens to be an Attuner—someone who can directly purify corrupted Homunculi—so you set out on a journey to uncover her lost memories and do what you can to set the world straight.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Nothing we haven't seen before, but still a good bit of fun. That is unless you want to play some of the later stages in co-op, it seems, because fans have discovered an oversight that sucks all the fun out of platforming with your pals (thanks for the heads up, GamingReinvented).\nAs shared on YouTube by the wonderfully named DK fan channel, Kong Kompendium, Returns HD has a problem with its co-op combat: two players can't bounce off the same enemy. It might not sound that weird on paper (heck, Mario does it all the time), but such an ability becomes pretty crucial as you progress into the game's later stages — where bouncing on enemies is the only way to proceed — making a full co-op run on Switch far from ideal.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

You also can’t miss its regular performance hiccups, which most often manifest as little but frequent stutters that occur as you’re moseying around its poorly planet. \nOr can you? News comes via Nic himself that modder FrancisLouis, whose previous works include performance-enhancing rejigs of various games (and one that turns the Silent Hill 2 remake’s pipe weapon into a rigid, A-posing wife), has produced Fantasy Optimizer: an overhaul of how FF7 Rebirth handles shaders and streamed visuals. Both Nic and myself have tried it out on our respective rigs, and it works! Mostly.\nRead more",

          "description": "Has any genus of graphics card been as dramatically storied as the GeForce XX80s? The RTX 3080 was a thing of beauty, only to be tarnished by the worst wheeler-dealing spree (and crypto mining misappropriation) in PC component history. Then the RTX 4080 rocked up with its laughable £1269 / $1199 price tag, a miscalculation so severe that the RTX 4080 Super looked good – despite hardly being any faster – simply for not repeating it. For the new RTX 5080’s sake, you almost want it to be boring.\nIt isn’t. But then, neither is it a blood-boiler like the RTX 4080, nor a largely aspirational show-off piece like the RTX 5090. By maintaining the 4080 Super’s course correction on price while tooling up on compelling DLSS 4 improvements, the RTX 5080 is an agreeable GPU from the off. Particularly, if you’ve got the 4K monitor to take full advantage of it.\nRead more",

Dazzling and exhausting. What was once a relatively (and to some extent unintentionally) lean procgen exploration sim has swelled into a game of mechs, fishing, fickle weather systems, intricate asteroid engagements, starbases, nautiloids and capes.

The Maw letter opener differs from regular letter openers in that when you open a letter with it, you will encounter not a letter but a perfect copy of yourself opening a letter in the opposite direction. The two of you must now fight to the death to decide who is the letter-opener and who is the letter. It's yours for a piffling three pints of any available body fluid, but if you don't want to buy a letter opener you can always buy one of this week's new PC games instead.\r\n \nRead more",

It has generally more consistent framerates than FFXVI, which could bait you in with silky visuals before grabbing your head and shoving it into the cold ice bath of sub-30fps.\nYet it also steps back from that game on its supported tech, while raising its hardware requirements so far above Final Fantasy 7 Remake that it won’t even launch on a lot of older graphics cards. Even so, hitching and microstuttering issues from FF7 Remake return once more, along with plenty of other signs that this PC version didn’t get the love that a lot of other erstwhile PlayStation exclusives – like Horizon Forbidden West or God of War Ragnarök – did for their ports.\nRead more",

          "description": "We called Amplitude's fiendish and fanciful strategy game Endless Legend the best 4X of 2014, and its hexcellence hasn't dimmed with age. \"The music, the amazing variety in terrain and units, the sheer quantity of words bringing to life every last quest, minor faction, creature, and environmental anomaly,\" breathed a reverential Ollie in 2023. \"It's a simply splendid game.\" Like somebody commenting on the sturdiness of an original Picasso's frame, I will only add that it now runs pretty comfortably on the current least expensive Dell Thinkpad.\nWhy in Meier's name would Sega choose to sell off the studio behind such a worldly wonder? The answer is lost in time (it's through that link, there), but fortunately, Amplitude endure as an independent - and they've just announced Endless Legend 2 with no less than Hooded Horse as publisher.

Between its multiple release date delays in response to Star Wars Outlaws not selling as well as Ubisoft would've liked, and Ubi potentially being bought by Tencent as they clamour for help, there's a sense that Shadows needs to deliver not only a great game, but corporate redemption.\nI've now played Shadows for four hours, having dipped into a bit of prologue action, some open world exploration, and a questline as both the hulking Yasuke and the lithe Naoe. Have Ubi delivered? I think there's a strong chance. What I played was a lot of comforting Creeding, carried along by a gorgeous interpretation of Edo Japan, and some subtle tweaks to up stealth stakes. Although I do think the two protagonists are a split personality that doesn't quite work for me.\nRead more",

          "description": "Readers, I have spent two full days in the benchmark pits to tell you what you've already guessed: the GeForce RTX 5090 is very fast, too expensive, and laden with more AI tech than Philip K. Dick’s cheese dreams. At least two of those points will, I’m sure, send the average graphics card shopper running, especially at a time when even game developers are growing suspicious of generative AI and its many-thumbed, robot-voiced nostrums.\nYet while there’s not much to be done about the RTX 5090 costing at minimum £1939 / $1999, hundreds more than the infamously spenny RTX 4090, its suite of more purely performance-focused artificial intelligence tools is – dare I say it – quite neat. These range from Multi Frame Generation (MFG), which is basically DLSS 3 frame gen but up to twice as fast, to DLSS 4’s general upscaling enhancements and even the ability to apply newer DLSS versions to older games. All this will come to the rest of the RTX 50 series as well, with some trickling down to the enter RTX range, so maybe the RTX 5090 is best understood not as a practical GPU purchase in itself but as a Picadilly Square-filling advert for its more affordable siblings can do.\nRead more",

          "description": "This review contains some story spoilers for the original FF7 and subsequently some elements of Rebirth, but doesn't spoil how Rebirth ultimately reinterprets these elements. \nI argued with myself for several weeks in university about whether to go to a seminar discussing T.S. Eliot's The Love Song Of J. Alfred Prufrock. The poem meant enough to me that I didn't want to dissect it with a class. I wanted to keep for myself. I went in the end, and though I hesitated, I talked because I had things to say. It didn't kill the poem for me, but it does have a slightly awkward gait now, having never quite recovered from the incisions.\nI now have to etherise Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth. Cait Sith is splayed upon a table. It's all scalpels, forceps, and oversized novelty dice. It's a strange way to treat art you love. The feeling I remember most from Rebirth on release is how grateful I felt to be alive to play it. Acute, active awareness of my own mortality with thoughts like \"it would be properly shit if I died right now because I'd really like to see how this pans out\". A personal 'never kill yourself' moment months before the meme gave voice, as the best often do, to an obscure and precious feeling.\nAn RPG where your character sometimes knocks on doors before opening them? What a time to be alive.\nRead more",

This time, the culprit is Matthew Ball of analyst firm Epyllion, who remarks in a sprawling State Of Videogaming 2025 report that \"some gamemakers hope GTA 6 will be priced at $80-$100 [in the USA], breaking the $70 barrier and helping $50 titles to move up to $60, $60 to $70, $70 to $80, etc.\"\nPicked up by VGC, these comments have now been circulated on social media, and have attracted the extremely polarised mixture of responses you're probably expecting. Among those chipping in is Larian's director of publishing Michael Douse, who makes the familiar argument that overall prices for games like GTA aren't necessarily higher today when you factor in economic inflation, while also acknowledging that up-front price alone doesn't explain the industry's recent mass livelihood devastation, and that few people would happily pay that much for a video game - not even Our Lord In Open Worlding GTA.\n Read more",

The bite-sized two-player shooter was one of our favourite games of last year, summoning the fast-paced killthrills of ancient Quake servers as much as the quickfire 1v1 scraps of the gulag in Call of Duty: Warzone. And now it has a bunch of new maps. Not content with making the powerful pew-pew 'em up completely free (WHAT), the developers have added new weapons, features and a further 30 bullet-pocked arenas. And look, an icy and divisive fan-made map of ye olde Counter-Strike appears among them.\nRead more",

          "description": "Like many JRPG series, it feels as if the Tales Of series has made strides in popularity in recent years. Both 2016's Tales Of Berseria and 2021's Tales Of Arise had charming worlds and flashy combat, and the latter has found a home on our picks for the best of the genre.\r\n\nNow the series is adopting the other dominant JRPG trend of late: remakes and remasters. Tales Of Graces f Remastered, a revision of the 2009 entry in the series, is out now.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Facebook owners Meta, Amazon, Walmart, McDonalds and others are reportedly scaling back their DEI initiatives to stave off backlash or litigation from conservative pundits and politicians, who regard DEI guidance about discrimination as a form of discrimination in itself. Following the election, I've also noticed a couple of video game company executives express misgivings about DEI - misgivings that, amongst other things, illustrate that \"DEI\" has come to mean a lot more than just annual training about micro-aggressions.\n  \nRead more",

Alongside this is a new trailer to give you a peek at what you’re getting into.\n\n\nIt’s a bit hard to get a good read on what Phantom Line really is, so let’s start from the top. It’s a first-person shooter for 1-4 players, set in an open-world environment. You’re an operative for a megacorporation who has been dispatched into an Eastern European country following a nuclear war. Okay, sounds familiar.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, there’s also something called the H.U.S.K. that allows you to transfer your consciousness between artificial bodies. The trailer doesn’t really capture that very well, but there’s a gif on the store page that shows it in action. Maybe.\n\n\nPhantom Line promises an open world full of dynamic events. You and your friends get a derelict ship as a base of operations and can show off your loot. There’s also crafting, because an artificial army runs on its stomach, so you have to eat. The trailer shows a suspicious amount of bear violence, so you may be eating something pretty gamey.\n\n\nTo get in on the Phantom Line playtest, you’ll need to sign up for their discord at this link here.

The free perk can be obtained from the Ossuary Area in The Tomb, and it can be highly beneficial in the long run.\n\n\nLet's take a look at how you can complete this Easter Egg in The Tomb.\n\n\nHow to complete the free perk Easter Egg in Black Ops 6 Zombies\n\n\nBefore we begin the process, you must have a player level of at least 6. You'll need the Napalm Burst Ammo Mod, and this item unlocks at level 6. If you're just a beginner, make sure to complete a couple of games quickly, and you should fit the requirements.\n\n\nOnce you load into the game and start a fresh round in The Tomb, try to find the Arsenal Machine. From here, you'll be able to purchase any mod you want, but make sure to get the Napalm Burst Ammo Mod. Next, keep clearing the zombies till you can reach the Ossuary region.\n\n\nYou'll come across six unlit lamps in the Ossuary region. They can be found on the sides of the three doorways, and they are shot at with the weapon that has the Napalm Burst Ammo Mod. Once you have shot and put all lamps on fire, you'll get a random perk for free.\n\n\n\n\nThe free perk will be completely random, so they might not be the best possible fit. However, it's always helpful to have any resource for free as you try to clear as many hordes of Zombies as possible.\n\n\nIf you're still learning the secrets of The Tomb, make sure to go through the main campaign Easter Egg guide, which will help you to get and upgrade the Ice Staff.\n\nThe post Black Ops 6 Zombies: Free Perk Easter Egg guide appeared first on Destructoid.",

Of course, Future Stars will be a returning campaign, as it was available in EA FC 24 as well. So far, EA Sports has remained tight-lipped about their plans, but certain cards have already been leaked.\n\n\nAll EA FC 25 Future Stars promo players (leaks)\n\n\nIt appears that EA Sports will be following last year's structure with the Future Stars promo. In simpler words, there will be special cards for both active footballers and former legends. The leaks, as of writing, might be limited, but some interesting names have already popped up.\n\n\n\nLamine Yamal\n\n\nXabi Alonso CDM 91\n\n\nLucas Beraldo\n\n\nJohann Cruyff\n\n\n\nOut of all the cards leaked so far, we have confirmation about Alonso's overall rating and potential. Details about the remaining leaks are unavailable at the time of writing. They will be updated once we have more information in the lead-up to the release.\n\n\nEA FC 25 Future Stars promo release date\n\n\nThe TOTY cards are going to be available in packs till Friday, January 31. That's the same day the Future Stars promo is expected to go live in Ultimate Team. The new cards will be available in packs, and it's safe to expect some of the items to be made available via objectives and SBCs.\n\n\nSo far, we have no confirmation about whether Future Stars will be a one-week or two-week-long promo. It will also be interesting to find out if EA Sports will reintroduce the Academy Stars Evolution. Last year, we were able to upgrade six different items of our choice with massive upgrades. It will certainly be a cool addition for those who miss out on getting a TOTY item.\n\nThe post EA FC 25 Future Stars promo leaks and release date appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, not many of them have been successful, and for a good reason: most of them were unpolished or too rushed. Now, we have a game that might break that trend and prove to be one of the finest RPG experiences out there. So, get ready for the Jujutsu Odyssey release date with the info below.\n\n\nWhen is The Jujutsu Odyssey Release Date?\n\n\n\n\nJujutsu Odyssey is set to release on all platforms on February 2nd at 5:30 PM CST. The developers had been relatively quiet for a long time before the official date was announced. However, they released several previews of in-game mechanics and a lot of #sneak-peeks on the official Jujutsu Odyssey Discord server. With that in mind, we believe the game can be full of content and a joy to play right from the start.\n\n\nJujutsu Odyssey Limitless Customization Trailer\n\n\n\n\nBefore the release, The owner of Jujutsu Odyssey, Artist 3.0, posted several previews on his official YouTube channel. We expect more previews in the following days. Still, as of writing this article, you can get a glimpse of some of the customization options and several special techniques available on release.\n\n\nHow to Get Early Access to the Jujutsu Odyssey?\n\n\nAt the moment, there hasn't been any news about early access in Jujutsu Odyssey. However, there is an ongoing invite event through which you can get permanent Tester access. Besides the access itself, the winners will also get $10,000 Robux and a Cursed Technique of their choice. The event is hosted in the #event-notice channel on the official Discord server, so make sure to check it out.\n\n\nAnd with that, you should be ready for the upcoming release of Jujutsu Odyssey.

Once you find the third and final one, the song will start playing in the background. Let's take a look at how you can complete the Music easter egg in The Tomb.\n\n\nAll Black Ops 6 Music Easter Egg Headphone locations\n\n\nHere are the locations of all three headphones, and it's recommended that you find them in the given order. That way, you'll save a lot of time and won't have to roam haphazardly across the map.\n\n\nHeadphone 1: Speed Cola Room\n\n\nImage via Reddit/iconsumesnow\n\n\nThe first headphone is located near some skeletal remains in the Speed Cola room. In this room, you'll find the skeletal remains to your right, and the headphones will be playing music from them. You can also find a GobbleGum Machine at this location, and there are three new additions.\n\n\nHeadphone 2: Stamin Up Room\n\n\nImage via Reddit/iconsumesnow\n\n\nThe second one is located in the Stamin Up room. Go inside the room and turn left, and you'll find the Stamin Up machine. You'll find a statue in this room with a ledge near it. The headphones can be found on this ledge.\n\n\nHeadphone 3: Portal\n\n\nImage via Reddit/iconsumesnow\n\n\nIf you follow the main questline in The Tomb, it will take you to a glowing lotus. You'll have to interact with it to open the portal. Once you head inside the portal, you'll find a glowing plant, and the headphones will be located near it.\n\n\nOnce you have found the last piece, you'll hear something pretty cool playing in the background in The Tomb.

This includes the original The Sims which was released for PC, and the highly rated sequel, The Sims 2. Electronic Arts might have previously just left these titles to rot, but not anymore.

On average, games protected by anti-tamper tech Denuvo enjoy 68 days crack-free before succumbing to piracy. Yet new research focused on MAME (Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator) and video game preservation, reveals that a sample of 712 protected games, released as far back as 1979, took an average of 10.6 months each to crack. Total cracking time: 628 years. \nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",

Telefonica's cooperation was to be expected, as it just obtained the rights to broadcast LaLiga matches for 1.2 billion euros. In contrast, details of an anti-piracy agreement between the two companies, one that seems to operate in the opposite direction, wasn't expected at all.\nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",

Hudebně vychází z původní lidové písně a již dávno zažité sestupné basové linky původně inspirované čardášem. V monumentální instrumentaci zaznívá důstojné a bohaté \"hradní\" Maestoso s výraznou smyčcovou figurací a dramatické Presto s vypjatým protihlasem tak kontrastně jako dunajské nížiny a Vysoké Tatry. Důvodem vzniku bylo hledání krásy a síly slovenské hudby s duchovním nadhledem mně tolik blízké mahlerovské angažovanosti.
