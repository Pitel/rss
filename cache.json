          "description": "Like a drag-on.\nOpen-world games have evolved a lot in the 19 years since the original Yakuza was released. Quirky fetch quests and meandering storytelling were often characteristics of the genre, as was the sense that the developers were gleefully mashing together ideas and holding everything together with an offbeat sense of humour. It’s a positive, then, that this 2017 remake, Yakuza Kiwami, now released on the Switch, updated and modernised much of the 2005 original, so much so that they’re effectively two distinct games.\nFor example, the remake completely overhauls the original’s fixed-perspective, Resident Evil-style Tokyo streets. The 2005 game featured just one combat style, while the remake has four — Rush, Brawler, Beast, and Dragon — a development first seen in a similar way in the much-superior 2015 prequel Yakuza 0. The game’s story was also significantly fleshed out by developing an important subplot concerning the game’s tragic antagonist, Nishiki.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Their forthcoming Love Eternal is the story of Maya, a girl whisked off to a \"castle built of bitter memories\" by a weird, lonely god, and obliged to make her way \"through over 100 screens filled with spikes, lasers, switches, and traps\".\nWhen not getting spiked or lasered, Maya appears to spend her days in a kind of metaphorical suburban household. Here, she will contend with things like people crawling on the ceiling and coming over all Babadook. Maya does have one major advantage: the ability to reverse gravity. Watch her put that ability to use in the new trailer.\n Read more",

Shadows Of The Damned's Xbox 360/PS3 release may slip into either camp, depending on whether you liked it back in the day or not. It's a third-person action adventure where two famous video game folks joined forces: No More Heroes' Suda51 and Resident Evil's Shinji Mikami. And to my knowledge, it's considered a bit of a cult classic.\nSo, having played Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered after never experiencing the original, do I think it's any good? If you were a fan of the OG, there's no doubt you'll like it. If you're coming in as a newbie, I think it's refreshing in the sense it's a trim throwback with some interesting ideas and middling-to-good execution. But its whole schtick isn't only a product of its time - it's actually downright yucky.\nRead more",

The project was eventually canceled and adapted into 2013’s The Bureau: XCOM Declassified, but Irrational co-founder and current Wild Bastards studio Blue Manchu founder Jon Chey has shed some light on the FPS’s development, and it sounds like it was once a far more ambitious project.

It successfully combines that rich screen with oodles of input features and Deck-thrashing performance, though between its high price and a downright vampiric thirst for battery juice, it’s definitely more of a specialist tool than a crowd-pleasing portable.\nRead more",

It's got a pleasant upstairs-downstairs vibe.

This puzzle-solving sequel, Wilmot Works It Out, doesn't come packaged with its predecessor's wry humour, nor the same sense of compulsion. Instead, it exudes a calm and homely sense of idle comfort. For me, that ultimately makes it less compelling, even if it is thematically the entire point. This is about a warehouse worker doing jigsaws on his day off.\nRead more",

In case you're unfamiliar, Denuvo's wares have become infamous for allegedly sabotaging the performance of all sorts of video games, from Resident Evil: Village to Tekken 7, though accounts of the severity vary, and there is an on-going shortage of independently supplied raw data. \nDenuvo's attempts to clear the air include opening a Discord, which they say “ is a key step in fostering closer relationships with game developers, publishers, and players, offering a dynamic, real-time platform for meaningful interaction”. On Monday, Denuvo’s media team reached out to me to offer an interview with Denuvo’s product manager, Andreas Ullmann. Here’s that interview, edited for brevity. \nRPS: In a recent public statement you said “we will stop letting every claim about our product go unanswered\". What claims are you referring to?\nAndreas Ullmann: It's basically really about the stuff that's posted by the community. So you just need to check out Steam forums, for example. Very toxic, very hostile environment. If a game announces to use any of our products, if you check out the Steam forums, all the claims are popping in. SSDs are destroyed by our solution. The usual performance topics, and we simply don't want to leave the floor to these people who are posting all things about us anymore. We want to also be there for a person who has not heard about us before. We also want to share our view, our opinion on these topics, and also act as a trusted source of information.\nRead more",

At least, I think he's an odd flag-bearer for a series of games where you live out a nostalgic, Japanese summer in the countryside.\nAnd I think it's doubly weird that Shin chan: Shiro And The Coal Town opts for a collectathon approach, that doesn't necessarily make the act of living out a Cicada Summer all that mesmerising. But, and this is a big but: I can't stop thinking about it. Of all the games of 2024, Coal Town may have left the biggest impression on me. In a way, I hope it does for you, too.\nRead more",

You're a kid who's playing a legendary 8-bit game that's said to be possessed by evil spirits.

Try to strafe left to dodge an attack from a blubber monster, and you’ll instead rotate on the spot. Attempt to turn the camera with a flick of the mouse, and you’ll discover that your view remains fixed in place - the cursor moving across the screen as if searching for an icon on your desktop.\n\"The controls are actually one of the biggest points that make people bounce off the game,\" developer Raphael Bossniak admits.\nAnd yet they’re also a unique selling point. Where last year’s extraordinary System Shock remake embraced the interface and keyboard conventions of modern gaming, Sonar Shock leans into the experimentation of pre-Quake control schemes - long before WASD and mouselook became standardised for the sake of ease and sanity.\nRead more",

While Intel gear up to release their efficiency-focused Core Ultra 200S chips, AMD have announced a November 7th launch date for their Ryzen 9000X3D series – the latest to use their framerate-juicing 3D V-Cache. No specific CPUs have been named, for some reason, but we can be reasonably sure from leaks and retail listing whoopsies that this launch will include at least one of the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, Ryzen 9 9900X3D, and Ryzen 9 9950X3D.\nRead more",

It'll cost $30 on Steam, Itch, and GOG.   \r\n\r\nOriginal story: The Caves Of Qud developer has posted a cryptic riddle that sounds a bit like a release date in disguise. A post on the game's Steam page yesterday reads: \"{n} purple wardens beseech the Chair, What is death, if one rose is fair? How long from beetle moon to beetle moon?\" That means absolutely nothing to me. But at least one fan in the comments knows their lore enough to have translated it, resulting in a specific date later this year. If their solution is correct, this could be a characteristically cryptic way for developer Freehold Games to announce the date for the roguelike's 1.0 release. So, let's double check those numbers.\n Read more",

          "description": "Back in the protean stink of 2013, the beast we call Factorio sprouted in lowercase early access form and began its meticulous, ravenous conquest of the emerging factory sim genre. Some say that Factorio gave that genre life, though I'd point at Dwarf Fortress as one among many notable forebears. Today, the terrain of factory simming is hotly contested by rival piles of conveyor belt spaghetti. I'm not just talking about Satisfactory or Shapez - they're even making philosophical factory sims these days. They have cosy factory sims now.\nAccordingly, the immense, smoke-rimmed cyborg eye of Factorio has turned from the exhausted soil to the relatively untapped heavens. Somewhere up there, there is unspoilt territory. Somewhere, there is land that has never known the roar of a smelter - and in Factorio's behemothic Space Age DLC, out today, you will find it.\n Read more",

Edders had a dream, the dream of Halo Infinite getting a battle royale mode. Like Moses descending from the mount with a Needler in either hand, he bedazzled and amazed us with visions of \"an enormous playground stitched together from some of Halo's most iconic maps of yore; Warthogs and Mongooses roaming the lands; players racing to the M41 SPNKR as it spawns; grappling to a rooftop and laying down covering fire; some contrived reason as to why there's a circle of poison gas closing in... but hey, rings are what Halo does best, right? It's 100% doable.\"\nEd Thorn has always been a journalist of great sagacity and supernatural insight, so it was of no surprise to the RPS editors of the era when rumours bubbled up a few months later that Certain Affinity had partnered with 343 Industries (nowadays Halo Studios) to make Halo battle royale a reality. These rumours have now been confirmed by Certain Affinity's former design director Mike Clopper, who says the now-cancelled mode could have been a \"game changer\".\n Read more",

OK, I'll bite - what's a county-builder then? Well, it's sort of several city-builders having an argument. In County Of Fortune, you seed and grow a number of settlements side by side, then manage their economic and social relations. In other words, it's a game that appears to simulate the phenomenon of culture clash. I'm not sure all this amounts to the wholesale death of a genre, but it's certainly intriguing.

Assuming Breslau's sources are accurate, it's a great demonstration of Twitch's tolerance for streamers with big audiences, the kind of slap on the wrist you'd expect from a platform that recently reinstated Donald Trump's account after banning him in 2021 for the charge of inciting an insurrection.\n Read more",

I had expected a little more, but what’s here has certainly given me some optimism that the full game might well be worth sinking - if not months - at least more time than it takes to wildly lunge at a few nazis en route to your objective.\nRead more",

As we ramp up for 1999, we have one more to get before its launch.\n\n\nThat being said, since we know Xaku Prime is coming out, what is coming alongside them, and what other tidbits of information should you know?\n\n\nWhen does Xaku Prime release in Warframe?\n\n\nXaku Prime will be released on November 13, 2024. They will be obtainable in-game via the Relic system, by purchasing parts from other players who farmed, or by buying Prime Access.\n\n\nIf you want to obtain Xaku Prime right away but don’t want to buy Prime Access, start stocking up on Platinum now so you can trade it with others who obtain the parts on day one. Just note that prices will be inflated!\n\n\nCrafting components will not be known until release day, so check back once we know more.\n\n\nImage via Digital Extremes\n\n\nWhat weapons will come with Xaku Prime?\n\n\nXaku Prime’s weapons will be the Quassus Prime and Trumna Prime.\n\n\nThe Quassus Prime may rival the power of the meta Gunsen Prime. Its base version already sports very strong critical stats with decent status. In terms of where it currently is in the meta, it’s already up there alongside other Prime melee weapons. The new stats the Prime variant will have is to be determined.\n\n\nAs for the Trumna Prime, we already know it will be a beast of an explosive LMG. Since it has strong stats overall with innate Heat damage, the Prime is only going to increase all that even further, defining power creep.\n\n\nXaku Prime cosmetics\n\n\nIf you purchase the Prime Accessories version of the Xaku Prime Access, you’ll get the Artifex Prime Syandana and Necra Prime Operator suit. These can only be obtained by purchasing the pack; they cannot be obtained via farming in-game.\n\n\nAlong with buying this pack, you’ll also get a 90-day affinity and resource booster.\n\nThe post Warframe: Xaku Prime release date, Prime weapons, and more appeared first on Destructoid.",

Previously, it was only available on PS2 and GameCube, and the game is just too weird and important to languish on those consoles. The port was decent.

          "description": "If you, like me, have spotted the #MCAA hashtag popping up on Twitter and TikTok, you likely weren't able to guess it refers to Minecraft's very own college football league. The MCAA name is a spoof of the NCAA acronym, so it stands for Minecraft Collegiate Athletic Association.\n\n\nNow, the thing is, MCAA isn't a real football league. It's a new trend where Minecraft players use the game's tools to create or spoof teams, games, and hilarious college football highlights.\n\n\n\n\nSo, instead of actual teams like Old Miss or Virginia Tech, you have teams such as the Ole Moo and Pig State, which, let's be honest, could very well pass for real team names. As most of these teams are named after animals, their fanbase and players also tend to be composed of said animal.\n\n\n\n\nThe MCAA has Minecraft players creating their own matches and leagues that they'll then post on TikTok. This has, unsurprisingly, already spawned very serious and important drama that spread to other parts of everyday life:\n\n\n\n\nAnd the drama happens on and off the pitch. If we're to take this random guy on Twitter as a veritable source, some of these teams have stadiums that cost over ten billion dollars.\n\n\n\n\nWhich naturally has caused some fans to accuse them of serious fraud:\n\n\n\n\nBut scandals about fake money spent on fake teams aside, there's a lot of artistry behind the meme. Check out these absolutely amazing MCAA stadiums to see who you should be rooting for this season:\n\n\n\n\nThe MCAA is hilarious if you care about both Minecraft and football, and it feels like a total inevitability. Minecraft's sandbox tools lend players all the assets they need to shape the game in whatever hilarious way they want.\n\n\nSadly, Minecraft will ditch VR at the start of 2025, but the game will likely never die as fans show no shortage of new ideas to keep bringing it to the limelight.\n\nThe post What is the MCAA?

          "description": "Those brave enough to conquer Zombies' higher rounds will likely come across a few interesting items. One, in particular, is the Loot Key, an object that varies in colors. So, if you are wondering what it does, here's everything you need to know about Loot Keys in Black Ops 6 Zombies.\n\n\nHow to use Loot Keys in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Zombies\n\n\nLoot Keys drop from various Elite zombies, including Manglers, Abominations, and Amalgams. If you're on Terminus, you can use it to open the Armory, while Liberty Falls' version unlocks the Bank Vault. The Terminus route is the simplest: all you have to do is go to the Armory at the F4 coordinates and use the key from there.\n\n\nImage by Destructoid\n\n\nThe Loot Key for the Bank Vault proves to be much more challenging, as it also requires a specific combination. You'll have to find three combinations around the map, stationed around the vault, Olly's Comics, and Liberty Lanes. If you need help finding these numbers, check out our full explainer on how to open the Bank Vault in BO6 Zombies.\n\n\nWhether you're on Liberty Falls or Terminus, you'll notice that each key shows various colors. This appearance ties into the reward's rarity type, starting from Uncommon (green) to the high-valued Legendary (gold). Legendary offers the most beneficial rewards, often giving you a weapon with a rare type of the same name. However, the Uncommon types still prove their worth by giving you some essential items, like equipment and Essence.\n\n\nTo improve your chances of unlocking the Loot Key's Legendary rewards, you must defeat more Elite zombies. Try to survive as long as possible to uncover the rarer keys. You can also save and quit if you're a solo player to keep this gear intact. Then, return to this match later to utilize this equipment again. Squad teams may also use the save and quit, as long as the Host is still active. Otherwise, you can Exfil to end the round and claim some XP.\n\nThe post What to do with Loot Keys in Black Ops 6 Zombies (BO6) appeared first on Destructoid.",

Here's how to find Armory Keys in the Black Ops 6 Zombies Terminus map.\n\n\nWhere to find Armory Keys in Black Ops 6 Zombies Terminus map\n\n\nYou can defeat Manglers and Amalgam mini-bosses to drop the Armory Key in BO6 Zombies. They tend to spawn during the higher rounds, possibly around Round 11. You can Pack-a-Punch your weapon or utilize a higher rarity type to help bring down these foes quickly. They may drop a Loot Key (the Armory Key) with a specific color if you're successful.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThe colors correspond to the rarity type of its specific rewards. So, if it's green, you'll get gifts that involve the Uncommon rarity. For the best of the best, be on the lookout for the purple or gold-colored ones, as these items offer high-valued equipment (just keep killing those Elite zombies).\n\n\nOnce you've acquired the Loot Key, go to the Armory at the F4 coordinates. You've likely encountered it when you first spawned in near the top-right corner of the map.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nUnlike the Bank Vault in Liberty Falls, you don't need a special combination to open the Armory. Once inside, a timer will commence, giving you less than a minute to loot. Zombies won't get you from here, allowing you to explore the Armory safely. In return, you can open any lockers with the key to gain rewards. Items inside will always be randomized, whether it be a weapon with high rarity or a Monkey Bomb.\n\n\nAs you progress further in the rounds, you'll discover more Armory Keys in Black Ops 6 Zombies. The Armory also serves as a reliable safe haven for the later stages. Use it wisely to temporarily escape the relentless onslaught of zombies, regroup, and prepare for the next wave. Then, you can Exfil whenever you're ready to call it quits. \n\nThe post How to get Armory Key in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Zombies Terminus (BO6) appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "There aren't many games that mix heavy-handed literature with first-person shooting. BioShock is one example that springs to mind. Not so much Half-Life 2, but someone is in the midst of creating a mod for Valve's iconic FPS that seems to take cues from the classics.\n\n\nModDB user GRÆMAMËTH is currently working on \"Goethe's Last Laugh,\" a full-conversion modification for Half-Life 2 that, from the images alone, looks wonderfully bizarre. Oh, hell. I don't think I could do it justice, so here's what the creator has to say about the project (after you've checked out the footage below, of course):\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the abstract, it’s a working class power fantasy about addiction and revolution...\n\n\nTake control of Jackson Ian Faust, a 300 year old, self destructive, misanthropic vampire, and investigate the many unusual phenomenon of Gondolas city, a fictional civilization set on the sinking monster island of Duciano.\n\n\n\n\nNo mention of a Mephistopheles-inspired gravity gun\n\n\nIt's still in development at the moment, with no release date yet. However, you can keep an eye on progress from the ModDB page linked above, or follow it on Itch.io. This one definitely seems too good to miss out on, especially with its proposed themes.\n\n\nNow, I've never read Faust, so I can't say how certain this Half-Life 2 mod will match up with the original text. But I do know that it must have inspired the project, given that it's titled after the play's author, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, and has you play as someone literally called Faust.\n\n\nIt's also where we get the term \"Faustian\" from, to refer to any kind of deal or barter that leads to dire consequences. I'm hoping there'll be some of that in GRÆMAMËTH's mod. If not, at least we get to play as a cynical vampire that's three centuries old. That's always dope. Do people say \"dope\" these days?\n\nThe post Bizarre Half-Life 2 mod lets you control a ‘300-year-old, self-destructive, misanthropic vampire’ appeared first on Destructoid.",

Všichni zúčastnění zaslouží pochvalu, protože  tento projekt velmi snadno mohl dopadnout hrozně. (Ilča 90 %)",

          "description": "Hodně mi to připomnělo \"On se bojí\" nebo filmy Charlieho Kaufmana. \"Jiný člověk\" je ale \"tlumenější\" a první půlhodinu vypadá skoro jako normální film, který možná není úplně podařeně natočený. Teprve pak to začne být opravdu divné a vyjde najevo, že to od počátku všechno byl sofistikovaný plán filmařů a že tím asi chtěli něco říct. (Ilča 70 %)",
