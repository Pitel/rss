At around the 2:30 mark, we get a shot of Arven and your Pokémon trainer looking at a rather elaborate sketch of what looks to be a Donphan, the evolution of Phanpy. Though it's looking a little different. The trailer then cuts to a close-up of what looks to be a hulking Pokémon, closely matching the sketch.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Now, nine months later, Sloclap’s martial arts brawler has arrived on the Switch with a solid port that doesn’t sacrifice anything that made the original release so great.\nYou begin the game infiltrating a rain-soaked temple, battering the students found inside, eventually joining with allies as you make your way further into the building. After you reach the top, it’s revealed you are Yang, who battles the sifu of the temple and kills him as his child watches from a cupboard. This child is subsequently killed by one of Yang’s associates. However, a medallion in the child's hand brings them back to life. Hereafter referred to as ‘Hero’, the child is the protagonist of the game, who — after turning 20 years old — seeks revenge.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It turns out the guy who owns eight physical copies (and four digital) of the original Resident Evil 4 is still pretty excited to play the remake. Who ever could have predicted this?\n\n\r\nThe day my preview went live, Capcom showed off a couple of additional bits as part of a hefty Resident Evil showcase. Alongside a fresh story trailer the company also discussed the various gubbins you’ll receive if you fork out for the game's special edition as well as a short gameplay demonstration. Surprising no one, I’ve watched these clips so many times I now have a load of thoughts that are not only completely useless but are taking up vital brain space I usually reserve for things like pin numbers and dates. If I don’t vent all of this garbage out of my skull there’s a chance I’ll forget my Mam’s birthday again, something that genuinely happened once when I was 17 and I haven’t stopped feeling guilty about it since. I bought her a plant from a Tesco Express three days later thinking that would help. It didn’t. This event haunts me more than any Resident Evil jumpscare ever could.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Baba Yaga has been forced to live in the forest having been accused of witchcraft, so it seems like one of those self-fulfilling prophecy deals.\nIt's a very brightly coloured, fantastical world, this forest you live in, and you're dropped in media res. I thought that hands-on preview I got would be quite a casual gadabout talking to a cute dragon and what have you, but in fact it was difficult, and weird, and very opaque in the best way. The res in question included treasure chests with teeth and talking pine-cone spirits, and exploding fireflies. But you're an archer, too, and I really, really hate using arrows in first-person, and I don't think that will change.\nRead more",

The person died in a hospital bed surrounded by their closest friends and family, and after they've passed on the group begins to share stories and memories from when they were alive. Death isn’t always this calm and it isn’t always this peaceful, but on rare occasions it can be. \nThis is how developers Florian Veltman and Baptiste Portefaix have approached death in How To Say Goodbye, a cosy game that explores the topic with kindness and sensitivity. With its paper doll illustrations and pastel colour palette, it kinda feels like a children's pop-up book that teaches kids about grief. It’s not overly sweet or patronising, just a gentle game about a group of ghosts who discover how to mourn, how to accept their own death, and how to move on.\nRead more",

Szymanski says Chop Goblins’ campaign can be finished within a single sitting of around 30 minutes. Appropriately enough, it’s all about time travel.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I've now played both Square Enix strategy RPGs for around six hours apiece now - starting with Tactics Ogre for my preview the other week, and following it up with a Triangle-shaped chaser. I didn't have any history with either game before now, but it's become increasingly apparent that they're effectively cut from the same tile-based cloth. And I mean, exactly the same. They're so similar, in fact, that it's kinda hilarious Square are releasing them so close together on PC, with Tactics Ogre's release on November 11th following little more than a month after Triangle Strategy. \nAt the same time, though, their approach to story-telling couldn't be more different, and comparing and contrasting them like this one after the other has been both fun and enlightening. Triangle Strategy, for example, is about 80% cutscene, 20% fighting for its first six hours, while Tactics Ogre is pretty much the opposite. And yet… I think I sort of prefer Triangle Strategy?

          "description": "When Team Ninja's Soulslike action-RPG Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty was announced not long ago, I thought: \"Wow, that looks like my sort of jam\". A PS5 demo came out and I only got to spend all of five minutes with it before life got in the way. I never got to truly taste the jam, which was quite sad. So, colour me very excited when I got to spend a good couple of hours battling through two short hands-on demos. I got battered by a big pig, prickled to death by a massive porcupine, and aggressively mauled by a large tiger. And I'd say I had a whale of a time. There was no killer whale in the demo, but I wouldn't count it out for the full release.\nRead more",

These are both high-end GPUs, set to cost $899 and $999 respectively when they release on December 13th, but you’ll note those prices are oodles cheaper than the £1269 / $1199 RTX 4080 and the £1679 / $1599 RTX 4090.\nThey’re also structurally distinct from the current Radeon RX 6000 cards to an extent that, frankly, is quite surprising to see from AMD GPUs. RDNA 3 uses a Ryzen CPU-inspired chiplet design, where the GPU is split up into different sections, and the new media engine is engineered for the 4K gaming monitors of the future as much as it is for current PC hardware. \nRead more",

The thing is, if anything I don't think it's weird enough. If you're going to do a game where the main character uses flaming witchhazel sticks to lash energy-crystal monsters with vagina-flower faces, my view is that you go hard or go home.\nRead more",

          "description": "Ghost Song is a 2D Metroid-like that's always a feast for the eyes, but a frequent frustration for your head and hands. Its gorgeous art direction depicts a vibrant alien world that bubbles and throbs with bio-mechanical life, where spore clouds and fleshy organic tunnels live side by side with floating metal skulls and impenetrable thickets of wires and cables. It's a fascinating place that seems to morph and change with every passing map segment, calling to mind the animated techno gunge of Akira and Metropolis one minute, and the flowering brilliance of Alex Garland's Annihilation the next. Its roots sink deep, creating a world you'll want to explore every last nook and cranny of as you delve deeper into its underbelly to find out why you're here.\nBut Deadsuit, your android-like protagonist, makes for a slightly rusty-feeling companion at times, lacking the grace and elegance of Nintendo's Samus Aran, and the nimble dexterity of Team Cherry's nameless knight. It will tide you over until Silksong arrives, for sure, but it also never quite sings in the way you'd hope.\nRead more",

          "description": "As Replika Elster, Signalis will force you to untangle a mess of writhing flesh and malfunctioning memories to separate dream from lived experience. So, in keeping with dream logic: You’ve played Signalis before, and you’ve never played anything like it. It lovingly adopts the trappings of PS1-era survival horror, and more importantly, it fully understands why those systems, aesthetics, tropes, and technical limits are so engaging. But it also presents and explores love and loss, freedom and manipulation, fear and trauma, in its own cruelly captivating way. It’s strange and familiar, gorgeous and horrible. It’s an absolute banger of a videogame, made all the more impressive by its indiest of indies price tag and two-person dev team.\nFundamentally, it's a love story. Things go bad for space technician Elster, but she made a promise she intends to keep. We’ll get back to this later. First up: Signalis excels at capturing the essence of survival horror - those juxtaposed feelings of possibility and unease that hit you entering a long hallway, flanked by doors, only to find all but two locked or malfunctioning. You’ll be back here soon enough, you know that. Probably with a new key. Maybe with a new gun. But there’s also a good chance things will have…changed, by then. A floor tile might reveal new horrors. You might have spent your last bullet. So, left or right? Or maybe back? You can only carry six items, after all.\nRead more",

In fact, it's overall pretty good, but too much of Bannerlord's design is exactly the same as it was in Warband, and the bulk of what's been added is extraneous strategy guff that doesn't meaningfully improve it at all.\nIn between leading your warband around its 2D map and stabbing dudes alongside your men in 3D battles, you can now make weapons by commandeering local workshops (I guess?) to break down and recombine spare swords. You can only do a few per day, so the pattern is to repeatedly click \"make charcoal\", then leave to rest your tired little arms and repeat. I could probably get a more ~optimal build~ by smithing a megasword, but the one I have already does what I need. You can’t equip your army, even though that was in the very ropey Freeman. The end result is another axe in a game where you'll discard hundreds of them. You can't do armour, a huge waste considering the variety available, and that you spend vastly more time seeing your outfits than looking at anyone's pommel.\nRead more",

          "description": "The AMD Ryzen 7 5800X is a good gaming CPU with better content creation performance than the more expensive 5800X3D - even though it's slower than the X3D in gaming. Still, at its price point it hits a punch, and the boffins at HUKD have spotted a good deal for the 5800X at CCL. There, you can find the 5800X for £235 when you use code AFF15 with some nifty extras: a 64GB Micro SD card and a code for Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves. \nThe way it works is pretty simple - you need to get your total basket over £250 for the AFF15 code to work. So, pick anything on the store that's more than £5.51, like this Micro SD card, add it to your basket alongside the 5800X, then use the AFF15 code to bring the price down to the £235 we quoted. The game code will come with your order, no opt-in necessary, from what we understand. \nRead more",

The trick involves trading gold farmed in WOW for tokens that convert to Battle.net balance, which can then be spent on Overwatch 2 cosmetics.

Pokud se chcete také dozvědět jak na to, dorazte na Virtuální Bastlírnu – virtuální setkání (nejen) ajťáků, bastlířů, elektroniků, fyziků.\r\n\r\nBastlíři z křemíkového kopce pro vás ještě našli jak používat SMD rezistory velikost 2512 místo tenzometrů, že KiCAD ve verzi 7.0 bude podporovat knihovny v externích SQL databázích a že na poslední verzi macOS Ventura dojde k rozbití podpory RP2040. A mnoho dalšího.\r\n\r\nAť už vás zaujalo cokoliv z nabízených témat, chcete ukázat nějaký svůj bastl a nebo si jen potřebujete postěžovat na nedostatek volného času, dorazte. Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat v pondělí 7. listopadu od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.",

AMD will likely have their Radeon Software for Linux driver package on their website but that is limited in scope to their few supported enterprise/LTS Linux distributions supported, while most gamers/enthusiasts will be left wondering about the Linux kernel and Mesa versioning requirements...",

Taking time out from her own vigilante squad, \"The Flock\", Provie will be ably helping the River City Girls in their fist-flinging battle against the powerful Sabu crime family.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9rJZMWam-A\nRiver City Girls 2 was first revealed way back in the summer of 2021, with the team at WayForward drip-feeding characters, features, and rad new 'choons since the title's initial reveal. While we are still yet to receive a western release date for the sequel's launch, (it's getting a little tight on that \"2022\" release date now). The sequel, though similar in design to the 2020 original, will feature several new features including simultaneous four-player co-op action, and a variety of stylishly designed new boss characters.\nRiver City Girls 2 is in development for PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms. Be sure to check out our previous write-ups on both River City Girls and River City Girls Zero, as well as our interviews with director Adam Tierney, and awesome composer Megan McDuffee.\nThe post Provie set for her block-beating comeback in River City Girls 2 appeared first on Destructoid.",

The previous record to hit the Big Billion was held by the excellent 2012 entry Call of Duty: Black Ops 2, which hit the 10-digit mark in 15 days.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeVapCrI1pY\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare II continues the reboot/reboot storyline that began with 2019's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. The plot details a violent, globe-trotting campaign that sees Task Force 141, once again headed up by Captain Price, attempt to dismantle a dangerous arms cartel that threatens to bring death and destruction to the United States. In curious fashion, the game works as both a brand new title and a prequel to the previous Modern Warfare releases from the mid-'00s.\nFollowing on from the relatively blah welcoming received by 2021's Call of Duty Vanguard. Activision will no doubt be breathing a sigh of relief that, for now at any rate, the Call of Duty franchise remains untarnished from both a popularity and financial standpoint, with MWII's success likely pointing to further years of entries in one of the industry's most lucrative franchises.\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is available now on PlayStation, PC (Steam/Battle.net), and Xbox.\nThe post Modern Warfare II has hit $1 billion in revenue in just 10 days appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Nearing the end of 2022, Nintendo solidifies a few releases\nJust recently, Nintendo finally dropped a Direct and dumped a ton of new info, remakes, and Nintendo 2023 first party release dates into our lap. Now, a new financial report for the fiscal year ending in March 2023 is backing up what we found out in September: with hopefully no delays in sight.\nSo there's a few things to note here. Pikmin 4 is still just \"2023\" without a window in mind: which seems perfect for an E3 release date announcement for Q3 or Q4. Metroid Prime 4 (which is still a working title, or notated as \"temp\" in the financial report) is in the works and doesn't even have a year in mind. Plus, Advance Wars 1+2 Re-Boot Camp is \"TBA\" as of November 2022.\nAs far as other regions go, Europe seems to be on the same timeline as the US. Japan is welcoming Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope (which most of the world already has) on December 2, and the Re-Boot Camp \"TBA\" listing is completely missing. No doubt we'll get more info and maybe even another Direct as we head into early 2023.\nNintendo's 2023 first party Switch release dates:\nFire Emblem Engage - 1/20/2023\nKirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe - 2/24/2023\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - 5/12/2023\nPikmin 4 - 2023\nMetroid Prime 4 - TBA\nAdvance Wars 1+2 Re-Boot Camp - TBA\nThe post Nintendo commits to 2023 first party release dates in new financial results appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Pump the Brakes\nElectronic Arts, in an internal statement acquired by GamesIndustry.biz, has announced that it is ending the Project CARS racing franchise, effective immediately. This makes the final release in the simulation series the mobile title Project CARS GO, which launched on iOS and Android in 2021.\n\"Today we announced internally an update to our racing portfolio. Following an evaluation of the next Project CARS title and its longer-term growth potential, we have made the decision to stop further development and investment for the franchise,\" reads the statement. \"Decisions like these are very hard, but allow us to prioritise our focus in areas where we believe we have the strongest opportunity to create experiences that fans will love.\"\n\"We are working with everyone impacted by this decision to place them into suitable roles across our EA Sports and racing portfolio, as well as other parts of EA, wherever we can. Our priority now is on providing as much support as possible to our people through this transition.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BPzkjvV_Rk\nThe Project CARS IP became the property of EA following the purchase of Codemasters and its subsidiaries, (including CARS developer Slightly Mad Studios), in December 2020. At the time of purchase, Slightly Mad had somewhere in the region of 150 employees, and so here's to hoping that EA will ensure new roles for the studio's staff throughout its myriad other development and publishing wings.\nThere have been four Project CARS games in total, including Project CARS GO. Though the first two games received critical and fan acclaim, Project CARS 3 was less warmly received. Earlier this year, it was announced that the first two titles were to be delisted from sale due to the expiration of in-game licenses, and it would seem that EA has decided that this particular racer has run its course.\nThe post EA is officially ending the Project CARS franchise appeared first on Destructoid.",

They usually air at 9AM ET, and show off a variety of in-game shenanigans: both on the small and large ends of the content spectrum. Today is one of the former days.\nSimply put, here is the hype message we got yesterday from the game's official Twitter account: \"Calling all Trainers! A new #PokemonScarletViolet trailer arrives tomorrow! Tune in to our YouTube channel at 6:00 a.m. PT on 11/8 for the latest news! Don’t forget to subscribe and turn on notifications—you won’t want to miss this.\" And the thing you want want to miss? An Ed Sheeran AMV (anime music video) with Scarlet and Violet footage. That's literally it.\nSet to the tune of the Ed Sheeran song \"Celestial\" (which debuted at the end of September), the new video embedded below is basically just a standard trailer, complete with things we've seen before. Exploration, the three core storylines, the legendary mount Pokemon, and terastallizing (the new change mechanic) are all on display.\nWe're clearly in the home stretch here!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWFiD5-hhFU\nThe post The new Pokemon trailer is basically an Ed Sheeran AMV appeared first on Destructoid.",

Now developers, Bungie included, are stepping in to make sure that PlayStation players specifically are playing the right version of Destiny 2.\nOver on their weekly blog, Bungie provided the following statement for PS5 owners:\n\"Heads up, PlayStation Guardians. We’ve noticed a notable number of PS5 players playing the PS4 version of Destiny 2 on their current-generation consoles. For the optimal experience for PlayStation goodness, make sure to check out this resource here to upgrade to the free PS5 version to see an improvement in framerates and graphics overall.\"\n\nThat resource actually goes straight to a Sony FAQ page, which explains the difference between selecting the \"PS4 version\" and \"PS5 version\" of games that ostensibly have cross-generational delivery. If you haven't done it before, it involves going to the game hub for an individual title, then checking to see if you have the upgrade license available, then downloading that version entirely.\nIt's a shame that this is where we're at nearly two years after the launch of the PS5 (the anniversary is happening this week!), but it is what it is.

According to the publisher Stranger Things VR will launch in the winter of 2023 for all \"major VR platforms\".\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQnFM5X5XQM\nPerhaps surprisingly, players will actually take up the role of Vecna — the antagonist of the show's fourth season — as they attempt to wreak havoc and vengeance on both the town of Hawkins and, in particular, its powerful psychic savior, Eleven. Stranger Things VR will see Vecna, (and by proxy, the player) invade multiple worlds, conjure up terrifying and vivid nightmares, and engage in reality-shattering psychological warfare.\nIn many ways, Stranger Things is custom designed for virtual reality, given its \"no rules\" approach to the simple act of physical existence. While VR, for many, remains little more than a somewhat interactable rollercoaster ride/ghost train, it is a medium that perfectly suits franchises that focus on the strange, the bizarre, and the warped. And, as such, fans of The Upside Down and its occupants would likely have a real thrill ride exploring its mind-bending themes and aesthetic in fully immersive 3D action.\nStranger Things VR will launch winter 2023 on all major VR platforms,\nThe post Stranger Things VR announced for all ‘major VR platforms’ appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It's running through November 9\nA new My Nintendo Rabbids promotion is afoot, and it's currently live now through November 9, 2022 at 2AM ET.\nAs a bid to promote Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope (which is out later this month), it'll involve several figurines/plush toys, as well as more traditional collector's edition swag like lithographs and an art book. It'll work just like prior My Nintendo contests, where folks can spend 10 Platinum Points for an entry, up to three entries.\nAs a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked.\nHere is what the My Nintendo Rabbids prize lot entails:\nRabbid Mario Figurine\nRabbid Peach Figurine\nSet of 3 lithographs\nSpark Plush\nArtbook\nSpark Phone Ring Holder\nStickers Sheet\n[Update: Here's a reminder that the contest ends on November 9 at 2AM ET. Effectively, unless you're a night owl, you have until tomorrow evening in most regions to put your Platinum Points up.]\nThe post This My Nintendo Rabbids Sparks of Hope prize pack is pretty cute appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "And what will be left of them?\nSupermassive Games is gearing up for the launch of The Devil in Me, the fourth and final episode in the first season of its scary, (and highly enjoyable) anthology series, The Dark Pictures. Publisher Bandai Namco released a new trailer, focusing on the hapless folk treading, foolhardily, into The Curator's world.\nThe Dark Pictures: The Devil in Me will tell a tale of a party of documentary makers who find themselves invited to a modern replica of the \"The Murder Castle\" — the opulent estate of America's first publicized serial killer H. H. Holmes. Seeing this as the opportunity to make the ultimate true crime document, our young protagonists jump at the opportunity, unaware of the horrifying, twisted plans that lay in store...\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUcFLkAZmyo\nThe trailer introduces heroes Charlie, Kate, Mark, Jamie, and Erin, with quick glimpses offered of a mysterious, cloaked killer and, of course, The Curator himself. Of all The Dark Pictures titles to date, The Devil in Me looks set to be the most \"slasher\" based, perhaps eschewing the supernatural and/or monster-based terror of its predecessors. Horror fans will also spot numerous familiar themes and references, from a Shining-esque bar and a Tourist Trap range of animatronics, to Saw-style \"death traps\" and the Giallo overtones of the villain themselves.\nThe Devil in Me will represent the culmination of The Dark Pictures' first season, which has bombarded us with a frenzied party of pain and jump-scares over the past four years. Still, with a whole host of previously trademarked titles, and sales still riding relatively high, we can be sure that there are many more thrills and spills currently in the works within the gleefully grotesque minds of Supermassive Games.\nThe Dark Pictures: The Devil in Me launches November 18 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.\nThe post Who will survive in The Dark Pictures: The Devil in Me? appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's called \"Gimmighoul,\" and follows a long line of mythological tricksters that are focused around coins/gold/wealth.  Gimmighoul takes on a \"chest form\" in Scarlet and Violet, and functions a lot like a Mimic treasure chest in many other forms of fantasy media. But it also sports a \"roaming form,\" which is live in Pokemon Go now.\nHere's a breakdown:\n\"Research conducted by Professor Willow and Jacq, a biology teacher from the Paldea region, confirms that Trainers have spotted Gimmighoul in its Roaming Form. Further, there’s another form in the Paldea region called Chest Form Gimmighoul.\"\n\nWe also get a reconfirmation that Pokemon Home support is still planned for Scarlet and Violet after launch. Right at 5:01 in the below video at the bottom of the screen, you'll see that Scarlet/Violet connectivity \"is expected to be added to Pokemon Home after the game's release.\" Future announcements will come at a later date.\nWhile Pokemon connectivity is often rolled out haphazardly or late, it's nice to know that it's coming at some point.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nzi0S3NGzg\nThe post Pokemon Go and Scarlet/Violet connectivity confirmed for 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

In the most recent episode of the show, it was suggested that Blizzard could be planning on launching the sequel as soon as April of next year, with pre-orders opening in December, perhaps following a brand new trailer at the upcoming Game Awards show, which is currently scheduled to take place exactly one month from now. Pre-orders are expected to include standard editions alongside Blizzard's typical premium collector's set.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdDpqCmjb4\nOf course, this is mostly hearsay (or should that be \"heresy\"?) for now, but the XboxEra podcast has been pretty much on the money when it comes to the revelation of upcoming projects and release dates. We already know that Diablo IV is in a very playable form, as private betas have been circling among staff and colleagues for some time now (complete with oodles of leaked footage). Sping 2023 still seems a little early, but if Overwatch 2 has taught us anything, Blizzard is not the \"ready when it's ready\" company it once was, and is seemingly far more interested in getting products out in customers' hands ASAP.\nDiablo IV is currently in development for PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.\nReport: Diablo 4 could launch April 2023, preorders going live December [Windows Central]\nThe post Diablo IV rumored to be opening its dank dungeons April 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Must be talking to an angel...\nThe retro gaming aficionados over at Hamster are continuing on their current trend of pulling out bafflingly bizarre and outrageously obscure arcade titles for your approval — And this week's entry is no different, with the arrival of Nichibutsu's unique, star-gazing... shmup? Mischievous Angel.\nReleased to arcades in 1984, (as Itazura Tenshi), this surprisingly novel little release sees the player don the wings of a starbound angel, who is tasked with recreating the constellations in order to impress his pretty angel pal. Using non-linear, eight-way directional gameplay, our heroes travel through a gridded starscape, lining up stars in a \"dot-to-dot\" fashion in order to complete various famous star signs and constellations, such as The Big Dipper... umm... Jerry The Cowboy... and... Alan... The Cowboy.\nCheck out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber Old Classic Retro Gaming.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M9ut_Ovm3w\nAs the not-so-mischievous angel lights up the sky, they must also avoid attack from sensible villains such as alien invaders, witches, and flying jesters. Fear not, as grabbing a bow and arrow will offer up temporary firepower to fend off these ne'er-do-wells. Because he's also Cupid?.. or Kid Icarus?.. or something. Following several cosmos of action, our young lovers must be reunited in a recurring bonus stage so wholesome and melancholy that is has to be seen to be believed.\nMischievous Angel is, despite its admittedly dated mechanics, a pretty unique and cute take on the shmup genre, with a delightful concept and some sweet visual design ideas. While hardly a smash hit of the arcade circuit, it is undeniably an original idea, and it is nice to see this quirky release curated in the Arcade Archives range.\nMischievous Angel is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.\nThe post Obscure shmup Mischievous Angel joins the Arcade Archives appeared first on Destructoid.",

But it is interest in a franchise that's already seen some adaptation, and could see more.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7XM597XO94\nI'm thinkin' I'm back\nJohn Wick has already had his own game, in the form of Bithell Games' John Wick Hex. The studio imagined Wick's action-heavy shootouts in turn-based strategy puzzles, in a way that reminded me a bit of Invisible, Inc.\nIt sounds like John Wick Hex turned out alright, too. But the CEO's choice of words, in \"big\" and \"AAA,\" bring to mind a hefty investment.\nConsidering the only other John Wick adaptation we have in the virtual space aside from Hex is a Fortnite cameo, there's still room. A studio like Sloclap could absolutely tackle something fast-paced and action-heavy in the Wick universe. Though my personal choice would be to give this the Alpha Protocol treatment. Either way, I'm all for more digital Keanu.\nThe post Lionsgate is interested in a ‘big AAA’ John Wick game appeared first on Destructoid.",

I mean, I still mostly stick to the roster of original heroes because I like the simplicity of their kits, but even if I don't plan on playing any of the new additions, their presence still switches up the meta significantly. Now rumors are flying as to who the newest recruit to the Overwatch lineup is going to be, and the frontrunner as of now is Mauga, a Talon Heavy Assault and former friend of Baptiste.\nMauga appeared in a short story called \"What You Left Behind,\" which focused on Baptiste's backstory and was released alongside the Baptiste Reunion Challenge mini-event.

          "description": "Don't worry about the differences too much, though\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge is getting a new version this month. The latest TMNT title is getting a native PS5 version on November 15.\nWhat's different? Aside from running natively on the PlayStation 5, not much. Tribute Games and DotEmu have made it clear this version is identical to the PlayStation 4 version of TMNT: Shredder's Revenge. Previously, TMNT would run on backward compatibility for the PS5, using the PS4 version.\nThis does mean that PS4 users aren't getting a free upgrade to the new version. But again, this is apparently not a substantively different option. So the reason why DotEmu and Tribute are making this? Well, it looks like for a possible physical version.\n\"The PS5 version is necessary to eventually offer physical PS5 copies ;),\" the Tribute Games account noted.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozKsDzumb0c\nSo if you've got one PlayStation copy, you still seem set. And down the line, this might allow for a PS5 physical version of the turtle-based beat 'em up.\nA new platform for TMNT\nShredder's Revenge was released earlier this year, and brought a whole lot of Saturday morning cartoon action to PC and consoles. The TMNT beat 'em up did pretty alright in sales too, so it's not too surprising to see these studios considering future options with the native PS5 edition.\nWhether we see more content arrive in TMNT: Shredder's Revenge in the future or not seems up in the air. I'd love to see the crew dip deeper into TMNT nostalgia, but considering DotEmu especially has a good track record for beat 'em ups, I'm eager to see whatever's in store next.\nThe post TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge is getting a native PS5 version this month appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Standing here, I realize that this Super Replay will be a cut above the rest because we’ll be slicing and dicing in Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance! Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. You can also catch up on previous episodes by visiting our new Game Informer Shows YouTube channel or watching the latest episode embedded below. \nMetal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. \n\n\nJoin me, Marcus Stewart, and Blake Hester as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure. If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

The studio has been quite open with its accessibility desires, detailing more than 60 in a blog post earlier this year. Now, with the game out on November 9, the studio has released an even more detailed post breaking down exactly what to expect. \n\n\nSanta Monica Studio says there are more than 70 features in Ragnarok that \"enable players to customize the gameplay experience to suit their needs\" and the list is a sight to behold. It includes plenty of presets, too, which could make it easier for players to easily get the game started in a way that makes the experience better for them. Presets include one for vision accessibility, hearing accessibility, motion reduction, apply motor accessibility, and a changed setting indicator as well. \nThere are alternative control schemes, remappable buttons, hold and press options, in-game assistance settings, and so much more. If you're interested in what accessibility features are in Ragnarok, be sure to check out the full blog post. \nFor more, read Game Informer's God of War Ragnarok review and then check out all of the performance and quality modes for the game. \nWhich accessibility features do you find most helpful in games?

As for why, she says the working dynamic with the game's audio director has become difficult and she sees no path forward. Variety reports that the audio director in question is Stephen Miller but Schachner doesn't name this person in her announcement. \nNews of her departure comes from a statement released by Schachner on Twitter on November 3, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. Schachner's departure comes after years of work with Modern Warfare II studio Infinity Ward on games like 2019's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and 2016's Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare. Other credits include Assassin's Creed Valhalla and Anthem, as noted by VGC. \n\"I am sad to say I can no longer continue to compose music for MWII/Warzone,\" her statement reads. \"Over the past couple of months, the working dynamic with the audio director has become increasingly challenging and I don't see any path forward. As of now, I am unsure of the status and release plan for the soundtrack as it's been taken out of my hands. While I don't have any control over how the music is presented in-game, what will be released on the soundtrack is not my artistic intent in regards to mixing and mastering.\" \nShe then thanks fans for their support and gives some shout outs to others involved with the game's score, including mixer Frank Wolf, \"creative vision\" Mike Dean, and performing artists including Baseck, Brain Mantia, and M.B. Gordy.\nYou can read her full statement below: \nMany of you have been asking about the MWII soundtrack release.\npic.twitter.com/UEqgpCTjUg\nNovember 3, 2022\nFor more, read Game Informer's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II review. \n[Source: Video Games Chronicle]\nWhat are your thoughts on the score of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II?

          "description": "Ubisoft has rolled out its post-launch content roadmap for Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope. Owners of the game’s season pass, whether purchased separately for $29.99 or bundled in the game’s $89.99 Gold Edition, have three big adventures aimed at keeping them glued to the game throughout 2023. \nIt all kicks off early next year with the first expansion, Tower of Doooom (their spelling, not mine). This introduces a new combat mode where the team must fight their way up Madame Bwahstrella’s multi-story tower to rescue Spawny, the visor-rocking Rabbid from Kingdom Battle. What’s important to note is that Tower of Doooom will be exclusive to the season pass, meaning you’ll be unable to purchase it separately. \nThe second untitled DLC arrives in mid-2023. So far, we only know it takes players to a new planet, features never-before-seen enemies, allies, and secrets, and stars a new antagonist. Finally, Rayman crashes the party in the final expansion to close out the year. Ubisoft’s limbless hero joins Rabbid Peach and Rabbid Mario on a separate adventure in a new location. Unlike Tower of Doooom, the second and third expansions can be purchased a la carte. \nI enjoyed Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope quite a bit, awarding it a 9 out of 10. In my review, which you can read here, I wrote that the game “builds upon Kingdom Battle’s foundation with smart tweaks and fun additions to emerge as a better game in every way.”",

Find out why it's one of our most anticipated horror games after that, and then watch this action-packed combat trailer from earlier this summer. \nFor additional information about Atomic Heart, be sure to check out Mundfish's official website, where there's info about the game's different editions available for preorder and more. \nAre you excited about Atomic Heart?

          "description": "According to a Bloomberg report, video game publisher Embracer has shut down Onoma, the studio formerly known as Square Enix Montreal, just months after its acquisition. Some staff will be transferred to Eidos Montreal, another studio owned by Embracer. This news comes just a few weeks after Onoma underwent a rebranding process where it adopted the new name.\nOnoma was best known for its work on the Go series, turn-based spin-offs of popular Eidos Interactive titles designed for mobile. This includes Hitman Go, Lara Croft Go, and Deus Ex Go. Their most recent work was Tomb Raider Reloaded, which came to mobile devices earlier this year, and their future plans involved a title based on Avatar: The Last Airbender.\nEarlier this year, Onoma was just one part of a much larger series of Embracer’s acquisitions, which included Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montreal. In August, Embracer proceeded to acquire Limited Run Games, Tripwire Interactive, Tuxedo Labs, the IP rights to The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, and several more studios.\nThe Bloomberg report also says that the closure is part of a cost-cutting initiative, and that Eidos Montreal will have projects scaled back and cut as well. Some of these resources will be redirected to assist in the development of a game in the Fable franchise, led by Playground Games.\n[Source: Bloomberg]\nWere you a fan of the Go series? Do you think acquisitions are good for the games industry? Let us know in the comments.",

          "description": "The official Sonic the Hedgehog YouTube channel has uploaded an animated short titled “Sonic Frontiers Prologue: Divergence.” Starring Knuckles, the short reveals how he wound up on the island players explore in Sonic Frontiers. You can watch the six-minute animation in its entirety below.\n\n\nIn the trailer, Knuckles provides a voice-over explanation of his background up until now, including the fact that he was tasked with guarding the Master Emerald, a relic that hasn’t appeared in the Sonic series for quite some time. The trailer ends with Knuckles absolutely demolishing some robots, and while we’ve received no indication that he will be playable in Sonic Frontiers, that sequence makes me hope he will be.\nKnuckles has been a core Sonic character for most of the franchise’s existence, so it’s not surprising that he’s making an appearance in the blue blur’s latest adventure. While this animated prologue gives us insight into how he wound up on the island, it’s still not entirely clear why, especially when it comes to the appearance of Sage (a new character introduced in Sonic Frontiers) at the end of the trailer. We’ll have to wait for the full game to find out.\nThe past month has been full of Sonic news. We got a December 14 release date for Sonic Prime, Sonic Frontiers got a trailer confirming Super Sonic would be playable in the game, and we learned that the Sonic series has sold over 1.5 billion copies worldwide. For more Sonic news, check out our cover story from earlier this year, and stay tuned for more Sonic Frontiers coverage when the game releases on November 8.",

The news was announced through a blog post on the Spry Fox website, which also answers some questions about the future of the studio.\nSpry Fox says the partnership will not change any of their upcoming plans, meaning that Cozy Grove 2 and their unnamed non-violent MMO will still be developed as planned. Instead, Netflix will provide them with financial support, which Spry Fox says will allow them to “stop stressing” about how their games will generate profit. Despite all of Netflix’s current games existing through their mobile app, the blog post does not mention anything about platform exclusivity.\nSpry Fox joins five other in-house game developers at Netflix: Next Games (Stranger Things: Puzzle Tales), Night School Studio (Oxenfree), Boss Fight Entertainment (Dungeon Boss), and two internal studios in Helsinki, Finland and southern California.\nNetflix launched its games collection just over a year ago, in November of 2021. Currently, subscribers can play over 30 games on their mobile app, including Into the Breach, Spiritfarer, and Poinpy. On top of that, Netflix has over 50 more games in development.

That was a vaguely defined arrangement at the time, but we now know the partnership will produce a minimum of three titles.\nEA announced the news in a press release, with the publisher describing it as a “long-term” deal that could extend beyond three games based on the wording. The release also specifies these titles will be action-adventure games for consoles and PC, each featuring original stories in the Marvel universe. \nIt's worth clarifying that EA is not getting exclusive rights to Marvel like it had with Star Wars. There are multiple Marvel games in the works at various studios, including the recently announced Captain America/Black Panther game from Amy Hennig’s Skydance New Media. \n“We have been long-time fans of Marvel and their impressive leadership, so this is a remarkable moment for our developers as well as our players and fans,” said EA COO Laura Miele. “We look forward to welcoming Marvel into the EA family of creators and know this collaboration will produce exceptional experiences for our players. We can’t wait to see players' reactions when they suit up as Iron Man and do the extraordinary things this Super Hero is known for.”\nWe’re curious to learn what other Marvel projects are on the docket and which EA studios are behind them. Motive’s Iron Man, a single-player third-person action game, is currently in pre-production, so it’s a long way from release (the team is also making the Dead Space remake).

          "description": "Remember Mewgenics? The wacky cat-breeding roguelike is the brainchild of Super Meat Boy co-creator and The Binding of Isaac mastermind Edmund McMillen and has been in and out of the works for a decade. After being announced, put on hold, and restarted, it appears to have a new release window. \nMcMillen tweeted a gif of two of the game’s adorable cats engaging in what we'll call an intimate cat exercise. The tweet links to the game’s Steam page, which lists a 2024 release window.\nHold on to your Butts!https://t.co/wDBOizNXGl pic.twitter.com/MESXJFFXsh\nOctober 28, 2022\nWhat the heck is Mewgenics? The game tasks players with collecting and breeding hundreds of cats to train and send into battle. Or, as the Steam description puts it, Mewgenics is a “turn-based legacy roguelike draft sim about cats!” The game apparently boasts “100s of hours” of gameplay, multiple classes with over 50 unique abilities, over 200 enemies, and other features. \nMewgenics was first announced in 2012, with McMillen at the time describing it as \"By far the strangest project I've ever worked on.” McMillen has worked on it alongside Tyler Glaiel; the pair previously partnered for The End is Nigh, among other titles. The game was originally billed as a cross between Pokémon, The Sims, and Animal Crossing, and had first been planned to release in 2014. It was, of course, delayed, and its development was put on indefinite hold in 2016 when McMillen began work on The Legend of Bum-Bo, which launched in 2019. At the time, McMillen was unsure of Mewgenics’ future, but in 2018 he announced he was remaking the game to be released in “a few years.” \nThe game is slated to launch for PC, though whether or not it’s still coming to iOS is unknown. Are you still interested in Mewgenics? Let us know in the comments! For more on Edmund McMillen, we spoke with him last December where he discussed his life and career, including Mewgenics, which you can read in this interview feature.",

Silver Tempest stars Alolan Vulpix on the key art, but monsters like Lugia, Serperior, Ho-Oh, and Mawile share the spotlight. Meanwhile, players can expect cards starring Regieleki and Regidrago.\nThe Pokémon Company sent us several booster packs so we could open them and see what we pull. While it may just be dumb luck, I feel like this expansion gave me better pulls than any others in recent memory. As I cracked these open, I was met with several attractive full-art cards, as well as some gorgeous Trainer Gallery cards. I even managed to pull two of the three new Radiant Pokémon cards. \nThis expansion adds over 190 cards to the ever-growing library of Pokémon cards. That number includes 6 Pokémon VSTAR cards, 15 Pokémon V cards, 1 Pokémon VMAX card, 30 special art Trainer Gallery cards, and more than 15 Trainer cards. You can see my favorite pulls from this expansion below.\n\nPokémon Trading Card Game: Sword and Shield – Silver Tempest launches on November 11. For all things Pokémon Trading Card Game, head to our special hub by clicking on the banner below!",
