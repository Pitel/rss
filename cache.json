          "description": "Entry to Valhalla secured.\nSince the release of Volgar the Viking in 2013, fans have been itching for a full sequel to the Rastan-inspired action platformer for over a decade at this point. Now the time has finally arrived. Thanks to a partnership between developer Crazy Viking Studios and retro specialist Digital Eclipse, we can step back into the boots of Volgarr as he embarks on a quest that will prove more deadly than any he’s faced. The result is a game that, frankly, feels improved in just about every conceivable way, making Volgarr the Viking II not only one of the best 2D action platformers on Switch, but one of the best of all time.\nLet’s start with the obvious: Volgarr II is brutal. There have been several adjustments made to make the game more approachable to newcomers, which we’ll get into in more detail later, but you should know that this isn’t for the faint of heart. You will die in Volgarr II, and you will die a lot. Like the original, getting through each stage is an exercise in learning the layout, anticipating every enemy position, and observing their attack patterns and weaknesses.

          "description": "One of the neat things about Norland's fantasy medievalism is that specialist knowledge is tied to characters. So if there's only one person in your village who knows how to brew tastier beer, and they die after being freakishly savaged by a passing wolf (it happens), suddenly your village will have no artisanal lager master. The results may be devastating. Luckily, you can share knowledge in a number of ways - by copying books, or having \"wise conversations\". The exception to this is child characters, whose pea-sized brains can't learn specialist knowledge, only soaking up basic attributes like \"manners\" from the teachers you assign to them. Well, until now. The developers for the Rimworld-meets-Crusader Kings catastrophe simulator have made kids a little smarter. They'll now learn more important things from their adult teachers.\nRead more",

Specifically, laidback intercity services with nobody else in the quiet car and certainly, none of those screeching smaller bipeds, or \"children\" as they are scientifically known.

As such I spend most train journeys these days lurking between carriages, trolling the door sensors and scowling furiously at anybody who visits the loo.

Since releasing in 2022, Torn Banner have lavished the player base with free horses, angry peasants, and most recently, the Regicide update - hosting a climatic tete-a-tete between two angry crownmen. With work on No More Room In Hell 2 well underway though, Torn Banner have decided to call it on Chiv 2, which they now consider “feature complete.”\n \nRead more",

It's possible, however, that Overwatch 2 will swing back in the other direction, as Blizzard are now \"exploring how we can test different forms of 6v6 in the game to gauge the results\", with a view to restoring some of the joyful chaos that saw entire teams of Reinhardts charging the objective in formation.\n Read more",

Sorry, America! Anyway, let's have a looksie at the PC game release sheets.\nRead more",

          "description": "One of the most memorable moments of Metro Exodus comes from a standoff with a giant catfish, who you have to avoid for a while (along with the cultists who worship it) before going \"fishing\" using an entire human corpse as bait. I didn't expect to see any rival catfish appearing in games after that, but now that I think about it - why not? They're a naturally freaky animal, perfect video game antagonists. And the developers of upcoming Japanese folklore 'em up Otoshi No Shima seem to understand this, having created a monstrous creature with a gaping mouth that follows the player at every turn. Come see.\nRead more",

          "description": "Readers, something actually magical has happened! I’ve spent a non-zero amount of time this week compiling a wishlist for potential Stardew Valley-likes that also let me keep pets. I wasn’t sure what I wanted to play, but I knew I was burnt out on both stabbing and shooting, and wanted something light and colourful with a solid loop that I could veg out (pun intended) with at the end of the day. I even went to so far as to create a chap named Karrot King in Stardew before quitting in disgust because I couldn’t easily access carrot seeds.\nI cannot in good conscious claim that I manifested such a videogame - that was the work of Skyreach Studio. However, this is the internet, so I will both take credit for it and offer you an exclusive discount on my course. While I’m waiting for your membership fee to arrive, I’ll be playing Critter Crops. It’s a witchy farming sim in which you grow odd pets and cast spells from flesh-bound grimoires. One of the verbs it offers on its Steam page is 'noodle'. Apologies to all the other games on my wishlist.\nRead more",

Movement is the entire basis for the puzzles in Arranger, and is hard to explain without showing you (if you're able to watch the trailer that will be helpful). The world of Arranger is divided into a grid, and you don't move the main character, feisty misfit kid Jemma, across the squares. Rather, imagine that the row or column Jemma is on becomes a travelator, and you control the direction and speed of it. Jemma stands still and you move the ground, and anything on it left, right, up or down - like How To Say Goodbye but with more squares. It's one of those things that makes sense when you're doing it, trust me.\nRead more",

Ředitelka uvedla, že taková myš není „nutně příliš vzdálená“ a bude záviset na aktualizacích softwaru, které budou pravděpodobně poskytovány prostřednictvím modelu předplatného. Takové řešení přirovnala k chytrým hodinkám, které taky není potřeba často měnit a mohou se dlouhodobě aktualizovat.",

They need to repair the bridge in order to enable travel in and out of Mistria, and as a perk of this, the Saturday Market can begin being held again. \n\n\nHow to get a Pickaxe and repair the bridge in Fields of Mistria\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nAt some point in the first week of your new life in Mistria, you'll receive a letter in the mail from Adeline, asking you to aid in repairing the bridge. After receiving this letter, head east to the bridge in order to trigger a cutscene. \n\n\nAfter this cutscene, a donation box will appear next to the bridge, and you'll need to donate the following resources: \n\n\n\n60 Wood\n\n\n60 Stone\n\n\n\nYou should already have an Axe to gather the needed Wood, thanks to an early morning meeting with Eiland, when you discovered the statue of Caldarus behind a tree on your farm. He'll give you the Worn Axe as a reward, and you can then use it to gather the 60 required Wood.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo get a Pickaxe, you'll need to pick up a quest from the Request Board in town. The quest you need is called ‘Do a Bro a Favor’, and simply requires you to head to the Blacksmiths and talk to Olric. When you speak to him, he’ll give you an Worn Pickaxe which you can then use to mine any small rock and get between one and two Stone. \n\n\nOnce you've got 60 wood and 60 Stone, you can head back to the bridge and place the resources into the box. Then all that's left to do is head back to Adeline to hand in the quest, triggering another cutscene and successfully repairing the bridge. \n\nThe post How to repair the bridge in Fields of Mistria appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, doing this requires you to earn an almost-currency outside of Tesserae — Essence. \n\n\nOnce you’ve removed the tree from in front of Caldarus’ statue and replaced his head, he’ll come to you in a dream and tell you about Essence and how to get it, but it may be a little unclear from his description, so I’ve got you covered. \n\n\nHow to get Essence in Fields of Mistria\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nOnce you’ve unlocked the ability to get it, Essence can appear randomly from many daily activities, including:\n\n\n\nFarming\n\n\nMining\n\n\nFishing\n\n\n\nYou’ll automatically absorb these Essences, so they’re easy to miss, but to see how many you have, simply check the UI.

          "description": "With Valorant being in open beta now, console players can get in on the fun that PC players have been experiencing for years. That being said, is Valorant crossplay compatible between PC and PS5? Here’s what we know.\n\n\nIs Valorant crossplay compatible between PC and PS5?\n\n\nUnfortunately, Valorant does not support crossplay between PC and PS5, nor does PC have that option with Xbox consoles. Due to the nature of the game, PC players do have a massive advantage over console players. This isn’t a game like Overwatch or recent Call of Duty games where the TTK (Time to Kill) is high enough so that those playing on a controller can have a fair gunfight. \n\n\nThe good news is that if you have a friend who plays on PC and you wish to play with them, cross-progression is an option. Whether you want to bring your console account to PC or they bring their PC account to an Xbox Series X/S or PS5, it’s possible.\n\n\nIs Valorant crossplay between PS5 and Xbox?\n\n\nLuckily, PS5 and Xbox players can match up and squad up together on Valorant. Since players on both consoles are on the same playing field, there are no advantages or disadvantages over the other. \n\n\nJust make sure you actually have the feature enabled so you can broaden your search pool when matchmaking.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nHow to enable crossplay on Valorant (PS5 and Xbox only)\n\n\nBy default, you should have crossplay enabled on Valorant if you’re playing the open beta on PS5 or Xbox. However, just to double-check that it’s on, press your menu or options button on your controller to bring up the Options menu.\n\n\nFrom here, select Settings. In the General tab, find the Privacy section and see that “Allow Crossplay” is set to on. You can also set other important options like limiting friend requests and hiding names.\n\n\nSo, unfortunately, you can’t match or link with PC players if you’re on PS5 or Xbox, but you can with other console players.\n\nThe post Is Valorant crossplay compatible between PC and PS5?

However, as this is an early Beta Playtest, it's very likely that the mechs will continue to receive balancing tuning ahead of release. As such, this Mech Tier List for Mecha Break is based purely off of the state of the beta playtest. \n\n\nAll mechs in the S Tier category are very strong and versatile, and always a solid option for any battle on any map in any mode in Mecha Break. Those in the A Tier are overall strong as well and should be able to hold up in every scenario, but may be weaker than an S Tier counterpart. The mechs in the B Tier have specific uses that make them advantageous in certain scenarios, but overall not as versatile as those in the S or A Tier. Finally, the lone mech in the C Tier, Falcon, is a bit under tuned at the moment and needs a little bit of lover to be considered a competitive option compared to the other mechs.\n\n\nUsing this Tier List, you can choose which Mechs you want to focus on farming currency for in order to unlock them. Of course, be sure to pick a mech that fits with your playstyle so make sure you're having fun!

          "description": "We're just a few weeks away from the launch of developer Massive Entertainment and publisher Ubisoft's open-world action-adventure game Star Wars Outlaws. In a post on the official Ubisoft blog, the publisher outlined the post-release content roadmap for Outlaws, detailing what is to come in the Season Pass which includes two Story Packs, two Cosmetic Bundles, and a launch day exclusive mission and character pack.\n\n\nImage by Ubisoft\n\n\nNot so Far Far Away\n\n\nPlayers who purchase the Gold Edition or Ultimate Edition of Star Wars Outlaws will automatically get the Season Pass, which includes the Kessel Runner character pack featuring outfits for Kay Vess and her companion Nix, as well as an exclusive mission called Jabba's Gambit. The mission gives access to an additional quest from the notorious Jabba Hutt and his Hutt Cartel. Both of these are available when Star Wars Outlaws is released.\n\n\nThe first Story Pack, Wild Card, is set to release in Fall 2024. Players will infiltrate a high-stakes Sabacc tournament as Kay before encountering notorious gambler Lando Calrissian, before evolving into a bigger game at play. The Hunter's Legacy and Cartel Ronin cosmetic bundles will launch alongside this story pack, including additional outfits for Kay and Nix as well as cosmetics for Kay's speeder and ship.\n\n\nIn Spring 2025 the second Story Pack, A Pirate's Fortune, will follow Kay as he runs into veteran pirate Hondo Ohnaka, who is attempting to settle old scores with a ruthless gang of pirates.\n\n\nBoth of the Story Packs sound promising in terms of story, so hopefully the core gameplay of Star Wars Outlaws is enough to make the DLC feel worth exploring. We'll know for sure soon as Star Wars Outlaws is set to release on all platforms later this month on August 30.\n\nThe post Start Wars Outlaws Post-Launch Roadmap includes two Story Packs appeared first on Destructoid.",

This obviously makes the glove a powerful one as well, especially for defence as it can help you get away from a tight spot and avoid the risk of falling off the map.\n\n\nUnlike many other gloves, obtaining the Boogie Glove in Slap Battles is more of a team effort as you will need your friends in order to gain it. To get the BoogieGlove, you need to first unlock the Boogie With It badge in Slap Battles.\n\n\nGet the Boogie With It Badge for the Slap Battles reward\n\n\nThe Boogie With It badge can be obtained when you have 16 people in a server doing any Roblox or Slap Battles emote. It does not have to be a specific emote, and there are no requirements of having a different glove unlocked already, in order to get the Boogie Glove. So, it won’t be as complicated as the Bus Glove, which takes multiple gloves and badges to earn it.\n\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\n\nTo do an emote in Slap Battles, press \"/\" on your keyboard, and then use any of the emote commands such as \"/e wave\", \"/e point\", or /e cheer.\n\n\nAll 16 players also do not have to be doing an emote, as players who are dancing after being affected by the Boogie ability also count towards the progress. So it is recommended that you hop onto a public server (this won’t work on a private server) with your friends who already have the Boogie glove. This way, other players can be forced into helping you get the Boogie glove.\n\n\nThe Boogie ability is called “Get Jazzy With It.” and once a player is affected by it, a glowing disco ball pops up over their head and plays music, while the player’s character dances for around 20 seconds, and has their gloves unequipped for that time period.\n\nThe post How to get the Boogie Glove in Slap Battles appeared first on Destructoid.",

Late in 2023, Gameloft shared a roadmap for 2024, and according to them we’ve got another update coming very soon.\n\n\nWe're getting into August now, and according to the Disney Dreamlight Valley roadmap released in December 2023, we’re due another update, complete with Tiana from The Princess and the Frog as a new villager, before the summer ends. \n\n\nImage via Gameloft\n\n\nAs well as Tiana and everything she could bring to the valley (I’m hoping for Naveen to arrive alongside her in frog form and desperate to have Ray as a companion, but I’m not holding my breath), those with the Rift in Time DLC are also due another update which will see the culmination of Jafar’s storyline along with the ability to finally fix the rift. \n\n\nWe’ve already seen everything else from the roadmap come to fruition, with Mike and Sulley having arrived in the valley with the Laugh Floor update in Feburary, Daisy Duck following in the Thrills & Frills update in May, and most recently Mulan and Mushu joining the ever expanding population in the Lucky Dragon update in June. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nOf course, with summer technically lasting until September 22, we might be waiting a little longer for the next update, but it’s definitely coming soon. It’s unknown exactly what will be included in the next update, outside of Tiana of course, but the hint that she will “bring new culinary delights” heavily suggests that the already very long list of recipes is about to grow.\n\nThe post Another Disney Dreamlight Valley update is due by summer’s end appeared first on Destructoid.",
