The UK-based outfit was responsible for some of the greatest games the world has ever seen – GoldenEye 007, Diddy Kong Racing, Perfect Dark, Blast Corps, Jet Force Gemini, Donkey Kong 64... it's no exaggeration to say that Rare rivalled Nintendo itself when it came to mastering the 64-bit system.

We open an estate agent to appraise the houses in games that would actually be good to live in. It turns out there aren't that many. Not a lot of them would be convenient. \nThere's an excellent Cavern Of Lies this week, in which Nate hosts a game-themed episode of Through The Keyhole in character as Lloyd Grossman/a robot version of Matt Berry. We also have some great diversions and some opening chat about the time my friend was a real life suspect in a murder for a few days.

There was just one bit of news that we’d all have to share. A man would drive around our village with the news in the back of his van, and we’d all come out of our houses to watch as he slid open the doors and pointed at it, saying “well, here is the news”. And it was the same news, every day. The news about the hole in the ozone layer. And it was all the news we needed.\r\n\n\nNot For Broadcast puts you in charge of all of the news. Set in an alternate timeline 1980s Britain in which an authoritarian far-left party has swept to power on a wave of populist policies, it casts the player as the lens through which the nation will view its new government. Seated in front of a bank of glowing screens, sliders and controls, you have the enviable power to switch between four live camera feeds, bleep out naughty words (and later subversive opinion), choose which ads to run during the break, and select which images are highlighted on screen during each news story.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The very concept of doing anything meaningful in an infinite void, let alone making it playable and entertaining, is a challenging one, and for every game that reaches for the stars there are countless kinds of... spiraling chaos orbitals.\nBetween its design flaws and unique ideas with semi-brilliant execution, the 2010 4X/wargame/economic/management simulation Distant Worlds: Universe has straddled those two experiences for a decade. It's needed a sequel for a long time. Distant Worlds 2 is that sequel, and it's almost upon us. Last week I attended a live demo and Q&A session with its producer and co-designer Erik Rutkins. With only a hands-off demo to go on I obviously can't say for sure how it plays yet, but it's already looking very promising.\nRead more",

Well, Extraction is a tactical FPS that builds on what made Outbreak great by repurposing Siege's PvP prowess into a moreish Left 4 Dead-like. Unpicking an alien hivemind with your mates is a real thrill, as is simply coming back from a mission alive. While it doesn't do anything to blow you away, it does more than enough to keep you coming back for a quick alien-busting session here and there.\nRead more",

Now, however, I am not so sure.  \r\n\nExpeditions: Rome, a historical CRPG blending turn-based combat, strategic army management, and lots of dialogue, has a pretty rubbish character creation system. There’s bugger all you can really do to customise your Roman. and after the mammoth character forge of Pathfinder: Wrath Of The Righteous, for example, it all just feels very sparse and shoestringy.

The ballistic ballet of Gears Tactics, which piled extra biceps atop XCOM’s shoulders. Even when money has moved through the membrane in the opposite direction, it has resulted in projects that were - let’s not overstate this - endearingly experimental. Can I get an understanding nod for Command & Conquer: Renegade?\nThe strangeness of Crossfire: Legion’s situation is that you might not recognise it as a spin-off at all. That’s because the series is a big old blind spot for the Western world. Crossfire is an enormously successful Korean FPS that bears more than a passing resemblance to Counter-Strike - all right angles, assault weapons, and de_dust2 - but dwarfs even Steam’s most popular game for player numbers. With 690 million participants across 80 countries, it’s the biggest online FPS in the world. In China, where the game is a major cultural force, a coming-of-age television drama about two young Crossfire players has been watched 1.8 billion times. Bridger-what? Geralt of Where? The upshot of all that success is that Crossfire radiates money, and some of it is now funding new games from prestigious Western developers. Remedy is working on a campaign FPS in the classic COD style. And Blackbird Interactive is building an RTS named Legion.\nRead more",

Waite in the 1909 Rider-Waite Tarot, he's a cocky young man in a floral tunic, standing by the seashore hefting a goblet. There's a fish peeking out of the goblet and the Page appears to be gossiping with it, perhaps sharing a joke about the artist, because honestly, what kind of artist paints a guy talking to fish. Or is he thinking about offering us the cup? The set of his jaw is ambiguous.\nWhen drawn in an upright position, the Page suggests a flash of inspiration reeled from the mind's ocean, or a dazzling opportunity. In this guise, he's been a good friend to Ami Y. Cai, a game creator and illustrator from Kentucky - though in her first Tarot deck, Stephanie Pui-Mun Law's Shadowscapes Tarot, the symbolism has been flipped around a little, the Page depicted as a mermaid peering into a steaming bowl. “Sometimes sparks come to me through conversations, or while I'm doing something else,” Cai tells me over Zoom. “So when I see the Page of Cups, I know that a creative opportunity is coming my way.”\nRead more",

There have been some great building games that have risen up, and even developer Blue Byte (now Ubisoft Dusseldorf)'s own Anno series has staked a powerful claim to the city-building throne. But this incarnation of The Settlers isn't so much about connecting to the series' past as it is about laying down foundations for the future. It's had a slightly rocky road to launch, suffering several delays and refunded pre-orders after being postponed indefinitely back in 2020, but at long last this reboot of the classic city-building conquest-me-do is finally ready to beat down our door and come barrelling in. It's launching in full on March 17th, and I've been hands on with an early version of the upcoming closed beta build that will be running from January 20th-24th. So settle in, folks.

When a job needed doing, then they'd steer me in the right direction. But for those initial sparks of story, my cellphone had been key. Chats and texts buzzed into my brain at all hours. \"Hey V\", \"V, got a minute?\", \"V!\"\nCharacters would get in contact with me, not the other way around. And I liked that. In fact, I'd say it helped build a living, breathing world more than Night City's towering skyscrapers and moving billboards. More than, perhaps, any other big RPG I've played over the last couple of years.\nRead more",

Sands Of Salzaar drops you into a world of dynamically warring factions. You can join or compete with them by founding your own, or ignore them to beat up roving bandits, clear out combined dungeon/random encounter sites, and do odd jobs for named NPCs. Some of those figures are powerful, unkillable, and recruitable, although you may have to win them over with favours or gifts. You'll likely do a bit of everything, but mostly you'll be smashing armies into each other in 2D skirmishes.\nIt's no clone, though. While its component parts are familiar, Salzaar does enough of its own thing to win my affection, and its odd but sincere personality shines despite some muddy edges.\nRead more",

Much like its undead predecessor, this is a game where four players team up and pew pew through waves of alien nasties. But it’s not as despairing as its zombified brethren. This is upbeat and colourful and at times, really quite silly.\nYes, it's still pretty similar to Left 4 Dead, but is home to a few things that help separate it from its zombified brethren. To test this stuff out, we had a full team of four in our hands-on preview session at the very end of last year – myself, Imogen (RPS in peace), Katharine, and Chet himself, who steered us through encounters with supreme patience. All in all, we sampled a ‘full run’, so a total of four levels, each with lots of, “Oh god, oh no,” moments. And it’s safe to say we had a lot of fun with it.\nRead more",

When Faye dies, Kratos & Son go on a journey to scatter her ashes from the top of a mountain. This becomes a micro rumination on familial relationships, a macro world-saving epic of legendary proportions, and a hack and slash fest that'll have you grinning from ear to ear. On balance, then, I am Team Fridge Faye.\nI played this God Of War on its previously exclusive release on PlayStation in 2018, and it lived in my memory as a 70 hour poetic battle between gods and monsters. Revisiting it again on PC, it turns out that it's actually only about 20 hours long, but it looms so large as an experience that turning it off at the end feels like stumbling into daylight, having spent many weeks in a firelit, sweaty hunting lodge in a Norwegian pine forest, slamming mead and singing songs about warriors tearing goats in two. There are a lot of big warriors in God Of War. There are a lot of very big things in it in general: statues, dragons, big angry rocks. And a big man, because the titular Kratos, as a yardstick to measure size, is already incongruously big, just so many sacks of salted beef held together by leather armour.\nRead more",

This turned out not to be the exciting selling point they expected for the open-world zombie-mashing parkour-o-shooter. Many found this claim exhausting because oh my god 500 hours is over 20 days, what do you think we do with our lives, and how much of that is busywork? After initially backtracking to clarify that 500 hours is how long it'd take to do absolutely everything, Techland have now explained that you can finish the game's main story in 20 hours, or 80 if you hit every side quest too.\nRead more",

But far from being a step down from World, Monster Hunter Rise is every bit its equal - and Capcom's stellar work with this PC port has given it a much-needed buff and polish to really make it shine. Not only does Rise offer the same seamless and expansive environments as World, but it also adds a few new twists to make tracking down its titular titans even more enjoyable. \nRead more",

It is a world simulation game that has no resource costs or goals, just simulated events. You make a world, plop some animals and fantasy races into it (and if you want, a bunch of dragons and wizards) and see what happens. I cannot stop playing it. And I wanted to give some more detailed examples of how the simulation works, especially if you just leave it running with little intervention.\nI am a WorldBox scientist, you see (though merely a BSc at the moment), and my first experiments suggest that every civilisation, along a long enough time scale, is basically doomed. Big 2022 energy. In the case of WorldBox, this may be because at some stage the scientist running the experiment will get bored and drop in e.g. a tornado. That's okay, because there are almost infinite experiments to run. I hope that isn't how the simulation I am living in is being run. Oh no. Don't think about it.\nRead more",

Join us on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central as three Game Informer editors shuffle their decks, strap on their duel disks, and face off for two hours in the newly-released Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel.\nYu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel is billed by Konami as the definitive video game adaptation of the popular card game. The free-to-play title is available on consoles and PC and lets players enjoy a highly produced simulation of the TCG with over 10,000 cards at their disposal. In addition to a solo mode, players can duke it out online across any platform thanks to cross-play. Cross-progression also allows players to enjoy the game anywhere, whether in front of a monitor, TV, or Switch screen. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nGame Informer’s elite duelists Marcus Stewart, Dan Tack, and John Carson will battle it out to decide who reigns as GI’s King of Games. Expect plenty of trash talk and anime-inspired buffoonery as we show off Master Duel’s features, modes, and maybe open some card packs to boot. \nWe can’t wait to hang out with you on Twitch and be sure to subscribe!

Thankfully, developer Magic Design Studios is ready to let players take Death for a whirl by annoucing the game will launch in Steam Early Access on March 8.\nThe game stars a very stressed-out Death whose underworld office has fallen into chaos thanks to his rambunctious employees running amok on Earth. Besides spoiling his vacation plans, this mayhem also upsets the balance of souls and that’s a big problem. Armed with your trusty scythe, you’ll have to keep your underlings in line the old-fashioned way.\nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nThe 2D game sports fast-paced hack n’ slash action where Death can wield over 30 different weapons. Since Death can’t die, success depends on completing stages repeatedly to earn better performance reviews to unlock new items. Death can also outfit itself with beneficial curses, though doing comes with a cost such as increasing enemy strength. \nMagic Design Studios plans to keep Have A Nice Death in Early Access for roughly one year, so we probably shouldn’t expect the full launch until 2023. The game will launch with several worlds and bosses available to conquer and the team will continue to add more content and fine-tune systems over the coming months.",

It was also supposed to come to Switch via cloud streaming that day, but that will no longer be the case.\nTechland has delayed the Switch version to an unspecified later date. The team’s reasoning is simply to, in their words via a press release, “provide fans with the gaming experience at the level they deserve and Techland wants to provide.” Techland promises the game will arrive on Switch within six months of Dying Light 2’s release, so (hopefully) expect it no later than July. \nDying Light 2 is a massive and ambitious game and getting it to perform well on Switch is likely no small feat, even if they’re utilizing cloud streaming instead of cramming it onto a traditional cartridge (which Techland did accomplish with the first game). That's a bummer for those hoping to enjoy the adventure on a handheld, but at least Dying Light 2 is only a couple of weeks from hitting other platforms.

Up until now, Guerrilla Games has kept much about the narrative under lock and key, but the latest trailer (which you can view above) is full of teases for Aloy's next adventure. It provided glimpses at some returning characters alongside new faces who are sure to shake up Aloy's journey – for better or worse. \nGuerrilla left fans with a lot to dissect and unpack in this new showing. Thankfully, we chatted with narrative director Benjamin McCaw and senior writer Annie Kitain to gain more clarity and context about what we saw. \nA Brief Recap\nThe trailer reiterated the tremendous plight in front of Aloy. \"The land is dying, people are suffering, and soon they'll starve,\" Aloy says…",

However, Nintendo merely said it would be coming in January at the time. Now, we know when. \nRevealed on Twitter, Nintendo says Banjo-Kazooie will hit Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack on January 20, or in other words, you can play this classic Nintendo 64 game starting tomorrow! Here's a trailer released by Nintendo to celebrate the news: \nEmbark on a wild quest with an unlikely pair! The adventures of Banjo and Kazooie begin here!\n#NintendoSwitch for #NintendoSwitchOnline + Expansion Pack members on 1/20! #Nintendo64 pic.twitter.com/R349r8gbvD\nJanuary 19, 2022\nThe original story continues below...\nOriginal Story, December 10, 2021:\nThe Nintendo 64 library of the Switch Online Expansion Pack gets a dose of Rare next month when Banjo-Kazooie joins the service.\nThe game joins the service sometime in January, but there's no exact date as of yet. The 1998 platformer is widely remembered as a standout game for the N64 (especially for third-party games) and among the most beloved games of the era overall. While the emulation of the Expansion Pack hasn't been universally loved, it's cool to see Banjo-Kazooie making its way back to the house of N. Given that Microsoft owns Rare, the only way to play Banjo was on Xbox, such as in the Rare Replay collection. \nBanjo’s on a mission to rescue his sister from the envious wicked witch Gruntilda!\n#NintendoSwitchOnline + Expansion Pack members in January! #Nintendo64 pic.twitter.com/pvPD4aRvwr\nDecember 10, 2021\nAs a reminder, Paper Mario joins the Expansion Pack library today.",

With its competition’s first-party lineup growing and subsequently shrinking selection of big third-party partners, Sony has a challenge ahead of it, to say the least. However, instead of staying toe-to-toe with Xbox by acquiring studios to keep up, it’s more important right now for Sony to develop a rival to Microsoft’s biggest boon this generation: Xbox Game Pass.\nOn paper, Microsoft has the option to wall off franchises like Warcraft, Diablo, and Call of Duty as Xbox console exclusives.

It’s been Xbox console exclusive since launch (and available on PC), but the ballad of Francis Vendetti will soon find a new audience.\nThat’s because the game is launching on PlayStation consoles and Switch on January 25. If you’re unfamiliar, The Artful Escape spins the yarn of Francis Vendetti, a musician and the nephew of a famous folksinger who finds himself pigeonholed to expectations of following in his uncle’s stylistic footsteps. It’s not until an alien ship arrives and whisks Francis off to an intergalactic space odyssey does he begin to discover his true voice. The gameplay itself consists of simple side-scrolling platforming, but the real stars are the killer soundtrack, gorgeous visuals, and top-notch performances from names like Carl Weathers and Lena Headey. There’s a reason it earned an 8.5 review score from us.\nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nWill you be picking up The Artful Escape on PlayStation or Switch? Let us know in the comments!",

          "description": "Yesterday, 343 Industries announced that starting this week, it would be making some changes to the Halo Infinite price store. Specifically, the studio was going to make changes to how it packages and prices items in the store. The store was updated today, just like it is every Tuesday, and as promised, those price changes are evident. \nThe most notable change is the general decrease in price, especially for large bundles that feature cosmetic coatings for armor, weapons, and vehicles. That’s evident with the 1200 credit-priced Neon Superfly bundle, which will cost roughly $10. In weeks past, a bundle like that would have cost roughly $17.\nThe vehicle coating bundle called Zodiac River, which gives warthogs and more a rainbow-esque coating and adds new tires to roll in the battlefield, is also available for what appears to be a cheaper-than-usual price at just 500 credits. \nThat same type of bundle might have cost a couple of hundred credits more in previous weeks. The boost and swap pack, which gives players Double XP boosts and Challenge Swaps for 200 credits, is the same price as usual. \nThere’s also a Neon Beat bundle that includes an Epic Mythic Effect set, a purple visor, and more for 1000 credits. Plus, the Keep It Clean bundle that costs 500 credits is available and it includes a nameplate, an AI, and more.\nBoth it and the Neon Beat bundle appear to be priced similarly to weeks past, but the bigger Neon Superfly bundle is undoubtedly cheaper than it might have been had it gone live on the Halo Infinite store in a previous week. \nFor more about the game, check out the Game Informer Halo Infinite hub and then keep an eye on our story about what’s available in the Halo Infinite shop, which is updated weekly.\nAre you excited about these new prices or do you feel they could be adjusted even further?

          "description": "The everchanging world of Fortnite received a significant update today. As the weather heats up and spring approaches, frozen sections of the game's map are thawing. One such area has melted to reveal the return of Titled Towers, a popular location filled with towers that was a part of Fortnite's first battle royale map.\nThe great thaw also has awakened new life in the form of giant dinosaurs called Klombos. These peaceful beasts are roughly the size of a bus and are roaming the world looking for things to eat, especially Klomberries. When they consume something, their color changes. You can interact with these beasts. Try running up a Klombos tail and see what happens when you reach the blowhole on its head. If you shoot a Klombo, it will attack you. That blowhole is also a weapon. So far, you can find two Klombos on the map – one to the northwest of the Daily Bugle and another to the west of Titled Towers.\nIn a few matches I played this morning, Titled Towers proved to be a popular destination with what seemed to be half of players descending upon it to see what has changed. You may want to arm yourself and shield up before landing at this fun spot. If you collect characters, you'll find two have been added to the game in slots 21 and 22.\nMore significant changes will likely be on the way to Fortnite in a few weeks, as The Foundation and Haven Masks battle pass rewards unlock in 16 days. The item shop also updates daily at 6 p.m. CT. It'll be interesting to see if Epic Games ties in any character skins and items with the return of Titled Towers. Maybe a Klombo trainer? We'll find out later today.",

Seriously, though. Play Ys VIII and IX!\nComing in a major update to the Steam version of the game is local co-op. In the trailer above you can see the feature in action, which lets a second player take control of someone as long as multiple playable characters are present in the scene. In the Steam post announcing the update, it talks about the changes from co-op in the previous Ys title, saying, \"the second player is largely equivalent to the primary player in terms of capabilities in Ys IX, including movement and combat abilities, using Monstrum Gifts, discovering and triggering landmarks, enemies and events, opening chests, picking up collectibles, and initiating dialogue. Only interacting with menus and the map is restricted to player one.\" Pretty impressive for shoehorning multiplayer into a decidedly single-player experience.\nAlso joining the game is 16:10 support, which allows for slightly narrower displays to be supported. One of those displays sporting that aspect ratio is the upcoming Steam Deck handheld device, which the developers luckily had on hand to snap a picture of the game running on it. \nTopping off the update are some bug fixes to clean up some issues from launch. You can check out the full developer post right here. \nHave you played Ys IX and does multiplayer sound like a way you'd want to play it? Let us know in the comments!",

From God of War to Red Dead Redemption II and everything in between, join Game Informer as we pick the best games of 2018 and form the ultimate fantasy teams.\nBut how does the process work? The panel of Ben Reeves, John Carson, Kim Wallace, Alex Stadnik, and Alex Van Aken have assembled to select five games apiece from 2018 to create the most robust roster possible. After randomizing the draft order, each person will have time to decide. At the end of the round, the order reverses, and the fun continues from the fifth person back to the first.\nSounds pretty standard, right? You can fill your list with as many great games as possible and create the video game equivalent of the 1990s Chicago Bulls. That's where you're wrong. If you've played fantasy sports before, you're well aware that picking players in the late rounds can get rough. In that spirit, each panel member in today's video must select one title off Metacritic's list of the worst games of 2018. In a year of such high highs, it's incredible how low the lows can get.\nBut why are we drafting games like this? Just for fun? Why no, for the community validation, of course! That's right, folks. You get to vote on who has the strongest list. Be sure to head over to our Discord to select the editor with the strongest list, and we'll read the results on this week's episode of The GI Show!

Using data and community feedback, we’re going to begin rolling out changes to how we package and price items in Halo Infinite – and it all starts next week.\" His thread continues, \"Starting Tuesday, the Shop experience will vary week-to-week.

Using data and community feedback, we’re going to begin rolling out changes to how we package and price items in @Halo Infinite – and it all starts next week.\nJanuary 15, 2022\nWith the week-to-week adjustments being made, it seems like the in-game store will be evolving and changing based on trends over the coming months. Hook speaks to that in his third tweet, saying, \"We will be trying new things throughout the rest of the season so that we can continue to learn and improve for the future. Please keep the feedback coming during this process and I hope to see you all next week for the Cyber Showdown event!\" \nWhat the changes are, we'll just have to wait and see.

Set on the doomed planet Reach, players control a new member of the Spartan Noble Team as they valiantly defend the human-occupied world from a massive Covenant invasion. The time and setting gave Bungie creative freedom to introduce new characters and flesh out an event that had only been referenced in books, while the multiplayer introduced new (though divisive) mechanics such as armor abilities. \nJoin hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves) and Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and Polygon's Mike Mahardy (@mmahardy) as we unpack the history and impact of Halo's most emotionally charged entry to that point. And for more Halo, be sure to check out our definitive ranking of every Halo game.\nCheck out the rest of our podcast on the Video Gameography hub.

Landmasses take the form of islands and, to promote the game's spirit of contribution, one of these could be custom-made by you. \nNo game development experience is necessary. If you have the imagination and some decent artistic chops, you're as qualified as any other entrant. Your concept can be a drawing, a 3D model, or whatever visual representation you prefer. There are some rules to note, which you can read in full here. The major stipulations are that the winners won't be paid for this, and they'll surrender claims to any intellectual rights their creation. Winners will be included in the game's credits, however. It probably goes without saying that designs featuring plagiarized elements or are overtly violent and/or sexual will be disqualified.\nYou can submit entries beginning today by visiting the contest's website. Submissions close on February 1, and Q-Games will announce the winners on July 15. Given that timeframe, it's likely The Tomorrow Children won't be relaunching during the first half of the year. We'll have to see if it makes it out again before the end of 2022 and if it will remain a PlayStation exclusive now that Q-Games has regained the rights. \nWhat do you think of this contest?

          "description": "Last month, due to the overwhelming queue times to access Final Fantasy XIV servers, digital game sales and certain services were suspended until things calmed down. Now, Square Enix is preparing to allow fresh accounts to be created in a couple of weeks.\nAccording to a developer blog post, January 25 will be the date digital sales of Final Fantasy XIV will be resumed. The move coincides with the already-planned opening of a new Oceanian data center, bringing five new worlds into existence, hopefully alleviating congestion on other worlds. This also means the suspended Home World Transfer Service will also be brought back on January 25, letting players bring their character to these new servers, or elsewhere barring any limitations imposed on still-overpopulated worlds.
