          "description": "Bloomin' lovely.\nWhen cosy and wholesome games first stepped onto the scene, they were counter-culture — created in response and in resistance to an industry that churned out violence, conflict, and a particular type of masculinity that wasn't keen on things like emotions or intimacy. Some people were tired of this monolithic and exclusionary idea of what a game 'should' be — and so, as a direct contrast to all of that, the cosy game movement was created, prioritising stories that minimised conflict, and focused instead on growth and creation. That's part of the reason why so many cosy games are about farming and relationships, because the themes of cultivation and creation are almost the exact opposite of violence and conflict.\nBut these days, cosy games have become a dominant part of gaming culture, and the conflict-free alternatives they once offered as a respite from the status quo are now a lucrative part of the status quo. This is what happens when counter-culture becomes culture: it forgets its roots and its purpose, and instead becomes about aping what's already popular. In the process, many cosy games fail to understand that a player's desire for softness and kindness does not mean that they want a completely toothless game. Challenge is not conflict. Challenge is fun.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The lack of being able to quickly and easily remap buttons in many Nintendo first-party games is just a start, but there are often mechanics that require multiple button prompts, or simple commands that require you to press different buttons per game.\nIt's not an across-the-board problem, but we know Nintendo can — and should — do better. Both Sony and Microsoft have their own accessibility controllers: the PS Access Controller and the Xbox Adaptive Controller.

Having beat them myself, I didn't find them a fun or interesting challenge as much as an annoying one that required too much to go right. I'm glad to hear that they're being tweaked in an upcoming patch, which you can now test in a public beta on Steam, and even the lowest difficulty setting will be tweaked. Other changes include improved (hopefully) Steam Deck performance, balance tweaks, and better Joker-related Tags.\nRead more",

          "description": "When Bethesda was working out how to turn their popular Elder Scrolls RPGs into an online behemoth to rival World Of Warcraft back in the late 00s, the initial pitch was \"Elder Scrolls with friends,\" creative director Rich Lambert tells me. A simple idea on paper, perhaps, but one that proved to be a lot more complicated in the realisation of it. Zenimax Online Studios was founded in 2007, a year after The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion landed to universal critical praise, but it wasn't until seven years later that The Elder Scrolls Online finally released for PC in 2014. At launch \"we were walking this weird line between 'online game' and 'Elder Scrolls game',\" Lambert says. \"We didn't do either of them particularly well.\"\nTen years later, though, The Elder Scrolls Online is thriving. At last count, the game has over 24 million players galloping about the plains of Tamriel, and later this June, it will receive its eighth major Chapter expansion, Gold Road, which adds Oblivion's West Weald to the game and wraps up the mystery of the new Daedric Prince that arrived at the end of the previous expansion, Necrom. But the path ESO has taken to get here hasn't been nearly as glittering, with its PC launch in particular generating \"a lot of feedback\", as studio director Matt Firor told press at the game's tenth anniversary event last week. In fact, it wasn't until ESO came to consoles in 2015 that the game really found its voice, says Lambert. \"We had to really figure out what we wanted to be, and we chose 'Elder Scrolls'. As soon as we hit that core pillar of 'It's Elder Scrolls first, online second,' then it really just helped inform everything we've done since.\" Trouble is, when the thrust of ESO's development straddled the launch of two very different Elder Scrolls games, even nailing down that first part of the pillar proved to be more challenging than expected.\nRead more",

It's a puzzle game about growing plants. Holy Strange Horticulture, Batman! But Botany Manor is much less eldritch, and much more gentle historical feel-good movie starring Emma Thompson in the lead role. That role - which in this case is played by you in first person rather than La Thompson - is of Arabella Greene, a retired botanist who, thank God, is the childless inheritor of a huge manor and ancestral wealth, and so is able to spend the sunny days of 1890 pottering around the house and grounds researching weird, slightly fantastical plants almost wholly untroubled. So in this respect it is also a fantasy game. It's quite delightful, which is the sort of phrase I am confident Arabella would use.\nRead more",

          "description": "According to one unofficial tracker created by video game artist Farhan Noor, there have been 8000 layoffs in 2024 so far, following an estimated 10,500 layoffs in 2023. The leaders of Microsoft, Embracer Group, Epic and other industry giants have made swingeing cuts to their workforces. While larger companies have inevitably seen the largest reductions, many smaller developers and publishers have also cut staff or even closed their doors. Circumstances vary by company, of course, but as regards the biggest publishers, there are some broad overlapping causes: reckless or, if you prefer, \"overambitious\" expansion and overhiring during the pandemic lockdown gaming boom; lower-than-hoped returns on new technologies and business models such as NFTs; and rising global interest rates, which have scared away potential investors.\nThe carnage was uppermost in Larian CEO's Swen Vincke's mind when he accepted Baldur's Gate 3's Best Narrative gong at the GDC Awards last month. According to Vincke, the layoffs can be traced straightforwardly to a pattern of executive greed that sees company leadership betting the livelihoods and stability of their workers on whatever new idea seems capable of delivering instant growth for shareholders.\n Read more",

          "description": "Yesterday, if you can believe it, marked the tenth anniversary of The Elder Scrolls Online. That's a whole decade of tromping across Tamriel with your mates, and a whole decade in which I've watched tentatively from the sidelines, thinking about dipping my toes into the MMO pool, but never quite building up the courage (or lining the walls of my bank account) to fully take the plunge. I've heard all the horror stories about starting a new MMO from other members of the RPS Treehouse - particularly when it comes to the lore-laden shackles of World Of Warcraft and the bloated MMO-service-hybrid Destiny - and quite honestly, it's enough to put me off them all entirely. But The Elder Scrolls Online might just be the exception to the rule.\nI spent a portion of the game's tenth birthday yesterday playing Gold Road, its upcoming eighth Chapter expansion. In it, you're whisked over to the West Weald, an autumnal, sun-dappled region whose main city hub, Skingrad, will no doubt feel familiar to seasoned Oblivionites. Seemingly overnight, a strange jungle has sprung up on the city's outskirts, uprooting the nearby villages of the neighbouring high elves and causing havoc as strange beasts pour out of its curling root beds. There are more mysteries to unravel here, too, including the emergence of the new Daedric Prince, Ithelia (revealed at the end of last year's Necrom Chapter), and much more besides - too much to realistically take in during a 90-minute preview session, or for this MMO newbie to fully comprehend the significance of. But there's something about Gold Road and its gnarled-up jungles, strange cults and fantastical beasts that's definitely made me want to make a return journey here when it launches on PC on June 3rd.\nRead more",

Our System Shock review called it \"a breathtakingly beautiful and astonishingly faithful remake that proves the enduring power of Looking Glass design\" when it launched last year, though I would say System Shock's final battle is one of the most dated parts, so I'm curious to see the new form.\nRead more",

You can find Roblox Studios' full response over on Eurogamer.\nOriginal story\nRoblox allows its players to create and monetise their own creations within its ecosystem. Across the entire breadth of Roblox game makers, a lot of money is made. At the individual level, however, the vast majority of creators making work within Roblox never earn enough to cash out their earnings - and some of those creators are children. This has long led to allegations that Roblox is exploiting child labour, generating value for Roblox Studio and its shareholders in the process.\r\n\n\"I don't know, you can say this for a lot of things, right?\" said Roblox Studio head Stefano Corazza at GDC, when the allegation was put to him by Eurogamer. \"Like, you can say, 'Okay, we are exploiting, you know, child labour,' right? Or, you can say: we are offering people anywhere in the world the capability to get a job, and even like an income. So, I can be like 15 years old, in Indonesia, living in a slum, and then now, with just a laptop, I can create something, make money and then sustain my life.\r\n\n \nRead more",

You can also now cancel a Pal's break simply by picking them up and throwing them at the worksite - truly, a scene from Dickens.

In the space of a single, rollercoaster paragraph, Betts earned my curiosity by describing himself as a fellow Soul Reaver enthusiast, lost it again by criticising Soul Reaver’s camera - such insolence! - and earned it swiftly back by mentioning that he’s from Yorkshire. Then, he upgraded my curiosity into attention by describing The Horror At Highrook as a “clockwork narrative” horror experience that takes inspiration from Poe, Stoker and Lovecraft on the one hand, and from boardgames, wiki-hunting and escape rooms on the other.\nThis is a heady brew indeed. Also, there appears to be a cat in the game called Mr Tubbs, described as a “portly grey barrel of fur”. I entertain suspicions of Mr Tubbs. What fell secrets lurk behind his perfectly groomed exterior? Anyway, here’s the trailer.\n Read more",

It's a pungent, potted commentary on the machinations of Youtube celebrity, with heady notes of \"cautionary tale about algorithmic content generation\" and \"cautionary tale about people endangering or hurting themselves being a dependable source of views\".

Launched back in 2014 after seven years in development, ESO's hybrid of deceptively single-player-ish Elder Scrolls presentation with MMO fixtures attracted a lukewarm response, initially. “At its best The Elder Scrolls Online looks like a faithful addition to the lore,” intoned Brendy in our own launch impressions. “At its worst it is a derivative and uninventive anachronism.”\nZeniMax Online have made big strides with the game over the years, however - binning off monthly subscriptions and introducing a “level-free” format in the One Tamriel update in 2016. ESO has also swelled and sprouted steadily as a work of geography and history, with major chapters introducing areas hitherto only mentioned in dusty collectible tomes, or creatively reintroducing locations from the single player series – the forthcoming Gold Road expansion, out in June 2024, takes us to the West Weald in Cyrodiil, an area last seen in The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "In Keepsake's co-op four-player space game Jump Ship, née Hyperspace, you can scuttle your own vessel by overcooking a pizza. There's a cooking minigame in your ship's canteen which grants a health boost if you nail the timing, and sparks off a fire if you don't.\nIt's a pretty minor fire, mind you. A combusting deep dish doesn't place very highly on the list of possible ship emergencies next to, say, your reactor coughing up nuclear rods, or your engines running out of juice because some oaf hooked up too many turrets to the aforesaid reactor. But if you leave the fire unchecked, perhaps because you're busy disposing of radioactive waste or vengefully unplugging half the point defences, it'll eventually singe your ship's health to nothing - insert appropriate Steam achievement pun and/or Klingon proverb. It's an agreeable little note of idiocy in a game that takes cues from Valve's timeless anecdote generator Left 4 Dead, Sea Of Thieves, FTL and, perhaps most surprisingly, Diablo.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Whether you’re charging across its pixel-art battlefields slashing and burning increasingly tough-to-crack strongholds, or making quick decisions to get the upper hand in its tug-of-war tactics, the only times Thorald is not doing cool violence, commanding others to do cool violence, or upgrading his camps so that he may act in cooler and more violent ways, is when he’s restoring stamina with a cool slug of mead or violently gnawing at health-boosting meat.\nViking Thorald Olavson is a man possessed. A rival Jarl burnt his village and nicked his wife Raya. In his quest to find her, he’s prepared to do anything - even visit England. As Thorald, you’ll butcher your way up a chain of command in your search for Raya across six stages, each of which sits somewhere between the side-scrolling tactics of Kingdom Two Crowns, the lane strategy of a Warpips, and the slashy/blocky/shooty/dodgy of any 2D ARPG you care to name.\n \nRead more",

I don’t want to alarm anyone, but I think I may have even sensed the fading ghost of an immeasurably whisper-thin ray of sunshine at one point. Enough! Says a new patch for co-op shooter Helldivers 2. You know who else enjoys basking in the pleasant glow of mildly enjoyable weather when there’s freedoms that need fighting for? Bug sympathisers, that’s who. As such, the developers have gone and added new planetary hazards in the form of blizzards and sandstorms, alongside the usual balance tweaks.\nAlongside these reminders that the war for democracy is never comfortable, the efficiently-named Patch 01.000.200 also includes a host of tweaks. Notable among these are balancing changes to the mission type ‘Retrieve Essential Personnel’, which now sounds more manageable. Enemy spawn points have been placed further away from the objective, “to give players a fairer chance of defending the location.” Additionally, fewer civilians are needed to beat the mission on higher difficulties.\n \nRead more",

Soon static monsters appear in their own isolated windows you'll have to shoot your way towards (their attacks can cross the void between), and before long there are the horrible hateful little blue bastards who sit there passively, soaking up shots and never attacking but actively pulling the edges of the window towards them.\nIt's a clever and great little thing and I sort of hate it as much as I like it.\nRead more",

          "description": "So, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, eh? I liked it a lot. 150 hours a lot. I big cried at least twice and welled up, much like a well, many other times. As much as I’d like to wax emotional about the plot and characters in an endless lifestream-of-consciousness ramble, articles need both headlines and subjects (truly an act of conspiratorial violence targeted at my personal dadaist instincts). So, let’s talk about just the minigames, because I think they’re wonderful for all sort of reasons that might not be immediately apparent.  Naturally, big spoiler potential ahead if, like me, you consider everything you haven’t experienced in the RPG game a spoiler.\nI think one of OG Final Fantasy’s 7 best tricks is how it doesn’t just dish out its strangest distractions as a palette cleanser to the main meal of its action and drama, but actively works them in as an indispensable part of the menu. It also does this all without a shred of shame or self-consciousness, resulting in a cinematic video game with no inner turmoil or resentment toward either part of that equation - a characteristic I feel is suffered from by many of the games for which FF7 lead the way. Take the Gold Saucer. It’s an excuse to dick around and ride motorbikes, sure, but it’s also an essential story beat while the party takes time to relax and enjoy each other’s company away from the stress of travel and battle.\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Respawn Entertainment rolled out an update that addresses matchmaking in Apex Legends Ranked, fixes an issues with badges, and more. \n\n\nOn April 3, an Apex Legends update went awry, as players lost Heirlooms and progression. Respawn Entertainment sprung into action fast and released a hot fix before the end of that day, resolving everything beside the incorrect badges displaying in Ranked. So, the devs came back and delivered another update on April 8. Previously earned badges will now display the correct rank, and the patch also included a few surprises. \n\n\nThe most recent Apex Legends update addresses Ranked Play matchmaking. Image via EA\n\n\nThe devs reworked Ranked matchmaking so parties now have a limit of a three-rank tier difference between players. For example, a Diamond player won't be able to squad with someone in Bronze, and vice versa. This should prevent high-leveled competitors from trying to manipulate the system to get easier matches. \n\n\nThe update also fixed a connection error called labeled \"Code:Cloud\" when a player tried to reconnect after a crash. Additionally, community members can now correctly see previews of gifts when receiving them. Finally, the update made various minor fixes for localization, items, and cosmetics to iron out any lingering impact from the previous scare, and Switch users should have a more stable experience when trying to play Apex Legends.  \n\n\nPlayers no longer have to worry about losing their progression when logging in, and this update should make Ranked feel like a more balanced experience. Between the recent slip-up, and the worrying hack that happened during the Apex Legends Global Series tournament at the end of March, hopefully the battle royale title can go at least a few weeks without scaring community members. \n\nThe post Apex Legends update puts restrictions on Ranked parties and fixes badges glitch appeared first on Destructoid.",

At first, I believed it to be a new Call of Duty bug or something wrong with my file until I made an embarrassing conclusion: Oh, right, it's the solar eclipse today.\n\n\nEven though it took me a while to put two and two together, it was pleasing to see the skies changing hues — well, at least for the moment after I got shot at for looking at the pretty colors. If you want a front-row seat for this event, go to Rebirth Island in Warzone and wait for the solar eclipse. It won't happen immediately, so survive as long as possible until you see that stunning picturesque shot. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nWarzone's Rebirth Island solar eclipse update doesn't do much gameplay-wise. There are no unique objectives to complete, nor is there a mission to take down the Fire Lord for those Avatar: The Last Airbender fans out there. The update is merely for appearance purposes, but it could be used to your advantage. Given that the sky goes dark, it's a perfect time to unleash a sneak attack while the solar eclipse triggers. \n\n\nSome players mentioned that there were no Contracts or Loot Caches during this Season 3 event. However, this particular feature seems to have been patched, and I have even confirmed that myself. \n\n\nWhile it is fascinating to gaze at Warzone's solar eclipse update, remember that the match is still ongoing. Just don't make the same mistakes as I did, and try to step away from the high-active player zones.

We learn about his childhood fascination with becoming a manga artist, the transition from college life to working at Sega, and his early career developing games like Devi and Pii, Golden Axe 3, and Sonic the Hedgehog 3. Iizuka remembers the excitement and challenge during the transition from the Sega Genesis (known as the Sega Mega Drive in Japan) to the Sega Saturn, which allowed the team progress from 2D pixel art to 3D polygonal modeling.\nNotably, the Sonic the Hedgehog lead reflects on the early Dreamcast days, moving to the United States to better implement western culture into Sonic Adventure 2, and finally, describes his emotions after hearing Sega was exiting the hardware business and ending production of the Dreamcast. \nSonic the Hedgehog Lead Reflects on SEGA's Road to Dreamcast:\n\n\nPlease subscribe to Game Informer's YouTube channel if you enjoy this video.

However, it looks like a second season is already in the works. \nVariety reports (thanks, Eurogamer) that The California Film Commission has awarded $152 million in tax incentives to a dozen TV shows across various studios to lure production of those series into the state. $25 million of these tax credits has been allocated to Fallout's second season, so production is now expected to take place in California. Fallout’s $153 million budget is the largest of any show on this list\nSeason 1 was largely filmed in New York, with some production in Utah. However, as Variety notes, receiving this tax credit does not guarantee Amazon will accept it and relocate Fallout's production to California for Season 2.\n\n\nFallout premieres on Amazon Prime Video on Thursday, April 11. The eight-episode series is directed by Westworld showrunners Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy, with Bethesda head Todd Howard serving as executive producer.

Plus, Tae says there will be no microtransactions in the game, save for one theoretical exception. \nThis news comes from a new interview with Korean publication Ruliweb, where Tae explained that while Stellar Blade will have a New Game+ mode at some point, it won't be available at launch, as translated by Genki_JPN on Twitter. Tae also told Ruliweb that players should not expect any microtransactions in Stellar Blade, but notes that one exception would be paid collaborations with another company's IP. \n\n\n\"We want to make it clear at this point that Stellar Blade will not require any additional expenses that gamers are not aware of beyond what they paid for the package,\" Tae told Ruliweb. \"The only exception is if we create collaboration costumes with another company's IP; those may be sold for a fee. Also, there is no New Game+ in the launch version, so please look forward to it being updated very soon.\" \nGiven that no collaborations have been announced at this point, Tae is likely just checking bases for hypothetical collaborations ShiftUp may or may not be pursuing. At any rate, given the popularity of ShiftUp's Goddess of Victory: NIKKE game on mobile devices, it's possible we see an internal collaboration between those two properties. \nStellar Blade is an action game launching on PlayStation 5 exclusively on April 26. It was announced in 2021 as Project EVE. There is a demo for Stellar Blade available on PSN that you can download right now if you're curious about how the game plays. \nFor more, read Game Informer's Stellar Blade feature for behind-the-scenes details and new insight from Tae. \n[Source: Ruliweb]\nAre you excited for Stellar Blade?

It's also how we learned the game will run at 30 FPS on Xbox Series X/S. \nSpeaking to German publication GamePro, Hellblade II visual effects director Mark Slater-Tunstill confirmed the game will run at 30 FPS alongside dynamic scaling on Xbox Series X/S, as reported by Wccftech. Slater-Tunstill told GamePro the 30 FPS makes sense with the game's more cinematic nature. However, if you're after higher frames, a beefier PC can likely accomplish that. \n\n\nRegardless of frames, Hellblade II is sure to be stunning visually. Developed in Epic Games' Unreal Engine 5, Ninja Theory told Polygon this engine has allowed the game's more realistic nature to be achievable, thanks to its Nanite geometry system and because \"the turnaround between scanning the thing and putting it in the level is drastically cut, and you can spend that time finessing.\" Be sure to read Polygon's full Hellblade II preview for more details on what to expect visually from this game. \nHellblade II hits Xbox Series X/S and PC on May 21. \nFor more, watch the latest Hellblade II trailer here, and then read about Hellblade II's photo mode and what to expect from it at launch.

Speaking with the developer over e-mail, the team says, \"We have been able to double the frame rate to 60 fps, added anti-aliasing, and implemented higher resolution settings so that players can take advantage of the power of a high-end PC.\" The game's layout has also been adjusted for the PC version.\nStar Wars: Galaxy of Heroes originally launched for mobile devices back in 2015, and has amassed a following over the years. In that time, players have figured out ways to emulate the game on PC, but this will be an official release. Along with improved visuals, the game will also support mouse and keyboard as well as keybinds (unfortunately \"there is no controller support at this time\"). Longtime players will also be able to bring all their progress over by linking their mobile account to their EA account when playing on PC for the first time, and all future updates will release on both mobile and PC platforms simultaneously. The teams says, \"The PC and mobile version will always be in lockstep and release updates at the same time.\"\nBeta access for the PC version will be available for current mobile players in May before expanding to a larger audience. From the developer: \"For those interested, they can head to the Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes website, sign up for the EA App, link their account, and they are now ready to register. There’s a dedicated registration page that can be found on the website the day registration begins!

He revealed this during a recent interview with IGN, where he also confirmed Saber took Star Wars: KOTOR Remake with it following its split from Embracer Group. \nLast month, Embracer Group, the company behind the closure of Saints Row studio Volition Games and layoffs at companies like Black Forest Games and Eidos-Montréal, sold Saber in a $500 million deal. It sold the studio, which is also developing the first-person adventure Jurassic Park: Survival, to a group of private investors under Beacon Interactive, which is controlled by Karch. At the time of the sale, the company didn't mention its Star Wars: KOTOR Remake, leaving excited fans concerned for the game, which itself has already gone through some rocky development. \n\n\nNow, thanks to Karch's interview with IGN, we know the game is still in development. \n\"It's clear and it's obvious that we're working on this,\" Karch told the publication. \"It's been in the press numerous times. What I will say is that the game is alive and well, and we're dedicated to making sure we exceed consumer expectations.\" \nThat's all Karch shared about the remake, however, and IGN writes that in an investor call following the announcement of Saber's sale, Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors implied the remake might still be a long ways away. \nFor more about the game, watch the Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake reveal trailer, and then read about how Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic's biggest issue is how it plays.

Hours after the sale, some Gearbox employees announced on social media that they had been let go from the company. Today, Gearbox has confirmed these departures.\nIn a statement to Eurogamer, Gearbox states that an unknown number of employees have been let go but that those affected are not tied to the development of upcoming games. Gearbox stated last week that it has six titles in the works, including a new Borderlands game. \n\"As we strive towards our mission to entertain the world, we are grateful that our talent and capability are of interest to you and your audience,\" says Gearbox as part of its statement. \"The Embracer Group will continue to report on their restructuring program that impacted some parts of Gearbox today that are not tied to the development of Gearbox Software games.\"\nWhile Gearbox has not divulged the number of staff members let go, several employees took to social media soon after the announcement of the sale to announce their departures. Among them, Gearbox PR manager Jennifer Locke stated on X that she and “countless others” had been affected, as surfaced by Eurogamer.  \nEmbracer sold Gearbox (after acquiring it for 1.3 billion in 2021) as part of an ongoing effort to reduce costs after betting on a $2 billion deal with Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group that ultimately fell through last year. Embracer has spent the last few months either selling off its studios, shutting them down, or laying off employees as part of a massive restructuring process to recoup losses from this failed deal. \n[Source: Eurogamer]",

Ahead of the game's release on April 16 (on Game Pass as well as other platforms), Charles Harte and I decided to take a look at an early portion of the game, discuss the developers' intentions for the narrative and gameplay, and detail how the game was made.\nFor a whole lot more on Harold Halibut, you can read this feature where I interviewed game director Ole Tillmann and art director Onat Hekimoglu.\n\n\nHead over to Game Informer's YouTube channel for more previews, reviews, and discussions of new and upcoming games.

First revealed in 2021, the Sekiro-inspired title is coming on May 29.\nNine Sols sports a hand-drawn art direction and an aesthetic that blends sci-fi, cyberpunk, Eastern mythology (the legend of Hou Yi in particular), and Taoism. Players control a cat-like warrior named Yi, who is awakened after years of slumber in New Kunlun, a city for humans created by nine god-like rulers. New Kunlun may appear to be a utopia, but a secret surrounds it as Yi embarks on a vengeful quest to take down all nine rulers. \n\n\nThe 2D Metroidvania features fast-paced combat and a parry system directly inspired by Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. In addition to a sword, Yi is armed with a divine bow and uses Taoist talismans to make enemies explode. A sprawling, interconnected map features numerous NPCs to assist, secrets, and challenging boss battles. \nNine Sols is coming to PC via Steam (it also has a demo). You can learn more about Nine Sols’ creation and the history of Red Candle Games by reading our studio profile.",

After quietly working on its first project, the team is ready to show the world what it’s been cooking up.\nThe studio released a brief teaser of their yet-to-be-titled first game. A press release states that this mysterious project is a fantasy action-adventure title targeting a 2025 release. We won’t find out more until April 2, when IGN will reveal the game as an IGN First. \n\n\nThe studio also included two pieces of concept art, which you can view in the gallery below.\n\nYellow Brick Games was founded by Thomas Giroux (co-founder/CEO), Jeff Skalski (co-founder/COO), Frédéric St-Laurent B (game director), and Mike Laidlaw (chief creative officer). The team has offices in both Montreal and Quebec City and currently consists of 68 employees. The studio was founded to foster a \"people first\" work culture where employees' wellness takes priority while also focusing on developing titles featuring, according to their website, \"deeply interactive spaces where player creativity can shine.\"\n\"We are thrilled to share this exciting news with our community. Self-publishing is a leap of faith, especially in the current turbulent industry climate, but it’s also an opportunity to take our destiny into our own hands and reach out directly to players and the wider gaming community during this release.” says Mike Laidlaw, in a press release\"Our team has been hard at work for years, and we can’t wait to showcase our debut project to the world. It’s a huge milestone for us, and we see it as just the first step on what we hope will be a long and rewarding journey for the company, charting our own path, and growing our talents and products brick by brick.”",

Knowing of the Ardognus prophecy, created by the powerful high priest Hahmid III, you must find and destroy the hidden shrine devoted to Ra before the eclipse occurs.\nEmbark on this exciting journey packed with a trusty gun for blasting through doors or dispatching undead mummies; a compass to guide you through a treacherous pyramid; a wristwatch to track the precious time left; and a water bottle to fight dehydration (you’re only human after all). \nCan you solve this ancient mystery within 120 minutes and avert catastrophe, or will Rah's wrath obliterate the moon?\nOur modern reimplementation of the Freescape engine features graphics using hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Total Eclipse support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum, and Amstrad CPC. More releases are coming at a later date. Additionally, there are three playable demos if you want to test the game. Please contact us if you have some other release or demo.\nTo play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.\n>",

          "description": "I was once the hottest new model on the street. Newspapers heralded my arrival in every town. The titans of industry were inspired to produce more goods when I visited their factories. But as the years have passed, so do their eyes pass over me, to eye curiously my replacements. Will you try the new style, ma’am? It’s so much better than that old thing. I’ve watched my friends grow old and die. My brother got caught in traffic and caused a horrific level crossing collision. I get sick more often, wheezing to a halt wherever I am. When I visit the doctor for a spot of renewal, they tell me, “Sorry, I can’t help. You’re too old.” When will I be autoreplaced? Woe is the tale of the Balogh Goods Truck. But what if we could slow or pause the steady march of time? In OpenTTD 14, you can.",
