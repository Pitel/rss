Being able to manipulate gravity throughout an entire game, though? That's a pretty new one (shush, Gravity Rush and VVVVVV fans), but if our hands-on time with the demo for Reggie: The Game is anything to go by, then we're in for a treat when it eventually launches in 2025.\nTo use its full name, Reggie, His Cousin, Two Scientists and Most Likely the End of the World is a 2D platformer from Dutch developer Degoma in which you navigate stages by flipping the world's gravity, effectively allowing you to zip to the ceiling and back down again, or even zig-zag in mid-air, bopping enemies on the head (or their backsides) as you go. It's pretty similar to VVVVVV in some respects, but the ability to flip the gravity while mid-air and utilise physics to manipulate your momentum sets this one apart quite nicely.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Surprises like Doom (2016), which turned up in the system's launch year, and 2019's Witcher 3 showed that while clever optimisation was required, Nintendo's console could deliver perfectly playable and utterly absorbing portable versions of some of the biggest video games around.\nAs time wore on and Sony and Microsoft's next-gen platforms launched, the Switch ports kept coming — the excellent Pentiment has been a particular highlight this year. We've got our fingers crossed for Ace Combat 7 and Stray, although recent disappointments such as the Batman Arkham Trilogy show that caution is warranted. The Switch is in its eighth year, and the tech within was hardly bleeding edge in 2017.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "A ribbiting new adventure.\nThough the heyday of the 3D platformer is long past, modern indie developers have done a pretty good job of keeping the spirit alive through dedicated efforts in titles such as Lunistice, Mail Mole, Cavern of Dreams, and Demon Turf. Frogun was another decent new entry to the genre back in 2022 and now the developers at Top Hat Studios have come back for a second outing with Frogun Encore, a “standalone expansion/sequel” that carries on and polishes up much of what made the original a hidden gem. Frogun Encore may still be a little janky in places (arguably that’s part of the charm), but Renata’s sophomore outing is overall a stronger and more enjoyable adventure that fans of retro 3D platformers will want to watch out for.\nFrogun Encore plays much the same as its predecessor, tasking you with exploring brief levels packed with secrets, enemies, and a whole lot of collectibles. Renata herself is a little more limber than in her initial outing, as she can now pull off moves like a double jump or a mid-grapple catapult maneuver. And just like last time, she can use her trusty frogun (which can, adorably, talk to her and give advice throughout levels) to zip to distant ledges and snatch jars or enemies up with its lengthy tongue. The girl and frog duo may have a rather simplistic moveset compared to 3D platformer royalty like Banjo and Kazooie, but the levels here are well-tailored to their abilities and routinely come up with interesting new challenges to keep you on your toes.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

But most of us wouldn't know it. Making its debut in 1987 on the Famicom, it wouldn't be until the Virtual Boy that Nintendo gamers (well, a few of them) would find out about the demon-summoning series. And now, the series boasts multiple sub-series, revivals, remakes, and enhanced editions. It's a pretty big hole to dive down.\nSince gaining popularity in the West — thanks to Shin Megami Tensei III and Persona 3 on the PS2 — Atlus' star has only risen, with the latter sub-series becoming its own beast. But in terms of the more traditional, hardcore, and games you can get in the West, what is the best Shin Megami Tensei game?\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Dawn of a new day.\nTo someone who isn’t an avid fan, the Legend of Heroes series can seem a little difficult to break into. The dozen or so games released over the past two decades are spread across four distinct arcs that all collectively built out one of the most detailed and tightly interconnected universes in all of gaming, one which is still slowly building towards an epic conclusion. Yet, with this new release of The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak, it’s never been a better time to give these games a shot. Trails Through Daybreak is a fresh start for the series in more ways than one, offering an experience that will appeal to fans both new and old.\nTrails Through Daybreak is set in the Republic of Calvard, an economically dominant state with a level of technological advancement that rivals the modern real world, and begins by introducing us to Van Arkride, a local ‘Spriggan’. Van’s role is as a sort of private investigator who takes shady jobs that the local law enforcement won’t cover themselves, but business for him seems to be going a little slow as he’s woken up from a nice nap in his office by a schoolgirl named Agnes Claudel.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Besides giving The First Descendant the ol’ benchy marks on desktop, I was curious to see how this gleaming looter shooter would run on the less flexing hardware of the Steam Deck. The answer: it didn’t, at first. Luckily, a semi-quick fix was enough to get me in, where I found a game that for all its ray tracing inclinations, is comfortable with life on the Deck. Reasonably. Most of the time.\nWith any luck, my issue could be purged completely by the time The First Descendant releases on July 2nd. Partly because I was using a technically non-final preview build, and partly because the problem itself was a silly one: launching was blocked by a case of missing Visual C++, something that the Steam Deck’s Proton compatibility witchcraft usually takes care of. Come on, Proton lad, you’re kinda dropping the ball here.\nIf this ever happens to you, in The First Descendant or any other game, I heartily recommend YouTuber JD Ros’ video tutorial on fixing it. The method boils down to installing the latest C++ versions via the Steam Deck’s Desktop Mode, then adding their executables to the game’s launch options.

          "description": "I don’t dislike The First Descendant. It has a good grasp of the numbers-go-up-yay appeal behind looter shooters. Sometimes you get to grapple onto a vast robot crab. The first evil alien overlord you fight is named Greg. Not bad, not bad. It’s also, wholeheartedly and unapologetically, a big graphical show-off, complete with multiple ray tracing modes and shinier power armour than if you fed the entire cast of Warframe through an industrial car wash.\nHappily, this doesn’t necessarily translate into chugging performance on low-end PCs, or even handhelds like the Steam Deck. But judging from its final preview version, which has just closed prior to the July 2nd release date, feasting on The First Descendant’s finest visuals will definitely tax your rig – and it has its share of technical quirks on the side.\nRead more",

There's networked communications tech, but it consists of signals between bodies in deepest space, light years apart, of lonely video terminals in cramped dockloader apartments, and of maniacally collaged CCTV feeds of Marines getting their asses kicked, man. There's no ocean of online interactions, corroding the everyday from all directions, just 1-to-1s through boxy, retro-futurist screens that are so dingy and inadequate it feels like Ripley and Burke are peering at each other through a letterbox. Small wonder, given that Aliens was released in 1986, when what would become the internet was still mostly the province of universities and the military. \r\n \nRead more",

The downside there, as a few people have pointed out, is that some players don't want to hunt for collectibles before they can topple the bosses.\n Read more",

I am morbidly curious about them, although I cannot ascertain their texture just by looking, which worries me. A Khorne dog, however, is a texturally simpler proposition. You can tell just by looking at today’s new legendary hero for strategy game Total War Warhammer 3 that he’d be quite difficult to chew, should you get to that point. Either way, the price is definitely easy to swallow - he’s completely free as part of today’s patch 5.1.0, which also brings substantial changes to multiplayer.\n \nRead more",

Apparently some Steam Deck players are seeing an \"Innapropriate activity detected\" message upon launching Elden Ring, blocking them from playing online. I haven't had this myself, and some have reported the issue fixing itself after they installed the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, but hopefully there's a proper patch in the works.\nElden Ring on the Steam Deck has long enjoyed a smoothness that desktop play has lacked. Not so much in simple framerate terms – the handheld spends far more time around the 30fps mark than it does bumping into Elden Ring’s 60fps cap – but thanks to a Proton compatibility update back in 2022, it’s drastically less prone to the flow-breaking stutter that still plagues the RPG in 2024. That now goes for Shadow Of The Erdtree as well, judging from my portable time in the new expansion.\nRead more",

It's also, according to several former employees of Chorus developers Fishlabs in Hamburg, an internal title for the massive cost-cutting project begun by Swedish conglomerate Embracer Group in June 2023.\nThe current incarnation of a bewildering series of mergers, renamings and acquisitions that date back to the founding of Nordic Games in 2004, Embracer have spent much of the past decade buying up video game studios and licenses, from Deus Ex developers Eidos Montreal to the adaptation rights for The Lords Of The Rings. According to a February 2023 earnings report, by the end of December 2022 the conglomerate had 134 internal studios on the books (including table-top developers) and owned or controlled over 850 IPs, with 224 games in development. Our Graham warned of the perils of such consolidation in 2019, and his misgivings have been borne out. Following the reported collapse of a billion dollar Savvy Games investment deal, Embracer set out to recover their debts by cancelling projects, laying off staff and closing whole studios. Fishlabs - acquired by Embracer in 2018 alongside their parent company Koch Media, nowadays Plaion - were among those burned by \"Project Phoenix\", first losing a dozen people in September 2023, and then around half their remaining workforce in November. In the process of these reductions, Embracer also binned off two video game projects – a sumptuous sci-fi metroidvania that was in full development, and a \"visual prototype\" for a brand new Red Faction game.\n  \nRead more",

Early footage painted the portrait of a spirited 3D hack-and-slasher featuring much buckling of swashes, heaving of hos and jollying of rogers.\nJim Rossignol (RPS in peace) was cautiously enthused when he played Captain Blood in 2008. \"It was actually pretty fun - especially the arcade boat violence between speedy galleons - but I'm not exactly holding out for a masterpiece,\" he wrote. Alas, Captain Blood's ship struck a reef in the shape of unspecified publishing disputes, and sank beneath the waves after one last defiant preview showing in 2010. Now, the game has risen from the depths Flying Dutchman-style thanks to new developers Seawolf Studio and General Arcade and publisher SNEG Ltd.

          "description": "You might have noticed that the second most played game on Steam right now is Banana, which released back in April, but has seen an explosion of popularity over the past couple of weeks. What is Banana? It's a free idle clicker in which you click on a picture of a banana to make numbers go up. If the number goes up enough, the game drops additional pictures of bananas into your Steam inventory. Actually, it's not even an idle clicker - simply leaving the game open all day is enough to generate a slow but steady supply of these banana pictures. \r\n \nRead more",

The punishing roguelite trappings of Dead Cells? 2D Souls-nuzzling Salt and Sacrifice? I wouldn’t know, because I’ve always had such trouble with slashing, blocking, and jumping in two dimensions that not only have I barely played any of the above, I’ve missed out a swathe of important platformers in the belief I just didn’t have it in me to manage them. But Nine Sols is so generous, so creative, so lucid and upfront in its ruleset, even as it crushes you with sometimes absurd difficulty, that playing it has opened up an entire library of classics I might have otherwise missed out on. I don’t have the experience to tell you what this game does better than others of its ilk, but I can tell how it made me feel. And for a game that murdered me with such relentless frequency, Nine Sols made me feel invincible.\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Prázdniny začínají a nebastlíři leží na plážích nebo se vystavují nebezpečnému UV záření mimo kontrolované prostředí laboratoře. Strahováci však stále sledují, co se děje nového ve světě techniky a v pondělí se novinkám na Virtuální Bastlírně podívají na zoubek.\r\n\r\nAltium změnilo licenční model, což způsobilo vlnu nevole. KiCADu v posledních verzích postupně přibývá podpora importu z Altia - nahrálo Altium nechtěně do karet KiCADu? Co ale ze světa hardwaru?\r\n\r\nLilyGO začíná prodávat levné \"chytré\" brýle s ESP32. Z Číny se dají kooupit procesory s BT 5.0 pod dolar. Vznikla open-source aktivní sonda do 2 GHz - zmíní i jak se dělají kabely k osciloskopickým sondám. Nedávno také bastlíři vyzkoušeli Faradayův jev v oleji a mají i video. Nesmí ale zapomínat i na software.\r\n\r\nKromě nové verze KiCADu si můžeme ukázat drobné zlepšováky pro LTSpice - import bloků s S-parametry nebo export schémat do pěkné prezentovatelné podoby. Nově vznikl i fork AR488 podporující ethernet místo USB připojení. Nezapomínají však ani na naše oblíbená úsměvná až bizarní témata!\r\n\r\nZměna licence zřejmě konečně po 20+ letech umožnila Altiu zprovoznit podporu pro jednovrstvé plošné spoje. Adam H. na dovolené hackuje RFID zámky (ale o tom více poví osobně až někdy příště). Na zubních kartáčcích s ESP32 se šíří botnet. Vzniká český vesmírný program (bohužel se nejmenuje Kosmo) a vznikla podpora pro psaní programů v .NETu na prehistorickou konzoli NES/Famicom.\r\n\r\nJak vidíte, seznam zajímavých témat na tento měsíc je vskutku obsáhlý. Neváhejte tedy, nažhavte svoje počítače, repráky, mikrofony a kamery a připojte se s námi na Virtuální Bastlírnu XL. Nejde však o velikost, jen o pořadové číslo 40 - VB je tu pro všechny nezávisle na velikosti, věku či čemkoliv jiném.\r\n\r\nPříští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat v pondělí 1. července od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.",

          "description": "There are a lot of mounts in Final Fantasy XIV, and some command more envy than others. One mount, added in Dawntrail, is the Air-Wheeler A-9. This ultra-realistic motorbike is sleek and sure to catch anyone’s attention. \n\n\nThe Air-Wheeler A-9 also transforms, which was something mentioned by director Naoki Yoshida during the Live Letter from the Producer 82, shortly before the release of Dawntrail. When you take flight on the Air-Wheeler A9, the wheels flip outwards, turning the bike into something akin to an oversized drone.\n\n\nHowever, in order to get this mount, you’ve got a lot of Dawntrail to get through. The Air-Wheeler A-9 will only become available to purchase once you’ve reached Solution Nine, which unlocks at level 96 after completing a dungeon called Vanguard. \n\n\nWhere to purchase the Air Wheeler A-9 in Final Fantasy XIV\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nIf you want to purchase the Air-Wheeler A-9, you have two choices, and neither of them is cheap. \n\n\nYou could, of course, purchase the Air-Wheeler A-9 Identification Key on the Marketboard, but the price is likely to be incredibly high, especially this early into the release of Dawntrail and the already high purchase price from the ‘official’ vendor. \n\n\nOtherwise, you’ll need to head to Solution Nine and then make your way to the Nexus Arcade. This is the shopping area of Solution Nine, and here you’ll find the Air-Wheeler Dealer (X:8.4, Y:13.3). \n\n\nIf you’ve got 7.5 million Gil, he’ll be more than happy to take it off your hands in exchange for the Air-Wheeler A-9 mount. This is currently the only item that he sells, but there’s no telling what may be added to his stock in future patches. \n\nThe post How to get the Air Wheeler A-9 mount in FFXIV Dawntrail appeared first on Destructoid.",

This problem might occur in cities and outside areas, and Yoshida claims the likely cause is memory fragmentation.\n\n\nYoshida says the team is actively looking to fix the problem, and will be releasing a patch as soon as possible. Still, due to the rigorous examination it requires, this might take some time.\n\n\nYoshida goes on to apologize for the situation, and says that less-densely populated Worlds are less likely to feature this issue. He recommends that, for the time being, you play on the Dynamis, Shadow, or Oceania data centers.\n\n\nFreezing mechanics not working properly in some areas\n\n\nYoshida explains that in Dragonsong’s Reprise (Ultimate), the Minstrel’s Ballad: Shinryu’s Domain, and Delubrum Reginae (Savage), some freezing mechanics might not be working properly. He assures players that the team is working on a fix that will come with an upcoming patch.\n\n\nPoor display and animations of certain characters\n\n\n The team has identified an issue plaguing some races when they try to display certain emotes and Seraphism, the scholar action. The team attributes this issue to the input of incorrect values, which likely stem from the new graphical update.\n\n\nYoshida then goes on to apologize for every aforementioned problem, and expressed his desire to release a hotfix this week.\n\n\nYou can now experience Dawntrail's Early Access on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. The official release is set for July 2.\n\nThe post Yoshi P Apologizes for Final Fantasy XIV Dawntrail’s Issues appeared first on Destructoid.",

A drop in player count is to be expected for any online game at some point after launch, but from what I've seen, the smaller player base hasn't hurt how much fun this game is to play. \n\n\nAt its highest peak on Steam, Helldivers 2 had 458,709 players all online fighting for Super Earth at once.

Some Redditers are shocked by this revelation. Mallengar compares it to a \"gilded cage,\" saying, \"I can sort of understand why they can't go back mechanically because of reasons; but for it to be this in the in-game lore is kind of horrifying if you think about it.\" \n\n\nAnother user atruepear compared the concept of Disney Dreamlight Valley to Coraline, a book/film in which a child gets stuck in an alternate dimension and has trouble leaving her horrific new home.\n\n\nIn past sections of the story, it was revealed that the valley is a machination of your dream, and those who forgot this world are returning, remembering past adventures with your protagonist.  The story's deeper than you might think for a game like this.\n\n\nThese Disney characters aren't from the films, they're part of your imagination.

Developer A44 (Ashen) has also released the game’s PC specs and 20-minutes of raw gameplay footage.\nThe upcoming \"Souls-lite\" fantasy action game stars elite soldier Nor Vanek and her furry fox-like companion Enki on a revenge quest to kill the gods of their world.

Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days.

As for why, the team wants to give its spiritual cousin, Life Is Strange: Double Exposure, some space to shine later this year. \nLost Records was originally due out in late 2024, which is also when the next Life is Strange is set to launch. Instead of competing with Life Is Strange, a series that Don't Nod created with the first Life Is Strange and continued with Life Is Strange 2 before Double Exposure developer Deck Nine took over with 2017's Before the Storm and 2021's True Colors, the studio decided to push to 2025. \nWe've made the decision to move the release dates of Lost Records: Bloom & Rage to early 2025. We know you're all excited for both Lost Records and the new Life is Strange game, and we wanted to ensure both have adequate space to shine. The wait will be worth it! pic.twitter.com/PH1O7z3uUy\nJune 28, 2024\nLife Is Strange: Double Exposure launches October 29, and now, Lost Records: Bloom & Rage, which will be released in two parts, will launch sometime early next year.

Despite my expectations, I was not prepared for how robust it actually is in Veilguard. Robust enough, even, that BioWare used it to create most of the NPCs in the game, save for mainline characters like companions. Setting hyperbole aside, it is a staggeringly rich creation system, and I look forward to seeing player-created near-replicas of celebrities and monstrous creations that'd be more at home in a horror game. \nBut I'm also looking forward to the community's reaction to the Dragon Age series' best character creator yet.

Originally slated to launch next month on July 25, the upcoming narrative-driven city-builder is now arriving on September 20.\nDeveloper 11 Bit Studios sates that following a recent beta, the team wants to take extra time addressing feedback to ensure the best possible experience. In a press release, design director Jakub Stokalski and art director Lukasz Juszczyk issued the following statement:\n“Based on the surveys we received after playing Beta, the average rating you gave us was 8 out of 10. We’re super grateful for that! At the same time, it was only a small slice of a work-in-progress, still-growing game. While our backlog is plentiful, it was an opportunity for us to listen to what you enjoyed, and what didn’t quite land yet”. \n“This allowed us to prioritise things better, and bring upfront the features and modifications we were already working on. But we also realised that to guarantee the best possible experience on launch, we need more time to finish the development of Frostpunk 2. That’s why we made the difficult decision to postpone its release to September 20th, 2024”.\n11 Bit States that it plans to work on new additions to existing game mechanics and improve the UI and UX, among other things. \nFrostpunk 2 will launch first for PC on September 20. PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions are planned to arrive later. We recently played the game, and you can read our extensive preview here.",

          "description": "Developer Aspyr Media and publisher Lucasfilm Games have revealed that an enhanced edition of 2002's Star Wars: Bounty Hunter will launch on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC this August. More specifically, it hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via Steam) on August 1, and it brings with it updated visuals and controls and a new skin that harkens back to the original game's most infamous easter egg. \nIn the reveal trailer, we get a look at the graphical improvements Aspyr has implemented in Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, but the game still retains that 2002 PlayStation 2 and GameCube charm. This re-release follows a limited PlayStation 4 physical run that launched back in 2019. \nCheck out the Star Wars: Bounty Hunter announcement trailer below: \n\n\nIf you're unfamiliar with Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, you play as Jango Fett throughout the story, which itself is a prequel to Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones. \nIn the original game, there was an easter egg message that said, \"Cash in all bounties to play as Boba.\" However, cashing in all bounties did not let you play as Boba. To make good on that original promise from 2002, Aspyr media has included a Boba Fett skin in Star Wars: Bounty Hunters you can use after completing the game's campaign. \nStar Wars: Bounty Hunter hits PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on August 1. \nWhile waiting for its launch, check out this lengthy gameplay demo of Star Wars Outlaws, another mercenary-centric Star Wars game launching this year.

Though the once previously Xbox-exclusive game has since made its way to PlayStation and PC platforms, it remains unclear which platforms this remaster is coming to. And there's no word on when to expect the remaster either. \nRevealed with a short 47-second teaser trailer, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster looks great, almost more like a remake than a remaster. It's unclear if this is a remaster of the original 2006 game or the HD version of Dead Rising that launched on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC back in 2017. Regardless, we're stoked to head back into a zombie-infested mall with journalist Frank West whenever this remaster launches. \nCheck out the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster teaser trailer for yourself below: \n\n\n\nAre you excited for Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster?

          "description": "The one and only Elden Ring expansion we're getting, Shadow of the Erdtree, launched last week and thousands of Tarnished went to the shadow realm to take on dozens of new enemies, bosses, and more. Now, just a few days later, developer From Software has released a new patch for the game that should make Shadow of the Erdtree a bit easier. \nNow live, Calibration Update 1.12.2 targets the scaling of the attack and damage negation given to players with each Shadow Realm Blessing upgrade. Here's what's changed: \nThe attack and damage negation has been increased for the first half of the maximum amount of Blessing enhancements, and the second half will now be more gradual. \nThe attack and damage negation granted by the final level of Blessing enhancements has been slightly increased. \n\n\nThis patch should apply automatically like any other Elden Ring update but if it doesn't – the Calibration Version listed at the bottom right reads \"1.12.2\" if it has – select \"LOGIN\" and that will apply the latest version of the game. \nThe only other thing this update contains is word from From Software on a confirmed bug where the raytracing settings of Shadow of the Erdtree are automatically enabled (if you've previously loaded save data from previous game versions), which is causing framerate issues for some players. If you're encountering said issues, check to see if you have raytracing on or off in the game's system graphical settings. \nThis patch arrives after one that hit the game last week, which added new hairtsyles, inventory features, balance adjustments, and more to Elden Ring ahead of Shadow of the Erdtree's launch. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree review, and then check out this interview where From Software's Hidetaka Miyazaki discusses his approach to difficulty in games. \nWhat do you think of this update?

At best, studios reimagine classic experiences in exciting new ways, sand away rough edges, and somehow retain the intangible x-factors that made fans fall in love with these titles in the first place. At the very least, remakes offer a great way to play antiquated or less accessible experiences on modern hardware. \nThe remake boom has been in full swing in recent years to the point that it’s starting to get tough to keep track of all the projects in the works.

It's currently in a testing phase, but if you own the PlayStation 4 version of the game for your PS5, you can take part in the preview right now. \nThough Minecraft has been playable on PS5 for years, it's always been the PS4 version; this native version, however, is a new build of Minecraft made specifically for PS5, which means it will theoretically perform better on the console. \n\n\n\"Currently, however, the only way to play Minecraft on a PlayStation 5 is by purchasing the PlayStation 4 version of the game,\" the announcement reads. \"By developing a native version of Minecraft for PS5, we'll be able to make the game run more effectively on the PS5's hardware.\" \nThough Mojang hasn't revealed how long the Minecraft PS5 version preview will last, all are welcome to take part in it, so long as they own the PS4 version of the game. To access it, go to \"Settings\" on your PS4 version of Minecraft while playing on a PS5 and select \"Preview.\" This preview includes the new Tricky Trials update, so you can venture into the trial chambers, meet a breeze, craft a mace, and more. \nMojang asks that players who encounter bugs during this preview report it to the developer, and more generally, provide any feedback they might have. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Minecraft review, and then check out this story about how actor Jack Black has all but confirmed he's playing Steve in the upcoming live-action Minecraft movie.

From Dragon Age: Origins' real-time strategy RPG approach to Dragon Age II's mostly-set-within-one-city action experience to Dragon Age: Inquisition's strategy-action mix, BioWare hasn't quite defined the franchise's combat. However, a through-line is apparent from Origins to Inquisition: BioWare seemingly wants this franchise to be action but has attempted to shift to that without abandoning its longtime fans. \nWith Dragon Age: The Veilguard, BioWare has completed its transition from strategy to real-time action, but thanks to an optional tactical pause-and-play combat wheel that harkens back to the series' origins, I feel it's found a great (battle)ground …",

But something about that game has stuck with players. In addition to resonating with a wider audience than many of From Software's most iconic titles to that point, Bloodborne delivered an engrossing world full of mystery and challenge, causing it to remain top-of-mind for many Soulslike fans even today. In the lead-up to the launch of Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree, I sat down with the creator of Elden Ring, Dark Souls, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, Demon's Souls, and Bloodborne to learn why the 2015 PS4 exclusive holds as special a place in his heart as it does the game's many fans.\nFor Miyaz…",

While the initial offerings lacked depth and sometimes left us craving more than the base game was able to deliver, Nintendo has stuck with the title and has improved the offerings through free updates. A few months after launch, the title added golf at no additional charge, and during today's Nintendo Direct, we learned that another free update is coming to the game this summer to add basketball to the mix.\nNintendo Switch Sports' implementation of basketball uses motion controls to dribble, pass, and shoot. You can participate in two-on-two matches locally, or compete in Five-Streak Battle matches and Three-Point Contests. You can also take part in a solo Three-Point Challenge, where you need to make as many baskets as you can before time expires.\nNintendo Switch Sports' basketball free update arrives this summer. For more on Nintendo Switch Sports, be sure to read our review of the base game here.",

With many of the most classic titles already on Nintendo Switch Online's various catalogs, the output has decreased significantly. However, during today's Nintendo Direct, four of the most requested games were announced for release today.\nMetroid: Zero Mission, the excellent Game Boy Advance remake of the original Metroid, and The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Four Swords, the Game Boy Advance remake of the classic SNES title but with a separate co-op campaign, come to Nintendo Switch Online's Game Boy Advance catalog. On top of that, Nintendo announced the Nintendo 64 catalog is getting two M-rated entries: Perfect Dark, the GoldenEye 007 spiritual successor from developer Rare, and Turok: Dinosaur Hunter.\nAs a reminder, the NES, SNES, and Game Boy libraries are included in the base Nintendo Switch Online subscription, while Nintendo 64, Game Boy Advance, and Sega Genesis catalogs require you to upgrade to the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription. As such, to access all of the games announced and released today, you'll need to subscribe to that premium membership. The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Four Swords and Metroid: Zero Mission join the Game Boy Advance library today, while Perfect Dark and Turok: Dinosaur Hunter join the Nintendo 64 catalog today.",

          "description": "In recent years, Capcom has really shown its dedication to the Ace Attorney series by bringing the games to modern consoles. The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles brought two games to the West for the first time, while the Apollo Justice Ace Attorney Trilogy gave the newest games in the series a facelift. Today, with the announcement of Ace Attorney Investigations Collection, Capcom is not just bringing another Japan-only release to Western gamers, but it's also made the entire library of Ace Attorney games available on modern consoles.\n\n\nThe Investigations games follow Miles Edgeworth, an antagonist turned reluctant ally from the original trilogy of Phoenix Wright games. Instead of defending suspects in court, Edgeworth is a prosecutor, so it's up to him to build a case against the main suspects. By collecting evidence and completing logic puzzles, he and the lovable Detective Gumshoe solve mysteries and serve justice. While the first game launched in the States as a DS title, the second never officially made it over, so this is many players' first chance to see its story.\nLike other Ace Attorney collections, the Ace Attorney Investigations Collection will have a number of modes and settings for fans to appreciate the art and music of the original game. While it includes new \"hand-drawn character visuals\" for a more modern look, it also allows players to switch to classic pixel sprites if they prefer the look of the original. Meanwhile, the gallery includes character art, a photo album, and music from the game, including orchestral arrangements.\nWhile the announcement was made during the Nintendo Direct, Ace Attorney Investigations collection is far from a console exclusive – the two-game collection will launch on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on September 6.",

Super Mario Party Jamboree is a brand-new entry in the franchise, but it’s looking as if the general thrust of play remains mostly intact, with a few notable additions.\nThe reveal trailer shows Mario and friends descending on a small archipelago of islands that make up a massive resort. Across the many boards, players can encounter 110 different minigames.\nJamboree includes five new boards – Mega Wiggler’s Tree Party, King Bowser’s Keep, Roll ‘em Raceway, Goomba Lagoon, and Rainbow Galleria – plus returning boards from earlier games, including Mario’s Rainbow Castle (From Mario Party) and Western Land (from Mario Party 2). We got to see a bit of how the board games play out in a couple of these locales. Roll ‘em Raceway includes a turbo dice item that allows player Karts to zip forward up to 40 spaces with a good roll. In Goomba Lagoon, a changing tide adjusts the path across the board.\nThe most surprising addition is the new Koopathlon game mode, which allows up to 20 players to jump in together online. The early gameplay on offer here calls to mind other online party titles like Fall Guys.\nNintendo is touting Jamboree as the largest game in the series. We’ll see how true that is when the game launches for Switch on October 17.",

No, it’s not the key on your keyboard. Rather, it’s a detective story set on a distant planet. Important data has been stolen, and the perpetrator is a shape-shifter laying low in a spaceport dive bar until he can flee off-planet. You play a hard-boiled detective who has the skill to psychically visit bar patrons’ memories to gather clues and narrow down suspects.\nThis is thanks to the kind people at ZOOM Platform, who provided us with the original game sources to work with. Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game features a lot of options to chat around with bar patrons’ and do various actions in the different flashbacks. So we really need people to spend time experimenting and make sure everything works correctly. And please take some screenshots along the way.\nIf you don’t own The Space Bar, you can try one of the free demos or purchase it digitally from the ZOOM Platform. Testing is also available on Steam via a beta branch, check the Steam announcement for more details.\nNow, good luck, and fingers crossed you can find the perp. Otherwise, your bureau chief will have you getting up close and personal with toilet duties for the rest of your career. Oh, and PS: The viewpoints of different aliens differ. For the Bartender, who has segmented eyes, even the original developers felt it was difficult and left in a cheat key of ScrollLock to switch back to a single viewpoint. Feel free to use it if, at any point, the flashback becomes too much for you :)\n>",
