Or, Dragon Warrior as it was known in the west back in 1989.\nFerrisonNA (real name Christian Deitering) has been chronicling his journey to collect a huge number of copies of the NES RPG over on his website, The Unorthodox Dragon Warrior Collection. And a new update made earlier today (and shared on Twitter) revealed that the collector — who was the producer of the Mother To Earth: The Untold Story of Earth Bound documentary — has finally hit a milestone of one thousand copies.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Still going strong after 25 years in the industry, it maintains an incredibly strong foothold in both Taiwan and China, producing successful racing game series like Speed Driver, now on its fifth entry, and various light gun and redemption machines.\nIGS’s development of the Polygame Master (PGM) hardware in 1997, and its acquisition of the DoDonpachi license from shooting game Goliath, Cave, was significant. After seeing IGS’s DoDonpachi II: Bee Storm in 2001, Cave was not only convinced to stay in the market, but went on to license the PGM hardware to produce DoDonpachi DaiOuJou and Ketsui. This Switch collection is based on that hardware, ignoring the PGM2 and PGM3 that succeeded it.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Then, once he settled that the premise of the book — \"A high school student who summons demons because he is dissatisfied with the status quo\" — meant that the lead character shouldn't be written as a hero, Nishitani submitted the manuscript to the editors.

          "description": "Sticks and stones may break my bones, but chains and whips excite me.\nIt’s a shame that League of Legends has become such a meme for being a source of toxicity, as Riot Games has consistently shown that the world of Runeterra has quite a bit more potential than the MOBA lets on. Through its Riot Forge publishing arm, the company has enlisted several indie developers to make a diverse lineup of games spanning multiple genres to spotlight its lineup of champions, leading to the creation of great releases like Ruined King and Hextech Mayhem. Now, Digital Sun—the creators of Moonlighter—has been given a crack at the IP with The Mageseeker, and we’re pleased to report that it provides yet another deeply enjoyable take on the world of Runeterra.\nThe Mageseeker primarily follows characters in the nation of Demacia. Demacia is a prim, proud, and powerful kingdom that arose from the ashes of a global magical war, but that war led to a deep-rooted hatred and fear for all things magic. Out of this fear, the aristocracy formed the Mageseekers, a secret police organization designed to systematically hunt down all natural-born mages within the kingdom and either imprison or kill them.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

I wanted to see how well that smoothness and stability would carry over to the Steam Deck, and although the long-delayed zombie mulcher needs some cuts to quality settings, finding the right balance will have Dead Island 2 running almost as comfortably as the very best Steam Deck games.\nAlas, it’s still not the ideal handheld game, thanks both to the odd crash (lowering settings helps with this) and the fact that it needs some tinkering with the Epic Games Launcher to get it playable in the first place. Still, playable it very much is.\nLet’s start by addressing Dead Island 2’s lack of a Steam version; it launches on February 21st as an Epic Games exclusive, and since DI2 isn’t even listed on Steam right now, that’s unlikely to change any time soon. Luckily, there are workarounds: you can either install the Heroic Launcher, or follow our handy guide on how to install the Epic Games Launcher on the Steam Deck. Both of these should allow you to get Dead Island 2 downloaded onto the handheld, still using your regular Epic account.\n Read more",

It's about a small, cosy café where customers can travel back in time by sitting in a very particular chair, for the length of time it takes for a cup of coffee to go cold. It's not long by any means, but it affords its cast of regulars the chance to get some closure on an issue that's often been plaguing them throughout their lives. It's heart-warming, soppy stuff, but very feel-good. That January was also about the same time I slurped up every last episode of Midnight Diner on Netflix, where a chill Japanese man known only as The Master serves up delicious looking dishes in a tiny, 10-person izakaya from midnight onwards. Put these two things together, and it's probably no surprise that I liked the original Coffee Talk more than most.\nCoffee Talk Episode 2: Hibiscus & Butterfly is a continuation of that story, set three years later in the same, alternate version of Seattle where elves, werewolves, orcs, mermaids and other fantastical creatures all rub shoulders as city-dwelling citizens in need of a good cuppa. Once again, you play as the owner of the titular late-night coffee shop, brewing up a multitude of exotic hot drinks that you'll need to match to each customer's request that night as they tell you their woes. \nRead more",

          "description": "In the world of turn-based strategy games, it's probably fair to say that we've been waiting a heck of a long time for Jagged Alliance to make its next move. Almost a quarter of a century has passed since the last numbered entry in the series, and the many attempts that have been made to recapture its tactical, mercenary magic since then have been mixed at best, and reviled at worst. Haemimont Games, the devs behind Tropico and current custodians of the upcoming Jagged Alliance 3, know this, and their publisher THQ Nordic said as much back in September 2021 when it was first revealed, assuring players they were going to create a game that \"really does justice to the Jagged Alliance legacy\".  \nBut in an era where turn-based tactics games are now increasingly defined by genre titans such as XCOM and Into The Breach, I'm not sure that legacy means all that much anymore. I've been playing a substantial early chunk of Jagged Alliance 3 over the last week or so, and its decision to pare back crucial information such as chance-to-hit and other modern conveniences has mostly left me feeling frustrated and annoyed rather than daring and excited. The writing also made me cringe so hard at times I think even the neighbours heard my groans of despair. It certainly looks the part of a modern strategy game, its detailed African landscape, top down perspective and interactive objects calling to mind Mimimi's excellent Desperados 3 and Shadow Tactics games, but the rest feels like it's been lifted straight out of the late 90s where we last left Jagged Alliance 2 - and not necessarily to its benefit.\nRead more",

If George Romero had taken over a decade to make Night Of The Living Dead, the fact it takes place largely in a basement would look less like canny guerrilla filmmaking and more like staggering incompetence. It only took NASA eight years to put men on the moon from the point they started trying, which puts the value of many inhibited projects (like my folder of unfinished novels) into depressingly sharp relief.\r\n\n\r\nDead Island 2 does not put zombies on the moon, though given how daft the main game is, don't rule out a Dead Island 2: Moon's Haunted expansion shambling your way in late 2023. Yet that doesn't mean it's a bad game. In fact, it's quite an enjoyable one. Together, Deep Silver and Dambuster Studios have raised a moderately entertaining sequel to Techland's ye olde zombie survival sim, one that injects some life into its desiccated subject matter by being incredibly shiny, wilfully silly, spectacularly gory, and generally a touch more imaginative than I expected.\r\n\n \nRead more",

A crashing issue with LLife is Strange Remastered Collection has also been nixxed, as has a bug that for some reason forced open the Deck’s onscreen keyboard when launching A Plague Tale: Innocence and A Plague Tale: Requiem. Most of the other addressed problems don’t look as funny in my head, but you can read them all in the full patch notes regardless.\nDownloading Proton 8.0 onto the Steam Deck is easy enough: just search for it in your Library, tap or select the icon when it appears in the results, hit Install, and restart when it’s done.

          "description": "When The Witcher Remake devs Fool's Theory and 11 bit studios announced their new RPG The Thaumaturge at the very end of February, I'll admit that the premise didn't immediately grab me. The announcement trailer was little more than an enigmatic pan through the streets of historic Warsaw, and its climactic reveal of a shadowy man performing some Naruto finger magic to conjure a Soulsian monster from the gloom made it seem like yet another supernatural yarn in the vein of Frogwares' The Sinking City and Cyanide's Call Of Cthulhu. The gameplay trailer (embedded below) that followed a few days later revealed a teeny glimmer of what its monster fights actually look like in the flesh, but I still wasn't quite convinced this supernatural tale of demon tamers and interdimensional rifts would end up doing enough to make it stand out. \nBut actually clapping eyes on it in person at GDC? The Thaumaturge had my full attention. Set in Warsaw in 1905 - a period where Poland didn't exist on any real-life map due to it being under occupation by Russia, Germany and Austria at the time - this dark fantasy RPG sees its titular paranormal 'miracle worker' delve deep into the city's political tensions, conducting isometric detective investigations that pull from Fool's Theory's support work on Larian's Divinity: Original Sin games, while also engaging in striking turn-based battles to root out the corruption plaguing its citizens. Plus, with its hard lean into Slavic, rather than Lovecraftian, folklore for its ungodly ghoulies, The Thaumaturge has shot right to the top of my 'keep an eye on this maybe surprise hit' list. \nRead more",

Where other games use the mentally unwell narrator to explain everything away with \"turns out you're secretly crazy\", it's instead just one layer of a complex horror mystery with splashes of drama and noir, whose surprises I'm straining not to spoil.\r\n\n \nRead more",

You've probably heard the horror stories, or at least, got the general gist that success in Japanese business often equates to time. You don't necessarily need to be doing work, you just need to be present as the clock hands shift. A hard worker is reduced to a statue that only springs to life again when their boss gets up to leave.\nMr. Saitou is a short pixel art RPG that offers a hilarious commentary on the absurdities of working culture in Japan, with occasional flashes of seriousness.

They'll zomble their way up the main path, and with their high health pools they'll cut into the vast piglin forces and buy me time. With another flourish a contingent of friendly creepers scuttles along behind me. I lead them on a flanking attack around the outpost, targeting their spawners while the main piglin army is occupied with my frontal assault. A masterpiece of tactical engineering!\nOr it would have been, if my minions weren't so bloody stupid. Half my zombies fell off the staircase they were climbing due to their terrible pathfinding, and burned up in the lava moat below. Meanwhile, I sent my creepers off to explode against the first spawner I found. Only one of them got there; the others relentlessly humped a wall they could easily have climbed, until Piglins surrounded and slaughtered them. I returned to my starting point with what remained of my army, a fair bit poorer in resources, and a great deal poorer in patience.\nWelcome to Minecraft Legends, a strange mixture of real-time strategy and open-world adventure which frustrates and impresses in equal measure. There's half a great game lurking here, but it's marred by inadequacies that have nibbled away at me like piglins at my walls. This game could have been so much more.\nRead more",

I chatted to John Patrick Lowrie (The Sniper), Gary Schwartz (The Heavy, The Demoman), Robin Atkin Downes (The Medic) and Ellen McLain (The Administrator) about the game's fifteen year long legacy, the process of finding their character's voices as well as their favourite quotes. It was a riot of an interview and, to be honest, a bit of a career highlight. It also did really well on TikTok, which I have mixed feelings about.\r\n\nFifteen minutes after the gang left the grimy conference room in which the interview took place (I had immediately crawled onto the floor in an attempt to ease the anxiety from having conducted said interview), I got a Twitter notification. Robin had posted a video. Following our chat, the group had attempted to order a sandwich from a cafe in-character, leaving the staff completely bemused as a result. Understandably the video did numbers, and over the last six months, the gang have been releasing new episodes in what is now known as \"The Sandvich Saga\" on a regular basis.\nRead more",

Which is to remake the old Lovecraft-themed Sherlock Holmes game, but with new assets.\nIt's also got new puzzles and areas, and a slightly rewritten story to account for this being a sequel to Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One. It's a smaller, less ambitious game than Chapter One with some jank knocking around, and I wouldn't recommend it if you're not a fan of the series, but you know what?

So, The Tank he lived, and also died. Questing endlessly in this grimy medieval world won’t cut it. You’ll also need to keep your troupe paid and fed, so when evening fell to find nought but a handful of foraged mushrooms and a single mouldy apple I’d pried from the fingertips of a disemboweled bandit, it was time to get creative.\n“Waste not, want not”, said the Earl of Human Sandwich, the inventor of cannibalism (I’m told). With this in mind, I’d invested one of my early ‘Knowledge Points’ into a tech that let me repurpose my dearly departed as delicious drumsticks. Slain friendlies don’t disappear after battle. Instead, you’ll find their tastefully dressed corpses in the loot menu afterwards. Ghoulishly, the ‘loot all’ option doesn’t add their cadavers to your inventory with the rest.

They can run Minecraft servers, download stuff while you're away, let you practice programming, let your younger sibling play with or against you in retro or indie games. You might already have one lying around, in which case have a think about the possibilities - but if you'd like one and don't have one in a cupboard somewhere, you can grab a cheap Dell Latitude 7390 off Ebay for £219.99 in 'good' and 'refurbished' condition. For the money, you get an 8th-gen Core i5 processor with integrated graphics, a compact 13-inch design, 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. All in all, it's a pretty sweet spec for the asking price! \nRead more",

          "description": "That's a lot of babies\nElectronic Arts is celebrating the arrival of the 70 millionth player to The Sims 4. They’re attributing this to the recent Growing Together expansion, but I’m guessing it has more to do with the fact that The Sims 4 became free to play last October.\nI wouldn’t assume it’s specifically because of The Sims 4 Growing Together, because that expansion sounds like hell to me. It adds the infant stage of development, taking place between newborn and toddler. That’s all I want: more baby. Whenever my husband plays, he always makes these massive families, and for large swathes of time, all I hear is a cacophony of childhood tantrums next to me.\nOn the plus side, it does sound like a significant addition to the formula; it’s just one that makes me instinctively clench my jaw.\nI keep thinking that The Sims 4 is the only good thing that EA really does anymore. Then I remember that it has a bazillion expansions and DLC packs, with new ones dropping every month or so. Whoops, I nearly gave them some credit. I guess I’ll go back to pointing out that they have their own digital storefront, yet the original Sims title isn’t available, along with, like, 90% of Maxis' simulation franchise.\nIf I’m being honest, making the base Sims 4 free was a good move, especially if they want to sell more expansions. It’s like what my local drug dealers and gambling lords all agree on: the first hit is free. Once you’ve got them hooked, then you start sucking them dry.\nOn the other hand, I do think that The Sims 4 is an excellent title after you’ve dumped all your life’s savings into it. I'm not being facetious there; it is a good game. I think it's reasonable to like the game and hate the business model.\nThe post The Sims 4 has sucked in 70 million players appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The second \"server slam beta\" starts on May 12\nFolks were hoping for an announcement from the Diablo IV April 2023 developer update live stream: and they got it. There's going to be another beta for D4, and it starts on May 12, 2023.\nThe official Diablo Twitter account confirmed the news with a simple tweet:\n\"We've heard your feedback, it's time to visit Sanctuary once more before June. Join the Server Slam, May 12-14\"\n\nWhen is the second Diablo IV beta and what can you do in it?\nThat \"once more\"  and \"server slam\" bits tell us a few things. It seems, without further \"feedback\" in play, this is the final \"we promise\" beta period. The official launch is just weeks away on June 6, so there wouldn't be much time to prep and monitor another beta anyway. The phrase \"server slam\" also strongly hints that this is primarily a stress test to help the team calibrate for launch (crossed fingers this isn't D3 again).\nBlizzard subsequently tweeted out more info on this second public beta period, noting that you'll be able to reach level 20, beat Ashava, and earn the Cry of Ashava mount trophy. To think all this was teased earlier this week when that same Twitter account mysteriously alluded to another beta. Hopefully, once June 6 hits we don't all realize we're collectively in another beta: but based on how high folks have been riding on the pre-release of Diablo IV, this could be a much sleeker launch than D3.\nhttps://twitter.com/Diablo/status/1649125838095253538\nThe post Diablo 4 gets another open beta, encourages players to “slam the servers” appeared first on Destructoid.",

Today, the publisher announced it is acquiring Firewalk Studios.\nIn 2021, Sony had confirmed it was partnering with both Firewalk and ProbablyMonsters for its new, original multiplayer game. Today, PlayStation is expanding its partnership by bringing Firewalk under the PlayStation banner.\nHead of PlayStation Studios Hermen Hulst wrote the following in a PlayStation blog, announcing the move:\n\"Since announcing our publishing partnership with ProbablyMonsters and Firewalk in 2021, we continue to be impressed by the team’s ambitions to build a modern multiplayer game that connects players in new and innovative ways. The studio shares our passion for creating inspiring worlds grounded in exceptional gameplay, and we want to continue to invest in their mission. We’re excited for Firewalk to bring their technical and creative expertise to PlayStation Studios to help grow our live service operations and deliver something truly special for gamers.\"\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvXVA_ZLAWo\nFirewalk with Sony\nThere's not much info to go on, as to what Firewalk is actually working on. The studio was formed in 2018 as part of ProbablyMonsters, and is working on a AAA multiplayer game. It's got some industry veterans behind it, including former Bungie devs Tony Hsu and Ryan Ellis.

THQ Nordic will host a digital showcase on August 11, spotlighting plans for its upcoming lineup of games.\nThe stream will air live on THQ Nordic's channels over on YouTube, Twitch, and Steam. THQ Nordic's showcase will kick off at 12 p.m. PT / 3 p.m. ET on August 11, with HandyGames hosting a pre-show leading into the main event.\nhttps://twitter.com/THQNordic/status/1649035184917073922\nAs the announcement notes, THQ Nordic will be sharing info about both world premiere announcements and previously confirmed titles. Basically, games both new and known will appear here.\nTHQ Nordic has a few titles lined up already, including the newly remade Alone in the Dark, Outcast 2, racing-destruction game Wreckreation, and more. Heck, there was an unannounced, unrevealed title I played at PAX East that involved a crack squad of soldiers and some solid tactics. Here's hoping that's on the docket for this THQ Nordic showcase.\nAre you ready for the summer?\nThough it's coming in at the August end of the summer, I still think this puts THQ Nordic's showcase in the realm of \"summer games news.\" Traditionally, June is the month where games companies roll out a bevy of information about the rest of the year and even further on.\nBut especially after 2020 shifted everything online, that window has opened up a bit. And with no E3 to pin things down this year, the summer is looking like another one filled with developer and publisher showcases. We've got the Summer Game Fest kick-off in June, as well as streams from Xbox, Ubisoft, the PC Gaming Show, and more.\nThe post THQ Nordic is hosting a digital showcase in August appeared first on Destructoid.",

While Sports Story didn't deliver, the original is still perfectly preserved on the Switch eShop, and worth checking out. Like now, during its current sale for five bucks.\nIf you haven't played it yet, the summary does a pretty good job of getting the point across:\n\"Golf Story combines the sheer excitement of golf with a serious story that plays out over 8 different courses. Play the story of a golfer who is forced to give up all that he holds dear for one last shot at accomplishing his dreams. But all is not so simple in the world of golf. To best today's players you have to be able to keep up with them both on and off the course.\"\n\nThe marriage of unconventional retro sports genre flair and RPG elements really took to the gaming community at large and helped propel Sidebar Games into the limelight. Golf Story reinvented the retro sports genre in a way that felt natural, which helped cement it as a modern classic.\nSports Story didn't make nearly of a splash in the zeitgeist, but you can still get the original for five bucks on Switch if you want.

You might be thinking: well, we just got some Mystery Gifts! Well, you're right! You can read all about them here, but this one deals with two TMS.\nThanks to a new email distribution in Japan (cataloged by Twitter users like Makio & JRoses), we have another code: R0CKANDBAT0N.\nHere's what you get from the Scarlet & Violet R0CKANDBAT0N code:\nStealth Rock (TM116)\nBaton Pass (TM132)\nWell, it does what it says on the tin! One of the key advantages of taking free TMs via the Mystery Gift system is time saved. If you need to adapt to a 7-Star Tera Raid and swap some abilities around, you won't need to either go to a store and buy the TM yourself and/or you don't need to create it using the TM machine.\nStealth Rock is normally crafted by using 5000 LP, Rockruff Rock x3, and Rolycoly Coal x3: which is a tad more valuable than Baton Pass, which only needs 3000 LP, Eevee Fur x3, and Girafarig Fur x3.\nHow to redeem Mystery Gift codes in Pokemon Scarlet & Violet\nAfter the treasure hunt starts (read: following your full tour of the academy), you can select the mystery gift option in the main X button menu.

Ufouria was essentially the only new reveal, and all we got was a screenshot. They showed off Trip World DX and Gimmick!, but we didn’t even get a release date for Gimmick! beyond “soon.” Trip World DX previously received an announcement, with Limited Run Games handling the physical versions of it. Pre-orders start April 28.\nUfouria: The Saga (known as Hebereke in Japan) notably never released in North America prior to its arrival on the Wii Virtual Console. However, it has never been ported well. The Virtual Console re-releases run at the PAL region’s 50hz, making everything run too fast. Despite the poor quality of the ports, Ufouria: The Saga has developed a cult following.\nUnlike Gimmick!, which is just getting a modernized port, Ufouria will enjoy a full remake, with the demonstrated screenshot showing off a crafty art style similar to Yoshi’s Wooly World. We don't know much else aside from a planned 2023 release. There is no word on whether the character depicted in the screenshot will have the western “Bop-Louie” nomenclature or revert to the Japanese “Hebe.” Personally, I think “Bop-Louie” is just such an amazingly cute name.\nThe horrible Vtuber running the stream makes coy mention of two unannounced projects. We can only hope that one is the rumored Clock Tower port/remaster/remake. We’ll have to wait and hope for a better stream in the future.\nThe post Ufouria remake announced for 2023 release appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's not impossible, as we saw with Pocket Card Jockey: Ride On! earlier this year. Now, we have an idea of what the game will look like when it launches in a few weeks for Nintendo Switch and PC.\nYesterday, Atlus dropped a new trailer for the HD remasters that includes a detailed look at how dungeon mapping will work, as well as building your squad and battling monsters.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4zB2IkAXS0\nAs much as I like these games and as much fun as I know I'll have with them, I just don't know if the stars will align for me this year to actually play them. Etrian Odyssey games are a huge timesink, and getting three at once would basically take up two months' worth of free time for me. Also, there is a non-zero chance I won't still be playing The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom by the time these games roll out.\nStill, I just may have to pick them up and keep 'em on hand for when I do have the time...like when I'm 80.\nEtrian Odyssey Origins Collection will launch for Nintendo Switch and PC on June 1. Each game will retail for $39.99, or you can buy the three together for $79.99. Preorders are open, and if you do buy early, you can unlock Atlus-themed character portraits for each of the games, including Aigis from Persona 3 Portable, Nahobino from Shin Megami Tensei V, and Joker from Persona 5 Royal.\nThe post Etrian Odyssey Origins Collection is looking good in this gameplay trailer appeared first on Destructoid.",

Truth be told I expected this thing to arrive in Q3 or Q4 of this year, but, uh, it's out on April 25!\nFollowing the core reveal, the Nintendo of America YouTube channel also gave us a new song from the DLC, and it's a banger. The track is called \"New Battle!!!\" (make sure you get those three exclamation marks in there), and I can't wait to listen to it over and over in-game. Suddenly, the massive string of emotional JRPGs I played from the '90s through the early aughts came rushing back to me. I love how much Xenoblade Chronicles just does that on a regular basis, dating back to the release of the original on the Wii.\nWith each and every release the Xenoblade name continues to be out there, and I hope that when the next inevitable entry drops, it's an even bigger success. Also, timing! This DLC got in right before Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, which is going to be dominating the collecting gaming conversation come mid-May.

The Mageseeker is the latest of these efforts to create a compelling story within the world of Runeterra, creating a new flavor of League storytelling with an action RPG coating. And, for the most part, it works.\nDeveloper Digital Sun, known for their own previous action RPG Moonlighter, definitely makes its mark on the League timeline. A focus on Sylas, the once-chained mage now caught between his potential as a revolutionary and his selfish desire for revenge, lends itself well to both a different kind of story and an interesting take on combat. \nEven when it stutters and stumbles, The Mageseeker: A League of Legends Stor…",

          "description": "An offer you should maybe consider\nPromising-looking deckbuilder, Don Duality, will give you a taste of its panache on April 21 through the Don Duality: Initiation demo.\nComing from developer Königsborgs and publisher Ravenage Games, Don Duality has the makings of a game that speaks my language. This language, of course, consists of restaurant management and crime. The game is a deckbuilder where you take the role of a mafia family’s new don, and you work to re-establish your family’s power.\nhttps://youtu.be/hUWaYmFx9SI\nGameplay involves hiring thugs, sending them out to do crime, and then laundering the goods through your restaurant establishment. Don Duality looks like a simple little game, but I loved the crime/restaurant angle present in the Pizza Connection games.\nI know I lost a few of you when I said deckbuilder. Personally, I’ve found myself enjoying the genre the more I explore it. Mahokenshi was perhaps the first time I really felt engaged with the mechanics, but there are many more that I’ve experienced since then that I’ve connected with. I feel that it allows for an easily understood abstraction of random mechanics. However, I can understand that it can be a bit vexing to anyone who hates being shown exactly how bad their luck is, as well as anyone who hates mechanics that involve things outside their direct control.\nNonetheless, you’ll get your chance to see if Don Duality is for your tastes before dropping money on it. Don Duality: Initiation will release on PC on April 21, 2023. The release for the full game is a little less clear and will likely depend on feedback.\nThe post Pixel art management deckbuilder Don Duality gets prologue demo April 21 appeared first on Destructoid.",

The two statues see Siegward and Siegmeyer in personality-reflective poses, and feature fine detailing to their armor and bases, with atmospheric elements of dirt, grime, and battle damage.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoWP-p2BOII&ab_channel=First4Figures\nWhile undeniably delightful pieces, that would fit snugly into the guardhouse of the most dedicated Dark Souls fan — the added security of having the Onion Knights in your home comes at a cost. Each statue retails for a princely £250 GBP (or roughly $300 USD), and thus customers are looking at around £500 for the pair, not including shipping charges. You can check out both Siegward and Siegmeyer over on the official First 4 Figures website, where various staggered payment options are also available.\nThe Dark Souls Siegward and Siegmeyer statues are expected to ship from First 4 Figures in the first quarter of 2024.\nThe post Dark Souls Siegward & Siegmeyer statues will stand guard, for a price appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The stealthiest confirmation of the Indie World Showcase\nThe short but sweet Nintendo Indie World Showcase gave us a deeper look at a small selection of Indie titles. Titles like Rift of the NecroDancer and the Dunkey-published Animal Well were featured, but neither received specific release dates. This makes it incredibly humorous that one of the most anticipated Indie titles of the year did get a confirmed release date… as part of the ending montage.\nThat’s right, if you kept your eyes glued to the end, you might have seen Bomb Rush Cyberfunk get a brief shoutout. Except instead of showing a “Q3” release date, the launch was confirmed for August 18, 2023. I have absolutely zero idea why Bomb Rush Cyberfunk didn’t warrant a prominent feature during the Direct with this information. Everything shown looked good, but this is news, dang it. Confirmation that we’ll get to play it this August is a big deal!\nMaking the situation even more humorous, Team Reptile uploaded a new trailer for Bomb Rush Cyberfunk following the Indie showcase. This would have been a perfectly exciting way to end the stream, but at least we have the footage now to enjoy.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAwGzZ-x3H0\nQuibbles about the handling of the announcement aside, I'm glad to see a release date nailed down here. Bomb Rush Cyberfunk immediately turned heads with its Jet Set Radio influence, which we happen to like a lot around here. Considering the Indie in question already faced a delay, hard confirmation shows the game’s development is right on track. I can't wait to try this title, especially if the final product lives up to the footage we’ve seen.\nBomb Rush Cyberfunk will release on PC, Mac, Linux, and the Nintendo Switch.\nThe post Bomb Rush Cyberfunk will release on August 18, 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Night School Studio's Oxenfree II: Lost Signals is scheduled to launch on July 12, 2023.\nThe follow-up to 2016's Oxenfree sees protagonist Riley Poverly return to her hometown in Camena. As a newly hired research assistant, she's investigating the local phenomena that's been interfering with electronics and radios. Her job is to set up radio transmitters around certain areas and report the data. Should be easy, right?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7AJBSII0Q8\nWell, get a cult and some spirits involved, and you've got a long night ahead. Much like the first Oxenfree, choices will shape your story and future, as you deal with the strange oddities creating all these disturbances. As shown in a trailer during today's Nintendo Indie World Showcase, things may not always go as planned.\nAll the outs in free\nOxenfree II sees Night School returning to the spooky 2016 adventure, following 2019's partying romp through the underworld in Afterparty and a few other projects.\nMeanwhile, it's also Night School's newest project under Netflix, as the studio was acquired by the streaming giant in 2021. It's nice to see that the acquisition didn't cancel the studio's plans for a sequel at the time.\nIt's exciting to see Oxenfree II get a date locked in, and to have it during the summer too. Sure, the original was released in January 2016, but it's a distinctly \"summer\" game to me. It's about a bunch of angsty, worrying teens on their final summer vacation, and absolutely worth your time ahead of the sequel's launch. And with a July launch, the sequel is also thankfully avoiding the traffic jam of games in June.\nOxenfree II: Lost Signals hits Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PS5, PC via Steam, and the Netflix platform on July 12, 2023.\nThe post Oxenfree II: Lost Signals tunes into some otherworldly mysteries this July appeared first on Destructoid.",

Alongside it is Teslagrad Remastered, an upgraded version of the 2013 indie title. It features improved visuals and ten extra challenge levels. Rain Games says they have taken a \"light-touch\" approach to the remaster, so don't expect any drastic changes.\nTeslagrad 2 was first announced back in 2020. Like the original, it's a physics-based puzzle-platformer centered around electromagnetism. It's a Metroidvania set in a Scandinavian-inspired world. \"Scandivania\" is the word they've cleverly coined to describe it. The sequel boasts an expanded world and visual storytelling without the use of text or voice.\nI never played the first Teslagrad because, at that point, we had just been swamped by puzzle-platformers in the wake of games like Trine. However, it's been some time since the heyday of XBLA, so I might be interested in trying it out now.\nDespite being part of Nintendo's Indie World stream, both Teslagrad 2 and Teslagrad Remastered will be available today on all the platforms it was announced for.

Today, they have announced that they’ve followed through, acquired the studio, and rebranded it as Epic Brasil. That would be fine, but the developer is now mostly working on Fortnite content.\nIt feels like the entire industry is on a slow collapse into a Fortnite singularity. Not, like, actually, but it’s an amusing and horrifying thought.\nBeyond the Horizon Chase series, Aquiris has been largely a mobile developer. Some of their more notable titles include Wonderbox and Looney Tunes World of Mayhem. Last year, they released Horizon Chase 2 on mobile platforms, with PC and console ports planned for this year.\nAn additional Fortnite support studio is only one function of the new Epic Brasil. They also state that this is to establish a presence in South America and “spotlight” the region’s developers.\n“With the creation of Epic Games Brasil, we look forward to tapping into the immense talent the region has to offer and establishing our presence in Latin America,” said Alain Tascan, Executive Vice President of Game Development at Epic Games in the press release.\nIn the interim, Epic Brasil will still continue to work on supporting the titles it did as Aquiris. However, the press release is pretty clear, saying, “the AQUIRIS team of developers will join Epic Games to create groundbreaking content and social experiences within Fortnite.” There is no word on whether or not this will affect the PC and console port of Horizon Chase 2.\nThe post Epic Games acquires Horizon Chase developer Aquiris appeared first on Destructoid.",

This number, as noted by Eurogamer, represents double Panic's forecast for the admittedly niche, but intriguing device.\nAnnounced back in 2019, Playdate was pitched as a hand-cranked portable console that would play a library of titles, released on rotational/seasonal basis. Interest quickly spread about the quirky platform, which lead to pre-orders selling out in a scant 20 minutes, as interested parties snapped up one of the initial 20,000 planned production models. To date, over 27,000 Playdate consoles have been shipped to their owners, with the team at Panic working hard to fulfill the surprising demand.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdF3CnFvxg4&ab_channel=Panic\n\"To have now sold more than 53,000 (and counting) is heartening,\" said Panic in an anniversary statement. \"And this, at a time when parts shortages forced our delivery lead-times out as much as a year. As those lead times shorten and Playdate delivery becomes more immediate, we’re looking forward to an even better Year Two.\"\nPlaydate is currently available to pre-order over on the official website, priced at $199 USD. Due to demand, shipping of new orders is not expected until the latter months of 2023, at least.\nPlaydate has now sold 53,000 units, doubling initial sales expectations [Eurogamer]\nThe post Playdate has surpassed 50,000 sales since its release appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Diablo IV may have gone gold, but Blizzard wants to ensure the servers are durable one more time before launch. Thus, it's opening the gates of Sanctuary to players one more time in a third open beta next month. \nThis next test weekend, dubbed Server Slam weekend, begins May 12 at 12 p.m. Pacific and ends May 14 at the same time. As the name suggests, Blizzard is running this beta to stress test the servers to make sure they're as sturdy as possible come June. This slice of the game is similar to the March betas in terms of content, but it will include updates and bug fixes garnered from feedback to the previous betas.\nServer Slam weekend will be a clean slate as progression from the previous betas does not carry over. Additionally, the beta supports couch co-op, cross-play, and cross-progression. Players can explore Fractured Peaks in its entirety through the Prologue and Act 1, complete World Events, and face Ashava, the toughest available World Boss. Completing challenges can earn the following new rewards:\nThe Initial Casualty title (earned by reaching Kyovashad with one character)\nThe Early Voyager title (earned by reaching Level 20 on one character)\nThe Beta Wolf Pack Cosmetic (earned by reaching Level 20 with one character)\nA new reward: the Cry of Ashava Mount Trophy (earned by defeating Ashava with one Level 20 character).\nDiablo IV launches on June 6 for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. It’s also Game Informer’s cover story for this month, and you can subscribe to the digital version of the magazine to read the issue or subscribe to the print edition hitting mailboxes this month.",

The footage showcases the protagonist, Jak, switching between his red, green, and blue magic for various attacks while also executing a number of powerful Furies, and using his Lash ability to pull enemies toward him and pull himself toward grapple points. You also get to see a little bit of puzzle-solving, which will also play a major role in the game.\n\n\nAlong with the gameplay footage, Ascendant also shared a video, seen below, highlighting some of the game's environments, which will be one of the first commercial games to use Unreal 5.1.\n\n\nFor a whole lot more on Immortals of Aveum, you can check out some hands-on impressions of the game resulting from a recent visit to Ascendant Studios here.

It will release on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC. Alongside this release date, Night School Studio also released a new trailer showcasing more of what to expect in this spooky paranormal thriller and there's a lot going on. \n\n\nSet five years after the first Oxenfree, which was released in 2016, Oxenfree II follows Riley as she returns to her hometown of Camena to investigate some strange electromagnetic waves. Just four hours ago, a mysterious cult opened a portal above Edwards Island, and Riley and her friends aren't sure they're the ones that need to save the island but they know they have to. The trailer seems to indicate we'll be playing with different timelines, spooky ghosts from other side, and more, and we'll be doing so using a special radio. \nThis time, though, we'll also have a walkie talkie to interact with locals and learn more about what might be going on. Oxenfree II: Lost Signals looks great and it hits PlayStation, Switch, and PC on July 12, 2023. \nOxenfree II: Lost Signals was originally due out in 2022 but it was delayed to 2023 last September. About a year before that delay, the game's developer was acquired by Netflix and you can read more about what that means for the studio here. \nAre you checking out Oxenfree II: Lost Signals this summer?

Publisher Humble Games announced this during today's Nintendo Indie World Showcase alongside a new trailer showcasing more of the game's titular night market. Unsurprisingly, Mineko's Night Market continues to look great and we can't wait to learn more about this special village later this year. \n\n\nIn Mineko's Night Market, an old Japanese-inspired village at the center of Mt. Fugu is visited long ago by Miko, a cat-like god. Miko visits the farms of this village each year to grant good fortune and prosperity to the farmers. However, some farmers grow impatient with their blessings and drive Miko out. With Miko banished from the land, this village works hard to create its own success and as time goes on, fewer and fewer people believe in the myth of Miko. \nBut some still do, and it sounds like we'll learn more about what that means for some characters throughout our journey in the game. \nIn the game, you'll befriend townsfolk, craft doodads, and ultimately prepare for the weekly night market. The quiet village becomes a bustling hub of commerce, parades, cat races, and stage performances. And when you're exploring the island, everything you find can be brought back and sold on the market. \nMineko's Night Market hits Switch and PC on September 26, 2023. \nAre you checking out Mineko's Night Market later this year?

The novelty alone is worth some enthusiasm. However, despite a valiant attempt at a fresh take, this bite-sized release falls short in some key areas.\nTron:…",

While some Nintendo streams start in the wee hours of the morning, this one's not too bad, airing at 9 a.m. on the West Coast and 12 p.m. on the East Coast. The video will be available on YouTube here. After the games are announced, you can see all their eShop listings on the Indie World website. Read the full event announcement below.\nJoin us tomorrow, April 19, at 9:00 a.m. PT for a new @IndieWorldNA Showcase!

Still, there are plenty of games to be excited about. Like clockwork, every time an Indie World showcase is announced, \"Silksong\" starts trending on Twitter as fans of Hollow Knight eagerly await the follow-up to the 2017 Metroidvania. For a general idea of what to expect, here's a recap from the last Indie World event, shown in November 2022.\nWhich games do you hope to see at the showcase tomorrow? Let us know in the comments!",

That means the game is essentially complete and is ready to be pressed to discs.\nThe game is set to arrive on PlayStation and Xbox consoles plus PC, and while it's good to go for launch, Blizzard plans to continually update the always-online game with various content updates over the next several years. Fans recently got to explore the game's revamped take on Sanctuary for themselves in two back-to-back weekend open betas in March, letting them taste a big slice of the now-finished pie.\n“Going gold is a landmark milestone for the incredible Diablo IV team, who have all worked so hard crafting the next-generation installment of this iconic franchise. This is a concrete, meaningful step toward our June 6 launch,” said Rod Fergusson, general manager of Diablo. “Whether players are veterans of the franchise or jumping in for the first time, we can’t wait for everyone to experience the full game: taking part in the incredible storytelling, experimenting with character classes and builds, and exploring what the endgame and the dark world of Sanctuary has to offer.”\nDiablo IV is Game Informer’s cover story this month, and you can subscribe to the digital issue to read it right now.

In his announcement tweet, Staten confirms that the game is a brand-new IP and referred to the project as a \"AAA multiplatform\" experience. You can read the full tweets below.\nSo today, I'm thrilled to announce that I've joined @Netflix Games as Creative Director for a brand-new AAA multiplatform game and original IP. Let's go! 2/2\nApril 17, 2023\nStaten is best known for his work as a writer and cinematic director at Bungie and Microsoft, mainly working on the Halo series. While he spent a few years working at the publishing side of Microsoft, in 2020, he returned to the Halo series to work on Halo Infinite, where he worked as the game's creative director. This continued until earlier this year when he returned to the publishing side of the company amidst widespread layoffs. Now, he's left the company entirely to work on this new project with Netflix.\nThis is only the latest news in Netflix's spree of expansion into the gaming industry. It recently released a sequel to Valiant Hearts as part of a collaboration with Ubisoft. Last year, it acquired the developers behind Cozy Grove, bringing its total number of internal development teams to five if you include the in-house studio that Staten just joined. On top of that, the film and tv side of Netflix has been working on loads of game adaptations, including Gears of War, Pokémon Concierge, and a new patch of episodes of Sonic Prime.\nDo you play games through your Netflix subscription?

After over a year of silence, we now know the project is officially underway, as well as the cast that will bring the series to life. \nSonic the Hedgehog director Jeff Fowler also sits at the helm of this series, and he tweeted the above image of the Knuckles clapperboard complete with the character’s cowboy hat that he donned in the ‘90s animated film Sonic the Hedgehog: The Movie. Production is currently taking place in London, with Sonic the Hedgehog 2 screenwriter John Whittington serving as head writer and executive producer. \n#knuckles pic.twitter.com/Hr4zNjuLuj\nApril 17, 2023\nThe show is expected to premiere on Paramount+ later this year, with Idris Elba reprising his role as Knuckles. Variety reports that other returning stars from the films include Adam Pally as Wade Whipple and Tika Sumpter as Maddie. The cast also includes Edi Patterson (The Righteous Gemstones), Julian Barratt (Mindhorn), Scott Mescudi (AKA Kid Cudi), Ellie Taylor (Ted Lasso), and Rory McCann (Game of Thrones).\nPlot details remain scant, but Knuckles is set after the events of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and before the upcoming third film, set to hit theaters on December 20, 2024. The story centers on Knuckles taking on Wade as his student, training him to become an Echidna warrior. \nAre you looking forward to the Knuckles series? Let us know in the comments!",

This acquisition will begin next month and is expected to conclude in the second quarter of the 2024 fiscal year once it's completed the necessary antitrust reviews. \n“Among the rapidly growing global gaming market, the mobile gaming market has especially high potential, and it has been Sega’s long-term goal to accelerate its expansion in this field,” says Haruki Satomi, president and group CEO of Sega Sammy Holdings. “I feel blessed to be able to announce such a transaction with Rovio, a company that owns 'Angry Birds', which is loved across the world, and home to many skilled employees that support the company’s industry leading mobile game development and operating capabilities. Historically, as represented by the ‘Sonic the Hedgehog' series, Sega has released countless video game titles to various gaming platforms. I am confident that, through combination of both companies’ brands, characters, fanbase, as well as corporate culture and functionality, there will be significant synergies created going forward.”\n“Red and Sonic the Hedgehog: two globally recognized and iconic characters made by two remarkably complementary companies, with a worldwide reach that spans mobile, PC/console, and beyond,” says Rovio CEO Alexandre Pelletier-Normand in a statement. “Combining the strengths of Rovio and Sega presents an incredibly exciting future.”\nRovio is best known as the creator of Angry Birds, a massively successful series of mobile games that have since turned into a global media brand. In addition to a multitude of games, the series has spawned two animated films and several TV and web series.",

The previous logo was pretty much just the letter R too, but this one has a different font and kind of hurts our eyes looking at it. \nIn a blog post, Remedy gives its simple rationale for the update: \n“The bullet in the letter R in the old logo represented the era of Max Payne, but the Remedy of now is much bigger than a single game; we have a whole portfolio of games, new and old.  \nIt was time to update and redefine our visual identity to bring more consistency, showcase our evolution over the years, and better express our vision of today’s Remedy.”\nSo there you have it.

Though the story begins by following protagonist Clive in his 20s, the plot will also explore periods of his teen years and 30s. We got a look at the world map, various accessibility rings, and the combat prowess of Clive’s faithful wolf companion, Torgal. \nWe also looked at Cid’s hideaway, a large headquarters that opens up later in the game where you can craft gear, buy items at a store, check quests, interact with allies, and practice abilities in a special training room. Despite showing off so much, teases that Square Enix still has plenty to share in the future regarding story quests, side quests, and endgame content. \nFinal Fantasy XVI launches on June 22 for PlayStation 5. You can learn more about the game by reading our recent features breaking down the game's Eikon combat, Arcade Mode, and interviews with the developers who discuss the game's balance of multiple gameplay styles, its return to high-fantasy, and the series' abandonment of turn-based action.",

          "description": "Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League has been delayed to next year following recent rumors that it wasn't going to make its May 26 release date. \nThe superhero co-op shooter will now launch on February 2, 2024. Developer Rocksteady posted a short message on Twitter stating it wants to “take the time needed” to ensure the best possible experience. Check it out below.\nSuicide Squad: Kill the Justice League puts players in the shoes of Harley Quinn, Captain Boomerang, Deadshot, and King Shark as they fight to rescue Metropolis from an invasion by Brainiac. The villain has hijacked the minds of the Justice League, meaning the Squad has to take down Earth's greatest protectors to save the day. The game has received a hefty dose of fan vitriol since its last gameplay demonstration in February confirmed an always-online requirement as well as live service elements, such as a cosmetics-only battle pass. Other fans have found its cooperative loot-based shooting to be an uninspired fit for the property.\nAlthough we don't know the specifics behind the delay, sources told Bloomberg in its original report last month that Rocksteady was only pushing the game to add polish and did not plan to overhaul the game’s existing framework. Even though a nearly-year-long delay is a lot of time, it's still very unlikely that it's enough for the team to make the sort of dramatic changes some fans are hoping for. We'll have to wait and see how Rocksteady spruces up the Suicide Squad and hope it results in a quality experience when the dust finally settles. \nWhat do you think of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League's delay?

That big honor goes to the classic Super Mario Bros. theme.\nOfficially titled “Ground Theme,” it was composed by Nintendo’s Koji Kondo and first appeared in 1985’s Super Mario Bros in World 1-1. The song has since become the most well-known melody of the Mario franchise, not to mention one of the most recognizable music tracks in video games. Now, it will be forever preserved alongside some of pop culture's most famous and influential songs. \n“Having this music preserved alongside so many other classic songs is such a great honor,” said Kondo in a statement. “It's actually a little bit difficult to believe.”\nMario’s classic tune will be inducted alongside heavy hitters such as Madonna’s “Like a Virgin,” Jimmy Buffet’s “Margaritaville,” Queen Latifah’s “All Hail the Queen,” and Mariah Carey’s “All I Want for Christmas is You.” You can read the full list of inductees at the Libary of Congress’ website. \nThis is quite an achievement for Nintendo and especially Kondo, who has lent his talents to numerous other Nintendo soundtracks and also had a hand in composing the music for the very successful The Super Mario Bros. Movie. You can read our recent interview with Kondo and Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto about the making of the film here.",

That includes a $206 million domestic haul, $146 million of which was earned over the weekend (remember the film premiered on a Wednesday). Overseas, the movie has earned over $173 million.\nAdditionally, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is now the top opening film of 2023 (beating Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania), has become Illumination’s most successful opening, and has the best opening of any video game film adaptation (surpassing Sonic the Hedgehog 2's debut). The film also has the biggest five-day premiere ever, a record previously held by Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. If all of that wasn’t enough, the film also has the biggest IMAX opening weekend of all time at $21.6 million globally.\nNeedless to say, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is exceeding expectations, and it’ll be interesting to see if it can maintain such a strong start. To get an idea of how it fares, you can read our review of the film here.

          "description": "For April's issue of Game Informer magazine, we took a look behind the scenes at Hyper Light Breaker, the latest game from developer Heart Machine. In addition to an interview with Creative Director Alx Preston, we were able to view exclusive footage of one of the game's mini-bosses, The Last Master. Check out the reveal below.\n\n\nThe Last Master is a deadly opponent that spawns randomly when players (known in this world as Breakers) activate beacons, objects that allow them to access the main boss gate. If you think she looks similar to the player characters, you've got the right idea; in the video, Preston says \"She ended up here in this land as a Breaker and succumbed to the dangers of the Overgrowth.\" As a result, The Last Master's arsenal mirrors yours, wielding a sword, a spear, and an automatic pistol. Her behavior mirrors the Breakers' as well, and she can dash, jump, and climb after anyone that attempts to escape.\nWhile the first game in the Hyper Light franchise was a 2D single-player experience, this new title is a 3-player co-op rogue-lite, with a new procedurally generated open world on every run. Players will create a Breaker, explore a cursed land called the Overgrowth, and attempt to the bosses plaguing this realm known as Crowns.\n\nFor more of the game, check out our feature in the latest issue of Game Informer. You also can see the initial reveal trailer here and the IGN's gameplay reveal right here. Hyper Light Breaker enters early access this fall.",

We spoke with several of the game’s principal designers at Blizzard to learn more about the game’s endgame content, such as Helltides and Nightmare Dungeons, and provide a final overview of everything the game has to offer before it launches on June 6.\nSetting the table for Diablo IV’s dark tone are two haunting pieces of cover art designed by the famed artist Brom. Our standard cover showcases the heavenly might of the rogue angel Inarius while the Game Informer Gold cover features Lilith, Diablo IV’s main antagonist, in all her demonic glory.\nIssue 355 also includes a conversation about life and death with former Tango Gameworks artist and director Ikumi Nakamura in the abandoned streets of late-night Tokyo (which you can read online). You’ll also find an entertaining personal story about using VR as a carnival scam, a feature detailing Devil May Cry 5’s influence on Final Fantasy XVI’s combat, and an emotional piece discussing how a grieving father found solace in the Shenmue series’ depiction of loss. You'll also be treated to previews for upcoming titles, including Redfall, Exoprimal, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. \nYou can also try to nab a Game Informer Gold version of the issue. Limited to a numbered print run per issue, this premium version of Game Informer isn't available for sale. To learn about places where you might be able to get a copy, check out our official Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, and stay tuned for more details in the coming weeks.

There are no cars, people, or sounds to distract me. I can’t avoid what I’m seeing: a host of creatures about to be murdered.\nWe’re standing at a slaughterhouse. But it’s a slaughterhouse in a deeply strange location, or, as Nakamura calls it, “Silicon Valley,” the technology district of Shinagawa in Tokyo, Japan. As I look at trucks packed full of cows at – whether they know it or not – the end of their lives, immense skyscrapers surround us, housing tech goliaths. Sony, Canon, and Microsoft all have offices here.

The event will also feature a number of Nintendo-themed activities scattered across the venue. \n“Fans of all ages can currently experience the unique games, characters and worlds of Nintendo on Nintendo Switch, but we want to expand that scope with a new experience,” said Nintendo of America President Doug Bowser in a press release. “With Nintendo Live 2023, we’re giving attendees a chance to celebrate together with family, friends and the broader Nintendo community in the spirit of fun and creating long-lasting memories.”\nThere’s no information on the exact date or location for the event nor when ticket sales begin, but you can keep an eye on the event’s official website to learn more once those details become available.

However, as Double Fine founder Tim Schafer, who made his name working on point-and-click adventure games for LucasArts, seemed to think, there was still a sizable enough audience out there that someone should make a new one. Why not Double Fine? And why not go directly to the source – the fans – for the game's funding?\nIn Double Fine's pitch, it theorized the then-unnamed project as a smaller game. The company asked for $400,000 from fans – specifically $300,000 to make the game and $100,000 to allow documentary crew 2 Player Productions to film the development.
