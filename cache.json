Is it Mass Effect? Maybe some iteration of Smash or Mario Kart? The big one when I was that age was Street Fighter II in all its iterations. But there's another game that brings back the most vivid memories, and it's incredibly stupid: Wall Street Kid for the NES.\nMy friend Russ and I loved JRPGs, and Wall Street Kid fit the bill, I guess. After finishing another playthrough of Final Fantasy II (now properly known as FFIV) on our brand-new SNES, we'd switch over to the older Nintendo system to engage in raw casino capitalism. This game was, frankly, much more challenging than levelling up Cecil, Rosa, and Kain, and I vividly recall tossing my rectangular controller when I failed to make a million dollars to buy a starter home, inadvertently toppling a two-litre bottle of Pepsi. It was three in the morning.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

You’ve got to water your fields, rotate your crops, and keep an eye on the market prices to make sure you’re able to pull a decent profit. If you’ve ever dreamed of trying your hand at this noble profession but don’t have hundreds of acres of land to play with, Farming Simulator 23: Nintendo Switch Edition is here to provide you with the realistic farming action that might be missing from games like Stardew Valley and Story of Seasons.\nSimulator games are a tricky lot; they don’t necessarily need to have the best graphics, but they need to have a realistic feel when you’re behind the wheel of these machines. Farming Simulator 23 goes to a lot of effort to recreate farm equipment for you to ride around in. The tractors, tills, and plows all feel like something you might have been stuck behind while going down a country road. While we might not have driven them personally, most of us have seen them in action before and the vehicles in this game do a good job of replicating how they move and handle.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "When my Sleeper escaped their ramshackle life on the fringes of Erlin's Eye at the end of last year, they left behind a lot of unfinished business. I had to stop short my efforts to help Bliss make a go of her repair bay business, and Tala was left to finish making her brand-new distillery on her own. Yatagan agent Rabiyah probably has my name on an employment blacklist, too, after I upped sticks without telling them, and the spores of mushroom algae I'd been cultivating for Riko over in Greenway were no doubt left to rot and moulder somewhere. Instead, I jacked that all in to smuggle myself, my engineering pal Lem and his tiny daughter Mina onto a ship headed for some far-flung star out in the void. The Sidereal ship wasn't going to wait. It was now or never.\nFortunately hitting an ending in Citizen Sleeper doesn't mean the end of your save. Booting it back up again for this month's RPS Game Club, I wanted to play out a different ending to my Sleeper's story. Turning my back on Lem and Mina still brought its own kind of sadness, admittedly, but I wanted to dig into the game's trio of free DLC episodes first and foremost, as that was another thing I never got time to start last year. I've only played through the first chapter, Flux, so far, but man alive, it was not an auspicious start for the refugee flotilla ship hoping to make a new life for themselves here. In fact, I don't think it could have gone any worse, such was the monumental failure of my collective dice rolls and decision making. But despite absolutely beefing it in Flux, I also came to realise an important lesson. It's okay to fail, and that failure can often make the consequences of your actions feel all the more poignant. Sure, it might not feel nice, and yes, I wish it could have gone better. But sometimes the odds really are stacked against you, and you've just got to roll with it.\nRead more",

Developed internally at Frontier, it promises to be a modern take on the classic RTS, giving you four unique factions to play with, including the Stormcast Eternals and Orruk Kruleboyz, across a single player campaign and 1v1 and 2v2 competitive multiplayer modes. I got to see a little bit of an alpha build of Realms Of Ruin in action ahead of tonight's Skulls stream, and if you're a fan of tabletop miniatures, this is definitely an RTS you'll want to keep an eye on, as Frontier have gone all out on making this look as close to Age Of Sigmar's TT origins as they can.

Between the soulless platforming, undercooked stealth, tedious storytelling, and framerate stuttering so bad it’s got me killed twice, Gollum is perilously short on likeable qualities. Especially if you’re not into LOTR lore, or fine hattery.\nIn my unclad head, then, Gollum’s highlight so far has been DLSS 3. It’s one of just a few dozen games to support the newest, most artificially intelligent version of Nvidia’s deep learning-powered upscaler, and frankly makes a very compelling argument for switching it on.

Though it’s likely more of an RTX 4060 rival, given the RX 7600 will go on sale tomorrow – May 25th – at £260 / $269, slightly less than the $299-tagged 4060.\nBased on the same RDNA 3 architecture as the Radeon RX 7900 XT and RX 7900 XTX, the RX 7600 nonetheless targets a much more widely-used monitor resolution than those 4K-minded GPU hulks. Which makes a nice change, and means AMD will beat Nvidia’s RTX 40 series to the punch on a sub-£300 GPU, with the RTX 4060 not set for release until July.\nRead more",

If you’ve played the memorably odd Mutant Year Zero or the largely forgettable Corruption 2029, you’ll know it by now – a blend of real-time stealth and turn-based tactics, where you quietly pick off stragglers from enemy squads before confronting the rest in a team scrap. Now here’s Miasma Chronicles, the Ladies’ third effort, and let’s just say they’re clearly happy to stick with what they know.\nWhile the patterns of play are to a great extent the same, though, Miasma Chronicles is a more ambitious project. Addressing criticisms that those earlier games weren’t substantial enough, it’s a broader, denser beast, in which you could easily spend twice as long – 30 hours or so – seeing all the sights and shooting the nasties that populate them. That means there’s a lot more space available for this game to coax out varied strategies and introduce more elements, which is great. But it also means the weaker elements of the formula are left more exposed, which isn’t.\nRead more",

Boltgun. What’s the gameplay like? Boltgun! What’s the story? BOLTGUN! Okay, there is technically a story, but it’s a thin excuse to let you shoot crunchy Chaos things in 40k, and shooting things in 40k means BOLTGUN!!!\nBoltgun is a retro-styled first-person shooter, or boomer shooter, to use the parlance of our times. Cast as a Space Marine, one of 40k’s genetically engineered fascist super soldiers, it’s your job to secure the Plot Device and prevent 40k’s already crappy Imperium from getting even crappier. As you can probably guess, this means running around at incredible speeds and shooting hordes of cultists, traitors and daemons in the face until they fall down, explode into chunks of bright red gore, or both.\nRead more",

          "description": "After giving us an early glimpse of its unstoppable raptor hordes in a closed beta test last summer, Capcom recently let us loose with the opening hours of their upcoming dinosaur multiplayer shooter, Exoprimal. Its final release isn't far away now - its July 14th launch fast becoming the sole highlight of an otherwise desolate month - and I was excited to finally play the game that RPS vid bud Liam literally hasn't been able to stop talking about ever since he first clapped eyes (and his thumbs) on its somersaulting T-Rexes. (You should also read his excellent interview with the devs while you're at it, too). \nI'll hold my hands up now and say I didn't get to play as much of Exoprimal as I would have liked, but the handful of missions I did play really are as daft and brilliant as Liam described last year. I won't waste time repeating its fundamentals (you can read them here), but the basic setup is thus: in a world plagued by dinosaurs that periodically pour out of strange portals for some reason, you play a rookie dino hunter that gets pulled into a time-looping wargame set up by your company's clearly psychotic AI called Leviathan. In order to gather valuable 'combat data' for its simulations to fight said dinosaur threat, Leviathan endlessly ropes you and other rookie exosuit wearers into deadly feats of speed and skill. It's a neat, if patently preposterous setup for its 5v5 PvP multiplayer missions, but the thing that struck me most wasn't its gloriously silly dinosaurs or Leviathan's perfectly pitched ham lines. It was its bot companions, because heck, they're great to play with, but absolute fiends if you're on the wrong side of them.\nRead more",

They said a few years ago that we obviously shouldn't expect a simultaneous launch release, but some such as Death Stranding and The Last Of Us Part 1 have taken as little as six to eight months to come across, while others such as Spider-Man and Uncharted 4 have taken several years. \nAccording to PlayStation boss Jim Ryan, though, data from fans seem to suggest that the only \"acceptable\" route from a player point of view is a wait of two to three years. Outrageous, I say, but also: surely that means the long-sought-after Bloodborne must be next in line, right? Surely. It's been eight years, come on now. \nRead more",

In an interview with GQ, he talked about the baggage that inevitably comes with having a 35-year-old series with soon to be 16 numbered mainline games in it (not including the sequels and spin-offs, I might add), and the confusion it continues to create with new players. \"Every numbered title we release in the series, we have to go into it like, 'It's OK, you don't have to play the rest of them,'\" he said, and removing them is \"something that I've discussed with the higher-ups\". It's an understandable problem, for sure, although I think I'd be quite sad to see the numerals go entirely.

In the nine months since I took command of a T-Rex and did a sick backflip, my life has not known peace. “I’m really excited to play Exoprimal” I’ll say to colleagues, unprompted, in important meetings unrelated to anything prehistoric in nature. “From what I've played, it blends PvE and PvP gameplay into a single multiplayer mode that feels very unique and hugely entertaining”. My tax return was voided because I drew a big stegosaurus on it. I have renamed the cat “Sniper Neosaur”, and I am disappointed that she has yet to emerge from a gooey purple orb.\r\n\n\r\nIt was my delight, then, to be given the opportunity to sit down with key members of the game’s development team to discuss Exoprimal’s inspirations, its inevitable comparisons to Dino Crisis and how Capcom plans to use it as a template for their live-service games moving forward. Alongside a fresh opportunity to check out the game, I hopped onto a Zoom call with Exoprimal’s director Takuro Hiraoka, technical director Kazuki Abe and art director Takuro Fuse.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I don't remember why they were there, or what goal they were trying to achieve. It was just 'one of those caves' that looked cool and interesting when I came across it and I thought, 'Yeah, all right, let's have a go then, shall we?' But while other Skyrim caves I'd come across could be easily polished off in an office lunch-time - as that was often how I played Skyrim back then - this one was different somehow. It was so large and twisty, so infinitely befuddling, that I seemed to be trapped down there forever. Sure, I could have probably turned back, but I'd been down there for ages, and felt like I'd come too far to simply not see it all through to the bitter end. But the end never came, and I eventually abandoned my save as a result, whisked off by the prospect of newer, more exciting games that didn't involve trying to figure out how to escape its narrow, bioluminescent hellscape.\nWorse still, this disastrous feat of orienteering has now become my overriding memory of Skyrim. For all its great sidequests and its ever-increasing number of excellent mods, all I ever think about are its damn caves. Just the thought of loading up that save file again makes me grimace, and I'm starting to dread the thought of getting stuck in another one whenever the heck The Elder Scrolls 6 comes out. But I've been playing a lot of The Legend Of Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom this past week, and cor, I'm immediately jealous of Link's Ascend ability. As part of his new slate of powers, Ascend lets him instantly woosh through almost any ceiling as long as there's a traversable bit of terrain above it. That kind of power wouldn't have been half handy for my poor old wood elf, and it's precisely what makes exploring Tears Of The Kingdom's caves so enjoyable. So if there's one thing The Elder Scrolls 6 should steal take note of, please let it be this.\nRead more",

Across its six-hour run time, you'll encounter a string of environmental puzzles, an evil plan concocted by a group of baddies, a rich orchestral soundtrack that swells at all the right moments, a cute animal companion, and a gorgeous world that needs saving. \nOn paper, it has everything you could possibly want from this kind of game, but in practice, it can also be Lana's undoing at times. It does everything well - admittedly some much better than others - but it feels like this sci-fi tale is missing something. That gut punch, that sigh of relief after a thrill, that unexpected surprise... You know, that extra edge to really make it sing. It’s still a very enjoyable adventure, but its lack of emotional highs means it doesn't linger long in the memory once you've seen the credits roll. Is that a roundabout way to say that Planet of Lana is a solid 7/10? Maybe, but we don't do that here.\nRead more",

This Slavic shooter revels in the strange, straddling the line between hyper-bleak Soviet satire and goofy memetic joke factory. This isn't the best thing about HROT, we'll get to that in a couple of paragraphs. But the balancing of these two personality strands is what defines HROT's quality. At the outset, they exist in perfect symbiosis, but the relationship becomes less stable as the game goes on.\nThe year is 1986, and something is seriously wrong in the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. What that might be isn't explicitly stated, but given the year, the ambient chatter of Geiger counters, and the soldiers vomiting through their gasmasks as they prowl the abandoned streets, a nuclear disaster at an infamous Ukrainian power plant isn't a vast stretch of the imagination. In any case, anyone who wasn't killed by the fallout is now being hunted by an army of (presumably Russian, but again, it isn't explicated) soldiers. Emerging from a bomb shelter beneath Prague's Kosmonautů Metro Station (now named Háje), you take it upon yourself to defend your glorious homeland from these invaders.\nRead more",

I know you’ve all been waiting for your favourite PC gaming-focused website to offer their take on it so there you go. It’s properly, properly good. The best open-world adventure since Elden Ring, except arguably better because it doesn’t pull your trousers down and point out the colour of your underwear every time you dare to explore a forest or watch a sunset.\r\n\n\r\nAs you’ve probably seen, the game’s biggest new draw is “Ultrahand”, which allows Link to pick up loose objects and glue them together. Three logs make a raft. A plank and four wheels make a car. Two stones and a log make a... Ahem. You get the idea. In addition to this are “Zonai Devices”, components that give life and movement to your doohickeys. A fan pushes your raft across the lake. A steering stick lets you manoeuvre your little car. It’s a marvellous construction system that leverages the pre-existing physics engine seen in the game’s predecessor, Breath Of The Wild, to startling results. Does this all sound familiar?\r\n\n \nRead more",

That's probably why Amazon hit up Ergotron to make its Amazon Basics monitor arms, which offer the same excellent quality in unbranded form for considerably less money. \nToday though one of these arms is even better value than usual, as there's a ridiculous 40% off voucher available on Amazon's take on the Ergotron LX, dropping this high-end monitor arm from £81 to just £49. That's a brilliant price for an arm that can support monitors up to 11kg in weight with full tilt, swivel, rotation and height adjustability. \nRead more",

Hm.\nIt’s not that System Shock isn’t in need of a remake, either. Much like many PC games of its time, it’s extremely unfriendly. It’s not necessarily a difficult game, but the learning curve isn’t just steep; it’s also covered in dish soap and broken glass.

However, it won't be available to all-komers, nor will you won't be able to download it straight away.\nHow to gain access to the Mortal Kombat 1 Stress Test\n[caption id=\"attachment_382319\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1200\"] Screenshot by Destructoid[/caption]\nInterested parties cannot sign up for the Stress Test via their PlayStation or Xbox consoles. Instead, you'll need to go to WB Games' website on your PC to perform this task. Log in to your WB Games Account or create a new one. After signing in, you'll be given the opportunity to select an Xbox Series X/S or PS5 code. If you're selected, a code should be emailed to you.\nYes, the beta will not be available on PC or the Nintendo Switch. It makes sense as both of these versions are being developed by separate studios QLOC, Shiver Entertainment, and Saber Interactive. Thankfully, you won't need a PlayStation Plus or Xbox Live Gold subscription in order to take part in the test.\nIs the Mortal Kombat 1 Stress Test a beta?\nPublisher WB Games has said this stress test shouldn't be considered a beta. \"The purpose is to deliberately stress our online infrastructure and identify potential issues ahead of the game’s launch,\" said WB Games in an official Q&A. \"The test is also unrelated to the Mortal Kombat 1 Pre-Order Beta that has been announced for August 2023.\"\nIf you don't want to play Mortal Kombat 1 until it's fully released, you'll have to wait until September 19. You can test your might on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and PC (via Steam and Epic Games Store). A PS4 and Xbox One release is not currently scheduled. If you want to get back into Mortal Kombat earlier than that, the prior entry is available on Xbox Game Pass\nThe post How to sign up for Mortal Kombat 1 Stress Test appeared first on Destructoid.",

Choosing the name Cyber Citizen Shockman to differentiate it from the 1992 Tuborgrafx-16 title, Shockman, it feels as though it came out of nowhere.

There's a new method to easily acquire legendary shards in Destiny 2, and odds are it'll be gone before the weekend.\nWant to get infinite shards in Destiny 2? Well, then this is what you have to do\nMeet up with Ikora at The Tower, and take one of the exotic quests. Any will do the trick, so maybe get the first one.\nFollow the quest steps until the fourth step. No more, no less.\nHead back toward Ikora, talk to her, then get away from her without taking the armor.\nOpen the menu and chose to abandon the quest.\nTalk to her again, and congrats, you'll now be able to take infinite pieces of exotic armor.\nNow you just have to dismantle the exotic pieces of armor until you get tired of being rich or Bungie fixes the leaky golden fountain.\nYou'll get legendary shards each time you dismantle something, and you can keep doing it constantly. Youtuber Divide managed to blow this wide open, and you can watch their tutorial on how to use the glitch below:\nhttps://youtu.be/x5KDoBoUh9Y\nBungie will surely make short work of this bug very soon, so we highly recommend you check out this sweet early summer gift as soon as you can.\n[Update: Some players are reporting that there was a quick server-side fix that kicked them out of the game at roughly 6PM ET.

In this case, I’ll just lean on quoting the press release while interjecting with sobbing.\nhttps://twitter.com/ForeverEntert/status/1662112577113956355?s=20\n“This decision was not taken lightly,” taunts the press release, “but in collaboration with the development team, we want to ensure that we have sufficient time to add as many functionalities as possible while proceeding with proper implementation and tests, in order to meet your expectations for a modern-day remake.”\nAaaaaanh! Haaanh haaanh! Whhhhy!?\nUnable to provide us with an updated release date, the press release goes on to mock us by saying, “While we are currently unable to provide a specific revised premier date, we assure you that we are working tirelessly to complete the project as soon as possible, with the aim of releasing the game in the third quarter of this year.”\nTake all the time you need to finish Front Mission 2: Remake\nUgh. Seriously, although I’m very excited to get my hands on Front Mission 2: Remake, I would definitely prefer that they take all the time they need to make sure it’s the finished package they want to release. My tears may soak my face right now, but one day they will dry. Once I’m united with the next in the series of Front Mission facelifts, all will be forgiven and forgotten. For now, I weep.\nFront Mission 2: Remake is coming to Nintendo Switch. It is now aiming for a third-quarter 2023 release window.\nThe post Front Mission 2: Remake release has been pushed back appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "We're also getting Rune Factory 6\nThe development teams at Marvelous are certainly keeping themselves busy. Multiple upcoming games were revealed in the developer's game showcase yesterday, including a new Daemon X Machina game and two new entries in the Story of Seasons franchise. Rune Factory is also doubling up in development as Series Director Shiro Maekawa revealed the company is diligently working on two new titles in the series, Rune Factory Project Dragon and Rune Factory 6.\nProject Dragon seems to be the one further along in development, as Maekawa provided the first footage of this Rune Factory spin-off. The game is going with a Japanese-styled world as players will explore the \"Land of the East\" for the very first time. And it looks like they'll be able to do it while riding Tatsu dragons.\nhttps://youtu.be/N4NGndJUuMY?t=1185\nIt feels like a lot of franchises have been looking to ancient Japan for inspiration over the past few years, from Monster Hunter Rise to the upcoming Disgaea 7: Vows of the Virtueless. To me, that's a good thing. I haven't been able to get enough of the setting since playing Ghost of Tsushima. What little video we see of the new game in the showcase certainly looks alright to me and I look forward to finding out more info (and whether or not the protagonist will have amnesia again.)\nBeyond Project Dragon, Maekawa also confirmed Rune Factory 6 is in development. This game will feature a traditional western-fantasy setting on the continent of Adonea. I can only hope the end product is a few ticks above what we got with Rune Factory 5.\nAs with most of the games in the showcase, there is no information on a release date or potential launch platforms. In the meantime, Marvelous and Xseed Games will release Rune Factory 3 Special in September.\nThe post Rune Factory: Project Dragon is going big and bold with its eastern take on the franchise appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Because doing chores alone is dull\nThe Story of Seasons series continues to be the breadwinner for the developers at Marvelous, so it's never a surprise when there is one in development. During the Marvelous Game Showcase, we got our first look at the new Story of Seasons title. The theme of the game, according to series manager Hikaru Nakano, will be \"Experiences.\" There wasn't much footage of it in the showcase, but what was there showed the team is working hard on its visuals. While I thought Story of Seasons: Pioneers of Olive Town looked just fine, I think the direction the team is going with the new game is sharp.\nhttps://youtu.be/N4NGndJUuMY?t=892\nInformation on the new Story of Seasons is still scarce, but that didn't stop Nakano from announcing a future series entry during the stream. This also-unnamed Story of Seasons title is being developed around the theme of \"a Story of Seasons you can play with everyone.\" As the series has mostly been a solitary experience throughout its life, it'll be interesting to see how Marvelous implements the concept. I have to wonder if the wild success of Animal Crossing: New Horizons, which made playing with friends easier than ever before, pushed Nakano in this direction.\nIf I had to put any money on it, I'd wager we'll be seeing more of the first new Story of Seasons game sometime in early 2024. I am curious about what platforms the game will release on as Nakano said it will \"...reach more players than ever before.\" That sounds like code for a mobile game to me, but it could be a cross-platform experience along the lines of Genshin Impact.\nAs for the multiplayer entry, one can only guess when it'll release and for what platforms. Both games are \"diligently under development,\" according to the showcase. If you can't wait that long, Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life releases next month.\nThe post There are two Story of Seasons games in development, and one of them is going multiplayer appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "(And protects your Ears of the Kingdom)\nNintendo has released a small update for its blockbuster release The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. The new patch, which is available to download today, fixes a few issues that had been bothering some players on their adventures through the Sky Islands.\nUnfortunately, as noted by Twitter user OatmealDome, Version 1.1.2 is mostly focused on eradicating Duplication glitches, with attempts to shutdown exploit bugs in which players could forge multiple versions of some of the title's top-tier weaponry. So it looks like the party's over for you multiple Master Sword wielders.\nAccording to the official patch notes, available on the official Nintendo website, the update also fixes a strange, sporadic bug that would cause sound effects to randomly play at an extremely high volume. This has never happened to me but it sounds pretty funny. Additionally, the patch fixes a bug that caused players to become stuck during the mission \"Camera Work in the Depths\". This bug should be rectified.\nFinally, the patch has addressed general issues to \"improve the gameplay experience.\"\nDon't ask questions I guess. Still, at least the sound of Ultrahand won't blow your eardrums anymore.\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is available now on Nintendo Switch.\nThe post New update brings an end to Tears of the Kingdom duplication chicanery appeared first on Destructoid.",

The casting sees Rudolph reunited with fellow Sabrina alumni Tati Gabrielle, who is expected to receive the role of Kitana's best friend and confidant, Jade. Rudolph seems a solid choice for Kitana, carrying the sly grace, strong presence, and timeless beauty of the deadly-but-honorable, noblewoman.\nThe success of New Line's original Mortal Kombat movie, directed by Simon McQuoid and starring martial arts actors Joe Taslim and Hiroyuki Sanada, has clearly allowed the new production to produce a sequel with a little more ambition and star power. The Boys' Karl Urban is tipped to play Tinseltown star Johnny Cage, and there are still all manner of potential roles to be filled, ahead of preliminary shooting this summer. McQuoid will return to direct, given his continued enthusiasm for the brand and project.\nMortal Kombat 2 is not to be confused with Mortal Kombat II. Nor is it the sequel to upcoming video game Mortal Kombat 1, nor the original 1995 Mortal Kombat movie.\nAdeline Rudolph to Play Kitana in New Line’s Mortal Kombat 2 [The Hollywood Reporter]\nThe post Sabrina’s Adeline Rudolph bags koveted Kitana role in Mortal Kombat 2 appeared first on Destructoid.",

The listing also notes that some small edits will, unfortunately, be made or copyrighted content. This likely refers to some of the stock footage used in cutscenes throughout the Metal Gear Solid series. \"Regional versions\" of each game will also be available as alternate downloads — suggesting the addition of localized voice tracks and text.\nMetal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol.1 will launch this fall on the \"lastest platforms\".

          "description": "All aboard the Titanic Scion\nThe 2023 Summer of Streams™ kicked off yesterday with a bang (or was it a whimper) with the Sony presentation that highlighted some hotly anticipated games and reminded this writer that Dragon's Dogma II was actually in development. There were some highlights to the show, but the only stream I've been focused on this year is the Marvelous Game Showcase. Marvelous and Xseed Games are one of my favorite developer/publisher combos out there, so when they have new games to announce, I pay attention. And I'm glad I was paying attention to the stream today because Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion capped off the showcase.\nhttps://youtu.be/N4NGndJUuMY?t=1693\nOkay, so it's one of those terrible pre-rendered teaser trailers that I usually make fun of. But at least this game is happening. And why shouldn't it? According to Marvelous, Daemon X Machina sold \"very well\" on Nintendo Switch. While work on a sequel was confirmed back in 2021, the Marvelous Game Showcase was our first sorta-look at the title. A supplementary email that was sent out after the presentation didn't provide any extra information other than to say more details will be made available at a later date.\nIf you've never heard of Daemon X Machina, the game is a wonderful experimental mech action game with outstanding gameplay bookended by a story you'll likely forget about the moment you set down the controller. Even if it wasn't my favorite game of 2019, it was one I came back to often because I could always rely on it for a good time.\nDaemon X Machina: Titanic Scion is now in development at Marvelous First Studio.\nThe post Daemon X Machina is getting a sequel and I am here for it appeared first on Destructoid.",

The return to Derceto Manor will arrive on October 25, 2023 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.\nAnnounced during a spotlight on the game, Alone in the Dark will go for $59.99. And if you want to check it out before you put that cash down, there's also a free playable prologue going live tonight. It's up on Steam, PlayStation, and Xbox.\nTHQ Nordic says that this prologue doesn't have spoilers for the main story, but will let you experience what this reimagining of an old classic has to offer.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJekekI4Vkg\nStar power\nAdditionally, THQ Nordic has announced that Alone in the Dark will feature two recognizable likenesses for its leads. Pieces Interactive is working with David Harbour (Stranger Things) and Jodie Comer (Killing Eve) for their portrayals of Edward Carnby and Emily Hartwood, respectively.\nThe actors are lending their voice, appearance, and acting to the protagonists. Each is a selectable character, and depending on who you play as, you'll get a different view of the Alone in the Dark story. And this marks another game crossover for Harbour, who's also set to star in the upcoming Gran Turismo movie. They aren't directly connected, but in my own head-canon, I like to think they are.\nFor those who like a little bit of scares around the Halloween season, October is starting to look stacked. Alongside Alone in the Dark, we also recently got an October release date for Alan Wake 2.\nAs for Alone in the Dark, this reboot of the Infogrames classic certainly has a long legacy to live up to. The team is calling it a love letter to the '90s classic, so we'll see if it captures the magic again in October.\nThe post Alone in the Dark remake arrives in October, and a playable prologue is out now appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "I hope someone gets my references\nPurveyor of good graphics, Videlectrix, has announced that Dangeresque: The Roomisode Triungulate is coming to PC via Steam and Itch.io.\nFor those of you who aren't cool enough to know, Dangeresque, the eponymous sometimes private eye, is a character played by Strong Bad, a prominent figure in the ‘00s-era web cartoon, Homestar Runner. Dangeresque: The Roomisode was a spin-off Flash game that combines this weird no-budget concept with LucasArts adventure games. It was called this because it consisted entirely of trying to get out of one room.\nhttps://twitter.com/StrongBadActual/status/1661803493366136849?s=20\nDangeresque: The Roomisode Triungulate is a continuation of this concept… maybe? It will involve three roomisodes, otherwise known as a Triungulate. It will also include cutscenes and full voice acting.\nHomestar Runner sort of fizzled out around the time the internet was becoming far less interesting. However, it never completely went away. New cartoons and other projects keep coming out sporadically from the creators, the Brothers Chapman. Notably, every so often, Strong Bad will play an old game in his Youtube series, Disk 4 of 12.\nHomestar Runner was a huge part of my life for most of its heyday. It sucked me in as a teenager, and it helped inform the development of my sense of humor. I still subscribe to some of the Brothers Chapman’s approach to wordplay in my writing. I’m hoping that Dangeresque: The Roomisode Triungulate is a sign that we’re going to get a remake of Strong Bad’s Cool Game for Attractive People. I’m looking at you, Skunkape Games.\nDangeresque: The Roomisode Triungulate is coming to PC via Steam and Itch.io. No release date is given, nor if it will be of the money-cost variety.\nThe post Dangeresque: The Roomisode Triungulate is gonna have to jump to PC appeared first on Destructoid.",

That game is one of the bloodier first-person shooters out there. There are definitely some floors out there that need a good hose-down, which is to say nothing of the armor that probably stinks of rot and heresy.\nhttps://youtu.be/EGNJ4l1Jgkg\nUnfortunately, right now, we only have a teaser to go off of. I’m taking a guess here, but we’re probably not just going to be cleaning the logo off. Although, if we were, I’d appreciate the brazen approach to crossover advertising.\nIs it Warhammer 40000’s birthday? No? I’ve just suddenly been getting hit by all these Warhammer 40000 press releases this morning in particular. Maybe it’s just because I reviewed Boltgun, and now I’m on a list somewhere. Or maybe it’s just like when you learn the word “expectorate,” and suddenly you start hearing it everywhere. The Baader–Meinhof phenomenon. Internalize that term, you’re about to notice it a lot more.\nPowerWash Simulator is available for PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, PS4, PS5, and Switch.\nThe post PowerWash Simulator is getting a Warhammer 40000 crossover challenge appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Robosen Robotics has for some years fostered a fun partnership with Hasbro and its Transformers license, including an awesome fully transformable Generation 1 Optimus Prime that would change between robot and truck on its own.\nIn a similar spirit, the same team now has a new robotic collectible coming to market, this time emulating the Optimus Prime character as he appears in the new Rise of the Beasts live-action film. Instead of full transformation like the previous G1-style incarnation, this new collectible is built as a display piece that can shift between various aerial action poses, speak lines of dialogue, and respond to voice and app commands from your phone or other device.\nThe figure features 21 precision servo motors and 69 microchips. Even before mounting on his included stand, Prime stands at 16 inches tall.\nThe team even brought in legendary voice actor Peter Cullen to reprise his role and record brand-new lines for the character to spout.\nThe new Rise of the Beasts Optimus Prime limited edition collectible will put you back a hefty sum; it’s currently on a preorder sale of $699 (instead of the regular price of $899). If that's not too high a price for controlling an intergalactic hero, he's all yours. The vaunted Aubobot leader will be ready to head out on a mission to your home in the fourth quarter of 2023.",

And as someone who’s played a few hours of the game, I can say it is. \nWhile I attribute most of that to how great it feels to control Clive, it turns out there might be some tricks developer Creative Business Unit III learned developing Final Fantasy XIV’s action to make FFXVI’s combat feel even more satisfying beyond the actual gameplay. \n“For example, in boss battles, when you have an attack and you may see certain areas on the ground that light up to show that’s where the attack’s going to be, that’s something you might…",

The primary focus of FFXVI will be playing through Clive’s story and all it entails, but there’s more to the game than just the main scenario. \nI was curious about how players will get around Valisthea, especially with developer Creative Business Unit III at the helm. In its MMO, Final Fantasy XIV, mounts are abundant. You can ride chocobos, the Regalia from Final Fantasy XV, Magitek armor, and more. There are dozens of mounts to acquire in-game, and I wondered if that would bleed over into FFXVI. \n“To tell you the truth, it’s pretty much just chocobos,” FFXVI director Hiroshi Takai tells me. “In past Final Fantasy games, you’d have canoes or boats or …",

The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it?

As the name implies, this new version delivers plenty of evolved forms of Paldean Pokémon while expanding on the pre-existing catalog of Paldean and non-Paldean monsters.\nThis second expansion in the Scarlet & Violet series of cards brings with it more than 190 new cards, including 15 Pokémon ex cards, Tera Pokémon ex cards with a crystalline appearance, more than 30 Trainer cards, and dozens of Pokémon and Trainer cards with special illustrations. The Pokémon Company sent over several booster packs for us to open and see what we could pull, and those with the special illustrations ended up being the highlight of my pack-opening experience.\nYou can see my favorite of the cards I pulled in the gallery below.\n\nI was pretty happy with the cards I pulled from the packs. My favorite is probably the special Elite Trainer Box Pikachu card, which features the three Paldean starters in the background, though I also love the Pikachu I pulled from a booster pack. Outside of that, I enjoyed seeing the various Paldean starters' evolved forms, though, for some reason, my pulls skewed heavily toward Quaxly's evolution line. Outside of this most recent generation of Pokémon, I was happy to snag some updated cards of old favorites, such as Gyarados, Raichu, and Tyranitar.\nIn addition to being the second Pokémon Trading Card Game to bear the Scarlet & Violet name, it's also the second pack to come at a higher price tag. However, The Pokémon Company has at least tried to deliver some benefits to this, as each pack includes more foils, and even the wrapper of each booster pack feels thicker and of higher quality than the original Scarlet & Violet expansion.\nPokémon Trading Card Game: Scarlet & Violet – Paldea Evolved arrives on June 9.

Here, Clive meets Cidolfus Telamon, or Cid for short – because this is Final Fantasy, after all. Shortly after, Cid brings Clive to a place dubbed Cid’s hideaway. \nThis hideaway is one of the main hubs in FFXVI. While I’m not sure of its location in Valisthea, the continent where the game takes place, it looks built into a cavernous structure. It features a pub where you speak with locals about what’s going on in the world, side quests to pick up, and a music player, as well. I discover music tracks exploring Valisthea, and while these are new tracks from the score of FFXV…",

          "description": "When discussing Final Fantasy XVI’s combat or watching gameplay, it’s hard not to think about other action combat games, such as Capcom’s Devil May Cry series. And if its combat reminds you of DMC, it’s probably because the combat director of FFXVI is Ryota Suzuki, who helped design combat on Devil May Cry 4 and Devil May Cry 5. But he also worked on Marvel Vs. Capcom 2. \nWhile the DMC inspirations laced within FFXVI’s combat are hard to miss, Suzuki told me that Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 inspired some of FFXVI's systems as well. \n“There’s actually something from Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 that we took and put into Final Fantasy XVI, and that is, as you may or may not know, in Marvel Vs. Capcom 2, we had the Assist system where you could give orders to your partner in battle,” Suzuki says. “And by impl…",

          "description": "Atari and developer Sneakybox have announced Days of Doom, an apocalyptic turn-based tactical roguelite. The game hopes to subvert the expectations of those who are tired of the brown and gray color palettes of other apocalypse settings by placing the action over vibrant and colorful backdrops as you battle through hordes of zombies, raiders, and mutant lizards. \nNavigating the wasteland to reach a sanctuary will require strategy, as you must combat the encroaching mutated forces using your group of distinct survivors. Beyond the turn-based tactics at play, you must also manage your scarce collection of resources and keep your wits about you as you maneuver through the hordes of the undead.\n\nEach of the eight survivor classes features unique abilities that can be used to shift your fortunes in battle. For example, the Pyro class allows you to burn enemies and leave them with residual damage each turn while combining the Hydromancer with the Thrasher can drench enemies with water before electrocuting them for a devastating synergy. Players will need to use these abilities to their advantage and think strategically with these abilities to overcome the seemingly insurmountable odds.\nAnd, of course, with it being a roguelite game, players can expect each run to feel unique. More than 50 randomly occurring events present risk-reward scenarios for players during their runs, while more than 70 collectible items and runes can help you turn the odds in your favor in your given run. However, as you play several runs and make progress, you unlock permanent upgrades, such as party size increases and resource accumulation speed.\nIf you'd like to learn more, you can check out the reveal trailer below.\n\n\nDays of Doom arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, PC, and Atari VCS later this year.",

Battlefields are covered in soapy foam, which players can use to their advantage by creating slippery surfaces to slide at high speeds. Foam can also be used in other ways, such as to shield yourself and your teammates from attacks or create vantage points.

          "description": "Alan Wake 2 had an appearance today during the PlayStation Showcase event. And as you might've guessed, the trailer left a lot of questions. But it did answer an all-important one: when the game is coming out. \n\n\nHere's what we gathered: Alan is trapped ... somewhere. According to him, he has to write to escape. Ostensibly, that's from the cult members chasing and attacking seemingly everyone within a 50-mile radius. Alan is writing about the police investigation into the death of Robert Nightingale, one of the antagonists of the first game. Here, the trailer splits into multiple perspectives: that of Alan and that of two investigators (one of which is voiced by James McCaffrey, of Max Payne fame, which Remedy also developed). Notably, we see that we'll play at least two different characters in Alan Wake 2: Alan, of course, but then also one of the investigators, a young woman named Saga Anderson. \nThe trailer closes with the game's release date: October 17, 2023. \nAlan Wake 2 was originally announced back at The Game Awards 2021 via a cinematic trailer. This is the first time we've seen the game in action.",

That’s not coincidence, since Giant Squid’s founder is Matt Nava, who was previously art director at thatgamecompany. But while this new game is destined to draw strong comparisons to that classic title, there were some notable differences on display. First, the desert itself looks much more like a flowing sea, and the character you control like a surfer moving through the water. In certain sequences, the desert seems to actually transform into water, suggesting a mystery at the core of the game.\nIn the footage shown, we see a focus on flow movement for the protagonist as they ride across the sand and trick off of half-pipes. From surrounding descriptions about the game, we know that you control a character named the Wraith, who was brought back to life to restore life to a ruined world, while facing off against vast leviathans that attempt to block progress.\nSword of the Sea is coming to PS5, but no word yet on a release date.",

          "description": "When Marvel's Spider-Man 2 was announced in September 2021, it showed off various elements that got players frothing at the mouth for the sequel to one of the greatest superhero games of all time. While seeing Venom emerge from the shadows was extremely exciting, the bulk of the trailer showcased Peter Parker and Miles Morales working side by side to take down several goons in the streets of New York.\nThat in itself was merely an eyebrow-raising affair, but it's hardly confirmation of cooperative play. However, when Miles Morales voice actor Nadji Jeter responded to a SacAnime panel question about whether or not Spider-Man 2 is a co-op game or not with, \"I don't know if it's been announced or not, but I think so,\" that added fuel to the fire. \nYesterday, when a Twitter user asked if the speculation and rumors were true, Insomniac Games unexpectedly jumped in to clear the air. \"Nope! It is an epic single-player adventure!,\" the tweet from the official Insomniac Games account said. This seems to fully debunk the speculation from fans and comments from Jeter, and that Marvel's Spider-Man 2 will follow in the footsteps of Marvel's Spider-Man and Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales in being a fully single-player experience.\nNope! It is an epic single-player adventure!\nMay 22, 2023\nThis isn't the first time a Spider-Man 2 voice actor has seemingly confirmed details about the game without the permission of the studio or PR team. Back in March, Venom voice actor Tony Todd announced to the world through his Twitter account that Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is expected to launch in September of this year, with commercials starting to appear in August. While we are still waiting to see if that pans out better than Jeter's comments about co-op, Todd has since deleted the original tweet. \nWith a PlayStation Showcase set to air tomorrow, we might not have long to wait to learn more. For now, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is set to arrive on PlayStation 5 later this year.\n[via IGN]",

Some potential players have assumed when that window is up, a PC version of FFXVI will be released. \nDuring my FFXVI cover story trip to Square Enix’s Tokyo, Japan, office, I asked producer Naoki Yoshida about a PC version of the game. While it sounds like it’s on the way, he stresses that it will be longer than six months before players see or even possibly hear about it. I’m guessing he mentions six months because of the aforementioned exclusivity window, but he reiterates that this window expiring does not mean the PC version of FFXVI will go live then or anytime soon. \nSo for now, and presumably quite a while after the game’s release, if you want to play FFXVI, you’ll need a PlayStation 5. \nFor more, be sure to check out Game Informer’s exclusive FFXVI coverage hub by clicking the banner below.",

While most of those Quests award XP, one will give you the \"Silk & Cologne (EI8HT version)\" lobby track from Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.\nIf this sounds up your alley, you can find the Spider-Verse Web-Shooters on the ground or by exchanging bars for them from Spider-Gwen. You can also find the Spider-Man (Miles Morales) Outfit, which includes the masked Earth 1610 alt style and the Spider-Verse Portal Back Bling, as well as the Spider-Man 2099 Outfit, which includes the 2099 Web Cape Back Bling, in the Item Shop. These items, along with other accessories, can be purchased as part of the Across the Spider-Verse Bundle. That bundle includes the Mega City Swing Loading Screen.\nSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse arrives in theaters on June 2.",

The rhythm game, which tasks players with shaking maracas to the beat of popular songs, finally has a concrete release date. Players can expect to transform their Joy-Cons into maracas when the Switch-exclusive title launches on August 29. \nSamba de Amigo: Party Central's launch soundtrack already features 40 popular tracks from artists like Ariana Grande, Kesha, Nicki Minaj, and Carly Rae Jepsen, as well as some tracks from Sonic Adventure 2 and Sonic Forces.

The studio is headed up by Sean Crooks, a former Ubisoft producer with credits ranging from Just Dance and Driver to the Watch Dogs franchise. Other members of the team include developers who have worked on series like Splinter Cell, Army of Two, Far Cry, and Child of Light.\nThe team hopes its first project will kickstart a new franchise. The title is an open-world, story-driven action/adventure title that draws inspiration from '80s action and horror films. Bad Brain is using Unreal Engine 5 to develop its debut title, which will launch across multiple platforms.\n\"I'm honored to be leading this talented team of developers in Canada,\" Crooks said in a press release. \"We're all passionate about creating memorable and meaningful experiences. NetEase Games has given us a warm welcome, with an abundance of support and creative freedom to allow us to do what we do best. Our first game is a passion project that gives us the opportunity to truly free our brains.\"\nNetEase, which is based in China, views this as an investment in the Canadian game-development industry. \"We're thrilled to welcome Bad Brain Game Studios into our family and enriching our presence in Canada,\" NetEase Games president of global investments and partnerships Simon Zhu said in that same release. \"With this new studio, NetEase Games continues its commitment to nurturing top-tier talent in Canada and creating games that players love. Canada has a thriving gaming industry, and we're excited to continue to be a part of it. We believe that our talented teams in Toronto, Montreal, and beyond will create some of the most innovative and exciting games the industry has seen.\"\nBad Brain Game Studios will have offices in Toronto, Ontario, and Montreal, Quebec, and will operate using a hybrid work model.

          "description": "Since the PlayStation 3 generation, updates released on a game’s launch day, colloquially known as Day One patches or updates, have been the norm. Sometimes they’re small, squashing a few last-minute bugs, but other times, they’re massive and nigh essential to enjoying the adventure before you. \nHowever, Day One patches draw criticism from players excited to jump into the action, only to be left watching a download bar fill up. Some players with slower internet or limited access might be left waiting for hours, if not days, depending on download speeds. During my Final Fantasy XVI cover story trip, I asked the team about its March accomplishment of going gold and what the team was working on now. \nFinal Fantasy XVI has gone gold.\n#FF16's launch on June 22nd 🐺 pic.twitter.com/Vrtd3cMNW5\nMarch 31, 2023\nTo my surprise, developer Creative Business Unit III isn’t working on a day one patch, a revelation that continues to become rarer with each new release in games. Director Hiroshi Takai gave me a few reasons as to why. \nThe first is that the team is confident in its final build of Final Fantasy XVI. The second is that he and producer Naoki Yoshida (and the rest of the CBUIII team) believe the game should be ready to go at launch, recognizing that not everyone has access to the internet needed to download a day one patch in light of Final Fantasy XVI’s global simultaneous release. So as of right now, we won’t be downloading a big patch on June 22 when the game hits PlayStation 5. \nHowever, Takai notes that CBUIII is testing the game daily and searching for bugs, and things could change as a result, but right now, like in the days of old Final Fantasy, this entry should work entirely as expected out of the box.\nFor more, be sure to check out Game Informer’s exclusive FFXVI coverage hub by clicking the banner below.",

He says it’s important to distinguish that CBUIII doesn’t go into game development thinking it wants to limit a game to just one platform or company.

OpenTTD’s privacy policy has always been: we want to know as little personal information about you as possible.
