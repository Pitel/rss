          "description": "Chomping at the bit for a good time.\nThere is something to be said for trying to recapture one’s childhood. Nostalgia is (and always has been) a popular tool employed by game designers, and it is something that many modern games use to try and recapture childhood wonder. And yet, for the first time in recent memory, a new release has tried a different approach, relying less heavily on nostalgia pandering, and instead on imitating the childlike power of imagination. Lil Gator Game is not just a wonderfully charming game, but a holistic experience that will bring you back to an era you likely haven’t revisited in a long time.\nLil Gator Game follows the story of a young gator and his older sister. As young kids, the siblings spent their days playing in nature, using their imagination to create video game-inspired adventures to go on together. However, as they begin to grow up, Big Sis begins to spend more time working on schoolwork, and less time playing adventures with her brother. Becoming frustrated with Big Sis, Lil Gator decides to work with his friends to create their biggest adventure yet, in the hopes of getting her to join in. Throughout Lil Gator Game there is an overarching theme of embracing fun, no matter one’s age. It is a lesson that should resonate with many people, and is exemplary of the game’s deep undertones and great writing, despite the outwardly cute aesthetic.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The sequel to Sorath's exquisite wave survival FPS flips a slow-building, protracted struggle into a hyperdense spurt of action that escalates in lockstep with your abilities, thanks to enemies that spawn the moment you've dispatched their chums and a score that ticks down with every second you spend not actively murdering. \r\n\n\r\nThat structure is also a trap. It’s an invitation to devise an opening dance that dispatches those first few waves as quickly as possible, yet following that dance too rigidly will crash you headfirst into a bonespire. Hyper Demon screams at you to go fast - though when I asked programmer Matt Bush for tips, he suggested I slow down.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Still, I was impressed by how the game's speedy combat matched its roguelike needs, as it pushed us through even the trickiest of scenarios - as opposed to other strategy games which can feel like trudging through a sea of glue.\nRead more",

It’s a grisly co-op multiplayer where instead of brawling your way through torrents of gross rat humanoids, you and your rag-tag team are now up against hordes of scabby zombies all in favour of a Imperial fascist overlord.\nSeveral of the RPS Treehouse folk have jumped into the fray, carving their way through Darktide’s industrial world of Gothic factories and towering cathedrals. The verdict? Uninspiring progression systems and short, repetitive missions aside, Darktide still remains a bone-crunching gorefest best enjoyed with pals. Preferably ones with strong stomachs.\nJames: I was actually braced to bounce off this, in the same way I bounced off Vermintide 2 and its monotonously melee-focused ratman slaughter. Nope – I’m 22 hours in and not even close to abandoning interest in my greasy crew of Imperial screwups. I think it might be because Darktide strikes a finer balance of slicing and shooting? Like there’s more of a dynamism to horde fights when you’re switching between the two.

          "description": "When Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII first came out in 2007 as part of Square Enix's somewhat indulgent (and merely so-so) FF7 Compilation project, it was intended to fill in the backstory of one of the main game's most mysterious and spoilerific character twists. Namely that FF7 hero and perpetual mopey boy Cloud Strife wasn't quite who he thought he was, and that he actually owes a lot of his life (literally and figuratively) to the peppy, squat-loving ShinRa go-getter Zack Fair. (And if you're mad about me spoiling that 25-year-old story beat, wait until you see what they've done with FF7 Remake).\nIt's with FF7 Remake in mind, though, that many of you will probably be wondering where this swanky new remaster of FF7's PSP prequel fits into the increasingly up for grabs timeline of Squeenix's ongoing Remake trilogy. And just as the original Crisis Core was almost impossible to talk about without entering major spoiler territory for the main game of Final Fantasy VII, so it goes for Crisis Core - Final Fantasy VII - Reunion. For the spoiler-averse, I'll say this. If you don't already know the backstory of Zack and his relationship with arch mega villain Sephiroth, this is a perfectly fine action game that's received a lot of welcome polish for a 15-year old PSP title, but is probably still best experienced through a comprehensive YouTube retrospective as opposed to forking out £40 / $50 for it. For everyone else out there, though, let's get into it.\nRead more",

And let me tell you, the lead-up to a night like The Game Awards is always something else. Fringes of the Tomb Raider fanbase were getting hyped for the announcement of the next game because… well, it just feels like about time, right? The same went for Life Is Strange, but then, Life Is Strange fans have been predicting the imminent reveal of LIS3 literally on a weekly basis ever since True Colors launched, so they're bound to be right eventually. Ace Attorney stans were using numerology to predict that AA7 would finally get announced. Incredible scenes of completely baseless hype, and despite myself, I wanted to believe.\nI genuinely daren't check in on any of those conversations today, because, honestly, it wasn't a massive night for long-running franchises, and I don't think I can handle the lamentations. And, while I'll admit that my initial skim of the trailers for familiar names came up a tad short, I'm not at all disappointed, because it looks like 2023 is going to be a stellar year for devs doing something cool with a new IP while learning a lot from their older projects.\nRead more",

At the time I'd been in the market for a new – and entirely necessary - underfoot experience, so I turned to a local Carpet Man to procure said plush. In the end he seemed pleased that I rebelled against the majority and opted for a sunny corn colour.\nBut the latest Armored Core VI trailer from this year's Geoff Awards had me in a contemplative mood. \"Perhaps\", I thought, \"Carpet Man would appreciate FromSoftware's use of grey\". Even though there isn't a fuzzy floor surface to be seen, could the trailer have triggered grey's redemption arc?\nRead more",

It’s trains! \nJust as a train might be lured into a station with the promise of fresh passengers (which are like treats to trains), I have been drawn inexorably toward Choo-Choo Charles, a ramshackle joke-game about a scary train that chases you around.

There are no more opinions to have about it.\r\n\r\nMy state of peace in this area was just scuppered by that utter bastard Ken Levine, the creative director and writing lead on both BioShock and BioShock Infinite, when he revealed some of the new game by his studio Ghost Story Games (aka The Developers Formerly Known As Irrational). As observed by everyone who saw the reveal at The Game Awards last night, Judas is basically BioShock in space. The bad news is that this will put more fuel in Thomas The Take Engine, but the good news is that, if it is indeed like BioShock, we can save ourselves a lot of time.

She's also Zag's half-sister — yet another of the dozens of children, step-children, and foster-children of Hades knocking about the place — which brings me to my main take-away from the newly-confirmed existence of a Hades sequel: the title character is a really bad dad.\nRead more",

This has an unfortunate heavy impact on the system and thus the detector was added to report it to the kernel log when a split-lock occurs. But earlier this year starting with Linux 5.19, kernel developers decided to \"make life miserable\" and intentionally slow down bad behaving apps that abuse split-locks. That in turn has caused problems for some games -- so far select Windows games running under Steam Play -- and thus a new kernel knob is being added to more easily adjust the behavior...",

          "description": "Oh, Holy Knight\nLarian Studios now has a window for the full launch of Baldur's Gate 3, but ahead of that, the studio is putting live a big update for the holiest and un-holiest of knights. The latest big update to the RPG was revealed today, adding the Paladin class, as well as some other tidbits leading up to the full launch.\nWith the addition of Patch 9, Paladin is now a class option in Baldur's Gate 3. The critically over-zealous knights bring a lot of power to the party. Alongside that are two subclass options, adhering to the Paladin's beliefs: the Oath of Devotion, and the Oath of the Ancients.\nBut if you just don't like following the rules, there is always the evil option. Go back on your oath, and you can become an Oathbreaker. Larian's Swen Vincke demonstrated this in today's panel, by breaking his player character's oaths and following in the path of an Oathbreaker Knight that visited his camp.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmi-QrT9br0\nMore features are in today's Patch 9 update too. There's a leval cap bump up to Level 5, the Fly spell has been added, the Reactions system has been revamped, and there's even a ping system. Personally, I'm a big fan of \"characters who attempt to play an instrument they're not Proficient with now fail spectacularly.\" Good update.\nA critical role\nThat's all for Baldur's Gate 3 now. But for Baldur's Gate 3 in the future, there is another update: voice actor Matthew Mercer is joining the cast. Mercer will voice Minsc, who popped up during last week's trailer at The Game Awards 2022. Minsc is a returning Baldur's Gate companion, who's been petrified for quite some time.\nhttps://twitter.com/larianstudios/status/1603097534653554688\nThough the big update's here today, launch is still a ways off. Larian Studios is aiming to fully launch Baldur's Gate 3 in August 2023 on PC, after spending a few years in Early Access with a slice of its first act.\nThe post Baldur’s Gate 3 lets you keep or break a Paladin’s oath in latest update appeared first on Destructoid.",

At least I'll get some good content out of it.\nFor those who don't know (because I certainly didn't when I got that email), seat fillers are people that go to large, televised events like the Oscars or, in this case, The Game Awards, and sit in seats that are visible onscreen that would otherwise be empty.

          "description": "They run in a silky smooth 4K/60fps\nFinji Games has been a part of bringing us some of the best indie games of the past few years, including but not limited to Tunic, Chicory: A Colorful Tale, and I Was A Teenage Exocolonist. Now, Finji has just announced that two of their other popular indie titles, Overland and Night in the Woods, are natively available on the PlayStation 5. The real kicker, though, is that both of these games will run on the platform at a \"delicious\" 4K resolution at 60 frames per second, which is a big step up for smaller titles like these. What's more, those who already own these games on the PS4 will receive the new PS5 versions for free.\nhttps://twitter.com/FinjiCo/status/1602731322128187395\nIf you're looking for some nice new indies to play, or you simply enjoyed Overland or Night in the Woods and are looking to start another playthrough, it seems that now is the perfect time. These games don't have any issues running on weaker consoles or PCs, because the reality is that they're simply not all that demanding, but who can turn down the opportunity to play a game in 4K? It's one of those things that may not always be necessary, but it certainly is nice to have regardless.\nIt's cool to see huge games like The Witcher 3 get upgrades for the next gen, but I'm hoping that this move from Finji helps inspire other developers and publishers to make new ports for smaller games as well. Even years after its release, the PS5 library of games could still use some filling out, especially when it comes to indies. Plus, having the games look great and making them more readily available to a wider range of players might mean we see more people playing these indie darlings than before; there's nothing that pleases me more than seeing gamers get into indie games for the first time, because there really is so much amazing stuff out there.\nThe post Overland and Night in the Woods are now available natively on PS5 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Finally, everyone's favorite mushroom eating, Goomba stomping, fireball throwing plumber would be coming to life in a substantial, tangible way, along with his friends and the world they inhabit. As something of a casual theme park enthusiast myself, I was also thrilled to see the state-of-the-art technology Universal would be incorporating to really bring the Mushroom Kingdom to life.\nAfter the U.S. version of the park was announced earlier this year to be added as a new world to explore at Universal Hollywood, the western fans have been waiting patiently (or maybe not so patiently) for when it would finally be open. Thankfully, the wait is almost over, because this morning Universal Hollywood finally dropped the opening date for the park, and it's right around the corner on February 17, 2023.\nhttps://twitter.com/UniStudios/status/1603035780104048642\nThere's gonna be a lot to look forward to at Super Nintendo World — the theming of the world is enough to make me want to go in the first place, but then there are the themed foods, the rides (Mario Kart: Koopa's Challenge and Yoshi's Adventure), the exclusive merch, and the character meetups with favorites like Mario, Luigi, and Princess Peach. Sounds like a pretty incredible experience for anyone who is even the teensiest of a Mario fan, or even just theme park fans in general.\nI actually just visited Universal Hollywood, and let me tell you, the excitement for Super Nintendo World was palpable. You can already see a good portion of the new addition from different vantage points in the park, and plenty of park-goers were already walking around with their new Mario-themed merch. A personal favorite of mine are the headbands that have little Boos on them, likely as a counter to Disney's famous Mickey ear headbands.\nThe post Super Nintendo World at Universal Hollywood finally has an opening date appeared first on Destructoid.",

Amazon Prime Video has put in an order for a God of War series, based on the popular games.\nDeadline reported earlier this year that Amazon was in negotiations for a God of War adaptation, and now it looks like that's bearing out. The God of War series will have Rafe Judkins from The Wheel of Time on as showrunner, with Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby writing.\nVia Deadline's writeup on the news, it sounds like the series will follow Kratos after he's left the Greek pantheon behind and ventured to Midgard. PlayStation Productions will be teaming up with Amazon Prime Video to adapt the series, adding to the growing list of Sony's adaptations.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0u_kAWLJOA\nOutside of streaming, God of War hasn't been doing too shabby in the video game department either. The recently released Ragnarok just picked up a decent number of trophies at The Game Awards 2022, and it seems like the follow-up to 2018's God of War has been a highlight of the year for Sony.\nhttps://twitter.com/PrimeVideo/status/1603089353093353473\nMany more adaptations to come\nSony is keeping the adaptations moving, though. The Last of Us is set to premiere next month on HBO. And the company has series in development for Horizon Zero Dawn and Twisted Metal too, with potentially more rumored to be on the way.\nReally, there's no shortage of video game adaptations on the way.

The console/portable hybrid skyrocketed in sales, landing squarely in the top five all-time listing: directly below the PS4 (though Nintendo is poised to beat that with their next earning's report). Things are going well for Nintendo, but we also got a ton of great games in 2022.\nBayonetta 3 completely wowed me, and showed me what Platinum Games could really do all over again. Pokemon Legends reinvented the wheel in many respects with the aging Pokemon formula: and outshined a full-on generational release. Triangle Strategy and Kirby and the Forgotten Land reminded us all of the raw sticking power of SRPGs and Kirby respectively.\nBut Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is one game I really need to shout out here in this post, as Monolith Soft deserves the credit. They've consistently been pumping out bangers for years, sometimes completely out of nowhere, and keep delivering. They're one of the best studios Nintendo has ever hosted in its organization, and the team clearly gets what makes JRPGs special: including strong characterizations and worlds that are easy to get lost in.\nIt's studios like Monolith Soft that help Nintendo secure Game of the Year nominees that are actual exclusives, year after year.

I am absolutely amazed and dumfounded how Postal is still a thing in 2022, but here we are: I'm actually writing about it for the first time. They got me!

But Babylon's Fall is arguably the biggest bust of 2022, as it was released by a major studio and publisher, and failed as a live service game very publicly. While the computations are solely based on platform-specific critical ratings, for me it would take the cake as the undisputed number one loser of the year for all of those aforementioned reasons.\nIt's such a shame, because with more polish/development time, and the gumption to abandon the whole live service aspect and just make it a good game, it could have maybe had some sort of impact.\nHere are 2022's top worst ranked games on Metacritic (from worst to least worst)\nPostal 4: No Regerts (PC)\nCrossfireX (Xbox Series X)\nBabylon's Fall (PS5)\nXel (Switch)\nLEGO Brawls (PS5)\nZorro: The Chronicles (PS4)\nThe Last Oricru (Xbox Series X)\nThe Waylanders (PC)\nKamiwaza: Way of the Thief (PS4)\nBlade Runner: Enhanced Edition (Switch)\nThe post Here are the worst games of 2022, according to Metacritic appeared first on Destructoid.",

So the full game isn’t actually designed like that, that was just specifically created for that demo experience.\"\n\nHonestly, the team probably would have been better off just not releasing this demo publicly at all, and coating on the visuals to sell the game. Crazily enough Forspoken is only a month-ish away, as it's set to debut on January 24 on PC and PS5.\nThe backlash against the writing in particular has been fascinating, as the all-star duo of Amy Hennig and Gary Whitta have been targeted in particular by some folks. The reality is that Forspoken actually shares writing credits between five different people: and in an interview I attended earlier this year, Square Enix intimated that Hennig and Whitta only did a form of initial treatment on the story, subsequently handing off the bulk of the work to a greener team.\nForspoken's writing is probably the thing I'm interested in the most, as I want to see if it sings beyond the quips we've seen so far. Well, as long as there's a \"quip toggle,\" so I can survive that long.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIOZjH7EKf4\nThe post Forspoken developer says demo isn’t representative of full release, I hope he’s right appeared first on Destructoid.",

I guess that doesn't leave much time to goose up the play hour count.\nFrom there, the site will break down your games. You'll see what your most played games were, as well as those you might have played right at launch and even a spotlight on some that have seen quite a bit of playtime.\n\nI can't say mine were too surprising; Xenoblade Chronicles 3 has absolutely eaten away the hours, I put a lot of time into the new Pokemon, and Triangle Strategy ate up some time and more with its multiple routes. I'll give a special shout-out to Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, though, which remains a joy to pop into and play every so often.\nThe site also spotlights the breadth of games you've played, by days logged in and hours tallied up. It's a neat little look-back at the year.\n525,600 minutes (spent in Xenoblade)\nWhile it's nice to see what games I've sunk hours into on other platforms, there is something special to me about the Switch in-review. Other hardware are staples of my at-home life, but the Switch travels with me. I can tell when I was travelling, or when I was taking my Switch to a friend's place for Smash Bros.

Based on the news I've seen today, it seems that experience is right around the corner in the form of Lil Gator Game. Wholesome Games is one of my favorite Twitter accounts to follow seeing as they keep me up to date on all of my wholesome game needs (of which I have many), so their endorsement means a lot to me. They've been thrilled about the upcoming release of Lil Gator Game, so I am absolutely on board.\nAs you may have guessed, you play as a lil gator who is exploring a beautiful island. You'll make friends with other animals, complete little tasks like skipping rocks on the water, or shooting at little cardboard targets, and of course you can take things at your own pace to fully enjoy everything the island has to offer.\nhttps://twitter.com/PlaytonicGames/status/1602692402053058560\nAs much as I've love the many excellent action-centric games that have come out this year, the idea of not having any fail state or time limit sounds like a dream. The Steam page advertises that you can \"climb, swim, and glide\" your way around, and it seems to me like we're still seeing Breath of the Wild's influence on open world game design — which I will take as a win.\nLil Gator Game is the debut for indie studio MegaWobble, and if the game lives up the trailers I've seen so far, I think they're going to be in it for the long haul. Their publisher, Playtonic Friends, has also helped release indie favorites like Blossom Tales II, Demon Turf, and A Little Golf Journey.\nLil Gator Game is available December 14, 2022 on PC via Steam and Nintendo Switch.\nThe post Wholesome Games highlight Lil Gator Game is out tomorrow appeared first on Destructoid.",

There's some nominative determinism for you. And while most fighting games would see their larger characters only offer threat at close range, it seems that Texas is able to cause plenty of damage from mid-range, lassoing his opponents via the ropes attached to his saddle. As the father of Them's Fightin' Herds OG star, Arizona, Texas has the boisterous yee-haw! attitude, and is quite possibly someone you wouldn't want to get into a political debate with around the Holidays.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPLtUoTNEW8&t=32s&ab_channel=ModusGames\nSo, if you fancy grabbing this particular bull by the horns, then you'll be able to purchase Texas from December 19 at the cost of around $5. Of course, players who have picked up the Season One Pass will find him ready and raring to go in their roster come launch day. In addition to Texas himself, players will get a matching lobby avatar and a brand new stage — The Caravan Cattledome. I can't deny he looks terrifying, especially when placed alongside his diminutive opponents. But never bet against my gurl Shanty.

The game has been highly anticipated by Justin Roiland fans, and has at the very least encouraged curiosity among the core gamer base. High on Life is finally out today, and there are plenty of surprises waiting ahead, including the fact that you can watch four different licensed full-length movies in the game, as well as a bunch of new shorts from Justin Roiland and pals.\nBasically, there's a TV in the living room of the player character's house, and instead of just having a blank screen sitting there, the developers decided it would be more fun to create, and license, some content that players could actually watch, if they wanted to. I will say that there is something cozy to me in hunkering down in your house to watch TV while you're supposed to be out saving the world.\nhttps://twitter.com/pearsonsmith/status/1602483788382359554\nThere are over twenty animated shorts in the game, many of which are parodies of the classic TV commercials and infomercials that we know and love. Executive producer Matty Studivan said that Roiland had been wanted to get back to the popular \"Interdimensional Cable\" bit from Rick & Morty, and that the game was a way to breathe new life into the idea.\nThe real star of the show here, though, are those four full-length movies. These include the 1994 sci-fi comedy Tammy & The T-Rex, as well as 1978 horror film Vampire Hookers, 1987 slasher Blood Harvest, and we're still waiting for confirmation on what the fourth one is. You can sit down and watch a movie when it comes on, and the movies will change depending on what part of the game you're in. The official High on Life Twitter even issued a warning to streamers because some of the movies apparently have nudity in them, so I guess there's that to look forward to.\nThe post You can watch full-length movies in High on Life appeared first on Destructoid.",

But of course not. Much like the film industry, the concept of taking a second pass at some beloved (and even not-so-beloved classics) is clearly here to stay — with no sign from the cash registers that it isn't still a hugely lucrative endeavor.\n2022 contained two very extreme examples of the remaster/remake concept, namely in the form of Square Enix sliding-door RPG Live a Live and Naughty Dog's The Last of Us Part I. On one hand, we had a long-lost RPG dating back to 1994 and Nintendo's Super Famicom, while on the other we had a remake of a game less than 10 years old — one that had already been remastered at that.\nIt will be interesting to see how blurry the lines become in regards to how long is \"long enough\"? And while I have zero problem with the concept of remakes and remasters per se, it's worth raising an eyebrow at the idea that each new generation of hardware immediately requires the re-establishment of the previous generation's best-selling games. Not franchises. Games. Time — and the creativity of the next wave of studios, developers, and players — will tell.\nHere are the nominees for Destructoid’s Best Remaster/Remake of 2022\nLive a Live\nMetal Max Xeno Reborn\nPac-Man World Re-Pac\nTactics Ogre: Reborn\nThe Last of Us Part I\nThe Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe\nWorld of Warcraft Classic: Wrath of the Lich King\nThe post Nominees for Destructoid’s Best Remaster/Remake of 2022 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "School won't open until later on older consoles\nHogwarts Legacy will be taking some extra time to open its doors for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Switch owners. Warner Bros. Games and Avalanche confirm today that these three versions are all being pushed back later into 2023.\nThe PS4 and Xbox One versions of Hogwarts Legacy will be launching on April 4, 2023. Meanwhile, the Nintendo Switch option will go live on July 25, 2023. PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC are still getting Hogwarts Legacy on its original release date of February 10.\nWhile Hogwarts Legacy is also slotted to have 72-hour early access for those who put up some extra cash for the Deluxe Edition, that will only apply to the newer versions of the game. PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC purchases will be able to get the three-day early access, but PS4 and Xbox One Deluxe buyers will have their games go live on April 4, same as the Standard Edition.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AZmuZNu5LA\n\"The team is looking forward to bringing you the game and we want to deliver the best possible game experience across all platforms,\" said the Hogwarts Legacy team in a statement on social media.\nSchool's out\nSeveral studios have been grappling with launching on multiple generations of consoles. While Marvel's Midnight Suns is live right now for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, the previous generation's console versions (and Switch too) have been pushed back to an indeterminate date. Gotham Knights dropped its last-gen versions, instead launching only for the newer hardware and PC.\nSeeing as Hogwarts Legacy has already encountered some delays and its Nintendo Switch version was set to move too, the launch focus now sits squarely on new consoles. It might make some folks wary of how the project will turn out, though others may be thankful that it's not the book series' author creating problems for once.\nThe post Hogwarts Legacy PS4, Xbox One, Switch versions have been delayed appeared first on Destructoid.",

In today's New Gameplay Today, the two discuss the game's narrative, its combat and what it's doing different in the JRPG genre, and why One Piece makes for such a fun world to play around in. Enjoy!\n\n\nAs you can see, One Piece Odyssey is shaping up to be a great time, especially for pirates. While we only got to experience the game's opening hours, we're excited about the full release in January. In the meantime, read Wesley's full thoughts on this preview here. \nOne Piece Odyssey hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on January 12. \nFor more previews of some of the biggest games of 2022 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for NGTs about Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion, Inkulinati, Dragon Quest Treasures, Save Room, Pokemon Scarlet, Resident Evil Village: Shadows of Rose, Persona 5 Royal on Switch, Scorn, LEGO Bricktales, God of War Ragnarok, Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope, Saturnalia, Betrayal at Club Low, and more.\nAre you excited to check out One Piece Odyssey next month?

In this case, we’re replaying one of the greatest games of the PS1 era, Silent Hill! Join us live on Twitch each Friday at 2 p.m. Central as we endure two hours of nostalgic, hair-raising scares. If you can’t catch us live, each episode will be available to watch on Saturdays on the Game Informer Shows YouTube channel. \nIn 1999, Konami put the fear of fog in a generation of players with the release of Silent Hill. The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that's (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later.\n\n\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

For a better look at the game, check out the teaser below.\n\n\nIn the reveal trailer, a man sits across the table from a woman, holding her hand. Another person in the room calls the man a banisher, one who hunts ghosts. Then, the woman at the table dissolves away into a blue light, indicating that she was a ghost the whole time. Afterward, we get a glimpse at what gameplay might look like, with the man and his ghostly companion leaping into battle with an undead creature called a bonewalker.\nOutside that brief trailer, we got a release window.

          "description": "Death Stranding 2 – the sequel to one of the best games of the previous console generation – was announced tonight during The Game Awards. As you might expect from director Hideo Kojima, it was baffling. \nThe trailer begins with Fragile, played by Lea Seydoux (No Time to Die, Crimes of the Future), running from some kind of threat while carrying a BB (a baby in an artificial womb; it's a whole thing) in tow. We then get a brief look at Sam Porter Bridges – the protagonist of the first game, played by Norman Reedus (The Walking Dead) – who Fragile tells, \"It's time for you to hit the road and start a new journey.\" Then everything truly goes off the rails. \nGiant mecha vehicles (not too unlike the titular Metal Gears from Kojima's previous series at Konami, Metal Gear Solid). Primary antagonist Higgs dressed like President Amelie Strand and playing an electric guitar. A BB pod full of tentacles. The ominous question, \"Should we have connected,\" casting doubts on the entire objective of the first game – connecting the United States – all quickly flashes onscreen. If it sounds like a lot, it is. Check it out for yourself below:\n\n\nWe're calling it Death Stranding 2, but from the looks of it, the game is actually named DS2. Also, aside from the previously mentioned movie stars, it features Elle Fanning (The Neon Demon) and Shioli Kutsuna (Deadpool 2). \nDuring a brief interview after the trailer, Kojima revealed he and his company, Kojima Productions, are also working on another video game project and other \"visual\" works.\nNo real release information was given, though the game is once again being published by Sony. The trailer also said the footage was captured on a PS5. So, it might be safe to assume Death Stranding 2, like Death Stranding before it, will have some window of exclusivity on Sony platforms. Guerilla Games will also be acting as a support studio, and its proprietary engine, Decima, will once again be used for the game.",

Longtime Santa Monica Studios lead Eric Williams directed the sequel, which released last month. \nFortunately for all of us, though, Barlog was able to convince Judge that quitting was not the right call. Judge touched on this during his lengthy speech at The Game Awards 2022 after accepting the award for best performance in a video game.\n\n\nHere's what he said: \n\"I think it's kind of common knowledge that we were honored to go to Tribeca after 2018, and when Cory took me outside and said he wouldn't be directing the next one, I literally did quit. I quit. And he said, 'Nah, I vouch for Eric.' And I said, 'Eric Williams better be a beast.' Eric Williams is a motherf---ing beast.\"\nIt's unclear if Judge legitimately quit or if he was just using these words to express his initial disappointment that Barlog was not returning to direct Ragnarök.

The character is dubbed the “Princess of the Underworld” but given the previous game’s nod to Greek mythology, there’s a good bet that this new character has some interesting ties to the big players in that well-known pantheon.\nBeyond the intriguing trailer, there’s no word on release date or console platform plans, but we do know to expect new details on Early Access in 2023, and that the game is coming to both Steam and Epic Game Store on PC.",

It's called Judas, and if you're a BioShock fan, you'll be happy with what you're about to see. \nTo say this title follows in BioShock's footsteps would be an understatement. From its industrial sci-fi look to its first-person dual-wielding, superpowered action, Judas sports the familiar trappings of Levine's work at Irrational Games. Ghost Story describes it as a single-player, narrative-driven shooter and provided this tantalizing synopsis:\n\"You are the mysterious and troubled Judas. Your only hope for survival is to make or break alliances with your worst enemies. Will you work together to fix what you broke – or will you leave it to burn?\"\n\n\nLevine formed Ghost Story games in 2014 after he closed Irrational, only taking on a small group of designers from the former studio. They've been working on its first title ever since, though whether that game has always been Judas remains to be seen. After years of mostly silence, many wondered if we'd see anything come out of the studio; it was reported earlier this year that the team's first project had gone through a rocky patch. Thus, it's nice to see the fruits of their labor finally.\nJudas doesn't have a release window, but it's coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

We also got a new look at several previously announced but not-yet-revealed characters, including Dee Jay, Manon, Marisa, and JP.\n\n\nAn earlier leak on Amazon also revealed Street Fighter 6's Deluxe Edition, which includes the base game, the Year 1 Character Pass featuring four characters, colors 3 through 10 of each Year 1 character, and a bonus 4,200 Drive Tickets for in-game purchases.\nWe recently flew to Osaka, Japan for our most recent cover story and came away impressed with the studio's vision and our extended hands-on time with the game.

Unfortunately, the ravaged planet is now occupied by dangerous oil-drenched creatures called Devourers that Gaia must contend with as she clears the world of their corruption.

According to Nintendo, \"Players who purchased the Old Picture Book at Rodin’s shop, The Gates of Hell, using in-game currency and unlocked it with three keys will be able to access the teaser.\"\nOriginal Story, 12/8/2022:\nHot on the heels of Bayonetta 3's release in October, tonight during The Game Awards, Platinum Games and Nintendo announced Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon. \nStepping away from the series' traditional gameplay and visual style, Origins plays out in a cel-shaded art style and an isometric camera angle. It was hard to get too good a grasp on the gameplay from the trailer, though it does look akin to the Viola chapters from Bayonetta 3 – where the player character's combat actions are deemphasized over summons instead. Additionally, it appears that the main summon is Cheshire, who indeed was Viola's only summon in Bayonetta 3. Though time will tell if Origins fairs better. \nNarratively, you play as a young Bayonetta – or Cereza, as is her actual name. You can get a better idea of the overall story and see the game in action in the trailer below:\n\n\nBayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon will be released on Nintendo Switch on March 17, 2023.",

The game will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC sometime in the future, but a release date was not revealed. \n\n\n\"Hellboy Web of Wyrd is a roguelite action adventure with an original story created in partnership with Dark Horse Comics and creator Mike Mignola,\" the game's Steam page reads. \"When an agent goes missing, Hellboy investigates. Prepare for monstrous toe-to-toe brawling.\" \nAs you can see in the trailer above, it's clear Upstream Arcade is aiming for Hellboy Web of Wyrd to feature a visual style reminiscent of Mike Mignola's original Hellboy comics. It's easy to see how characters, enemies, and more from those comics could be integrated into the game with such an art style as well.\n\nUnfortunately, we'll have to wait to learn more but Hellboy fans will want to keep Web of Wyrd on their radar (especially given how tragically few Hellboy games out there exist). \nAre you going to check out Hellboy Web of Wyrd?

The news was announced via a brief animated trailer. \nThe trailer didn't reveal too much about the DLC, nor did it show any looks at gameplay. Though, given Dead Cells is a Castlevania-inspired indie rogue-lite, we likely assume the core formula will remain roughly the same. The game's Steam page offers a bit more info: A gateway to a striking castle has suddenly appeared, and an imposing warrior called Richter asks you to help him vanquish the great evil within. Enticed by the promise of new loot rather than a sense of moral duty, you strike out through the grounds and corridors of the gothic castle to find and kill this mysterious Dracula.\n\n\n Additionally, the Steam page boats 51 classic Castlevania songs, 12 newly reimagined tracks, and a brand-new storyline. Gameplay unfolds throughout a fully-explorable Dracula's castle and will feature 14 Castlevania weapons, readapted into Dead Cell's gameplay, three \"epic\" boss fights, and 20 outfits from \"Alucard, Richter Belmont, Simon Belmont, Maria Renard, Trevor Belmont, Sypha Belnades, or even Dracula himself.\"\nNo specific release date was given, but Return To Castlevania is expected to be released sometime during \"Q1\" 2023. It will be available on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC.",

New features since beta1 include: Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. A new Generate World menu which now includes NewGRF, AI, and Game Script configuration menus. Cargo filters for vehicle lists (such as at stations) to allow better visualization of traffic. Optional cargo names above vehicles in vehicle lists, to show at a glance what they carry. The ability to clone or share orders with vehicles grouped by shared orders. An improved local authority action window which now shows you actions you can’t afford, instead of hiding them. In addition, some new tools are available to AI and Game Script authors: Scriptable league tables which can replace the default scoring system AI and Game Scripts can now be modified in Scenario Editor for existing scenarios (although not savegames) (As ever, see the changelog for further details).
