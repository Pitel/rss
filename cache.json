          "description": "The video game equivalent of Limp Bizkit.\nFans of unconventional narrative-driven games may be familiar with Hypnospace Outlaw, a cool project from a few years ago that aimed to simulate an alternate take on the social environment of the late '90s internet. Though Hypnospace Outlaw will be receiving a proper sequel with the upcoming Dreamsettler, Tendershoot decided to give waiting players a more unconventional spin-off release that takes things in a much different direction. Dubbed Slayers X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengeance of the Slayer, this classic-style boomer shooter launched on PC and Xbox in 2023 and sort of bears some narrative connections to Hypnospace Outlaw. It’s a decent game in its own right, and even though it didn’t manage to ‘wow’ us, we’d still suggest you give it a look.\nThe story of Slayers X is rather fascinating, as there are essentially two levels to it. On the first, you have the premise: this is the in-universe game that Zane Lofton from Hypnospace Outlaw referenced. He essentially designed this with the help of a friend, so the experience you’re ultimately getting with Slayers X is something an immature, horny teenager would make if he was given free rein to express himself. This leads to the second narrative level, the ‘in-game’ plot. You play the role of “Big Z”, an X-Slayer in-training who is forced into action when the monstrous Psyko Sindikate attacks his town, kills both his mom and mentor, and kidnaps one of his fellow X-Slayers. He thus sets out on a quest for revenge, blowing up a whole lot of baddies along the way as he fights to free his friend.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Qualified hoorays for that, as well as for the fact that it doesn’t make especially mad demands of your hardware: besides netting a Steam Deck Playable badge from Valve, its minimum PC specs only list the likes of the Intel Core i5-6600 and Nvidia’s GTX 1060. Easily doable, for most aspiring galactic admirals.\nOnce a battle gets underway, however, Homeworld 3’s performance can start tanking, turning an initially smooth engagement into a more stutter-prone light show. The good news? You can more than double your framerates with a relatively small handful of graphics setting changes, even if some these (including the DLSS and FSR 2 upscalers) can be a tad inconsistent in their own right.\nRead more",

Even the visual novel's loading screens take the form of those two-second intermission panels that flash up to signal an anime's commercial break, complete with random characters announcing the game's name (\"Neurodiver!\"). In moments like that, the passion is endearing. But in other places, it is overwhelming.

Sadly, my computer is incapable of producing smells beyond a faint reek of encrusted pasta sauce and regret, but if it did, I imagine I'd even now be basking in the aroma of burning bone and feather, because that is what the 10 new creatures you'll meet in the Ashlands consist of, broadly. Shout-out in particular for the monster that resembles a combusting sink clog with spider legs. Very Possum-esque.\nRead more",

He's a vampire doing therapy for other vampires, while also undergoing therapy, as a vampire, from another therapist (who is a vampire). Vampire Therapist! I've been able to get to grips with a playable preview - I'd say I got my teeth into it, but I'm not that much of a hack fraud - which means I got to see some of the things that creative director Cyrus Nemati told me about in our interview in action. I remain optimistic that, on it's release on June 18th, Vampire Therapist can walk the tricky line it's drawn for itself.  \r\n\nIt's balancing on a knife point of humour, the supernatural, and sincerity about mental health, the latter using real cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT; the comments the first time I wrote about Vampire Therapist revealed a lot about our readership) concepts in consultation with licensed therapists. The preview only covered Sam's first meeting with his mentor, Andromachos, and the first client Sam treats himself - a doctor called Drayne, simultaneously self-loathing and self-aggrandising - but it gave a flavour of how the game plays. Rather than a sort of janky template on how to self-therapise, as I'd feared, when you're playing Vampire Therapist it operates more as a sort of language puzzle against different types of theatre kids.\nRead more",

But I've sampled enough to know that adding a \"Misery Mode\" to the game is sort of like upending a bucket of water over a drowning person. More misery in The Long Dark? Oh thank god, that's just what this notoriously easygoing wilderness adventure has been missing. And what's this, developers Hinterland are introducing a new predator, the Cougar, which will move into any area you're fond of and compete over territory. Finally, a bit of friction for what has previously been a stroll in the woods.\r\n\n\r\nIt's not all misery. In a first for The Long Dark, which has hitherto been a permadeath game that wipes your save between runs, the devs are working on an optional Cheat Death system. It's not as cheaty as it sounds, however. You can only return from the grave four times, and each time, you'll have to make unspecified trade-offs. The idea is to stop people backing up their saves and make failure more of an adventure or if you prefer, an agonisingly slow decline, rather than letting players avoid the consequences of their actions.\r\n \nRead more",

Second, and perhaps more significant, is an upcoming change to the way Melinoë's dash and sprint work. We don't know exactly what that change is but, according to Supergiant, it has something to do with your witchy batterer's \"distinct style\". \nRead more",

Up next, it seems, is the artist formally known as Assassin's Creed: Codename Red. All we knew about red was that it would be set in feudal Japan, something fans have been clamouring for for literal years. Now we know that it's an AC game set in feudal Japan called Assassin's Creed Shadows, and it's getting an \"official cinematic world premiere trailer\" debut on YouTube tomorrow, at 5pm BST.\nAlso, because this sort of thing seems to always happen with Ubi, the placeholder text for said YouTube premiere might have accidentally leaked the release date for the game as November 15, 2024.\nRead more",

          "description": "Former Microsoft senior PR manager Brad Hilderbrand has blogged about the recent closure of Tango Gameworks and Arkane Austin, making a familiar case that Microsoft’s gaming division are now expected “to cut expenses to the bone” in the wake of the wildly expensive acquisition of Activision Blizzard and amid slowing growth of the Game Pass subscription business. In Hilderbrand’s view, Game Pass will likely never be sustainable or profitable. Microsoft’s only chance on this front, he says, is “to put all the world's biggest games on the service” – namely, Call of Duty, which still earns hundreds of millions annually in direct sales, or GTA 6, which, hahahaha.\r\n\n \nRead more",

You briefly meet Orpheus in the base game while playing as leatherclad muse Grace, finding him moping in the underworld, eyes dripping with glam rock mascara. In the DLC he makes a musical comeback on earth, alongside messenger god Hermes. I've not stumbled on Orpheus in the other mythical game of this season, Hades 2 (he showed up in the first Hades but there's no sign he's reappearing in the sequel). So it looks like fans of the ancient Greek sadboi will have to flock to Summerfall's expansion when it comes out this summer.\nRead more",

I confess, I found this response annoying - partly because I was hoping Johanas would bring up some obscure indie composer I could then namecheck at parties, and partly, because I have spent years waiting for Tango to escape Mikami's shadow after essentially announcing themselves as a Mikami fan project back in 2010. \r\n\n \nRead more",

He used to play loads of League Of Legends, but the game he was most into more recently was Hades. This is because he studied Classics.\nI won't tell you how many years its been since he was at university, but for many years - and still sort of now, to be honest - \"liking Apollo\" was a key part of his personality.

Pro účast je potřeba vyplnit registrační formulář.\r\n\r\nNe-konference neznamená, že se organizátorům nechce připravovat program, ale naopak dává prostor všem pozvaným, aby si program sami složili z toho nejzajímavějšího, čím se v poslední době zabývají nebo co je oslovilo. Obsah, který vytváří všichni účastníci, se skládá z desetiminutových prezentací a delších workshopů s převážně vývojářskou tématikou od devops, přes datové struktury, nástroje, jazyky, zkušenosti s automatizací testů a různé zajímavosti ze světa IT.\r\n\r\nPokud chcete nasát atmosféru minulých ročníků či ohodnotit kvalitu přednášek, navštivte náš YouTube kanál. Nejoblíbenější z nich právě překonala 22 tisíc shlédnutí.\r\n\r\nCo je potřeba udělat, abyste se mohli zúčastnit? Připravit si desetiminutovou prezentaci na libovolné téma, která má potenciál oslovit ostatní přítomné. Historicky proběhlo i několik velmi zajímavých nevývojářských témat, takže ani výletu do úplně jiného oboru není třeba se nikterak bránit.",

It was April 1st, and they posted a trailer that starts off rather deceptively. But here it is. I’m not sure I really wanted to play PO’ed, but now I’ve played all of it.\n\n\nPO’ed was initially released in 1995 on the doomed 3DO Interactive Multiplayer before getting a 1996 port on PlayStation. The first-person shooter genre was still in its infancy, and while these early years resulted in classics like Doom, Quake, and Duke Nukem 3D, it’s also a graveyard for countless others that are now largely forgotten. If it isn’t obvious, PO’ed belongs in the latter category.\n\n\nI hadn’t played it before. There was a copy in one of those early-PS1 cardboard longboxes in the basement of the game store I brief…",

Along the way, you'll have to make some buttons yourself, but figuring out how to do this is initially challenging. Fortunately, you'll get some fun rewards once you figure it out.\n\n\nButton-Maker duty guide in Disney Dreamlight Valley\n\n\nCompleting the Button-Maker duty during the Dreamlight Parks Fest event requires creating 20 purple buttons in your crafting table using blue and red buttons. Below are the exact crafting materials for one purple button:\n\n\n\nBlue Button (1)\n\n\nRed Button (2)\n\n\nDreamlight (100)\n\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nIn other words, you'll need 20 blue buttons, 40 red ones, and 2,000 Dreamlight for all 20 purple buttons. Once you have these required items, head into your crafting table and scroll through the Functional Items category until you find the purple button option. You can make as you can from here, with the twentieth finishing your Dreamlight duty. \n\n\nOnce you have made all 20 purple buttons, go back to your Dreamlight duties menu and find the task to claim your cosmetic reward. \n\n\nFinding red and blue buttons\n\n\nThe hardest part of making purple buttons is getting enough blue and red buttons. Red buttons spawn on the ground outside villager houses, while blue buttons are a potential fishing drop. \n\n\nWith red buttons, your best bet for finding both is to watch the ground as you run around your village in case some randomly spawn around, especially since they can appear in any biome. If you're hunting for blue buttons, focus on white fishing circles, as these are the only types that spawn them. \n\nThe post How to complete the Button-Maker duty in Disney Dreamlight Valley appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Remember the burst assault rifle Warzone meta from a few years back? People were using the M16 and AUG like it was nobody's business. Fortunately, their incredibly high damage output was nerfed into the ground, leaving us with a few fairly useless weapons for a long time. However, a new conversion kit turns the M16 into a fully automatic assault rifle. Here's how to build the automatic M16 loadout for Warzone, which also received a buff recently.\n\n\nHow to get the JAK Patriot conversion kit for the M16\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst and foremost, you'll need to unlock the JAK Patriot conversion kit for the M16 assault rifle. Without it, the gun isn't viable in Warzone. The fastest way to unlock it is by focusing on the weekly challenges in multiplayer. However, if you don't own Modern Warfare 3 or just don't want to play regular multiplayer, there are weekly challenges for Warzone and Zombies game modes too. \n\n\nSimply complete five of the eight available weekly challenges for the current week (6) of Season 3. Once you've done that, the JAK Patriot will be available when you go to create an M16 loadout.\n\n\nBest fully automatic M16 loadout \n\n\nOnce you've equipped the JAK Patriot, the other attachments are ones you might know by now. Many meta-builds for guns use similar attachments, as they're significantly better than others. However, the best full-auto M16 class uses an alternate ammunition type, which is unusual. You can also swap out the under barrel for an optic if you don't like the iron sights, as the recoil isn't too bad.\n\n\n\nCasus Brake Muzzle\n\n\n5.56 High Velocity Ammunition\n\n\nBruen Pivot Vertical Grip Under Barrel\n\n\n60 Round Magazine\n\n\nJAK Patriot Conversion Kit\n\n\n\nCommunity testing has found this version of the M16 to be one of the fastest time-to-kill assault rifles in Warzone right now. The DG-58 LSW is still the absolute meta, but the full-auto M16 is a close competitor for the first time in a long time.\n\nThe post New fully automatic M16: Best Warzone loadout appeared first on Destructoid.",

There may still be in-game purchases, though, with premium Battle Pass items. \n\n\nImage via Ubisoft\n\n\nIf you're one of the players who already have a previous version of the game installed, it's crucial to check for an update.

However, we have yet to know what the console versions will involve. We will update you as soon as we have more information. \n\n\nCompared to other first-person shooter file sizes, XDefiant's storage space is relatively small, which should come as a relief.

Itemization is much simpler now, with the added bonus of being able to add new affixes, or stat bonuses, to items yourself. This system is called Tempering, and I'll explain how it works, why you should do it as soon as possible, and what it'll cost you. \n\n\nWhy Temper?\n\n\nRather than yellow, or \"Rare,\" items dropping with four affixes that seem overly complex, Season 4 has pared back the number of affixes to just two and culled a lot of the less obviously-useful ones from the game. This means Rares, while still useful, won't be dropping at their full potential. That's where Tempering comes in. \n\n\nBy using Tempering Manuals, which drop …",

As I've gotten older, I've tried to stop myself from doing it, but I don't blame those who do, like Doja Cat on May 15. \n\n\nIn a pair of now-deleted tweets, the \"Say So\" singer wrote that \"If Fortnite knew what was good for them, they'd get rid of the Chains of Hades,\" then suggesting that \"if you're horrible and garbage at Fortnite, make sure you grab a Chains of Hades whip to pass the time,\" labeling those who use them \"dumb.\"\n\n\nDefinitely not a fan of the Chains of Hades. Image via imalonexc (Reddit)\n\n\nShe wasn't done there though. When one fan replied, \"No, that's my favorite weapon, are you crazy?\" Doja Cat made sure to double down on her opinion, writing that it's \"because you're terrible.\" \n\n\n\n\nIt's well-known that Doja Cat is a Fortnite player, and has both tweeted about and streamed the game in the past. Clearly, though, the Chains of Hades have just been too much for her, as the fact that you can swing them and do huge damage if they connect with enemies can be extremely frustrating if you're on the wrong end of it. Embarrassingly, I pick them up whenever I see them, so I guess I fall into the \"horrible and garbage\" category the rapper is talking about. \n\n\nIronically, the Chains of Hades have now been disabled from Fortnite tournaments, with Epic only stating that an \"issue\" is the root cause. It's unknown if the issue is \"Doja Cat roasted us on Twitter,\" but I like to believe it was.\n\nThe post If you use this Fortnite weapon, Doja Cat thinks you’re dumb appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "For those players who are never satisfied with a Fantasia makeover for long, Final Fantasy XIV is implementing a 'redo' button of sorts. During the Letter from the Producer Live 81, director and producer Naoki Yoshida revealed the Fantasia system is getting some updates, and a new way to get a free potion. \n\n\nWhen Dawntrail releases on July 2  — June 28 for early access  —  a new low-level quest will be added in Ul’dah, which not only teaches players how Fantasia works but also provides all players who complete it with a free Phial of Fantasia to use as they wish. During the Live Letter, Naoki Yoshida said he hopes that players will use this free potion to experiment with the Character Creation aspect of FFXIV. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nMore excitingly, though, after using a Phial of Fantasia, players will now have a 60-minute window of game time in order to make further tweaks to their character. This means that any decisions you make while inside the Character Creator screen will not be final, allowing you to experiment not only with small tweaks but also providing an opportunity to test out other races. \n\n\nThere is no limit to the number of times players will be able to access the Character Creation menu during this time, though the time doesn’t reset after each editing session. The 60-minute window is based on game time, so if you log out, the timer pauses, and you can go away and allow yourself time to get used to your new look. \n\n\nThis change comes as a response to player feedback, with players saying that they wanted to see their character in action to fully appreciate any changes that are made while using Fantasia. It's a big change for folks dissatisfied with how lighting, weather, and other in-game effects change their Warrior of Light's appearance outside of the customization menu. \n\nThe post Final Fantasy XIV’s Fantasia system gets a ‘redo’ option in Dawntrail, plus one free potion to try appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "I'm going to be honest when I say I experienced some severe flashbacks when running the reprised Destiny 2 Exotic Mission, Zero Hour. \n\n\nIt's a maze layered with some nasty platforming backed by an incredibly tight timer on Legend. One of the biggest pain points is the Fire Puzzle room. I hated it and want to spare you the same pain; so here are the solutions.\n\n\nHow to get past the Fire Room in Zero Hour\n\n\nNormal Mode\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nWhen running Zero Hour on Normal, the pattern for navigating the Fire Room tiles changes daily. In order to safely cross the room, you'll need to check the drawing on the wall in the vault prior. It's a crude drawing, but it will do the job of helping you navigate. I recommend having one member of your fireteam move across the floor to confirm the pattern. That way, if they goof up, it's a quick revive that doesn't wipe the group.\n\n\nLegend Mode\n\n\nImage by Destructoid\n\n\nFortunately, Legend has a set route. I can't imagine trying to confirm a route while dealing with the incredibly tight-timer. Just make sure to turn off the trap once you're across. There will be a panel directly behind you on the right wall facing the fire puzzle which disables it. However, that switch is also on a timer and if a member of your fireteam is lagging behind, the trap may have reset.\n\n\n\nMove from row one to row two in the first column on the left\n\n\nMove right three spaces to the fourth column from the left\n\n\nMove forward three spaces to the fifth row\n\n\nMove left to the first column on the left\n\n\nMove up to the exit\n\n\nThe post Destiny 2: Zero Hour Fire Puzzle solutions appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Activision, the developer-publisher Microsoft and Xbox purchased for $69 billion last year, has formed a new studio called Elsewhere Entertainment, and it is developing a new \"narrative-based and genre-defining AAA franchise.\" The studio is based in Warsaw, Poland, and, according to a report from IGN, it is not working on a Call of Duty-related project. \nThis studio, which has been formed behind-the-scenes before today's public unveiling, arrives roughly one week after Xbox closed four Bethesda studios, including Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks and Redfall team Arkane Austin. While the company has yet to publicly address the closures directly, Xbox president Sarah Bond said in an interview that the closures were about keeping the business healthy in the long-term. It's why news of this new studio might be surprising, given one week ago, the parent company of Activision was closing studios to cut costs. \n\n\n\"Built from the ground up, Elsewhere Entertainment is a premier and standalone studio dedicated to establishing an environment that inspires bold and diverse ideas,\" a blog post reads. \"The team's underlying mission encourages everyone to explore and collaborate creatively to craft a franchise with an enduring legacy that resonates far beyond games. [The] new studio has full access to Activision's resources and tools as it continues to increase production and development. \n\"Elsewhere is opening its search for best-in-class talent from across the industry and around the world to help create a state-of-the-art and next generation gaming experience.\" \nElsewhere is currently made up of developers with experience working on franchises like The Last of Us, Uncharted, The Witcher, Cyberpunk 2077, Destiny, Tom Clancy's The Division, and Far Cry. \nWhat kind of game do you hope Elsewhere makes?

The game has only been available in PC Early Access since April 26, meaning it achieved this milestone in only three weeks.\nPublisher Hooded Horse announced the sales account for Steam, Epic, GOG, and the Microsoft Store (where Manor Lords is also playable through PC Game Pass). The game quickly caught fire, selling 1 million copies a day after launch. Since then, Manor Lords has enjoyed a consistently high concurrent player count, peaking at 173,000 on Steam in its first weekend.  \n\n\nManor Lords is being developed by Slavic Games and puts players in the shoes of a medieval lord tasked with building and growing a city. Players manage their city’s community, infrastructure, economy, and defense/expansion, the latter of which unfold as large-scale tactical battles. The intricate social and production systems combined with an ever-changing world (complete with seasonal and weather changes) result in an organic metropolis that players have taken to in a big way. \nManor Lords joins Early Access hits this year, such as Palworld and Hades II. The game’s 1.0 launch is currently up in the air as the game continues to change and improve based on player feedback. It’s off to a great start, though, and we’re curious to see how it evolves throughout its EA period.",

The company did so after word online spread that Shadows requires a mandatory online connection to play the game. \nFollowing the reveal of Shadows yesterday, which showcased the dual samurai and shinobi protagonists we'll be controlling in 16th-century feudal Japan, people noticed wording in preorder listings and elsewhere that seemingly pointed to the game requiring an always-online connection. This frustrated fans of the series, especially given Shadows, like its recent predecessors, is a single-player game. However, that's not the case and Ubisoft released a statement today to clear the air. \n\n\n\"Hey everyone, we wanted to share some of the early information on the upcoming launch of Assassin's Creed Shadows, following some questions we've noticed in the community,\" the statement reads. \"Assassin's Creed Shadows will not require a mandatory connection at all times. An online connection will be needed to install the game, but you will be able to play the entire journey offline, and explore Japan without any online connection. \n\n\"We are super excited to bring Assassin's Creed to Feudal Japan on November 15 when the game releases, and we cannot wait to show you more along the way.\" \n\nAs you can see, it's clear Shadows is a game you can play offline, but only after connecting to the internet once to actually install the RPG. \nAssassin's Creed Shadows hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Amazon Luna, PC (via the Ubisoft Store and Epic Games Store), and Mac (with Apple silicon via the Mac App Store) on November 15.\nFor more, check out what we learned yesterday during the Shadows reveal, and then read Game Informer's ranking of the entire Assassin's Creed series.\nHow do you feel about needing internet to install Assassin's Creed Shadows?

          "description": "Ubisoft has canceled The Division Heartland. First announced in 2021, the game was a free-to-play spin-off of The Division franchise developed by Red Storm Studio.\nUbisoft revealed the cancelation in an earnings report, stating,\n“As part of Ubisoft’s efforts to streamline its operations and adapt to evolving market trends, there have been further reorganizations within the Global Publishing teams, both at the APAC region, that is not organized into three engagement hubs, and at the central level. Additionally, in line with the increased selectivity of its investments, Ubisoft has decided to stop development on The Division Heartland and has redeployed resources to bigger opportunities such as XDefiant and Rainbow Six.”\n\n\nThe Division Heartland had been quiet for some time after its reveal, including being delayed. It eventually resurfaced with closed beta tests, but scarce updates on its existence caused doubt and confusion among fans. The game was billed as a PvEvP survival action experience with players controlling a Division agent tasked with protecting a small town from enemy factions and chemical contamination. \nDespite the cancellation, we know it doesn't mean the end of the franchise. Ubisoft announced The Division 3 last September, with series creator Massive Entertainment back at the helm. That game currently has no release window. \nHeartland joins an expanding graveyard of canceled Ubisoft projects over the past few years. In January 2023, the publisher canceled its upcoming team-based arena battler Project Q and three other games in development. In 2022, the battle royale Ghost Recon Frontline, Splinter Cell VR, and two unannounced games were also axed. An unannounced sequel to Immortals Fenix Rising was also reportedly scrapped last July.",

The game was first announced at the 2023 Game Awards. \nThe story unfolds in 1980 in the town of Cedar Hills, a town scarred by the murderous killer Frank Stone. It stars four friends who set out to create a horror film at a derelict steel mill dubbed Murder Mill. Naturally, that goes as horribly as you’d imagine, and players must survive by making choices that decide the characters’ relationships and fates. Sudden quick-time events can also be the deciding factor between whether someone lives or dies. \n\n\nSimilar to Supermassive’s previous titles like The Quarry and the Dark Pictures Anthology, The Casting of Frank Stone can go down multiple paths based on your choices.

Like Amazon's Fallout series, this Tomb Raider show will premiere exclusively on Prime Video to more than 240 countries and territories around the world. \nThis series order arrives as part of a larger deal between Amazon MGM Studios and Tomb Raider reboot developer Crystal Dynamics, which is currently working on a new Tomb Raider game in Unreal Engine 5. In December of 2022, we learned Amazon Games will publish that in-development Tomb Raider game, which Amazon describes as a \"single-player, narrative-driven adventure that will add a new chapter to Lara Croft's story in the Tomb Raider series.\" \n\"With great IP, the possibilities are endless,\" Amazon Games vice president Christoph Hartmann writes in a press release. \"The richness and depth of the fiction allows the Tomb Raider series from Prime Video and the video game from Amazon Games to tell separate stories about Lara Croft's adventures. We're honored that Crystal Dynamics has entrusted Amazon with this iconic franchise, and we're looking forward to seeing where this collaboration takes us.\" \nThis is the second upcoming TV adaptation to star the iconic treasure hunter. Netflix's animated series Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft, starring Haley Atwell, is set to premiere sometime this year. That particular show is set within the continuity of Crystal Dynamic's reboot trilogy, taking place after the events of Shadow of the Tomb Raider. \nIf you're curious about Crystal Dynamics' recent Tomb Raider reboot, you can pick up Tomb Raider: Game of the Year Edition on PC via GOG for free if you're an Amazon Prime member throughout May.

In doing so, Sony sold more than any fiscal year since the console's launch in November 2020. However, despite that achievement, Sony still fell short of its original PS5 sales target for this year, missing it by more than 4 million units. \nOriginally targeting 25 million units for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, Sony sold 20.8 million, bringing the grand total up to 59 million, despite the 4 million units miss. As noted by VideoGamesChronicle, however, Sony revised that 25 million unit target in February to just 21 million; it still didn't hit that target, though, just narrowly missing the mark. \n\n\nAt 59 million units, the PS5 is just behind the PlayStation 4's 60 million units at the same point in its life cycle. However, Tokyo-based video game analyst Serkan Toto told VGC that 20.8 million units sold is likely going to remain the peak for the PS5, and that this number would have been much lower if not for the release of Helldivers 2 in February, which is PlayStation's fastest-selling game ever after selling 12 million copies in 12 weeks. \nOn the earnings call, Sony told investors to expect gaming sales to decrease in the fiscal year that just began (and ends March of next year) due to an expected decrease in console sales. There are also no major games from existing franchises releasing between now and then, according to the company. However, Sony says it still plans to release Concord, the new multiplayer online shooter IP from Firewalk Studios coming to PS5 and PC, this year. \nFor more about PlayStation, read about how Hermen Hulst and Hideaki Nishino have been named dual CEOs of the company, and then read Game Informer's Stellar Blade review.

          "description": "Helldivers 2 is PlayStation's fastest-selling game ever, the company has announced in its latest financial earnings call. It achieved this title after crossing 12 million copies sold in 12 weeks, beating out the record previously held by God of War Ragnarök, which sold 11 million copies in 10 weeks, as reported by VideoGamesChronicle. \nDeveloper Arrowhead Game Studios' live-service multiplayer shooter sequel hit PlayStation 5 on February 8, with a simultaneous PC launch that same day, which is new for PlayStation. Its usual PC strategy sees PlayStation games launching on PC years after the game's console release – Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut is only just now coming to PC this month, for example. It seems launching on PC day-and-date with PS5 was the right call, though, as Helldivers 2 is now a bonafide hit for PlayStation. \n\n\nArrowhead Game Studios CEO Johan Pilestedt celebrated the news, noting there are more Helldivers 2 players than Swedes (the studio is based in Stockholm, Sweden) while thanking players for helping the team and PlayStation reach this achievement. \nAs announced in the Sony earnings call, we have sold over 12M units!\n@Helldivers2. A massive thank you to the community for your support,…\nMay 14, 2024\nNotably, Arrowhead Game Studios is independent – PlayStation published Helldivers 2 as a PS5 console exclusive, in a way previously referred to as second-party. However, given acquisitions are happening more and more this generation, it wouldn't be surprising if PlayStation attempted to bring Arrowhead Game Studios under the first-party umbrella. \nFor more, read Game Informer's Helldivers 2 review, and then read about how PlayStation recently walked back its Helldivers 2 PlayStation Network changes. \n[Source: VideoGamesChronicle]\nAre you one of the 12 million Helldivers 2 players?

While each of the four studios affected, which also included Mighty Doom developer Alpha Dog Games and Bethesda support studio Roundhouse Games, released a statement about the closures, Xbox remained silent. \nHowever, four days later, Bloomberg's Dina Bass interviewed Xbox president Sarah Bond and asked her about the Bethesda closures, to which Bond cited a desire to keep the Xbox business healthy in the long term, even through hard transition periods. \n\n\nHere's what Bond said: \nBass then asked Bond specifically about the closure of Tango Gameworks after Hi-Fi Rush, which by Xbox's own admitted metrics, was a big success. Bond's answer here was less straightforward – you can read it below in full: \nWhile it's great that Bond addressed these closures at Xbox, it still lacks the clarity you'd expect from one of the biggest companies in the games industry. Neither Microsoft nor Xbox, including Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer, has yet to address the layoffs and closures in an official capacity beyond this.\nFor more, read about how Redfall was reportedly set to receive a big offline play update this month before Xbox shut down Arkane Austin, and then read about how Xbox is reportedly considering bringing Senua's Saga: Hellblade II to PlayStation 5. After that, check out this story about how more job cuts at Xbox are reportedly on the way, and then read about how the company is debating putting Call of Duty on Xbox Game Pass alongside a price hike. \nWhat do you think of Bond's answers?

Continuing the Scarlet & Violet series is Twilight Masquerade, a set that focuses on the Teal Mask DLC of the Pokémon Scarlet and Violet video games. Because of that, players can expect locations, characters, and Pokémon from Kitakami, the folklore-rich area from the first part of the Hidden Treasure of Area Zero storyline.\nAs such, new Pokémon like Bloodmoon Ursaluna, Fezandipiti, Okidogi, Munkidori, and Sinistcha are all featured in Twilight Masquerade. However, the most common new Pokémon I encountered during my opening of several booster packs sent over by The Pokémon Company was Ogerpon; I pulled several different versions of the grass-type Legendary Pokémon from The Teal Mask. \nPokémon Trading Card Game: Scarlet & Violet – Twilight Masquerade adds 226 cards, including 14 new Pokémon ex cards, more than 30 Trainer cards, and dozens of special-illustration cards. I'll always love Gen I the most, so I was happy to add new cards featuring favorites like Alakazam, Zapdos, Ninetales, and Eevee, but my absolute favorites are the special illustration versions of Applin, Sunflora, and Infernape. I also adore the Hearthflame Mask Ogerpon ex card that I was lucky enough to grab.\nYou can check out my favorite cards I pulled from booster packs below.\n\n Pokémon Trading Card Game: Scarlet & Violet – Twilight Masquerade is available on May 24.

          "description": "Stray Gods: The Role-Playing Musical, a creative and ambitious attempt to fuse musical theatre with interactive fiction, launched last August, but that's not the last time fans will get to experience that modern take on Greek myth. Announced today at LudoNarraCon, the game is getting DLC called Stray Gods: Orpheus, which follows the titular character through a new adventure. Check out the reveal trailer below.\n\n\nOrpheus (played by Rent star Anthony Rapp) appeared in the base game, but only briefly, so this expansion will give players a better idea of his backstory and personality. The trailer also features Hermes (played by Erika Ishii), though their exact role in the DLC isn't clarified. The experience is roughly two hours long with six new interactive tracks and features some returning songwriters, including Austin Wintory, Simon Hall, and Montaigne, but also adds comedic musician Tom Cardy to the mix.\nAs for the plot, the following excerpt from a press release explains what to expect. \"When the curtain has fallen and the show is over, who do you go home as?\" it reads. \"Choose to reject, embrace, or rewrite the stories the world expects of you. Is the mortal world ready for the return of Ancient Greece’s most infamous bard?\"\n\nStray Gods: Orpheus hits PC on June 27, with a console release date \"coming soon.\" For more Stray Gods, check out our feature on how it was made.

          "description": "More cuts at Xbox are reportedly on the way, with some staff at ZeniMax getting offered voluntary severance agreements this week. This news comes from a Bloomberg report that says employees across the Xbox organization have been told to expect more cuts. \nThese potential layoffs would follow Xbox's decision to shutter four Bethesda studios earlier this week, including Hi-Fi Rush team Tango Gameworks and Redfall developer Arkane Austin. As for the staff offered voluntary severance agreements, Bloomberg reports that producers, quality assurance testers, and other staff at ZeniMax are receiving them. \n\n\nThe publication also reports the reason Tango Gameworks and Arkane Austin were shut down this week is that they were in the process of pitching new projects and hiring additional staff for said projects, something suggested by ZeniMax head Jill Braff and Xbox president Matt Booty during a town hall held this week. Xbox and ZeniMax chose to shut these studios down – both in the beginning processes of creating new games – instead of closing a studio deeper in development on projects. \nElsewhere in Bloomberg's report, which details an internal town hall held at Xbox following the studio closures this week, Booty reportedly described its studios as spread too thin, like \"peanut butter on bread,\" and that leaders across the company felt understaffed. Xbox closed three studios and had ZeniMax Online Studios absorb Roundhouse Games to free up resources. Braff said during the meeting, \"It's hard to support nine studios all across the world with a lean central team with an ever-growing plate of things to do. I think we were about to topple over.\" \nThese studio closures follow the January layoffs of 1,900 employees at Xbox, Activision Blizzard, and ZeniMax, which add to the total of more than 10,000 laid off in the games industry just this year. \n[Source: Bloomberg]\nHow do you feel about Xbox?

However, its release arrives at a rocky period for Xbox, which just shuttered four Bethesda studios, including Hi-Fi Rush team Tango Gameworks and Redfall developer Arkane Austin. As a result, Xbox players have wondered how safe Hellblade II developer Ninja Theory might be after its sequel's release, given Hi-Fi Rush was a \"break out hit\" for the company but wasn't enough to keep Tango open. \nPerhaps to help boost Hellblade II's sales, Xbox is reportedly considering bringing the game to PlayStation 5, according to The Verge. The publication's Tom Warren writes, \"I understand Hellblade II is another game that Microsoft has been considering for the PS5. If that ever happens, at this point, it's not clear if even that would be considered a success.\" \n\n\nHellblade II coming to PS5 wouldn't be out of left field, considering Xbox has brought previously exclusive games like Grounded, Sea of Thieves, and Hi-Fi Rush to PS5 this year. However, with the launch of Hellblade II happening in just a few weeks, it seems if it does come to PS5, it will be post-launch, which lines up with Xbox's strategy in this realm thus far. \nSenua's Saga: Hellblade II hits Xbox Series X/S and PC on May 21, 2024. \nFor more about the game, check out the Senua's Saga: Hellblade II PC specs and system requirements, and then read about how Senua's Saga: Hellblade II will be locked to 30 FPS on Xbox Series X/S. After that, read about how the game will have a photo mode at launch. \n[Source: The Verge]\nDo you hope Xbox brings Senua's Saga: Hellblade II to PS5? Let us know in the comments below!",

Even better, Mark Hamill is voicing the Clown Prince of Crime once more.\nThough we don’t see gameplay, a cinematic trailer sets up a dramatic confrontation (and likely emotional reunion for fans) between Batman, voiced in the game by the late Kevin Conroy, and his archnemesis. \n\n\nThis marks the first game to feature both Batman: The Animated Series actors together as their respective characters since 2018’s Lego DC Super Villans. Conroy passed away in 2022, and prior to 2024's Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, MultiVersus was the final game to feature his Batman performance. Following his death, Hamill had alluded to retiring the Joker role for good. However, dataminers uncovered Joker’s existence in MultiVersus in 2022 and found audio files revealing Hamill’s performance. This means he likely recorded his lines before Conroy’s passing. \nJoker is the first new character to join the existing line-up of fighters, but he won't be the last. We're curious to see who else joins the fray after MultiVersus re-launches on May 28 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.",
