Indeed, the games have occasionally been labelled as \"unfair\" thanks to moments of relentless bad luck. Thankfully, these incidences are rare, but goodness, it can feel completely debilitating when it happens.\nTake the below short clip from Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, for instance, posted on X by user @ArtistRemaining. Taking place during a race on the N64 'Yoshi Valley' track, the player takes a cheeky shortcut on the third and final lap, however the speed boost from two mushrooms lying on the bridge causes the kart to careen off the side and into the void.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Steamy and challenging seas.\nWhen we played the original SteamWorld Heist, to anyone who’d listen (and to plenty of people who wouldn’t) we described Heist as the quintessential underrated indie gem. We thought everyone should play it. We were blown away by how skillfully Thunderful Games had taken everything satisfying about X-COM-style turn-based action and made it work in 2D: the step-by-step growing tension during missions; the zen-calmness of analysing the environment and enemies and then executing decisions; the existential finality of committing to a choice and living by it.\nLike a pinged sniper shot ricocheting off multiple walls into the back of a steambot head, we were blown away by the gameplay USP – the need to manually aim your shots during battles. The 2D style provided this additional mechanical twist that would have been difficult to replicate in 3D. You aim carefully, like someone lining up a golf putt. You fire. You bounce shots from walls. When you succeed, you feel good and skillful. When you miss, you grow frustrated, and you watch as your steambot, wide open now to a counterattack from a should-be-dead enemy, suffers a blast of shrapnel that tears their jolly robot body into pieces.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The mod browser lacks moderation and lets people upload the work of others with their own name pinned as the author.

I’m tempted to look up how it works but I don’t want to find out it’s made from the luminous, genetically-engineered husks of the workers that drop dead from dehydration at the fulfilment centers or something.

Saber and Focus Home have released an extended trailer that walks you through two major modes - the PvE boss and wave-slaying frenzy of Operations, and the 12-player PvP carnage of Eternal War, which spans a range of match types. The ecstasy of dying for the Emperor aside, both give me frightful flashbacks to the early days of Gears Of War.\n Read more",

I first visited the burnt-out ruins of this zombie-infested world a decade ago and I returned to it this week to find a tree-puncher that, despite bearing the pockmarks of early access, retains much of what made it enjoyable back when the survival genre was still wearing its baby onesie. Instead of a review, I figured I'd scribble together a mini starter guide for new (or returning) players.

Still, after messing around with Sliding Hero’s Steam demo, I think this one might have much longer legs than its restrictive-sounding concept suggests.

The supermarket chain – third biggest in the UK by turnover and purveyors of ill-fitting clothes and surprisingly good doughnuts alike – has added light-up gaming mice, keyboards, and headsets to its mountain of own-brand wares.\nAsda being what it is (Americans, if you’re unfamiliar, think Walmart with less gun violence), it’s all dirt cheap as well. £17 for a full-size keyboard. £16 for an FPS mouse. Overwhelmed with curiosity, I ended up taking home a complete starter set (keeb, different mouse, headset, and mousemat) for £45, or about a third of the price of the Logitech G515 Lightspeed TKL that I’d shortly kick off my desk. Could this be a new frontier in affordable PC hardware, bringing tech to the masses in a way no specialist retailer ever could, or should supermarkets stick to cereal and meal deals? Surely the Asda Tech (real name) 4-in-1 Gaming Kit would have the answers.\nRead more",

My feelings about the series have settled back from self-righteous fury over its Pentagon-sponsored war-fellating to a quieter, regretful sense that there have maybe been enough Call Of Duty games now, and that it would be nice if we could fill that infamous late October/early November release slot with, I don't know, games about witches instead, or maybe just turn it into a public holiday and spend the week lying on a mattress regarding the ceiling. Still: I've skinned and filleted enough COD in my time to know that Black Ops 6's new \"omnimovement\" system is going to ruffle as many feathers as it smooths. The short version is that it turns you into Max Payne.\r\n \nRead more",

Show them something popular like Elden Ring and, despite its grandeur, it might prove too much in all facets. But Vampire Survivors? It's an easy sell: simple, digestible, ridiculous value.\nAll of this is to say, One BTN Bosses is from the same school of the easy sell.

Leaves flutter, rays of sun cavort through trees, and the music is utterly gorgeous. The game opens on twinkly piano and mournful strings, infused with a good dose of stirring JRPG whimsy, and soon transforms into whatever the genre of music is called that makes you want to immediately go on a massive adventure.

I dunno about that, though between the Asus ROG Ally X and the Steam Deck OLED, those who stayed their hand on their earlier handheld gaming PC counterparts do have a couple of quality second-genners to choose from. Valve’s effort manages to wring multiple performance, design, and battery life improvements out of its new display, while the ROG Ally X makes similar upgrades with a bigger-yet-better take on the original ROG Ally.\nThe only thing to do, clearly, is make them fight. It’s probably in the Irish Code Duello or something: \"Should one portable games box impugn another’s honour by releasing shortly after it, satisfaction must be claimed through a comparison article.\" My hands are bound here, folks, though if you yourself have been playing the waiting game on a handheld purchase, perhaps this little head-to-head can help you pick the right one.\nRead more",

You awake to a world of tree trunks that twist like viscera and corroded contraptions powered by luminous goop that’s stored in the balls, uh, big glass orbs. A beam of light soon fills your character with newfound vigour, which is a nice moment of triumph in what otherwise feels like a deeply oppressive rust pit, all unsteady platforms and jagged pipes.\nIt doesn’t take long before you start spotting examples of the reason Bionic Bay went viral earlier this week. Above your head hangs a painstakingly detailed mass of vents and cables, looming lifelike with dust and shadow and history. I stood and stared because I’d seen how the sausage was made, but I like to think I would have lingered longer than usual anyway. It really is just that impressive.\nRead more",

So if there's only one person in your village who knows how to brew tastier beer, and they die after being freakishly savaged by a passing wolf (it happens), suddenly your village will have no artisanal lager master. The results may be devastating. Luckily, you can share knowledge in a number of ways - by copying books, or having \"wise conversations\". The exception to this is child characters, whose pea-sized brains can't learn specialist knowledge, only soaking up basic attributes like \"manners\" from the teachers you assign to them. Well, until now. The developers for the Rimworld-meets-Crusader Kings catastrophe simulator have made kids a little smarter.

Friend, here is what driving games have taught me: traffic lights are there for regional flavour; drifting is the same thing as cornering; other cars exist to serve as bumper cushions when overshooting a turn. Certainly, nobody wants a guy whose ideas about automobiles come from 2018's Wreckfest to be involved in the school run. On which note: THQ Nordic have just announced Wreckfest 2 - a fresh helping of destruction derby with fancified visuals and newly animate drivers who flinch and gesticulate when other drivers smash into them.

          "description": "It's a hell of a thing to showcase a remake weeks after kiboshing the developers of the original game. In early July, Gothic creators Piranha Bytes were reportedly shuttered as part of Embracer Group's mad race to trim costs, following their decade-long acquisition binge. Watching THQ Nordic's new Gothic Remake trailer, below, feels a little like watching a vivisectionist parade about in somebody else's skin. Still, the remake's developers Alkimia Interactive aren't to blame for Embracer's fuck-ups, and I am selfishly happy to see Gothic return as an Unreal Engine 5 production - even if I didn't play the original back in 2001.\r\n\n\r\nSin did play the original game, and in her 2016 retrospective, she paints an absorbing picture of a dark fantasy \"microsociety\" in which every community \"has a reason to exist, a means of providing for itself, a social order, and a long term goal\". It's a setup that reminds me of my beloved Roadwarden, even as the sight of grumpy lizards slinking through undergrowth has me silently mouthing \"fus roh dah\".\r\n \nRead more",

No colons, no bespoke jargon, no tortuous subtitles like \"Gaia's B.O.U.N.T.Y.\" or \"Hyperion's Wild Rumpus\" - just the steadying prospect of a titanic quest that, who knows, may involve actual titans. The action-RPG beneath the moniker appears similarly straightforward: it's about following a plot thread through a mythological world in top-down view, smashing Ancient Greek giga-crabs and the like to obtain shinier, pointier varieties of gear. I'm sure I don't need to tell you that there's an endgame in which you farm monsters for crafting materials.\r\n\n\r\nLike Pandora opening her box, but without the accompanying tidal wave of sickness, curses and death, THQ Nordic have released a new trailer that talks you though all of this in detail.

Every level would introduce a new goo type or a twist on the basic bridge-building puzzle that challenged you to get a gaggle of gurgling balls to the nearest pipe. World Of Goo 2 pursues that sense of novelty with just as much twitchy eagerness as its predecessor, throwing new toys and goos at the player in an effort to keep you on your sludge-coated toes. That pursuit doesn't always result in pleasing new levels, though. There is a \"hit and miss\" feeling to things this time around. But those hits are hits.

Then the game public transported me straight to my desktop, and continued to do so at regular intervals over the next few hours, ranging from “just as this conversation was getting good” to “just as my save was about to load.” My upper lip almost quivered, I tell you.\nRead more",

          "description": "There’s a new version of AMD Fluid Motion Frames (AFMF) available to try, and good news for Radeon GPU owners: it is drastically, almost comically better than the original version. Whereas AMD’s first take on driver-level frame generation – the same kind of framerate-roiding image generation trickery that FSR 3 and DLSS 3 are based around – came yoked to a barrel of jittering, stuttering, and visual artefacting issues, Fluid Motion Frames 2 is as smooth and you’d like. Without compromising on the ability to deploy it in theoretically any DirectX 11- or 12-based game, too.\nRead more",

No American network is in a bidding war to import Vic and Bob or remake Bottom, and Carry On and Benny Hill are assumed to be anachronisms in our modern times, but Thank Goodness You're Here! enters the conversation with a nudge and a wink. It's a cheeky 2-3 hour adventure through a small northern town, and it's here to educate the entire world of our nation's obsession with sausages and bare bottoms.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I enjoy the militant reductiveness of this character motivation. There are sprawling underground ecosystems to discover, yes, weird plants to harvest, fractious clumps of tentacles to appraise, avoid or slaughter.

It's a juicy read for armchair designers and lapsed Overwatchers like myself, packing in analysis of class roles and the shift from the free choice of heroes to single hero picks and enforced team compositions.\nIn broad strokes, Keller summarises how the Overwatch experience has drifted away from \"player freedom and creativity in order to create a more balanced, consistent and competitive experience for players\". It's possible, however, that Overwatch 2 will swing back in the other direction, as Blizzard are now \"exploring how we can test different forms of 6v6 in the game to gauge the results\", with a view to restoring some of the joyful chaos that saw entire teams of Reinhardts charging the objective in formation.\n Read more",

Zpočátku využívá postranní časový kanál alokátoru, aby spolehlivě provedl útok napříč mezipamětí, uvedla skupina akademiků z Technické univerzity ve Štýrském Hradci ve své podrobné zprávě [PDF]. Konkrétně využití postranního kanálu pak posouvá úspěšnost na více než 99 % u často používaných obecných mezipamětí.",

          "description": "In The Time of Ninja, your family or clan that you join gives you specific buffs and unique skills making the decision incredibly important. Thankfully, you can reroll your clan at any time. We put together a The Time of Ninja Tier List for all of the Clans so you know which one you should go for when rolling.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Time of Ninja Clan Tier List\n\n\nFor the most part, you want to go for a Clan that gives you the best skills as it will assist you in all forms of content in The Time of Ninja. At the moment, one specific Clan is far above the rest, so we've put it in its own category of S+. However, after is the S Tier, of which all clans are still extremely powerful options, especially because the S+ tier Clan is rare to obtain. Those in the A Tier are formidable options that will allow you to play through most content without issue, and those in the B Tier have strengths in certain situations but overall are weaker compared to those in the higher tiers. Here is our The Time of Ninja Clan Tier List:\n\n\nS+ Tier\n\n\n\nBlack Flames\n\n\n\nS Tier\n\n\n\nIntangible\n\n\nRaven\n\n\nTeleporter\n\n\n\nA Tier\n\n\n\nFighter\n\n\nMeteor\n\n\n\nB Tier\n\n\n\nHealer\n\n\nYellow Thunder\n\n\n\nAt the moment, there are also four other Clans we know are coming to The Time of Ninja: Bone, Shadow, Soul, and White Eyes. However, we don't know the exact strengths or weaknesses of these four clans at the moment, so we can't place them in our Tier List. Once these clans are released, we will update the Tier List accordingly.\n\n\nOverall, you'll be fine with choosing most of the available Clans, except maybe Healer. But if you really want to strive for the best clan, you'll want to try and get those in the S Tier or even go for the almighty Black Flames clan.\n\nThe post The Time of Ninja Tier List for all Clans appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "In College Football 25, 4-star schools featured in Dynasty mode represent the very best of the lot. The all-star institutions guarantee stellar talent and can be fun saves for many. \n\n\n These 4 and 5-star schools share a few things in common—their programs easily attract top talent, and all of them have great starting squads that push for the Championship. However, there's a gap between these schools and the top 4 (whose programs are rated at 5*).\n\n\n10 best 4-star schools to pick in College Football 25 Dynasty mode\n\n\nA 4-star program rating means you'll still have some work to do after choosing the school. While you'll enjoy a strong start with a solid squad and excellent ratings, climbing to the very top won't be quite as easy when compared to those starting there. \n\n\nRemember that the star rating is a composite average of your program's grades and does not reflect the squad's quality. Talented athletes exist all over, so don't bank on those program grades alone. \n\n\nSchool\nProgram Rating\nOVR\nOFF\nDEF\n\n\nTexas Longhorns\n4.5\n88\n87\n89\n\n\nOregon Ducks\n4.5\n89\n89\n89\n\n\nOklahoma Sooners\n4.5\n87\n86\n89\n\n\nFlorida State Seminoles\n4\n87\n89\n87\n\n\nClemson Tigers\n4.5\n87\n86\n89\n\n\nTexas A&M Aggies\n4\n88\n90\n87\n\n\nLSU Tigers\n4.5\n86\n87\n86\n\n\nAuburn Tigers\n4\n84\n82\n86\n\n\nWisconsin Badgers\n4\n86\n86\n86\n\n\nNorth Carolina Tar Heels\n4\n84\n84\n85\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI really like the fact that despite having great program ratings and squads, most of the 4-star schools still offer some challenges. The Auburn Tigers might have a good program rating, but their squad has a lot of room for improvement. On the other hand, schools like Oregon Ducks and Texas Longhorns could match the best 5-star schools on the field. \n\n\nDo note that there are a few other schools on the roster with 4-star rating, but I really like these ten as the best candidates for a potential Dynasty mode save in College Football 25. \n\nThe post 10 best 4-star schools for College Football 25 Dynasty mode appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Publisher Hooded Horse and developer Long Jaunt have released a road map for their noble house simulation game, Norland. The plans stretch from now until October, outlining what will be added to the Early Access title.\n\n\nThis month will have focus on optimization, graves, and archers. September is more optimization, ranged towers, and “unique guests.” Finally, October is when we’ll see city walls and gates, barons, and usurpers.\n\n\nI’m not sure how barons will come into play, but another tier of noble would definitely be appreciated. Usurpers sound interesting since Norland’s big gameplay hook is a Rimworld-like system of generation where stories develop from a chaotic interplay of the game’s mechanics.\n\n\nImage via Long Jaunt\n\n\nI previewed Norland before its Early Access launch. I found that it suffered heavily from a lack of balance and progression. I wasn’t alone, as the Steam reviews show that it has a 77% positive “Mixed” rating. However, the developers have taken community feedback and made significant changes over a vast number of patches and updates (they’re on patch 17). I haven’t jumped back in to see how it affects my opinion of the game, since I want to let it marinate for a bit, but I have seen some of the issues I had with it get adjusted.\n\n\nIt’s hard to say if Norland will eventually become recommended playing – and city walls aren’t going to be the fix it needs – but the developers are clearly listening and putting in the work to get it in shape. And to be clear, it isn’t that bad, it just isn’t where it needs to be. The core concept of Crusader Kings meets Rimworld is a tantalizing one, and there are some great ideas found in the execution, so hopefully, it won’t be long before it reaches its potential.\n\n\nNorland is available now for PC via Steam Early Access.\n\nThe post Noble simulation Norland outlines upgrades with Early Access roadmap appeared first on Destructoid.",

This is the only place where you can get this upgrade option. To go to the Los Santos Car Meet, players need to purchase an LS Car Meet membership which costs $50,000. This price has to be paid in order to gain access to Hao’s Special Works mod shop. Furthermore, you need to pay $200,000 to install Drifting Tuning to your vehicle.\n\n\nPlayers can also remove Drift Tuning from their vehicle at any time by paying $50,000 more, but remember that you would have to pay $200,000 to get it reinstalled again. The Drift Tuning upgrade is available for free at the LS Car Meet for GTA+ members.\n\n\nYou can install Drift Tuning on select vehicles only in GTA Online, and these are the following vehicles that are compatible with the Drift Tuning upgrade:\n\n\n\nAnnis Euros\n\n\nAnnis Remus\n\n\nAnnis ZR350\n\n\nDeclasse Drift Tampa\n\n\nDeclasse Drift Yosemite\n\n\nDinka Jester RR\n\n\nFathom FR36\n\n\nKarin Futo GTX\n\n\n\nAll of these vehicles are available to purchase in GTA Online, with some available in Southern S.A.
