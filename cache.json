          "description": "Ready to play the reaper's game?\nDespite all the innovation that frequently takes place in the indie space, there’s an awful lot of games that are content to just do what’s already been done. It can be easy to become jaded, then, when a lot of these copycat games turn out to be worse than their clear inspiration. After all, who wants to waste their time playing a weak approximation of a better game? However, every now and then a game like Death's Door comes along. Death’s Door is a game that you’ve probably played before — and we don't just mean on other platforms where it's been available for months. Developer Acid Nerve doesn’t do anything new per se, yet delivers a tremendously well-designed experience that shows true mastery of the mechanics and genres it was inspired by, making for a game you won’t want to miss.\nDeath’s Door begins by placing you in the role of an adorable little crow who works as a Reaper at the Reaping Commission Headquarters, a Kafkaesque bureaucracy which is responsible for administrating the process of death. Every now and then there are beings that refuse to die, and these special cases are where Reapers like your character are dispatched to kill them and collect their souls. However, a Reaper is temporarily made mortal while on a mission, and they only regain their immortality status once the soul they were assigned is successfully brought back. This usually isn’t a problem, until someone intervenes in your character’s first assignment and casts your target soul behind the eponymous Death’s Door. To open it and retrieve your soul, you have no choice but to track down the owners of the three Giant Souls and kill them so you can win back your immortality.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Sometimes it can be all too overwhelming to figure out what parts are good for a fast computer, but don't worry - we're here to help. \nWD - or, Western Digital - have been on a crusade to rival Samsung's computer bits for a while now, and may have finally achieved it with this SSD. In layman's terms, it will kick your computer into super speed, running games and operating system super fast and quick like. This particular SSD supports the PCle 4.0 standard, allowing for much faster read and write speeds than the older 3.0 interface. As Katharine found in her WD SN850 review, this drive is also both faster and cheaper than its big PCIe 4.0 rival, the Samsung 980 Pro.\nThis performance comes at a price, as you've probably noticed, it's Black Friday week - and the SN850 is on sale. There's no better time to pick up this speed booster for your PC, and this particular deal even includes a heatsink, to help prevent thermal throttling.\n Read more",

          "description": "I've always found it hard to get excited about the Men Of War series. This is admittedly partly down to the name. Short of outright calling your game \"War\", Men Of War is about as generic a title as you can get for a video game. And I think this was at least partly reflective of the games behind it. Men Of War has generally delivered dependable real-time tactics games, but the series has never excited me in the way that, say, Relic's Company Of Heroes does.\nSo it's a promising sign that, at the end of Best Way's demonstration of the just-announced Men Of War II, I came away keen to play it. Not only does it look slicker and more user friendly than earlier games (without compromising on the depth that appeals to the series' core fanbase) there are a couple of ideas it’s playing with that lodged themselves in my mind like chunks of grenade shrapnel.\nRead more",

Partly because it’s not a Friday in any meaningful sense; what feels like a majority of deals start at least a fortnight in advance and continue well into the following week, an almost month-long commerce safari. The best Black Friday deals? Uncountable, not for lack of trying.\r\n\n\r\nI have mixed feelings about it, clearly. I get why some people hate it. But I like having better computer stuff, and I like not having to spend as much money to get it. They’ve kind of got me over a barrel here. Still, while I’d never begrudge anyone climbing above the bottom layers of the ol’ Maslow’s hierarchy, it’s worth making sure that you’re only buying the things you want – not the things a big red “percentage figure off!” sticker makes you think you want. With that in mind, I asked around the RPS crew whether there’s anything specific they’re keeping an eye out for this Black Friday.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's the week in November when the sky grows dark, the ground trembles underfoot, and wallets are busted open in the never-ending search for the biggest and best Black Friday deals.

Special banshee-like screechers are primed to alert their undead brethren to the presence of any would-be intruders, prompting an unending wave of decaying meat to fling itself at you, all teeth and claws.\r\n\n\r\nSo this mission requires more finesse. You need to use all that agility and poise you’ve mastered in Dying Light 2’s impressive parkour 'n' puching open-world city, sure, but you also need to layer more skills on top of that, cherry-picked from the new toolkit Techland has provided.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Truly, a timeless classic of clicks and scrolls.\r\n\n\r\nOf course, the G502 has come in a few different flavours, but you can now get one of the most recent models at the lowest price it’s ever been (at least in the UK). Amazon has the Logitech G502 SE Hero for £34: an entire pound less than the standard G502 Hero has ever dipped to, most recently during Prime Day 2021. \r\n\n\r\nUS denizens aren’t missing out either, as the G502 SE Hero is $33 at Best Buy in their own Black Friday sale. That’s not quite as cheap as its all-time low of $28, but its still a very good price on a very good mouse. The G502 SE Hero is essentially the classic G502 Hero with some white go-faster stripes – there’s been no funny business making adverse changes to keep the costs down. \r\n \nRead more",

According to Katy Kaszynski, senior producer at Amazon Games, the team got really far down that road. \"They created it. That was before my time, but that game was almost done,\" Kaszynski tells me, just after delivering a presentation on New World's development at this year's Develop Conference in Brighton. \"They really thought it was going to go alpha, launch, and they were going to ship that out.\"\nA survival horror is pretty different from the jaunty, vaguely piratical, magical fantasy RPG that New World is today: lush forests, sunny grassy plains, and factions engaged in an endless war for territory. So what happened? According to Kaszynski, it's all down to Amazon's first 'Leadership Principle': Customer Obsession.\nRead more",

As you rotate, prod and investigate its five little vignettes to line-up matching bits of scenery in one tile to affect the corresponding bit in another, Optillusion's debut game harks back to the best bits from Fireproof Studios' The Room series. It's a beautifully crafted little thing, and it builds on its ideas to create some genuinely standout moments of optical wizardry.

It's a third-person puzzle adventure. You gather the evidence, cross reference it all, and then come to a conclusion on the case. Young Holmes returned to Cordona to find out how his mum died a decade ago, and is helped by his best mate Jon, this season's Creepy Watson. Boy, do they get in some scrapes along the way! Bingo, bango, there's yer preamble.\nBut the complex explanation is that this game, ironically, defies explanation. As I played, I oscillated wildly between thinking, \"This is Frogwares' world and we're all just living in it!\" and, \"What is even happening, what is this, I need a ten-part documentary series that just follows the developers around because they really have a lot of explaining to do.\"\nRead more",

What started out as a free flash game (and a makeshift telegraph key made out of a clothes peg) now has proper 3D graphics, a full team of developers behind it called Aljo Games, and quite possibly the most impressive custom controller setup I've ever seen. When I played the demo at EGX 2021 last month, not only had creator Alex Johansson made an entire telegraph machine for the occasion (together with custom controller designer Katy Marshall), but he'd also managed to source a pair of headphones from the 1930s to really hammer home the idea of being a wartime telegraph operator. \nObviously, you don't need a pair of 90-year-old headphones to enjoy playing Morse. A modern headset will do just as well. You also don't technically need the telegraph machine either, as there's an onscreen button interface you can click with your mouse. But let me tell you, pressing those morse code buttons in-game wasn't half as immersive as tapping out the commands on a proper dedicated machine, and I wish there was some way Morse could give everyone that experience when it finally launches in full.\nRead more",

You might expect that a second Sker-y game would follow a similar formula. Nope. This weekend, the developers announced Sker Ritual, a co-op shooter in which you'll need to survive an onslaught of ghouls.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's a simple ye olde setting, no magic or wizards, but also has no main quests to bog you down.

No matter how much you try and tell me about the sweet satisfaction you feel after finally beating a boss on the 57th attempt, I've come to realise I simply don't have the time or the patience to see it through. I'm not sure I ever will, either. \nIt's the same reason I tend to veer away from a lot of other Soulslike games as well. I never really got on with Dead Cells, for instance, and don't even get me started on Sekiro. But cor, I do also love it when a game proves me wrong. Hollow Knight was the first Soulslike to rekindle my rather begrudging relationship with these games, and now I've fallen hook, line and sinker for Death's Door, the crow reaper sword 'em up from Titan Souls creators Acid Nerve. \nRead more",

Of course, thanks to Xbox’s backward compatibility features, anyone with an Xbox Series X/S or Xbox One can download and play all four of these games. \nThe Escapists 2 is a game about, well, escaping... be it from snowy tundras to deserts and more. You and up to three friends can team up to escape from some of the toughest prisons in the world, and you can do so by following the rules, learning the routines, and discovering the best ins and outs of each l…",

Other than that, details are scant other than Harmonix games like Rock Bank will continue to stay up and running, though expect the developer to leverage its talents in Fortnite sometime in the future musical talents as well.\nEpic has, of course, been dipping its toes into interactive concerts and musical performances in recent years, and that trend will undoubtedly continue and expand with a team like Harmonix under its umbrella. If any team can top what Epic has done with experiences like last summer's Ariana Grande performance, Harmonix would be the group to do it. \nDoes this make you hopeful for more dedicated music games, or are you potentially excited for more rhythm content in Fortnite? Give us your thoughts on the Harmonix acquisition in the comments below.",

          "description": "Nintendo and Illumination announced that Chris Pratt would voice Mario in the upcoming Mario movie exactly two months ago. In those eight weeks, the conversation around this choice has focused on the accent of the famous plumber. Will he be doing the traditional Mario accent, or will he do something else?\nIn a new interview with TooFab, Mario movie co-producer Chris Meledandri has defended Pratt’s casting, calling his voice for Mario phenomenal. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\n“All I can tell you is the voice that he’s doing for us, and Mario, is phenomenal,” Meledandri told TooFab. “Yeah, I can’t wait for people to hear it.”\nTooFab asked the producer about the decision to cast Pratt, someone who isn’t Italian, as the Italian plumber. Meledandri said he’s an Italian American and understands some of the feelings people have over the casting choice. He said Charlie Day, who is Italian, being cast as Luigi, is this movie’s nod to the Italian background of the famous plumber duo. \nHowever, Meledandri adds that you can expect the Mario movie to touch on the Italian accent, or rather, lack thereof. \n“We cover it in the movie,” he said. “So, you’ll see we definitely nod to that.” \nMeledandri also said that you should not expect Pratt’s performance to lean too much into the “It’s a-me, Mario!” side of the character, popularized by Charles Martinet, who’s been the voice of Mario for decades. \nWhile waiting to hear Pratt’s Mario, check out the full cast list for Illumination’s Mario movie.\n[Source: TooFab]\nWhat do you hope Pratt’s Mario sounds like?

          "description": "With it being Xbox’s 20th anniversary this year, the company has done a lot to commemorate the special milestone. There’s the limited edition Adidas shoes, the fancy Halo Xbox Series X, and more. Now, there’s a digital Xbox museum you can peruse through, too. \nGetting there is quite simple – head to museum.xbox.com. We highly recommend signing in because doing so will create a museum space unique to you that features information about your history with Xbox as a brand, your achievements, and more. That’s not all, though. Within the museum are multiple other sections for your metaverse-like avatar to visit: the original Xbox, the Xbox 360, the Xbox One, the Xbox Series X/S, and a Halo section. \nAs you walk through each museum section using your keyboard, you can place your 3D avatar into yellow circles on the ground. These circles are found in front of museum exhibits and once in the circle, you can interact with the exhibit to learn more. For example, in the original Xbox space, there’s a circle in front of an exhibit with the title “Bill Gates and The Rock join forces to unveil Xbox.” Upon interacting with this exhibit, you’ll be taken to an interactable story that features information about this unveiling, a video of the event, and more. \nThat’s what each of the digital exhibits is like, too, and it seems like making your way through the entire museum would take hours. It’s quite an expansive lineup of information, not to mention it features your own personal history with Xbox in a section as well. \nHead to museum.xbox.com to tour through the exhibit yourself and then catch up on some of Game Informer’s Halo Infinite coverage – it’s Halo’s 20th birthday too this year, after all. After that, check out these Xbox 360 Adidas sneakers and then take a look at this new Halo Xbox Elite controller. \nWhat’s your favorite Xbox memory? Let us know in the comments below!",

          "description": "When the PlayStation 5 was first revealed last year, the console design was polarizing. On one end of the spectrum, PlayStation fans were excited about the new futuristic, sleek look. In contrast, other consumers were not as impressed, namely in regards to the white faceplates. Once the next-gen console launched, third-party companies began producing different colored faceplates, with black being one of the most popular options on the market. Sony, for the most part, legally brought an end to those competitors. And now, the entertainment conglomerate has been granted its own patent for official PS5 faceplates. \nAccording to GameSpot, the patent is listed as a “Cover for Electronic Device” and comes paired with a few mock-up sketches of the PlayStation 5. The text within the patent claim mentions a “Skin cover for PS5 console” and “the ornamental design for a cover for an electronic device.” \nOf course, this doesn’t immediately equate to a future where Sony-labeled faceplates might be sold at your local electronic establishments. For all we know, nothing will come of this. But it’s nice to imagine a new look for the PlayStation 5. Only time will tell what this patent means for the console’s aesthetic. \nDo you think this is simply Sony cornering the market without the intention of actually releasing faceplates? Or are we going to see this patent put to use? Throw down your theories in the comments below! \n[Source: GameSpot]",

As reported by GameSpot, it’s not that Reeves isn’t a fan of Mortal Kombat – he just thinks John Wick and Neo don’t belong. \n“If it was up to me? No, Mortal Komat is awesome in so many ways, but I think...you know, Neo, John Wick, they’re doing their own thing,” Reeves told Esquire. “Mortal Kombat is doing their own thing.” \nLook, Reeves certainly knows these characters more than us Internet folks who want to see Neo lean back to dodge Scorpion’s infamous “get over here” chain attack, but c’mon, no to John Wick as well? That character is a trained assassin that has killed anyone in his way – surely Sub-Zero doesn’t stand a chance. \nRegardless, there might still be a chance despite what Reeves says. As noted by GameSpot, Mortal Kombat and its developer NetherRealm are owned by Warner Bros. which is the same company that owns The Matrix franchise...so the possibility is there. In fact, Game Informer reported in 2019 that series creator Ed Boon said NetherRealm was “pretty close” to adding Neo to Injustice 2. \nSpeaking of Injustice 2, check out our thoughts on the DC fighter in Game Informer’s Injustice 2 review and then read Game Informer’s Mortal Kombat 11 review.

          "description": "The Game Boy-like device known as the Analogue Pocket will finally ship out in three weeks. \nMore specifically, the first batch of devices will begin shipping on December 13 and orders are expected to reach customers sometime between December 14 and December 30. This news comes after multiple delays for the Pocket, most of which occurred due to ongoing shipping struggles and chip shortages due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. \nIf you preordered the Pocket, you should have received an email already from Analogue that states the Pocket will ship in three weeks. That email also includes information about delaying your order should you be out of town for the holidays when it’s delivered. \n“We understand that some of you will be away during the holiday season and would prefer delivery in the new year,” Analogue’s announcement reads. “With this in mind, we are offering to hold your package over the holiday period and start shipping on January 3. If you cannot accept delivery between December 14 and December 30, you should request a hold for your order.”\nThe final date to change your order is November 28, and Analogue says no changes can be made following that. The email you’ve received includes more instructions on how to go about those changes, if necessary. While waiting for your Pocket to ship, check out the various features it includes and the accessories that go with it.\nAre you getting an Analogue Pocket next month?

          "description": "Kojima Productions is opening a new California-based business division that will focus on movies and television. \nIt’s no secret that Kojima, the famed game director behind the Metal Gear Solid series and Death Stranding, is a fan of movies and TV. All it takes is one glance at his Instagram feed to realize that. His primary focus has always been games, but it seems his studio, Kojima Productions, is preparing for a shift to other entertainment mediums. \n“Today, I can finally confirm that Kojima Productions will be opening a new business division in California, USA,” division lead Riley Russell writes in a press release. “The new division will be tasked with working with creative and talented professionals in television, music, and film, as well as the more familiar games industry. The team has as its charter, the goal of expanding the reach and awareness of the properties now under development at Kojima Productions, and to make them even more a part of our popular culture.” \nKojima Productions business development manager, Yoshiko Fukuda, says this new division will take the studio into new sectors to develop narratives beyond video games. \nAs for what to expect first from this business division, that’s unclear, although Russell does mention that it will focus on expanding narratives outside of games based on games currently in development at the studio. Perhaps it’s cooking up a Death Stranding TV series, or maybe a film based on some game the studio is working on that hasn’t even been announced yet. Only time will tell. \nWhile waiting to learn more, check out Game Informer’s thoughts on Death Stranding and then read this story about why Death Stranding Director’s Cut is worth another trek across America. \nAre you excited about a possible movie or TV series from Kojima?

We're knee-deep in the Prime era now, and we're tackling Samus' sophomore 3D outing, Metroid Prime 2: Echoes. \nThis sequel to the acclaimed Metroid Prime was released November 15, 2004 in the U.S. and upped the ante with Zelda-style dark world/light world exploration. Players traverse two versions of a labyrinthine map, solving puzzles that opened paths in the opposite dimension and enduring the damaging effects of the dark world. Samus faces off against Dark Samus for the first time, one of a series of challenging boss encounters that cemented Echoes as the most challenging entry in the Prime series – for better or worse. \nJoin hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and Nintendo Ambassadors/Metroid fanatics Ky and Kyle Parker (@CaptDangerous64, @admiralboogaloo) for the next hour as we explore Metroid Prime 2's lore, development history, and lasting impact. \nIf you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com.

We'll see you on December 8, Spartans.\" The tweet was followed by a map of release times for regions across the world. Well, specifically when the campaign releases.\nForgoing the typical midnight release, Halo Infinite's single-player campaign will see the light of day (literally), landing at 10 a.m. Pacific on December 8. Other release times for various time zones can be seen below, although note that New York should say EST and has not moved into the Central time zone.\nOf course, if you want to play Halo Infinite right now, you can! The multiplayer section of the game is available right now on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC, and is free to play. After a somewhat surprise launch on Monday as part of Microsoft's Xbox 20th anniversary celebration, 343 Industries unleashed an open beta of Halo Infinite on the gaming public.\nWe discuss our time with the multiplayer beta on this week's Game Informer Show, but that's not all! Halo Infinite is gracing the current cover of Game Informer, where we have pages upon pages of information about the game. It's technically also the first place Halo Infinite went gold.

However, poor reception from consumers has spurred Rockstar to make the originals available through the Rockstar Store.\nIn an announcement on its website, the developer explained the decision saying, \"The updated versions of these classic games did not launch in a state that meets our own standards of quality, or the standards our fans have come to expect.\" Owners of the PC edition of the remaster through the Rockstar Store are being taken care of. Rockstar says, \"We will be adding the classic PC versions of Grand Theft Auto III, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, and Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas back to the Rockstar Store shortly as a bundle. Additionally, everyone who has purchased Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition for PC from the Rockstar Store through June 30, 2022, will receive these classic versions in their Rockstar Games Launcher library at no additional cost.\"\nWhile this make-good takes care of specific PC gamers, there's no word on those who own the package on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, or other PC storefronts. Rockstar does say it's committed to fixing the issues with GTA: The Trilogy stating, \"We have ongoing plans to address the technical issues and to improve each game going forward,\" and, \"A new Title Update is on the way in the coming days for all versions of Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition that will address a number of issues.\"\nLast week on Twitch, Andrew Reiner and I explored GTA: The Trilogy for a few hours, and while I had a pretty good time waxing nostalgic with the series, I was fairly put off by some of the graphical changes.

The fast-paced action RPG sports heavy Dark Souls vibes and was slated to launch on December 7. Unfortunately, that will no longer be the case because Thymesia is now arriving sometime in 2022.\nDeveloper OverBorder Studio states it wants to make sure Thymesia is razor-sharp for its big debut, so it's leaving it in the oven for a while longer. On the bright side, it announced the game is headed to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S after only confirming PC in the past.\nThymesia stars Corvus, a plague doctor who’s half-man, half-raven. He’s on a mission to regain his lost memories while also slaying abominations lurking within his gloomy kingdom. Combat is fast-paced and punishing, emphasizing aggression and mobility thanks to a swift dodge maneuver. Corvus can extract diseases from foes, then transform them into weapons such as a scythe or sword. He can also utilize his raven form to unleash dagger-like feathers. You can mold Corvus to your liking thanks to multiple character builds, as well as different endings to encourage replayability. Check out the original announcement trailer below.\nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\n\nWhat do you think of Thymesia?

          "description": "Loop Hero ranks among the year’s best PC exclusives, and we found out it was making its move to consoles, namely Switch, during August’s Nintendo Indie World Showcase. If you’ve been waiting to try your hand at the looping adventure or simply want to take it on the go, December 9 is the date to look out for.\nFor those unfamiliar with Loop Hero, it has a unique premise. To save the world from destruction, a hero roams a looping track filled with monsters and other hazards. However, you don’t control your hero directly; instead, you create the world in which he’ll explore. By strategically placing a variety of creatures, terrain types, and obstacles, your auto-moving hero grows stronger with every baddie slain. The key is to throw just enough at the hero to increase its strength without accidentally overwhelming them and causing their demise. In between runs, you'll build up a settlement with different shops to unlock equipment and buffs to increase your odds for the next loop.\nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nLoop Hero is one of those titles best played yourself to truly understand its hooks. In our review of the PC version, we scored the game an 8.5 out of 10. Reviewer Dan Tack noted that “Loop Hero is a creative and clever little game that should be on your radar if you enjoy strategy, RPGs, deckbuilders, roguelikes, or all of the above. While its novelty begins to wither the further you get away from your opening hours, the journey is worthwhile and engaging.”\nLoop Hero is priced at $14.99 but you can pre-order it on the eShop now for a 10% discount ($13.49).",

It also requires more capital and time, hence the delay. \n“It became clear that recreating these true stories at a high quality was going to require more people, capital, and time than we had,” Victura CEO Peter Tamte said in the delay announcement. “Doubling our team is just one of the many things we’re doing to make sure Six Days in Fallujah brings new kinds of tactical and emotional depth to military shooters.” \nAtomic Games attempted to release a game set during the Battle of Fallujah way back in 2009. However, the project was rightfully criticized for the developer’s decision to alongside the CIA to publish the game, with many calling it propaganda. Ultimately, Atomic Games’ project was re-revealed back in February with news that Victura and Highwire Games were helming the Fallujah-centric game instead. \nThe studio said around the announcement that the team had spent over three years building unique technology to overhaul the game and its mechanics. It also revealed that it hopes to go beyond simply presenting another shooter and instead show the realities of war and its consequences. However, the re-reveal was criticized much in the same way the first attempt at this game was. \nOnly time will tell what the final product turns out to be, but now we know it’s not coming until at least Q4 of next year. \nWhile waiting for that, check out Game Informer’s coverage of the original 2009 reveal and then read about the Six Days in Fallujah revival after that.",

          "description": "Capcom’s upcoming sci-fi title, Pragmata, has been delayed to 2023. \nPragmata was first announced during the PlayStation 5 reveal event way back in June 2020. It featured an astronaut walking through New York who stumbles upon a little girl. A strange glitch-in-the-matrix happens and all of a sudden, a satellite crashes through the sky and then the duo ends up in space after using some weird 3D printer-like device. It’s as strange as it sounds, as you can see from the Pragmata announcement trailer. \nHowever, when it was first revealed, Capcom said the game would release in 2022. Now, it’s been delayed to 2023, which isn’t all that surprising considering that 2020 look at the title was the last we heard about Pragmata. \nAn update on #PRAGMATA:\npic.twitter.com/3ZTOkIWEYD\nNovember 18, 2021\nAs you can see in the tweet above, Capcom released a new video alongside news of this delay. It features Pragmata’s young heroine holding a piece of paper with “2022” scratched out and “2023” written beside it. The company also released new artwork, which you can see below: \nWhile waiting for Pragmata, check out Game Informer’s coverage of the original announcement. \nAre you excited about Pragamata?

          "description": "Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit has received a new 2.0 update, and it brings split-screen multiplayer, a new four-player Relay Race mode, additional tracks, and more customization to the racer. \nThis update was revealed on Nintendo’s YouTube yesterday in a new video showcasing all you can expect in 2.0. In it, Nintendo reveals the new split-screen multiplayer mode coming to Mario Kart Live, which is the company’s toys-to-life-esque kart racer that tasks players with building a track in their own house and then racing a real Mario Kart RC car around it.\nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nThe new Split-Screen mode is exactly what you’d expect in a Mario Kart game: place two karts onto the track, round up two controllers, and race your friend or foe on-screen. It looks pretty identical to a standard Mario Kart split-screen mode, except it’s your living room on the screen rather than Bowser’s Castle. \nIf two players aren’t enough, you can bring in two more thanks to Mario Kart Live’s new Relay Race mode. In this mode, two players will be on one kart, and they can swap control of the wheel back and forth, meaning up to four people can play at once. Three new courses have been added: Windmill Meadows, Music Broadway, and King Boo’s Courtyard. Plus, Luigi’s Poltergust is now a customization item available for use alongside the Spooky Horn. You must complete the Luigi Cup under certain conditions in the Grand Prix to unlock them, though.\nIf you haven’t yet checked out Mario Kart Live, be sure to read Game Informer’s Mario Kart Live review and then check out this New Gameplay Today featuring some Game Informer editors playing Mario Kart Live.  \nAre you going to jump back into Mario Kart Live to check out the new update?

In 2020, developer 343 Industries brought its latest take on the Halo franchise to the masses during one of Microsoft's digital events. Halo Infinite's gameplay debut was met with some positivity but spawned an online firestorm and popularized conversation around Craig The Brute, among other discussions. It's been over a year since fans were shown that demo, and a lot has changed ahead of Halo Infinite's campaign release on December 8. Before that long-awaited day, join us for a unique updated look at the campaign in all its new shining glory.\nToday's video isn't a complete one-to-one recreation of the 2020 footage, but rather a potent illustration of how the team has improved upon that earlier foundation, including …",
