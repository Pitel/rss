          "description": "The Gearbox developers working on Risk Of Rain 2 have released a patch for its poorly received expansion, Seekers Of The Storm. The recent DLC for the action roguelike came out of the oven a little doughy, with enough game-breaking bugs to thoroughly upset some fans. Including one bug that sometimes made the game's final boss accidentally invincible. Ah. Yesterday's patch seems to target the worst of these bugs, and the dev team promise there are more fixes are to come.\nRead more",

Ubiquitous wearable sci-fi shields repel any attack that comes in too fast, so everyone has to learn this unique, overtly dance-like form of close-quarters combat where every thrust and parry is necessarily slow and considered. Picture it: careful judgments of your movements, weighing up the right time to strike, every measured jab part of a wider strategy that culminates in the kill.\nMOBAs are like that. Both in the fights themselves, sort of, where probing lunges lead up to bursts of lethality, but more broadly in each match as a whole. They’re map-wide knife fights, where a thrust is a well-judged lane push and a parry a savvy item buy. At first, playing Smite 2 felt akin to watching on helplessly as my opponents repeatedly shoved their crysknives through my ribs. After 30 hours, it often still feels like that - but I am enjoying myself. Mostly. Despite Valve’s third-person elephant in the lane. \nRead more",

While approaches to 4X and grand strategy vary hugely between games, factions and players, the genre as a whole is firmly wedded to imperial conquest, both structurally and at the level of narrative aspects and set-dressing. Many 4X games are triumphal re-enactments of specific periods of colonial settlement and expansion. All of which is to say that Syphilisation is fascinating. It's a reworking of the genre which dismantles and reconstructs concepts such as diplomacy, research and production. It's also just left early access - find more details and a playthrough video below.\n Read more",

          "description": "It's been 13 years since the first Space Marine came out. While it wasn't outstanding in the grander landscape of gaming, enough Warhammer 40K fans seem to have cherished the escapades of bulky blue boltgunner Demetrian Titus for the action game to merit a sequel a decade later. It left its story on something of a cliffhanger, with said hero being dragged away to face untold tortures by the Inquisition, the most zealous sect of this preternaturally paranoid sci-fi universe. Today, Titus is free again. Free to stomp towards hordes of alien foes, blast them with a plasma incinerator, and shred the stragglers with a chainsaw sword. Space Marine 2 is an often-satisfying scrapper that has me  convinced of 40K's merit as a crafting ground for excellent-looking environments and creatures, even if I'm not particularly moved by the bland character of Titus and his fellow Ultramarines.\nRead more",

          "description": "In the first post for my series on \"saving\" open world design, I complained that many of today's open worlds feel like checklists of formulaic tasks and rewards, their geography a vaporous staging ground for itemisable, cycling content-gathering opportunities, which flies in the face of the sense of freedom and wonder they're supposed to inspire. My interviewees, Elder Scrolls veterans Matt Firor and Nate Purkeypile, argued that this reflects the expense and scale of today's open world productions, which constrains experimental design both at a practical level and in terms of overall direction.\nCD Projekt open world designer Jakub Tomczak doesn't, as far as I know, have an answer to the issue of production bloat, but he does have a disarmingly obvious solution to the 'checklist problem', based on his time creating missions for Cyberpunk 2077 and its Phantom Liberty expansion: get better at hiding the checklist. Weave it into the landscape and setting more artfully, with an elegant balance of randomisation and responsiveness to the player's behaviour which keeps everything fresh. \r\n\n \nRead more",

It was a copy of The Game of Life, possibly the least exciting board game a child can win.\nThe game was dog water, and there’s probably a lesson in there somewhere about how cool and good it is to whine until you get free things, but we don’t have time for that. Instead, I’d like to draw your attention to Floops Big House Adventure. It’s a grungy, slimy, Aaahh!!! Real Monsters meets Ren and Stimpy Saturday morning shooter.

The game was a bright spot in a bad time, which might seem peculiar given that Sluggish Morss often looks like a whale's upset stomach, but it's such a feverishly inventive creation. It blew the dust from my synapses.\nThe same appears true of King-Spooner's upcoming Judero, on which he is collaborating with Soul Searching developer Talha Kaya. It casts you as a \"pagan seer\" armed with a big stick, who is searching the mythical Scottish borderlands for evil creatures to clobber. It looks cheerier and airier than Sluggish Morss, with a more overt emphasis on mechanics such as combat, but it has the same pickled 3am energy to it.

It also contains the words “bloody” and “arse” in quick succession, though thankfully not next to each other. The only piles are the logs Sid’s crouched behind as he prepares to sneak up to a cable car guarded by Nazis. That is the only haemorrhoids allusion I will ever make on this website. Until the next time I have to write about Andrew Wilson.\n“Oil just use my trusty knoife” mutters Sid as I take down my first guard. Straight away, the animation and noise indicators evoke the same Shadow Tactics or Desperados III goodness you’re probably expecting. Fine with me - that’s exactly what I’m here for.

As several of you identified, this seemed like an odd comparison when Spice Maureen 2 specifically plans to charge for comparable cosmetics, although I imagine Willits was referencing the “packs” that his space game’s baubles come in. “Our fans never thought we ripped them off in World War Z,” he said, comparing Space Marine 2’s optional spendables to that game.\nWhether you see the cosmetic's pricing as egregious or not, yesterday’s roadmap does look to make good on Saber’s promise to keep wearables and playables separate.

          "description": "If you live in the UK, you may have noticed that this week is shy a working day. Credulous fools attribute this to the existence of a \"bank holiday\" on Monday 26th, but true initiates like ourselves know the sobering truth: the Maw has eaten one of our weekdays. We have dispatched our finest gastronauts equipped with extremely long pairs of tweezers to retrieve the missing Monday from the Maw's bowels. We can only hope it hasn't been digested yet - imagine living in a world with a four-day working week? The horror. Anyway, here are this week's PC game releases of note.\nRead more",

          "description": "Almost a decade after his acrimonious departure from Konami, the shadow of Hideo Kojima still looms over Metal Gear Solid. He's there, barely camouflaged, in the undergrowth of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater - a remake of the fifth Metal Gear game, originally released in 2004, which tells the tale of a lone US special operator hunting superweapons and old mentors in the jungles of the southern Soviet Union. \r\n\n\r\nI say \"remake\" but this feels more like a re-release, in spirit. True, it now runs on Unreal Engine, with the option of a manual, third-person perspective and cover-shooter controls in addition to the old top-down viewpoints. Yes, it boasts new flourishes, such as wounds now leaving scars, and clothes picking up stray leaves. Yes, there's a new interface with floating in-world menus, which makes shuffling between the layers a bit less awkward. It's the product of much labour, with development split between Konami and external support partner Virtuos. But where Konami's other big restoration project, Bloober's Silent Hill 2 remake, is a creative dialogue with the original game, Delta seems consumed by faithfulness to Kojima's original design.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's also a free-to-play game, and I have the usual unanswered questions about currencies and gacha, but I'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt for the minute, because I have not spent nearly enough of my life considering the tactical applications of ballgowns.

(It came out in 1997, and as such, I think the statute of limitations on spoilers has passed, but if you still intend to play, stop reading now.) The mission completes the long arc of foreshadowing begun by the intro's mention that capital-class spacecraft have been outlawed, following a ruinous war. It turns out that one particular evil corpo has been sneakily building one of these megaships - not only that, but you get to fly inside it, cannons ablazing. It was while doing so that teenage me realised the true exceptionality of the Video Game Artform. You can't fly inside capital ships in, like, symbolist poems or baroque symphonies, can you? You can't fly in poems or symphonies at all, unless you do so metaphorically - \"metaphor\" being a kind of poor man's graphics card.\nThe technology of flight simming has advanced mightily since G-Police's day. For instance: in Everspace 2's just-announced Titans DLC, you get to fly inside not just regular old spaceships, but massive space kaiju with procedurally generated digestive systems.

You can, quite literally, go on tours curated by historians around each of the game's respective maps. Instead of diving off a Sphinx and plunging your hidden blade into someone's spinal column, you can look up at the Sphinx and read a paragraph on its significance. Maybe view an actual, real life bit of ancient Egypt from an actual real life museum collection in-game. Perhaps embody an Anglo-Saxon lad in Valhalla, instead, and like, cook up some nettle soup having just got a fresh \"Friar Tuck\" at the local hair choppers (no guarantees on this last bit).\nThis is all to say that Black Myth: Wukong deserves such a mode, too. There were so many times throughout my review time where I stopped and stared and wondered as to something's meaning. Not only in the architecture, but in the characters, too. So here I am with a proposition: how about instead of thwacking things with my staff, I can use it as a walking stick and point it at things I want to learn about.\nRead more",

It's a machinegun montage of comicbook panels and sizzling melee arcs and quips like \"there's a lot of wankers between you and the sweet taste of freedom\".

Of course, you can buy them with the help of microtransactions, but not everyone likes to spend money after paying a premium for the game itself. The daily spin might not always drop bountiful rewards, but you get something on a daily basis. The gifts can range from VCs to essential items like skill boosts, but they all count.\n\n\nNBA 2K25 Daily Spin location guide\n\n\nYou can try out the Daily Spin right after creating your MyPlayer.\n\n\n\nGo through the first phase of playing in the Finals.\n\n\nOnce done, talk with your friend for the introductory dialog.\n\n\nWhen you're ready, step out of MyCourt.\n\n\nIf you go right from MyCourt, you'll come across the Arena.\n\n\nIf you go left, you'll come across the \"Crocs\" store and find the two affiliations - Elite and Rise.\n\n\nThe Daily Spins are located right in front of affiliation entrances.\n\n\nStep in front of one, and press the X/A button.\n\n\nWait for a bit for the rewards to show up. If you're unlucky like me, there won't be any VC. But many have found VC from their spins, and some have received large amounts as well.\n\n\n\nImage via Destructoid\n\n\nMost importantly, the spin is free to draw; you just need to travel to the location and spin the draw. This is the easiest way to earn valuable resources to add to your inventory. While VCs help you grow your MyPlayer attributes, other items can help improve the finer aspects of your build.\n\n\nIf you're not happy with the amounts of freebies, there are microtransactions. The Season 1 pass also rewards you with lot of items that benefit your MyPlayer build. \n\nThe post NBA 2K25 Daily Spin location: How to get free VC in MyCareer? appeared first on Destructoid.",

The series' official website recently unveiled a brand-new trailer and key visual to further heighten the excitement for this upcoming sports-romance anime. \n\n\nAlongside this announcement, the trailer offers a first listen to the opening and ending theme songs. Popular Japanese band Official Hige Dandism is performing the series’ opening theme titled \"Same Blue.\" Meanwhile, Eve will provide the ending theme song, \"Teenage Blue.\"\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to its television debut, Netflix will stream the first two episodes on October 3, with subsequent episodes following each television broadcast. However, the release schedule will vary depending on the region. The anime will also be available on a number of other sites, including Hulu and Prime Video.\n\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the franchise, Blue Box is a mix of sports and romance, though more focused on the latter. The plot is centered on Taiki Inomata — a member of the boys' badminton team at Eimei Junior and Senior High — and his crush Chinatsu Kano — an older girl on the basketball team. Most of their interactions are the usual greeting during their parallel morning training, yet their relationship takes a sudden turn when Chinatsu's family is forced to move.\n\n\nFans looking to dive into the story before the anime’s release can find the Blue Box manga available to read digitally on both VIZ Media’s platform and Shueisha’s MANGA Plus.\n\nThe post Blue Box anime will premiere on October 3 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Disney Dreamlight Valley has a history of dropping new and exciting things into social media posts without commenting on them, and they seem to have just revealed something very exciting over on Twitter. \n\n\nIf we take into account Dreamlight Valley’s history of randomly revealing upcoming additions without context, then this Twitter post indicates that players may soon be getting something that they’ve been waiting for for a long time — a Gem stall. \n\n\n\n\nNow, I’m the first to admit that there are some things about this picture that are a little odd, not least of all the fact that Scrooge is around a whole load of Gems and isn’t trying to hoard them away in his personal vault. \n\n\nStalls in Disney Dreamlight Valley have, so far, always worked in the same way. Three items to purchase on the top row, and three items to purchase on the bottom row. By the looks of it, this may-or-may-not-be-coming Gem stall seems to have 12 slots, eight on the top and four on the bottom. That’s a whole lot of Gems.\n\n\nDoes this mean that we’re not getting a Gem stall? No, although we should probably hold off before getting too excited about the prospect. I have to admit that it would solve a lot of problems, particularly when it comes to crafting and gifting, as Gems are always in need and there are never enough of them to be mined. \n\n\nThe last time we saw something like this come up on Disney Dreamlight Valley’s Twitter was back in April, when Gameloft revealed Daisy Duck’s Boutique with very little context and only in-picture clues to go off. \n\n\n\n\nTime will tell whether this Gem stall comes to fruition as the Boutique did, but it has sparked hope that maybe, just maybe, Gems may not be as elusive as they are currently before too long. \n\nThe post A Gem Stall might be coming to Disney Dreamlight Valley appeared first on Destructoid.",
