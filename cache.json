          "description": "No no, *with* Kirby... You'll see.\nIt's safe to say that the Super Smash Bros. Ultimate roster goes through quite a lot; after all, the very aim of the game is to beat on your opponent until you can fling them off the arena and into the sweet nothingness of oblivion. So it's only natural, then, that the fighters will want to use their downtime to relax a bit, put their feet up, or perhaps even play a bit of basketball.\nThat's exactly what Sephiroth and Kirby get up to in a charming and hilarious stop-motion animation posted to social media by @shinohara_kenta (thanks, Automaton). It's a rather short piece, but it's one of the most effortlessly funny pieces of animation we've seen in quite some time. It's a perfect showcase for simplicity: Sephiroth misses his shot, so Kirby gives him a helping hand in the only way he knows. Sublime. Check it out...\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Atten-hut!\nWhen you think of survival horror, chances are you think of zombies, monsters, ghosts, and other fantastical, supernatural creatures. Conscript tries something a bit different. Set during World War I, you’re faced with something more feasible and realistic than any of the aforementioned beasties: the horror of war. Yes, the enemies here are your fellow man; soldiers enlisted to fight in The Battle of Verdun, one of the most brutal and well-known conflicts of the 'Great War'.\nWe must admit to fearing the worst after experiencing Conscript's opening moments. The prologue throws you right into the heat of battle: gunfire rattles in the distance, explosions cut off passageways, and enemies rush at you in groups of two or three. For what is meant to be a top-down survival horror game, it all felt rather chaotic and antithetical to the slow, methodical gameplay and combat. Thankfully, things cool off a bit once you see the title screen and the main game kicks off.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

We scored Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition a 'Good' 7/10 in our review.

The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is boldly going where no mainline series entry has gone before by putting the titular princess in the driver's seat. How shocking! How bold! How unlike anything that we Zelda fans have been calling for for years. Ahem.\nThe 'Zelda is the hero' reveal was only surprising because of how long it's taken. Aside from the obvious protagonist confusion, the series has been crying out for the Hylian monarch to take a starring role. She shines as Sheik in Ocarina of Time (our apologies to those who have avoided that spoiler for the last 25 years), she edged into the spotlight in Spirit Tracks despite it very much still being Link's adventure, and Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom really leaned into the cool magic shenanigans.

          "description": "A good immersive sim, by its very nature, offers myriad varied approaches to solving problems. And yet, I find myself wanting to get hyper-specific when writing about the action of Corpus Edax, because it has an incredibly gratifying metal pipe sound, whether you’re stealthy wrapping it around the back of a blissfully unaware fool’s noggin, or lobbing it directly at their knee caps. In fact - although the game does have a delightful array of classic verbs, along with a few surprises - many of them are simply conducive to a stirring round of fisticuffs, to write my most British sentence of the week.\nRead more",

And what's frustrating is that I just don't get on with them, despite knowing that they can convey brilliant stories through all sorts of interesting cuts and shots and whatnot. I'm sorry to report that certain stories won't grab me if they're not ticking along at just the right pace or if they don't pull me in straight away. I'm a needy soul, someone who demands immediacy and a special emotional sauce.\nUntil Then is, without a doubt, the only visual novel-y game I've truly enjoyed. In fact, I'd say I've more than enjoyed it - I think it's superb so far. The teens that drive this story are written with an authenticity I've not encountered before, and the 3D interwoven with the 2D adds some surprising - besides the literal - depth.\nRead more",

Moose-face stares. What do those eyes convey? Patience? Intent? Longing? If nothing else, they betray a deep certainty that whatever else happens, you’re going to click. If you stop clicking for a moment, a prompt appears in the corner telling you the controls. At least, I think it's a prompt, because it might actually be a threat.\nLeft click to click.

Slimes do take more complex forms - chrome slimes, fire slimes, slimes with angry eyebrows, etc - but come now, it's not on the same level as rebooting Lara Croft's hair to billow in the blowback from grenades.\nThe simplicity of slime creation may soon become a distant memory, however, for Epic Games tech artist and current Duck Shake Games Asher Zhu is hell-bent on reinventing the homely Dragon Quest sludgeball as a technical tour de force on par with his previous contributions to Unreal Engine showcase Matrix Awakens.

Supraworld, the sequel to toybox explorer Supraland, is going to hit early access this year, say developers Supra Games in an update post on Steam. These are happy words for anyone who enjoyed 2019's dander among the sandcastles and erasers. A lot of games offer a \"sandbox\" but in Supraland, the entire world really did take place in exactly that - a sandbox out in a garden, full of toys. The sequel's launch into early access \"might be in october,\" says the post. \"We'll see.\"\nRead more",

The humble croaker dominates the wholesome category, where they take centre stage in farming sims or as detectives or as green lads who hop over platforms and hurt enemies by lashing them with their tongues.\nSchim is different: you play as a frog of the shadows, not some green attention-seeker. And in a mundane world of vibrant colour, you're to bounce between patches of shade in search of a human pal whose shadow you've been unwittingly severed from. What ensues is a charming puzzler of both freedom and flow, which genuinely has you view everyday environments through the googly eyes of a phantom amphibian. It's a lovely thing, if perhaps not as emotionally charged as it implies early on.\nRead more",

Best not speculate.\nAnyway, Fallout London is a huge effort from modders Team Folon that was recently sabotaged when Bethesda treated Fallout 4 to a next gen update to capitalise on the Amazon TV show's popularity, rendering several mods incompatible and breaking a lot of stuff. Team Folon have now fiddled with the workings and sent a Fallout London build to GOG for QA testing, which suggests that release is imminent. The catch, however, is that you will need to downgrade your copy of Fallout 4 to play the mod, because even with Team Folon's last-minute adjustments, Fallout 4 next gen and Fallout London simply don't get on.\n Read more",

Like the lootbox hawkers of yesteryear, gacha designers understand the appeal and power of a pleasingly animated gizmo, ker-chunking open and fizzing with potential. This poppy visual and sonic language stretches across Hoyo's latest game, from its cinematic moments, to each character's attacks, to the cute bunny mascots that erupt into gatling guns, to the barista's coffee-making ritual and the recipes of the robo-limbed noodle server.

          "description": "Read enough of our hardware articles and you’ll eventually come across someone, probably me or Katharine (RPS in peace), banging on about the Logitech G915 Lightspeed Wireless. After half a decade on shelves, it’s still the best low-profile mechanical gaming keyboard going, and quite possibly the best wireless keyboard to boot – while the tenkeyless version, the G915 TKL Lightspeed, is just as lovely to use.\nBetween their nimble performance, crisp mech switches, and impeccable build quality, the only way in which the G915 duo underwhelms is their high pricing – very much the kind you’d want to wait for a Prime Day or Black Friday to dull the pain of. Now, though, there’s an alternative: the new Logitech G515 Lightspeed TKL. I’ve been using it. It’s good!\nRead more",

The studio's existence had been under threat since early this year, after being targeted in Embracer's purgatorial studio massacre. At that time the German studio were hopeful to avoid being closed down, insisting \"don't write us off yet!\" Unfortunately, it looks like those who worked at the studio have since been laid off.\nRead more",

The best-known is probably Frostpunk, with its perpetual raging against the dying of the light, its ceaseless scrape for coal and wood as the temperature falls. Anoxia Station, announced this month, is similarly driven by the gathering of fossil fuels, and similarly shaped by questions of worker death and morale, but it takes you deep underground - into a sumptuous, brutal world of quartz crystals, salt caves, magma lakes, moonmilk rivers, swirling gases and, judging from the below trailer, enormous maggots and centipedes.

It has now been occupied by Russia for almost two years, during which, as reported by the Associated Press, Russia has demolished, rebuilt and renamed much of the city, overwriting its Ukrainian heritage.\nThe Disco Elysium-inspired RPG Hollow Home is a memory of Mariupol from just before the war - not a 1:1 recreation, but a collection of details, colours, personalities and some familiar buildings, painstakingly amassed and offered up in the face of erasure. Speaking to me during a very brief demo at Digital Dragons in Poland this year, artist Anastasia Hlyniana called my attention to the plants jutting from old car tyres around the game's isometric map, which she says are a common sight in Mariupol.\n Read more",

Juno will be playable this weekend, so you can check out her abilities before she arrives in August.\n\n\nAs a Support Hero, Juno can dish out pain and heal it in equal amount. A Martian, she zips around the arena with anti-gravity skates like Shadow the Hedgehog and wields just as mean of a gun. Taking a page from Ana's book, it appears Juno's weapon—the Mediblaster—can heal allies and also damage enemies. She's not a sniper, though; it's a burst weapon that looks more akin to an SMG.\n\n\n\n\nOverwatch 2's next support hero is playable this weekend\n\n\nYou'll be able to try out Juno, who becomes available as part of a limited-time hero trial beginning July 19 and ending July 21. It'll be your best shot until she joins the game's roster when Season 12 starts on August 20. \n\n\nAs you can gather from her trailer, Juno is all about speed and vertical momentum. She can leap into the air with a Glide Boost ability that lets her float. It also seems like she can use it to deliver a nasty kick that likely violates the Hippocratic Oath. Her Hyper Ring creates a field that gives her and her allies a speed boost when entered. If it stacks with Lucio's speed boost, we're probably looking at a new rush strategy. \n\n\nImage via Blizzard\n\n\nThere are some damaging moves mixed in. Her Pulsar Torpedoes lock onto both allies and enemies alike, delivering healing or damage. Her Ultimate move seems to be the Orbital Ray, which fires a massive beam that slowly sweeps the field boosting ally damage and healing.\n\nThe post You can play Overwatch 2’s next support hero Juno this weekend before she arrives in August appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Remember when Epic Games chose to remove the infamous Nitro Fists from Ranked in Fortnite? Well, it has been 13 days and Nitro Fists are still obtainable in the Ranked mode. \n\n\nEpic Games announced on June 5, 2024, that Nitro Fists and vehicles will not be available in Zero Build's Ranked mode. While vehicles have been removed from Ranked, Nitro Fists persist. Somehow, the fists are eluding Epic Games, who have been working on a way to figure out the issue and come up with the necessary fix.\n\n\n\n\nIt has taken an unusual number of days for Epic Games to deal with the matter, and it is particularly surprising as the removal should ideally not be a complicated matter. Fortnite constantly rotates its pool of available items, with many weapons and consumable items making it to the vault and subsequently making a return after some time.\n\n\nWith Nitro Fists however, Epic Games is still looking into the matter, and shared an update on July 16 that the team is “aware of this issue” and thanked fans for their patience while the Fortnite team continues to look into the matter.\n\n\n\n\nThis is particularly interesting when you look back at the initial announcement that stated that this separation of Nitro Fists and vehicles was supposed to last until July 18, 2024. Well, it is July 18 at the time of writing, so it seems like Fortnite players have been running into Nitro Fists all throughout this specified period in Ranked mode.\n\n\nEpic Games could extend the duration of this removal once the matter is finally resolved, and the same might apply to vehicles as well. If that does pan out. We'll have to wait and see what Epic announces next.\n\nThe post Nitro Fists remain in Fortnite Ranked, 13 days after Epic Games said they’d be removed appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Last month, Streets of Rogue 2 set its Early Access date for August 14, but those plans have since changed. The sandbox roguelite sequel is now set to hit Early Access for all starting on October 22.\n\n\nThe reason for the delay is pretty straightforward: according to developer Matt Dabrowski and tinyBuild, Streets of Rogue 2 simply needs more time for additional polish. The announcement states that the team is \"committed to providing the best experience possible,\" even in this early stage, so we'll just have to wait a little longer to try it for ourselves. \n\n\nPart of that polish process involves putting the game through more thorough testing. As Dabrowski says of the new release date, \"it will also give me time to conduct a large-scale pre-release playtest.\" His previous experience on the first Streets of Rogue taught him that this would be \"very beneficial to development.\"\n\n\nProcedural mayhem\n\n\nScreenshot via tinyBuild\n\n\nThe first game already had some pretty impressive scope to it, and it sounds like the sequel is going all out in that regard. Dabrowski previously touched upon how \"stupidly ambitious\" Streets of Rogue 2 is, ramping the procedurally-generated chaos up to absurd heights. \n\n\nThere are plenty of hand-crafted aspects in the mix, too, and that complex blend could likely benefit from the additional attention this delay affords. With dozens of character classes and an open world that is purportedly over 10,000 times the size of one of the levels from the first game, it'll be interesting to see how it all comes together. In the meantime, anyone can take part in the aforementioned playtest, which will kick off in \"late August or early September.\" You can sign up right here. \n\nThe post Streets of Rogue 2 shifts Early Access date to add more polish appeared first on Destructoid.",

To do this, you place and upgrade defensive towers.\n\n\nOnce Wave 8 is defeated, you’ll get the Gardens and Ghouls badge and the Druid Glove.\n\n\nThe Druid Glove gives you the ability to send out a wave of vines. If an enemy is hit by them, they’ll be held in place for five seconds. If they’re under an effect that increases their speed (like the Speedrun Glove), then they’ll still be able to move, albeit slower.\n\nThe post How to get Druid Gloves in Slap Battles appeared first on Destructoid.",

Goku from Dragon Ball Z is expected to get his own LEGO Fortnite  figure skin thanks to some unfinished files spotted in the v30.20 update, as per popular leaker ShiinaBR. \n\n\nAlongside Dragon Ball’s protagonist, a couple of Stranger Things characters seem set to get their Lego skins too. Demogorgon from Stranger Things and Eleven will also reportedly get their own LEGO figure styles too.\n\n\n\n\nThe DJ Bop legendary skin from Fortnite is also said to be arriving in the LEGO game.

The kind of walls that you don't see, but that are there just to prevent you from venturing into areas that the developers don't want you to reach? Well, then let me introduce you to their evil-er brother: Elden Ring's visible non-wall. It's a wall that seems to be there, but is only just a bunch of hollow textures that might lead you to your death.\n\n\nHardcore fans of the series will probably be delighted to learn that Elden Ring's Shadow Of The Erdtree DLC features even more ways to die, but regular players might not be as enthused by the idea.\n\n\n\n\nAs warned by Redditor u/Kedalene, the Scorpion River Catacombs introduced in Shadow Of The Erdtree feature a hilariously terrifying threat. It's not a devious trap that will lure in even the wisest of players, but a bug that causes a specific wall to feature no collision. This is not an illusory wall meant to hide a shortcut or great treasure, but a part of the map that, once crossed, will have players dropping out of bounds to their deaths. It's so accidentally devious that it causes you to die outside of the Stake of Marika's range, forcing players to go back to the entrance of the catacombs.\n\n\nKedelane made the video above to warn players of the existence of the glitch, but also to show off all the fun they have had with making poor unassuming players die to it. I advise everyone to watch the compilation because it's pretty funny, but also because otherwise you might be next.\n\n\nI'm writing this to warn players about this ghastly trap, but please know that I do so while extremely worried that Miyazaki will look into this and decide to come up with a dungeon that's all ghost walls.\n\n\nThis glitch might get fixed soon, but you can still die to it right now, or have people fall for it. Beware of strange etchings in front of walls, I guess.\n\nThe post A glitchy wall in Shadow Of The Erdtree is sending players to their doom appeared first on Destructoid.",

Developer 1047 Games announced a sequel to its original game, and the studio has brought on talent from the teams of Call of Duty, Overwatch, Halo, and more to help make it.\n\n\n1047 Games is calling the game \"bigger and better than ever,\" with a large selection of arenas, weapons, and modes on offer. There will also be three factions to choose from \"based on your preferred gameplay style and competitive strategies,\" according to the press release. Splitgate 2 will also be running on Unreal Engine 5, marking a visual upgrade from the 2019 predecessor. \n\n\n\n\nTo coincide with the Splitgate 2 announcement, there's an official Companion app. Once you boot it up, you can get collectibles that offer in-game rewards when the sequel launches. There are also quizzes to complete and a comic series to read through. The first issue is out today, and the next four parts will be released every month. They focus on the backstories of those heroes featured in this week's trailer.\n\n\n\"This is a revolutionary step forward for competitive shooters,\" said co-founder and CEO of 1047 Games in the press release. \"It's the perfect entry point for players new to the world of Splitgate and a comprehensive upgrade worthy of our existing community.\"\n\n\nSince launching Splitgate, 1047 Games has grown into a large team of over 150 developers, who have experience with other multiplayer titles like the Halo series, Valorant, and League of Legends. Hopefully, that knowledge will prove fruitful for this upcoming shooter, as the team is currently targeting next year for launch. \n\n\nRegardless, you should check out the original if you haven't already; it's one of the best free-to-play games on Steam right now.\n\nThe post Splitgate 2 is the next step for the portal-shooter, with some experienced FPS talent on board appeared first on Destructoid.",

The event will also include several new Legend and weapon skins to grab, including legendary Newcastle skin. Void Reckoning Event will start on July 23, 2024.\n\n\nThis 12v12 deathmatch mode will be available in the Mixtape playlist. Apex Legends players will receive “improved” health regeneration, and the first team to hit 60 kills will win the match. There will be a total of 5 maps rotating for this LTM mode.\n\n\n\n\nPlaying in both battle royale mode and this deathmatch mode will allow players to earn Void points, which can be used to unlock items from the event reward shop. The rewards in the Apex Legends shop will change weekly. There’s a set number of Void points that can be earned in a day by completing daily challenges.\n\n\nIn total, there are 22 knight-themed cosmetics for Wraith, Mirage, Octane, Ash, Caustic, and more, including a reactive Havoc weapon skin. Unlocking all rewards will also unlock the legendary “Galatic Garrison” Newcastle skin, which arrives as the final milestone reward. The milestone rewards unlock at different stages of the event, meaning you receive a milestone reward after obtaining 5, 7, and 17 items.\n\n\nVideo via Respawn Entertainment\n\n\nPlayers can unlock all 22 items via event-themed packs as well, which can be bought from the item shop. Players in Apex Legends can also directly buy Legend skins for Wraith, Caustic, and more from the shop as well.\n\n\nIf you somehow miss out on some rewards, the milestone rewards can be bought from the store for a limited time once the Void Reckoning event ends.\n\nThe post Apex Legends Void Reckoning event introduces 12v12 deathmatch mode appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Tinybuild and Matt Dabrowski have announced that Streets of Rogue 2, the anticipated sequel to the hectic sandbox game, is having its Early Access debut pushed back to October 22, 2024. It was originally planned to be released on August 14.\n\n\nThe press release states that Streets of Rogue 2 will take “additional time to sharpen its tools of destruction.” It doesn’t get any more specific with its details. In fact, when I initially read the PR, it sounded like it was excitedly announcing the launch date, and I had to re-read it to realize that it had an apologetic tone.\n\n\n\n\nThe original Streets of Rogue came out in 2019, and it currently enjoys a 96% “overwhelmingly positive” user review score on Steam. The game’s title should have been workshopped, and I had it confused for a different game for years before realizing that the two aren’t the same and that I should probably play Streets of Rogue. Then I set it aside because I’m a busy person and didn’t get into it for the first time until just now when I needed additional context.\n\n\nThe first game is sort of like a progression of miniature immersive sims, where you’re dropped on a randomly generated floor and have to complete objectives using only the skills on hand and items that can be found in the environment.\n\n\nStreets of Rogue 2 is taking this to a more open world. There’s farming for some reason. The open world is apparently 10,000 times larger than a level in the first game. It promises “uncompromised” freedom. It looks like how I would imagine a Saint’s Row game would be if it went 2D.\n\n\nStreets of Rogue 2 is now targeting October 22, 2024 for release on Steam Early Access.\n\nThe post Streets of Rogue 2 gets explosive new delay, will instead be out in October appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "While playing Zenless Zone Zero, you might get some items that mention an 'Attribute Counter effect' in its description. While most things are well-stated in the game, Attribute Counter effects are oddly lacking in proper guidance, so here's everything you need to know about them.\n\n\nWhat is an Attribute Counter effect in Zenless Zone Zero?\n\n\nArrtibute Counter effects are the result of hitting an enemy with a weakness to a specific Attribute. For clarity, Attribute here refers to the typing of an Agent. Rina, for example, is an Electric Attribute Agent, and she has an Attribute Counter when she hits a robotic enemy with Electric Attribute attacks. While this naturally results in robots taking more damage and increased Anomaly build-up from Rina's attacks, specific items, such as the Unfettered Game Ball W-Engine, activate their effects based on this Attribute Counter, resulting in an Attribute Counter effect.\n\n\nImage by Destructoid\n\n\nUsing the Unfettered Game Ball in a more specific example, its description states that all Agents gain a CRIT RATE bonus for twelve seconds to any targets with an Attribute Counter effect triggered against them. If Rina is using the Unfettered Game Ball and hits a robot enemy with any of her Electric attacks, then the Unfettered Game Ball's effect will activate and all your active Agents will get the CRIT RATE bonus. \n\n\nFrom what I can tell, there is no hard indicator that an Attribute Counter effect has occurred, which does make taking advantage of the mechanic a bit more difficult. Thankfully, I've only found a few things in Zenless Zone Zero that specifically use it.\n\nThe post What is an Attribute Counter effect in Zenless Zone Zero? appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Skeleton Crew, the team behind the 2021 side-scrolling action game Olija, and Devolver Digital have revealed an intriguing new project: Forestrike. The game sports a unique premise: as a martial artist, you can foresee and simulate future combat encounters, allowing you to perfect your execution before laying a finger on anyone. \nThe fighter battles to free a captive Emperor from an evil Admiral, and doing so involves mastering Foresight, a meditative technique to mentally predict and play out battles before they unfold (for Dragon Ball fans, think of image training). Gameplay-wise, players are pitted against different combinations of enemy types. They use Foresight to play the battle in advance to find the optimal approach to defeating them while taking little to no damage.\nFor example, using Foresight may help you learn to dodge a charging enemy so they trample an ally, then finish him off by lobbing a nearby weapon. Determining the best approach may take several Foresight attempts, but once you have your strategy down, you then execute the battle in real-time. After winning a fight, a replay feature allows you to rewatch it using slow-motion and other editing tools to study your strategy or generally feel cool about your performance. \n\n\nUsing the Foresight makes Forestrike's combat feel puzzle-like in its execution, and winning fights as flawlessly as possible matters. That’s because you have limited health to fight through multiple stages in a roguelike-style branching map. Along the way, you’ll earn upgrades that carry over to future runs, as well as perks called Techniques that enhance your abilities. \nForestrike is a neat spin on the action genre, and it's slated to launch sometime in 2025 for Switch and PC.",

          "description": "Splitgate’s combination of Halo-esque first-person shooter with Portal-inspired portal jumping mechanics made it quite the sensation when it launched in open beta in 2021. With its servers regularly buckling under the weight of its players, the game caught lightning in a bottle but petered out when the game finally went 1.0 and simultaneously ceased receiving support in 2022. Now, developer 1047 Games is back with Splitgate 2 and aims to refine the original's winning formula. \nLike the first game, Splitgate 2 will be a free-to-play 4v4 shooter that arms players with a portal gun and more traditional firearms to battle each other in aerial, dimension-hopping combat. The sequel is being built in Unreal Engine 5 and has a new emphasis on factions. Players can suit up to compete in the Sol Splitgate League as members of one of three groups: the agile Aeros, the time-manipulating Meridian, or the trigger-happy Sabrask. According to a press release, “Factions will grant players the ability to choose and progress based on their preferred gameplay style or competitive strategies.” Splitgate 2 will feature new objective-based game modes across new arenas and upgradable weapons. \nAdditionally, a special Splitgate 2 companion app is available to download now. The app lets players explore the game’s universe through collectibles that unlock in-game rewards when Splitgate 2 launches. It also features quizzes and a new comic series called Splitgate: The Games We Play. The five-issue series will flesh out the backstory of the characters featured in the announcement trailer and additional issues will arrive monthly. \nSplitgate 2 launches in 2025 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Check out the first batch of screenshots below.",

          "description": "Nintendo is, relatively speaking, a family-oriented company. Their games are aimed at kids, their parents, and everyone in between with bright colors, wholesome storytelling, and extremely approachable game design. That said, there are exceptions to this rule, like in this creepy 15-second teaser uploaded to the company's YouTube channel last week. A man in a trench coat wearing a paper bag with a smile drawn on it stares into the camera while a distorted music box plays in the background. The only additional context we got was the hashtag #WhoIsEmio, leaving fans scrambling to figure out what exactly this was hinting at.\nToday, that mystery has been cleared up. Emio, also known as \"The Smiling Man,\" is the star of a new game in the Famicom Detective Club series, which hasn't had a new entry in 35 years. The game was revealed today alongside a video featuring series producer Yoshio Sakamoto, who wrote the first two games and went on to direct titles like Super Metroid and Metroid: Zero Mission. According to him, they decided to make this new entry during their time developing the Famicom Detective Club remakes back in 2021.\n\"In Emio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club, a student has been found dead in a chilling fashion, his head covered with a paper bag with an eerie smiling face drawn on it,\" a press release reads. \"This unsettling visage bears a striking resemblance to a recurring clue in a string of unsolved murders from 18 years ago, as well as Emio (the Smiling Man), a killer of urban legend who is said to grant his victims 'a smile that will last forever.'\" Players will assume the role of a private investigator and set out to solve the case and stop the killer for good.\nEmio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club will be released for the Nintendo Switch next month, on August 29. Hopefully, the titular killer won't murder too many people before then.\nAre you excited to see this series revived? Let us know in the comments!",

Amid a wave of price reductions and other end-of-life updates, nostalgic fans can relive the console's earliest days via a new dynamic background modeled after the old “Blades” interface.\nFor those too young to remember or didn’t get an Xbox 360 until years later, the Blades interface was the console's first dashboard design. It was the first thing players saw from the console’s launch in 2005 until it was updated to an entirely different interface in 2008.

          "description": "Dead by Daylight’s 8th-anniversary stream revealed a few big updates for the popular asymmetrical horror game. The most immediate is the addition of Lara Croft as the game’s latest crossover survivor along with the impending addition of the much-requested 2v8 mode. \nTomb Raider Chapter\nLara Croft (the 2013 reboot version, specifically) joins DBD today, and though she lacks her pistols and bow, she sports three new perks highlighting her adventuring prowess. Here's an explanation of each per DBD's website:\nFinesse: Your fast vaults are faster when healthy, with a cooldown after a successful use.\nHardened: When you open a Chest and cleanse or bless a Totem, Hardened activates for the duration of the Trial. From that point, every time you scream, you’ll instead reveal the Killer’s Aura.\nSpecialist: When you open or rummage through a Chest, gain 1 Token (up to 3). When you do a Great Skill Check, consume a Token to reduce the max required Generator progress.\n\n\n2v8 Mode\nOn July 25, a new 2v8 multiplayer mode descends into the game. This pits two Killers against eight survivors in expanded versions of five classic maps. The number of generators has been doubled, and Survivors must now repair 8 out of 13 to escape. Captive Survivors are now sent directly into cages, and Survivor perks have been reworked into a new role system designed to encourage teamwork. \n\n\nCross-Progression\nCross-progression is being implemented on July 22. This means players can now sync their progress across multiple owned versions of the game. Everything can be shared across any platform except for Switch, which has a few restrictions as you can see in the chart below. \nToday’s stream also revealed a new trailer and the release date for The Casting of Frank Stone, the single-player DBD game developed by Supermassive Games (Until Dawn, The Quarry). You can read all about that here.",

          "description": "The Casting of Frank Stone, Supermassive Games’ single-player narrative-driven horror game set in the Dead by Daylight universe, has a release date. This intriguing horror collaboration will arrive on September 3, and a new trailer provides a proper introduction of the main cast. \nDeveloped by Supermassive (Until Dawn, The Quarry) and published by Dead by Daylight developer Behaviour Interactive, The Casting of Frank Stone stars five teenagers – Christine Gordon, Jaime Rivera, Linda Castle, Robert Green, and Bonnie Rivera – who film their own horror movie in an abandoned steel mill. Unfortunately, this mill has ties to a notorious murderer named Frank Stone, and the youth’s innocent art project goes horribly wrong.\n\n\nWe still don’t know much about the narrative other than that it is set within the world of Dead by Daylight and takes place in the town of Cedar Mills during the summer of 1980. Gameplay-wise, The Casting of Frank Stone follows a similar blueprint to Supermassive’s previous horror titles in that it’s a choice-driven adventure where characters can be permanently killed off based on your decisions. You can check out a recent gameplay trailer here to see it in action. \nThe Casting of Frank Stone is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

As such, those companions are key to everything happening in Veilguard. \nWith such a significant emphasis on these characters, I spoke to some of the game's leads to learn precisely about BioWare's philosophy on companions in Veilguard. \n\n\n\"No, that is the case,\" BioWare general manager Gary McKay tells me when I ask if he agrees with the stumbled-onto-greatness sentiment. \"I would first …",

The game was first announced last September. \nA Heartful of Games is developing the game, which retains the stylized Spider-Verse-inspired art direction from the hit film. The story unfolds after the movie's events and sees Leo, Raph, Donny, and Mikey battling a new wave of mutants invading New York City. \n\n\nAs previously covered in our exclusive preview earlier this year, Mutant Mayhem is a third-person action/platformer game, and each turtle features a unique playstyle. The game also supports up to two-player local co-op. \nTMNT: Mutants Unleashed launches on October 18 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. The game is also getting a fancy Collector Edition, and you can see the contents of that here. Mutants Unleashed is one of several TMNT games to arrive in recent years (and the third in 2024 alone, following Wrath of the Mutants and the Switch port of Splintered Fate), and you can read all about the franchise’s history in video games in our in-depth retrospective.",

          "description": "Mortal Kombat 1’s final Year 1 DLC fighter arrives next week, and it’s Takeda Takahashi. The young Shirai Ryu warrior makes only his second appearance in a Mortal Kombat game and looks every bit as capable as his older clanmates, Scorpion and Smoke. \nAlthough Takeda was Kenshi’s son in his debut appearance, Mortal Kombat X, the remixed timeline of Mortal Kombt 1 has changed him to Kenshi’s cousin. Like Kenshi, Takeda grew up a Yakuza but was more faithful to the clan than his cousin. As such, the Yakuza tasked Takeda with killing Kenshi, and the two battled, with the latter coming emerging victorious. Takeda was mortally wounded in the battle and rushed to the aid of the Shirai Ryu, where Kenshi protected him from being killed by the Yakuza for failing his mission. This causes Takeda to have a change of heart and join the Shirai Ryu to wage war against Earthrrealm’s criminal underground and, eventually, the evil forces of Outworld. \nTakeda still utilizes the Shirai Ryu fighting style, including his signature pair of bladed whips. He also sports shurikens, a barrage of teleporting flame attacks, and an aerial grapple best described as mid-air corkscrew piledriver. Check Takeda out below.  \n\n\nTakeda will be available on July 23, both as a standalone purchase and as a free download for Kombat Pack owners. The same day also sees previously revealed Kameo fighter Ferra become available to buy. Both Takeda and Ferra will be playable for the first time during Evo 2025 this weekend. \nFor more on Mortal Kombat 1, check out our review as well as the trailers for previous DLC fighters Homelander, Omni-Man, Ermac, Peacemaker, and Quan-Chi.",

          "description": "The Double Dragon series has been around since the arcades in 1987 and has managed to maintain a surprisingly consistent release cadence in those more than 35 years. It was only last year that we played Double Dragon Gaiden, a pixelated throwback brawler (or belt-scroll action game, per its official YouTube description) take on the franchise.\nThis next entry is decidedly more modern, with fully 3D visuals. It's not the first time the series has explored this dimension, but it is a rare occurrence. The game is being developed by Yuke's, the developer that worked on the WWE 2K franchise until 2K19 and most recently developed AEW: Fight Forever. It is being published, or presented by, as the trailer implies, Arc System Works, the developer behind Guilty Gear and Dragon Ball FighterZ.\nDouble Dragon Revive is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and One, and PC sometime in 2025.\n\n\nFor a whole lot more on Double Dragon, but maybe not the version of Double Dragon you're thinking, head here to read all about the 1994 movie. Back in 2019, I tracked down the film's director, James Yukich, to talk about the bizarre film's trajectory, what went wrong, and what he would have done differently had he been giving a chance to try making the film again.",

And later this year, there will be a handful of price increases for various tiers. Here's the exact text as it is presented on Microsoft's website.\nStarting July 10, 2024, the following updates to Xbox Game Pass will take effect:\n    Price changes will go into effect for new members for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, Xbox Game Pass Core, and PC Game Pass.\n    Game Pass for Console will no longer be available for new members.\n    Members who are already subscribed to Game Pass for Console and have automatic payment renewal enabled will be able to continue to enjoy their membership.\nAlso, a new Game Pass option, Xbox Game Pass Standard, will become available in the coming months. These changes will enable us to bring members more value and more great games to Game Pass.\nThe new Xbox Game Pass Standard tier for new members will be $15 a month and will not include access to Day One releases, EA Play, Game Pass for PC, and cloud gaming.\nXbox Game Pass Ultimate, which includes access to all the bonuses now not included in the Standard tier is increasing its price from $17 a month to $20.\nXbox Game Pass Core, which offers online access and a much smaller library of curated games, is changing its yearly from $60 to $75. The $10 monthly price for that tier, however, will remain unchanged.\nPC Game Pass is increasing from $10 per month to $12, but that tier will still include Day One releases.\nAll of these price changes will be reflected starting on September 12.\nPrice changes for services you already pay for are always frustrating. What do you think of the change? Do you plan on maintaining your subscription? Or is it time to cancel?",

In the Resident Evil 4 (RE4) VR port, all it takes is lifting the controller in the air at the right time.\nAnd it’s always satisfying.\nThe parry mechanic is one of the novel additions of the 2023 remake developed by Capcom. Whenever a bolt or melee attack from an infected villager is about to impact Leon Kennedy, you only need to press a button to deflect with the in-game knife. This action grants an opportunity to follow up with an attack on the spot while simultaneously adding to RE4’s original close-quarter smackdown.\nAdapting this to the PlayStation VR2 wasn’t easy. Instead of Leon doing a swift animation with just a button press, you need to grab the knife from your chest, lift it up in the air, and match the incoming attack. I…",

In the wake of such a weird cultural moment, I’m certainly not the only one left wondering how the dust settles, especially as it relates to how we meet up, build friendships and relationships, and socialize. If you’re a gamer, answering those questions requires an additional layer of complexity since we spend much of our free time in virtual worlds. I’ve found myself wondering where our favorite hobby fits into the equation.\nFor some years, the “third place” gave a name to a thing that’s been part of our lives forever.

Owners of these games will still be able to play their single-player content, but online support for these titles will end on November 7. The embedded announcement post on X also includes a link to an FAQ to answer additional questions about the sunsetting process. \nhttps://t.co/2W8dLlGjBM\nJune 28, 2024\nWhile the digital PS3/Xbox 360 versions of these games are going away, Battlefield 3 will still be available to purchase on PC. The same is true for Battlefield 4 and Hardline, and these two titles will also remain on sale for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The PC/PS4/Xbox One versions will remain unaffected by today’s updates.\nIt never feels good to see games get removed from sale like this. The reason likely has to do with EA sunsetting online support; it wouldn't be right to continue selling games with popular online modes if that component doesn't work anymore. For those still logging into Battlefield matches on PS3 and 360, you've got a few more months to enjoy the ride.\nFor more on Battlefield, you can learn about how the next entry is shaping up (which is being made with help by Dead Space remake developer Motive Studios) here.",

And it continues to look like a scary new addition to the A Quiet Place movie universe. \nThough there's still no release date – it's launching sometime this year on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC – this story trailer reveals more about the state of the world in The Road Ahead. It seemingly begins on Day One, when the aliens, which possess incredible hearing that requires people to remain silent to survive, attack Earth. It then jumps ahead to Day 105, with Alex, an asthmatic college student trying to survive the end of the world with her boyfriend Martin, on the hunt for supplies and more. \nCheck it out for yourself in the story trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead below: \n\n\nAs you can see, it seems Alex might be pregnant, which, if you've seen the first A Quiet Place movie, can make trying to remain silent in this world quite difficult. We'll have to wait a little longer to find out how the story of A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead plays out because it launches later this year on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. \nFor more about the game, watch the reveal trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead. \nAre you excited for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead?

It's easily the best character creator in series history and possibly the most robust I've ever seen in a video game.
