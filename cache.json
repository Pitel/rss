That's what a speedrunner known as 'Player 5' recently did, and to top it off - it was achieved in under 24 hours. In fact, you can watch the whole stream on replay via Twitch.\nAs highlighted by GamesRadar+, the quickest run was 24 minutes and 16 seconds. This was done with the help of a variety of skills and tricks, and on average each run was about 25 minutes. Upon completion, Player 5 smiled and that was that - arguably the greatest speedrun since the launch of the action-adventure game in 2017. Player 5 is also known for previously setting a 'world record' BOTW speedrun - completing the game in 25 minutes and 23 seconds.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

We also hopped on the ol' soapbox once again, this time chatting about our desire for a Paper Mario-style Zelda game and pleading for a Baten Kaitos remake (spurred on by some recent rumours). It's also been a big week for reviews as we gave our thoughts on Fire Emblem Engage, Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden amongst others.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Originally launched back on November 21st, 2014 in North America alongside Super Smash Bros. for Wii U, the toys-to-life figurine series has maintained relatively steady interest while competitors like Disney Infinity and Skylanders have completely fallen by the wayside. It's a phenomenon that really only Nintendo could successfully pull off for so long.\nAs we look ahead to 2023 and begin to ponder the prospect of a Switch successor, however, we do admittedly find ourselves thinking about what role amiibo will play in Nintendo’s future. Indeed, once Nintendo is completely done with the Super Smash Bros. line-up (with Sephiroth and Kazuya now available, that leaves just Pyra, Mythra, and Sora), one can’t help but wonder whether that will signal the end for these NFC figures.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

One is that more game developers now work for independent studios rather than AAA. 39% of the devs surveyed currently work for an indie game company, while 23% work for a AAA developer.

It’s smart, concise, and I can’t stop playing.\nPlaying as your little green knight, you are given five dice each round to place on a game board. Each one represents a certain action, the basic ones being attacking and defending, but ramping up to mass healing and boosting the stats of other dice. Energy points dictate how many dice you can place on the board, with each one costing the number on its face. Placement is key, as different combinations can lead to better outcomes like, for example, how you can place an attack die in a space affected by a booster die to up its damage.\nRead more",

The thematic overlap of these games, coupled with their contrasting design philosophies, provides an excellent springboard to reassess the latter – one of the most opaque, challenging, and underappreciated titles in recent memory, just in time for the arrival of its first official DLC, Rain World: Downpour. \r\n\n \nRead more",

It is very interesting to see those original handcrafted figures. And it is very funny to discover that the process of animating one character's hands involved wearing a little cardboard green screen like a shroud while waggling a sexy gloved arm through the hole.\nRead more",

Then it became a deep sense of longing for something I'd lost, like a cascade of sand that fell from my palm as I wept gently on an empty beach. The \"it\" is a mobile and Nintendo Switch game called Pokémon Quest (don't laugh), which was the first - and only -  mobile game I've actively obsessed over.\nThe game's an auto-battler where you gather a small trio from the original 150 Pokéfolks, level them up, and then tackle trickier and trickier stages. After a frankly disgusting number of hours, I'd finished all the stages. So, I thought, \"Yes, of course they will add the 2nd generation of Pokéfolks with a bunch of new stages. This is its natural evolution, if you will\". It still hasn't happened and probably never will. And I hate that I can't find anything else that'll replace it.\nRead more",

What begins as a YA coming-of-age tale about a small-town romance quickly gains remarkable momentum, and suddenly you’re dealing with supernatural teens trying to desperately stop a world-ending calamity. Part sci-fi drama, part high school romance, A Space For The Unbound manages to have incredible weight and grandeur while also being poignant, sweet, and honest at the same time.

There's even a charming new graphics overhaul to replace the famous ASCII symbols which, depending on who you ask, might not have technically counted as \"graphics\" at all.\nI'm not here to discuss the relative merits of this shiny new version and the \"classic\" version. Both will be updated in future, the latter still free, and neither expected to reach a full 1.0 release inside 20 years.

(The third camp was \"eh, I might check it out\" and watched the other two camps duking it out). I was in camp two. If you're adapting something, adapt! Make changes! Otherwise I might as well just consume the original thing again! The Last Of Us has already been released, what, three times?\nThis was made funnier by the fact that nobody on staff had seen the TV show, so we were just arguing about tweets we'd seen that describe the show, the worst way to conduct a discussion outside of e.g. scrawling insults on the side of Teslas and self-driving them into each other's front doors. But it got me to thinking about adaptations, because there have been loads of adaptations of things that aren't games into video games. What goes wrong in the other direction?\nRead more",

There was a lot to take in, from robo-gloves, to sex-dom vending machines, to grannies with bazookas.\nI went in with expectations that it might be a little like BioShock, all steely and serious in its delivery of some vaguely philosophical truth.

In Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers, not only can the titular protagonist suffer a variety of gruesome fates if you so much as put a foot wrong, but there's a point where you can soft-lock the entire game by failing to pick up an easily missable single snake scale from a busy crime scene — and you won't even know you did anything wrong for several in-game days. I'm not 100% sure this wasn't an oversight on the part of the developers, but at the same time, that's exactly the sort of shit that Sierra liked to pull.\nRead more",

Farlanders is my messy breakup.\nIt's a space colony city builder with a puzzle game mentality - and set on Mars to make things even more enticing. The best part of Farlanders is its story, and while it’s not quite a full-blown commentary on colonialism, it examines what you’re doing and why you’re doing it with a self-awareness that I did not expect at all. That being said, annoying difficulty curves, awkward terraforming, and frustrating progression systems stop this space colony sim from really taking off. A graph charting my enjoyment over time would look like a child’s drawing of a mountain.\nRead more",

Every enemy sits still, waiting for you to come and whack it. Whack willy-nilly, though, and they'll kill you in no time - so you have to tactically explore parts of each level to heal, while targeting foes in an order that lets you survive long enough to level up and take on the big bads. \nDesktop Dungeons: Rewind is an upcoming \"modern remastering\" of the original, with 3D graphics and the ability to rewind time rather than start each level from the very beginning. It's got a demo you can play right now, and it's adding free daily challenges with a sharable leaderboard later this month. I am hyped.\n\n \nRead more",

Yet it was also tempered fun: a brutal AI Director could easily tip manageable chaos into a fatiguing onslaught of fishy alien minibosses, and I still remember my will to persevere being sapped by connectivity issues and a general lack of weight to the otherwise enticing pew-pew gunplay.\r\n\n\r\nHappily, following a year of tweaks and additions, The Anacrusis is in a much better place. Even if that place is still turtleneck-deep in extraterrestrial viscera. Ahead of the game’s first anniversary, I poked developers Stray Bombay for a chat on how their early access approach is working out, the impact of long-awaited mod tools, and what’s next for this most stylish of space shooters.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Ty fungují dobře, ale při vyplňování formulářů mají velké problémy s českými znaky. Je to způsobené tím, že samotný standard PDF zná jen základní sady znaků, v kterých znaky české abecedy chybí, vysvětluje Jiří Eischmann na stránkách MojeFedora.cz. Standard sice zná ještě znakovou sadu RTF, ale ta zase není podporovaná všemi klienty. Najít tedy řešení nad rámec standardu, které bude kompatibilní napříč různými implementacemi, není jednoduchá záležitost.",

A total of seven different tanks are available, all featuring their own respective traits and weapons, and a massive arsenal of 15 weapons and power-ups can be picked up to turn the tide of battle in your favor.\nCheck out the warfaring action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber VideoGaming4U.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsRkKaIYdYo&ab_channel=VideoGaming4U\nFeaturing maze-like maps, destructible environments, land hazards, and winner-takes-all gameplay, Tank Force can be seen as something of an alternate to multiplayer hits such as Irem's cutesy hit Bomberman, though it obviously lacks the charm and charisma of the Hudson Soft series. Tank Force would not be ported to the home market of the 1990s, though it would make a reappearance as part of a number of Namco classic compendiums. Today, Tank Force's dynamic, score-attack-based gameplay has helped attract a niche but devoted community, still chasing those '90s high-score dreams.\nTank Force is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.\nThe post Namco’s 1991 release Tank Force rumbles in the Arcade Archives appeared first on Destructoid.",

Specifically, Granblue Fantasy: Versus is getting an expansion that’s launching worldwide this year. Granblue Fantasy: Versus Rising will feature new stages, new characters, and a new story for players to experience. As you can see in the Versus Rising trailer below, it’s confirmed the game will have rollback net code and crossplay between PS4/PS5 and PC via Steam.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ln58g217C4\nSkimming through the game's website, it's confirmed that all 24 characters from the original game will return for this semi-sequel. Additionally, anybody who missed out on Versus will be able to experience an abridged version of that game's celebrated story mode. If you play a lot of Versus online, know that the online lobby will be completely revamped for Versus Rising and will include the all-new \"Grand Bruise Legends\" mini-game mode.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVAZg3QJF0\nI guess calling it \"Granblue Fall Guys\" would have been a little too on the nose. Either way, all of that looks great, and it's nice to know that Street Fighter 6 will have some competition this year. Expect Cygames and Arc System Works to reveal more details and new features as we get closer to its launch date. Granblue Fantasy: Versus Rising will release worldwide this year for PS4, PS5, and PC via Steam. And if you're still playing the original Versus, know that the final update for that game will release on January 24.\nThe post Granblue Fantasy: Versus Rising set to launch in 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Why the PSP version? Unlike the philosophical question of our purpose, there probably is a good answer for why we’re getting Persona 3 Portable instead of one of its console kin, but we don’t really know it. There have been theories about the Persona 3 FES code being a mess or having been lost, but that’s exactly what I hear every time there’s a poor or missing port. Then there’s the rumor that Persona 3 is being remade, which I also doubt, but maybe.\nIn any case, here we are: Persona 3 Portable on console and PC.\nThe worst part about the whole experience is that I’m constantly wondering what I’m doing on this version and whether or…",

          "description": "Inflation affects yet another title\nFactorio is one of those games that came out a good while ago, but I hear about it everywhere now, as it's continued to gain steam and further garner a player base as the years have gone on. The base-building strategy game originally came out on Steam in 2016, and its continued success just speaks to some solid game design, if you ask me. Now, seven years later, developers Wube Software have announced that Factorio will be receiving a price increase from $30 to $35 on Steam, and have cited inflation as the explanation for the change.\nhttps://twitter.com/factoriogame/status/1616388275169628162\nThe game originally cost $20 when it was in early access on Steam in 2016, and the price increased to $30 with the release of version 1.0 in 2020. This change goes into effect on January 26, 2023, as per the tweet from Wube. The developers also added a comment to their Steam page that reads, \"We don't have any plans to take part in a sale or to reduce the price for the foreseeable future\" -- and this message is in place before the price increase hits.\nWube's announcement comes in the wake of tons of other inflation-driven price hikes, whether they're for other games, consoles, or streaming services. This is the first I've yet to see of a well-known indie game increasing their price (we've seen this in the AAA space for a while now with the new $70 standard), but I have a feeling it's a trend that's gonna catch on.\nThe post Factorio developers to increase price on Steam due to inflation appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Avast, ye! An update is here!\nIt always makes me happy to see Sea of Thieves in the news — it's one of those games that I think has a great premise and always delivers on the fun, and it's managed to live on despite threats of a shutdown in 2022. The game is not only alive now, but thriving — evidenced yet again by announced a new update for 2023 that Rare announced this week. This release will focus on matchmaking improvements, as well as the addition of Pet Rocks and a brand new live event called The Secret Wilds. It's always been exciting to be a pirate, but now, even more so.\nThe Secret Wilds event will take over right where the previous PvE event The Rogue's Legacy left off, which explored the backstory of an undead pirate named Captain Briggsy. The event will run from January 18-February 2, so players will have a few weeks to delve further into the mystery.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XresgzEZaT0\nSea of Thieves is also getting a whole host of new cosmetics, including the \"Labyrinth Looter\" set of outfits, guns, and ship accessories themed around the Greek myth of Theseus and the Minotaur. There's also a new emote that has players playing with their very own Pet Rock — I guess if you can't have a parrot, a rock is the next best thing.\nArguably the most exciting changes, however, come in the form of improvements to the game's PvP mode, especially when it comes to its matchmaking systems. In an attempt to make queue times shorter, Rare is introducing a system that will pair players with an opponent from the same faction if load times are too long to make sure that players will always be able to get into a game. In addition, Rare is also increasing the number of PvP arenas from six to 50, and the losing crew in a battle will receive more compensation as an effort to make losses less bothersome.

These cuts arrive in a week full of layoffs at companies across the video game and tech industry.\nAccording to a report from journalist Jacob Wolf, the layoffs are largely focused on talent acquisition, recruiting departments, and its publishing arm, though the esports and support units were also affected. The 46 layoffs account for less than one percent of Riot, which currently sits at over 4,500 worldwide employees.\nIn a statement to Wolf, Riot Games says it \"implemented strategic shifts within a few teams to sharpen [its] focus in a number of areas.\"\n\"With these shifts, certain roles were eliminated, impacting a total of 46 Rioters,\" said a Riot spokesperson in a statement to Wolf. \"This is part of our normal course of our business: We periodically make changes to our structure and our teams based on what we believe will allow us to deliver the best content and experiences for players. We never make these decisions lightly and will always start from a place of wanting to retain Rioters and have them focus on our highest priorities. While that’s not always possible, it’s our primary goal.\"\nRiot Games will continue to hire, with a number of available positions posted on its website.\nOngoing industry layoffs\nThese cuts arrive amidst a week full of industry layoffs, at many video game and tech companies. Microsoft recently confirmed it will be laying off 10,000 workers, with reports including cuts at Xbox studios like 343 Industries. Amazon has also initiated a round of job cuts that look to include around 18,000 people, and Google parent company Alphabet is cutting 12,000 jobs.\nVox Media is also laying off a chunk of its workforce, and Fandom has cut a number of roles as well, including those at fellow media outlets GameSpot and Giant Bomb.\nThe post Riot Games lays off 46 employees amid ‘strategic shift’ appeared first on Destructoid.",

As expected, it was a massive success, and a tweet from HBO Max confirmed it: the show surpassed 10 million viewers within two days of its premiere, and that only accounts for the viewers in the United States, according to HBO. Those numbers are broken down into 4.7 million streams on premiere night last Sunday, January 15, which means an additional 5.3 viewers tuned in the following day. I'd bet a good percentage of those people saw the hype online and wanted to see what all the fuss was about, because the series has lit up social media like the Fourth of July this week.\nhttps://twitter.com/Variety/status/1615795010540302338\nWith numbers like that, The Last of Us has secured a spot as the second-most watched premiere of a show on HBO since 2010, second only to House of the Dragon with 9.98 million viewers. While The Last of Us had the benefit of a pre-built fanbase of gamers to flock to the streaming platform on opening night, House of the Dragon had the advantage of being a spin-off of another one of HBO's most successful series of all time: Game of Thrones.\nHBO has also stated that numbers tend to grow significantly in the weeks after a show has premiered, with only 20-40% of its total numbers coming from Sunday night viewership. This means The Last of Us can be expected to be seeing even bigger numbers as time goes on, and as a fan of the series myself, I can imagine it's only a matter of time before even the most hardened skeptics cave to the curiosity — especially when it comes to seeing the adaptations of the show's most iconic scenes that are still ahead.\nThe post The Last of Us HBO series hit a stunning 10 million viewers within 2 days of its premiere appeared first on Destructoid.",

General performance optimizations have been made across all platforms, and multiple issues where camera angles or paths could cause the player to fall through the ground have been fixed.\nPlayers should also no longer take damage when vaulting over obstacles, making the environment a little less of an enemy.

Now available to download on Nintendo Switch, the new patch brings a laundry list of balance tweaks, bug fixes, U.I. polishes, and much more.\nIt's difficult to know where to start when an update has this much coverage... There has been an array of buffs and nerfs to many tools in the Splatoon 3 arsenal, from damage, to spread, to ink consumption, to fire rate. The Dynamo Roller, Jet Squelcher, Sloshing Machine, Aerosprays MG & RG, and Nautilus 47 have all been tweaked, for better or worse, while sub-weapons and gear skills such as Angle Shooter and Ninja Squid have also seen minor overhauls.\n\"A lot of the adjustm…",

This allows the Maiden in Black to be posed in a variety of demure and evocative stances, bringing a sense of morose disquiet to anybody's bookshelf or work desk. The maiden comes packaged with a selection of alternate hands, as well as her huge, path-lighting torch. Three variants of her skirt are included, in order to facilitate both sitting and standing poses.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThazDMOKDyY&ab_channel=MAXFACTORYCHANNEL\nA rarity for the Figma format, Good Smile Co. has released a video of our girl, perhaps aware of the maiden's mammoth fan base and the likelihood that she will be one of the more popular Figmas.\nIf you would like to invite The Maiden in Black Figma into the warmth of your home, then you can pre-order her right now over at the official Good Smile Co. store and other import retailers. The Maiden retails for ¥12,800 (or roughly $93 USD) not including shipping or any potential custom charges. Unfortunately, it will take her a long time to make her way from The Nexus to your house, as global shipping is not expected until January 2024. Still, what a wonderful guest to ring in the new year.\nDemon's Souls is available now on PS5.\nThe post Demon Souls’ Maiden in Black is available to pre-order in Figma form appeared first on Destructoid.",

In fact, this tweet from the Fire Emblem Japanese account hard confirms more waves (six total). Out of this lot, I suspect Marth will be one of the most-purchased icons; as well potential classic cast members via the Emblem Ring system.

While the video series itself is region locked to Japan, that hasn't stopped the Pokemon community from distributing the codes themselves.\nSeveral codes have been distributed thus far from the channel, but the most recent bonus is arguably the most impactful: an Ability Capsule. As a reminder, this relatively expensive item goes for 100,000 Pokecoins at the Chansey Supply storefront, and allows Pokemon to swap between their potential abilities: which can be key for taking down tougher raids, or creating certain builds.\nOne option is to farm them from higher-end raids, but it's a vicious cycle; as you generally need high-end Pokemon for them, and getting Ability Capsules can make that happen. So consider this a little pick me up! Note that this code is live until February 28, so you have some time to enter it.\nThe code for a free Ability Capsule in Pokemon Scarlet & Violet\nT0KUSE1STUDY\n\nThe code READY4RA1D is also available from the same series, which grants players 20,000 League Points (LP) to use.

          "description": "Publisher believes demand still high for veteran hardware\nWhile rumors of a successor to the smash-selling platform, Nintendo Switch, simply refuse to die, it seems that Nintendo itself still has plenty of faith in the now six-year-old hybrid platform. In fact, according to a report by Bloomberg, the publisher is ramping up production of Switch units for 2023.\nAccording to Bloomberg's sources, Nintendo has already told its suppliers and production partners to prepare for an increase in unit manufacture for the coming fiscal year, which will begin in spring. The report suggests that Nintendo remains confident in the demand for Switch hardware, which it expects to remain high for at least the remainder of 2023. Additionally, the boosted production hopes to cover the spread, given that COVID-19 severely impacted all aspects of industry over the past two years.\nWith the launch of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom scheduled for May 12, it would not be surprising to see a limited edition themed Switch unit launched alongside the highly anticipated title — the sequel to one of the most popular Switch releases ever, 2017's The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. It remains to be seen whether Nintendo has the release schedule necessary to lure in players who are yet to already own a Switch, but given the fact that the publisher has shifted over 114 million consoles in the past six years, it would be prudent not to bet against it.\nNintendo Plans to Boost Switch Output to Meet Resilient Demand [Bloomberg]\nThe post Report: Nintendo to boost Switch production in 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "A harrowing journey to the end of the world\nI never get tired of a good narrative game, so when I see a trailer that looks good enough to grab my attention, I can't help but get excited about a potential new story-driven gem. That's absolutely the case when it comes to The Pale Beyond, a narrative polar exploration game that's set to release on February 24, 2023. The title was originally announced back in November of 2021, and its story will follow the crew of a vessel named The Temperance, who have set out on an expedition toward the South Pole in an attempt to discover the mystery of their lost sister ship, the Viscount, which set out on a journey to find the absolute magnetic South five years prior.\nhttps://youtu.be/PvvkUPPJc_E\nThe Pale Beyond's launch trailer shows off some of the game's foremost mechanics, like resource and morale management and survival simulation — one can imagine how those elements will tie into tough narrative choices the player must make for the survival of the crew. What really grabbed me about this game is its art style, from the painterly backdrops to the hand-drawn character portraits. Here's hoping that the gameplay experience will hold up against the gorgeous visuals.\nI'm a big fan of these harrowing, tension-filled \"journey\" narratives, and it's certainly not a story I've played in a game for a good while now, so I'm looking forward to checking out The Pale Beyond once it drops. If the game looks interesting to you as well and you want to get a taste before the release date, there's also a demo you can download on The Pale Beyond's Steam page right now.\nThe post Chilling narrative exploration game The Pale Beyond releases next month appeared first on Destructoid.",

Here's hoping that today's news is still something of a respite, despite the Definitive Edition's rough start.\nEither way, the trilogy is now available to purchase on Steam, and is also playable on the Steam Deck, which should be exciting to hear for at least some of the GTA diehards out there. Rockstar also stated that they'll be making the game available on the Epic Games Store later this month, so Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy — The Definitive Edition will be even more accessible to PC players soon enough.\nhttps://twitter.com/RockstarGames/status/1616138619273478146\nThis is the first time GTA 3, Vice City, and San Andreas will be available on Steam after they were delisted with the release of the Definitive Edition a few years ago -- players previously had to access them through Rockstar's own store if they wanted to play them on the PC at all over the past few years. The trilogy is still available to play on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X, but here's hoping the Steam Deck capability will make it up to any players who have dealt with any Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy — The Definitive Edition-caused headaches over the past few years.\nThe post The Grand Theft Auto trilogy is back on Steam, playable on Steam Deck appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Counting down the 10 Best Star Wars games isn't easy, with so many good games out there...\nWith over four decades of Star Wars games, many of which remain easily accessible to the general public, it can be difficult to narrow things down to such a short list. The quality assurance oversight historically from LucasArts, (Lucasfilm's now-defunct gaming division,) and now from Lucasfilm Games (the reformed modern division created by Disney and Lucasfilm), has ensured that developers and publishers put in the necessary time and effort into crafting enjoyable and successful Star Wars titles that don't tarnish the reputation of the corporate IP. That said, some games still clearly rise to the surface as being well beyond the usual fare...\n[caption id=\"attachment_358654\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"…",

          "description": "Little vegetable people living their little vegetable lives\nI am always on the hunt for a new cozy simulation game, because playing a relaxing city/life/community sim is one of my favorite ways to wind down after a long day. One upcoming title I've had my eye on is Gourdlets, a city-building simulator that has \"no objectives, no points, just building.\" Say no more — I know for a fact that this title is going to be right up my alley, especially with its pastel color palette and adorable vegetable villagers.\nBased on a new trailer that publisher AuntyGames posted, will be able to decorate their towns with all kinds of cute buildings, trees, flowers, crops, fences, and paths. Your villagers will also be able to take part in cozy activities like roasting marshmallows, building sand castles, and the simulator staple: fishing. You'll be able to \"Watch the population of gourdlets grow and interact with the town as you create it,\" according to the game's Steam page, and chill out as you \"watch the little gourdlets live their little lives.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_LoaTunj4\nI'm excited to see a new entry in the cozy simulator genre that's more of an open-ended, sandboxy thing as opposed to a game with a more rigid quest structure. I've been having a blast with Disney's Dreamlight Valley, but I know after binging dozens of hours of a game that requires a good deal of grinding for materials, a more relaxed experience will be a welcome respite. Gourdlets' gameplay and art style also remind me of another excellent city-builder called Townscaper, which shares in its bright colors and laid-back tone.\nGourdlets doesn't have a release window yet, but the extended demo is available to download on Steam right now!\nThe post Cozy city-builder Gourdlets gets a new trailer, demo appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "We missed you, 1v1\nWarzone 2.0 brought about a whole host of changes to Call of Duty's beloved battle royale mode, but the most divisive of them all has to be the new version of the Gulag, which changed from a 1v1 fight to a 2v2 with the introduction of the sequel. As if it wasn't already hard enough contending with two enemies instead of one, especially if you have a teammate who is AFK, uncooperative, etc., they also added a Jailer with a minigun for you to contend with, too. It's clear to me why this was one of the least popular changes that came along with Warzone 2.0.\nThankfully we won't have to put up with it for very much longer, though, because Infinity Ward has announced on Twitter that they're reverting the Gulag back to its former 1v1 glory. This change is scheduled to be implemented along with the Season 2 update for both Warzone 2.0 and Modern Warfare II, which we learned yesterday has been delayed by two weeks. I guess this gives us yet another reason to look forward to the game's second season, along with bug fixes, a new Raid episode, and new game modes, just to name a few of the upcoming features.\nhttps://twitter.com/InfinityWard/status/1616133411189710848\nSeason 2 is officially dropping on February 15, as per a tweet from the Call of Duty Twitter account yesterday, so we only have to deal with the 2v2 shenanigans for a little while longer. It's nice that they wanted to branch out and try something new to keep things feeling fresh, but unfortunately, this turned out to be more of a \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\" situation.\nThe post Season 2 of Warzone 2.0 is bringing back the 1v1 Gulag appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Pokémon Scarlet and Violet arrived on Switch last November, and the Pokémon Trading Card Game is ready to leave Galar for the open world of Paldea. That first Scarlet and Violet expansion arrives this March (alongside various changes, including a price increase), but first, we have one more Sword and Shield expansion to get to.\nPokémon Trading Card Game: Sword & Shield – Crown Zenith, out this week, adds more than 160 new cards, including 3 new Radiant Pokémon, five Pokémon VMax cards, eight Pokémon VStar cards, and 70 cards with special Galarian Gallery artwork. The Pokémon Company sent over some of the products in this special expansion, and we cracked them to see what we could pull.\nThough I'm frustrated you can't buy these as individual booster packs (they're only available in larger packs like the Elite Trainer Box and special collections), I absolutely love several of the cards I pulled. In particular, the full-art cards are absolutely striking. I'm very happy with the Radiant Charizard, and the Pikachu and Lucario cards might be among my favorites of those respective Pokémon. You can see the full gallery below.\n\nPokémon Trading Card Game: Sword & Shield – Crown Zenith arrives starting on January 20 with the Elite Trainer Box and Collections starring Regieleki V or Regidrago V. New Tins and Collections will arrive through May. For all things Pokémon Trading Card Game, head to our special hub by clicking the banner below!",

The game received a special edition release with added in content in 2008 with FES, and was then re-released a third time for PSP in 2010 with the most added content, but some modifications made to run on Sony's handheld platform.\nPersona 4 followed – again a mild hit – but then Persona 5 came along and cemented the franchise's reputation as one of the best RPGs ever made. Fans who discovered the series with 5 have wanted to figure out what they've been missing out on, and longtime players have been demanding the re-release of 3 so that a larger audience could play what many call their favorite. After arguably too long, Atlus is finally ready to make that happen with the re-re-re-release of Persona 3 on modern consoles January 19.\nJoin Kyle Hilliard and Wesley LeBlanc as they look at the game's first true dungeon and chat about perhaps the most controversial Persona game in the series.\n\n\nFor more previews of some of the biggest games of 2022 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for NGTs about Vengeful Guardian: Moonrider, Fire Emblem Engage, Clive 'N' Wrench, Inkulinati, Outer Terror, and more.",

One of these is Frost Fatales, an all-women speedrunning event, which will take place from February 26 - March 4, 2023 on Twitch. Since it was founded in 2010, the organization has raised over $43 million for charity.\nAGDQ was initially set to be in person but was moved online due to COVID concerns. Their summer event, Summer Games Done Quick, will be held from May 28 - June 4, though it's unclear whether the event will also take place in person.\nDid you watch this year's AGDQ? What were your favorite runs? Let us know in the comments!",

However, FF16 producer Naoki Yoshida isn't sure why. \nDuring a recent Final Fantasy XIV stream, Yoshida, who is a director on that game, was asked about rumors surrounding a PC version of FF16, and he responded, \"I don't know where the notion of a PC version releasing six months after the game is out came from as none of us have ever said that,\" according to a translator, as reported by Eurogamer. He followed it up with two instances urging fans to buy the PS5 version. \nAccording to a translation by Siliconera, Yoshida also said, \"There's been talk that the PC version will come out, but no one on the team has said anything about the PC version. I wonder why people assume the PC version will arrive six months after [the PS5 version], so just go ahead and buy a PS5.\" \nThe talk of a PC version of the game stems from a promotional PlayStation 5 video released last year that says in small print that FF16 will be a \"PS5 exclusive for six months.\" Some extrapolated from this small print that a PC release of the game will come after that six months of exclusivity is up, but if Yoshida's recent comments are any indication, the team has nothing to say in regards to a PC version. \nFinal Fantasy XVI hits PlayStation 5 on June 22. While waiting for more information, watch this \"Ambition\" trailer that reveals more about Valisthea's kingdoms, dominants, and eikons, and then check out our interview with Yoshida about the game's boss fights. \n[Source: Eurogamer]\nAre you picking up Final Fantasy XVI on PS5 or waiting for the rumored PC release?

In fact, nearly 40 years after the first superhero video game, many developers still struggle to create worthwhile experiences using some of the biggest names in entertainment today.\nWhile not all superhero games are monumental duds like Superman on Nintendo 64, many tend to deliver middling, forgettable experiences. However, a select few that defy the stereotype to become superb titles we still look back on fondly as not only great superhero games, but terrific video games in their own rights.\nWhile the superhero films of today are often criticall…",

And those feelings vary depending on who you are talking to about this topic. I think of games like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild when someone brings up weapon durability, as it was a hotly debated aspect of its release (I didn't mind it at all, personally). \nLove it or hate it, weapon durability is a feature that will likely never go away in games, and that's okay because when it's done right, it can be a helpful way to push players toward something new. In 2011's Dead Island, weapon durability was a big part of the experience, and that feature will return in Dead Island 2 when it hits PlayStation and Xbox consoles, and PC, on April 2…",

Here's what Druckmann told THR specifically: \"We have no plans to tell any stories beyond adapting the games. We won't run into the same issue as Game of Thrones since The Last of Us Part: II doesn't end on a cliffhanger.\" \n\n\nDruckmann and TV series writer Craig Mazin have mentioned that a second season of this show might cover the events of The Last of Us Part II (personally, I think The Last of Us Part II could cover two seasons of television). Despite the duo not wanting the show to go beyond the games, there might be a way for the show to cover more ground after the events of The Last of Us Part II. If Naughty Dog were to develop a theoretical The Last of Us Part III, it wouldn't be surprising if the HBO show covered that down the road. Chances seem pretty good considering Druckmann told THR that there is \"more story to tell\" in the world of The Last of Us games. \nMazin also touched on his desire not to extend the show beyond the games in the THR interview, as noted by GameSpot, stating that he doesn't \"have any interest in a spinning-plates-go-on-forever show.\" \n\"When it becomes a perpetual motion machine, it just can't help but get kind of...stupid,\" he continued. \"Endings mean everything to me.\" \nFor more about The Last of Us on HBO, read our interview with Joel actor Pedro Pascal and Druckmann about the changes made for this TV show. Check out this new piece of concept art from The Last of Us multiplayer game that Naughty Dog is currently developing after that. \n[Source: GameSpot via The Hollywood Reporter]\nWhat scene are you most excited to see in The Last of Us on HBO?

This side-scrolling action title boasts plenty of satisfying action thanks to Kai’s fun melee combat, nimble platforming abilities, and his signature grappling hook, which he uses to traverse levels as well as yank and toss enemies. Sporting great 16-bit art and a strong soundtrack, Gravity Circuit is worth keeping an eye on for fans of classic throwbacks. \nJoin editors Wesley LeBlanc and Marcus Stewart as they explore Gravity Circuit’s free Steam demo and discuss why it may be one of the year’s most exciting indie gems.\n\n\nFor more previews of some of the biggest games of 2022 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for NGTs about Fire Emblem Engage, Clive 'N' Wrench, Inkulinati, Outer Terror, and more.",

That story is about the GT Academy contest, which was a real contest held between 2008 and 2016 by Sony and Nissan. Winners were given entrance into Nissan's Driver Development Program, as noted by Video Games Chronicle. The film appears to be telling the tale of someone who won entrance into this program and then went on to become a real success in the racing world. \nCheck out the Gran Turismo sneak peek for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, this sneak peek is a mix of what appears to be movie footage and behind-the-scenes footage, with stars like Harbour, Barnet, and Bloom talking about their excitement for the film. \nGran Turismo hits theaters later this year on August 11. \nAlongside this sneak peek, Sony also revealed that Gran Turismo 7, the latest in the long-running series released last year, will be getting an update that makes the game playable on its upcoming PSVR2 platform. \nWhile waiting to learn more about this Gran Turismo movie, read about Project Leonardo, a new customizable accessibility controller kit PlayStation unveiled yesterday and then read about how the PlayStation 5 has surpassed 30 million units sold. \nAre you excited about this Gran Turismo movie?

With a team led by Vinit Agarwal, Joe Pettinati, and Anthony Newman, the project is shaping up to be a fresh, new experience from our studio, but one rooted in Naughty Dog’s passion for delivering incredible stories, characters, and gameplay.”\nNaughty Dog also shares a new piece of concept art, posted in full below, which is the first new material of the game since it released the first concept asset last June. It depicts two survivors heading toward a dilapidated cruise ship. \nThough we’ll be learning more about the game this year, it’s still unknown if Naughty Dog plans to launch it in 2023. That would be fitting given the anniversary, but we'll have to wait and see over the coming months. Until then, be sure to check out this feature on how The Last of Us Part 1 proves there's no such thing as a faithful remake.",
