          "description": "Available handheld or Chicory dickory docked.\nThere are few things more personal than art. That is, the art produced by an artist. Obviously. Even in its most commercial, populist form — including when it’s a small part of a much larger product — the work of an individual artist is ultimately recognisable, whether from obvious sweeping traits or tiny little consistencies that come to define them. Chicory: A Colorful Tale’s extremely difficult job is to translate that sense of ownership, the pocket creative universe of the artist, into… well… a video game. It’s not the most efficient medium for this kind of individuality, for creating and owning something one-of-a-kind, but Chicory – against all odds – manages to pull it off. Surely, though, it can’t also be a charming adventure game on top of a paean to, and canvas for, creativity? It can! It is!!\nYou play as a little dog creature who happens to be gainfully employed as the janitor of the elusive Wielder, they who, er, wield a magic paintbrush which you’ll be unsurprised to learn ends up in your own hands. One day, the present Wielder – the titular Chicory – appears to have gone missing and left the Brush behind. More pressingly, indeed, all the colour in the world appears to have vanished. Your player character, Double Sausage and Egg McMuffin (they’re actually named after your favourite food, so this handle will vary), takes up the Brush and sets out into the world of Picnic to get to the bottom of what’s going on.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "A game about time deserves to go down in history.\nOur very own Zion Grassl recently had the privilege of finishing Chrono Trigger for the very first time, and even 26 years after release he's utterly blown away. To celebrate this accomplishment Zion, Jon and special guest Kevin Kenson decided to sit down and praise the game for over an hour. And trust us, there's a lot more we could have said.\nHowever speaking the good word of this classic is about all we can do as there are very few ways for gamers to play this pivotal RPG for themselves. In 26 years there have only ever been 4 releases; Super Nintendo (which skipped Europe), PlayStation (also skipped Europe), Nintendo DS & the initially controversial but largely remedied Steam release. If you primarily play on console, there's a high chance you've never had the opportunity to buy Chrono Trigger and that should frankly be a crime.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "When I was younger I watched a nature documentary narrated by David Attenborough (I realise that doesn't narrow it down) and in this nature documentary David told me about a cave. It is a very big cave, and every night a huge colony of bats come screaming out of the entrance. They spend the day clinging to the ceiling of this big cave, and all their bat poo falls down and has become a towering heap carpeting the floor.\nBut then David said look, the carpet is moving. And it turns out that the whole bottom of the cave is covered in cockroaches and giant centipedes. And if ever a small baby bat or an old injured bat falls, it is eaten alive by this hoard of chittering insects. This nature documentary haunted me, for it was the worst thing I could imagine happening.\nAnyway, Nate has been to that cave and he's going to tell us all about it for this episode of our supporters only podcast, The Nate Files. Thanks for being a supporter, pals!\nRead more",

Ever a broad church, 2021's seen enough releases to keep ten of me busy, from the easy-going Legion War to the month-consuming Shadow Empire. I don't know about you, but my personal \"to play\" list is out of control.\nAnd yet, while we've had plenty to enjoy this year, it's felt like a period of build-up to something bigger. I'm not one for looking forward. If a game's not out yet it tends to disappear from my mind, making room for a hundred other recent releases in this age of plenty. That I've less interest in looking back over this year than I do pondering the next suggests that maybe we're in for something special in the coming twelve months. Or perhaps it's just been a rough one and I'm very sleep deprived and don't want to think about 2021. Either way, let's have a look at what's in store for strategy fans in 2022, yeah?\nRead more",

          "description": "I know almost nothing about Alfred Hitchcock. He’s the kind of archetypal director whose work I’ve been exposed to in bits and pieces without ever actually sitting down to watch one of his films in full. All of that is to say that, upon starting Alfred Hitchcock - Vertigo the game, I was in no position to judge whether it was a faithful adaptation of the film or to recognize all but the most obvious illusions to Hitchcock’s body of work (look, birds!). That’s okay, though, because as it turns out, Vertigo is an original story based on a collage of Hitchcockian concepts, not a direct adaption of the 1958 film by the same name.\nVertigo the game follows author Ed Miller as he grapples with a debilitating case of vertigo–a condition that leaves him unable to stand as the world appears to spin around him–and paralyzing guilt over the death of his daughter and her mother, Faye, after their car falls off a bridge into a ravine below. With Ed bed ridden, it’s up to Dr. Julia Lomas, psychologist and psychiatrist, and Sheriff Nick Reyes to unravel the mystery of what really happened, and whether Faye and his daughter even exist. My thoughts on how Vertigo goes about telling this story are... complicated. \nRead more",

Games that were delayed by the pandemic last year finally got their due in 2021, but in turn many of the releases we were expecting this year have inevitably slipped into 2022. The pandemic has affected games of all sizes this year, and I don't think it will go down in the history books as one of our all-time greats. There were still plenty of fantastic games that came out this year, mind, and we're still counting down our absolute favourites over in our Advent Calendar. \nThat said, I do think 2021 will prove to be a pivotal year for RPS - and not just because I stole Graham's key card and changed the locks on the front door of the Treehouse. It's been a year of immense change here at the site, so I wanted to take some time to reflect on everything that's happened this year, and look forward to what we've got in store for 2022.\nRead more",

If you didn't have a chance to play it earlier this year, it's now free on the Epic Game Store until tomorrow.

PC folks can finally try out the Baldur's Gate that console users first experienced 20 years ago.

The House Of Reckoning is a series of rooms where contrived artificial battlefields have been constructed inside an alien fortress.

As space haulers Rani and Becks touch down on a forgotten planet in search of a strange energy signal, the place is absolutely gummed up with the stuff. It oozes and throbs in the caves, plains and rivers of this once vibrant landscape, and the urge to suck it all up into Rani's chunky power glove (a literal hand vac in this case) is overwhelmingly strong. After all, when it turns the ground black and saps the world of all its colour, this is one case of Extremely Bad Vibes you'll want to remedy as soon as possible. \nYour reward for scooping up all the gunk in any given area is the kind of graphical wizardry video games do best. A burst of light, a shruum of sound, and the world is instantly transformed back to its former glory. Despite its gloopy namesake, The Gunk is frequently stunning, its soft pastels and coral-esque flora showing such an eye for jaw-dropping visuals that it's hard to believe this is SteamWorld developer Image & Form's first ever 3D video game. If this is what they've been holding back on all these years, then their upcoming action adventure SteamWorld Headhunter should be a real treat for the old eyeballs. That said, while Image & Form have clearly navigated their 2D to 3D transition from an art perspective, their typical flair for adding their own spin to different genres has been less successful. There's a lot to like about this 3D action platformer, but it's missing that spark to really make it sing.\nRead more",

The action-platformer's plot sounds great too, it drops you into Radlandia on a search for the skate gods. Skate gods! Don't anger them, kiddos, they'll break your collarbones.\r\n\n \nRead more",

That’s one thing I learned from my time with this kung-fu caper. To keep my fists flowing, I needed to be patient, and not mash the buttons. Seriously, slap those buttons with zero thought and you’re dead.\nDeath in Sifu means you age, and if you die lots, you age faster. Hit 70 and you won’t be rising from the dirt again. Instead, you'll have to start your quest for vengeance over from the beginning. While it can be tempting to cling onto your youth for this reason alone, I actually liked growing old, with my beard and my harder-hitting attacks. Not only do you develop a relationship with your body in Sifu, but your trips to the afterlife also help you master its myriad of moves. Sifu really does get better with age.\nRead more",

First: I got the opportunity to dive into Rumbleverse's action-packed 40-player matches far earlier than I'd anticipated, as part of a one day early look at the game. I downloaded and installed it in short order, and jumped right in. Two hours later, at 1am in the morning as the servers shut down, I happened across a second, far more unexpected thing. I found myself absolutely desperate to play more. I've sunk thousands of hours into Apex Legends, Fortnite, Plunkbat, Hunt: Showdown, Warzone, and various other behemoths of the genre.

          "description": "Paralives Studio has given us all an early Christmas present, in the form of a look at Paralives' character creation tool. The video is pre-alpha footage and it emphasises that this is still a work in progress, but the character creator (called Paramaker, a name chosen by the game's community) looks ridiculously detailed even so.\nParalives is a life sim game that may even have the chops to topple The Sims' supremacy when it launches. This video of the character creation is the beefiest look at Paralives we've had for a while. Marvel as the Paras change musculature, fat distribution and weight before your eyes. Importantly, you can give your Paras some sick tattoos and amazing patterned jackets, because what's the point making a tiny puppet to play with if they're not well cool?\nRead more",

Add in gameplay mechanics like puzzles, shooting, dancing, or the use of electric instruments that can be played with a group of friends, and you’ve got a genre that easily becomes a house favorite. While the music genre is not as clear-cut as it used to be – remember when it was basically “Do you want to play Guitar Hero or Rock Band?” – there are many more creative renditions of these experiences, so the scene has never been better than now. However, with the abundance of options now afforded to fans of music games, picking out the one to play can be tough. This list has you covered, though.

But now, some fans can recreate that feeling in real life with the new Pokémon Collection from Secretlab. The gaming chair company has given its Titan Evo 2022 Series the very best makeover, with the ergonomic seats sporting two of the franchise's most recognized mascots. One of the offerings features an adorable image of Pikachu, with yellow lettering and accents to match. The other orange-and-blue-laced option in this fresh collection is packing a Zard. Both chairs come with a pair of pokéballs stitched into the upper left corner, the creatures' pokédex number in the right, and a handful of themed, custom stitching throughout. \nBut before you go off to try and snag one of these functional gaming collectibles, we have good and bad news. The bad? Secretlab's collection is only available in Japan right now while supplies last. So, it would seem like anyone outside that country is out of luck for now. However, there is a glimmer of hope as the manufacturer has provided a link on its website that will allow you to \"register interest.\" We hope this means that – given enough people click the link and provide their email – Secretlab will consider selling these unique products around the globe. So if you'd like to get more news on the chairs and hopefully bring the Kanto-region pokémon to your region, check out the collection's official website. \nClick image thumbnails to view larger version",

          "description": "New year, new Games with Gold lineup, and this upcoming month's titles all seem to have a theme. We are looking forward and backward with a slew of games that run the gamut from ultra-futuristic to retro-futuristic. Come January, Xbox owners with Xbox Live Gold membership or that subscribe to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate will be able to grab the titles listed below for free:\nNeuroVoider: Available January 1 to 31\nAground: Available January 16 to February 15\nRadiant Silvergun: Available January 1 to 15\nSpace Invaders Infinity Gene: Available January 16 to 31\nAs usual, the games are only available for a limited time, so make sure you catch anything you are interested in before it leaves the service. The first up on the list is NeuroVoider, a twin-shooter RPG that sets waves of robotic baddies after you. You'll have to take each of them down to end the neverending war that's been tearing up the cyber futuristic world. Coming in the same window as NeuroVoider during the first half of the month is Radiant Silvergun. The vertical scrolling shoot 'em up was first released in 1998 but has been shined up for modern players.\nIn the back half of the month, players will be able to pick up Aground and Space Invaders Infinity Gene. The second title, a fresh twist on the well-known Space Invaders franchise, is only available until the end of January, so pick it up as soon as you can. However, Aground, a game focused on building and crafting set amongst the stars, will be available until the middle of February. \nWhile the end of the year is fast approaching, we still have a little bit more time left in December. So, if you have not picked up last month's Games with Gold, you can pick those up now. This month's free titles included The Escapists 2, Tropico 5: Penultimate Edition, Orcs Must Die, and Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet. There are some good titles in there, so don't miss out if you have Xbox Live Gold or Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.\nWhat do you think about 2022's opening Games with Gold?

Much of the footage isn't new, following the first trailer that was released back in October pretty closely. However, this new look at the upcoming adaptation does give us a few fresh tidbits, including a little more backstory on Moncada, the movie's antagonist played by Antonio Banderas. It seems, his family did more than search for the unbelievable fortune central to the story, they found it but were then betrayed. We'll have to see how this ties into Nathan Drake (played by Tom Holland) and Victor \"Sully\" Sullivan's (played by Mark Wahlberg) plans to recover the glittering treasure. \nOne of the biggest reveals of the trailer came at the end when we get our first glimpse of Sully in the film with his characteristic mustache. In the games, Sully's facial hair is one of his defining features, and one that Uncharted fans immediately noticed was missing in early character reveals. While it felt strange to see the mentor without it, the change made some sense considering this movie takes place before the Naughty Dog series. However, it looks like Sully won't stay clean-shaven throughout the whole film, and you can check out the reveal, along with the rest of the new details in the trailer above. \nSony Entertainment Picture's Uncharted will release in theatres on February 18. Recent posters found on Fandango showcase some pirate-worthy imagery, of which we see more in today's trailer. This led some to believe that the upcoming movie may have ties to Uncharted 4: A Theif's End, which features a graveyard of similar-looking vessels. However, it's hard to tell exactly what connections we will see between the games and the upcoming adaptation. There's only two more months until we find out.",

Tales of Arise was Bandai Namco’s opportunity to enact meaningful change and enter a new console generation soaring. The developers didn’t let the opportunity pass by, rising to the challenge and breaking franchise sales records in the process. Tales of Arise took interesting risks and made smart improvements, resulting in a fantastic RPG full of endearing characters, intense battles, and rewarding exploration.\nIn its 26-year run, the Tales series has always had a passionate fanbase, but Tales of Arise helped expand the franchise’s reach and elevate its established formula to make it one of the best entries in years. While retaining the series’ essence, Bandai Namco brought in a new visual style, more strategic combat, and a mature story about warring nations. The latter especially made its mark for how it tackled socio-political issues, like racism, authoritarianism, and mental illness. Read more...",

          "description": "It's been just around two years since Telltale Games announced its return. Populated by some of the former studio's staff and led by a new team, the company announced a follow-up to The Wolf Among Us during The Game Awards 2019. Then things seemed to go quiet, leading many to speculate on how the newly reformed studio was doing. However, Telltale has recently been very vocal about the status of its projects and the studio itself. This most recent post from Telltale's official Twitter account runs down a list of the studio's recent milestones and what it hopes to achieve in the near future. It begins, \"Telltale is back.\" Then the post moves on to assure readers that the company, while trying to stay true to the Telltale legacy, is changing things up and steering clear of the problems that plagued the original studio.\nPerhaps the most eye-catching part of the message comes near the end, in the section detailing what comes next. It seems like we will be hearing more about The Wolf Among Us 2 soon. As you can read below, the post states the team will be ready to reveal more news \"early next year when we can go deeper into things.\"\nWhile we are excited to hear news about Telltale's upcoming sequel, the studio has more projects on the horizon. Announced just weeks ago at The Game Awards, The Expanse: A Telltale Series will be an adaptation of the popular Amazon TV show and is being co-developed with Life is Strange: True Colors studio Deck Nine. The two developers have a strong storytelling history, giving us a lot to look forward to in the title.",

My days at work were mostly spent alone in a dark projection booth above a corporate auditorium. To spice up my evenings and force some human interaction on myself, I started playing Magic: The Gathering at a local game shop. I spent multiple days a week there, learning how to draft, build decks, and catch onto the lingo and language of the game. Slowly, I incorporated myself into the small group of regulars, and day by day, I felt less alone.\nWhile shuffling decks and slinging spells against these new acquaintances, I noticed shared mannerisms and social archetypes people took on within my little corner of the Magic community.

          "description": "Brandon Sanderson, the famed author behind fantasy series Mistborn and The Stormlight Archive series, has revealed he’s working on a video game. \nThis news comes by way of a recent blog post he made titled “State of the Sanderson 2021,” which, like previous “State of” posts made by the author, details what he has going on in his career. He mentions feature films, TV series, and more, but he also quickly divulges that he’s been working on a game for a while and we might be seeing it soon. \n“I’ve been working on a video game for several years, and I suspect it will be announced this year,” Sanderson writes. “So commence speculation.” \nSanderson’s post includes a note that says the game is not based on one of his properties and is instead something new he built with the team he’s working with on this project. He also said that people will recognize the company developing the game but playfully suggests it's “probably not the one you’re thinking of right now,” nor is it “that other one either.” \nAnd that’s all Sanderson had to say about this game. Sanderson entering the video game scene would be quite a treat for fans of the author, whose only other experience in games is minimal. He wrote a novella e-book in 2011 for Epic Games Infinity Blade series called “Infinity Blade: Awakening.” (Editor's note: he has also worked on some fiction for Magic: The Gathering. – JC) However, as the author notes that this game won’t be based on one of his own series, those holding out for a Mistborn RPG will have to continue their wait. \nPerhaps this development will go so well that Sanderson decides to greenlight a Mistborn game of some kind. While not a full game, you can technically get a taste of Mistborn in the form of a game by way of Fortnite, which recently sold a skin based on Kelsier. Be sure to check out Sanderson’s entire “State of” post for more information about what the author is up to. \nAre you excited to see the game Sanderson has been working on?

This new settlement acts as an onboarding area to get players up to speed with the game’s new mechanics. It is Aloy's last stop before she heads to the Forbidden West. These screens also provide a view of a market and tavern to show off the more lively locales.\nLastly, there's a look at a new machine called the Burrower, which is a successor to Horizon Zero Dawn's Watcher. This common recon machine can tunnel underground and resurface in unexpected locations. When it senses danger, it emits a high-pitched sound to call allies and stun enemies.  According to game director Mathijs de Jonge: \"We wanted to add even more character and locomotion to the machines in Horizon Forbidden West, so the Burrowers are very similar to otters or weasels: flexible, quick, and pretty ferocious!\"\nClick image thumbnails to view larger version\n \n                                                                                                             \n\nWhat do you think of the new screens?

What’s more, there are ten free rewards for all players to earn, and earning them is simple: play a match of Arena or Big Team Battle. That’s it. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\n“Rewards will be unlocked over time, meaning they will not all be available to grab on day one,” a Halo Waypoint blog post about the event reads. “Think of Winter Contingency like your in-game Halo advent calendar: you’ll unlock one reward each day, with the event running through the morning of January 4, 2022. To be clear: While the daily rewards conclude on December 30, what this means is you’ll have several extra days to catch up on any items that you may have missed.”\nFor example, if you didn’t play a match yesterday, you’re one day behind, but because the event lasts until January 4, you’ll earn your final reward on December 31 (assuming you play a match every day in between now and then). \nSpeaking of rewards here’s what you can expect: \nDay 1: Wild Justice nameplate\nDay 2: Peppermint Laughter armor coating\nDay 3: UA/Tatius shoulder left pad\nDay 4: UA/Tatius shoulder right pad\nDay 5: Peppermint Laughter MA40 Assault Rifle weapon coating\nDay 6: Snowmageddon backdrop\nDay 7: Navlogcom nameplat\nDay 8: Peppermint Laughter MK50 Sidekick weapon coating\nDay 9: Myesel ammo pouch\nDay 10: Sunset Contessa armor coating\nIf you’ve already nabbed your daily reward today and need something to do, check out the official Game Informer Halo Infinite review. Then, give our breakdown of everything available in the Halo Infinite shop this week (including a very Iron Man-esque armor coating and cat ears) a look. \nAre you excited about Winter Contingency?

Here's the list:\nGrand Theft Auto V: Premium Edition\nGrand Theft Auto IV: Complete Edition\nMax Payne 3\nL.A. Noire\nBully: Scholarship Edition\nIf you already own those games through Rockstar's launcher, you won't be able to redeem a second copy.

That happened in 2012’s Assassin’s Creed 3. Assassin’s Creed Origins would be released on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC five years later. As the name implies, its story represents the origin of the Assassin Brotherhood (or at least what would one day become the Brotherhood).

Commander Shepard is tasked to lead a team on a suicide mission, and the choices made during it could lead to a beloved teammate losing their life. This mission can be completed without any losses (a strategy we detail in a handy flowchart), but most players lose one or two characters two during their first playthrough.\nMany of you took on this mission for the first time in Mass Effect Legendary Edition. Following the game's release, Electronic Arts and BioWare collected player data from this mission and have revealed the survival rate for each squad member.  This info is a small part of Electronic Arts' extensive, numbers-filled year-in-review.\nAs the numbers show, the fan-favorite Garrus often lived to see another day, making it through the suicide mission in 98 percent of players' attempts. The loveable singer Mordin died the most, surviving in just 90 percent of players' games. You can see all of the survival rates in the image below:\nElectronic Arts' also revealed the most liked squadmates from the Legendary Edition, and they are not who you would think. Garrus is third on that list, trailing Kaidan and Ashley, as one and two. A quarter of players also apparently didn't have the time to change the name of their Commander Shepard, which defaults to John/Jane. The numbers show 23 percent of players played the game under one of these names.\nIf you still haven't played through the Mass Effect trilogy, there's no better way to do it than through Legendary Edition. Kimberley Wallace gave this collection a review score of 9 out of 10, and said: \"Even all these years later, Commander Shepard is a powerful force that lives up to their iconic status, and the trilogy is still captivating and worth your time.\"",

He wields a katana for a weapon, but more importantly, he has a spooky ghost living in his arm, making the appendage glow with a spectral blue hue.

One shot revealed Ghostblade attacking the unannounced Mechanic, while another has people thinking they saw the Troubleshooter Agent variant, though that one is more speculative.

What’s more, the Yuffie Intermission DLC is available at a discounted price for a limited time.\nStarting this Wednesday...\n@FinalFantasy VII Remake via @PlayStation Plus will be able to upgrade to the PS5 version of the game.\npic.twitter.com/mnkCIRR586…",

          "description": "A new Mystery Gift event for the latest Pokémon games, Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl (BDSP), is now live. \nThis news comes by way of Serebii.net, which reported that the mystery gift event is now live for all players. Unfortunately, it doesn’t offer something like the shiny Zacia and Zamazenta recently distributed via Mystery Gift in Pokémon Sword and Shield. Instead of an actual Pokémon, this event is giving players some statues for their secret bases. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nMore specifically, the Mystery Gift code, MERRYCHR1STMAS, will give all players a jade-colored statue of Pacharisu, Lucario, Rhyperior, Electivire, and Glaceon. The smaller statues such as that of Pacharisu and Glaceon are quite cute, but if you’re looking for something more intimidating for your base, the Rhyperior and Electivire statues have you covered. The Rhyperior statue, in particular, is massive, standing nearly twice as tall as your player character. \nPlayers have until December 25 to redeem this Mystery Gift. \nSerebii.net also points out another Mystery Gift event that’s currently ongoing. From now until May 22, 2022, players can enter the code BDSPUNDERGROUND to get statues of Turtwig, Chimchar, and Piplup – the starters of BDSP. \nFor more about BDSP, check out our thoughts on it in Game Informer’s Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl review and then check out Game Informer’s list of the top 25 Pokémon in Diamond and Pearl.

          "description": "Yesterday, acclaimed writer George R.R. Martin (A Song of Ice and Fire) took to his blog to make a few comments about his role in the development of From Software’s upcoming Elden Ring. While the blog is short, the author is clear that his work on Elden Ring took place years ago, and focused on worldbuilding the fantastical realms that players will be investigating come February. In the blog, Martin comments that video games aren’t really his thing – but then goes on to say he played some old-school strategy games like Master of Orion, Romance of the Three Kingdoms, and Railroad Tycoon. Apparently Martin has some excellent taste with the games he chose to play back in the day! \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nMartin’s post is pretty clear, in that he worked on worldbuilding for the realms of Elden Ring. Exactly how this translates to the final game is unknown, but with what we saw in the network test, the world is full of discovery, even in that small slice. While the core foundational tale of the Tarnished and The Lands Between appear to have some significant similarities to the Dark Souls series right now, the world itself and much of that history is yet unknown, so we’ll have to wait and see exactly what happens. Martin also notes how video games have become bigger than films in the entertainment world these days. You can check out the entire post over on Martin’s official blog here. Martin also notes that Elden Ring looks “incredible.” On that final point, I’m inclined to agree.\nElden Ring is scheduled to arrive on February 25th on Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC. Are you looking forward to it?",
