It may not match the high-speed hijinks of kart racers starring Mario, Crash Bandicoot, or Sonic the Hedgehog, nor does it hit the same destructive highs of Burnout or the high-fidelity, simulative thrill found in other platforms' exclusive driving games, Forza and Gran Turismo. Instead, you just go fast and feel good doing it. In other words, Horizon Chase 2 is arcade-y fun, and good at pretty much exactly what its title implies, though not much more, and it hits some bumps in the road on Switch.\nLike Aquiris' predecessor, Horizon Chase Turbo, Horizon Chase 2 is a throwback to a bygone arcade era; the only thing that matters is that horizon and the finish line that lies somewhere beyond. There's no gimmick or catch. Everything around you becomes a blur as you hit dizzying speeds as you race through low-fidelity courses offering cute renditions of places like Morocco, Japan, the Continental U.S., and Brazil.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

In 11 bit Studio's forthcoming sequel, Frostpunk 2, the apocalypse is yesterday's news. Now you're dealing with \"what happens when you survive the un-survivable,\" as the game's co-director and design director Jakub Stokalski neatly puts it when I sit down for a hands off presentation at this year's Gamescom. And to do this, Frostpunk 2 is going big, measuring its time not in days, but weeks, months and even years.\n\"If we want to show the evolution of societies and different utopias/dystopias, we need breathing room,\" says Stokalski. \"And this breathing room really is in the scale, both in the physical sense but also in the sense of time. It's difficult to show meaningful social change in the space of a month, so the time ticks now in weeks and months, and in a long playthrough you'll get up into years, so you can see the consequences of your choices.\"\nRead more",

          "description": "In another reality, 2003's The Simpsons: Hit & Run — an action-adventure game that was by then the show's 22nd video game adaptation — might have slid quietly into obscurity. So why is it, then, that we can't seem to let it go? On YouTube, the game frequently resurfaces via longplays, speedruns, and retrospective essays that garner respectable amounts of views year after year. A few months ago, the game's lead designer told GamesRadar that he would support an official remake, mentioning that Hit & Run continues to be The Simpsons' most popular video game adaptation on Metacritic.\nYet Hit & Run's sustained relevance is, on its surface, a bit of an enigma. You'd be hard-pressed to find the game included in any critical canons or best-of lists, and there's hardly been a shortage of T-rated open-world games since its release. But for many, the game isn't just a source of nostalgia today; it was an introduction to a wholly new form of in-game self-expression. I looked into the still-growing community keeping it alive today.\nRead more",

Except these are currently limited to tedious magic shooters Forspoken and Immortals of Aveum, which is less great. \nRegardless, this could be a major moment for basically any modern graphics card that isn’t an Nvidia RTX 40 series model. FSR 3’s Fluid Motion Frames system works in a broadly similar manner to DLSS 3, piecing together whole new frames outside of the usual GPU rendering pipeline and slipping them onto your screen between the 'real' frames. The result (in theory – I’ll be trying FSR 3 out in depth next week) is higher FPS with no extra strain on your PC, and unlike Nvidia’s frame generation, it doesn’t need any specialist hardware to work.  Therefore older cards, as well as recent AMD GPUs like the RX 7700 XT and RX 7800 XT, could get a new lease of life in games that support it.\nRead more",

          "description": "During the Nintendo Direct the other week, a single game stood head and shoulders above the rest for me. It wasn't Super Mario Wonder (though that does look pretty all right for a 2D Mario game), and it wasn't F-Zero 99 (which I sort of instantly dismissed as a cheap cash-in on that most excellent of neglected Nintendo racing games but have since been told is also quite good). Rather, it was the news that the insta-sit-up-and-pay-attention pairing of Atlus and Vanillaware were making a new fantasy tactics RPG called - wait for it - Unicorn Overlord, and woah nelly, it looks absolutely incredible. Vanillaware games have always been a feast for the eyes - see Muramasa: The Demon Blade on Wii and more recently 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim on PS4 and Switch - and the thought of marrying those lovely visuals with what appears to be a pixel art mash-up of Final Fantasy Tactics and Fire Emblem? Yes please and thank you. \nI was all ready to gush about it in a news post and whack it straight into our release date calendar when I first saw it. But then my heart sank. The press release for it came through, and despite it launching on literally every other console including the Nintendo Switch, PC was not among them. My heart. It was broken.\nRead more",

Welcome to the fourth chapter of the great Starfield no-planets run, in which my character, rancid astro-buccaneer Mary Read, tries to play the entirety of Bethesda's so-big-it's-small RPG in space. When last we caught up with this galloping galactic nuisance, Mary was beginning to lose momentum. She had grown weary of happy-slapping freighter after freighter, though there's one particular wandering geologist she'd like to settle the score with. She had even lost her enthusiasm for boarding actions - the spice in every pirate's cup of grog - having mastered the art of standing at the bottom of a ladder. \r\n\n\r\nI've spent the past few days trying to cook up a proper endgame objective for Mary - some mad caper befitting a legendary space pirate and her rowdy crew of turncoats and tearaways, who absolutely aren't a bunch of corpses Mary has arranged into sitting postures and decorated with buckets. And in my desperation, I have turned to the forbidden magic of Starfield console commands - a hundred or more deceptively homely lines of text which, when typed into Starfield's in-game console (hit the tilde or @ key), can be used to perform impossible feats, like unlocking all the game's powers or becoming immortal. My initial hope was to solidify the game's weirdly intangible asteroids somehow, and build outposts on them. It's been a couple hours since then, and well, everything has gone awonk. I'm not even playing Starfield anymore. Instead, I am playing a very special, inadvertent Starfield mod of my own devising. Working title: \"Totally Fucked\".\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "As a child of the early internet, games like Hypnospace Outlaw can't help but resonate quite deeply with me. This was the internet as I remembered it, goddamnit, and the fact it mixed in a compelling corporate conspiracy story in between its pages was just the icing on an already fine cake (in GIF form, naturally, with a MIDI tune of Vivaldi's Four Seasons blaring out from your internet browser for good measure). But in revisiting Hypnospace for this month's RPS Game Club, there was one page in particular that really brought the rose-tinted shutters down on me. It was beautiful, lovely April, Hypnospace's virtual pet hamster, who can live, snooze and poop on your desktop, and maybe turn a slightly sickly shade of green if you don't pay enough attention to her.  \nAs with most things in Hypnospace, I can only assume that April and her fellow gaggle of virtual pet friends are riffs on real-life virtual pet games Catz and Dogz from the late 90s, which, yes, as a ten-year-old girl at the time, I was absolutely obsessed with. Developed by the now defunct PF Magic, Catz and Dogz 3 were arguably two of my most formative PC games growing up, and cor, I miss those dumb beasts so very much.\nRead more",

Is this kind of like when Prince of Persia went all edgelord with Warrior Within? Do I need to call Mintrocket's parents and ask for an intervention?\r\n\n\r\nThing is, if you take a step back from each game they're actually very similar. Both are fundamentally about scouring dangerous places for resources and ferrying them back to a safe area where you can sell them off. Both pit you, a mediocre human, against strange and unearthly creatures. Both are sort of about redeeming scenario concepts we all hate - in Dave the Diver's case, the water level, and in Nakwon's case, the stealth mission. See, this is practically a remake!

          "description": "On the latest-but-one revision of their About page, Metacritic describe the process of calculating a videogame's aggregate \"Metascore\" as a kind of \"magic\". The FAQ cheekily invites you to \"peek behind the curtain\", evoking the figure of the theatre conjurer beckoning the audience on-stage to inspect the props, before performing the trick. You're only shown so much, however. There are tables for conversions between different review scoring systems, demonstrating how a B- becomes 67/100, but the \"weighting\" Metacritic gives to each source publication when producing the combined Metascore is a closely-guarded mystery.\nYou could argue that the secrecy is necessary to avoid heavily weighted publications being targeted and pestered by fans to deliver positive reviews of forthcoming games, so as to swing the average (though in practice, Metascore soothsayers have long since sussed out which outlets have the most votes). But I think it's better understood as a mixture of basic trademark protection and a mechanism of enchantment, a means of both deterring imitators and keeping avid readers guessing about the output. After all, no professional magician seriously wants to give away how the trick is performed, much as no meat magnate wants to show you the inside of a sausage factory.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "I've read several comments here and elsewhere that Bethesda's Starfield is \"a mile-wide but deep as a puddle\", or variations on that theme. Said commenters might be tickled to know that there is, in fact, a puddle in the game's Akila City that contains infinite loot: by dint of peering into it, you'll magically gain access to a nearby store's inventory. Strip the shelves, then wait a day or two, and you'll be able to do so again, forever and ever.\nOr at least, that was the case till this week's Starfield patch, a small update consisting of exactly ten bulletpoints, including one that tackles \"an issue that allowed for a vendor's full inventory to be accessible\". Boo! Time to go looking for another convenient in-game metaphor, I guess. Perhaps there's something incredibly clever you can say about all the flying cities.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "About a third of the way through Mineko's Night Market, a young boy dressed as a fish says to his octopus-chopping father, \"What? I just thought sending the local errand kid on missions was how people acquired stuff on this island.\" To many, this will simply be a comic jibe at what you, the aforementioned local errand kid, have been doing for the last eight hours or so. After moving to this rural backwater with your dad in search of a better life, you quickly realise that no one in this town ever gets off their arse to get anything done.\nInstead, it's up to you, Mineko, to fulfil every last one of their desires, whether it's collecting 50 bits of wood so they can construct a frame for their new house (before asking you for 50 bits of paper to give it some flimsy-looking walls), buying and delivering them a sports drink they could have easily got themselves from the local shop, or crafting a flower box for them because, well, they asked you to. As I said, industry isn't exactly their strong suit here, and you'd be forgiven for wondering how any of them functioned as human beings before you arrived.\nBut this line of dialogue also strikes right at the heart of what a joyless experience Mineko's Night Market is. It reveals the cold, lifeless husk beneath its lovely visuals. It's nothing but 'Me, me, me' and 'Take, take, take' in this game, and NPCs offer nothing in return except soul-crushing tedium and a long list of repetitive chores. Animal Crossing this is not, my friends, so don't be fooled. This is about as far from 'cosy' and 'cute' as you can possibly get - and that's despite it having dozens of pet-able cats.\nRead more",

          "description": "Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty is, according to our reviewer Graham, \"perhaps the best expansion pack ever made.\" Feh, small potatoes – Phantom Liberty’s most prestigious achievement is surely how it heralds a new ray tracing feature that makes Cyberpunk 2077 look and run a tiny bit better. On specific settings. And only on GeForce RTX graphics cards. The more expensive ones.\nHello, then, to DLSS 3.5 and its Ray Reconstruction component. Like how DLSS improves visuals and performance with AI-aided upscaling and ant-aliasing, Ray Reconstruction injects some machine learning cleverness into the rendering of ray tracing. Nvidia say Ray Reconstruction cleans up artefacts and reduces the performance impact of RT effects, and judging by how it works in Cyberpunk 2077, I’d say they’re correct – with the caveat that all its enhancements are, ultimately, modest.\nRead more",

          "description": "Dragon's Dogma was the action-RPG for people who wanted to play alone, but didn't want to feel alone. By far its most charming feature was the Pawn system, whereby you'd create an AI-controlled sidekick and hire two others, shared online by other players, to accompany you on your journey through a fantasy wilderness of tumbledown castles and goblin campfires. Pawns make dependable companions in many respects - pinning enemies for you to tag-team kill, healing or resurrecting you, opening chests you've missed, and enchanting your weapons at the outset of each skirmish. But what makes them fun to be around is that they're a bunch of massive buffoons. \r\n\n\r\nPawns talk without cease as you explore: a steady patter of idle observations about well-wrought staircases and the local fish trade, advice about the bestiary and, in the case of Pawns recruited from other players, quest tips based on time in their own worlds - all of it couched in the game's quirky faux-medieval dialect. Pawn dialogue is highly context-sensitive, and very often, nonsensical. They'll climb into fountains and complain that they're wet, and launch into pithy descriptions of monsters even as they're set on fire. It ought to be maddening, but somehow, it never is - probably because the Pawns never actually attempt to be witty like ally characters in, say, Xenoblade Chronicles. They're resolutely straight foils in a realm of lions with snakes for tails, chaotic boulder traps, unpleasantly lusty ogres, and players who push the wrong buttons and make random decisions on the fly. Well, pawns are back in Dragon's Dogma 2, which I recently played an hour of, and they're chattier than ever.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "After the Wii’s release, we went through a period of denial. We were promised that it was motion controls – not the next generation of graphical splendor – that would carry video games into the future. But while Wii Sports was fun, we wanted to see what motion controls could do outside a set of family-friendly minigame compilations. The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess didn’t make very good use of the controls, but it was really a port of a GameCube title. So, we just needed to wait a bit longer, and the vision Nintendo promised us would eventually arrive.\n\n\nSometime before, we just gave up and realized that motion controls just kind of suck in general, Escape from Bug Island hit the shelves.

          "description": "Sergiy Galyonkin has announced via Twitter today that he has resigned from his role as Director of Publishing Strategy at Epic Games. He had been with the company for over eight years.\n\n\nIn his post, Sergiy Galyonkin thanks Epic for the aid they’ve donated in support of Ukraine during Russia’s ongoing invasion. He outlines his role in establishing Epic’s direction (which he refers to as Epic 4.0), but opines that he doesn’t feel he is a fit for their new course (Epic 5.0).\n\n\n“Now, Epic Games is on its way to transforming from a game developer, engine creator, and publisher into a platform - Epic 5.0. I am not a good fit for this new version of Epic; it requires people of a different kind.”\n\n\nIt’s interesting to note that Sergey Galyonkin was the creator of the Steam Spy service in 2015, which tracks sales through the Steam platform. He then used his experience with tracking the platform to help Epic create the Epic Games Store.\n\n\nI’m not going to speculate on the deeper meaning of Galyonkin’s departure, as I don’t want to put words in his mouth. I do have to wonder about the timing of this, as just last week Epic Games cut 16% of its workforce as a way of refocusing. It just feels bad, and I would be shocked if the two things weren’t related.\n\n\nAt the very least, Galyonkin goes on to say, “I plan to remain in the gaming industry. I also hope to be more vocal now that I don’t have to worry about the PR department knocking on my DMs.” Considering the valuable insight he shared before joining Epic, I’m personally looking forward to seeing what he dishes out now.\n\nThe post Epic’s Director of Publishing Strategy, Sergiy Galyonkin, is leaving the company appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Aside from some legendary monsters and surprisingly strong event battles, Pokemon Scarlet & Violet loves pitting players against starter Pokemon from previous generations in Tera Raid battles. And this weekend, it seems like we'll return to that standard with a slight twist. As the next 7-Star Tera Raid event, all Pokemon Scarlet & Violet trainers will face off against Hisuian Decidueye.\n\n\nAccording to the official Pokemon account on Twitter, the Hisuian Decidueye Tera Raid will utilize the Grass Tera Type. By default it's a Grass/Fighting-Type hybrid, though its movepool has a lot of potential coverage. So while several Pokemon fare well against Grass-Types, you may need to wait until we know its attacks to form an optimal counter. Like past 7-Star raids, this one will feature the Mightiest Mark that gives it the \"Unrivaled\" title if you catch it, which is a nice perk for hardcore collectors.\n\n\nThis isn’t the first time we’ve seen Decidueye in a Tera Raid. In fact, the last time we saw this ‘mon in Scarlet & Violet was last March. However, this one is specifically the Hisuian variant from Pokemon Legends: Arceus. \n\n\nThis raid will be available in two date ranges: October 5 at 9:00 a.m. JST / 8:00 p.m. EST to October 9 at 8:59 a.m. JST / 7:59 p.m. EST, and then again on October 12 at 9:00 a.m. JST / 8:00 p.m. EST to October 15 at 8:59 a.m. JST / 7:59 p.m. EST. Whether you challenge Hisuian Decidueye this weekend or next weekend, best of luck!\n\nThe post The next Pokemon Scarlet & Violet 7-Star Tera Raid event features Hisuian Decidueye appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Grand Theft Auto is one of the biggest gaming franchises of all time, so it's no surprise that players have been overly eager to hear more about GTA 6. This has resulted in a few controversies, including an arrest following a massive leak. With very little official word from Rockstar, the thirst for GTA 6 information only strengthens. It appears this has driven some fans to desperate measures to find out more about the game.\n\n\n\n\nTwitter user @GTAVInewz recently posted an image presenting a theory which claims we're going to get more GTA 6 news soon. With over half a million views already, it's caught quite a lot of people's attention despite presenting easily irrefutable claims. \n\n\nImage via Rockstar.\n\n\nDoes the moon predict the date of the next GTA 6 announcement? \n\n\nAccording to the theory, Rockstar usually announces its games on a Tuesday. Right off the bat, the theory can be debunked, as the image claims that Red Dead Redemption 2 was released on a Tuesday. This is false, as October 26, 2018, fell on a Friday. \n\n\n\n\nThe image then claims that most GTA and RDR games are released in October. The final piece in the puzzle is a recent image posted by Rockstar on Twitter. It features a waning gibbous moon behind the Vinewood sign in GTA 5. We will happen to experience a waning gibbous moon on October 3, leading to the conclusion that a GTA 6 announcement is coming on this day. \n\n\nAlthough amusing, this is definitely not a theory to put your money behind. Even without a GTA 6 announcement, October is set to be a massive month for gaming thanks to the release of several massive games, including Assassin's Creed: Mirage, Spider-Man 2, and Alan Wake 2, to name just a few.\n\nThe post The moon is the latest source of alleged GTA 6 leaks appeared first on Destructoid.",

These include new sneakers, weapons, and upgradable powers that make it easier to put the boot to the bizarre enemies on the streets. The Anger Foot trailer shows off a few locations, from sewers to run-down apartments. And yeah, enemies definitely won't find any sort of reprieve in the bathroom.  \n\n\nDespite the extended wait, players have had a chance to check out a demo on Steam. There's still no release date in place, so we'll have to kick it until we find out when it's coming to PC. \n\nThe post Anger Foot gameplay trailer leaves no faces or doors unkicked appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "As part of the Realms Deep event, 3D Realms and Voidpoint have announced that the long-awaited expansion to 2019’s Ion Fury, Aftershock, will be released October 2, 2023. Happy Monday!\n\n\nIon Fury is a modern game built in Duke Nukem 3D’s legendary Build Engine. In a lot of ways, it’s a spiritual successor to Duke 3D. In fact, it would probably have been a Duke Nukem game if 3D Realms hadn’t handed the character over to Gearbox.\n\n\nInstead, you play as Shelly “Bombshell” Harrison. The expansion pack has her once again going up against her nemesis, Dr. Heskel. Beyond simply being a map pack, Aftershock adds new enemies, weapons, and a motorcycle for Shelly. Beyond that, there’s also a new difficulty and an “Arrange Mode” for the base game that lets you experience everything again in a remixed way.\n\n\n\n\nCool beans. I don’t think that Ion Fury is quite as great as Duke Nukem 3D – largely because of a harder-to-manage arsenal and less spectacular level design – but as a spiritual successor, it hit the mark. I mean, I think about it, and I’m like, this could have been Duke Nukem Forever. Instead of the mess we got, they could have given us something like this.\n\n\nHopefully, the Aftershock expansion improves things in some appreciable ways. I’m looking forward to it.  Also, note that this is a different game than Phantom Fury. That one is being done by Slipgate Ironworks and is more of a sequel.\n\n\nIon Fury: Aftershock releases October 2, 2023. Currently, it’s only for PC with no word on other platforms.\n\nThe post Ion Fury’s Aftershock expansion is out on October 2 appeared first on Destructoid.",

This time, it's taking its experience with procedural generation and giving it a first-person twist with a sequel titled Gunhead. Described as an \"FPS Jetpack Roguelike,\" the team's latest is now locked in for November 8 on PC and PlayStation 5. The release date was announced today during the Realms Deep digital event. You can see how it looks in action in the new trailer below.\n\n\n\n\nAs the preview shows, Alientrap is still all about blasting Mother Brains and other cybernetic monstrosities. The follow-up to Cryptark features procedurally generated starships and over 50 weapons and items to add to your loadout. For those who want to give it a shot, a demo is now live on Steam. \n\n\nLet's get ready to cyber-rumble\n\n\nThe setup for Gunhead has players boarding space-hulks and attempting to neutralize them. Doing so will net them more money for their Privateering enterprise. All of the obstacles — from security systems to cyborgs — lead to a battle with the Core. The setup is similar to Cryptark, which had you taking on salvage missions before tackling the massive alien title ship. That one was also procedurally generated, so anyone familiar with Alientrap's previous outing should feel at home here.\n\n\nCryptark was fast and frantic, so it looks like that's what they're going for with the sequel. Gunhead promises multiple enemy ship types, and we'll get to see how varied their challenges are when the full game launches. \n\nThe post Roguelike first-person shooter Gunhead set for November on PC, PS5 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "As part of the Realms Deep stream, 3D Realms and Slipgate Ironworks have announced a release date for the remaster of Kingpin: Life of Crime. Named Kingpin: Reloaded, it’s set to release on December 5, 2023.\n\n\nKingpin: Life of Crime was originally released in 1999 by Interplay. It would prove to be the last game by developer Xatrix Entertainment before much of the staff was transferred to Activision under a studio known as Gray Matter Studios. Xatrix was known for the Redneck Rampage and Cyberia games.\n\n\n\n\nIt would largely be overshadowed by the more forward-thinking Half-Life, but Kingpin brought a few innovations of its own. It had side-quests, the Pawn-O-Matic shop system, and a skill system that has you starting off inexperienced with new weapons before gradually building up accuracy.\n\n\nThe remaster seems to essentially be targeting texture fidelity. The muddy filtered textures have been overhauled to look better at higher definitions. However, the wobble of the 3D objects still exists, which I find interesting. That’s not exactly unwelcome and probably the best we can hope for when it comes to the remaster of such a niche title. I’m just always happy to see a game get upgraded for modern systems.\n\n\nKingpin: Reloaded is chambered for a December 5, 2023 firing date.

Additionally, four mystery bonus characters will join mid-season.\n\n\nDisney Speedstorm just boosted out of the Early Access period and released its 1.0 version. This means that anyone can play the game under its free-to-play model. It's available on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Nintendo Switch, and PC. There's also crossplay and cross-play functionality.\n\n\n\n\nTo help celebrate the launch, Gameloft announced its upcoming roadmap.

          "description": "Cyberpunk 2077 is getting another patch just a couple of weeks after the 2.0 update dropped. Despite receiving a slew of gameplay overhauls and bug fixes, it can still be a glitchy game.\n\n\nCD Projekt Red announced the patch on its website with fixes both platform-specific and across all releases. Most of these aren't large improvements, ranging from adjusting radio songs' volume to properly initiating a glitched gig. One now-fixed bug I experienced is the distorted screen effect not disappearing after the Automatic Love quest.\n\n\nTwo notes are particularly notable as fairly big fixes, though.\n\n\nThe first is a nasty bug that corrupts PS5 saves for exceeding file limits, and the studio's solution is increasing the maximum size for files. Corrupted saves are unfortunately not recoverable, and CDPR recommends you keep a manual save before the corrupted point. \n\n\nMore so on the side of general improvements, performance should see a bump across all platforms, with upgrades to Dogtown, notably. It's technically an improvement throughout Cyberpunk's world, but Dogtown was highlighted as a notable area where issues occurred. \n\n\nThe post implies several smaller fixes are also on the way as CD Projekt Red mentions those noted are just the highlights. Another thing missing from the post is a specific release date for the patch other than it's coming soon.\n\n\nCyberpunk 2077 is a far more stable release than in 2020, but it's great that CD Projekt Red is still regularly rolling out more fixes. It's not a surprise a content drop as big as Phantom Liberty introduced a few more problems the team is working on fixing. Hopefully, Cyberpunk 2077 will stand as a finely polished RPG by the time it's last fixes release.\n\nThe post Cyberpunk 2077 patch will fix bug corrupting PS5 saves, improve performance appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "At long last, AMD's response to Nvidia's ubiquitous DLSS 3.0 frame generation tech has made its debut. Despite the lack of pomp about the long-awaited feature, AMD has pushed FSR3 out into two relatively major games: Forspoken and Immortals of Aveum. The particularly notable bit here is that Forspoken's demo now supports FSR3 as well. This is great news for those who'd like to try frame generation out but aren't keen on buying Forspoken.\n\n\nMore specifically, FSR3 frame generation tech will be available in Forspoken as of update 1.22. For Immortals of Aveum, the feature is live as of version 1.0.5.0, which could have big implications for its performance. Since AMD hadn't previously announced when, exactly, FSR3 would become publicly available for anyone to use, all benchmarks and comparison…",

Eurogamer also reports the news was delivered to employees during an emergency town hall meeting this morning.\nIn addition to members of the QA team, Team17 CEO Michael Pattison will also be stepping down, according to a statement received by VG247. This stands in sharp contrast to many other recent layoffs, where executives had been exempt from cost-cutting measures. You can read the full statement below.\nFor more on the recent wave of layoffs, read about how Sega canceled several upcoming games and how Epic laid off over 800 people.\n[Source: Eurogamer, VG247]\nWhat do you think about this year's massive amount of layoffs?",

Between its visuals, throwback gameplay, nautical tunes, and modern reimaginings of old-school adventure gameplay, it caught my attention. And now it's finally out!\nI spoke to developer Webbysoft, who is mostly just one person based in Australia, about Bilkins' Folly ahead of the game's release over email.

Join us today on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. Central as we take a bloody journey through the game's genre-defining story campaign. Episodes will be uploaded to our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel the following Saturday morning. \nAfter 2006's Mortal Kombat: Armageddon seemingly concluded the franchise's main narrative, 2011's entry picked up the bloody pieces. It moved the saga forward by resetting the timeline, serving as a soft reboot that brought Mortal Kombat back to its 2D fighting roots and ushering in the return of the classic roster. MK 9's cinematic story mode served as an epiphany for the series and fighting games as a whole, establishing the blueprint for narrative fighting campaigns still utilized today. MK9's story also serves as the first chapter of the modern trilogy of games that Mortal Kombat 1 builds upon. For a whole lot more on MK9 and its development, you can read this feature on how the reboot saved the franchise.\nJoin editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they battle their way through MK 9 to see how its reimagined tournament holds up. \nPart 1 - Surpr-iced! \nPart 2 - Bringing The Smoke\nPart 3 - Staff Meeting\nPart 4 - My Life As A Lin Kuei Robot\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

We will continue to consider measures to improve profitability in European bases apart from above. We will announce the specific details and impact from them as soon as we make a decision.\" \nSega says as a result of this structural reform, it expects to record losses of approximately 14.3 billion yen for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, but that \"there are no changes to the full-year consolidated operating results forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, at this time.\" \nSega revealed Hyenas as a first-person multiplayer, multi-team heist shooter experience set in space with a punky comic book aesthetic in 2022.

Today, Netflix released our first look at the series, which is called Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft. \nThere's no word on when to expect the series, but Netflix says it's coming to the subscription streaming service soon. \nCheck out the Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft teaser trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see in the teaser above, this take on Lara Croft seemingly follows the recent Crystal Dynamics Tomb Raider reboot trilogy that concluded with 2018's Shadow of the Tomb Raider.

Platinum thanks Kamiya for his work while stating it looks forward to seeing what he does next, while Kamiya notes that the decision to leave was not an easy one but he feels it's for the best. \nHere's Platinum's statement: \npic.twitter.com/GHiSugPF42\nSeptember 25, 2023\nAnd here's what Kamiya tweeted today about his upcoming departure: \nHowever, I feel this outcome is for the best.\nSeptember 25, 2023\nBefore co-founding Platinum in February of 2006, Kamiya worked on Capcom's Resident Evil series, helping plan the first game and directing its sequel, as well as its Devil May Cry series. He also directed the first Viewtiful Joe game, and then Okami in 2006 at Capcom's Clover Studio. Capcom closed Clover later that year but Platinum had already been somewhat founded under the name Seeds, Inc. It was later renamed Platinum Games and the rest was history. \nKamiya departs from Platinum more than 17 years after he founded it alongside Shinji Mikami, who is no longer there and departed from Tango Gameworks earlier this year, and Atsushi Inaba, who is the studio's CEO.\nWhile waiting to learn what Kamiya is up to next, read Game Informer's review of Bayonetta and then check out our thoughts on The Wonderful 101.

One month later, the CMA has granted preliminary approval to Microsoft due to its new Ubisoft deal. \nThe CMA says it has \"identified limited residual concerns with the new deal\" but that Microsoft has put forward remedies (see: Ubisoft's role) that the CMA \"has provisionally concluded should address these issues.\" The CMA is now consulting on those remedies before making a final official decision ahead of the October 18 deadline to do so. \n\n\n\"…",

The game is coming to Microsoft’s consoles and Windows PC early next year.\nThe RPG was first released to PlayStation consoles, Switch, and PC in February. Octopath Traveler II, like its predecessor, sees players guide eight adventurers across a sprawling adventure in an HD-2D rendered world. Though similar on the surface, the sequel has been praised for its improvements in storytelling, character development, progression, and navigation. \nIn our review, we scored Octopath Traveler II an 8.5 out of 10, with guest writer Josh Broadwell writing that “Octopath Traveler II does what an excellent sequel should. Instead of breaking new ground left and right, it improves on the original in nearly every way and feels more confident about the stories it tells.”",

This release date was revealed in a new gameplay trailer from IGN for Assassin's Creed Nexus VR, which gives us another look at the game's three protagonist assassins: Ezio from Assassin's Creed II, Connor from Assassin's Creed III, and Kassandra from Assassin's Creed Odyssey. \nIn the trailer, we get a look at how combat and parkour will work in the game. As expected, given the game is a VR exclusive title, everything happens from a first-person perspective. As Connor, players will explore 18th Century America during the American Revolution. As Ezio, players will parkour through 15th Century Italy during the Italian Renaissance, and as Kassandra, players will fight as a mercenary assassin through ancient Greece. \nCheck out the Assassin's Creed Nexus VR gameplay trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Assassin's Creed Nexus VR looks pretty much exactly as you'd expect for an Assassin's Creed game in VR. All the assassin tropes are still there, fortunately, like leaps of faith, hidden blades, parkour, and more. \nAssassin's Creed Nexus VR hits Meta Quest devices on November 16. \nWhile waiting for its release, check out this Assassin's Creed Nexus VR trailer from June and then read our preview after checking out more of the game earlier this summer. \nAre you going to check out Assassin's Creed Nexus VR in November?

The updated gameplay features a jetpack that allows you to leave the ground, providing a new and fresh perspective that emphasizes the excitement and challenges of exploring Tricuspid, the second alien moon of planet Evath.\nThis time, the vicious Ketars have scattered and hidden Energy Collection Devices (ECD) around their base to destroy your home planet. It’s up to you to destroy them first! The tricky part is many ECDs are connected to each other and can regenerate instantly, so you must figure out the right order to successfully complete your mission. \nOur reimplementation of the Freescape engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Dark Side support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC. Additionally, there are two playable demos if you want to test the game. Support for Amiga and AtariST will be available later! Please contact us if you have some other release.\nTo play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build.

Since Lars Sundström, aka lman, joined our team as the iOS porter, we have made significant progress. Thus, you no longer need to compile ScummVM yourself in order to add it to your iOS or iPadOS device. \nIf you want to help by testing this version, just follow this Testflight link and enroll yourself in the test program. This may require installing Apple’s Testflight app. You can find instructions on how to install games and how to play them on our documentation portal.\nWe truly appreciate your feedback. You can share your thoughts with the Testflight feedback feature, where you can attach screenshots and post detailed descriptions. Alternatively, you can use our bugtracker, e-mail us at ios@scummvm.org, or post on our Discord Server. Your help will let us eventually add ScummVM to the App Store.\n>",
