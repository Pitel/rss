Not by the government, but by the only force in King City that matters – The Company. Capes takes the turn-based strategy genre and gives it a comic book feel, putting you in the control of a fledgling group of superheroes trying to dish out justice in a city where justice doesn’t exist. While some of its visuals lack a bit of polish, the actual gameplay in Capes is heroic enough to make up for it.\nIf you throw The Boys and Watchmen into a blender with XCOM 2, what you’d be left with would be Capes. Developer Spitfire Interactive knew exactly the tone it was going for and stuck with it. You start with two superheroes and a grizzled veteran calling the shots from a bunker and slowly assemble a team capable of freeing King City from the grip of The Company, which is so evil it doesn’t need a proper name.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

As such, he struck a deal with Nintendo in which 20-30% of his surplus income would go to the company, meaning that he will likely be in significant debt for many years to come.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

You might run into an easy enemy once in a while, but if you decide to take a chance during an expedition and descend a floor ‘just to see’ how it goes, it will not go well. \"Your entire party has been slaughtered.\" Again. This remake of Sir-Tech's formative 1981 dungeon crawler may have had a few rough edges sanded off by Digital Eclipse, but underneath the finery this is the same game that has been wiping your parties for over four decades. There's no such thing as 'winging it' in Wizardry.\nThe remake opens with a letter from the 'Project Murphy' team explaining its aims. \"Our primary goal is to make the original game accessible to modern players while remaining faithful to the original feel and gameplay.\" For better or worse, what we have here is a very faithful adaptation that retains the spirit of the Apple II original.

It’s so focused on looking pretty that it hasn’t even noticed the title and subtitle got mixed up.\nSure enough, Hellblade 2 is a harsh test for older hardware, with a heavy reliance on DLSS or FSR upscaling to keep performance sweet. That said, it’s no Dragons Dogma 2-style technical horrorshow either. A happy balance of visuals and smoothness is attainable on plush PCs and low-end laptops alike, while DLSS 3 frame generation can deliver an effective kick in the framerate pants on RTX 40 series GPUs.\nRead more",

This is just one of many laughs your diaphragm will endure as you navigate \"the escalating adventures of a girl trying to make zines in a town of giallo-style masked serial murderers\". The horror comedy already won its creators the Nuovo Award at the Independent Games Festival this year, recognition that has been a long time coming for prolific game maker Stephen \"thecatamites\" Gillmurphy. If you're unfamiliar with his work, you can get acquainted next week, when Anthology of the Killer gets its full release on Itch.io on May 28th.  At which point you can explore its unsettling urban hell of shady corporations and cops who think they're cool. There's a trailer below.\nRead more",

Soon you bump into a ghostly girl, who guides you to a tower that thrusts you both up to a higher plane - but though she ascends, you're dragged back to the bottom at the last moment by some netherworldly chains.

I mean it as a distinction between those games that let you plop down a house, and others that need you to stack the bricks, install the plumbing, fit the lights, and select the wallpaper. The first Prison Architect allowed you to finesse every detail of a secure correctional facility, down to each cell and dog kennel. Unsurprisingly for a sim about prison, it encouraged obsessive control. The 3D-ified sequel isn't finished yet, but it's taking a similar approach. Maybe a little too similar.\nRead more",

Lorelei, despite its single-solution puzzles, is not dictatorial. It’s far too interested in collaborating with you for that. It wants you to observe, consider, and interpret its many mysteries. What’s really hooked me here is how those puzzles are kept coherent and logical, despite you getting delivered a letter by dog and occasionally visiting a floppy disk bizzaro world where you converse with a magician who manifests from his own discarded hat.\nRead more",

          "description": "I've clocked up nearly 400 hours playing BioWare's big fantasy RPG Dragon Age: Inquisition, which is not a stat I'm particularly proud of. I'm not ashamed either, partly because, as has been identified by artist Corey Brickley, via the Maw, there's a lot of filler. Brickley has collated a list of suggested mods to slim down Dragon Age: Inquisition from a potentially 80 hours-long epic to a trim 40 hour story-focused romp, which means you might be able to play through it again in time for the launch of Dragon Age: Dreadwolf - which is a direct sequel to Inquisition.\nI find this list of mods interesting! It's a way to change the game quite substantially without exactly transforming it, and it's very in-keeping with my campaign to make games 60% smaller. Still, there's at least one item on there I'd push back on, but also this isn't really a new problem for Dragon Age as a series.\nRead more",

Qualified hoorays for that, as well as for the fact that it doesn’t make especially mad demands of your hardware: besides netting a Steam Deck Playable badge from Valve, its minimum PC specs only list the likes of the Intel Core i5-6600 and Nvidia’s GTX 1060. Easily doable, for most aspiring galactic admirals.\nOnce a battle gets underway, however, Homeworld 3’s performance can start tanking, turning an initially smooth engagement into a more stutter-prone light show. The good news? You can more than double your framerates with a relatively small handful of graphics setting changes, even if some these (including the DLSS and FSR 2 upscalers) can be a tad inconsistent in their own right.\nRead more",

I’ll go with ‘caffeinated’ I think. Like the Adult Swim cartoons it reminded me of, it’s got a sense of the sardonic and a penchant for violence, but still comes from a place of having recently devoured several bowls of suspiciously colorful cereal. Anyways, forget all that. I mentioned an FPS in the title, so I must assume you’re here for the violence.\n \nRead more",

He's a vampire doing therapy for other vampires, while also undergoing therapy, as a vampire, from another therapist (who is a vampire). Vampire Therapist! I've been able to get to grips with a playable preview - I'd say I got my teeth into it, but I'm not that much of a hack fraud - which means I got to see some of the things that creative director Cyrus Nemati told me about in our interview in action. I remain optimistic that, on it's release on June 18th, Vampire Therapist can walk the tricky line it's drawn for itself.  \r\n\nIt's balancing on a knife point of humour, the supernatural, and sincerity about mental health, the latter using real cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT; the comments the first time I wrote about Vampire Therapist revealed a lot about our readership) concepts in consultation with licensed therapists. The preview only covered Sam's first meeting with his mentor, Andromachos, and the first client Sam treats himself - a doctor called Drayne, simultaneously self-loathing and self-aggrandising - but it gave a flavour of how the game plays. Rather than a sort of janky template on how to self-therapise, as I'd feared, when you're playing Vampire Therapist it operates more as a sort of language puzzle against different types of theatre kids.\nRead more",

And what's this, developers Hinterland are introducing a new predator, the Cougar, which will move into any area you're fond of and compete over territory. Finally, a bit of friction for what has previously been a stroll in the woods.\r\n\n\r\nIt's not all misery. In a first for The Long Dark, which has hitherto been a permadeath game that wipes your save between runs, the devs are working on an optional Cheat Death system. It's not as cheaty as it sounds, however. You can only return from the grave four times, and each time, you'll have to make unspecified trade-offs. The idea is to stop people backing up their saves and make failure more of an adventure or if you prefer, an agonisingly slow decline, rather than letting players avoid the consequences of their actions.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Greek god pulverizing simulator Hades 2 is getting its first patch \"later this month\", say the developers. Two things are on their to-tweak list. First, something might change about the way resource gathering tools are used (the pickaxe you use to mine silver during a run, for example). Second, and perhaps more significant, is an upcoming change to the way Melinoë's dash and sprint work. We don't know exactly what that change is but, according to Supergiant, it has something to do with your witchy batterer's \"distinct style\". \nRead more",

          "description": "A while back Ubisoft revealed about a billion Assassin's Creed projects. The first of these to leap into the carefully placed haystack of release was Mirage, which I liked. Up next, it seems, is the artist formally known as Assassin's Creed: Codename Red. All we knew about red was that it would be set in feudal Japan, something fans have been clamouring for for literal years. Now we know that it's an AC game set in feudal Japan called Assassin's Creed Shadows, and it's getting an \"official cinematic world premiere trailer\" debut on YouTube tomorrow, at 5pm BST.\nAlso, because this sort of thing seems to always happen with Ubi, the placeholder text for said YouTube premiere might have accidentally leaked the release date for the game as November 15, 2024.\nRead more",

Since the Ryzen 5000 series we have seen the likes of ASRock Rack and Supermicro putting out interesting budget-friendly Ryzen servers and that has ramped up even more with AMD Ryzen 7000 series server performance being stellar thanks to AVX-512 and other improvements making it more practical for such workloads. AMD has now solidified its positioning for entry-level servers with the introduction of the EPYC 4004 series processors. The EPYC 4004 series is derived from the Ryzen 7000 series offerings to facilitate cost conscious server options and putting the Intel Xeon E-2400 series in the crosshairs. In this review is a look at the EPYC 4004 series along with benchmarks of nearly the entire EPYC 4004 product stack compared to Intel's current top-end Xeon E-2400 series processor, the Intel Xeon E-2488 Raptor Lake.",

While we weren't expecting the arrival of Magneto to Fortnite, we already knew that a Fallout event was on the way, and now we know that Power Armor is something we can acquire. \n\n\nIf you love the games or enjoyed the Amazon Prime series, then here's how you can get the T-60 Power Armor in Fortnite. \n\n\nHow to unlock Fallout's Power Armor in Fortnite\n\n\nTo unlock Fallout's Power Armor, you'll need to purchase the Season 3 Battle Pass. That's because the Power Armor isn't a vehicle in-game, but rather a skin you can wear all the time. \n\n\nTo unlock the Power Armor we all know and leave, reach Level 54 in the Battle Pass. \n\n\nJoin the Brotherhood of Steel. Image via Epic Games\n\n\nThat's not all though, as there is a special edition of the T-60 Power Armor named \"Hot Rod\" that has red paint and black flames on it. It's very cool, and can be unlocked at Level 62. \n\n\nCool. Image via Epic Games\n\n\nThere are plenty of other Fallout cosmetics to unlock in the Battle Pass too, including a Pip-Boy back bling, and a Vault Boy emblem.\n\nThe post How to get Fallout’s T-60 Power Armor in Fortnite appeared first on Destructoid.",

With that in mind, the Season 3 Battle Pass skins are all themed to fit the dark and gritty theme, and Magneto is getting that treatment too. \n\n\nIf you fancy getting your hands on this special edition of one of X-Men's most iconic characters, then we've got you covered. \n\n\nOne of X-Men's most iconic characters. Image via Epic Games\n\n\nHow to unlock Wasteland Magneto in Fortnite\n\n\nFortnite players will be able to unlock Wasteland Magneto by completing Battle Pass Quests in July. \n\n\nUnfortunately, we don't have too many details beyond that, as Epic hasn't given us an exact release date, or any clues regarding what those challenges will entail. This means that even if you reach the max level in the Season 3 Battle Pass, you'll still not unlock the skin automatically. \n\n\nIt does make sense that Magneto would arrive in July though, with Deadpool & Wolverine releasing in cinemas on July 26. We've also seen leakers suggest that an Item Shop tab that revolves around the ultra-popular Disney+ cartoon X-Men '97 is coming, so I would expect both to drop simultaneously. \n\n\nAs for what havoc Magneto will cause on the Fortnite island? Well, that remains to be seen. I don't expect he'll just quietly arrive though, so keep an eye out through the summer for some magnetic mischief coming our way. \n\nThe post How to get Fortnite’s Wastelander Magneto skin appeared first on Destructoid.",

Take a look at everything you can unlock in Fortnite Season 3. \n\n\nAs always, Epic Games has been hard at work putting together the Battle Pass, which this season sees Fortnite turn into a Mad Max-esque wasteland, with crazy vehicles that can be modified into true killing machines. \n\n\nMany of these season's skins definitely wouldn't look out of place on Fury Road, and of course, there's the T-60 Power Armor from Fallout in there too to help you survive on the new island. You can look at the full Battle Pass, with every Tier included, below. \n\n\nFortnite Season 3 Battle Pass: All Tiers and cosmetics\n\n\n\nPage one. Image via Epic Games\n\n\nPage two.

Just play matches and grind Quests to earn XP, and you'll be able to get your hands on it. \n\n\nIt's also cool to see classic Fortnite skins get a Wastelands-themed update for this season, with Rust and Brite Bomber both getting gritty new looks to match the desolation of the new island. \n\nThe post All Fortnite: Wrecked Season 3 Battle Pass cosmetics appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "After selecting play in XDefiant, there should be the option to either player Unranked, Ranked, or the Practice Zone. However, Practice Zone is mysteriously unavailable at launch, and XDefiant executive producer Mark Rubin shed some light on when the game mode will be available. \n\n\nBefore jumping right into a match in XDefiant, players could start in the Practice Zone and learn the controls in an obstacle course of test weapons in a firing range. The firing range was an especially useful tool, as it allowed players to test out different attachments, and the firing range dummies had exact damage values from different ranges. This made it easy to tell which weapons did more damage than others and provided a testing ground for users to get more comfortable with their loadouts. \n\n\nAfter being available during the public test sessions, players assumed the Practice Zone would be available at launch. However, the game mode is currently unavailable and was listed in the year one roadmap blog as a feature to be added later. Fortunately, Rubin stepped in and reassured players before frustrations boiled over.\n\n\nWhen is Practice Zone coming to XDefiant ?\n\n\nImage via Ubisoft\n\n\nXDefiant YouTuber NerosCinema claimed, \"It's a bit odd that the XDefiant Practice Zone still isn't available. It was in previous play tests and was fantastic for testing everything in the game out.\" \n\n\nRubin responded, \"It's coming with the first patch or soon (hour or so) after the patch goes live to be specific. Next question, when is the first patch? Glad you asked, but I can't tell you yet but it should be before the weekend if all goes well.\" \n\n\nThe XDefiant dev wouldn't provide a specific date, but players should keep an eye on the official Twitter account for any information on the title's first update. \n\nThe post XDefiant devs provides update on practice zone game mode appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Less than 24 hours after Wuthering Waves officially launched, developer Kuro Game Studio has announced an upcoming patch to fix some of the technical issues currently plaguing players as well as a compensation reward of 10 Lustrous Tides.\n\n\n\n\nThe Waves are a Wuthering\n\n\nIt's been a somewhat rocky start for Wuthering Waves, with players suffering from all sorts of tedious issues including problems downloading and installing, crashes in-game, and even some players who have still not been able to get in and play. Hopefully, these upcoming solutions will fix some of those problems.\n\n\nAs for the compensation...honestly, a free 10 Lustrous Tides is no paltry gift. It amounts to a full 10-pull on the current Beginner's Choice Convene banner which after 80 pulls gives you a guaranteed Resonator of your choice. You can also use it on the standard default Character Permanent Convene banner that has no added bonuses. Has Genshin Impact ever done this? Recently?\n\n\n Monetarily it would require 1,600 Astrite—which would require 1,600 Lunite to convert because you know, gacha—that would set you back $29.99 to acquire through the Store. While you can't directly buy 1,600 Lunite, you can buy 1,980 for $29.99 which would be the cheapest way to get it.\n\n\nIronically, in the time it took for me to type this up, you may have already received your free 10 Lustrous Tides. If you don't see it in your mailbox, try logging out and back in. According to the tweet, the gift should have been sent out to all players who have achieved Union Level 2 or above at 6 pm EST on May 23, 2024. If you haven't started Wuthering Waves yet, you have until July 2, 2024 at 4 pm EST to reach Union Level 2 and receive the reward.\n\n\nOh in case you're wondering, I got nothing good with my 10 Lustrous Tides.\n\nThe post PSA: 10 free Lustrous Tides are coming your way in Wuthering Waves appeared first on Destructoid.",

It also complements stealthy playstyles in missions like Spy where it’s all about dealing with these terminals.\n\n\nHow to unlock Perspicacity in Warframe\n\n\nTo get Perspicacity in Warframe, you need to have the Helminth System unlocked and unlock the third Metamorphosis with it. \n\n\nThis includes having the Helminth Segment installed in your Liset. It’s unlocked by reaching Rank 3 with the Entrati Syndicate and purchasing the blueprint from Son for 15,000 Standing. \n\n\nThese are the materials needed to install the segment:\n\n\n\n50,000 Credits\n\n\n20 Adramal Alloy\n\n\n15 Ganglion\n\n\n5 Purple Velocipod Tags\n\n\n5 Saturated Muscle Mass\n\n\n\nIf you want to skip all the grinding, especially for getting the animal tags for Brother, you can outright purchase this whole thing from the market for 300 Platinum. Skip the crafting times and progress through the Entrati Syndicate stuff.\n\n\nOnce the segment is installed and you can start subsuming Warframes, you have to reach the 3rd Metamorphosis. \n\n\nTo progress with the Helminth system, you have to feed it materials, Subsumes frames, and transfer abilities to other frames. This will contribute towards the meter and get you there. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nHow Perspicacity works in Warframe\n\n\nTo use Perspicacity, you just have to replace a Warframe’s ability, and you’re good to go. In actual use in a mission, you cast it whenever you can before hacking a terminal. The charge stays permanent until you hack a terminal. However, this can go away if you fall out of bounds, get disrupted by a nullifying enemy ability, or get downed.\n\n\nPerspicacity is extremely useful in Sorties, Archon Hunts, and other areas where using Ciphers is disabled.

All weapons have different time-to-kill figures and can also vary based on missed shots and which part of the body you hit. Hitting headshots does extra damage, but players won't hit every headshot perfectly, leading to skewed numbers. Those speeds are further skewed in XDefiant, because the Echelon faction in gives users 125 health points instead of 100 and the Cleaners faction has a passive ability that makes weapons do more damage. \n\n\nOur list ignores the faction abilities and applies a combination of …",

          "description": "With the release of Final Fantasy XIV Dawntrail just around the corner, the social media team for FFXIV (lovingly known as Tweetingway within the community) has asked players to submit their Pictomancer-themed artwork. There are some truly glorious entries, but also a worrying amount of paint-eating. \n\n\nThankfully, the days of Radion paint are long behind us and unlikely to make a re-appearance as part of the Pictomancer's basic rotation. Still, surely Eorzean paint is not the best for your digestion. \n\n\n\n\nPlayers have been submitting their artwork in their droves using the hashtag #PaintYourPicto, and while their skill is inarguable, there is something of a worrying trend running through a lot of the artwork shared — eating the paint. \n\n\n\n\nNow, as a miniature painter, I can confirm that sometimes, just sometimes, paint gets consumed entirely by accident. Dipping your brush into your drink that you’ve stupidly put a little too close to your paint water, accidentally drinking said paint water by mistake, or even licking your brush to sharpen the point before rinsing it off entirely are all ways by which I have consumed paint. \n\n\nThis was pointed out in the comments, with people reiterating the brush-licking point and others who went as far as to say that Nuln Oil is ‘too yummy’ (which I cannot get behind because Nuln Oil is precious and far too easily spilled).\n\n\nOthers asked some highly appropriate questions such as “is the paint safe to eat if it’s made out of Aether?” and when Square Enix is planning to drop the “/eatpaint” emote. Also, I can’t finish this without noting my favorite submission using the #PaintYourPicto so far:\n\n\n\n\nI think the majority of us can relate.\n\nThe post Future Pictomancers show off their art skills, Final Fantasy XIV asks they stop eating the paint appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "You'll naturally take damage as you fight various enemies in Wuthering Waves, especially if a monster has hard-hitting or quick movements. Fortunately, you can restore your health after a difficult fight in numerous ways, ranging from some quick consumables to fast traveling.\n\n\nHow to heal your party in Wuthering Waves\n\n\nThe easiest way to heal your characters early on in Wuthering Waves is to visit a Resonance Nexus. You'll first encounter a Resonance Nexus in Jinzhou during the main story questline. Upon teleporting to the Resonance Nexus, your party members will heal to full health instantly without using any consumables or currencies. \n\n\nIf your characters are already downed, you can also use medicine such as the revival inhaler or nutrient block to restore their HP. However, these items have some limitations, such as only working on downed Resonators or having a limited supply. They work well in a pinch, though.\n\n\nAnother way to heal your characters without consumables is to use Echoes with healing abilities. Some you can find early on include Fission Junrock and Hoartoise, but any with HP recovery skills will work. Once you find an Echo with healing abilities, equip it onto any character and activate its Echo Skill to restore your health.\n\n\nLastly, you can acquire a Resonator with healing abilities. Your best option is Verina, a five-star Resonator who heals and shields your team, making her one of the most powerful characters in the game. However, since she is a five-star character, you'll have to rely on some luck during your Convene pulls and pity opportunities.\n\nThe post Wuthering Waves: How to heal appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, adding friends isn't as easy as adding their character's display name, as you need a specific ID before initiating the request. \n\n\nHow to add friends in Wuthering Waves\n\n\nBelow are the exact steps to use for adding friends in Wuthering Waves:\n\n\n\nOpen your in-game menu and select Friends.\n\n\nSelect Add Friend and type in their user ID.\n\n\nWait for them to accept your request.\n\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nOnce your friend finds their unique ID and shows it to you, you can add them as a friend, allowing them to join your world and adventure alongside you.

          "description": "You knew that red Skull Gem of Flavio’s was going to come in handy at some point in Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door, and here it is. During Chapter 5, you find a skull-shaped door and it seems like the skull-shaped gem might have something to do with unlocking it. Convince Flavio to hand it over, and you’ll meet with the ‘Stache Brothers Red and Blue.\n\n\nTo reiterate, this all happens in Chapter 5. About halfway through the chapter, you’ll find the skull door. Eventually, you’ll return to Flavio who will follow you back across the island to see it for himself. You can then convince him to borrow the skull. It slots into the door, and the ‘Stache Brothers Red and Blue rise from the ground.\n\n\nThe hint for completing this is in Flavio’s song, which he will helpfully start singing soon after the ‘Stache Brothers’ appearance.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThe song first mentions Red ‘Stache “landing on his end” three times. What this means is that you need to jump on top of the pillar with the red mustache and do a spin jump (ground pound) three times.\n\n\nYou’ll then need to move to Blue ‘Stache. The song says he’s whacked four times on the belly. That simply tells you to hit it in the face three times with your hammer.\n\n\nThe skull door will then (partially) open. Grab Admiral Bobbery and toss him up on the ledge that opened. He’ll walk in and detonate, blowing the door open.\n\n\nFlavio will mourn the loss of his treasured Skull Gem, but it is quickly returned to him.\n\nThe post How to solve the ‘Stache Brothers Red and Blue puzzle in Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door appeared first on Destructoid.",

You'll visit this city during the main storyline, but if you've ventured past it, you can fast-travel to the Resonance Nexus and visit the quest marker. \n\n\nAfter speaking to Chenpi, you'll give him the Sonance Casket, where he'll explain the item is and its purpose. Doing this introduces the Casket Delivery service, which, in exchange for Sonance Caskets, you'll receive items such as Astrite, Lustrous Tide, and EXP potions, among other valuables.

Forges of Corruption will feature new enemies, weapons, and environments, and it’s coming June 18, 2024 to PC and Consoles.\n\n\nWarhammer 40K: Boltgun was pretty far off from being my favorite game of 2023. In particular, my biggest issue with it was its confusing and weak level design. However, it still left a big impact on me. Its weapon sound effects are incredible and being a big, stompy-legged war machine felt great. Despite all its problems, I still felt the need to recommend it.\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, I’m definitely interested in this DLC. Beyond giving the developers a chance at highlighting the gameplay with some (hopefully) better level design, I’m excited to see whatever new weapons get thrown our way. To be specific, they’re adding the Multi-Melta and Missile Launcher. Boltgun didn’t have a missile launcher already? I can’t remember. I suppose the eponymous Boltgun is technically a rocket launcher already, as explained to me by a reader.\n\n\nThe Forges of Corruption campaign will take us back to Graia, which is a bit of a shame since I’d rather see something that isn’t just one big industrial planet. The new enemies you’ll be facing are the Helbrute and the Terminator.\n\n\nOn top of but separate from the upcoming DLC, Auroch Digital is also adding a horde mode. A staple of the modern FPS, horde mode has you facing off against endless waves of enemies.

          "description": "Hellblade 2 is almost entirely a linear experience. Barring some slight changes in how you tackle combat or how quickly you solve puzzles, each player gets from point A to point B in the same way.  That is, except for one specific moment near the end of the game. Here's whether you should help Fargrimr or Astridr in Hellblade 2.\n\n\nShould you go with Fargrimr or Astridr in Hellblade 2?\n\n\nThis choice appears when proceeding through the Jarnvior forest near the end of Hellblade 2. As you progress, you'll link back up with your companions who are experiencing their deepest fears come to life. Senua partially helps both Fargrimr and Astridr with their issues, but then comes upon a crossroads where she must choose who to help. The one who's lost his way, or the one who fears what can't die by the blade.\n\n\nWhile this may seem like a big choice, who you choose here doesn't affect the main story in any meaningful way. You'll help one of them navigate the forest for a few moments before finding the other down the path, shaken up but no worse for wear. After meeting up with Thorgestr, the story proceeds as if the choice never came up.\n\n\nWhile it is a little sad that neither choice matters, it's likely Ninja Theory just wanted to test your thoughts on who you'd help in that situation more than making you decide who lives or dies. If you had to choose between someone who could no longer fight for themselves and someone who could no longer see the path forward, who would you choose to save?\n\nThe post Should you help Fargrimr or Astridr in Hellblade 2? appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Earlier this year, Game Informer revealed the exclusive first details and screenshots of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed, the video game set after the events of 2023 film, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem. Following that March reveal, developer A Heartful of Games and publisher Outright Games has largely gone quiet. Today, the publisher revealed what players can expect from the Deluxe and Collector's Editions of Mutants Unleashed if they want to splurge on the game when it arrives later this year.\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed allows you to take control of the four turtles in a 3D brawler/platformer for up to two players. The premium editions of the game will provide additional physical goodies for fans of the franchise. The Deluxe Edition includes the game, an exclusive steelbook, four pin badges, four keychains, and an artbook. Meanwhile, the Collector's Edition includes the game, Season Pass, pizza van statue, LED sign, five pin badges, four patches, a mouse mat, notebook, pen, artbook, poster, stickers, and a collector's box. The Deluxe Edition retails for $60, while the Collector's Edition will set you back $200.\nOddly enough, both the Deluxe and Collector's Editions are exclusive to the PlayStation 5 and Switch versions of the game. If you're not planning to experience this title on those systems, but still want to at least play through the game, you're in luck, as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleahsed arrives on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC later this year.\nFor more on Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in video games, be sure to read our in-depth feature on the history of the video game franchise here, and if you want something else to look forward to, read a comment from TMNT co-creator Kevin Eastman on the upcoming video game based on The Last Ronin here.",

          "description": "Acquisitions have been rampant in the games industry recently. While the prime example on everyone's mind is likely Xbox's recent acquisition of Activision Blizzard, several have already occurred in 2024. The latest was announced today by Atari, which confirmed it is acquiring its longtime rival, Intellivision.\nAtari announced it has purchased the Intellivision brand and more than 200 games from Intellvision Entertainment. As part of the deal, Intellivision Entertainment will rebrand and continue developing and distributing the Amico game console with a license from Atari to distribute new versions of Intellivision games on the console. Atari will also look to expand digital and physical distribution of legacy Intellivision games, potentially create new games, and explore licensing opportunities. \n\"This was a very rare opportunity to unite former competitors and bring together fans of Atari, Intellivision, and the golden age of gaming,\" chairman and CEO of Atari Wade Rosen said in a press release. \n\"Atari has been a valuable partner and we have every confidence they will be a responsible steward of the storied Intellvision brand,\" CEO of Intellivision Entertainment Phil Adam said. \"We look forward to our expanded collaboration and bringing a broad array of new Atari and Intellivision titles to the Amico and Amico Home family gaming platforms.\"\nAtari has been experiencing a bit of a re-emergence in the public consciousness lately. In addition to other acquisitions, such as Nightdive Studios and Digital Eclipse, Atari has also published well-received games like Mr. Run and Jump and Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration. For more on Atari's outlook and current strategy, be sure to listen to a 2023 episode of All Things Nintendo, which featured an in-depth conversation with Wade Rosen right here.",

Druckmann is expectedly vague about Naughty Dog's next big project but offers an enticing tease, saying, \"I'm eager to see how this new game resonates, especially following the success of The Last of Us, as it could redefine mainstream perceptions of gaming.\"\nThe interview, however, primarily focuses on technology and how it improves and makes it easier for creators to tell unique stories. Regarding AI, Druckmann says, \"AI is really going to revolutionize how content is being created, although it does bring up some ethical issues we need to address. With technologies like AI and the ability to do motion capture right from home, we're reducing both costs and technical hurdles, opening the door for us to take on more adventurous projects and push the boundaries of storytelling in games.\"\nHe also briefly touches on the future of The Last of Us TV show, citing that modern technology has allowed him to oversee the TV show's second season remotely from Los Angeles while it shoots in Canada.\nYou can read the full interview here.

Immediately following the presentation, there will be a second livestream to highlight an upcoming game in a \"beloved\" series. Today, the subject of that showcase has been revealed, and surprising no one, it's a new Call of Duty game.\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 6 is a title that might confuse some, seeing as there technically isn't a game titled Black Ops 5. This is because the fifth entry of the sub-series, which launched in 2021, was Black Ops Cold War, temporarily removing the numbered naming convention. The news was announced on social media, but was accompanied by a teaser on YouTube that seems to hint at the events of the game's campaign.\n\n\nThe 40-second clip follows a group of people sneaking onto the top of Mount Rushmore, where they place blindfolds over the eyes of the presidents carved into the mountainside. The first three blindfolds read, \"The truth lies,\" while the fourth features a three-headed wolf logo that was used in the initial redacted teaser of the game.\nThe game will be revealed in full during a presentation on Saturday, June 9, immediately following the Xbox showcase that will start at 10 AM PT/ 1 PM ET. Microsoft is reportedly debating on whether or not the launch the game on Game Pass.\nWhat are you hoping to see from the newest Call of Duty? Let us know in the comments!",

Today, Netflix released the first teaser trailer for Season 4 giving fans their first look at Hemsworth in the role.\n\n\nUnfortunately, Hemsworth doesn’t speak in the brief clip, so we still don’t know how his Geralt voice compares to Cavill’s (or the games, for that matter). But he definitely doesn’t look out of place as the White Wolf and, hopefully, won’t be too much of a distraction in this new season.\nSeason 4 is currently in production in the UK and will be filmed back-to-back with Season 5, which will also be the show's finale. It has no release date but is speculated to premiere in 2025. These last two seasons will cover the three remaining Witcher books: Baptism of Fire, The Tower of the Swallow, and Lady of the Lake. The returning cast includes Anya Chalotra (Yennifer) and Freya Allan (Ciri). \nFor more on The Witcher games, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt got its official PC mod tools this week.

          "description": "Crytek has announced the release date for Hunt: Showdown’s new-gen update, which will also conclude support for the current console versions. This update was first announced last September and will essentially force last-gen players to migrate to current consoles to continue playing the popular shooter. \nIn a developer update, general manager David Fifield announced that the CryEngine 5.11 Update will go live on August 15. This update is treated as a “significant relaunch” that brings native PS5/Xbox Series X/S support along with a host of technical improvements. However, it also means the PS4 and Xbox One versions will become unplayable.\nThat means these players must upgrade to current hardware to continue playing their copies of the game. Crytek assures these players that if they decide to upgrade, player accounts, entitlements, and all owned DLC will transfer to the new-gen version for no extra cost. \n\n\nIn addition to technical improvements, the 5.11 Update also introduces a new map and biome. In the months leading to 5.11’s launch, Crytek plans to address community and survey feedback. That includes improved reporting systems to address cheating and toxic player behavior, design reworks tackling hunter revival, health chunks, restorations, burning down hunters, and reducing stalemates. The game is also getting a new user interface, and Crytek will continue evolving the game's recruitment and prestige progression requirements. \nHunt: Showdown first launched for Xbox and PC in 2019, with the PS4 version arriving in 2020. The PvPvE first-person shooter is set in 1865 Louisiana as players, either alone or with two or three friends, hunt supernatural bounties in the bayou while fending off other player-controlled bounty hunters. \nFor more on Crytek, you can read about the studio's next big project, Crysis 4.",

The pre-rendered trailer features no gameplay (as near as I can tell) and tells the story of Miquella and the war that sent them to the Land of Shadow. The footage hints at a location around the Lands Between that you and others will presumably visit.\n\n\nElden Ring's Shadow of the Erdtree DLC will be released on June 21 and will not be a standalone expansion. It requires ownership of the original game and will cost $39.99. A physical collector's Edition of the DLC package will also be available for $249.99 and will include a statue.

The publisher is in the midst of a structural reform that led to a swath of layoffs across its California and UK offices last week.",

But it seems like the fallout from this recent boom in popularity hasn't died down quite yet. Thanks to a teaser shared on Fortnite's official social media pages, we know that Fallout will be coming to Fortnite pretty soon\npic.twitter.com/AKjFXVnHST\nMay 17, 2024\nThe teaser image shows power armor in a cloud of orange dust, accompanied by what appears to be some sort of industrial building. Other than that, there's not much to go on, but we can make educated guesses. For one, Fortnite's current season will end on May 24, so this is the perfect time to tease the skins that might be coming in the next battle pass. And if it's anything like the recent Avatar: The Last Airbender and Star Wars crossovers, we might see Fallout-themed mechanics or areas appear on the battle royale map itself.\nIt will almost certainly involve some sort of cosmetic pack as well, which could include characters from the games, the Amazon Prime show, or both. Thanks to the teaser, we know power armor will be making an appearance, but it's unclear whether it will be an item to equip in-game or a skin that can be unlocked or purchased.\nFor more Fortnite news, read about its recent crossover with Billie Eilish, its decision to allow players to block certain emotes, and its huge and mysterious collaboration with Disney.\nWhat are you hoping to see included in this crossover?

          "description": "Microsoft is reportedly planning to launch this year's Call of Duty on its Xbox Game Pass subscription service, according to The Wall Stree Journal. This follows reports in previous weeks indicating Microsoft and Xbox were mulling over whether or not to launch the next iteration in the franchise on Game Pass, out of fear it might hurt sales. \nAfter acquiring Activision Blizzard for a colossal $69 billion last year, fans and analysts have speculated about how Microsoft will handle the Call of Duty franchise moving forward. It will obviously be a big draw for Xbox Game Pass, pulling in new subscribers, but most every year, the new Call of Duty is the best-selling game of the year – save for last year, where Hogwarts Legacy took that crown – and a Game Pass launch could affect those sales numbers. \n\n\nHowever, this new report from The Wall Street Journal seemingly clears the air around that topic. \n\"Microsoft plans a major shake up of its video game sales strategy by releasing the coming installment of Call of Duty to its subscription service instead of the longtime, lucrative approach of only selling it a la carte,\" the story reads. \nOf course, things could change so we'll see what happens. It's likely we'll be learning what the next Call of Duty game is next month as part of the gaming showcase summer that includes Summer Game Fest, Ubisoft Forward, and an Xbox Games Showcase followed by a secret direct that is probably focused on Call of Duty.\n[Source: The Wall Street Journal]\nWhat setting do you hope the next Call of Duty takes place in?

          "description": "2K will reveal the next iteration of one of its biggest franchises at Summer Game Fest. Fans online are already speculating what it could be, considering some of 2K's biggest franchises are prime for a new game. \nAs for when to expect this new game, the official SGF X (formerly Twitter) account says it will be announced on June 7, during the Summer Game Fest livestream that begins at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET. That's less than a month away so we don't have to speculate too long on what this mystery iteration could be. \n2K plans to reveal the next iteration in one of 2K's biggest and most beloved franchises at @SummerGameFest on Friday, June 7. pic.twitter.com/1vyFXE2N4z\nMay 16, 2024\nWhile there are plenty of 2K franchises that fit the bill, our eyes are on three franchises: Borderlands, Mafia, and BioShock. \nThe last mainline Borderlands entry – Borderlands 3 – hit PlayStation, Xbox, and PC in 2019, and with the live-action Borderlands movie hitting theaters this August, a new game would make sense. However, we did just get New Tales From The Borderlands in 2022, if you're looking for something to play through in that universe. \nOn the Mafia front, the last mainline entry was Mafia III in 2016, although 2K released Mafia: Definitive Edition – a remake – in 2020. And we know the next Mafia game is in development, too, so it might be time for an announcement. \nBioShock has been dormant since BioShock Infinite in 2013, unless you count the 2016 remasters, and we know 2K created Cloud Chamber in 2019 to work on the next entry in the franchise. It's been almost five years since then, so SGF seems like a great moment to announce the next BioShock. Speaking of, here's what we want in a BioShock 4. \nSGF returns to Los Angeles next month, with the live showcase happening on June 7. For more, check out some of the studios, publishers, and partners to be featured during the event, and then check out Game Informer's summer gaming showcase schedule. \nWhat do you think this new iteration will be?

          "description": "Grand Theft Auto VI's reveal last December sent fans into a tizzy, but its then-distant 2025 release window immediately tempered that excitement. While the launch seemed more in reach now that we’re nearly midway through 2024, it appears we’ll have to wait another full year before playing it.\nPublisher Take-Two released its 2024 year-end financial report today (thanks, PC Gamer), in which it states that Rockstar is targeting a Fall 2025 release window for GTA VI. This timing is reiterated in a calendar of the publisher’s upcoming releases, posted below.\nRegarding GTA VI, Take-Two states, “We are highly confident that Rockstar Games will deliver an unparalleled entertainment experience, and our expectations for the commercial impact of the title continue to increase.” The game is slated to release for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. A PC version has yet to be mentioned. \nGrand Theft Auto VI takes players to a modern-day Vice City (the franchise's parody of Miami, FL) and stars two protagonists, a female inmate named Lucia and her still-unnamed criminal male partner. To say anticipation is high would be an understatement; the premiere trailer garnered over 100 million views in only 24 hours, breaking a YouTube record. \nAs we continue the long wait for Grand Theft Auto VI’s launch, check out our video of Game Informer’s two resident Florida Men reacting to the debut trailer. You can also read about Take-Two's recent closure of developers Roll7 (Rollerdrome, OlliOlli World) and Intercept Games (Kerbal Space Program 2).",

          "description": "Ghost of Tsushima, specifically the Director's Cut, is out on PC today. It's a fantastic game that should be welcomed with open arms as it makes its way to a new platform, but we were specifically curious about how it performs on Steam Deck. The game is not Steam Deck verified primarily because certain features are not supported on Valve's handheld, or other comparable mobile PC game platforms. However, the offline content (the single-player campaign and the expansion) has been specifically adjusted to play well on Steam Deck. You can read port studio Nixxes Software explanation here. And spending a little time with the game shows that the single-player campaign does, in fact, play well on Steam Deck. It's not without its shortcomings – a high-end PC or a PlayStation 5 are still the best ways to play the game – but Steam Deck appears to be a great way to play the game if that's your only option or you want a portable version.\nYou can check out some gameplay with commentary from myself and Wesley LeBlanc below.\n\n\nHead to Game Informer's YouTube channel for more previews, reviews, and discussions of new and upcoming games.

While the company has yet to publicly address the closures directly, Xbox president Sarah Bond said in an interview that the closures were about keeping the business healthy in the long-term. It's why news of this new studio might be surprising, given one week ago, the parent company of Activision was closing studios to cut costs. \n\n\n\"Built from the ground up, Elsewhere Entertainment is a premier and standalone studio dedicated to establishing an environment that inspires bold and diverse ideas,\" a blog post reads. \"The team's underlying mission encourages everyone to explore and collaborate creatively to craft a franchise with an enduring legacy that resonates far beyond games. [The] new studio has full access to Activision's resources and tools as it continues to increase production and development. \n\"Elsewhere is opening its search for best-in-class talent from across the industry and around the world to help create a state-of-the-art and next generation gaming experience.\" \nElsewhere is currently made up of developers with experience working on franchises like The Last of Us, Uncharted, The Witcher, Cyberpunk 2077, Destiny, Tom Clancy's The Division, and Far Cry. \nWhat kind of game do you hope Elsewhere makes?

The game has only been available in PC Early Access since April 26, meaning it achieved this milestone in only three weeks.\nPublisher Hooded Horse announced the sales account for Steam, Epic, GOG, and the Microsoft Store (where Manor Lords is also playable through PC Game Pass). The game quickly caught fire, selling 1 million copies a day after launch. Since then, Manor Lords has enjoyed a consistently high concurrent player count, peaking at 173,000 on Steam in its first weekend.  \n\n\nManor Lords is being developed by Slavic Games and puts players in the shoes of a medieval lord tasked with building and growing a city. Players manage their city’s community, infrastructure, economy, and defense/expansion, the latter of which unfold as large-scale tactical battles. The intricate social and production systems combined with an ever-changing world (complete with seasonal and weather changes) result in an organic metropolis that players have taken to in a big way. \nManor Lords joins Early Access hits this year, such as Palworld and Hades II. The game’s 1.0 launch is currently up in the air as the game continues to change and improve based on player feedback. It’s off to a great start, though, and we’re curious to see how it evolves throughout its EA period.",

The company did so after word online spread that Shadows requires a mandatory online connection to play the game. \nFollowing the reveal of Shadows yesterday, which showcased the dual samurai and shinobi protagonists we'll be controlling in 16th-century feudal Japan, people noticed wording in preorder listings and elsewhere that seemingly pointed to the game requiring an always-online connection. This frustrated fans of the series, especially given Shadows, like its recent predecessors, is a single-player game. However, that's not the case and Ubisoft released a statement today to clear the air. \n\n\n\"Hey everyone, we wanted to share some of the early information on the upcoming launch of Assassin's Creed Shadows, following some questions we've noticed in the community,\" the statement reads. \"Assassin's Creed Shadows will not require a mandatory connection at all times. An online connection will be needed to install the game, but you will be able to play the entire journey offline, and explore Japan without any online connection. \n\n\"We are super excited to bring Assassin's Creed to Feudal Japan on November 15 when the game releases, and we cannot wait to show you more along the way.\" \n\nAs you can see, it's clear Shadows is a game you can play offline, but only after connecting to the internet once to actually install the RPG. \nAssassin's Creed Shadows hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Amazon Luna, PC (via the Ubisoft Store and Epic Games Store), and Mac (with Apple silicon via the Mac App Store) on November 15.\nFor more, check out what we learned yesterday during the Shadows reveal, and then read Game Informer's ranking of the entire Assassin's Creed series.\nHow do you feel about needing internet to install Assassin's Creed Shadows?

          "description": "Ubisoft has canceled The Division Heartland. First announced in 2021, the game was a free-to-play spin-off of The Division franchise developed by Red Storm Studio.\nUbisoft revealed the cancelation in an earnings report, stating,\n“As part of Ubisoft’s efforts to streamline its operations and adapt to evolving market trends, there have been further reorganizations within the Global Publishing teams, both at the APAC region, that is not organized into three engagement hubs, and at the central level. Additionally, in line with the increased selectivity of its investments, Ubisoft has decided to stop development on The Division Heartland and has redeployed resources to bigger opportunities such as XDefiant and Rainbow Six.”\n\n\nThe Division Heartland had been quiet for some time after its reveal, including being delayed. It eventually resurfaced with closed beta tests, but scarce updates on its existence caused doubt and confusion among fans. The game was billed as a PvEvP survival action experience with players controlling a Division agent tasked with protecting a small town from enemy factions and chemical contamination. \nDespite the cancellation, we know it doesn't mean the end of the franchise. Ubisoft announced The Division 3 last September, with series creator Massive Entertainment back at the helm. That game currently has no release window. \nHeartland joins an expanding graveyard of canceled Ubisoft projects over the past few years. In January 2023, the publisher canceled its upcoming team-based arena battler Project Q and three other games in development. In 2022, the battle royale Ghost Recon Frontline, Splinter Cell VR, and two unannounced games were also axed. An unannounced sequel to Immortals Fenix Rising was also reportedly scrapped last July.",

It will be released on November 15.\nThis dual protagonist approach isn't too surprising given it's Ubisoft Quebec developing the game – it did the same with Kassandra and Alexios in 2018's Assassin's Creed Odyssey and Jacob and Evie Frye in 2015's Assassin's Creed Syndicate – but it's exciting nonetheless.

It stars four friends who set out to create a horror film at a derelict steel mill dubbed Murder Mill. Naturally, that goes as horribly as you’d imagine, and players must survive by making choices that decide the characters’ relationships and fates. Sudden quick-time events can also be the deciding factor between whether someone lives or dies. \n\n\nSimilar to Supermassive’s previous titles like The Quarry and the Dark Pictures Anthology, The Casting of Frank Stone can go down multiple paths based on your choices.

Like Amazon's Fallout series, this Tomb Raider show will premiere exclusively on Prime Video to more than 240 countries and territories around the world. \nThis series order arrives as part of a larger deal between Amazon MGM Studios and Tomb Raider reboot developer Crystal Dynamics, which is currently working on a new Tomb Raider game in Unreal Engine 5. In December of 2022, we learned Amazon Games will publish that in-development Tomb Raider game, which Amazon describes as a \"single-player, narrative-driven adventure that will add a new chapter to Lara Croft's story in the Tomb Raider series.\" \n\"With great IP, the possibilities are endless,\" Amazon Games vice president Christoph Hartmann writes in a press release. \"The richness and depth of the fiction allows the Tomb Raider series from Prime Video and the video game from Amazon Games to tell separate stories about Lara Croft's adventures. We're honored that Crystal Dynamics has entrusted Amazon with this iconic franchise, and we're looking forward to seeing where this collaboration takes us.\" \nThis is the second upcoming TV adaptation to star the iconic treasure hunter. Netflix's animated series Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft, starring Haley Atwell, is set to premiere sometime this year. That particular show is set within the continuity of Crystal Dynamic's reboot trilogy, taking place after the events of Shadow of the Tomb Raider. \nIf you're curious about Crystal Dynamics' recent Tomb Raider reboot, you can pick up Tomb Raider: Game of the Year Edition on PC via GOG for free if you're an Amazon Prime member throughout May.
