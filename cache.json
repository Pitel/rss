Today, Ollie sings the praises of Ocarina of Time's mystical opening location, Kokiri Forest...\n\nBefore Ocarina of Time launched back in 1998, the Legend of Zelda franchise didn’t really provide players with a good opportunity to acclimatise to its world. Think about it: both NES games threw you into the middle of Hyrule with little introduction, A Link to the Past saw you almost immediately infiltrate Hyrule Castle’s dungeon, and while Link’s Awakening started off in the cosy confines of Tarin’s house, it's not long before you're on the beaches of Koholint Island, surrounded by Sand Crabs, Leevers, and Octoroks.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

This was a team consisting of many of the minds behind Banjo-Kazooie, Donkey Kong Country, and other such classics, so when their first title, Yooka-Laylee was released in 2017, we were relieved to see that level of creativity still very much alive and kicking (even more so with the improved Switch version later that year).\nPlaytonic would go on to release the side-scrolling platformer Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair in 2019, a title that we felt took all of the best bits of its predecessor and improved on them — awarding it a 9/10 in our review, no less. While the studio has since been behind several games on the publishing side of things (Lil Gator Game, Demon Turf, and many more) a good few years have passed since it was last in the development seat.

This story-driven RPG is ideal for fans of titles like Undertale and EarthBound. Don’t take that comparison to mean that it is identical to these games, though — it’s still its own experience.\nRight off the bat, In Stars and Time looks great, with 4:3 aspect ratio that makes it feel more retro than it actually is. The music is gentle and soothing, and it pairs perfectly with the monochrome art style. The menu and settings are easy to navigate from the off, and the story starts with a detailed trigger warning; the game does have some text-based depictions of topics like suicide, which is worth being mindful of. Nothing is shown, but the dialogue is intense in places.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Mazes and labyrinths can be confusing, frustrating, oppressive, nightmarish. They are the kinds of structures videogame developers are reluctant to put in their games, because the potential for the player losing heart or patience is relatively high. But as productions, they can be strangely economical, oddly light-footed. Mazes and labyrinths, after all, twist up space and as such, discover or create additional space within space. They allow vast journeys to happen within areas that are modest when judged in terms of square footage, journeys that encompass a multitude of locations that have an inherent, automatic atmosphere: tantalising forks in the path and mocking dead ends, hubs with corridors leading in all directions, leisurely perimeter paths and gristly knots of inner passages.\nAs such, I think they're useful to reflect on at a time when the mantra of growth for its own sake has conquered the heart of videogame world design: bigger budgets for grander maps in terms of both explorable area and computational resource, all the way to Armageddon (did you know that Suicide Squad's Metropolis is twice the size of Arkham Knight's Gotham City?). But don't take it from me, an armchair developer with armchair socialist sensibilities. Take it from The Legend of Zelda.\nRead more",

Forget the operatic choral chants of Final Fantasy bosses. The new rallying cry against peak villainy is now some no-nonsense British commentary about the state of human extinction. It works surprisingly, well, and Small Saga is a game shot through with these kinds of Britishisms, set in the parks, streets and underbelly of modern-day London. \nOnly this isn't an RPG about humans, but the rodents that live beneath their feet - the mice, rats, squirrels and moles who have developed a kind of proto-medieval society of their own built from the trash and discarded objects they've scavenged from under our noses. In this world, humans are terrifying 'gods', supermarkets with their shelves of seeds and grain are called 'Heaven', and your main mode of transportation is a pigeon with a wicker basket. It's a fascinating world solo developer Darya Noghani has created here, and it would be a thrilling turn-based RPG, too - if only its battles didn't completely cheese it when it comes to providing any sense of challenge.\nRead more",

I love how it looks, I love what it does, and I will endlessly admire how its little multi-coloured building bricks morph and shift, smooshed together in far more creative ways than I could ever manage myself. But when presented with a blank canvas and no direction on what to do with said multi-coloured building bricks, my mind seizes up and straight up refuses to extract any joy from it. It's a feeling I fear will apply to the equally charming Tiny Glade when that eventually comes out as well, based on the very lovely GIFs I've seen of it so far, and honestly, there are times when I worry my brain is just a teeny bit broken and I have lost the ability to find joy in what are clearly very joyful little creations.\nBut then I play games like Pile Up!, a micro citybuilder that's very much in the same vein as Townscaper, and realise, oh no, I do just need some objectives and structure to my game playing for everything to be fine again. \nRead more",

Besides quality gunplay and a fantastic array of classic maps, MW3's multiplayer doesn't do much to differentiate itself from MW2, aside from being more of a frustrating grind. And its awkwardly positioned zombies mode, though it might appeal to some, has been robbed of its sickle-sharpening soul. All of it does smack of being rushed, and I'd only recommend the game if you're an ardent fan of COD who's happy to accept little in the way of changes.

Originally published in 1989 by Interstel Corporation and distributed by a little-known company called Electronic Arts, it's an absurdly in-depth and fiddly-looking space sim in which you fly around a randomly generated cosmos in your horrible Klingon-adjacent battlecruiser, blowing up or commandeering other ships, bombarding or invading planets, and generally speaking being a nuisance. \r\n\n\r\nAccording to its creators, Trevor Sorensen and Mark Baldwin, the game had a rushed launch that led to a lot of technical issues. The developers released another, relatively bug-free version in 1991, which is the version you'll find on most retro game preservation sites. Then, in 2018, Sorensen decided to make a new 2.0 version of Krellan Commander using his original 486 PC, which finally launched this week on Steam and GOG. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Naheulbeuk’s Dungeon Master is a staff management game disguised as a dungeon management game. At the start of each week, your minions might choose to go on strike, demanding everything from more cells in the prison to fewer dwarves in the workplace. If that second example elicited a startled little “yikes”, then good, you’re paying attention. Your minions are also occasional racists – which at least makes some of the more brutal options at hand for dealing with striking workers more palatable.\r\n\n\r\nYou can sacrifice the entire picket line to your in-house demon lord, or terminate their employment without tribunal. You can also lock them up in those prisons they repeatedly claim are so lacking in cells. Or you can agree to their terms to expand the canteen and sack all of their shortest colleagues. But no matter which option you choose, minion strikes are inconsequential, only ever amounting to a comedy aside. Just as the turn-based Dungeon Of Naheulbeuk set out to skewer D&D, Naheulbeuk’s Dungeon Master is a brave and self-aware parody of dungeon management games. But it's far too barebones to invest in seriously.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The same could probably be said of any game this year in particular, but having spent over 20 years shepherding the art teams at Firaxis on Civilization, XCOM, Sid Meier's Pirates, Alpha Centauri and most recently Marvel's Midnight Suns, Foertsch has seen firsthand what it takes for strategy games to break new ground over the years, and what an arduous road it's been for the genre to get where it is today. Not only was it \"late to party on 3D, they were late to the party on consoles,\" but it's also \"suffered from lower budgets, which means it just hasn't pushed in the way that other genres have,\" he says. \nEven now, \"it's got some catching up to do,\" he continues, but there are plenty of reasons to be positive, too. As we speak at the beginning of September, our conversation quickly turns to Baldur's Gate 3, whose enormous success Foertsch cites as a clear and obvious sign that \"there's a thirst for something different now,\" both within RPG circles and, perhaps a little unexpectedly, for strategy heads as well. It's his hope that his own upcoming project, the closely guarded Star Wars strategy game his new studio Bit Reactor are working on in collaboration with Respawn, will follow in these lauded footsteps. \"We want to make a game and just have people say, 'Man, that's amazing game, and oh, it happens to be strategy.'

Victory is dependent on rapidly issuing movement, attack and ability commands to several small squads of soldiers, and your units will pay a heavy price if your attention leaves them for more than a few moments.\r\n\nIf that's not your thing, move along. If it is, Realms Of Ruin is a solid, button-down war 'em up and you should read on.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "If you’ve been enjoying Jusant, Don’t Nod’s post-apocalyptic climbing sim, you might also like the alpha playtest for Chasing The Unseen, which has just been updated with a new level. It doesn’t have Jusant’s quietly innovative grip and abseiling mechanics – the climbing is closer to Shadow Of The Colossus, consisting of just one button you hold to cling on till your stamina runs out. Nor does it have the Don’t Nod game's beautifully nested chunks of backstory - no seashells you can press your ear to, alas. But it does have massive flying cephalopods, giant red mushrooms, and floating, fractured landscapes of rock and grass. \r\n\nThe gameworld drifts whimsically between categories, neither macroscopic nor microscopic, at times a kind of ocean reef, and at other times, a mysterious, alternate dimension we might summarise as “Cthulhu’s Zen Chillout Room”. The climbing aside, you can glide short distances by inflating what looks like a blowfish, and there are (regular-sized) capybara to chase down and collect. When you die, the game plays a didgeridoo at you in a faintly jocular way. The whole thing pongs of quantum physics.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's still a co-op multiplayer affair, however.\r\n\n\r\nThe reboot follows an evaluation period during which Remedy and publisher Tencent discussed a proof-of-concept version of the game, as we reported last month. They've now kicked it back to the concept phase \"due to uncertainties in creating a successful game [in] the rapidly changing free-to-play market and associated risks\".

Spirittea from Edmonton, Canada-based Cheesemaker Games is Spirited Away in the guise of a Stardew Valley-style management sim. Released today, it casts you as a wholesome young entrepreneur who has just arrived in a town full of rogue supernatural creatures. To free the town from its spectral infestation, you must renovate an old mountain bathhouse and treat each phantom to a jolly good scrub. You might also need to deal with some Unfinished Business, such as tracking down a lost possession. At least there's no witch to worry about. That I know of, anyway.\r\n\n\r\nI have fond memories of Spirited Away - it was the film that re-introduced me to anime as an undergraduate, following the traditional early-career middlebrow otaku phase of obsessing over Akira, Cowboy Bebop and Ghost in the Shell while turning my nose up at stuff like Naruto, because it's \"just for kids\". I was on the brink of pitching a Spirittea review, but then our reviews editor Ed Thorn emerged howling and gibbering from the floorboards and asked me to review a 100-hour RPG instead (won't spoil), so I'll have to settle for trying the demo.\r\n \nRead more",

We could call it the \"horseshuwu effect\".\r\n\n\r\nAs evidence of this, please witness the unholy magnificence of Saccharinity of Starfield, a Starfield mod from lucyprrrr and the Sakura Candy Society, which treats Starfield's items, spaceships, buildings, vegetation, planet models and, worst of all, people to a barbie-doll makeover reminiscent of a seriously overclocked shoujo anime. Do you like pink? No you don't. Not this much. \r\n\n \nRead more",

As such, I'm tickled gall-bladder-pink to hear that Blizzard consider the action-RPG series \"a wonderful platform\" for different types of game, now that they've made the leap to an open world format. \r\n\n\r\nFor the most part, said experimentation will occur in the course of Diablo 4 expansions - the first of which, Diablo 2 throwback Vessel of Hatred, will launch in late 2024, adding a new class to the game described as \"never before seen in the Diablo universe\". But from the sounds of things, there's scope for the \"franchise in general\" to evolve too.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The subscription service is adding free trials for a bizarre duo: Baldur’s Gate 3 and The Lord of the Rings Gollum. \n\n\nLOTR fans will get to check out Gollum for a full hour, and based on the game’s terrible reception, that might be more than enough time with it. Gollum has a Top Critic Score of just 37 on OpenCritic, with only 4% of critics recommending it. \n\n\nFollowing the game’s release in May 2023, publisher Daedlic Entertainment closed its development studio in Hamburg, Germany and canceled its plans for another game set in Middle-Earth. Now, any PlayStation players who skipped out on the game thanks to the rough reviews can get a chance to evaluate it for themselves.\n\n\nBaldur’s Gate 3, on the other hand, is one of the most celebrated games of the year. The massive CRPG has been blowing everyone away since it debuted in August. It earned eight nominations at The Game Awards, including Game of the Year and Best Game Direction for Larian Studios. \n\n\nIt’s one of those games that stays deeply engaging even after hundreds of hours, so the two hour trial coming to PlayStation Plus Premium will hardly be enough for players to get a taste of what the game has to offer. That said, the opening hours are exciting enough that the trial will likely snag more than a few new players for the game. \n\n\nBoth of the trials are currently available through the PlayStation Store. \n\nThe post PlayStation Plus Premium gets trials for Baldur’s Gate 3 and LOTR Gollum appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "After Enclave HD made its way to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch back in June, a December 5 date has been locked in for PlayStation 5.\n\n\nSomehow, it's been over two decades since the original Enclave launched on Xbox in 2002. The medieval action-RPG was developed by Starbreeze Studios, and the HD version from TopWare Interactive and Ziggurat Interactive adds in updated visuals, an enhanced soundtrack, and some quality-of-life improvements. The results might not exactly be the most PS5 looking game in the world, but it does include exclusive haptic trigger effects for the DualSense controller. \n\n\nYou can see some quick action-packed footage in the PS5 release date trailer:\n\n\n\n\nEnclave lets you fight as either a goodie or a baddie — very real technical terms — with six class options available for each faction. The story puts you in the land of Celenheim, which experienced a rift between the forces of Light and Darkness a thousand years ago. The rift protected Celenheim's people from the vile Dreg'Atar, but now that it's beginning to close that peace could soon come to an end. Thus, it's time for everyone's favorite \"unlikely\" hero to rise up! Or you could just be a nasty lil' champion of evil. It's up to you.\n\n\nIt's been about, oh, 20 years since I played Enclave myself, but I remember it being a pretty engrossing and challenging game at the time. I haven't played the HD version yet, so I can't personally say how well it holds up in 2023. Either way, with this launch we'll have Enclave HD on all major consoles. \n\nThe post Enclave HD makes its PS5 debut on December 5 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It feels like Steam has some sort of sales event almost on a weekly basis. Recently, we had the Scream Fest to celebrate Halloween, and now we're getting another one as we head towards the tail end of November.\n\n\nAs always with these things, we can never be 100% sure of what games will be discounted. However, if you take a look at the video below, there are a few major titles that do crop up, suggesting they will part of Steam's next sale.\n\n\n\n\nWe're treated to clips from the likes of Hitman 3, Star Wars: Jedi Survivor, Sons of the Forest, The Last of Us: Part 1, and even Starfield. The Autumn event begins November 21 and goes through until November 28, and with such a line-up, it looks like it'll be an interesting one to keep an eye on.\n\n\nIt's been quite the year\n\n\nAs we edge ever closer to the closing weeks of 2023, many of us will start reflecting on the last twelve months that have been and gone. While this year has been great for video game releases, a lot of joy has been sullied by the ongoing (and rather brutal) layoffs that have occurred across the industry in general.\n\n\nAs such, it's been quite the rollercoaster, but things seem to be trundling along unabated, and the Steam Autumn sale event is just one example.\n\n\nOf course, Christmas is coming up soon, so we'll be seeing the Winter sale go live over the holiday period. Nothing like a ruck of discounted games at a time when everyone's spending too much money anyway.\n\nThe post Steam Autumn Sale begins this week, looks like it’s going to be a good ‘un appeared first on Destructoid.",

In fact, according to Steam Charts, the horror experience has reached a peak player total of 114,672 at the time of writing.\n\n\n\n\n“While I was asleep Lethal Company passed 100,000 concurrent players,” the developer wrote in a post on Twitter. “Unbelievable, thank you for playing. Releasing updates for this game will be very fun.”\n\n\nLethal Company entered Early Access on Steam on October 23, so the fact that less than a month later it’s celebrating over 100,000 concurrent players is kind of amazing, especially for a game made by a solo developer who got their start on the Roblox platform.\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the peak players announcement, Zeekerss wrote via Twitter that Lethal Company’s “next enemy is seasonal,” but the developer made certain to clarify they used the word “enemy” intentionally. “These ones will not be 'creatures' as I refer to the rest. These are Enemies. Antagonists. Combatants. Foes. Enjoy this pre-invasion time.”\n\n\nIn the replies, one user asked if their usage of the word “seasonal” implied the new enemy would only be present in the game temporarily. Zeekerss clarified that their use of the word “seasonal” was meant to suggest the enemy itself will be themed around the holiday season.\n\n\n\n\nLethal Company entered Early Access on October 23. In the co-op experience, players must salvage from “abandoned, industrialized moons” in order to fulfill their obligations to a mysterious “Company.” But, there’s a reason it’s co-op — while you’re hunting scrap, something else is hunting you. It is available via PC, and there are no indications at the moment of a console release. \n\nThe post Co-op horror game Lethal Company hits over 100k concurrent players on Steam appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "In a post on Twitter, Square Enix revealed that the previously mobile-only title Final Fantasy 7: Ever Crisis has been published to Steam and will be released on the platform later. The Gacha-style game revisits the story of Final Fantasy 7 and Final Fantasy 7: Crisis Core while also telling a new original story about Sephiroth in his younger days.\n\n\n\n\nSOLDIER 1st Class\n\n\nOur very own Timothy \"The Wordsmith\" Monbleau wrote about his feelings on Final Fantasy 7: Ever Crisis when it was released on mobile devices a couple of months ago. I've also had the chance to play quite a bit of it—well, completed all the original content in the title, at least—and can say everything he mentions is pretty on point. Even though the idea of more FF7 is always appealing...this isn't the way to do it. FF7:EC feels like a gacha game was developed and then a FF7 skin was thrown onto it.\n\n\nHowever, I know even with the warning, some people just want more Final Fantasy. Even though you could previously access Final Fantasy 7: Ever Crisis through emulators like BlueStacks, this will be the first time it's easily and officially available on PC. New players who jump in on the Steam version will also get the pre-order rewards that were available on mobile. The rewards will help you get a jump start on progressing through the early missions, so it's a cool touch that they are giving the rewards to PC players as well.\n\n\nThere's no release date yet for when Final Fantasy 7: Ever Crisis will actually go live on Steam. According to the Twitter post, the release date will be announced soon.\n\n\n\nThe post Final Fantasy 7: Ever Crisis is coming to Steam appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's hard to imagine, and it's even harder to imagine it's still going strong, as evidenced by recent statistics.\n\n\nSpurred by this milestone birthday, Half-Life has received an influx of players, with SteamDB reporting the game's highest player count on record. Over the last 24 hours, 33,471 players have jumped back into the world of Black Mesa, the most it's ever achieved, according to the history.\n\n\nScreenshot via Destructoid.\n\n\nGoing back as far as possible, the graph shows that, aside from a few spikes here and there, the game has retained a fairly steady flow of players. Until recently, of course. At the time of writing, nearly 19,000 people are playing right now. That's more than Starfield.\n\n\nThat's a lot of resonance cascades\n\n\nIt's no secret why Half-Life is experiencing a boon right now. To go with the 25th anniversary, Valve released a new update for the game, as well as a special documentary about the development of this absolute classic.\n\n\nAs such, it's on a lot of people's minds right now, and understandably so. Featuring one of the most iconic openings in an FPS, Half-Life raised the bar for what was possible in video game technology and storytelling.\n\n\nIf you've never played it before, now's your chance, as it's currently free on Steam. We might take a lot of its elements for granted these days but, take it from an aging gamer, this stuff was revolutionary at the time.\n\nThe post Half-Life reaches its highest ever player peak on its 25th birthday appeared first on Destructoid.",

Krueger also reflects on this and expresses pride in all the accomplishments his team has earned. \n\n\nIlari Kuittinen, who is the General Manager and Co-Founder of Housemarque, also comments on Krueger's departure. He claims Krueger's \"passion and direction have been vital\" for the studio which has endured the death and rebirth of the \"Arcade\". \n\n\nAlthough Krueger doesn't explain what prompted the departure, he states that it was a difficult decision. He is also confident that the studio has a bright future ahead, as it has \"an exciting new project in the works, a fantastic team that’s stronger than ever, and the continuous support of Sony and PlayStation Studios.\"\n\n\nKrueger isn't the only notable industry figure who has stepped down from a long-held position.

Until Valve takes it upon itself to carry on with the series, fans will take the reins in an unofficial capacity. And that's exactly what's happened here.\n\n\nPortal: Revolution is not exactly a threequel to the Portal universe. Instead, it's actually a prequel that takes place before the events of the second game. Brought to us by Second Face Software, this mod comes complete with eight hours of gameplay, which includes more than 40 new test chambers. You can also check out the special \"100,000 trailer views\" Q&A video while you're at it.\n\n\n\n\nThe above trailer almost looks like an official new entry or something Valve would put together. As a community project, it definitely looks impressive, fitting in between the two installments with its own story and characters. It should be noted that you will need a legitimate copy of Portal 2 before you can use this free mod.\n\n\nThe modding community strikes again\n\n\nYou can always depend on the fan base to keep video game universes alive. Portal 2 recently got its own VR mode, thanks to the dedicated community, which is good seeing as Portal 3 is probably never going to happen. Prove me wrong though, Valve. Prove me wrong.\n\n\nWe've circled this proverbial airport many times before, especially when it comes to Half-Life. The continuation of Gordon Freeman's story is a dream many are struggling to hold onto these days.\n\n\nWithout any official sequels in the make that we're aware of, we can at least take solace in the unofficial stuff that's out there. Portal: Revolution is just one example of people showing they're not ready to accept Valve's unwillingness to bring us something new (Half-Life: Alyx notwithstanding, of course).\n\nThe post Portal: Revolution is a mod that’s keeping the Portal universe alive appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "After years and years of waiting, fans are about to get their deepest look yet at the Dragon’s Dogma sequel. \n\n\nCapcom has just announced that a showcase for the game will be held on Tuesday, November 28, at 1PM PST. Fans can tune in for a 15-minute livestream that promises to reveal a ton of new info about the game while also showing off some never-before-seen gameplay. \n\n\n\n\nThe original Dragon’s Dogma debuted all the way back in 2012, and fans have been dying for a sequel ever since. That’s not to say there hasn’t been other Dragon’s Dogma content in the past decade. Netflix released a one-season anime in 2020, and there have been two spinoff games: 2013’s Dragon’s Dogma Arisen and the Japanese exclusive Dragon’s Dogma Online. \n\n\nCapcom officially revealed that Dragon’s Dogma 2 was in the works as part of the original game’s 10th anniversary celebration, offering a first real look at the game in June 2023. Destructoid's own Timothy Monbleau got to spend some time hands-on with the game, calling Dragon's Dogma 2 \"a game that just wants to be a good ol’ fun time over literally anything else, even if it means getting cheesy or silly.\" \n\n\nSo far, it’s looked like Dragon’s Dogma 2 will offer even more of what we all loved about the original, and that would be a definite win. \n\n\nThe biggest question looming over the upcoming showcase is the game's release date. Capcom hasn’t said anything about that yet, but with director Hideaki Itsuno and producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi, this would be the perfect time to drop the news. We’ll just have to wait and see. \n\nThe post A Dragon’s Dogma 2 showcase will air at the end of November appeared first on Destructoid.",

Next up for the game is a release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch in spring 2024. The team has been working on a big chunk of content that was originally planned for sometime in Q4 2023, but it's being pushed back to coincide with the console launch due to \"development and porting adjustments.\" \n\n\nThe update will launch on Steam around that time and will be available in the console versions along with all other previously-released updates. As for what the update entails, there are two new areas, over 300 new rooms, and a Boss Rush Mode. There's also a Maya Mode, which lets you play through as Maya for a taste of a new play style. Speedrun mode rules apply there, so just don't expect any new dialogue additions or endings. \n\n\nA short teaser was released along with the announcement to show off a tiny slice of new footage:\n\n\n\n\nThe footage may be brief, but it definitely sounds like there's a lot for players to look forward to when the update launches. \"As you can see, we have probably enjoyed making this update a little too much,\" the devs said in the announcement.

The recap comes as both Square Enix and fans are counting down the days until Rebirth's release on February 29, 2024.\n\n\n\n\nThe recap starts with a description of Midgar and the ShinRa Electric Power Company, set to a chilling rendition of Sephiroth’s theme. As Cloud, Barret and other members of Avalanche are introduced, the music starts to become more hopeful as Cloud meets Aerith following the Sector 8 reactor explosion. It quickly returns to the haunting choral melody as President Shinra and his employees are introduced.\n\n\nTo be honest, the recap does an excellent job of covering the basic plot points from Final Fantasy 7 Remake, though it does bypass the events of the Sector 6 slums, the Wall Market, Don Corneo’s Mansion, and everything else between meeting Aerith and the attack on Sector 7. It also doesn’t mention Zack’s inexplicable revival, which is interesting, given how important he seems to be in Rebirth.\n\n\nI must admit, though, seeing the fight against Sephiroth at the end of Remake again reminded me of how silly that final act was. Here’s hoping they’re able to make that fight and its ramifications make sense in Rebirth. It’s already been confirmed by Tetsuya Nomura that Rebirth will extend up to The Forgotten Capital, so things are already looking up in that regard. \n\n\nFinal Fantasy 7 Rebirth launches exclusively for the PlayStation 5 on February 29, 2024.\n\nThe post Square Enix shares a Final Fantasy 7 Remake recap ahead of Rebirth appeared first on Destructoid.",

Boy, do I have the game for you!\n\n\nMotesolo: No Girlfriend Since Birth was developed by Indicava Interactive, and as the name suggests, it follows the story of a man named Kimo Kang who's about to turn 30 and wants to finally find a romantic partner. This is no easy feat, as he's awkward, nervous, and unintentionally idiosyncratic. It arrives on November 30 on Nintendo Switch, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid. \n\n\nUnique and full of heart\n\n\nMotesolo was originally released in 2021, and it won the Indie Game Award at the Korea Game Awards. It currently sits with a \"Very Positive\" rating on Steam, but you should be aware of what you're getting yourself into. \n\n\nIt is a movie game, meaning that the game plays out through live-action scenes. You do have some control, and the way the story pans out depends on your input. For instance, when you're in a cafe waiting for your blind date, you can interact with many things, and even gain some items or information that'll help you on your date. You'll also have to pick dialog options that hopefully lead to a happy ending. \n\n\nYou can also interact with Kimo's cellphone where you're able to chat with his friends and watch videos that could potentially help you find romantic success. The story isn't entirely about Kimo, however. You also get to learn about his blind date, Yumi, who is willing to give Kimo a chance, but she'll have to deal with his occasionally cringe-inducing behavior. \n\n\n\n\nIt's a funny, heartwarming game that is carried by the good performances and humorous plot. Give it a shot; you may be surprised at how good it is at putting a smile on your face. \n\nThe post Quirky movie game Motesolo: No Girlfriend Since Birth coming to consoles on November 30 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Now, a new set of players can experience the classic stealth title as heads to iOS and Android at the end of November as Hitman: Blood Money - Reprisal.\n\n\nFeral Interactive, the same studio that brought us a slew of AAA titles to mobile, is back at it again. The developer dropped a trailer for Hitman: Blood Money - Reprisal that shows exactly what iOS and Android users should expect when the game releases on November 30.\n\n\n\n\nThe game's visuals remain on par with its PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360 predecessors. But the stealth game's interface has been completely reworked to suit mobile devices. There have also been a few new bells and whistles included for a better overall experience.\n\n\nInstinct Mode is something that's being brought to Reprisal from later games in the series. It highlights targets and critical mission points to make navigating maps a bit easier. \n\n\nA mini-map is also being introduced to Blood Money for the first time. It offers better feedback on Agent 47's surroundings, including alerts if the character is raising suspicions. As in the original, there are 12 sandbox missions for players to enjoy over and over again due to their highly replayable nature.\n\n\nControls for Hitman: Blood Money - Reprisal have been reworked, too so that users can create a UI that fits them best on the go. However, those who wish to utilize a gamepad or keyboard and mouse have that option too. \n\n\nHitman: Blood Money - Reprisal sneaks up on iOS and Android users on November 30. It's listed in the App Store and Google Play Store for $14.99. A Nintendo Switch port is also planned for some point in the winter. \n\nThe post Hitman: Blood Money – Reprisal comes to iOS and Android this month appeared first on Destructoid.",

Games like The Last of Us have become generation-defining titles, and with every release, he continues to push the limits of cinematic gameplay and storytelling. \n\n\nHis career trajectory has also been an impressive one.

          "description": "Yakuza: Like A Dragon was a very silly game in spite of its dramatic narrative, but its follow-up, Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, looks to give it a run for its money. Between letting Ichiban ride a dolphin and its Animal Crossing-style city-building mode, fans of the franchise’s goofball nature should be in for a treat, and a new batch of screenshots highlight this.\nThe images provide looks at Ichiban, Kiryu Joryu, and their returning friends, such as Nanba, Adachi, and Saeko, kicking butt in a variety of classes and looking absurd doing so. Other familiar faces will be playable party members for the first time, such as Seonhee, who is shown brutalizing opponents with a whip in the images. It's clear that Hawaii will never be the same once these guys are done with it. \n\n\nLike A Dragon: Infinite Wealth hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on January 26. You can learn more about the game and see it in action in this pair of trailers. Be sure to also read our review of its direct predecessor, Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, here.",

Spider-Man sees the friendly neighborhood hero battle a star-studded gallery of villains in an original adventure chock full of comic book goodness. As Spider-Man's first fully 3D action-adventure game, it laid the groundwork for mechanics such as web-swinging, a variety of web shooter attacks, and wall-crawling stealth gameplay.

          "description": "Final Fantasy VII Rebirth arrives in February, which isn’t too far on the horizon, so Square Enix is getting players prepared with a cinematic refresher of its predecessor, Final Fantasy VII Remake. The company pairs that with a batch of fresh screenshots and art, including the first glimpse of the Highwind airship. \nThe video sees Red XIII narrate the broad strokes of the 2020 adventure. While it doesn’t touch on the finer details and background of the characters, it provides a decent summary that's perhaps better served as a reminder for fans who played Remake rather than someone coming into Rebirth completely fresh. Unfortunately, the recap doesn’t touch on the events of the Intermission expansion that introduces Yuffie, who joins the party in Rebirth, so unfamiliar players will have to do their own homework on that. \n\n\nSquare has released some new images, including a piece of art depicting Aerith in front of the Highwind. The screenshots show off the town of Kalm, the summon Kujata, the abandoned Mythril Mine, and a few side characters. Oh, and Chadley is there too. \n\nFinal Fantasy VII Rebirth launches on February 29 for PlayStation 5. You can watch us play two demos of the game in this video and read our hands-on impressions here. You can also get the answers to some of Rebirth's burning questions in this interview with Square Enix.",

          "description": "Amazon is laying off 180 jobs in its games division, hopping on the tragically overcrowded bandwagon of layoffs in the game industry this year. The news comes via Aftermath, which reports that the layoffs are focused in two areas – the Crown Twitch channel, which will reportedly be eliminated altogether, and the game growth teams. Employees were notified of the changes through an email from Christoph Hartman, VP of Amazon Games. This is the second wave of layoffs this division of the company has faced this year.\nAn excerpt of the announcement email can be read below:\nThere have been so many layoffs in the gaming industry this year that it's getting hard to keep track of. Last week, we learned Free Radical Design is on the verge of closing down and that Ubisoft laid off more than 100 employees. The week before that, roughly 100 employees were laid off at Destiny 2 developer Bungie. \nIn January, Microsoft laid off 10,000 employees amidst its ongoing $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which it completed last month. \nIn August, Striking Distance Studios, the team behind last year's The Callisto Protocol, laid off more than 30 employees, and that same month, Mass Effect and Dragon Age developer BioWare laid off 50 employees, including long-time studio veterans. The following month, in September, Immortals of Aveum developer Ascendant Studios laid off roughly 45% of its staff. \nJust last month, The Last of Us developer Naughty Dog laid off at least 25 employees, and Telltale Games underwent layoffs as well, although an actual number of laid-off employees has not yet been revealed. And in late October, Dreams developer Media Molecule laid off 20 employees.\nThe hearts of Game Informer's staff are with the people laid off from Amazon Games, along with everyone else who has lost a job this year.\n[Source: Aftermath]",

It turns out plenty of others enjoyed developer Insomniac Games' latest superhero effort, too, because Sony has revealed that in just 11 days, it sold through more than 5 million copies, making it one of the year's best-selling games.\nFor context, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 outsold Super Mario Bros. Wonder, which is the fastest-selling Super Mario game after selling through 4.3 million copies in two weeks. Marvel's Spider-Man 2 was named the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game just three days after its release, too. \nWoo!

If you purchase a new Gundam model kit at your local store today, it originated in this facility in Shizuoka, Japan. The factory contains 35 plastic color-molding machines – 25 electric and 10 hydraulic – all helping produce millions of models yearly.\nBandai Spirits employee Miyuki Nakagiri, the subject matter expert on how exactly the factory operates, escorts us through the building. Our translator during this tour is Atsuo Yoshimura, a video game production manager who’s worked at Bandai Namco for the last 17 years. Notably, Yoshimura worked on last year’s Elden Ring – Game Informer’s 2022 Game of the Year, and most recently, Armored Core VI Fires of Rubicon. Additionally, Yoshimura was instrumental in helping to coordinate Game Informer’s recent Armored Core VI cover story trip. \nWatch Us Tour Japan's Gundam Factory:",

In September of last year, unprecedented leaks gave fans a potential look at the sequel in over 90 videos showcasing secret in-development footage of the open-world crime sequel.  We also learned last year that the game reportedly stars a female protagonist. Bloomberg says this Grand Theft Auto V sequel is set in a fictional version of Miami and features the aforementioned female protagonist as well as a male protagonist. \n\n\nWhile waiting to learn more about Rockstar's next game, read Game Informer's Grand Theft Auto V review and then read our thoughts on Red Dead Redemption II.

We are proud to announce that a whole batch of HeR Interactive’s Nancy Drew games are now ready for public testing:\nIn Nancy Drew: Stay Tuned for Danger, a soap opera star needs your help in uncovering who is behind a series of death threats that sound a little too real for comfort. \nNancy Drew: Message in a Haunted Mansion has you helping out with repairs in a Victorian mansion. However, a series of strange accidents, plus some murmurings of a ghost haunting, quickly threaten to turn this renovation into an investigation.\nIn Nancy Drew: Treasure in the Royal Tower a failed ski vacation at an eccentric castle with even more eccentric inhabitants soon turns into a quest to uncover a lost piece of the history of the French Revolution.\nAnd if you’re looking for something more thrilling, in Nancy Drew: The Final Scene, you will find yourself racing against the clock to find your kidnapped friend, while also saving a historical theater with more than a fair share of secrets from demolition.\nThe games are available for purchase through HeR Interactive’s website or Steam (Stay Tuned for Danger is not available on Steam, however). Or if you already own a CD copy of the games, their English and Russian variants will also work. To play them with ScummVM, you will need a daily development build.

          "description": "We are very pleased to announce today the start of the testing period of two single-game engines: Kingdom: The Far Reaches and Escape From Hell!\nKingdom, was developed and released by Interplay in 1995. Only the DOS version of the game (available on gog.com) is supported. It's a cartoon FMV game, with an inventory, in which you have to guide Lathan Kandor through a medieval world, discovering the magic spells and the items required to defeat an evil wizard. \nEscape From Hell, was developed for Electronic Arts by the game veterans Richard Seaborne and Alan Murphy and was released in 1990. You play Alan in this keyboard-only Role Playing Game and visit Hell, looking for your girlfriend who was accidentally teleported there.\nBoth games use heavily hardcoded logic which is error prone and requires a lot of testing, so we need your feedback more than ever as they are both incompletely tested. There is sadly only one known demo for Kingdom. Support for the Windows and Mac versions of Kingdom may come later! Please contact us if you have some other demos of both games.\nTo play any of these games, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker and please take some screenshots along the way!\n>",
