          "description": "Assassin's Creed Shadows has a lot riding on it. Between its multiple release date delays in response to Star Wars Outlaws not selling as well as Ubisoft would've liked, and Ubi potentially being bought by Tencent as they clamour for help, there's a sense that Shadows needs to deliver not only a great game, but corporate redemption.\nI've now played Shadows for four hours, having dipped into a bit of prologue action, some open world exploration, and a questline as both the hulking Yasuke and the lithe Naoe. Have Ubi delivered? I think there's a strong chance. What I played was a lot of comforting Creeding, carried along by a gorgeous interpretation of Edo Japan, and some subtle tweaks to up stealth stakes. Although I do think the two protagonists are a split personality that doesn't quite work for me.\nRead more",

          "description": "Readers, I have spent two full days in the benchmark pits to tell you what you've already guessed: the GeForce RTX 5090 is very fast, too expensive, and laden with more AI tech than Philip K. Dick’s cheese dreams. At least two of those points will, I’m sure, send the average graphics card shopper running, especially at a time when even game developers are growing suspicious of generative AI and its many-thumbed, robot-voiced nostrums.\nYet while there’s not much to be done about the RTX 5090 costing at minimum £1939 / $1999, hundreds more than the infamously spenny RTX 4090, its suite of more purely performance-focused artificial intelligence tools is – dare I say it – quite neat. These range from Multi Frame Generation (MFG), which is basically DLSS 3 frame gen but up to twice as fast, to DLSS 4’s general upscaling enhancements and even the ability to apply newer DLSS versions to older games. All this will come to the rest of the RTX 50 series as well, with some trickling down to the enter RTX range, so maybe the RTX 5090 is best understood not as a practical GPU purchase in itself but as a Picadilly Square-filling advert for its more affordable siblings can do.\nRead more",

Eliot's The Love Song Of J. Alfred Prufrock. The poem meant enough to me that I didn't want to dissect it with a class. I wanted to keep for myself. I went in the end, and though I hesitated, I talked because I had things to say. It didn't kill the poem for me, but it does have a slightly awkward gait now, having never quite recovered from the incisions.\nI now have to etherise Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth. Cait Sith is splayed upon a table. It's all scalpels, forceps, and oversized novelty dice. It's a strange way to treat art you love. The feeling I remember most from Rebirth on release is how grateful I felt to be alive to play it. Acute, active awareness of my own mortality with thoughts like \"it would be properly shit if I died right now because I'd really like to see how this pans out\". A personal 'never kill yourself' moment months before the meme gave voice, as the best often do, to an obscure and precious feeling.\nAn RPG where your character sometimes knocks on doors before opening them?

Archetype Entertainment.\nSummerfall appear to be prospering, but many of the studios founded by former BioWare devs have experienced hard times.

This time, the culprit is Matthew Ball of analyst firm Epyllion, who remarks in a sprawling State Of Videogaming 2025 report that \"some gamemakers hope GTA 6 will be priced at $80-$100 [in the USA], breaking the $70 barrier and helping $50 titles to move up to $60, $60 to $70, $70 to $80, etc.\"\nPicked up by VGC, these comments have now been circulated on social media, and have attracted the extremely polarised mixture of responses you're probably expecting. Among those chipping in is Larian's director of publishing Michael Douse, who makes the familiar argument that overall prices for games like GTA aren't necessarily higher today when you factor in economic inflation, while also acknowledging that up-front price alone doesn't explain the industry's recent mass livelihood devastation, and that few people would happily pay that much for a video game - not even Our Lord In Open Worlding GTA.\n Read more",

Following the election, I've also noticed a couple of video game company executives express misgivings about DEI - misgivings that, amongst other things, illustrate that \"DEI\" has come to mean a lot more than just annual training about micro-aggressions.\n  \nRead more",

          "description": "\"Coming off Turbo Overkill has been great,\" Trigger Happy's Sam Prebble tells me over call. \"That game's development... I mean, it worked out. But it was very messy because it was my first game and I didn't know what the hell I was doing. So I found myself, when it came to pumping content out, I was like: oh, shit. This code base is fucking awful. Like, I can't put stuff together easily. I'm running into bugs everywhere. But now shit just works!\"\nYou might know Sam Prebble as Trigger Happy Interactive, the solo developer behind frenetic FPS Turbo Overkill. Before that he went by a different name, attached to a very different project. Total Chaos, first released in 2018 under the moniker Wadaholic, is a total conversion mod for Doom 2. With its focus on a thick survival horror atmosphere of tension and disempowerment, it's about as far removed from Turbo Overkill's manic, Doom Eternal-inspired action as a game can get. As Prebble puts it, the only thing the two projects have in common is the first person perspective. Even so, he found himself returning to Total Chaos after wrapping development on Turbo Overkill, resulting in the standalone remake. \nRead more",

          "description": "Like it or not, horror gaming is often built on jump scares. Deriding a good cheap scare ignores the endorphin rush that draws so many players to the genre, in the same way that the \"elevated horror\" trend forfeits some of the soul of schlocky slasher flicks and ghost movies. Don’t get me wrong, Silent Hill and Alan Wake deserve their flowers - but even those games would wither on the screen if Pyramid Head didn’t bust through a wall from time to time.\nOne unsung jump scare game in particular pioneered horror in the internet age, blazing everywhere from nascent social media to major television networks. In fact, if you had an internet connection circa 2005, there’s a good chance you played it. Alas, it was too ahead of its time, too successful at leveraging virality before viral horror was sought after. Next time you see a streamer throw their headphones across the room in fright, beware: the spirit of Scary Maze Game is right behind you.\nRead more",

The stringy orchestral music? The dramatic monologues? The horrible things happening to armoured grunts? This thing’s really playing the Polish fantasy hits.\nRead more",

I’m happy to discover this explanation, because at first I thought that “spance” was just a litigation-avoiding, supermarket rebrand of “space”. I was bracing to send the good news to developers Skyglow Softworks that, so far, nobody has managed to copyright “space”, though I’m sure somebody’s tried. Maybe, um, God? \r\n\n\r\nIt’s a relief to know that God won’t be suing Skyglow Softworks for breach of copyright, because off the back of two demo missions, Annihilate The Spance is worryingly compelling. It’s a mixture of space RTS and autobattler, wherein you construct bases that produce spanceships who autopilot towards the nearest and largest concentration of enemies. According to the developers, it’s inspired by the 2011 Flash game Obliterate Everything by CWWallis (RIP), which I dimly recall playing while I was running a browser game blog for AOL. Anyway, here’s a trailer.\r\n \nRead more",

There's a parallel story about your character and his role in a magical order of destiny godlings I didn't find the least bit interesting, but the rest is thrilling because Romance is already thrilling.

          "description": "Pure Rock Crawling is about steering off road vehicles across rocky terrain. It's about pumping the gas pedal and wrenching the steering wheel just so, such that you lurch forward and over the obstacles, rather than tumbling backwards. It's MudRunner without the mud, with a knockabout simplicity presumably as a result of its apparently one-man development team. It launched last October but I hadn't heard of it until today, when a new map was added, and now I want to play it.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I played it for three hours today and, among the many build challenges and adventures, a small story formed around a baby pig. We named him Porky, we caged him as our pet, and in an unfortunate accident, we watched as he fell to his death from the sky island that was our home. RPS in peace, Porky.\r\n\nHow many befriended pigs like Porky have there been across the last several hundred hours of play? I'm not sure - dozens, hundreds - but soon such pigs might have a new form. After 15 years, Mojang are adding new types of pig to Minecraft.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The feature is available now and included for GeForce NOW Ultimate, Performance, and Day Pass users.\n\n\nAccording to Nvidia, BG3 players on GeForce NOW can now make use of a wide array of customization options when it comes to mods, with more mod support on the way for both BG3 and various other PC games.\n\n\nThe process to download mods on GeForce NOW sounds incredibly streamlined. Players who launch the RPG on GeForce NOW can navigate an in-game mod menu to download and enable their desired mods. These selections will stay enabled across your GeForce NOW sessions, so you won't have to worry about reenabling them each time. You can also subscribe to specific mods via mod.io which will preload them the next time you launch Baldur's Gate 3 from GeForce NOW.\n\n\nAn interesting point of note is that the mod support is also included across all GeForce NOW supported devices including Nvidia Shield TVs, laptops, Macs, Chromebooks, and even handheld devices including the Steam Deck. This makes it one of the easiest ways to access BG3 mod support on a handheld, which is pretty nifty.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nNvidia also revealed seven new games being added to the service today including the newly released roguelike bullet hell survivor title Jotunnslayer: Hordes of Hel.

It was also announced that Doom: The Dark Ages has locked down a release date of May 15, 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\nDoom: The Dark Ages serves as a prequel to 2016's Doom and Doom Eternal, and tells the origin story of the Doom Slayer's rage. Set in medieval times, players jump into the role of the Doom Slayer, the ultimate super weapon of Gods and Kings to fight, tasked with fighting the forces of hell in a dark and sinister medieval war. Despite being a prequel, Doom: The Dark Ages will also be a perfect entry point for players new to the series.\n\n\nAccording to id Software, Doom: The Dark Ages will feature open-world areas and massive boss fights as players progress through the story while gaining access to a plethora of new badass devastating weapons like the Shield Saw which not only lets players block projectiles but gives them the opportunity to hurl it at enemies like a deadly boomerang and even pull of well-timed parries to devastate attacking demons.\n\n\nWe also got a look at two cool new tools of war against the forces of hell: the Mecha Dragon and a massive Atlan mech. The first is a fire-breathing beast that allows you to take to the skies and rain hellfire on flying demons and enemies below. The colossal Atlan mech is the side of a building and allows you to take on the largest titan demons in style. id Software also pointed out that both tools weren't gimmicky one-off additions to Doom: The Dark Ages, but rather full-fledged features that have their own extensive uses throughout.\n\n\nDoom: The Dark Ages is set to release on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5 on May 15, 2025.\n\nThe post Doom: The Dark Ages shows off brutal combat, sets release for May appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "I don’t know how to tell you this, but PureArts and Capcom have announced a three-foot tall bust of Nemesis from the Resident Evil 3 remake. You can pre-order it today. It’s only being produced in limited quantities, but, uh, I’m not sure what the market is like on this sort of thing.\n\n\nMaybe you don’t have my problem. I have too much video game paraphernalia. When I was younger, video game-related merch wasn’t nearly as common, but now it’s everywhere for everything. So, I don’t really know where I’d put something like this. Even if I did, it’s a very unique statement piece. Nemesis is grotesque. Just this big melty-dude staring at me from the corner while I’m drinking tea or something.\n\n\nHe’d maybe be good in the entryway. I could put my hats and scarves on him. Maybe him a little hug when I come home. Scare the couriers who make deliveries at my apartment. However, I wouldn’t spend $1899 for something like that. I’m not saying it’s not worth it. That’s an awful lot of resin. I just don’t think that much resin fits in with my budget.\n\n\nImage via PlayArts\n\n\nIt says how much it costs and that it’s 1/1 scale, but not how much it weighs. Is it hollow. The press release does note that it would pair well with the Lady Dimitrescu 1/4 Scale Statue. I don’t agree with that. Maybe if it was a 1/1 bust of Lady Dimitrescu, but I feel like a full statue would make poor Nemesis feel a bit jealous. When decorating, I feel a room must be dedicated to full figures or busts, but never mix both.\n\n\nAnyway, if you’re interested in this massive chunk-a-hunk, pre-orders are open today. It’s available worldwide, but I can’t imagine the shipping costs for something like that. The final product ships Q1 2026.\n\nThe post PureArts has a 3-foot Nemesis bust if you want something gross to put your hats on appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The iconic PPSh-41 has been a powerhouse in multiple Call of Duty entries, all spanning from the game's WWII era. Now, it'll make a new name for itself in Black Ops 6 and Warzone Season 2, expanding the ever-so-mobile SMG class. Here's how to unlock it. \n\n\nHow do you unlock the PPSh-41 in BO6 and Warzone Season 2?\n\n\nYou can unlock the PPSh-41 in the Season 2 Battle Pass on Page 6 as an HVT Tier Reward or from a Blueprint on Page 14. The new season arrives on Jan. 28, 2025, so you must wait until then. Once it drops, you'll likely have the choice of getting it for free with enough XP or through a premium purchase for those who want to get it instantly.\n\n\nTo get the PPSh-41 for free, you can start farming for XP by simply playing the game. Using tokens is always a good way to go, and there may be another Double XP Weekend event that could help you out even more. Plus, you can rely on Daily Challenges to get around 2,500 to 5,000 XP.\n\n\nImage via Activision\n\n\nLike many SMGs, PPSh-41 thrives in close-range combat, excelling in rapid-fire and damage rates. However, you may want to tweak its build to improve recoil control and handling. SMGs are known to have issues with these two stats, but thankfully, a quick change to attachments can be highly beneficial.\n\n\nEquip any muzzle to the PPSh-41 to help with recoil control, and attach a stock to get a better grip on handling. You can also equip an extended magazine to compensate for this SMG's relatively low 32-mag size. The rest of the build depends on your preference, whether with optics or barrels to increase damage.\n\n\nThe more you play around with the PPSh-41, the more likely you'll earn unique camos for this build. Use the new Challenge Tracking system to keep track of your progress, earning you designs for BO6 Multiplayer, Zombies, and Warzone. The PPSh-41 is excellent for BO6 Zombies, in particular, as it's been widely used in several undead iterations.\n\nThe post How to unlock PPSh-41 in Black Ops 6 and Warzone Season 2 appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's super cheap as the ingredient itself is 2 Star Coins, while the seeds are 1 Star Coin. Both may be available at the stall. The seeds grow within a minute after getting planted and watered.\n\n\nEggs can be purchased at Chez Remy for 220 Star Coins after finishing the Ratatouille realm quests in the castle.\n\n\nVanilla is found within the Sunlit Plateau. Look at the ground, and you'll find a green plant with small yellow/white petals growing from within the grass. Pick it up, and you'll gain Vanilla for the recipe. \n\n\nSugarcane is found at Goofy's Stall in Dazzle Beach. You can buy its seeds for 5 Star Coins each. You can also make Cheesecake with this ingredient.\n\n\nLastly, Ginger can be found growing in the Forgotten Lands. This ingredient can be picked up like Vanilla. The green plant with regular, slightly lengthier leaves on it gives you Ginger. \n\n\nNow it's time to make the 5-star dish\n\n\nOnce you have all of the ingredients, go to any cooking station at your house or in Chez Remy. Throw in all five ingredients together, and then you'll have a Gingerbread House in your inventory. You can sell it to Goofy's Stall for 545 Star Coins or eat it for 1,460 Energy points. \n\nThe post How to make a Gingerbread House in Disney Dreamlight Valley appeared first on Destructoid.",

So if we rule out an appreciation of 1997 web design, what fuels pirate sites' enduring love affair with .to?\nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",

Mělo to mít nějakou jinou \"message\" než \"když jsi psychopatický gangster, špatně dopadneš\"? Ale docela to uteklo. Jednoznačné mínus a nechtěný (zřejmě?) humor tkví ve skutečnosti, že hlavní hrdinka (t.j. žena) pořád vypadá jako nabušený chlap v paruce a během celého filmu to žádné jiné postavě nepřijde divné.

Hudebně vychází z původní lidové písně a již dávno zažité sestupné basové linky původně inspirované čardášem. V monumentální instrumentaci zaznívá důstojné a bohaté \"hradní\" Maestoso s výraznou smyčcovou figurací a dramatické Presto s vypjatým protihlasem tak kontrastně jako dunajské nížiny a Vysoké Tatry. Důvodem vzniku bylo hledání krásy a síly slovenské hudby s duchovním nadhledem mně tolik blízké mahlerovské angažovanosti. Velmi důležitá při tom pro mě byla noblesa a hudební kultivovanost při zachování původní písně. Nový rozměr je u mě h…",
