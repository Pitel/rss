Back in those terrible and endlessly cruel times we didn't have all your fancy CGI smothering the life out of every frame, you see, or superheroes like...er...any of those weird Chris guys to entertain us. No, instead we had to make do with amazing practical effects that added texture and believability to everything, and comedic geniuses like Rick Moranis in lead roles so we were guaranteed a certain level of fun.\nYes, for us old fogies, the reveal trailer drop for Obsidian's Grounded was a very exciting time indeed. Heart monitors were double-checked and pants were quickly changed as we were shown what looked to be a Honey I Shrunk The Kids simulator disguised as a very cool survival game. And really, having spent hours playing the Xbox version over the past year or so, we can confirm that's exactly what you've got here — an incredibly immersive and atmospheric game that drops you (and up to three pals in online co-op) into a backyard full of secrets, stories, and great big bleddy spiders.

          "description": "The wait is over.\nThe PS1 played host to a staggering number of memorable and influential RPGs, one of which was Konami’s Suikoden. After that strong debut came a handful of sequels that eventually puttered out during the sixth generation of consoles, and Konami has virtually abandoned the series since. Not ones to be stifled, some key members of the Suikoden crew eventually left Konami and founded a new team called Rabbit & Bear, which started a successful crowdfunding campaign for this spiritual successor called Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes. After a four-year development cycle, Eiyuden Chronicle is finally in our hands and while it has its share of issues, this is overall a deeply enjoyable and nostalgic JRPG that we’re sure is going to get a lot of love.\nThe story is set in the fictional land of Allraan and begins by focusing on the rising tensions between the powerful imperial country of Galdea and a neighboring province called the League of Nations. Though there are technically three protagonists to this narrative, your main character to begin with is Nowa, a chipper young man from a quiet border village who joins a small peacekeeping military unit for the League of Nations. Nowa and his band go about their business quelling bandit raids and helping people to the best of their ability, but soon find themselves caught in the middle of much larger political tension that eventually gives way to war between the Empire and the League. To reclaim his homeland and avenge his losses, Nowa thus sets out to build a resistance and defeat the Galdeans.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

I like horror that has a generally spooky, creeping dread vibe rather than being wall-to-wall cheap jumpscares and gore, and that sort of stuff is thin on the ground. But it'll be less so from May the 15th, cos that's when this ghosty point and click puzzle adventure is out! Hooray! The demo is still on Steam if you want a taste before then. In the meantime, the release date announcement comes with a new trailer to enjoy.\nRead more",

I really liked a lot about Tales Of Kenzera, and got annoyed by a bunch of stuff too - and the division seems to be that a lot of the former falls on the story and design side, and the latter on the mechanical side, which I guess isn't ideal for a platformer.

This, I believe, should be enough to tempt you into dunking it enthusiastically into your next break coffee, but if you need more convincing, let’s do it.\nCreated by E.H Jørgensen, whose credits include Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak, Rising Up is a relatively simple 3 button side scroller that has you make your way up an office building, destroying everything in your path. First, irate co-workers wield swivel chairs. Then, security join the fray. Then some sort of G-men get involved. You can punch, block, jump, and air-kick. The brawling is simple but satisfying enough, and the way office equipment violently degrades when hit is better, but this isn’t why I’m recommending the game.\n \nRead more",

This is not much fun, though it's a great opportunity to meet and bond with other would-be tenants over a shared, grinding resentment of landlords who will literally stuff a bed in a toilet and call it a \"studio apartment\". It's also left me powerfully invested in the premise of Blue Prince, a first-person puzzler which looks like a graphic novel and starts with your character inheriting a huge, weird, isolated mansion, Mt. Holly, from an eccentric great-uncle. \r\n\n\r\nLucky you! There's a catch, though: according to your great-uncle's will, you only get to keep the place if you can find its 46th room. The catch hanging off that catch is that going by its flatplan, the mansion only has 45 rooms. And the catch hanging off that catch is that the mansion changes shape between visits. Every time you open one of its many doors, you must choose from three cards to decide which room is on the other side. To find the elusive 46th room, you must \"draft\" rooms in certain combinations to unfold the mystery of the place and wiggle your way to its heart.\r\n \nRead more",

And yes, some of it is annoying and obtuse and will almost certainly suit veterans who enjoy those quirks, but it has a surprisingly easy going nature.

The key addition this time is more new layouts that will appear after you reach the bottom of the mines, and more layouts for the volcano mines too. If you've not played Stardew Valley you might wonder why there are deep mines and volcanos, and to you I say \"Pah! You should play Stardew Valley.\"\n1.6.4 also has a lot of bug fixes (including fixing disappearing pets, new pets being a key feature of 1.6) and some balance changes, as well as a host of fixes for modders and modded players. ConcernedApe said early on that 1.6 would be an update for modders, so it's nice to see that being supported. You can read the full patch notes here.\nRead more",

It's the work of 250 people, with Jan Valta returning as composer.

Nancy is hired to find said heirloom, and interview a bunch of suspects, one of whom is creepy puppet guy up there (there are no screens of Nancy because she never actually steps out from behind the camera in these games; she may as well be a cryptid).

There are also unicorns, crystal skulls and robot parts. Slightly confused by the unicorns, crystal skulls and robot parts, if I'm honest.

          "description": "The surreal pop synth of Sayonara Wild Hearts may have been the game that put Swedish developer Simogo on the map for PC players, but for me their earlier iOS puzzler Device 6 stands in my memory as being one of the most distinctive video games I've played. An interactive mystery novel at its heart, Device 6 took full advantage of its mobile-based hardware, asking players to turn and rotate their device to read certain lines of text, and scroll through its chapters searching for audio visual clues to solve its puzzles. I've often lamented that it never made its way to other platforms, even though part of its magic is inherently tied to physicality of its tactile origins.\nHappily, after playing a few hours of Simogo's latest game, Lorelei And The Laser Eyes it's clear this equally classy detective story shares much of the same DNA as Device 6. It has the same love of riddles and mysterious, cryptic puzzles, only now they're writ large in a fully explorable 3D setting - a monochrome and maze-like hotel belonging to a reclusive artist. But Simogo's love of text hasn't been diminished in the process. Early on you find an instruction manual for Lorelei And The Laser Eyes within the game itself, which straight away tells you to have a pen and paper nearby to help solve its numerous conundrums. Heck, publishers Annapurna Interactive even sent me a full-blown notebook in the post just to hammer it home. They're not kidding, either. Even the opening section of the game had me scribbling down names, sums and symbols, much like Tunic, Return Of The Obra Dinn and Outer Wilds did before it. Which is just as well, really, as I'll definitely be needing some reminders when I come to play the full version on May 16th.\nRead more",

That date is August 8th, by the way, and the answer is: yes it is! Though it was revealed at Nintendo's Indie World Showcase earlier this afternoon, strategy action-adventure-with-robots sequel SteamWorld Heist 2 isn't a timed platform exclusive, so that's fun!\nSteamWorld Heist 2 is, if you hadn't guessed, a sequel to SteamWorld Heist, which came to PC in 2016. The first was a side-on tactics game where you, leading a team of robots, shot teams of other (bad) robots in turn-based skill-heavy tactical battles. While that all took place in space, the sequel has achieved splashdown, and you'll be chuntering about the seas with a new lead character (Captain Leeway) and a new bunch of crewmates.

          "description": "Years before she worked on top-drawer point-and-clickers Return To Monkey Island and Thimbleweed Park, Australian game developer Jenn Sandercock was a junior designer on Team Bondi's historical open world game L.A. Noire. Eventually published by Grand Theft Auto developers Rockstar in 2011, L.A. Noire took seven years to make and is an especially notorious example of crunch culture and mismanagement. Sandercock joined in the middle of one such crunch period, and wanted to make life a little easier for her exhausted colleagues. \"Everyone looked so miserable after literally years of hard work & crunch,\" she wrote on Twitter in 2018. \"So late one night after work I baked 2 cakes for the office. I sent out a mass email & we all took 30 minutes to eat cake and talk.\" Sandercock began hosting weekly \"Cake Days\", baking a fresh batch in her own time to share around the office.\r\n\n\r\nRockstar were unimpressed, however. They thought Cake Day was evidence of poor productivity and, according to Sandercock, badgered Team Bondi leadership into forcing her to only share cake during official lunch hours. \"Apparently the higher ups thought our entire office slacked off ALL the time because we had cake once a week,\" Sandercock wrote. She herself was told \"that I was jeopardising my career\". Sandercock hasn't let the demise of Cake Day cramp her creative interest in food, however. In fact, she's found a way to combine baking with game design. Sandercock is now the author of Edible Games, a book of recipes and instructions for concocting games out of food, and food out of games.\r\n \nRead more",

Do these brazen publishers and developers not know that this, the year 2024, is the Year of Shadow the Hedgehog?\nSega said as much only a few days ago. They've announced a series of fan celebrations for Sonic Adventure 2's Ultimate Lifeform, beginning in the traditional style with a Shadow-themed MotoGP bike and an associated LEGO tie-in. And now, the earth quakes underfoot as we learn via The Hollywood Reporter that Keanu Reeves, forgotten star of 90s romantic drama A Walk in the Clouds and also those recent John Wick films, will play Shadow in the forthcoming movie adaptation Sonic 3.\n Read more",

Just as it’s smooth low-end performer on desktops, Manor Lords can easily keep its head above 30fps in handheld mode, and that’s usually more like 40-45fps with the right visual settings.\nStill, there’s scope for it to become a much more Deck-friendly game, if not by its April 26th release date then hopefully at least during its early access phase. Faster performance would be nice, sure, but what this citybuilder-meets-RTS-battler really needs for optimal portability is a more refined set of controls.\nRead more",

However. Eagle-eyed viewers of the Fallout show noted that episode 6 gives you a number for Valt-Tec that you can actually get in touch with - 213-25-VAULT (or, 213-258-2858). Charges apply, as well as international codes if you're outside the US, which makes it 001-213-258-2858. \nIf you text the number you get a reply from Vault-Tec saying \"The next available appointment is 33 weeks from now, please stand by!\" (handily captured by X user FanaticalGuy cos my response hasn't come through yet). And then the significantly less immersive \"Reply Y to get recurring marketing and other texts from FallOut\", which is quite funny. There is speculation that this is just a reference to Vault 33, the vault where main character Lucy was born and raised. On the other hand, 33 weeks from now is November, the month when both Fallout 4 and Fallout 76 came out.\nRead more",

Not my cup of tea, but have a go of the demo. But you know what got me to play an action platformer roguelite when those games aren't really my cup of tea? That godamn name is what!\nRead more",

          "description": "Poslední měsíc byl plný zajímavých akcí, o kterých Vám bastlíři z projektu MacGyver mohou povědět, protože se na ně sami vydali. Kde všude byli, ptáte se? Objevili se na Installfestu, Arduino Day, Hackaday Europe a tajném srazu bastlířů z Twitteru. A z každé akce pro vás mají zajímavé poznatky.\r\n\r\nKromě reportáží a zážitků mají samozřejmě i jiné novinky - Průša pracuje na skříni pro XL, která bude mít i měření teploty, řízený odtah a filtry. Na trhu se objevil zajímavý osciloskop, který obsahuje i zdroj, multimetr, generátor, spektrální analyzátor a uvnitř zabudovaný interpreter MicroPythonu. A ST zavádí nové technologie u svých procesorů.\r\n\r\nZe světa hardwaru můžou zmínit nové výkonné desky s podporou pro Arduino včetně PLC od Finderu. Také se objevila spousta zajímavé literatury pro milovníky precizní techniky. Poreferovat se dá i o věcech, co nově vyzkoušeli - kupříkladu levnou (ale přesto funkční a pohodlnou) pájecí pinzetu, jak se dělají teardrops v KiCADu 8 nebo jak na IBIS modely zdarma.\r\n\r\nPokud jde o software či jeho kombinaci s hardwarem, třeba dojde řeč na zranitelnost zámků Saflok, backdoor v XZ utils, dokumentační nástroj pro kabeláž nebo ST-Link s integrovaným power profilerem.\r\n\r\nSamozřejmě svoje místo budou mít i bizarní témata, třeba jak změna časového pásma způsobí, že eDoklady budou tvrdit, že jste se narodili v jiný den. Kanada se snaží bojovat s větrnými mlýny zákazem Flipper Zero, IRC klient přímo v UEFI, jak umístit video do QR kódu nebo proč vznikla panika z UV světla vycházejícího z RGB LED.\r\n\r\nPříští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat v pondělí 22. dubna od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.",

It’s supposedly a rare hybrid trout, and according to the game, it can’t bear offspring. It can, however, be caught, and here’s how.\n\n\nTiger trout are river fish, which means you need to catch them in flowing water, like the stream that flows through Pelican Town and Cindersap Forest. It can also be caught within the Meadowlands, Forest, Riverlands, and Hill-Top farms. \n\n\nHowever, the only seasons you can catch tiger trout are Fall and Winter. As always, if you need to catch one out of season, you can try your luck by using Magic Bait.\n\n\nAside from catching them, you can very rarely find them in Krobus’ shop in the sewers for 200G on Wednesdays, or at the traveling cart for 450-1000G.\n\n\nOnce caught, a tiger fish can be used to make sashimi. You can also use them as an ingredient for Maki Rolls or Quality Fertilizer.

The following phase prompts the arrival of a new but familiar face and continues the Jafar storyline. Here's when to expect the next Disney Dreamlight Valley update and what will be included. \n\n\nWhen does Disney Dreamlight Valley A Rift in Time Act 2 release?\n\n\nThe next Disney Dreamlight Valley update has yet to receive an official release date. However, a new teaser indicates it will be \"coming soon.\" An upcoming first look is expected on April 24, 2024, hopefully providing a launch date. \n\n\n\n\nSince the Spark of Imagination Act 2 was slated for a Spring 2024 release on the roadmap, the next DDV update could arrive in late April or May. Based on the teaser, players will venture deeper into Eternity Isle, continuing the saga from Act 1. Things were relatively left off with a cliffhanger, as Jafar causes more mischief through the mysterious time powers. \n\n\nGaston, Rapunzel, and EVE are the first among the group to help with Eternity Isle's many problems (well, Gaston helps in his own way). In Disney Dreamlight Valley's next update, a new character will join the team with the arrival of Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. Oswald will likely play a vital role through new missions and character-related quests. \n\n\nYou must purchase the expansion pass to access a Rift in Time's Act 1 and upcoming Act 2 (Act 3 for Summer release). The pack can be bought separately or as a bundle with the Gold Edition. However, if you only seek out the base game features, the following update offers free content, including new items and general improvements. \n\n\nImage via Gameloft\n\n\nWe also got a sneak peek into the next Star Path, featuring an adorable Peppy Popcorn Squirrel. More exclusive content will be revealed for the Rift in Time's first look on April 24, so make sure to mark your calendars and stay tuned for more details. \n\nThe post When is the next Disney Dreamlight Valley update? appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Call of Duty's Double XP events are tremendous opportunities for players to rise up the ranks. These exclusive weekends often correlate with the latest celebrations or holiday-themed extravaganzas. So, if you want to be prepared, here's when to expect the next Warzone and MW3 Double XP event. \n\n\nWarzone and MW3 Double XP event release date\n\n\nThere aren't any confirmed details on the next Call of Duty Double XP event, but it may debut for Season 3 Reloaded. That means it could occur at the beginning of May. A previous Double XP event recently took off on April 19, 2024, but that has since concluded. \n\n\nDuring an active Double XP event, your Operators can earn substantial experience in MW3 Multiplayer, Zombies, and Warzone. This is your chance to make significant strides in your game, so don't miss out. You can also take on the various weekly challenges to get more bang for your buck.\n\n\nIf you miss the duration, don't fret; there will surely be more Double XP-related celebrations to come. Sometimes, they occur during MW3's free trial period or even on a random Thursday. \n\n\nIn addition to these events, you can use XP Tokens, a reward obtained from log-ins and challenges. They won't last as long as the Double XP celebrations, though, since they generally range from 15 minutes to an hour.\n\n\nImage by Destructoid\n\n\nThose looking for more XP opportunities can follow the Call of Duty page to keep up-to-date.

          "description": "Duck feathers have multiple uses in Stardew Valley, from being a great gift for certain villagers to a solid money-making option. However, while it may sound like they're easy to find, you'll need to put some time and effort into finding one. Here's how to get duck feathers in Stardew Valley.\n\n\nWhere to get Duck Feather in Stardew Valley\n\n\nThe main way to get duck feathers is through random chance from ducks. By building a big coop and purchasing ducks from Marnie's Ranch for 1,200 gold, you'll get eggs and feathers from these little creatures over time. However, feathers are rarer than eggs and require you to raise your friendships with the ducks first before getting one.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nAlternatively, you can marry Emily for a duck feather. Although she won't give you one immediately, you can get various tailor-related items, including duck feathers. You can also get cloth and wool, which are useful for selling or making clothes.\n\n\nWhat are Duck Feathers used for?\n\n\nIn Stardew Valley, duck feathers have three main uses:\n\n\n\nGifting to Elliott and Leo.\n\n\nUsing in the Bulletin Board's Dye Bundle.\n\n\nSelling for between 250-600 gold.\n\n\n\nHow you use duck feathers depends entirely on whether you plan to make money, complete the community center, or befriend some villagers. If you want to romance Elliott or befriend Leo, you can gift them a duck feather as a loved gift. Likewise, you need one for the community center, so having one will help you there.\n\n\nLastly, you can sell duck feathers for anywhere between 250 to 600 gold. A regular feather without the Rancher profession perk can fetch you 250 coins for your troubles while loving your ducks to the point of maxing out their hearts can give you Iridium-quality feathers worth 500 gold with no trait and 600 with Rancher. While not much individually, collecting a bunch can make you plenty of money over time. \n\nThe post How to get and use Duck Feather in Stardew Valley appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Strange Scaffold’s 2023 hit El Paso, Elsewhere is the next indie game in line to have it narrative transferred to the big screen. According to Deadline, LaKeith Stanfield is being tapped for the role of protagonist James Savage. Di Bonaventura Pictures and Colin Stark are set to produce.\n\n\nEl Paso, Elsewhere was one of my favorite games of 2023, and that was almost entirely because of its narrative. While its gameplay was a neo-noir shooter in the style of Max Payne, the story is of a demon hunter trying to stop his abusive vampire ex-girlfriend from ending the world. While the concept may sound otherworldly on the surface, it delves with meticulous detail into emotional abuse and its effects on the victim.\n\n\nI’m not at all sure how well that will translate to film as it’s entirely set within an abstract, ethereal world hidden beneath a motel. The characters only interact with each other during vignettes where James descends the floors in a hostile elevator. It lends well to the cutscene-level-cutscene flow of a video game, but for a compelling to watch experience, this will need to be extrapolated on. Thankfully, there's a lot of backstory and worldbuilding around the core game.\n\n\nWhile the game’s developer, Xalavier Nelson Jr., has acknowledged the movie, it hasn’t yet been stated if he will be involved in the creation process.\n\n\nIt’s a weird time we’re living in where game-to-TV adaptations like Castlevania and Fallout are finding praise and niche titles like El Paso, Elsewhere and Iron Lung are being adapted to film. I still prefer playing games to watching absolutely anything, but I never thought I’d see the day where justice was being done to the medium.\n\n\nThere’s no set timeline for when we might see the El Paso, Elsewhere film.\n\nThe post Vampire trauma tale El Paso, Elsewhere is getting a film adaptation appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Vortex Vi.Rus mainframe is the next event in Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone. Here is everything we know about the upcoming new challenges, including reward predictions. \n\n\nMW3 and Warzone Season 3 is well underway. The devs have already treated fans to a Gozilla x Kong crossover event and High Trip to celebrate 4/20. We still have some time before the mid-season update goes live, so Vortex: Virus Mainframe will help bridge that gap. \n\n\nMW3 & Warzone Vortex: Virus Mainframe event start date\n\n\n\n\n\nVortex Virus Mainframe begins on Wednesday, April 24, 2024, at 9 AM PT / 12 PM ET / 5 PM BST\n\n\nIf players haven't unlocked all of the free rewards for Blaze Up, you only have a few days left, as the event also ends on this date. And for everyone who has enjoyed the High Trip Resurgence game mode, that mode will also be removed once Vortex Virus Mainframe starts. \n\n\n It hasn’t been confirmed how long the latest Vortex event will last, but given that the Season 3 mid-season update is scheduled to start on May 1, Vortex Virus Mainframe will most likely be around for one week. \n\n\nMW3 & Warzone Vortex: Virus Mainframe reward predictions \n\n\nLike other events in the past, Vortex: Virus Mainframe rewards are earned by accumulating XP. The fastest way to earn XP is through using double XP tokens, playing Warzone, or jumping into small-map playlists in multiplayer that are relatively easy to get kills in. And, if you want to speed up the grind, a bonus 1000 XP will also be awarded for each match completed with the Bacillus skin equipped, which can only be obtained by purchasing the Vi.Rus Ultra Skin Tracer Pack.\n\n\nActivision has yet to reveal the official rewards, but we expect it to resemble previous challenges. With that in mind, here is the likely list of prizes.  \n\n\n\nCalling Cards\n\n\nEmblems\n\n\nWeapon Stickers\n\n\nLarge Decals\n\n\nWeapon Charms\n\n\nDouble XP Tokens\n\n\nThe post MW3 and Warzone Vortex Virus Mainframe event rewards and start date appeared first on Destructoid.",

This includes a set of artist-specific rotating songs players can compete for high scores in, as well as unlockable skins, songs, instruments, and other cosmetics, though unlocking all of these requires the purchase of the pricey 1,800 V-Buck Festival Pass. Previous headliners were The Weeknd and Lady Gaga.\nEilish recently made headlines for winning a Grammy, Golden Globe, and Oscar for \"What Was I Made For\" from the Barbie movie, which is a task she's now accomplished twice. Even more recently, she announced her upcoming album Hit Me Hard And Soft, which is likely her main marketing incentive for appearing in the game.

          "description": "After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.\nJoin Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

Although this technically isn’t an official announcement either, I'd say there's roughly a 99.99 percent chance that Black is involved.\nThe Minecraft movie, which has been in development in some form or another since 2014, is directed by Nacho Libre director Jared Hess. The cast includes Jason Momoa (Aquaman, Game of Thrones), Danielle Brooks (The Color Purple), Jennifer Coolidge (The White Lotus, American Pie), and Emma Myers (Wednesday). Minecraft is scheduled to hit theaters on April 4, 2025. \nJack Black is obviously no stranger to video game movies. He voiced Bowser in The Super Mario Bros.

This can include indie titles (the last one had a trailer for Another Crab's Treasure, for example) but also includes larger developers, like Sega or Atlus.\nIf that's confusing, you can get a sense of the games that have been showcased in this type of presentation in the past by visiting the official Indie World site. Fans will most likely be clamoring for a trailer or release date for Hollow Knight: Silksong, the sequel to the 2017 bug-themed Metroidvania. But while it's (hopefully) right around the corner, there's no specific reason to believe it will appear at this event other than the fact that it's an indie game coming to the Switch.\nWe won't know until the Indie World Showcase properly airs tomorrow. When it does, you can watch it right here.",

          "description": "Keanu Reeves is joining the cast of Sonic the Hedgehog 3, according to a report by The Hollywood Reporter (and first broken by The John Campea Show). The outlet’s sources report that the John Wick and Matrix star is voicing Shadow the Hedgehog.\nSonic the Hedgehog 3 is set to premiere on December 20 and will pit Shadow alongside a returning Dr. Robotnik (played by Jim Carrey) against Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles. The returning cast includes Ben Schwartz, Idris Elba, James Marsden, and Colleen O'Shaughnessey. The film's first trailer premiered in front of a select audience at Cinemacon in Las Vegas last week and it provided the first real look at Shadow. Unfortunately, the trailer has yet to be publically released. \nParamount has yet to officially confirm Reeves' casting, but if this is true, he will join fellow new cast members, including Krysten Ritter, Alyla Browne, James Wolk, Sofia Pernas, Cristo Fernández, and Jorma Taccone. Shadow's debut was teased at the end of Sonic the Hedgehog 2, but his voice performer has been a tantalizing mystery since the third film was announced in August 2022. \nMeanwhile, the standalone Knuckles series premieres on Paramount Plus on April 26. You can watch the first full-length trailer for that here.\n[Source: The Hollywood Reporter]",

As such, Square Enix has released a new benchmark software to let PC players test how well their machines will handle these new bells and whistles while getting a small head start on Dawntrail.\nAvailable as a free download for Windows, the benchmark software uses playable characters and actual maps to assign a performance score to your PC. This will provide a peek at the new graphical update, which spruces up the game with enhanced textures, shadows, material qualities, and other elements. You can download the benchmark here. \nThe benchmark includes a character creator for players to craft a fresh hero ahead of Dawntrail’s launch. It also includes access to the new female Hrothgar race. Existing characters can also be imported into the benchmark, and the appearance data from these characters can be imported into the full release of Dawntrail on Windows. \nFinal Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail launches on July 2. You can learn more about the expansion here. The game currently has a crossover event with Final Fantasy XVI that runs until May 8",

          "description": "Despite currently being in the midst of a crossover event with Avatar: The Last Airbender, Fortnite is teasing an upcoming event with a returning collaborator: Star Wars. The details have yet to be disclosed, but attentive fans of the science fiction juggernaut will notice something about the start date right away. The event is set to take place on Friday, May 3. The following day, May 4th, is known to many as Star Wars Day.\nWe have a good feeling about this...Star Wars is returning to #Fortnite. pic.twitter.com/6MCkDkolNb\nApril 15, 2024\nThe most newsworthy piece of info here, however, is the fact that the teaser indicates collaborations across several of Fortnite's new modes. This includes the classic battle Royale mode, the survival/crafting Lego mode, and the rhythm Festival mode, though Rocket Racing was notably excluded. Crossovers between Fortnite and other IPs usually just include cosmetic bundles, but this seems to imply that it will provide content for three different areas of the game.\nThe current Elements event pass technically includes a Lego variant skin as well as a guitar for Festival mode, so this Star Wars event could be as simple as that, but it's not unreasonable to speculate that Star Wars is a big enough property to warrant a larger scale crossover event. That said, this is just speculation.\nPrevious Star Wars crossovers included a Darth Vader boss battle, lightsabers, blasters, and force abilities, as well as a huge roster of skins spanning the movies and shows. Most recently, Ahsoka joined the fray as a part of the Chapter 4 Season 4 battle pass. \nIf you're interested in more Star Wars video games, you're in luck – we just launched our latest cover story, which features an exclusive look at Star Wars Outlaws. We've also got a hands-on preview, a video interview with the developers, and an entire hub devoted to this month's coverage of the game.\nWhat are you hoping to see from the upcoming Fortnite x Star Wars crossover?

However, this isn’t an official revival but rather due to the work of a dedicated group of fans.\nLawBreakers was created by Boss Key Productions, a team led by Gears of War lead designer Cliff Bleszinski. Upon launching for PlayStation 4 and PC in August 2017, it garnered a generally positive critical impression (read our review here). However, it failed to find its place in the competitive multiplayer shooter market of the time, resulting in poor sales and low player engagement that eventually led to its early demise in September 2018. \nNow, a team of passionate fans has worked to bring LawBreakers back. Dubbed The RELB Project, the project has been in the works since at least 2020. Its FAQ states that “This is a project to bring back the game LawBreakers, it's done by creating 'fake' servers that the original game client uses. You can join by downloading the launcher, patching your game and playing like normal.”\nRELB’s website allows you to download the launcher. Despite this revival being an unofficial project, Cliff Bleszinki (who has been vocal about wanting to see LawBreakers come back) has given it his blessing and enthusiastically shared RELB’s Discord on Saturday. \nSomehow LawBreakers is coming back, see below!!!\nhttps://t.co/1COV57FZQ5\nApril 13, 2024\nThe RELB Project is still very much a work in progress, but the team held its first series of public playtests this past weekend. Although several modes and features from the game were disabled, these sessions appear to have been largely successful. The next playtest has not been scheduled, and the team is currently seeking more developers.\nWhat did you think of LawBreakers and are you excited to see it playable again?

          "description": "The rogue-lite and roguelike genres have been growing in popularity over the years They’re challenging games where players attempt runs with different abilities and random elements that generally force the player to restart from zero or near-zero for each attempt. They are born from the 1980 game Rogue which established many of the mechanics now considered staples of the genre.\nBut the difference between rogue-lite and -like has always been confusing, so we asked an expert from Evil Empire, the co-developer of Dead Cells, to explain it to us. Lucie Dewagnier is the game director of the upcoming The Rogue: Prince of Persia (a rogue-lite) and defines the subgenres like this.\n“Roguelike is – like the game Rogue – a game where you play, you die, you hit replay, but nothing is kept between your attempts. You will always replay the game from a blank slate. \nRogue-lite may add some things like permanent upgrades and enhancements that make your future runs – your future tries – easier and has progression systems that do not exist in roguelikes.”\nMy hope, and I presented this plan to Dewagnier, is we drop the -lite and -like suffixes from the genre name and just refer to all games as existing within the Rogue genre. Dead Cells, Hades, Undermine, Returnal, etc. are no longer variations of rogue-lites and roguelikes – they’re all Rogue games.\n“Yeah, even now there are games like Spelunky that are part of Rogulikes, but they have progression systems with new content you can get, so maybe it’s rogue-lite? Maybe it’s Roguelike? They’re Rogues.”\nTo read more about Evil Empire and Dewagnier’s next game, The Rogue: Prince of Persia (which is a rogue-lite, “With a ‘T’,” Dewagnier says), head here.",

This newest set, Temporal Forces, continues the Ancient and Future conventions introduced in Paradox Rift, giving players new strategies featuring a variety of easily playable Basic Pokémon. \nThe Pokémon Company sent along a bunch of booster packs for us to open to see what we could pull. The set is one of the smaller recent expansions, but still large by the long-established standard of Pokémon TCG. Players picking up Temporal Forces can expect to pull from a pool of more than 160 cards. In addition to the additional Ancient and Future Pokémon, Temporal Forces reintroduces Ace Spec cards, first implemented during the Black & White series of cards. Those Ace Spec cards were some of the more unique cards I pulled, but the full-art Pokémon and ex cards most wowed me; I particularly love the Arbok and Minccio full-arts I grabbed. \nCheck out my favorites I pulled from Pokémon Trading Card Game's Scarlet & Violet – Temporal Forces expansion below!\n\n Pokémon Trading Card Game: Scarlet & Violet – Temporal Forces is available now. For more Pokémon TCG content, including galleries of past expansions, interviews, and the latest news, visit our hub by clicking the banner below.",

Sporting an eye-popping art direction that blends anime and graffiti art influences, this promising-looking action platformer is coming this year.\nRKGK (pronounced “Rakugaki”) unfolds in a Cap City, a futuristic metropolis caught in a vice grip by the oppressive B Corp led by the villainous Mr. Buff. The plot centers on rebellious graffiti artist Valah, who rages against this machine by using her art to bring life back to the city and inspire its citizens to stand up and rebel.\n\n\nValah gets around by using her graffiti paint to stylishly grind on rails while chaining jumps, dashes, and glides. She also has appears to have her own drone to soar across the cityscape. High-speed platforming is the name of the game, and maintaining a smooth flow state sends her into Defacer mode, transforming the world into a dreamy animated version of itself. Although the trailer doesn’t show off gameplay, it depicts Valah spraying paint to destroy B Corps’ robotic minions. You’ll also be able to create graffiti art using an array of paint and cosmetic tools.

And it's something you simply have to see, whether you're interested in first-person exploration games or not, because it's a sight to behold. \nAs someone who cannot draw, I'm always fascinated (and impressed) with people who can. That Jong was able to create an entire game using 10,000 drawings is all the more fascinating, and if the trailer below is any indication, it's a game I can't wait to check out. \nWatch the Sketchy Fables gameplay trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nThere's not much more information to find about the game. Its Steam description reads, \"Sketchy Fables is a first-person exploration adventure.\" Diving into the details of the Steam listing, Jong says it plays like an interactive cartoon and features a diverse game environment to explore full of villages and rural landscapes. \nIt's also \"focused on personal exploration with many random encounters and discoveries,\" according to the page. \n\nAs for when Sketchy Fables hits PC, that remains unknown, but it's a game we're keeping our eyes on so hopefully we'll have more to share sooner than later. \nDo you want to check out Sketchy Fables?

Revealed with a gameplay trailer during today's Triple-i Initiative Showcase, Kill Knight plunges players into an Eldritch abyss of horrors where waves of enemies stand in the way of their one goal: kill the last angel. \n\"Once a loyal knight, betrayed, and banished to the Abyss,\" a press release for Kill Knight reads. \"A desecrated corpse inside reanimated armor. You rise to an eternal death. Branded Kill Knight, you have one purpose – kill the last angel. Players must learn to exploit enemy weaknesses, enact brutal executions, and weave through the Knight's Arsenal to tactically manage resources as they dance with death in the Abyss and take the fight to global leaderboards against friends and foes alike.\" \nCheck out the Kill Knight reveal trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nIn Kill Knight, players are challenged to master the demon within as they descend through the voids of an eldritch arena and harness a devastating arsenal of armor and weapons against swarms of otherworldly horrors. As you can see in the trailer above, Kill Knight features fast and visceral top-down arcade-action combat with a disgustingly horrific otherworld to traverse through. There are five fatal layers to get through, each more deadly than the last, according to PlaySide Studios. \nAs you survive waves of enemies, your Kill Power will increase, which in turn increases your speed and damage. Plus, there are plenty of challenges to unlock your Knight's Arsenal \"and evolve your playstyle.\" In Master Mode, all five layers become one extended arena, and you can track your skill on a global leaderboard, too. \nHere are some Kill Knight screenshots for your viewing: \n\nKill Knights hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC this year. \nAre you going to check out Kill Knight later this year?

Similar measures are commonplace in dozens of other countries including the UK, where ISP blocking is no longer a topic of discussion. Google plays along voluntarily and following requests from music industry group BPI, has already delisted thousands of domains previously blocked by court order.\nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",

          "description": "Total Eclipse, a real-time, curse-breaking, 3D adventure (with a dash of Indiana Jones flair), is ready for public testing!\nOriginally unleashed by Incentive Software Ltd. in 1988, Total Eclipse added yet another groundbreaking title to their repertoire of revolutionary games.\nStep into the shoes of a heroic archeologist on October 26, 1930, as a total solar eclipse akin to the one happening today over North America looms over Cairo. Knowing of the Ardognus prophecy, created by the powerful high priest Hahmid III, you must find and destroy the hidden shrine devoted to Ra before the eclipse occurs.\nEmbark on this exciting journey packed with a trusty gun for blasting through doors or dispatching undead mummies; a compass to guide you through a treacherous pyramid; a wristwatch to track the precious time left; and a water bottle to fight dehydration (you’re only human after all). \nCan you solve this ancient mystery within 120 minutes and avert catastrophe, or will Rah's wrath obliterate the moon?\nOur modern reimplementation of the Freescape engine features graphics using hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Total Eclipse support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum, and Amstrad CPC. More releases are coming at a later date. Additionally, there are three playable demos if you want to test the game. Please contact us if you have some other release or demo.\nTo play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.\n>",
