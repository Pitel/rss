          "description": "What is this, the Dark Ages?\nThere is a king’s ransom of strategy games on Switch, so it takes a lot for one to stand out from the crowd. Unfortunately, Rising Lords from developer Argonwood is memorable for all the wrong reasons. With hollow, tedious gameplay and a combat system that tries to combine too many elements, we were ready to leave Rising Lords in the Dark Ages almost as soon as we began playing.\nSet years after the previous king was overthrown and replaced with a council, Rising Lords follows a young nobleman who unexpectedly finds himself thrust into the heart of a battle for land, eventually rising as a lord — see what we did there? — of note. The story campaign's plot plays out in a series of choose-your-own-adventure style encounters that help shape your youthful lord and his personality. It isn’t remarkable or groundbreaking but we found it enjoyable enough to keep us interested in the game beyond when the gameplay made us want to switch off.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "I bought Baldur's Gate 3 shortly after its release as a need than a want, when I was a year-and-half into my gender transition and hormone replacement therapy. Gender transition is not just an arduous journey of self-discovery, but also a profound and constant engagement with one’s own reality. I was desperate for some escapism, and Larian Studios’ much-anticipated new entry into the Baldur’s Gate fantasy RPG franchise offered the perfect rabbit hole to fall down.\nAs a child, my gaming habits were relatively stereotypical for a closeted girl: select female characters wherever possible, especially in RPGs. But the immersion almost always wears off. The trans inclusion in games like Dungeon Siege, Sacred 2: Fallen Angel, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion and others is effectively non-existent, and the result for transgender and transsexual players is a feeling that, even in fantasy worlds, we are invisible at best. Nocturne, a trans supporting character in Baldur's Gate III played by Abigail Thorn, has changed that experience for me. In an interview, Thorn shared some of her thoughts and experiences regarding Nocturne and trans representation in games.\n \nRead more",

Now there's too many things to look at in advance, but hey, I'm making steady progress, and you've probably seen the fruits of a couple of these this week already. Next on the list is Dystopika, a toy-like sandbox citybuilder that's sort of in the same vein as the lovely Summerhouse I played earlier this week, but also lives at the exact opposite end of the mood and vibes scale. Whereas Summerhouse is about creating diddly little cute streets with sunny Mediterranean vibes, Dystopika is effectively: Build Your Own Blade Runner. \nRead more",

That means a full selection of DLSS, FSR and XeSS upscalers, plus DLSS 3 frame generation. Real yakuza might use a gamepad, but it seems real fuzz-haired RPG fantasists use graphics cards.\nLet’s take a closer look, then, at how RGG’s latest crime caper performs on PC.

I also say this as someone who's never played or understood a game of poker in her life, because let's face it, regular poker is quite boring. Balatro, on the other hand, is poker that's turbo-charged with magic Joker cards, tarot card multipliers, and blind conditions that make a successful hand increasingly tricky to pull off.

But it wasn't till I embraced the holy medium of videogames that I realised the full potential of balldom. \r\n\n\r\nInitiated, of course, by Sonic the Hedgehog, I descended into a frothing ballpit of ball variations, encompassing everything from the squashy rolling UFOs of Exo One through Katamari Damacy to the overcrowded chutes of Marble World and the spectacle of Overwatch's Hammond clearing out a capture point by means of sheer, delicious torque.

Roots isn't one of your traditional, SimCity-derived town sims in which you steadily colonise a single map (at least, until you lose patience with your glittering urban creation and press the Godzilla or Hurricane button). As per the roguelike element, it's a game about being on the run. \r\n\n\r\nIn Roots, you take charge of a band of warriors fleeing an expanding purple smog, the Ginnungagap, in a flying longship. To escape its coils, you must land on floating islands, play cards to raise settlements, and harvest energy for your vessel from the titular roots of the World Tree. Succumb to the advancing mists, and you'll time-rewind back to your Holt to unlock new mechanics and upgrades. There are also various big-league mythological celebrities to meet and recruit, and a variety of randomised encounters and events to shake up each run. Here's the launch trailer.\r\n\n Read more",

Great building, a sense of scale, a beautiful atmosphere, and the ability to die in extremely stupid ways. In Minecraft, it's digging straight down into lava. In Valheim, it's getting crushed by the very tree you'd just chopped down. And after dying for the third time by trying to climb a slightly-too-steep hill, slipping down and building enough momentum to send me careening off the cliff to my death, I realised that Enshrouded, too, ticks all the boxes for maybe one day being listed among the titans of the genre.\nOne paragraph in, and I've already compared Enshrouded to Valheim. You'll see that quite a bit throughout this review, and for good reason. Enshrouded has come the closest for me to recapturing that feeling of when the world collectively discovered Valheim for the first time. But that's both an accolade and a reservation. Because it's not quite there... yet.\n Read more",

          "description": "Basically the only sort of strategy games I like are city builders, so I was interested in the playtest for El Dorado: The Golden City Builder, which casts you as the leader of an ancient Mayan-ish city. The playtest is only the prologue, but the eventual goal is to take over the Yucatán peninsula, and if nothing else it's refreshing to see a city-builder that doesn't feel overwhelmingly European. It also has a complicated system of religion. Whereas in a similarly polytheistic game like Zeus, the gods would turn up to stomp on buildings and/or bless them, at fairly large intervals, in El Dorado I was getting a home immolated every few days. Building shrines that have an area of effect, and that require resources to run and protect your town, is its own supply chain in El Dorado. This is a very interesting idea that I liked.\nBut. The aforementioned deities are figures from Maya mythology, and the Yucatán peninsula is the bit where the Mayans lived, so I just find it a bit sus the word \"Mayan\" does not appear anywhere on the Steam page or in the press release materials. Sometimes said materials say \"the Yucatán peninsula\", and sometimes \"the mystical land of Jukatan\", which could well be an innocent translation mistake, but doesn't make me less sus. I've hedged my bets by saying \"Mayan-ish\" - just as an uncharitable person could say the devs are doing...\nRead more",

While the game's mechanics are more reminiscent of Ark: Survival Evolved and other tree-punching, template-arranging wilderness sims, its monsters owe obvious debts to Nintendo and Game Freaks' Pokémon games. \nThe developers have something of a track record on this front, with their older early access release Craftopia freely stirring in nods to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. But what separates copyright infringement from a flagrant, but perfectly legal rip-off? Given that a lot of people are making the case for Palworld being copyright theft online, I thought it might be useful to seek insight from (ominous roll of thunder) an actual lawyer.\nRead more",

          "description": "For a series that's defined by its trials and elaborate murder cases, the greatest crime in Ace Attorney history is arguably one we never get to see or take part in. Okay, maybe crime is too strong a word. Miscarriage of justice is perhaps more appropriate, and specifically that of Apollo Justice, the cover star of this latest trilogy in Capcom's beloved lawyer 'em up. Except poor old Apollo isn't really what holds this collection of Ace Attorneys 4, 5 and 6 together at all. Sure, he features in all of them, but at the end of the day, it's still the series' original bluffer supreme Phoenix Wright who heads up most of the casework here, relegating his new protegee back to bench-warming duties almost as soon as Apollo's debut game rolls its credits. What's more, he quickly has to share that space with Athena Cykes, another new hotshot lawyer that enters the firm in Dual Destinies and continues the scrappy defence trifecta in Spirit Of Justice.\nThe result is a set of games that feel considerably wobblier than Capcom's first and more robust Ace Attorney trilogy, and quite a bit more unfocused than the more recent Victorian-era spin-off, The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles. But despite a slightly unsure start, there are still plenty of career highs to be found here for Wright, Cykes and Justice, and Spirit Of Justice in particular remains one of the series' best entries to date. Those new to Ace Attorney should absolutely begin their journey elsewhere, but for series completionists, the Apollo Justice Trilogy is quite the welcome development.\nRead more",

But as that isn't even the top-end Siena part, I also tossed in the 64-core EPYC 8534PN too for a top of stack look for the current EPYC 8004 line-up.",

While once you needed to have a hefty understanding of 6502 programming, creating games for the NES is more accessible to the layperson.\n\n\nIt’s largely just a GUI that makes it easier to visualize your game’s content while also allowing you to plug in various code snippets that handle the functions in a game. It makes things almost too easy, which means one day, I can maybe get down to creating my spiritual successor to Hoshi wo Miru Hito.\n\n\nGreater access to the platform also means that we’ll be seeing more games on the hardware, which brings us to The Adventures of Panzer: Legacy Collection.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThe Adventures of Panzer (Switch [reviewed], Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, PS5)\nDeveloper…",

          "description": "Frontier Developments has announced on Twitter that Planet Zoo is coming to consoles. What consoles? I don’t know. When? I don’t know that, either.\n\n\nIt’s happening, though! Frontier Developments dropped a teaser that shows a controller sitting on a breakroom coffee table (I think) while something unrelated goes on in the background. That’s it. You now know everything that I know.\n\n\n\n\nThat is unless you haven’t played Planet Zoo. Initially released in 2019 as a companion (spin-off?) of 2016’s Planet Coaster, it’s a management sim about building and running your own zoo. The Planet games are all about filling the gap left by games like Roller Coaster Tycoon and Zoo Tycoon. However, I feel they have their own distinct flavor.\n\n\nWhat I mean by that is that Planet Zoo feels like it’s more about customization and building your dream zoo than it is about challenging you to keep it profitable and successful. Don’t get me wrong, there’s still some of that. You do need to keep your zoo profitable and successful, but it just feels so easy. Or maybe it’s just easy for me because I grew up on a hearty diet of tycoon games. I can’t tell anymore.\n\n\nHowever, to me, it felt more like it gave you a tonne of tools and assets to allow you to customize your habitats at a very granular level. This would have really appealed to young Zoey, but old Zoey doesn’t have the same free time or attention span. I do have to wonder how the UI and all those tools will translate to a controller, but we’ll have to wait and see.\n\n\nFor now, you can grab Planet Zoo on PC. Having spent a few paragraphs talking about it, I think I'm going to reinstall.\n\nThe post Planet Zoo is coming to consoles appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "HoYoverse has released another round of its usual character teases for Genshin Impact, and if previous patterns hold up, it's a peak into Version 4.5. However, there's only one new character showcased this time, and it’s someone you might already be familiar with: Chiori of Chioriya Boutique.\n\n\nChiori’s element, weapon, and Constellation\n\n\nChiori’s drip marketing clearly shows her elemental Vision and weapons, locking her in as a Geo Sword user from Inazuma. Her art features a pair of wakizashi or small katana, showcasing a unique dual-wielding style. This isn’t entirely without precedent, since Alhaitham’s animations feature an additional sword on top of the one he normally equips. The remainder of Chiori's kit is yet to be revealed.\n\n\nWe've encountered Chiori before as an NPC during 4.3's Roses and Muskets event. She served as the costume designer for The Two Musketeers during the Fontinalia Film Festival. Now, Chiori is formally introduced as \"The Thundering Seamstress\" and Boss of Chioriya Boutique. We already knew that she was the boss of this small clothing store in the Court of Fontaine, and we got a taste of her direct, no-nonsense attitude during the event quests. It appears we'll soon witness her in combat as well.\n\n\nImage via HoYoverse\n\n\nChiori’s Constellation is Cisoria, Latin for “scissors.” It's quite fitting for her as a fashion designer and seamstress. It might also serve as a subtle reference to her sharp wit and incisive personality.\n\n\nWhen is Chiori coming to Genshin Impact?\n\n\nSince Chiori’s introduction happened on the eve of Version 4.4, we can expect to see her sometime in Version 4.5 of Genshin Impact. If the six-week update schedule holds, Version 4.5 should start on March 13.\n\nThe post Genshin Impact brings a headstrong seamstress to its 4.5 character line-up appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "As part of the 1,900 job cuts that Microsoft made last week, perhaps the most surprising was the coinciding departure of Blizzard president Mike Ybarra. It has been announced that Ybarra’s position will be taken over by Johanna Faries, an executive who helped oversee recent Call of Duty titles at Activision.\n\n\nYbarra stepped into the role of company president in 2021 with the departure of then-president J. Allen Brack, following reports of sexual misconduct, harassment, and discrimination within Blizzard. Ybarra initially shared the role with Jen Oneal but became the sole president when Oneal left the company shortly after.\n\n\nPrior to starting work at Activision Blizzard in 2018, Faries was an NFL executive. Her work with Call of Duty was largely in regards to its esports league.\n\n\nThere was some concern by fans that Microsoft would install their own leadership to the company following Ybarra’s departure. While this isn’t the case, as Faries was already working at Activision Blizzard, I’m not sure it’s going to be of much comfort. Or maybe it will be if you’re someone who enjoys the esports side of Blizzard’s games. I don’t really have much of a horse in this race.\n\n\nFaries introduced herself to Blizzard employees in an email where she identifies herself as a Diablo IV fan. She states that she’s aware that Call of Duties priorities differ from the way Blizzard does things and says she walks “into this role with sensitivity to those dynamics, and deep respect for Blizzard, as we begin to explore taking our universes to even higher heights.”\n\nThe post Blizzard gets a new president from the Activision side of things appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "According to reporting by Bloomberg, Embracer Group is laying off 97 of the staff at Eidos Montreal and has canceled an unannounced title in the Deus Ex series. This is part of an ongoing series of job losses as Embracer contracts after a period of rapid expansion.\n\n\nThe Embracer Group acquired Eidos Montreal as part of a deal with Square Enix in 2022, which saw the latter company divest from its North American studios. This deal also included Square Enix Montreal and Crystal Dynamics, as well as a selection of properties related to those studios, including games like Thief, Tomb Raider, and Deus Ex.\n\n\nMany have been anticipating a new game in the celebrated Deus Ex series since the release of Deus Ex: Mankind Divided back in 2016. Following the lukewarm reception to that game, Square Enix put the series on ice. The Embracer purchase brought some hope to having the series revived once again, but with this cancellation, it seems unlikely.\n\n\nAccording to Bloomberg’s sources, Eidos Montreal had been working on the new entry of Deus Ex for two years, and it was “slated to enter production later this year.” The company will now “instead focus on an original franchise.”\n\n\nA release by Eidos Montreal confirms the layoffs and clarifies that 97 positions were eliminated, it’s a continuation of job losses related to Embracer Group. The losses have included the closure of Timesplitters developer Free Radical and Saints Row’s Volition. \n\n\nIt can be difficult to keep up with the volume of cuts made by Embracer, as it seems that a new round happens on a near-weekly basis. Embracer group is hardly the only company cutting staff, however, as massive job losses have been happening across the industry, with Microsoft laying off 1,900 staff members just a few days ago.\n\n\nWe’re not even out of January yet, and the industry has seen nearly 6000 people lose their jobs. It’s shaping up to be another rough year.\n\nThe post Embracer Group reportedly cancels Deus Ex game, lays off workers at Eidos Montreal appeared first on Destructoid.",

In the announcement, it is stated that we'll see over 15 games during the event.\n\n\n\n\nGames announced include Rise of the Ronin and Stellar Blade, which will receive extended looks. I'm particularly interested in Rise of the Ronin and how it will differentiate itself from aesthetically similar games that have flooded the market.\n\n\nThis year's showcase arrives a bit earlier than last year's first State of Play, but other companies have already been off to the races with their lineups for 2024. Xbox recently hosted its 2024 Developer Direct, locking in some release windows for games like Avowed, Hellbade 2, and Indiana Jones.\n\n\nNintendo, which usually has a February stream of some kind, still has yet to lock in a Direct. Most of the noise around it has been rumors and reports on a potential Switch successor. Whether or not we see a new Switch in 2024 has yet to be confirmed. But with Sony stepping up to the plate, we might start to get an idea of what their year ahead looks like.\n\n\nYou can watch the event on Twitter, YouTube, and Twitch. \n\nThe post First PlayStation State of Play for 2024 airs on Wednesday appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Square Enix is bringing the original Dragon Quest Builders to the PC via Steam on February 13. Originally released as a PlayStation 4 exclusive back in 2016, this will mark the first time the sandbox builder will be on PC. The PC version will include the Terra Incognita DLC as well as upgraded crafting features. Those who have purchased Dragon Quest Builders 2 on Steam will also get a discounted price. \n\n\nImage via Square Enix\n\n\nRe-Rebuild the world of Alefgard\n\n\nEven though the sequel has been available on PC since release, the original coming to PC is a good thing for fans of sandbox builders. The sequel certainly had its own charm, but the original was quite special. Destructoid's own Chris Carter gave the original a 9/10 when it was released back in 2016, assuring fans \"You can breathe easy knowing that Builders is more Dragon Quest than Minecraft\".\n\n\nIn Dragon Quest Builders, players must gather materials and craft unique items and buildings while rebuilding the ruined realm of Alefgard, as they recruit more characters and craft what they need. It's a fun merge of the RPG and sandbox builder genre, and if it sounds like a good time you can rest assured that it is.\n\n\nThe Terra Incognita DLC that is included in the PC version adds a Boss Monster Model Set, an Astronomy Set, a Pixel Ring, and a Magic Carpet. Those interested in playing both the original and the sequel will have the option fo purchasing a bundle of the two.\n\n\nDragon Quest Builders will be released on PC via Steam on February 13. It is already available on Android, iOS, PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch.\n\n\n\nThe post Original Dragon Quest Builders coming to PC in February appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Dust off your Atari 7800, because Plaion and Atari have announced that three of the console’s titles are getting a new cartridge run on May 24, 2024.\n\n\nThe games in question are 1990’s Fatal Run, 1986’s Food Fight, and 1990’s Ninja Golf. All of these are favorites on the platform, but Fatal Run and Ninja Golf were both featured as part of Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration. Food Fight, on the other hand, was only present in its arcade and Atari 800 formats.\n\n\nIf you don’t have an Atari 7800, there’s good news. The Atari 2600+ supports 7800 cartridges, though I had some issues trying to find a controller that was recognized by the hardware. Good news again on that front! Atari is also reissuing the CX78 gamepad. Also, Plaion is working on updating the console’s firmware, so hopefully, better controller compatibility will be added.\n\n\nAfter the failure of the Atari 5200, the 1983 crash, the launch of the NES, and the sale of the company to Jack Tramiel, the Atari 7800 wasn’t really able to find its footing in the market. To make matters worse, the slow release of software left gamers unenthused. It didn’t quite find the audience that the NES or even the Sega Master System did, but some who played it are still affectionate toward the console.\n\n\nIf you’re like me and were too young to really get in on the platform while it was on the market, these reissues might be an exciting piece of history. \n\n\nThe three Atari 7800 reproductions come with a box and cartridge, but that seems to be it. I’m not sure why Atari and Plaion don’t include instruction manuals with their re-releases, but that seems to be continuing with these. They’ll run you $29.99 and release May 24, 2024. They’re available for preorder in some places now.\n\nThe post Three Atari 7800 cartridges are getting reissued May 24 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Even though Silent Hill is coming back in a big way, many still wonder what could have been with P.T., which Konami pulled the plug on. While we'll likely never see a Kojima/del Toro horror collaboration set in the titular foggy town, fans will never stop dreaming.\n\n\nIn a video uploaded to YouTube (as spotted by DSO Gaming), user Maxim Dorokhov has offered their own interpretation of Silent Hill 4: The Room. That is to say, they've recreated the 2004 game entirely in Unreal Engine 5.\n\n\n\n\nA look around the apartment that's been rendered in more up-to-date software gives this 20-year-old release a bit of pep. It's gloomy, pretty realistic looking, and with its first-person perspective, really does make me think of P.T.\n\n\nAnother tease for something that will never be\n\n\nAccording to the report, this is not something that's likely to be made available for public consumption. It seems to be more about showing what UE5 can do in terms of rendering, and Silent Hill 4 appeared to be a good fit for showing off all this detail and moody lighting.\n\n\nIt's also just the apartment sections as well, but that's okay. SH4 is generally regarded as the weakest entry in the classic Silent Hill franchise. However, those moments in the apartment I found to be pretty standout stuff, especially for the time.\n\n\nFirst-person horror was not so common back in the early 2000s, so to get to experience some of it in this game was quite something. It's a shame I never actually got around to finishing SH4, but then I was a lot younger then. I probably had some important kid stuff to be thinking about, like hopes and dreams.\n\nThe post P.T.

Well, unless Nintendo/The Pokémon Company has anything to say about it. Before the call to investigate Pocketpair's game, the modding community has taken to safeguarding itself from potential litigation.\n\n\nIn a news update posted a few days ago, Nexus Mods has decided to put a stop to anyone uploading mods for Palworld that is considered to feature Pokémon copyrighted material. Any modifications that contain assets or characters clearly from the franchise will be taken down.\n\n\n\n\nThe post (written by Community Manager Demorphic) goes on to say that the team doesn't \"think it's worth the risk to allow this content to be shared in our community.\" Fearing the wrath of Nintendo's legal department, Nexus Mods does not want to put itself in a position where it has to \"deal with the headache of legal threats.\" However, the website does say that non-Pokémon content is more than encouraged.\n\n\nIt's all fun and games until someone gets sued\n\n\nIt's fair to say that nobody really expected Palworld to do so well in such a short span of time. Released just ten days ago, it feels like it's all anyone can talk about. The Twitter/X post above shows that a good selection of people are already getting a bit sick of hearing about it.\n\n\nWe don't know what the future holds for the game, but if Nintendo is getting involved, it could well lead to some serious legal troubles. This is why Nexus Mods has decided to take swift action. No one wants to receive a cease-and-desist letter. Not from Nintendo.\n\n\nHey, remember when people were obsessed with Lethal Company?

          "description": "As if there wasn't enough reason to be skeptical about Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League, it appears controversial DRM Denuvo has been added to the PC version of the live service game just days before launch. The Steam Page for Suicide Squad was updated just yesterday to include the following warning message: Incorporates 3rd-party DRM: Denuvo Anti-Tamper.\n\n\n\n\nTough Nut to Crack\n\n\nWhile historically Denuvo DRM has done a decent job of serving its purpose: preventing the game from being cracked and able to spread via piracy, it comes at a cost to those who legally purchase games with it included. In order for the DRM to properly work, every installation must include the Denuvo Anti-Tamper.\n\n\nUnfortunately, Denuvo often leads to performance issues restricted to PC versions of games. Recently released Tekken 8 made sure not to include Denuvo after Tekken 7 launched on PC with horrid performance issues due to Denuvo.\n\n\nOver on Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League's Steam Discussion Boards, players are already voicing their displeasure over the recent addition of Denuvo.\n\n\nNothing new for Warner Bros. Games\n\n\nHonestly, I can't remember the last title published by Warner Bros. Games that didn't include Denuvo. Mortal Kombat launched with it, as did Hogwarts Legacy. By that metric alone, it's not necessarily unexpected that Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League will launch with Denuvo integrated. I think what's more disappointing is that it was seemingly added last minute, with no indication of its inclusion until just a couple of days before launch.\n\n\nSuicide Squad: Kill The Justice League launches on February 2 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. Players who buy the $100 edition can get Early Access today, though servers may be down unexpectedly.\n\nThe post Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League adds Denuvo just before launch appeared first on Destructoid.",

Actually, it's pretty much close to being the most-played game that's ever been released on Steam.\n\n\nThat's according to data from SteamDB. When arranged by \"All-Time Peak\" figures, we can see that Palworld is at the number two spot with 2,101,867 concurrent players. The only game that's ahead of it is PUBG: Battlegrounds, which had a staggering 3,257,248 players about six years ago.\n\n\n\n\nIn order for Palworld to knock it off its top spot, it needs well over another million concurrent players. As popular as the game is right now, even that's something of a tall order. But you never know.\n\n\nCould come crashing down\n\n\nThe fact that Palworld has been unofficially dubbed \"Pokémon with guns\" has not gone unnoticed. The Pokémon Company itself has said it intends to investigate Pocket Pair's hit release for signs of copyright infringement. I mean, the statement didn't say which game in particular, but it's pretty clear what was being talked about.\n\n\nOn top of that, Palworld continues to get updated, with a recent patch having been sent out within the last hour or so. The game is still in development so a lot of people are encountering some pretty severe bugs.\n\n\nI myself have pretty much stopped playing it as it's shut down my Xbox on more than one occasion. That and I can't really decide whether Palworld is for me. My never having played a Pokémon game in my life could well be contributing to my general apathy towards it. There.

Instead, it seeks to impress with its sometimes stomach-dropping sense of flight. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid. \n\n\n\nA maverick mystery\n\n\nUltrawings 2's developer, Bit Planet Games is careful to highlight that the event hasn't been confirmed to be Sony's fault just yet. On Twitter, the studio states the following: \"we want to stress that we don't know what happened. It might have been something we did or didn't do properly. We simply don't know!\" \n\n\nFor obvious reasons, the day-one patch can't make it out when initially planned so you'll have to briefly wait for the \"day one-ish\" patch. Even without the patch, for $20, the game offers 6 planes, over 300 missions to earn a gold medal in, a full campaign, as well as DualSense and HOTAS support. \n\n\nIt might be quite the serendipitous event that the surprise launch occurred, as it brought more attention to the game than it might have initially received.

          "description": "If you're a fan of the Mega Man Zero series but always thought it was a tad slow, you'll want to keep an eye on Berserk Boy. The action-platformer from the appropriately-named BerserkBoy Games is coming to Nintendo Switch and PC on March 6. \n\n\nAhead of its release, the devs have shared a new trailer that confirms the launch date and shows off a bunch of fast-paced action. Throw in a mix of Saturday morning anime cinematics and you have a pretty compelling reason to go berserk yourself. \n\n\n\n\nBerserk Boy is Mega Man meets Sonic the Hedgehog\n\n\nTrue to its inspirations, which appear to range from the Mega Man series to Sonic the Hedgehog, Berserk Boy ticks all the expected bullet points. There's jumping, dashing, and sliding. There are different abilities to harness and toggle between, including Lightning, Fire, Earth, Air, and Ice. There's even a mad scientist and his \"army of darkness\" to contend with. I'm a simple man, I don't ask for much more of a setup than that. \n\n\nThe tunes have a solid pedigree to them, too. The Berserk Boy soundtrack comes from Tee Lopes, known for work on Streets of Rage 4, Sonic Mania, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge, and more. The real standout for me, though, is the speed. It looks like there's a nice mix of combo-chaining, acrobatic challenges and, of course, rail-sliding. We'll see if it lives up to all the games that paved the way for it when Berserk Boy lands this March.  \n\nThe post Berserk Boy looks like a high-speed spin on Mega Man Zero appeared first on Destructoid.",

At least, not for the first few minutes. Shortly after this scene in the actual game, Travis hits a button on his Switch-esque Death Glove and suits up into Iron Man-style mecha armor before returning to his prior well-coiffed, fresh-and-clean look. \n\n\nIt's one of many surrealist, high-flying moments that are thrown at No More Heroes 3 players with little-to-no explanation.

          "description": "“WHELP. IT HAPPENED,” begins the tweet from Lilith Walther (b0tster on Twitter), one of the developers behind Bloodborne Kart, a fanmade spin-off of the popular FromSoftware game. Sony has allegedly contacted them requesting the removal of copyrighted content from the game.\n\n\n“Long story short I need to scrub the branding off of what was previously known as Bloodborne Kart, which we will do. But that requires a short delay,” they continue. However, they add that “the game is still coming out! It'll just look slightly different.”\n\n\n\n\nIt’s not entirely surprising since the Bloodborne Kart directly references the title of the 2015 PS4 game and includes characters from it. The game is a “meme made real,” originating from an April Fool’s Day Tweet back in 2021. What is surprising is that it has taken so long, as the game has been in open development for quite some time now. It’s perhaps because, a few months ago, it was given the release date of January 31, which is next week.\n\n\nOf course, the developers were planning to release the game for free, but it’s still infringing on the company’s copyright. It’s honestly not at all surprising, which Lilith states themself in another tweet, saying, “Like I've said in multiple interviews, we were all expecting this to happen so we could be pleasantly surprised if it didn't.”\n\n\nIt’s definitely a bummer, and I feel bad for the development team who were looking forward to putting their creation in the hands of fans, but they’re taking it in stride. Lilith says, “Turning this into an original game that we have full creative control over is kind of exciting. This is a fan game no more!”\n\n\nLilith says that they are current uncertain of what the new release date will be for the rebranded Bloodborne Kart, but they hope to share news as soon as possible.\n\nThe post After warning from Sony, Bloodborne Kart is dropping references to the brand appeared first on Destructoid.",

Those trying to collect them all have more than 240 cards to look for, including more than 135 etched-foil cards and several Trainer cards.\nThe Pokémon Company sent along a few of the collections and products that contain Paldean Fates booster packs so we could crack them open to see what we could pull. While I'm usually most excited about the Pokémon themselves, one of my favorite pulls this time was a Trainer card: the Nemona full-art Ultra Rare. But that's not to say I didn't pull my fair share of great cards starring some of my favorite Pokémon. I'm always a sucker for a cool Charizard card, and I love the Shiny Toedscruel ex that I found in one of the packs.\n\nPokémon Trading Card Game: Scarlet & Violet – Paldean Fates is available now. For more Pokémon TCG content, including galleries of past expansions, interviews, and the latest news, head to our hub by clicking the banner below.",

Check out the X announcement below.\nGet ready for a new State of Play! https://t.co/KDyuY2Uvfq\n\nTune in on YouTube, Twitch, or TikTok this Wednesday at 2pm PT / 10pm GMT for 40 minutes covering 15+ games, including extended looks at Stellar Blade and Rise of the Ronin, plus more from talented game developers from… pic.twitter.com/MQg76iv8Tt\nJanuary 29, 2024\nThe showcase will specifically show off extended looks at Stellar Blade and Rise of the Rōnin. The former title, previously known as Project Eve, is a stylish action-adventure game that's been teased since 2019. The last we heard, it was delayed into this year, so we're due for a proper look. The latter game is the next project from Team Ninja, the developers behind the Nioh series. It's the studio's most ambitious project to date – check out our December preview here.\nAs for the other 13+ games, we don't have much of an idea. We know it won't include Naughty Dog's recently canceled Last of Us multiplayer spin-off, and we've gone a while without big reveals for a lot of Sony's first-party studios, so hopefully, it can shed some light on the rest of the company's 2024.\nWhat are you hoping to see at Wednesday's State of Play?

While the game will continue to receive support until then, its final story campaign will serve as its last big hurrah. \nReincarnation first launched on July 28, 2021 for iOS and Android and takes place within an unspecified point in the Nier timeline. Like the previous titles, Reincarnation is an RPG set within a mysterious prison world called The Cage, with players controlling different protagonists divided across multiple story arcs. The game has also hosted several crossover events with games such as the remake of Nier Replicant, Final Fantasy XIV, and Persona 5.\nThe shutdown news came the same day as the launch of the latest chapter of its final story arc, The People And The World, dubbed Act II: The Return. Check out the trailer below.\n\n\nIn a shutdown notice, Square Enix states, \nUntil service concludes, Square Enix will offer 10 free summons per day, weekly gem gifts, and other perks. Sales of items on the Premium Shop have ceased. You can read the full rollout of final updates and events in Square Enix's blog post. \nFormer editor Jason Guisao was impressed with Nier Reincarnation, hailing it in an opinion piece as one of the strongest mobile titles available, writing that \"Lengthy narratives and skill-based gameplay loops have come in console/PC-ports like Genshin Impact and PUBG Mobile. Nier Reincarnation, however, employs a happy medium. Heartfelt plotlines with striking visuals, Keiichi Okabe’s mesmerizing score, unintrusive microtransactions, and simple, but rewarding, combat controls establish Reincarnation as one of the best console-like games on mobile devices.\"",

Now, just a few months later, Nintendo has revealed exactly when: February 22, 2024. That's when Wave 2 of the Splatoon 3 expansion pass, which features Side Order as the star of the show, goes live, and it's when players can explore the Spire of Order, a brand new location. \nNintendo announced this news with a short teaser trailer today that shows Agent 8 sleeping on a train. The teaser then transitions to the Spire of Order where a mysterious voice is calling out to Agent 8. \nCheck it out for yourself below in the Splatoon 3 Side Order DLC release date trailer: \n\n\nFor the uninitiated, Agent 8 is the protagonist from Splatoon 2's Octo Expansion. In Side Order, Agent 8 will meet a new character named Acht, who claims to go \"way back\" with Marina, one of the hosts of Splatoon 2. Marina's co-host, Pearl, seems to make an appearance of sorts in Side Order as a robot that accompanies Agent 8 on their journey. \nWith the Spire of Order devoid of color, Acht gives Agent 8 color chips to modify their abilities, like boosting run speed and increasing damage. It's likely Agent 8's colored ink will be used to bring color back to the spire, too, but we'll have to wait until February 22 to find out. \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer's Splatoon 3 review, and then check out what else is in the Splatoon 3 expansion pass. \nAre you going to check out Side Order next month?

Not only is The Joker joining the game, but he'll be a new playable member of the Suicide Squad. \nNotably, this take on The Joker is not the Mark Hamill-voiced character from the Batman: Arkham series. Instead, Brainiac is pulling Elseworlds together in an attempt to merge them into a unified multiverse. This is how The Joker in Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League joins the roster.

While that reveal included details about the survival aspects of the game, including multiplayer, crafting, and farming, viewers honed in on the idea of it being Pokémon but with guns. You can capture Pokémon-like monsters called Pals in special balls (and you can capture humans, too), but it's smart to shoot them or hack at them with an axe first to lower their health. And then, once under your command, you can give them their own guns to use, of course. \nFollowing various trailers since that 2021 reveal, including this gameplay showcase and this one highlighting the different Pals you can find, we learned at Geoff Keighely's Summer Game Fest last year that Palworld would finally…",

Square Enix also revealed Visions of Mana will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC this summer.\nExecutive producer Masaru Oyamada discussed the franchise's history, noting there have been 17 entries across its 30 years of existence. He also points out that what is now the Mana series today actually began as Final Fantasy Adventure in 1991. \n\n\nMana series creator Koichi Ishii also joined this segment of the show to discuss how he has supervised the team on its work and implementation of taking what were originally pixelated monsters and converting them into the 3D monsters players will fight in the game. \nNotably, Visions of Mana is the first Mana game coming to Xbox. Oyamada expressed Square Enix's excitement about this first for the series while diving deeper into its real-time action combat. This real-time action combat is what originally separated Final Fantasy Adventure from the Final Fantasy series, which was strictly turn-based at the time. \nVisions of Mana's combat continues to look great, as does its beautifully vibrant world. Unfortunately, there's still a few months to go until PlayStation, Xbox, and PC players can play it because it's due out sometime this summer. \n\nWhile waiting for its release, check out the Visions of Mana announcement trailer from The Game Awards 2023 last month. \nAre you excited for Visions of Mana?
