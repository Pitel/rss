It’s a goodbye to a Moomin, so perhaps you’d think it’s not an important goodbye – just a Moomin, after all. But it sets up the main arc of a well-paced and imaginative musical adventure.\nFor the uninitiated – and we’re not exactly experts ourselves here – a Moomin looks like a cross between a snowman and a hippo. They walk upright and talk, and appear to have the ability to cultivate crops and build quite sophisticated houses. The human-like Snufkin has seemingly been accepted into their society and is called upon to assist with their various problems. These problems range from a dry garden to a lost manuscript and everything in between. “What could lie in between a dry garden and a lost manuscript?”, you might ask. Answer: a giant crab to whom Snufkin must play a flute at level 4 inspiration. But more on all that later…\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Aggressively attacked.\nWith Konami seemingly devoid of both in-house developers and any kind of passion to revive their beloved IPs, WayForward, predominately a licence mule during the '00s, is by far the best option for a new Contra entry. Its work on 2007’s brutally hardcore Contra 4 cemented the developer's prowess, allowing the player to grapple hook between the Nintendo DS’s twin screens. Those who stuck with it discovered a worthy tribute to Konami’s iconic series: a strict memoriser full of magnificent setpieces and high-end destruction worthy of the name.\nIt’s been 16 years too long, and Contra: Operation Galuga has arrived in a markedly different kind of gaming landscape to that of 2007. It’s thanks in part to modern expectations that this new iteration comes with a litany of adjustable content. Where Arcade Mode follows a classic, uncluttered format, Story Mode is filled with cutscenes, in-game communications, and on-screen NPCs that join you sporadically during the action.

Sure, perhaps there are some early oddball entries that people missed — games that were crafted when the template and direction of the series was still in flux — but it's hard to argue that these represent the most analysed, most considered and reconsidered video games ever made.\nWhether they're celebrated genre-definers or one of the lesser entries in the Mushroom Kingdom canon, surely every single Mario game is rated absolutely appropriately, right? Sunshine is famously not as polished as other mainline 3D Marios, but it's got some great bits, too.

Cline, who you will remember is the writer of Ready Player One, is apparently one of the co-founders of Readyverse, and I'm sad to see he's still in search of a second idea. Open (that's the name of the game, but it's in all caps in their press assets) is an \"immersive multiverse filled with nostalgia-infused biomes featuring characters and cultural legends across iconic franchises\", coming to early access this year.

Sure, Bloodlines 2 might prove a winner, but given years of delays and a developer change, I'll believe it when I see it.\nWhich brings us to Vampire: The Masquerade - Justice, the beleaguered series' first prowl through the rain-slick streets of VR. In theory, this should be exactly my cup of haemoglobin; a gothic, linear stealth game where you use your vampire powers to sneak across the rooftops of Venice. In its mechanics and design, Justice aspires to be a cut down version of Dishonored. Unfortunately, it's in the cutting down where most of its problems arise. It's too cramped, too basic, and too fuzzy around the edges, and the whole experience ends up being a bit mid.\nRead more",

Whatever the case, Funcom want you to know that their upcoming survival game Dune: Awakening has nothing to do with any of that, posting a short Xeet from the official Awakening account that's the written equivalent of sticking your arms straight out, waving your hands, and going \"Woahwoahwoah, hang on a minute.\"\n\"We agree that religion is an integral part of the Dune universe. This is why in Dune: Awakening you will meet and interact with people of different religions along your journey. However, as opposed to the story presented in the books, the player is not a messiah and will not play a major role in any of them.

          "description": "Dragon's Dogma series director Hideaki Itsuno has announced that the meat you can cook over campfires in Dragon's Dogma 2 is, in fact, \"real meat\". There's been a certain amount of PlayStation-instigated speculation about whether the meat is CGI-generated, following the last round of Dragon's Dogma 2 previews. Speaking to Japanese site 4Gamer, as translated by Automaton, Itsuno revealed that the game's scenes of sizzling flesh are derived from live action film of steaks being grilled - partly for the sake of authenticity, and partly to save money versus creating computer models of meat products. You can cook several types of meat in Dragon's Dogma, each of which has its own cutscene, and a number of Dragon's Dogmatists are already performatively salivating at the prospect on social media.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Towards the conclusion, one NPC is selected as \"Beloved\" and promptly abducted by a dragon for you to quest forth and rescue. There are a few characters who are positioned more obviously as romanceables, but the brilliance of the system is that you can raise your Affinity with pretty much anybody. If you want to finish the game staring passionately into the eyes of the court jester or that hearty bloke who runs the armour shop, it's within your power.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Zoria: Age Of Shattering speedruns its fantasy RPG origin story in a quick cutscene montage at the start, so we might as well get that out of the way first, too. Low fantasy world, two warring kingdoms, one uses necromancy (this is cast as bad and cheating rather than practical, for some reason) to comprehensively gain the upper hand, and everything is named like a bunch of Scrabble letters were thrown randomly on the table. You play Elion war hero Captain Witherel - gender and class TBD by the player - in a small group making a final stand at the fortress Daeg Marastir, which is being overrun by the nefarious Izirian army. We start in media bellum, as it were.\nThis first stage, where you escape the fortress, gives you a whistle-stop tour of the main systems in the game. You control a squad of four, the combat is turn-based, you can pitch camp at any time to rest and heal up, and there are crafting systems for potions, food and gear. Zoria isn't really remaking the wheel as much as it is taking spokes from a bunch of other fantasy RPGs you like, and the result is the terrier of RPGs. Small, clearly has a lot of different DNA knocking around in there, and punches above its weight, but it's a bit scrappy and sometimes it's knees dislocate and it falls over. This terrier was made by three people, so that is sort of to be expected.\nRead more",

          "description": "Since the summer of 2020, Unknown 9: Awakening has only existed as a 90-second cinematic teaser trailer. In it, a young girl called Haroona is chased through the narrow streets of Calcutta by a rabble of boys armed with sticks. It's not clear why she's attracted their ire, but as one moves to strike her, a shockwave pulses out from her small body, the world turns grey, and time slows down. As she deftly moves out of harm's way, she turns back to look at her stunned onlookers, a confident smirk rising on her face.\nIt was a striking, if utterly ambiguous debut, and with talk of accompanying podcasts, books, comics and a web series also on the way to help build out this new world even further, it felt like developers Reflector Entertainment were really setting out to make a bold and ambitious first impression. But it's now been four years since that trailer. The books, podcasts and comics have all come and gone, seemingly making little impression, and Awakening, the game aiming to pull this big, expanded universe together, has arguably slipped from both time and memory. Perhaps this will change with its newly-dated summer 2024 release window on the horizon, but having seen a small, hands-off slice of an early mission in the game at publisher Bandai Namco's offices a couple of weeks ago, Awakening's certainly got its work cut out for it.\nRead more",

The first was to discover if there's anything genuinely different about this undeniably enchanting but very familiar sequel to one of the happiest, barmiest action-RPGs of the past 20 years. The second was to royally screw myself by fielding a party consisting exclusively of magic-users. \r\n\n\r\nIn Dragon’s Dogma 2 as in Dragon’s Dogma 1, you lead a gang of up to three AI-controlled \"pawn\" characters – one permanent main sidekick who levels up alongside you, plus two auxiliary pawns created by other players, who are either summoned at Rift stones or spawned into the open world as hired help. As in most RPGs, the ideal party setup is a mix of pure melee, ranged and magical DPS or support classes, but given the whimsicality of Dragon’s Dogma’s sorcery, with its levitation spells and lightning whips, I’ve always wanted to try a whole playthrough as a posse of unescorted occultists.\nRead more",

          "description": "As someone who finds games about cars wot go fast only intermittently interesting, I'd expect a game about cars wot go slow to be positively soporific. Speed is, ultimately, the modus operandi of a car. It gets you where you need to go faster than a horse, and doesn't do annoying things like pooing on your patio or dying (also, potentially, on your patio). Surely, then, playing a game about cars moving at the speed of a dead patio horse defeats the point, like playing a first-person shooter where all the guns fire backwards.\r\n\n\nExpeditions: A Mudrunner Game demonstrates this not to be the case. This bouncy, slimy off-roading simulator is the most fun I've had with an imaginary car since 2018's Jalopy. This is partly because it is as much a physics puzzler filled with limitless conundrums as it is a game about driving, but also because, like Jalopy, it envisions the car as something more than a way to boost egos by doing a big circle.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's these outbursts that Wiktor will be investigating over the course of this curious detective RPG from the makers of Seven: The Days Long Gone and the upcoming The Witcher 1 Remake, as fortunately for him, Wiktor comes from a long line of storied Salutor tamers, his thaumaturgic know-how allowing him to see these monsters made flesh, exorcise them from their human host, and use them for his own gains.\nHe's a man that's ultimately made peace with his own arrogance, then, but considering everything he goes through during The Thaumaturge's 25 hour-odd run-time, I reckon his pride is pretty justified. Not only is he able to brush off multiple stab and gunshot wounds and clubs to the face when he gets in a fight, but he also achieves several feats of thaumaturgy that we're repeatedly told are thought to be nigh on impossible. Indeed, at the start of this game, his connection with his original Salutor Upyr is hanging by a thread, his worst instincts having got the best of him in a recent attempt to tame and capture a second beast from the ether. By the end, however, I had six Salutors at my beck and call, out of a total of eight. Wiktor is very much a force to be reckoned with, and he makes for a highly compelling lead as you navigate the branching storylines in Warsaw's political hotbed.\nRead more",

There's a meteor scheduled to slamdunk the planet in 30 days, and in that time, you and your fellow players must progress from raising log cabins in the woods to building the means to develop technologies that might somehow avert the apocalypse. The trouble is, pioneering said apocalypse-averting technologies might itself bring about disaster in a gameworld that simulates things like habitat death, species extinction, air pollution and catastrophic flooding. \r\n\n\r\nPlayers must thus walk a careful line between resource exploitation and self-inflicted calamity by monitoring their impact on the overall simulation, founding the right kind of government, and passing laws or devising economies (including player-created currencies) that don't flip the ecosystem upside down. The Steam reviews teem with anecdotes about people waking up to find their oil wells underwater, and it sounds like things will only get knottier when Eco releases out of early access around the end of this year.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Folks who like Elden Ring and Dark Souls are going to go absolutely bananas for it.'

There’s that same lurching, exquisite tension as you delve deeper and deeper into darkness where you are not welcome, supplies dwindling, footfall echoing, monstrosities skittering about in the black. On my most intense plunge into one cave, I groaned aloud as the path I was praying must be the exit twisted back on itself, sending me first down a rope, and then into a long slide down, down into the earth, back into the spindly clutches of pale, bifurcated mutants. When I finally saw the sun again, I could have cried.\nIt’s still a bit wonky, but the full 1.0 release makes the Forest a fuller, livelier and more inviting (or else alluringly off-putting) prospect for a wander - even, as in my case, a wholly solo one.

One of the prominent changes with the NVIDIA R550 Linux driver is bringing the GeForce and workstation GPU support up to \"CERTIFIED\" quality when using NVIDIA's open kernel modules that are distributed as part of their driver package. Previously the open-source (out-of-tree) kernel modules were just certified for their data center GPUs while now they are basically acknowledging that they are in good shape too for GeForce and workstation products. In this article are some benchmarks of the open and proprietary kernel driver options of the NVIDIA R550 Linux driver.",

At the moment, no matter what quality a fruit tree is, cutting it down will result in only wood and the loss of the tree. To get a new tree, players have to pay a visit to Pierre's shop in order to purchase a new sapling. \n\n\nWell, after 1.6, Pierre’s profits are set to drop because cutting down fruit trees will provide players with a sapling, which can be planted to provide the same fruit. Players are understandably overjoyed at the tidbit of information, with commenters celebrating this as a ‘game changer’, especially at end-game when it comes to redesigning the farm. \n\n\nThere is one caveat to this update, as ConcernedApe details within the comments of his post; saplings that have been obtained through chopping down a tree will grow faster, but the fruit will not be of the same quality immediately, increasing in quality as it always has. \n\n\nPatch 1.6 will go live on March 19, the first day of spring, so we’re not likely to see any more small updates like this before then, but we will of course share the patch notes once they’re available, so watch this space.\n\nThe post ConcernedApe shares a random line from upcoming Stardew Valley 1.6 patch notes, getting players excited for fruit trees appeared first on Destructoid.",

You’ll need to utilise Fishing, Foraging and Gardening in order to procure the following items:\n\n\n\n1 Lemon\n\nForaged from Lemon trees, which grow in the Forest of Valor and the Glade of Trust.\n\n\n\n\n1 Onion\n\nGrown from seeds which can be purchased at Goofy’s Stall in the Forest of Valor for 50 Star Coins each.

          "description": "The hustlin' and bustlin' MultiVersus crew is back with new features on the horizon, as the latest developer update unveils the next step in the action-packed journey. The fighting game has certainly gone through some highs and lows, especially with its open beta shutting down prior. But after a year out of the arena, Multiversus will be released on May 28, 2024. \n\n\nDuring the developer update, Tony Huynh, Game Director and Co-Founder of Player First Games, discussed new characters and maps. In it, he states, \"I'm happy to say we'll be adding some really exciting, brand-new personalities to the roster.\" Fans speculate on who these mysterious characters could be, from Scooby-Doo to the Joker. \n\n\n\n\nMultiversus' visual department improves significantly with Unreal Engine 5, bringing more details to character designs. Compared to its Unreal Engine 4 version, I could definitely see a difference in the brief snippet we got. Wonder Woman's beta form didn't necessarily do her justice previously. But fortunately, the character lighting and shading seem more fitting for Princess Diana now.\n\n\nOther than visuals, Player First Games finely tunes its new netcode to convey more precise movements. More and more fighting games continue to tweak and perfect this framework, as we've seen in Dragon Ball FighterZ and Street Fighter 6. There's nothing worse than executing a punch only for it to be delayed during a hectic online showdown. So, it's pleasing to see another brawler get another fresh update for those nice and smooth movements. \n\n\nAlthough Multiversus primarily showcases a competitive PvP, a new PvE has entered the battlefield. What this entails is unknown, yet we know it will introduce unique challenges and rewards.

Helldivers earn them by completing missions and objectives and can spend them on better gear, an investment in their future.

          "description": "Incube8 Games has announced that they’re going to be the ones to stamping AgeOfGames unreleased Game Boy Advance game, Kien, to cartridge this year. It will be released in Q2 2024 on GBA.\n\n\nKien was originally set to launch during the GBA’s heyday in 2002. As the story goes, the game made it as far as being sent to review publications at the time, only to be canceled before release. It got picked up and canceled again by other publishers but was never released. However, a prototype ROM did get leaked and made its rounds.\n\n\n\n\nIt’s a mix of action-platformer and RPG. The story involves two apprentices fighting evil in the wake of the disappearance of the 7 Masters of the Absolute.\n\n\nOne thing to keep in mind here is that Kien is maybe not great. Nintendo Power was among the publications at the time that reviewed it (issue 173, November 2003), and the five staff members who looked at it gave it an average of three out of five stars. That makes it slightly better than Power Rangers: Ninja Rescue by their sizing of it, but not as good as Ultimate Beach Soccer. Nintendo Power reviews were weird at that time.\n\n\nIn any case, the Incube8 release will come with a cartridge, protector, box, manual, and stickers. It's great to see a game that never got a chance back in the day being given some life, and I've been enjoying the age of retro reproductions we're currently living in.\n\n\nKien will be available for GBA sometime in the second quarter of 2024. Though, it would show real commitment if they canceled it at the last minute.\n\nThe post Thrice-canceled GBA game Kien is finally getting released 22 years after completion appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Last week saw the exciting new trailer for the upcoming Fallout show. While the adaptation is going to be telling its own story, you may be wondering whether it might touch on Fallout 5's possible narrative, even accidentally. However, Todd Howard has made sure that hasn't happened.\n\n\nIn a recent interview with Den of Geek (as spotted by VGC), the show's executive producer Jonathan Nolan clarified whether the TV series is, to some extent, Fallout 5. Nolan says a conversation between him and Todd discussed the idea of the show being a part of the overall Fallout universe, rather than being a retelling of one of the game's stories.\n\n\n\n\nTodd Howard then said he made sure the showrunners didn't do certain things. He said he told the crew, \"don't do this, because we're going to do that in Fallout 5.\" There's even a joke about how the adaptation is almost like Fallout 6. But the consensus is that the show is its own story and doesn't tread on anything that's come before or after it in terms of arc.\n\n\nSpeaking of Fallout 5...\n\n\nWhen Bethesda confirmed the next Fallout game was currently being worked on, I think it's safe to assume people thought it was too early to make such an announcement. Starfield was still very much in development at the time, and we still have absolutely no idea what's going on with The Elder Scrolls 6 since that 2018 E3 tease.\n\n\nIn short: don't expect Todd to start giving away too much about F5 or TES6 anytime soon. I think he's still coasting on the (ahem) success of Starfield, but hopefully, the studio is making some headway on the new projects.\n\n\nIn the meantime, Fallout will be airing on April 11 via Amazon Prime Video.\n\nThe post Todd Howard made sure the Fallout TV series didn’t include Fallout 5 ideas appeared first on Destructoid.",

But these Moogles, in the words of more than one player, \"look like cursed Koalas.\" I have to admit, that was my first thought upon seeing them, too.

You could be forgiven for not being familiar with the character. Though he has made appearances in North America, he's never reached the popularity of his comic contemporaries like The Peanuts Gang or Mickey Mouse. I only became aware of the character after visiting developer Remedy in Finland in 2015 for our <a href=\"https://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2015/11/03/december-cover-revealed-quantum-break.aspx\">Quantum Break cover story</a>. Members of Remedy's team educated me on the character and I brought back Moomin merchandise as souvenirs for my family.</p>\n\n<p>I had not thought much about the character since then, but recently, Moomin and his friends have been slowly invading my life prompting me to wonder if Moomin is on the verge of a United States popularity breakthrough. Developer Hyper Games and publisher Raw Fury must have thought the same thing, because it is releasing a Moomin video game on March 7.</p>\n\n<p>Check out the video below to learn more about Moomin and see the cozy game in action.</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameBorder=\"0\"  allow=\"autoplay\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-GOm7xY1tyg\" width=\"640\"></iframe>\n\n<p>Head over to&nbsp;<em>Game Informer's&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/gameinformer\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube channel</a>&nbsp;for more previews, reviews, and discussions of new and upcoming games.

Contrary to some reports, today's changes don't amount to a total ban on VPNs. Use of state approved VPNs, which do everything except the useful stuff, remain legal. The new law criminalizes the promotion of VPNs for site-blocking circumvention. But Russia also wants citizen's to stay safe, warning that VPNs in the U.S. are prone to government spying.\nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",

          "description": "For the 17th time, ScummVM has again been accepted for the Google Summer of Code program this summer.\nThe program intends to bring new contributors into open source projects. In the most recent two years this has included both students and non-students as eligible candidates for participation.\nLike last year, participants can apply for working on either short tasks (about 175 hours of work), or large tasks (about 350 hours of work). The coding period typically runs from start of June through August, but there is some flexibility which allows participants to have longer time frames if they are unable to work full time through the summer.\nScummVM is looking for people interested in participating in GSoC with us. A list of suggested projects can be found on this page, but we are also open to your own ideas as well. Please provide the required information in your application before submitting.\nWe also strongly encourage you to join our Discord server, in the #scummvm-gsoc channel. This allows you to engage with our mentors and the rest of the team, to get advice about how to get involved with the project, as well as writing your application.\nBased on our previous 16 years of experience with GSoC, we have put together a Google Summer of Code miniportal to help you get started.\nLooking forward to hearing from you!\n>",

          "description": "If you don’t know me, I’m Owen Rudge, and have been involved in the online Transport Tycoon community for almost 25 years. Exactly 21 years ago, I received an ICQ message (look it up, kids) out of the blue from a guy named Ludvig Strigeus (nicknamed Ludde). “Hello, you probably don’t know me, but I’ve been working on a project to clone TTD for a while.” he said, more or less. He didn’t want to release this to the public yet, and wasn’t entirely sure what he was going to do with it. (He’d been working on it since 30th June 2002, so I guess that is technically the birthday of what would become OpenTTD…) Ludde sent me a copy of what he’d been working on, and it was very exciting indeed. It was a fully functional version of Transport Tycoon Deluxe, written in C. Admittedly incomplete at that time, it was still quite remarkable.",
