          "description": "It's not about a shark.\nThey say cheaters never prosper, but clearly they’ve never played Card Shark, a wonderfully tense, goofy little game that’s all about keeping your cool under tremendous pressure as you basically rob people blind. The act of pulling off the con is shockingly simple, but maintaining one’s composure to ensure that everything goes according to plan is shockingly not simple. Published by Devolver Digital, it’s the kind of game that’ll stick with you long after the credits have rolled, and if you’re even remotely interested, we’d very much encourage you to give it a go.\nCard Shark takes place in 18th century France and places you in the role of a mute servant boy. While waiting on a boisterous noble calling himself the Comte de Saint-Germain (who actually existed) at the behest of your patron, you get roped into helping the rascal cheat in a game of cards in exchange for some of the winnings. Unfortunately, your opponent eventually gets wise to what you’re up to and your patron gets fatally shot in the ensuing struggle. Impressed by your con-artist skills and preying upon your newfound homelessness, the Comte thus takes you under his wing and the two of you set out on an adventure to fleece all manner of high society nobles across France. All the while, you slowly begin to realize that the Comte is tangled up in a bigger conspiracy concerning the French royalty.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The downside is that it's launching exclusively on Apple Arcade later this month, but we've seen a lot of games move from that platform over to Switch after a specific period; there's definitely hope.\nCalled Air Twister, it looks likes a rather fun return to arcade-style gameplay in the trailer, with giant swans (or small people?) also coming into the game. The music is by Valensia, a Dutch composer, producer and multi-instrumentalist; according to this Wikipedia page they did an album called 'Queen Tribute' in 2003.

Another notable feature of the first is how grisly and mature it is - the new title is likely to also be an 18+ experience, so be forewarned on that.\nIn any case, Piofiore: Episodio 1926 now has a release date - it'll arrive on 22nd September, with physical editions and the usual eShop release. There'll be a standard edition of course, but Aksys is also promoting a Limited Edition that can be pre-ordered on its official store.

But much like the iconic Greek masks of comedy and tragedy, it's pointless to have happiness without its counterpart, sadness.\nLightness needs darkness to exist, and so too does laughter need sorrow — and, you know, sometimes it's just really cathartic to have a nice big sob session.

It turns out that, not only are there a lot of locations in Elden Ring, but the definition of a distinct location is largely up for debate. The opening area of Limgrave, for example, could be as many as four separate regions (East Limgrave, West Limgrave, Stormhill and Weeping Peninsula) depending on how you interpret it. That's not to mention all of the dungeons, caves, chapels, and other landmarks scattered throughout the Lands Between.\nYet like a newly minted Wretch squaring up to Margit the Fell Omen for the first time, I am prepared to plough on despite the pain that awaits. Below you'll find a comprehensive ranking of Elden Ring's major regions and legacy dungeons, based on the admittedly woolly criteria of how fun and interesting each location is to explore.

Al fresco dining, excluding that bit where a wasp crawls into your glass of Fanta, which seems to happen to me a lot. Music festivals, minus the part where you queue for half an hour to have a wee. Oh, and obviously spending time on a beach somewhere hot, purposefully ignoring that horrible bit where you try to get your socks back on after taking a dip in the ocean and the sand scrapes against your skin.\r\n\n\r\nOK, so maybe summer isn’t all it’s cracked up to be.

You're missing some things from higher-end Z690 boards - like PCIe 5.0, USB-C ports and 2.5-gig networking - but nothing that affects gaming performance, at least in the here and now. \nRead more",

Take a sheet of plain paper, turn it horizontal, draw two long lines across it, dividing it into three strips. That’s a level; that’s a side-scrolling environment. That’s what I’d do, basically all the time, basically every day. You could call me a budding game designer, only I had no knowledge of how to transfer my genius creations into digital form. I’d tried before, with Doom, but the editor was incomprehensible. Sectors? Vectors? Call me a particularly stupid child, but I just wanted to draw two long lines on a piece of paper.\r\n\n\r\nEnter Speedy Eggbert, a budget-priced platform game that scored “the world’s first generous 4% review” in PC Gamer magazine. But I wasn’t aware of that yet. I was, though, aware of its big, shiny box on the shelves of Game, with its gorgeously embossed Eggbert and a reverse emblazoned with screenshots and features, including the most enticing few words I’d ever seen – “MAKE YOUR OWN LEVELS!”\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's already much more polished than the demo, with more yet to come. It's a life sim with a bit of a Stardew Valley or Animal Crossing vibe, except instead of farming you are a witch called Ellie (size: small) living in a biome (type: forest).\nIn the story you start to free the nearby village from cursed vines, and this requires that you catalogue and collect ingredients for spells, and thence expand your repertoire of witchy recipes. At the same time you can trade spells and magical candy with locals for currency, which you can use to improve your little machines - a roaster, a caldron, a press for ingredients - to make even better things, more efficiently. It's a satisfying process of mastery and exploration. But that is not the important bit. The important bit is that Little Witch In The Woods is disgustingly adorable.\nRead more",

In a community post, AMD asserted this particular Preview Driver could provide double-digit percentage gains in games running DirectX 11; claims that were backed up by early independent testing, like the creator of benchmarking tool CapFrameX getting an extra 24% out of Crysis Remastered.\r\n\n\r\nThis week, AMD Software Adrenaline Edition 22.5.2 released, making that new Radeon driver available to anyone who didn’t fancy switching to preview builds. Armed with an RX 6500 XT (a low-end card that desperately needs a performance kick), I gave the new software a whirl – and found that, for all those big numbers, Radeon owners should probably lower their expectations.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Unless there’s a direct sequel, you must pull your pants up and shelve those emotions and move on.\nNot that I struggle with letting go of characters and stories particularly, but my brain makes an exception for the Yakuza games. More specifically, Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio's games. I’ve reached a point where I’m ordering Lost Judgment with no intention of playing it for months - maybe even a year?

You'll be able to wish for her in the gacha from May 31st, but in the meantime, MiHoYo have set up a web event to let players get to know this mysterious newcomer a little bit better. Naturally, you'll be rewarded with in-game goodies (including Primogems) for taking part.\nRead more",

Despite RRPs of over £400, you can get a basic model for £245 or a slightly fancier box for £270. Either way, you'll have a ton of storage space for backups, video projects, game install directories and other media. \nMy colleagues at Digital Foundry pick these drives up regularly for their video production work, as capturing game footage and creating YouTube videos quickly causes standard hard drive sizes to fill up. You never want to be in a situation where you're forced to delete your old work to save the new stuff, so having a capacious backup like this is perfect. \nRead more",

That includes RPS’ own Ed, whose otherwise glowing preview mentioned some performance issues on Nvidia GPUs. \r\n\n\r\nI’m duty-bound to investigate any potential hardware hitches, though since V Rising is only in early access, this isn’t going to be the usual appraisal of how it performs on various PC hardware. That can wait until it’s had more of the spit ‘n’ polish treatment that typically comes with the status of actually being finished. That said, I have done a full sweep of V Rising’s graphics settings and their performance impact, so if your FPS count is melting like a Nosferatu on an ill-considered Corfu holiday, have a look below to see if you can make some fruitful tweaks.\r\n\n \nRead more",

All three titles will be available to add to your library until July 5.]\nIn what has now become a regular monthly event, the next PlayStation Plus offerings have been leaked ahead of their official announcement — As noted by regular spoiler billbil-kun of Dealabs, June will see PS Plus subscribers bag themselves copies of Sony's God of War, Gamemill's Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl, and Bandai Namco's Naruto to Boruto: Shinobi Striker.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np1jPkg3R6Q\nAssuming that the leak is genuine, (and there's very little reason to believe it isn't), the three titles will be available to download from June 7 until July 5. The June titles will replace May's offerings of EA's FIFA 22, Focus Entertainment's Curse of the Dead Gods, and Gearbox Publishing's Tribes of Midgard, so be sure to secure your license for these three titles before they vanish for good.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Yl-_LYD0ik\nJune will also see Sony launch its revamped PlayStation Plus subscription service. The new service offers three distinct subscription tiers — Essentials, Extra and Premium — which will afford access to a rotating library of PlayStation releases on PS5, PS4, PS2, and the original PlayStation, dependent on your membership. Sony will continue to offer up a monthly selection of \"to-keep\" titles for all subscribers, regardless of their respective subscription tier.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ypgtAyjSCo\nFor more information on the new PlayStation Plus service, see our previous report right here.\nThe post June’s PlayStation Plus games include God of War and Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl appeared first on Destructoid.",

(And bring money. Lots of money!) The physical game purveyor is hosting its LRG3 digital showcase on June 6 at 1:00 p.m. Pacific.\nFor this year's showcase, Limited Run Games will be covering \"over 30 awesome game trailers and physical release reveals for bespoke, high-quality collector's editions,\" which is par for the course at this point. You'll be able to watch along on the company's Twitch channel. Expect to see plenty of Mega64 shenanigans, as the boys are back in town.\nhttps://twitter.com/LimitedRunGames/status/1532064573771358208\nWe know of at least one high-profile release that'll show up: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge. A tweet last month confirmed a Collector's Edition reveal at LRG3.\nI feel like some of you will tune in just for TMNT, but that's just one of many games. There's plenty of room for other limited editions, and it's been great to see Limited Run (and other folks doing similar work) on the rise in spite of industry trends. As we've seen, there's still plenty of demand for physical releases — especially when they're done right.\nFor those of you in North Carolina (or anyone willing to travel for the sake of hard-to-find video games), Limited Run recently opened its first retail store in Cary, as pictured above. I haven't been! But have you ever had that dream where you've somehow stumbled upon the motherload — rare games as far as the eye can see — and then you wake up?\nWith new showcases filling out the rest of June, LRG3 won't be everyone's top priority, but it's bound to be a fun one for collectors. Let's all try to stay on budget, shall we?\nThe post Pencil in the Limited Run Games showcase for June 6 appeared first on Destructoid.",

And it looks like Reddit user fiveonthakush got a lot out of it with this Mario Kart Live setup.\nTheir case is a masterpiece, in that it holds four playable karts, as well as four units of Switch hardware: which double as the controllers and screen in which to view the karts as they race around a real-life \"track.\" All they'd need to do is keep the Switches charged, then carry it anywhere they want for some family fun.\nThe creator says the case is from mycasebuilder.com, designed with \"lower foam,\" which they cut out based on the specifications, with a \"routed lid\" to ensure that the top didn't tightly press down on the karts and the Switch hardware. Interestingly, they \"swapped parts on the karts\" so they could tell all four apart. If you look closely, there's a green kart with a red \"Mario\" M on it, and a red kart with a red Mario M: vice versa for two karts that feature Luigi. That way you can more easily tell who \"players one through four\" are. They say that they hope to get even more use out of the game because of the case, which makes it easier to transport: and had fun putting the set together.\nWith that said, it's sad that Velan Studios/Nintendo never released proper \"player three or player four\" karts: but for Nintendo's experimentation, a lack of follow-through is par for the course (RIP Labo?). I know there is a community around the game, and I hope it gets some sort of follow-up someday.\nThe post This Mario Kart Live setup is extremely cool appeared first on Destructoid.",

The developer made the announcement in a statement to the press this week.\n\"We are reintroducing the apostrophe and the space between the words to truly embrace the meaning of DON’T NOD. DON’T NOD is two words to represent our tendency to be non-conventional as a company and in the games that we create — as in, we DON’T NOD along to everyone else’s tune,\" writes the newly named company. \"The D [in our logo] is shattered, and the N appears within it, signifying that we are not afraid to break the mold. This new logo links our games — meaningful, powerful stories — with who we are as a company.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1_s94ud6Qg\nIn addition to the reworked name and logo, Don't Nod also unveiled a new website sporting the fresh branding. The site has a community-focused theme, and includes a section where players and fans will be able to upload content related to Don't Nod titles — such as artwork, short stories, and poetry, as well as testimonies and memories of their personal experiences with the company's releases. The company also recently won plaudits for introducing \"work-from-home\" options for its workforce, a move that also opened up further opportunities for remote and satellite employees.\n\"I am very proud of the journey that DON’T NOD has been on over the past 14 years, \" said Don't Nod CEO Oskar Guilbert. \"The company has evolved in many ways with a strong will to lead the way in creating and publishing meaningful entertainment, through original and relatable stories, which empower our talents and players to inspire change, however small.

          "description": "It seems to utilize enemy materials for crafting reagents\nXenoblade Chronicles 3 gem crafting returns, as shown in a new tweet from the game's official Japanese Twitter account.\nEnabled by party member Riku, you'll use items gathered from enemies to create the gems, which can be equipped by characters. Increased attack and recovery power are cited as bonuses so far. For Xenoblade followers, the announcement of a gem system doesn't really come as a shock — unless it's a shock in the sense that you're paralyzed by the fear of having to go through this system again.\nGems (not just in this series, but in general JRPG-dom) are polarizing, to say the least, as some involve a laborious amount of grinding, or some form of randomness. Based on what we've seen so far though this Xenoblade Chronicles 3 gem mechanic seems a lot more straightforward. The example shown in the below tweet showcases players crafting a plus attack power gem, using six different ingredients, as well as a coin currency (that serves as an alternative method of crafting gems).\nIt's unknown where coins are acquired in-game, but it could be a sidequest currency of sorts. The three classic roles (defender [blue]/attacker [red]/healer [green]) also seem present, with a fourth category (denoted by a star and an orange gem color) that is possibly a catch-all. It's out...really soon (like a month and a few weeks!) so we'll know soon enough.\nhttps://twitter.com/XenobladeJP/status/1531170715864510464\nThe post Gem crafting is back in Xenoblade Chronicles 3 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The Blue Blur of the Wild\nToday, Sega and IGN premiered a big look at the gameplay of the next Sonic game, Sonic Frontiers. Across seven minutes it shows plenty of rolling around at the speed of sound, but also some strong influence from other open-world games.\nSonic Frontiers is set to be the next big game for Sonic, and it's tackling the open-world genre. In today's footage, it's easy to see some influence from games like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.\nAlongside the literal tower that Sonic starts the clip out climbing, there are also big expanses to roam across. Plus, it seems like more than a few environmental puzzles are in store too.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxJ5_ovBC_g\nAt one point, Sonic runs circles around some flames to unlock a sort-of radar ping. In another, he's walking across blocks in the correct order to light them up, without overlapping his trail. I think it's fairly safe to say this is drawing on some modern open-world conventions.\nPower up the Sonic Cycle\nOne thing we've yet to see is what's tying all this together. Seeing Sonic run around in an open world is one thing, but I'm curious as to what the goals and structure of the game will be. Previous Sonic games usually fall into level-based formats with objectives and structure, but it seems like Sonic can just roam the open world for collectibles and puzzles in Sonic Frontiers.\nThis Sonic Frontiers gameplay is only a first look, though. There's likely more info to come as IGN has Sonic Frontiers as their First feature for the month of June. Hopefully we get a little more info about what sort of enemies, characters, and goals we're dealing with in the wide-open world of Sonic Frontiers soon.\nSonic Frontiers is aiming to launch this year on PC, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch.\nThe post Sonic Frontiers debuts some open-world gameplay and puzzles appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's a no-brainer: I've already downloaded it into my dreams, so I may as well make it official.\nIn reality, this is actually a pair of mods. One of them is a Tifa as Yuna outfit from urbandayz. Another is a Cloud as Tidus costume from Ninjagrime12. With both mods deployed, they work in concert to allow you to live out your FFX fantasy: because of course you know you want to.\nA little housekeeping: so the Cloud as Tidus mod doesn't require much legwork to get going. There's an optional \"Brotherhood over the Buster Sword\" mod that reworks Cloud's weapon into the FFX version from Uploaded by swifferpilled — but you don't need it. On the Tifa side, you will need to consider that you won't be able to see her hands properly as-is. You'll want to apply the \"Tifa Invisible Weapons\" mod from Narknon to smooth things over.\nIf you want, you can use the Amano Barret design to remake the whole crew!

          "description": "Ever ready for the next battle\nBandai Namco's foremost fighting title, Tekken 7, has smashed its way to an amazing nine million sales. The impressive number was revealed by Tekken producer Katsuhiro Harada on Twitter this morning — the eve of the fifth anniversary of the face smasher's home release.\nOriginally launching in Japanese arcades way back in 2015, it took two long years for the latest King of Iron Fist Tournament to make its way to PC and console platforms — by which point it had already seen a revamp in the form of 2016's Tekken 7: Fated Retribution. The home port of Tekken 7 was an immediate success when it finally hit the scene on June 2, 2017, and would go on to receive a slew of new characters, stages, modes, and exciting guest stars.\nClearly, Tekken 7 is still pulling in the punters, having sold a further million copies since we last checked in on its sales figures back in November 2021. With a fresh season of fighting game tournaments on the horizon, it looks like Jin Kazama, Nina Williams, Yoshimitsu, and the rest of the Tekken clan are not ready to bow out just yet. And why not? After all, it's a really rad game, and one of the premier titles in the current fighting game scene. With this milestone, the Tekken franchise has now shifted over 53 million copies since its inception, way back in 1994.\nTekken 7 is available now on PS4, PC, and Xbox One. Virtua Fighter 5 fans should note that Tekken-themed costume DLC will be dropping in Virtua Fighter 5: Ultimate Showdown today, June 1.\nhttps://twitter.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1531893312306683905?s=20&t=9zSUhISTU8hycAUZnkCHqw\n \nThe post Tekken 7 smashes mighty nine million sales milestone appeared first on Destructoid.",

Seeing John Madden's friendly face was actually the reason why I picked up the series in the first place on the SNES, and he's making a comeback for the Madden NFL 23 cover for the first time in a long time.\nFrom 1988 until the year 2000 (when Eddie George kicked off the tradition of players on covers), John Madden himself adorned the cover of the series (from 2000-2005, Madden was present as a little sticker-like logo). After that, the \"Madden curse\" and the hype of who would be the next star athlete to appear was the next big thing, and became a given: until Madden NFL 23.\nThis year, EA is doing something a little differently. This morning, the publisher unveiled the cover (which is \"three unique covers\"), and it's none other than John Madden himself. Artist Chuck Styles, who did the digital art for the Madden NFL 23 cover(s), had the following to say about Madden's legacy: “As someone who grew up loving football, playing in the suburbs of West Philly, it’s a full circle moment to now be able to contribute to the culture of the sport by honoring an icon like John Madden, who has influenced generations of football fans through his passion for football and unmistakable energy, through my art.\"\nEA has also dubbed June 1 \"Madden Day,\" announced remastered audio of Madden for the game, a Madden mode (with two versions of Madden coaching \"All Madden Athletes\" in the 1970s), and have dedicated the EA HQ Redwood football field as \"John Madden Field,\" with Madden family members in attendance. \"More ways EA is honoring John Madden will be announced in the coming weeks.\" It's a 'lotta Madden!\n\nThe post John Madden returns to the cover of Madden NFL 23 for the first time in decades appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "He's been working on the series in some capacity since Game Freak's inception\nGame Freak co-founder Junichi Masuda has been with the company since the start, but is now departing for another predominantly Pokemon-flavored role: \"Chief Creative Fellow\" at The Pokemon Company.\nThe news was announced today, as the industry veteran, composer, director, producer, and designer is bringing his talents to the overarching joint firm that oversees the entire Pokemon franchise. Here is Masuda's full statement on the move, provided in both Japanese and English on The Pokemon Company's official site:\n\"I have served as the director of the Pokemon video game series, starting with 'Pokemon Ruby Version and Pokemon Sapphire Version' up until 'Pokemon X and Pokemon Y,' and was involved in the development of many video games, including Pokemon Go. I would like to express my heart-felt thanks to all Pokemon fans. Going forward, I hope to transcend the boundaries of video games by trying to offer greater surprises, fun and excitement to people all over the world, while doing my utmost to connect people, expand the circle of 'play' and to help bring about a richer world for us to share. I appreciate your continued support in my new role.\"\n\nLike several other big moves lately in the Japanese game industry, this wasn't as sudden as it seems. Following Pokemon Let's Go, Junichi Masuda decided to take a backseat from heading up core Pokemon titles in favor of passing the torch to a new generation.\nAs for what he's doing next: well, the corporate speak didn't help! \"Transcending the boundaries of video games\" sounds vaguely like a mission statement from a Metaverse-focused studio, but given how weird The Pokemon Company has gotten lately, it could be more stuff like the tooth-brushing app. He also, of course, will still be involved with the franchise directly via his new role.\n[Image source]\nThe post Game Freak co-founder Junichi Masuda leaves studio for role at Pokemon Company appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Over 30 major companies in attendance\nAnd with the arrival of June, comes the road to E3 — or, as we call it these days, \"Geoff Keighley and his mates advertizin' stuff.\" With yet another absence form filled in by the Electronic Entertainment Expo, the spotlight falls on the Summer Game Fest, a seemingly endless showcase of publisher wares that will roll out over those hot summer nights.\nYesterday, Mr. Keighley got the hype machine in gear with a brand new post on Twitter, spotlighting 30 of the larger partner companies that will be taking part in this year's event. The whole gang is present and accounted for, with a who's who list that includes 2K Games, Bandai Namco, Capcom, Bloober Team, Activision Blizzard, Sega, Square Enix, Skybound, Devolver Digital, Dotemu, Epic Games, and many, many more. In fact, there are very few major publishers not featured in the splash image... save, of course, for Nintendo — notoriously standoffish when it comes to playing with others.\nThe core of the Summer Game Fest showcase is set to take place between June 9-12, via a selection of live streams, online presentations, social media reveals, and exceedingly long days for your friends at Destructoid and other gaming outlets. This will not suffice, however, as players can expect news, reveals, trailers, and other surprises throughout the summer months.\nThe action kicks off tomorrow, June 2, as Sony hosts its first State of Play stream of the new season. Be sure to tune in at 15:00 PT / 18:00 ET / 23:00 BST for 30 minutes of news and headlines pertaining to all things PlayStation. Of course, over the course of this summer, we will be working tirelessly to bring you all of the pertinent details regarding all of the hottest scoops right here on Destructoid.\nWho will survive and what will be left of them?\nhttps://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1531666856989237253?s=20&t=yHz5BzozfwFlvv6Sm52jjw\nThe post Who will bring the noise at Summer Game Fest 2022? appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "On the road again\nI may not buy much merch from Good Smile Company these days, but showing up to see which video game characters have been immortalized as stylish figures is a fun pastime. How will they be represented in Nendoroid form, and what are the accessories? I like to poke around. In the case of this 30th Anniversary Nendoroid Kirby, it's all about the faces.\nAfter three decades of powerful pink puff action, there's this cutie (via Siliconera):\nhttps://twitter.com/GoodSmile_US/status/1531474322514186240\nNendoroid Kirby: 30th Anniversary Edition comes with accessories like a bindle (the lore of the Kirby series never ceases to amaze me), a sweet potato, a heart, and a Star Rod.\nYou can do a face-off, too — Kirby's starry-eyed look is a fine default, but there's also \"spiral eyes,\" \"a flustered face,\" and my favorite, the \"retro face.\" Kirby looks so determined! Much like plump Pikachu, it's fun to reflect on how character designs have shifted over the years. Come to think of it, Kirby's retro face smile reminds me of a Mii.\nThe 30th anniversary Nendoroid Kirby costs $47.99 with an estimated ship date of February 2023, so consider this a present to your future self — how surprised will you be when you bust open the box next year? Pre-orders are open today through July 13, 2022.\nAnother goodie caught my eye on Good Smile's shop page: a \"nap pillow\" plush of Waddle Dee that's shaped like a loaf of bread. \"I have no mouth, and I must scream,\" indeed.\n30 years of pleasant platforming\nIn August, the Kirby series will continue its celebration with an anniversary concert at Tokyo Garden Theater. It's been a long and generally pleasant journey, hasn't it?\n1996's mind-blowing Kirby Super Star and this year's Kirby and the Forgotten Land are at the top of my list. (Granted, I've missed a lot, but it's hard to imagine anything else resonating with me on this level; both games were a \"right place, right time\" sorta deal.)\nThe post 30th Anniversary Nendoroid Kirby has some real good faces appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "He's out as of May 31\nAfter serving Square Enix for over two decades in multiple roles, Shinji Hashimoto has left the company to retire from the industry altogether.\nHe announced the news directly on his Twitter account (posing with a Chocobo plush), noting that he will retire on May 31 of this year, and will continue to support the company as a fan. Directly following the tweet, Masahiro Sakurai reached out to thank him for his contributions to the field. 2021 was a prelude of sorts to this move, as he stepped down as executive director from the company to focus on other roles.\nWhile Shinji Hashimoto isn't as high-profile as some other members of the Square Enix collective, odds are you've played a game he's worked on extensively, or read heaps of news that involved him indirectly. He was one of the first-ever people to comment on a remake of Final Fantasy VII over a decade ago, and has worked on games from Chocobo Dungeon to Kingdom Hearts III (a series that he in part is responsible for the creation of).\nHe was also famous for giving biting commentary when asked questions by fans and games writers alike; especially when he was quizzed about bringing back old franchises. Even if he said something people may not want to hear, he was a refreshing change of pace from the typically guarded executive part of the industry in the modern era. I hope he enjoys his retirement, and it'll be fascinating to see where Square Enix goes next, and how they intend to fill his shoes.\nThe post Long time Final Fantasy producer Shinji Hashimoto retires from Square Enix appeared first on Destructoid.",

A team of archivists, engineers, and researchers has been assigned to source, grow, and ensure the safekeeping of the archive's contents.\nWhile there are currently no plans to open the archive as a public viewing gallery, Embracer Group plans to allow access to researchers and academics as a record of the artistic, technological, and design history of our favorite pastime. In time, Embracer may make the archive available for public perusal in the form of satellite exhibitions, but for now, it appears that the team is concentrating on the sourcing and collecting of items to further expand upon its impressive catalog.\nIn an increasingly digital world, any form of games preservation is becoming increasingly important, and while it's just as essential that private collectors the world over continue to gather relics from gaming's 50-year history, Embracer Group has the finance and resources to locate, purchase, curate, and maintain the condition of an artistic and innovate history often overlooked by mainstream museums.\nYou can read more about the Embracer Games Archive over on its official website.\nThe post Embracer Group announces formation of new games preservation archive appeared first on Destructoid.",

Soon enough, subscribers will be able to nab the original version of Super Meat Boy, as well as another gem from the Xbox Live Arcade era, Raskulls, and two city-builders: Aven Colony (from 2017) and Project Highrise (from 2018).\nFor June 2022, Xbox Games with Gold is giving out four free games:\nAven Colony (June 1–30)\nProject Highrise: Architect’s Edition (June 16–July 15)\nSuper Meat Boy (June 1–15)\nRaskulls (June 16–30)\nWith an active Xbox Live Gold or Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription, you can redeem these games during those listed time frames, then keep 'em for good.\nMany of us have been there and back again with Super Meat Boy — a true test of determination just as much as platforming reflexes. It's one of those greats in its genre, and this is the original Xbox Live Arcade edition, so grab your headphones and crank it up.\n[caption id=\"attachment_324647\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1920\"] Aven Colony.[/caption]\nThe other throwback for June is Raskulls, a frantic action-platformer that's notable around here for its sharp-dressed Mr. Destrctoid cameo, while Aven Colony and Project Highrise are a bit newer (but not exactly \"fresh\"). The former is a city-builder with drones and aliens, while the latter is going for a more squished SimTower vibe. Not a bad spread!\nMore games to check out sooner than later\nSome of the May selections, including Viva Piñata Party Animals, are still claimable.\nWhile we're talking about what's coming and going, there's also an update on Xbox Game Pass, with highlights like Ninja Gaiden: Master Collection on June 2, and Assassin's Creed Origins, Chorus, and Disc Room on June 7.

The crew revealed it as Air Twister today, and its trailer is a pretty fun way to kick off the summer of video game news.\nThe trailer kicks off with death and destruction, as infantry riding giant birds fight in battle against robots. The protagonist, Princess Arch, mourns a swan before taking off and leaping the trailer into a vastly different tone.\nSuddenly it's showing gameplay, with a Killer Queen-sound-alike blasting in the background. It is truly incredible.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1A5WJ2YFVc\nAccording to the App Store page, Air Twister is an endless shooter. Players move around the screen using swipe movements and blast enemies out of the sky. There are 12 stages, over 20 different enemies and 10 unique bosses, Stars to collect and global rankings to chase.\nSuzuki is apparently hesitant to call this a Space Harrier successor though. In a briefing (via GameSpot) Suzuki said he's always had this idea for a fantasy shooting game, but the limited available tech ended up leading to Space Harrier. With 2022's tech, he's made Air Twister, which he calls his \"ideal fantasy shooting game.\"\n\nThe golden goose\nThe last game we saw from Suzuki and YS Net was Shenmue III, the latest entry in the Shenmue series that felt like a time capsule. Seeing the team turn its efforts towards mobile is an interesting move. But one that clearly makes an impression. Yes, I'm surprised by the fantasy shooter with geese, spacesuits, lasers, and robots. I can't say I'm not intrigued to see what it becomes, though.\nThose interested won't need to wait long, either. Air Twister hits Apple Arcade on June 24. Alongside it are a few other releases for the mobile gaming platform. Frogger and the Rumbling Ruins sets off on June 3, and Cooking Mama: Cuisine! lands on June 17.\nThe post Yu Suzuki and YS Net reveal Air Twister with an absolutely wild trailer appeared first on Destructoid.",

In support of LGBTQIA+ communities, Microsoft will be donating money to charity, selling a new controller design, and more to celebrate.\nStarting on June 9, the faceplate design you see above will be available in the Xbox Design Lab as a customization option through the end of the month. Inspired by Pride, the faceplate incorporates 34 flags representing different LGBTQIA+ groups. Xbox has put together a site highlighting each flag on the controller. Because this is an Xbox Design Lab promotion, and in the spirit of diversity, you can freely customize the rest of the controller like you would with any other product in the Design Lab, including colors for grips, triggers, d-pad, analog sticks, and but…",

          "description": "Variety reported last year that a Twisted Metal series was on the way from the writers of Deadpool, and then we later learned the show will debut on Peacock. \nAnthony Mackie, perhaps best known as Falcon in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (although he does have a new role in it now), was cast as the series’ star last September and now we know who will be playing the most iconic character from the Twisted Metal franchise, Sweet Tooth. It will be none other than Will Arnett, the voice of Batman in The Lego Batman Movie and the titular character in Bojack Horseman. \nThis news comes by way of Variety, which reports that Arnett will “voice” Sweet Tooth, which kind of makes it sound like Sweet Tooth will either be a CGI character or the person acting as Sweet Tooth won’t be voicing him. Or, of course, perhaps Arnett will play Sweet Tooth on set, too, while also voicing him in post-production, given the whole head-on-fire part of the character. Variety reports that the show’s Sweet Tooth is “described as a hilarious and terrifying hulk of a man, who is as emotional as he is cunning,” and a “lover of chaos.”\n“[This] majestic rage-filled killer dons an ever-smiling clown mask and uses ‘Lost Vegas’ as his own personal kill-ground, all while he drives his infamous doomsday ice cream truck,” Variety writes.\nThe publication reports that Arnett was long-rumored for this role in addition to working as an executive producer for the show. Arnett joins Mackie, Stephanie Beatriz (Encanto, Brooklyn 99), Thomas Haden Church (Spider-Man 3), and Neve Campbell (the Scream franchise) in this series. \n[Source: Variety]\nAre you excited about this Twisted Metal series?

          "description": "Yesterday, Sega debuted roughly 30 seconds of Sonic Frontiers open-world gameplay and today, you can now watch more than seven minutes of gameplay, courtesy of IGN. It’s basically an extended look at what was showcased yesterday and it looks great. \nRight off the bat, it’s beautiful – looking more realistic than any Sonic game before, too – and it’s clear that speed is the name of the game because there’s virtually nothing in the way of stopping the Blue Blur. It’s cliche to say, but it looks like if you see something in the distance, there’s a way for you to speed all the way over there, be it by rail, ramp, on ground, or something else. Take a look for yourself below:\n\n\nAs you can see, running isn’t all that’s in this extended gameplay look. There are plenty of Sonic staples, like on-ground boosts, bumpers, and more. Plus, there are towers that act as platforming challenges, tasking you with reaching the top. Elsewhere, there are simple puzzles to solve that involve stepping on lit switches as well as a speed wheel (think: hamster wheel, or hedgehog wheel, I suppose) that seems to do something to the surrounding area. Maybe it defogs a map, or unlocks new areas to explore. Only time will tell for now. \nUnfortunately, we don’t yet have a release date for Sonic Frontiers, but it’s coming sometime this year, so hopefully we don’t have to wait too much longer. While waiting to learn more, check out this trailer from last December, and then check out this other snippet of Sonic Frontiers gameplay that debuted yesterday. \nWhat do you think of this gameplay?

On that day, you'll be able to choose between the three starters: Fuecoco, Sprigatito, and Quaxly. They will likely be given to you by the new professors (yes, plural) of Generation 9: Professor Sada if you're playing Scarlet (left) and Professor Turo if you're playing Violet (right).\nYou can check them out in action in the trailer below:\n\n\nShortly after their introduction, the trailer reveals that four-player co-op will be in Scarlet and Violet, a first for the Pokémon series. It won't be limited to just online battles like in previous games, though – it seems we'll be able to explore the region with other players. Throughout the trailer, we get glimpses at returning favorites and new Pokémon, such as Pawmi, Lechonk (great name), and Smoliv.\nPlus, we see what appears to be some very Pokémon Legends: Arceus-style sleuthing and monster catching too. \nThe trailer concludes with the reveal of this generation's two primary legendaries: Karaidon, the red dragon-looking Pokémon that will reside on the box art of Scarlet, and Maraidon, the purple dragon-looking Pokémon that will reside on the box art for Violet. Both appear to live off the coast of this region, high atop some cliffs in the ocean. \n\nFor more about Pokémon Violet and Scarlet, watch the original reveal trailer, which includes a nice look at this gen's starters, and then check out our living list of every Pokémon in these games confirmed so far.

Before this update, you simply could not – the console would let you know an achievement was secret, but you’d have to search online elsewhere to determine its objective. Starting this month, you can choose to reveal secret achievements, according to a new Xbox Wire blog post, as reported by IGN. \n“If you don’t mind spoilers or want a hint on any of the achievements in the games you’re playing, it’s easy to find the secret achievement details on your Xbox,” the blog post reads. “From within a game, open the guide and go to Game Activity > Achievements. When you see a secret achievement, you can now reveal details like the title, achievement description, and Gamerscore. And after you peek, you can go back and hide it or continue to display the details. \n“You can reveal secret achievements anywhere you like to play and track your achievements from Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One consoles, the Xbox app for Android and iOS, the Xbox app for Windows PC, and Game Bar on your PC.” \nHere’s a look at how it works: \nWhile waiting for this update to download, read about how Xbox and Bethesda are hosting a games showcase next week, and then check out Game Informer’s in-house predictions for that showcase after that. \n[Source: IGN]\nAre you excited about this update?

It was originally supposed to drop last year, but it instead became a 2022 title, with a new trailer debuting at The Game Awards 2021. Now, as we anticipate the Blue Blur’s 3D return sometime this year, Sega has released a new teaser trailer that gives us just a taste of Sonic’s first open-world foray, and it looks awesome. \nThis new teaser comes by way of the official Sonic the Hedgehog Twitter account, which released the trailer alongside news that Sonic Frontiers is getting the IGN First treatment in June. In fact, according to the tweet, we’ll be getting some world-exclusive reveals very soon, which, if this teaser trailer is anything to go off of, means we’ll probably be getting some extended looks at gameplay in June. For now, the teaser trailer below will have to do: \n\n\nAs you can see in the trailer, there’s a lot going on in just this quick 30-second glimpse. There’s plenty of full-speed, open-world running, lots of rails to grind on, enemies to destroy, and it appears there are even tower-like checkpoints to activate or interact with. I’d wager you have to do this to open up more of the game’s open-world map, but that’s just a guess for now. Hopefully, we will learn more soon. \nWhat do you think of this gameplay teaser?

Developer Stunlock Studios revealed that the game has pushed past 1.5 million copies sold in only two weeks.\nStunlock doesn’t provide an exact sales number, but 1.5 million+ is a remarkable feat for a game technically in its infancy. V Rising has been popular on Twitch and has garnered strong reviews thus far. The game puts you in the undead boots of a newly awakened vampire who must build their empire. Similar to games like Valheim, players explore an open world in search of resources (either from nature itself or by pillaging villages) to construct a castle and become the second coming of Dracula. Combat pushes you to use your supernatural abilities to take down a host of otherworldly creatures, and you can tackle the game alongside friends in co-op. You can also attack other players’ castles in PvP. \n\n\nAs an Early Access title, V Rising will continue to receive updates and improvements over the next several months. The game’s Steam page states that Stunlock hopes to launch the game in 1.0 within the next 12 months, barring any changes.",

However, a lesser-known series that's produced some under-the-radar experiences is returning. Romancing SaGa: Minstrel Song Remastered is launching on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, PC, and iOS and Android devices this winter. \nThe instruments change, but 30 years later the melody remains the same.\npic.twitter.com/Y6D48xDK9O\nMay 31, 2022\nMinstrel Song dropped exclusively on PlayStation 2 in 2005. The updated visuals (changed from bit art to 3D) don't do much to improve the very bizarre character designs, but fans of the series that never got to play it more than a decade ago will finally get to test their skills with the game's combat and class systems. \nMinstrel Song itself is a remake of the original Romancing SaGa game released on the Super Famicom in 1992. The narrative follows eight adventurers as they try to stop the resurgence of an ancient deity of darkness. \nThe Game Informer archives reveal that Joe Juba gave Romancing SaGa a 5 out of 10 and said that the game vied for the worst RPG of the year. Hopefully, the remaster gives it a second lease on life. Romancing SaGa: Minstrel Song Remastered drops on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, PC, and mobile devices later this year.",

Fortnite’s cartoonish aesthetic and enticing crossovers scratched my casual FPS itch, but the base-building mechanic constantly shattered combat momentum.

That’s because in the canonized novel Star Wars: Brotherhood, which is about the relationship between Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi, a reference to Blitzball being played in a local lake is made. How do we know it’s the Blitzball from Final Fantasy X? Well, the author of Brotherhood, Mike Chen, is the person who revealed this fun detail, as reported by GamesRadar. \n#6: There's a reference to a sport called Blitzball played in a local lake. Blitzball is basically underwater hockey played as a minigame in Final Fantasy X. As a former NHL writer, I freaking loved Blitzball and spent hours winning leagues. pic.twitter.com/uad4uIMcrA\nMay 17, 2022\nAs you can see, it seems Chen was a big enough fan of the sport that he included a reference to it in his canon Star Wars novel. Does someone have a lightsaber that looks like Caladbolg, though? \nIf you’re interested in other Brotherhood easter eggs such as this, Chen has an entire thread dedicated to them on Twitter. \nFor more about Star Wars, watch the new trailer for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, which is the sequel to Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, and then watch this new Star Wars: The Bad Batch Season 2 trailer.

This category features games where two groups face each other, but each side has unique, sometimes wildly disproportionate, skills and goals. As evidenced by many of the year’s recently released and upcoming titles, like Evil Dead: The Game, IllFonic’s Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleased, and Dragon Ball: The Breakers, the genre is seeing a resurgence. There’s no shortage of asymmetrical games you can jump into right now if you want to hone your skills or build up anticipation for soon-to-be-released titles.\n  \n\n\n\n      \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nDead by Daylight\nPlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, Stadia, PC, iOS, Android\nIt’s hard to talk asymmetrical multip…",

With a look at Gungi, we now know that he survived Order 66, which sought to kill and end the entirety of the Jedi. The trailer also reveals that we can expect Season 2 of The Bad Batch to drop onto Disney+ this fall. \n\n\nAs you can see in the trailer above, the titular Bad Batch of heroes are still doing their thing, searching for what they want to do now that they’re free. Of course, meanwhile, Sheev Palpatine’s empire is on the rise and the crew will need to deal with that while extending their helping hands to others. It looks like they’re after new allies, too, which hopefully includes Gungi. \nFor more about Star Wars, read about the newly announced series, Star Wars: Skeleton Crew, which will star Jude Law, and then read about how the Rogue One prequel series, Andor, will hit Disney+ in August. After that, check out the first ever Star Wars Jedi: Survivor trailer. \nAre you excited for Season 2 of Star Wars: The Bad Batch? Let us know in the comments below!",

          "description": "Everyone has that Elden Ring boss they really enjoyed facing off against, even if they kicked your butt over and over again, including the game’s director and From Software CEO Hidetaka Miyazaki. \nHis favorite boss is Starscourge Radahn, according to a new Xbox Wire Japan blog post, as translated by IGN. As for why, the famed director cites Radahn’s alluring design as a character in The Lands Between as well as the festival surrounding him. \n\n\n“It’s tough to decide, but I’d have to say Radahn,” Miyazaki said. “As an individual character, he’s really alluring, and I really like the Radahn Festival situation. There’s a literal sense of festivity and exuberance, but also a unique tinge of sadness and loneliness.” \nHe said when he first brought up the idea of Radahn and his festival, “no one on the team took it seriously,” which is extra funny considering this boss is Miyazaki’s favorite. He added that his next favorite bosses after Radahn are Godrick, the Grafted and Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy. He also said one of his favorite designs out of anything in the game is the 12-fingered Caria Manor hand spiders, because of course (they still give me the heebie-jeebies). \n“Spider Hand is one of my favorite designs,” Miyazaki said in the Xbox Wire Japan post. “It’s something you don’t want to even look at because it’s so horrible. I wonder if the way to overcome your issue is to face it head on and beat it.” \n\n\nI was more of a “oohp, there’s one of those hand spider things so I’m going to turn around now” kind of player. \nFor more, read about this Elden Ring mod that lets you party up with NPCs and bosses like Malenia and then check out Game Informer’s Elden Ring review to find out why we gave it a 10 out of 10.

In the original Splatoon, pop duo Callie and Marie (AKA the Squid Sisters) ran down the news at the start of each play session, while Splatoon 2 introduced us to Pearl and Marina (AKA Off The Hook).

Its 20+ year history began after series creator Hideki Kaimya attempted to create an installment of another legendary Capcom series, and instead birthed the prototype of the modern character action game (or \"Stylish Action\"). In this new season, we'll be covering the development and devilish narratives of all of the DMC titles, including Ninja Theory's reboot.

Here's the complete list of games we'll be talking about in the coming weeks:\nDevil May Cry\nDevil May Cry 2\nDevil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening\nDevil May Cry 4\nDmC: Devil May Cry\nDevil May Cry 5\nVideo Gameography is a podcast hosted by Game Informer Associate Editors Marcus Stewart and John Carson. Each season is a deep dive into a specific video game series, with each episode exploring the year of release, development, and narrative for a single game in that storied franchise. We're joined by a special guest every episode to help break down our thoughts on the topic that week and have a few laughs along the way. \nLast season, we broke from the mold established from our Metroid, Halo, Uncharted, and Bioshock seasons by covering the Gameography of a single development studio, Supergiant Games. Check out the episodes for Bastion, Transistor, Pyre, and Hades to catch up on the show before we initiate our Devil Trigger and take a stab at Devil May Cry. \nListen and subscribe to Video Gameography on your favorite podcast service.

This role-playing game was originally released on Xbox in 2004 and later found its way to PC. You'll now have the chance to play it again on your TV or take it on the go on Switch for just $15.\nThe Sith Lords is set during a dark period for the Republic. As a Jedi in exile, you could bring stability to the Jedi Order and help the Republic, or embrace the dark side of the Force and help a new order take command. This sequel embraces player choice in meaningful and fun ways, allowing you to form tight bonds with your teammates and pick how you wield the Force.\nWe recently ranked The Sith Lords as the fifth best Star Wars game in our Top 30 Star Wars Games list, saying \"Although development switched studios from BioWare to Obsidian Entertainment, the choice-driven bliss of the original Knights of the Old Republic RPG is alive and well in Sith Lords. Picking up five years after the fall of Lord Malak, the Sith Lords is another finely penned tale that offers deeper dialogue options, another great cast of characters, and plenty of alignment-specific variables.\"",

Now all we need is a smaller set that gives us a Cal Kestis minifigure. The BD-1 set retails for $99.99.

The latest Star Wars collectible announced introduces a new character, and it's unlike anything we've seen in the Star Wars universe. This odd companion appears to be this year's Grogu, and will be turned into a variety of collectibles that will be released this holiday season.\nThese announcements were made today by toy manufacturer Hasbro, and happened during Star Wars Celebration, a four-day event held in Anaheim, Calif.\nThe trailers for Obi-Wan Kenobi implied Old Ben would be keeping an eye on Luke Skywalker, but the show is more about his sister at this point. When we first meet Leia, we see she has a companion droid named LOLA (L0-LA59). This tiny, hovering droid is transforming into three different collectibles, one offering functionality that mimics the movements and sounds from the show.\nHasbro's animatronic edition features a touch sensor on LOLA's head that can activate over 45 different light, sound, and movement options. This version retails for $89.99 and will be released in the fall.\nHasbro's second LOLA offering is an interactive electronic figure that also offers lights and sounds, but lacks the movements. This figure is highly poseable, however, allowing for the panels on LOLA's back to be positioned in different ways. This figure releases this summer for $39.99.\nHasbro's final announcement ties in with the Grogu Bounty Collection. You can add two small LOLA toys to your shelves, each showing off the droid's personality in different ways. This series of figures will be joined by other figures based on R2-D2, BD-1, and Grogu. Hasbro is targeting a fall release for them.",

A passionate group of fans has long pleaded with developer Valve to address the issue, and the company has finally responded. \nYesterday, the official Team Fortress 2 Twitter account posted a message in response to #SaveTF2, a peaceful campaign of fans working to raise awareness about the game’s rampant bot problem. Basically, bot programs have made the game nearly unplayable for some since they’ll instantly kill players upon loading up into match-ups, giving the bots users an unfair advantage. TF2 players have become increasingly vocal about the problem, but Valve has remained largely silent on the issue (even going quiet on the game’s forums) until posting the following message: \nTF2 community, we hear you! We love this game and know you do, too. We see how large this issue has become and are working to improve things.\nMay 26, 2022\nValve doesn’t elaborate on how it plans to tackle the problem or when to expect a solution but getting the notoriously quiet company to respond is an accomplishment and measure of relief for Team Fortress 2 fans. Hopefully, it results in a substantial response that comes sooner rather than later.",

          "description": "A not-so-long time ago in the same galaxy we all reside in, Respawn Entertainment deviated from its first-person shooter roots to create Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66. After he’s outed by the Sith, he embarks on a quest to recover an artifact capable of locating force-sensitive children while also avoiding capture by the Inquisitors, who are elite Jedi hunters. \nThe game features a blend of lightsaber combat and a suite of Force abilities. Borrowing inspiration from FromSoftware’s Soul series, encounters are challenging, requiring a strategic blend of blocks and parries to outduel opponents. Meanwhile, the various planets take on a Metroid-inspired progression with players unlocking abilities to backtrack to previously inaccessible areas. \nWatch on Twitch!\nFallen Order was released on November 15, 2019, and was a critical and financial success. It also served as a saving grace for single-player fans, providing proof to an increasingly multiplayer-focused EA that linear story-driven experiences can still make the big bucks. With a sequel reportedly in the works, we’re revisiting this gem of the Star Wars video game pantheon. \nJoin Marcus Stewart, Andrew Reiner, and John Carson on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central as we journey through the entirety of Cal Kestis’ adventure. Expect plenty of laughs, deaths, and general nerding out over all things Star Wars. We encourage you to hang out with us in chat.

          "description": "When Jurassic World: Dominion opens in theaters in two weeks, we’ll see what happens when dinosaurs walk among us. Odds are most humans will be turned into tasty dinosaur snacks, but we probably won’t go down without a fight. Jurassic World Evolution 2 players can download a new expansion that adds some of the movie’s new dinosaurs to their parks on the same day. The Dominion Biosyn expansion adds the Gigantosaurus, Dreadnoughtus, Pyroraptor, Quetzalcoatlus, Therizinosaurus, and the long-overdue Dimetrodon.\nThe Gigantosaurs’ behavior in Dominion is apparently modeled after The Dark Knight’s Joker. This odd inspiration point was revealed by the movie’s director Colin Trevorrow in an interview with Empire Magazine. “I wanted something that felt like the Joker,” he said. “It just wants to watch the world burn.” We’ll have to wait to see just how much of that destructive quality comes out in the game’s version of the beast.\nThe arrival of dinosaurs is just a tiny part of this expansion, which offers a new ‘what if’ campaign inspired by the forthcoming motion picture. This campaign allows players to add new buildings to their parks, as well as a variety of new species, some of which are feathered. Existing dinosaurs will also get new skins. The new story unfolds through a variety of characters, including Claire Dearing (voiced by Bryce Dallas Howard), Dr. Alan Grant (voiced by Sam Neill), Dr. Ellie Sattler (voiced by Laura Dern), and Lewis Dodgson (voiced by Campbell Scott).\nOther new features for the park include an underground Hyper Loop transportation network, invisible fences, and new vehicles and decorations. All of it can be used in the Sandbox.\nFrontier Developments calls this expansion its biggest yet, and it’s slated to release on June 14.",

          "description": "Sony has announced a new State of Play scheduled to air next Thursday, June 2 at 3 p.m. Pacific/6 p.m. Eastern. \nThe PlayStation Blog states the event will run for 30 minutes and showcases “exciting reveals from our third-party partners.” The post doesn’t mention first-party at all, so it sounds like we shouldn’t expect updates on games like God of War: Ragnarok, Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, or the rumored remake of The Last of Us.\nSony also teases that viewers will get a “sneak peek” into PlayStation VR2 games. Just yesterday it was confirmed the headset will launch with over 20 games. The only announced title is Horizon: Call of the Wild, though that project may not appear if the event is highlighting third parties. At that point, it’s anyone’s guess as to what PS VR2 software we’ll see.\nThe last State of Play took place in March, which brought the reveals of games like Valkyrie Elysium, Exoprimal, and Gundam Evolution. Given that this could be Sony’s only real presence during June’s onslaught of game showcases, it hopefully has some heavy-hitters, even if they won’t be coming from its first-party studios. \nWe recently shared our own predictions on PlayStation reveals this summer during this week’s Game Informer Show podcast.

As of today, that’s no longer the case.\nGlen Schofield, The Callisto Protocol’s creative director, took to Twitter to announce that the game now unfolds within its own story and fiction and not PUBG’s. \nFYI @CallistoTheGame is its own story and world.

          "description": "A few days ago, Google announced the list of students accepted for this year's Google Summer of Code.\nWe are very proud to welcome 4 students this year who will be working on various parts of the project during the upcoming months.\nPragyansh Chaturvedi (aka Raikou) will work on improving our DIRECTOR engine. His effort will help us to allow support for many 90s-era adventure games made with the Macromedia Director authoring tools. By implementing more internal functions used by DIRECTOR, Pragyansh's main objective is to extend support for Meet Mediaband and The Journeyman Project (Win and Mac), making them fully playable without any glitches.\nMichael Hayman (aka Quote58) is about to implement support for The Immortal. The game (released in 1990) can be described as a mix of genres involving RPG elements with action and puzzles. Many changes across different game variants (written in pure assembly code!) will make this an interesting challenge. This project is a continuation of a GSoC task initially started by a former student back in 2018.\nEmanuele Grisenti (aka grisenti) will be working on a new engine, HPL1. The original sources for this engine got recently released by the original developer Frictional Games under GPLv3. The purpose of this project is to achieve a full port of this engine to ScummVM, with the goal of supporting the 2007 survival game Penumbra: Overture.\nAvijeet Maurya (aka StableSteady) will pick up several incomplete engines: MacVenture, Avalanche, Glk-Scott, Pink and WAGE. Some of these engines are very close to completion, but not quite there yet. The main objective of Avijeet's task is to identify all missing features and fix existing bugs. The goal for his project is to bring the above engines to a stable state.\nThe team is very excited about the upcoming weeks – and we hope you are as well.\nPlease give a warm welcome to our new students! Let's make GSoC 2022 a huge success – together!\n>",
