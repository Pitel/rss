          "description": "At least €60 a share is its target.\nWith ongoing consolidation occurring within the gaming industry, rumours of a potential Ubisoft sale continue to persist. Although the most recent reports suggest that the company is looking to block potential takeovers with a partnership of their own, the latest report suggests that Ubisoft may in fact be holding off until its share price increases.\nAccording to Dealreporter (via GameIndustry.biz), the Assassin's Creed publisher is looking for its share price to reach at €60 to €70 before it considers any kind of buyout. Looking at a best-case scenario, it's been suggested that a share price of €100 would be the optimum level due to its long-term prospects.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Japanese book publisher Kodansha will be releasing an encyclopedia that encompasses all 235 species of insects, fish, deep-sea creatures, and fossils.

On 1st June, as a reminder, Knockout City will be going free-to-play; developer Velan Studios (also well known for Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit) will also be parting ways with EA and taking on publishing duties.\nThe same date will also be the launch of season 6 for the game, and it certainly seems like a fresh opportunity for the multiplayer dodgeball extravaganza. We liked it a lot in our review, but there's also the inevitable reality that some of us will have fallen off it, or perhaps played the extensive free trial but then not taken the jump with a purchase. No doubt Velan Studios has looked to the free-to-play successes of games like Rocket League, and of course we also have Fall Guys going free when it arrives on Switch and Xbox on 21st June.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

And along the promotional trail, Reggie Fils-Aimé has been dropping tons of nuggets and thoughts about the company so many still associate him with.\nThe latest stop on his book advertising adventure was with the GeekWire podcast, where Reggie talks about the story behind his book, his time at Nintendo, and the origins of a famous quote. In the second half of the podcast, GeekWire's co-founder and podcast host, Todd Bishop, asks Reggie about Nintendo's approach to online gaming — something which the host admits Microsoft and Sony were much better at investing in — and whether there were any regrets or lessons learned.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

My personal highlight, though, was talking to the Pinny Arcade collectors during the show's official trading event.\r\n\n\r\nI’ll admit, before I went to PAX I didn’t really appreciate how big Pinny Arcade was. I’d definitely seen photos of colourful metal pins depicting characters from various video games fly across my screen as I browsed Twitter, but I had never thought much about them beyond that. I was shocked, then, to arrive at PAX and realise just how integral this collectable is to the show. Merch booths sell starter packs, individual demo stations flog game specific rarities and avid fans adorn their lanyards with their favourite pieces. It turns out, Pinny Arcade is huge. \r\n\n \nRead more",

A killer robot is trying to kill a lady because of something her son will eventually do, that kind of thing. My favourite episodes of Doctor Who, by contrast, were always the ones where the Doctor met a miserable dog-alien thousands of years in the future, and the dog alien is like \"Not only is the planet about to blow, but my marriage is in trouble,\" and then the episode was mostly about the latter issue rather than the former. This is all by way of introduction to Eternal Threads, a puzzle game where you go back in time to stop everyone in a house share dying in a fire. \nTo save a present that has been rendered apocalyptic by time travel itself, you are part of a team who go back and change tiny things in the past to fix it, in this case 2015. While it is imperative for some reason that the fire does indeed happen, it is just as important that all six occupants live. You can alter small decisions they make in the week running up to the fire, and so save their lives by choosing whether they go to the pub, if they comfort each other in times of need, or what they have arguments about. The beat of a butterfly's wing, indeed.\nRead more",

With its late summer release fast approaching, Volition recently showed off a larger chunk of some actual gameplay to press in another remote preview session. It looks almost exactly like what you'd expect it to look like: a fun open world game where you shoot people and smash cars into other cars.\nBarring any catastrophic eventualities where this game actually ends up being just a load of bugs propping up other bugs in a fluorescent trenchcoat, I feel almost 100% confident in saying to you that this will be an enjoyable product when it comes out. But I also should be honest and say that the gameplay I saw has congealed into the same kind of sticky morass and blurred whirling lights in my memory as my first all-night benders. It's a big collage of colours and explosions, and words like \"cops\", \"switch car\" and \"plan\", leaving a general impression of fun but, so far, few specifics in its wake. And to be even more frank about it all, I can't think of a nailed on reason why any of it has to be a Saints Row game.\nRead more",

Vampire: The Masquerade - Swansong has taught me that they actually spend most of their time walking around looking at things, sometimes stopping to have tense conversations or pick up keycards. There is occasional eating.\nThis is probably because the three vampires you play as in Swansong aren't exactly on their down-time. Set in Boston in 2019, you begin in medias res after a sudden violent attack on a party has left the Boston vampire court reeling. The Prince, an Annie Lennox cosplayer called Hazel Iverson, has called three of her most trusted lieutenants in to firstly check on the immediate aftermath, and thereafter investigate the wider fallout and strike against whodunnit. Since developers Big Bad Wolf are the folks behind The Council, the role you take isn't an action hero but different shades of spy and/or detective. Neither leaves you much time to loaf about being all sexy, though. \nRead more",

It’s not the whole story when it comes to new players in the infamous space MMO, but it is the dominant one. \nAmong the many graphs that Finnbogason presented to the Eve faithful during his Fanfest keynote in Reykjavík this year, one was a colourful standout. It showed Eve Online’s learning curve as a comedy cliff face, so steep that it turned back on itself. Stickmen tumbled from its peak, while others were crucified or hanged from the curve’s mantel - killed by Eve’s notoriously cruel new player experience. It earned a laugh of grim recognition from the audience, all survivors of that terrible climb.\nRead more",

I cannot remember any of the rules of poker, but I do really like the feel of cards, the shick schick shick of shuffling them and all the business of moving them around in your hand as if that'll change things very much. Card Shark, the latest game from the Reigns devs Nerial, is an ideal card game for me, as it does all the noises of shuffling and dealing and collecting cards extremely well, without requiring any knowledge or memory of the games its punters are actually playing. \nInstead, Card Shark is all about the palming and stacking and counting of cards, rather than an actual card game like your classic deckbuilders and such like. It will be out in full on June 2nd, but last week I got to play a larger version of the current Steam demo - about four hours worth of it, in fact - and I discovered that while I'm very bad at card games, I am pretty good at (pretend) cheating at them.\nRead more",

          "description": "AMD’s FSR 2.0 upscaler is out now – in only one game, Deathloop, but still. This is a big moment for the heavily upgraded FSR (FidelityFX Super Resolution), as it’s basically attempting to fight Nvidia’s rival DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) with some of its own tactics. There’s none of Nvidia’s machine learning enhancements, but whereas FSR 1.0 was a simple spatial upscaler – meaning data used for upscaling a frame could only come from within the frame itself – FSR 2.0 uses a temporal upscaling technique similar to that of DLSS. This allows it to draw data from previous frames as well, producing a sharper, higher-quality image. \r\n\n\r\nThe lack of machine learning also has the upside of keeping FSR 2.0, like FSR 1.0, compatible with any reasonably recent gaming GPU. Nvidia may make most of this generation’s best graphics cards, but you won't need something brand new and super powerful to let FSR 2.0 boost your frame rates. To find out how well it works, compared to both DLSS and FSR 1.0, I reinstalled Deathloop and gave all three upscalers a whirl.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "The Lego games I'm most familiar with are the licensed property games - yer Lego Indiana Joneses and yer Lego Star Warses where you run around a continuous level smashing things. Lego Bricktales is more akin to last year's extremely cute geometric puzzler Lego Builder's Journey, in that you're exploring detailed, colourful brick dioramas, and solving puzzles by bulding things out of titular hot-property block. In Bricktales, though, it's way more granular. You're whisked away into a separate building screen to construct and stress test things like bridges and beams to support a platform, for example. You have a set number of different shaped and sized bricks to work with.\nFrom playing a preview build of the first level - a jungle, home to some lost explorers - the thing that impresses me most about Bricktales is just how much it's like building things with actual Lego. It sounds stupid to say, but them little bricks are really astonishingly realised. It all looks so much Lego it's sort of surprising that you can't reach through the screen and pick it up. It's amazing. It's the closest thing to Lego you can get outside of actual Lego - which is the problem. It just kind of makes you miss Lego.\nRead more",

          "description": "A glimpse at some gorgeous gameplay while we wait\nWhen Tchia was announced at the Game Awards back in 2020, I immediately added it to my list of beautiful, relaxing games that I'm looking forward to. It's billed on Steam as a \"tropical open-world adventure\" which, as someone who loves all things sand and surf, is enough on its own to get me interested in learning more about the game. All of the other fun adventures the game promises, well, those are just icing on the cake.\nUnfortunately, the game's developer Awaceb just announced that Tchia has been delayed to early 2023, so we're going to have to wait a little bit longer to embark on our tropical adventure. The good news is they did drop off a new mini-feature that highlights a key component of Tchia's gameplay: ocean exploration.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQXFd4jn-mY\nThe short trailer shows clips of the titular character Tchia sailing around gorgeous tide pools, diving into the water in search of lost treasure, and even different customization options for the boat's sails and flags. Of all the open-world games I've played, Tchia looks to be the most relaxed and easy-going, which we can always use more of in an industry of titles focused so heavily on combat.\nThe news of the delay may not be ideal, but it does look like Tchia is going to be worth the wait. On top of the ocean exploration portion of the gameplay, we can also look forward to other fun mechanics like transforming into different animals and objects, climbing and gliding around the oceanside cliffs, and strumming on a fully playable ukulele.\nWe can definitely see the impact of titles like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Super Mario Odyssey in Tchia, and I personally can't wait to see what new spin Awaceb puts on gameplay mechanics that we've come to know and love.\nTchia will be available in early 2023 for PC, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.\nThe post Tchia gets an ocean exploration mini-trailer amidst delay news appeared first on Destructoid.",

The final vote came down 19 for, 3 against.\nThe vote was held today, over a webcast stream. The group, Game Workers Alliance, marks the first union at a major games studio in North America and one of only a few around, including Vodeo Games staff.\nhttps://twitter.com/WeAreGWA/status/1528825165798223872\nIt's a big move, especially as The Washington Post reported that Activision Blizzard management had been discouraging employees from voting in favor of the union. A Bloomberg report from earlier today says that the National Labor Relations Board is preparing an official complaint unless Activision settles. An Activision spokesperson denied the allegations in a statement to Bloomberg.\nA long road\nIt's been a long road for Raven employees, starting with sudden layoffs at the end of last year. Workers at Raven's QA department, which works on titles like Call of Duty: Warzone, held a walkout and eventually went on strike calling for worker representation.\nThe strike ended when the QA testers formed a union, Game Workers Alliance, under the Communication Workers of America. The union called on Activision Blizzard for official recognition.\nActivision Blizzard did recently confirm it would be moving many of its U.S. QA workers to full-time positions. But the company also said it would not voluntarily recognize Raven Software's QA union, leading to today's vote.\nThe publisher has been the subject of acute scrutiny for some time now. A lawsuit filed by the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing kickstarted a series of lawsuits and reports.\nMicrosoft announced earlier this year that it plans to purchase Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion. Microsoft told The Washington Post earlier this year that it would \"not stand in the way\" of an Activision Blizzard union.\nThe post Raven Software QA employees vote to unionize appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The Early Access survival game puts some novel twists on the mold\nI wasn't sure what to make of V Rising in my first hour or so with it. The Steam Early Access survival game starts out just tasking you with making a vampire lord, rising from a coffin, and collecting resources. Crafting, scrapping, and surviving, it all felt familiar.\nYet the isometric world and grim, gothic setting kept giving me more and more Diablo vibes. Soon I had a castle and heart, some weapons and spells to work with, and a domain to call my own. And soon, I'd go on the hunt, and really see where V Rising would set itself apart for me. After putting in a handful of hours with V Rising over the weekend, I can absolutely see why players are so excited about its prospects.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7KTI94LzI8\nIf…",

          "description": "AT&T customers can stream it right to their phone or computer\nAs cloud gaming continues to build out, one service provider is now bundling streaming games in for its customers. AT&T announced today that Control Ultimate Edition is free to stream in its entirety to a phone, tablet, or computer for AT&T customers.\nAccording to AT&T's site, you just need a postpaid mobility plan. Then you can head to its Play Now site using a mobile device or computer. Enter your phone number and zip code for your account, and bam, Control Ultimate Edition.\nIt's available for a limited time, and powered by Google's Immersive Stream for Games. That program is a spin-off of Stadia, where companies can license Google's Stadia streaming tech for their own streaming purposes.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UISRDU_mzaw\nThis isn't the only game available, either. Batman: Arkham Knight is also on the program, as it launched last fall.\nCloudy future\nCloud gaming has been an interesting technology to watch develop over the years. Stadia itself went through some woes, shuttering its internal studios and looking to expand in other ways.\nA report in February indicated Google might be pivoting and adapting the technology, bringing the tech to services looking for streaming options. It certainly seems like this Control offer falls under that.\nOther companies have tried out their cloud tech, too. Microsoft's Xbox Cloud Gaming has made Xbox One and Series X|S games open for streaming through the cloud.\nFor AT&T, it's a very specific subset of users able to take advantage of this. But it is interesting, as a microcosm of where these options could go: mobile. Cloud options already feel largely targeted towards phones, as they make for capable and widely available streaming platforms. With a pack-in like Control Ultimate Edition, it's certainly a step to watch for future streaming developments.\nThe post Control Ultimate Edition is available for AT&T users to stream appeared first on Destructoid.",

We'll see more of both of them shortly, as Games Workshop is putting together a Warhammer Skulls showcase on June 1.\nWarhammer 40,000: Darktide and Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 are the showpiece games here — especially since they're new and they look cool — but the event will also cover the \"latest updates and future plans\" for some already released games, too. In its announcement, Games Workshop specifically pointed to Total War: Warhammer III, Warhammer 40,000: Battlesector, and Warhammer: Vermintide 2. We'll see what we get.\n[caption id=\"attachment_323256\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1920\"] That's a lot of logos![/caption]\nWhen to show up\nThe Warhammer Skulls event will begin at 10:00 a.m. Pacific on Wednesday, June 1, with \"week-long offers\" and new game content to follow. You can catch it live on Twitch.\nEven if you're only interested in seeing a new trailer or two, you may want to swing by for the wider showcase — Clive Standen (of Vikings fame) will be involved. (If you missed it, he's Captain Titus in Space Marine 2.) Considering how quickly our summer calendar is filling up, though, I don't fault anyone for being a bit more choosy with their time.\nDarktide isn't too far off with a September 13, 2022 release date, but Space Marine 2 feels much less tangible at this point — Saber Interactive is still listing a TBA launch.\nI'm ready to cull the hordes in both of these games.

Now, according to Animation Magazine, it'll be debuting soon, in the hopes to be sold to a distributor.\nCyber Group will be attending the Licensing Expo in Las Vegas from May 24-26, in a bid to sell the show. It's here that we'll likely see the first screens or maybe even a trailer, as well as info on some of the characters (and potential newcomers). In 2021, the company noted that \"for those who [don’t] know Final Fantasy IX, this will be an [introduction]...and for the many who [do], this will immerse them in a universe they’ll love.\"\nAt the moment, details are slim. The McFire Family, Gigantosaurus, and PressStart projects were all shown off: but we're waiting to see Final Fantasy IX at a later date. If you want to stew over what it could look like and the subject matter it could entail, you can peruse Cyber Group's catalog here.\nTo be clear, I don't think you should expect the moon here — or an epic series with adult themes. We already know it's aimed at kids, but their entire catalog is predicated on family viewing. As someone who does watch cartoons with their kid, I just hope it's nearly as good as Spidey and His Amazing Friends.\nThe post The Final Fantasy IX animated series is finally being shown at a tradeshow appeared first on Destructoid.",

Most famously, Nintendo fixed the fog in Ocarina of Time, which was one of the most egregious emulation releases in some time, and one of myriad errors.\nOver on Twitter, Switch \"tinkerer\" and Dolphin contributor OatmealDome figured out a basic patch notes rundown for the update, titled \"version 2.3.0:\"\nKirby 64 added\nStar Fox 64 had gamma adjustment enabled — gamma value was set to 1.8.\nDr. Mario 64 had renderer settings adjusted (“ConstValue_0” added)\nMario Golf had renderer settings adjusted (“ConstValue_1” added).\nIn short, you can see the results of the render fixing in the N64 on Switch patch here, and the gamma adjustment for Star Fox 64 is more obviously apparent. OatmealDome also notes that Kirby 64 is actually the least-touched N64 game to date, stating, \"Kirby 64 appears to have the least amount of patches and hacks that I’ve seen so far for this emulator. There are the usual renderer settings adjustments present, but there are no CPU instruction patches or hooks.\"\nWith that in mind, Kirby 64 also has a soft lock bug that will need to be addressed in the future. It occurs in underwater stages in specific conditions, but it's something for Nintendo to note nonetheless.\nThe post Nintendo continues to patch and fix N64 on Switch games appeared first on Destructoid.",

This towel is inspired by Spocco Square from the Nintendo Switch Sports game. Handy for keeping your head in the game, wicking away sweat, or cooling off during your next match or workout!\"\n\nThe lead time from an announcement to a release for a My Nintendo reward varies, but generally it can be anywhere from one to three weeks until it's up for sale. Expect it to arrive in mid-May at the latest, most likely. Based on prior reward structures, it'll probably be around 500 Platinum or more: but the Japanese Switch Sports towel reward (which is a different design) is 400.\nAs a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked.\nThere's free shipping on orders of $50 or more, and you can bundle cash products with the Platinum rewards if you want.

Their art combines the old with the new in a novel way.\nWhat are the odds?\nJust the other day I was thinking about another similar fan project — a custom Gengar plush with Sugimori-esque painterly detailing. There's a growing passion for this stuff among creators, and a riled-up audience of fans all ready to go, cash in hand.\nWith the power of nostalgia and the way trends seem to circle back around, I feel like it's only a matter of time before a real Pokemon game taps into this watercolor vibe.\nWhat is it with me getting my hopes up as a once-die-hard Pokemon fan?

The retro enthusiasts over at Hamster have taken time out from the Namco party to offer up one of the most infamous oddities of the classic arcade era. Straight out of Data East and into your hearts, it's Trio the Punch: Never Forget Me, now available on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.\nReleased in arcades in the spring of 1990, Trio the Punch: Never Forget Me is a delectably daft crossover beat-'em-up that stars characters from Data East's catalog, as well as some familiar, non-sequitur stages and even some iconic works of art. Players guide one of three heroes through incredibly strange side-scrolling action — fighting cities full of ninjas, monsters in the rainforest, giant robo-guardians, stacks of animals, and even the fire-breathing Data East veteran, Karnov. This is not to make mention of the moped-riding zombies, disembodied unicorn heads, or the player's enviable final form of... a sheep.\nCheck out the wacky antics in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber World of Longplays.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIPtzZHJnkg\nWhile Trio the Punch is hardly the most playable or enjoyable of classic side-scrolling actioners, the title has long cemented its place in video gaming history simply due to its nigh-on incomprehensible nature. The game does not offer any insight whatsoever in regards to plot or reason, and most on-screen text is just poorly translated (or simply garbled) gibberish. It's just a whole lot of nonsense, charmingly released as the arcade market truly started to find its feet with polished, well-produced, sensical video games. Among its contemporaries, Trio the Punch was batshit anarchy, and for that, it will remain curio in the video game hall of fame.\nTrio the Punch: Never Forget Me is available to download now on PS4 and Switch, priced at $8.\nThe post The legendarily odd Trio the Punch: Never Forget Me joins the Arcade Archives appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Yet another cozy game to look forward to\nThe games industry is flooding with cozy, impossibly cute life simulators right now, and as a massive fan of the genre, I personally could not be happier. Titles like Stardew Valley and Animal Crossing have left an obvious mark on the market, proving time and time again that gamers are craving a simpler, sweeter life. Next up in the long list of simulators is Little Witch in the Woods, and it's looking like a real contender to stand out among the competition and be one of my favorite games of recent memory.\nLittle Witch in the Woods may have just entered early access, but it's already been garnering a lot of attention on Steam and Xbox (it's also playable with Game Pass).\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lS9QHk2A6yg\nPlayers take on the role of Ellie, a young witch who takes it upon herself to collect items in the forest and help out her neighbors. Ellie also teams up with a sentient witch hat named Virgil, and works to hone her craft as an apprentice witch, an element reminiscent of Kiki's Delivery Service (which is unsurprisingly one of my favorite movies, go figure).\nEarly reviews say it's very similar to Stardew by way of gameplay, just with a witchy theme about it, and there's not much else you could say that would make me want to play this game more.\nThe developer of Little Witch in the Woods, Sunny Side Up, is reportedly very pleased with the response to the game so far, and are continued to update players. They say that the plan is for the game to get a full launch in 2023, and to add two more story chapters and an ending in addition to the prologue and first chapter that are currently available to play.\nIt sounds like they have a lot more game to make, but knowing that fans are already falling in love with the project so far has to be an amazing motivator. Godspeed, Sunny Side Up — we can't wait to see what else you have in store for us.\nThe post Adorably arcane life sim Little Witch in the Woods is in early access appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Regal Replica\nOne of the contributing factors to the enduring appeal of Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild lies in its introduction of many mythical new characters to the Zelda universe. And for those of you besotted with the underwater kingdom of Zora, First 4 Figures might have a treat in store for you.\nThe merch-maker has offered a first look at a brand new figurine capturing the beautiful form of Zoran princess and Champion of Hyrule, Mipha. The PVC figurine stands roughly nine inches in height and is delicately poised with her formidable Lightscale Trident. Mipha's ethereal presence and compelling beauty belie her adept combat skills and overwhelmingly courageous nature, reflected in her subtle stance.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGeIxpNMoMo&t\nMipha stands atop a sturdy circular base, emblazoned with the symbol of the secretive \"Shadow People,\" The Sheikah. The base features LED lighting effects, which light up her royal highness with a delectable aqua blue glow. The Mipha figurine will look mighty fine standing on anyone's bookshelf, and will make an even better accompaniment to F4F's previous releases of Princess Zelda, Revali, and, of course, Link himself.\nThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Mipha figurine is available to pre-order now from the official First 4 Figures website. Mipha will retail for around $150 USD on release, but those who pre-order now can bag an Early Bird price of $137.99, not including shipping or any potential customs charges. Mipha is expected to ship in the fourth quarter of 2022 and payment options are also available.\nThe post The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild’s Mipha is getting her own figurine appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It's an arrr-PG\nBandai Namco is showing a bit more of the battle side of its upcoming One Piece Odyssey. The role-playing game based on hit manga One Piece is launching sometime this year, and it certainly has some RPG systems in place.\nWhen the new One Piece game was first revealed, it definitely had some RPG vibes. Some new screenshots from the Japanese One Piece Odyssey site (as spotted by RPG Site) really emphasize just how it's tackling battles, though.\n\nThere's HP and TP, as well as a weapon triangle of sorts. There are definitely some Persona vibes to the UI elements here, and I think they actually work pretty well.\n\nAnother screenshot, shown above, also highlights some positioning mechanics. It looks like range and position on the field will be important too.\nOther screenshots show different members of the Straw Hat Pirates using their various abilities to navigate the environment. From slicing a gate in half to seemingly flying across the map, it looks like overworld traversal mechanics will play a role too.\n\nStraw hat life\nI am, admittedly, not a huge follower of One Piece. I've dug other Shonen Jump series like Jujutsu Kaisen and My Hero Academia, but never taken the dive on One Piece, due in large part to just how lengthy it is. My backlog is already gigantic.\nThat said, these screenshots are making a pretty good case for checking out One Piece Odyssey. While anime spinoffs usually veer into fighting games or other action-oriented formats, RPGs are relatively unexplored territory. Bandai Namco seems to really be going for a full-on RPG with One Piece Odyssey though, with screenshots more evocative of Persona and the Atelier series.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yogS2oJ2pZI\nNo firm date's been set yet, but One Piece Odyssey is due out sometime this year for PC, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, and PS5.\nThe post New One Piece Odyssey screenshots show off its RPG battles appeared first on Destructoid.",

We were talking about Good Smile Company's figure for Aloy (of Horizon Zero Dawn and Forbidden West fame) just a few days ago. And now here's the humble little bot, looking like a champ. When's the next game? There's got to be another one.\nhttps://twitter.com/GoodSmile_US/status/1527487300283801610\nGood Smile Company is taking pre-orders, and you'll have until June 29 to partake. The Astro Nendoroid costs $63.99, and it's aiming to ship in February 2023, but as Siliconera points out, these things have a tendency to slip. You'll need some patience either way.\nAside from the default face, Astro also comes with swappable \"dizzy\" and \"smiling\" expressions, as well as accessories: a fuse, a PlayStation coin, and laser feet.\nI love this design as is, and it's a natural fit for the Nendoroid line, but one thing is missing. Imagine if they recreated some of the collectible PlayStation console \"artifacts\" from Astro's Playroom. The pack-in PS5 game was such a nostalgic, nod-filled collect-a-thon.\nThe Astro Bot figure is so cute and pure, I feel guilty for neglecting Astro's Playroom — a game I got all of the trophies for but admittedly haven't thought about much since the PS5 launched. I should download that again (you can never have enough free space...) and try to improve some of my times.

Bandai Namco is preparing for the release of the remastered Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series on PC and consoles, and has dropped a short, nostalgia-sparking clip from the retro adventures.\nAs previously reported, Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series is a compendium containing remasters of the 2008 Wii release Klonoa: Door to Phantomile (itself a remake of the 1997 PlayStation original) and the 2001 PS2 sequel Klonoa: Lunatea’s Veil. Developed by Monkeycraft, the two games have been lovingly restored with sharp HD visuals, 60 FPS gameplay, and boosted with new features, including rebalanced difficulty options and an all-new two-player co-op mode.\n2022 sees Klonoa celebrate their 25thn birthday, so now is the perfect time to release this delightful looking retrospective of their most memorable adventures. Sadly, the compendium will not contain all of the Klonoa titles — so you won't find their Game Boy Advance or Wonderswan adventures herein — but it will at least be fun to visit the charming world of Lunatea, looking fresher and more colorful than ever before.\nKlonoa is one of a number of somewhat forgotten gaming heroes making a grand comeback, so it's a pretty rad time to be a fan of classic platforming adventures. Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series launches July 8 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.\nhttps://twitter.com/BandaiNamcoEU/status/1526956304140587009?s=20&t=5d04ZoEat3YvwIRds0YKWQ\nThe post Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series hits July, and here’s a small snippet appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Edelgard and co. get some new duds\nThe next faction spotlight for Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes is here, and it's all about Edelgard and the Black Eagles.\nThe Adrestian Empire is the banner they'll be fighting under, but Three Houses players will remember this motley crew as the Black Eagles. Edelgard is here, of course, but in today's trailer we get to see all the former students in action.\nThere are some neat touches here, considering the variety of skillsets in the Black Eagles. Two little aspects I dug were Dorothea using singing as a weapon, and Petra's big attack utilizing a bow (since she is an Assassin class when you fight her in other houses' campaigns).\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EGQ3oKDcj0\nTwo houses down, one to go\nThat's two of Fire Emblem: Three Houses' big factions down, one left to go. It looks like since we have Black Eagles and Blue Lions covered, the Golden Deer will be the last crew to get a spotlight.\nThat said, it's impressive to see how every student in each house is a full-on playable character in Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes. With just the three houses and protagonist Shez, that's 25 characters.\nI'm curious to see if we get any of the school staff or the endearing basement goths from the Ashen Wolves campaign. And I'd be really surprised if Anna, the series' long-running \"mascot\" merchant, doesn't also make an appearance.\nI'm hopeful (ha) that Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes will turn out as a pretty good musou game, as the Nintendo crossovers have run the gamut. The Hyrule Warriors side has been generally solid to pretty darn good. But Fire Emblem Warriors missed some of that spark.\nWith a laser focus on just Fódlan and the world of Fire Emblem: Three Houses, maybe Three Hopes can make the Warriors side click. Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes hits Nintendo Switch on June 24.\nThe post Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes trailer shows off the Black Eagles’ new looks appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "I was just telling a friend that I would love to see a Lobo television show that draws inspiration from The Mandalorian and Deadpool. Picture an intergalactic bounty hunter with an attitude problem – that's basically Lobo. He first appeared in an Omega Men comic book in 1983, and after bouncing through dozens of DC comic book series for decades, finally made his live-action debut in an episode of Krypton. The point being: We need more Lobo.\nHe's a wild character who almost starred in his own video game in 1996. Ocean of America was hard at work on a fighting game starring Lobo for Super Nintendo and Genesis. As the fact sheets below show, the developer apparently had most of the gameplay details worked out. The canceled project included moves like \"Ram Grenade Down Throat,\" \"Blow Opponent in Half,\" and \"Fire Hole Through Opponent.\" The setup is what you would expect: Lobo must kill everyone who stands in his way. He even has to murder a clone of himself. Below are a number of fact sheets from Game Informer's archives that outline the project, and a gameplay video from a prototype.\nI doubt we'll ever see Lobo in a game, but there's a chance more DC characters like Wonder Woman will get their own projects. Which DC hero do you think deserves a shot at a game next? Let us know in the comments section below.",

The mashup you’ve pictured in your head a hundred times – Street Fighter vs. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles – is becoming an action figure reality. That’s because Playmates Toys is releasing four SF vs TMNT character sets and two are coming later this year. \nThe four sets respectively are:\nRyu vs. Leonardo – the leaders face off\nChun-Li vs. Michelangelo – authority vs. exuberance\nGuile vs Raphael – strength vs. strength\nKen Masters vs. Donatello – restraint vs. intellect\n\nThe two releasing this fall are Ryu vs. Leonardo and Chun-Li vs Michelangelo, and it is then that they’ll hit retail shelves. Unfortunately, as you can see above, those are the only two sets with images so far. As for where, Playmates Toys doesn’t say in today’s news, but it’s likely they’ll end up where Playmates Toys figures are typically sold near you. \n“Each figure in the collection stands six inches tall and is highly poseable with multiple points of articulation – from ball joints at the head, shoulders and hips, to split joint elbows and knees, and at the wrist, ankles, upper arms, and thighs,” a press release reads. “Authentically detailed and decorated as seen in the Street Fighter II video game, Street Fighter vs. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is packed out in an ‘80s video game console-shaped window box packaging.” \nThis collection, which encompasses four SF vs. TMNT faceoffs, was created in celebration of Street Fighter’s 35th Anniversary, which is this year. \nWhat SF vs. TMNT matchups would you like to see?

In a new partnership with Warner Bros., Looney Tunes are coming to the high-octane toy racer in July.\nA brief teaser trailer shows off the ACME warehouse, and as the camera pans down, we hear the telltale sounds of the Roadrunner and Wile E. Coyote before they're seen giving chase in car form on a Hot Wheels track. The Looney Tunes Expansion contains five new Tune-flavored cars, a themed track builder module, themed profile and basement customization items, along with the Looney Tunes Adventure Park environment to cruise around. The Adventure Park features four environments with different themes, one of which being a desert area to recreate Roadrunner and Wile E. chases of your own.\nHot Wheels released a set of six physical Looney Tunes cars in 2017, with the two vehicles shown in the trailer among the group. The others not announced from that set include Bugs Bunny, Taz the Tazmanian Devil, Marvin the Martian, and Daffy Duck. If I were a betting man, I'd assume the other three cars will come from these remaining four collectibles as well.\nThe Looney Tunes Expansion will be available on July 14 and can be purchased as a piecemeal DLC for Hot Wheels Unleashed but is also tied to the upcoming Hot Wheels Pass vol. 3 (available for purchase on June 9), which includes more vehicles, customizations, and Track Builder Modules.

          "description": "2D Action RPG Lost Epic is graduating from Steam Early Access and going 1.0 this July. The launch also brings the game to PlayStation platforms, marking the game’s first appearance on consoles. \nLost Epic first launched in Early Access in June 2021, and it blends Metroidvania-style exploration, Souls-inspired fast-paced combat, and a vibrant anime presentation. Players control a God Slayer on a quest to defeat a pantheon of divine gods threatening humanity. The hack ‘n slash combat encourages thoughtful combo-building and utilization of a parry mechanic to slay Lost Epic’s challenging enemies. God Slayers are fully customizable thanks to a deep skill tree, and you can craft enchantments and other items to bolster your arsenal. You can even tackle the campaign alongside friends in three-player online co-op. Check out the release date trailer below to see Lost Epic in action. \n\n\nBefore launch, Steam Early Access players can now enjoy a new update, Ver 1.3.0, that adds a new world: the Abyss. This patch adds new bosses and the Eyes of God item used to uncover additional unseen paths leading to the game’s final world. You can watch the video for that below. \n\n\nAt launch, Lost Epic receives a new world called the Sky Spire. The new area contains a powerful raid boss to tackle alone or alongside allies. Players can wield new weapons such as the Regalia blade, staff, shield, and new weapon enhancement materials. Lastly, characters from developer Team Earth Wars’ previous title, Earth’s Dawn, will become playable.  \nYou can play the final version of Lost Epic on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC on July 28. The developer also plans to raise the game's price at launch. The new price isn’t listed, but Lost Epic is $19.99 on Steam (though it’s currently discounted to $14.99 until May 27). That means you’ll want to grab it on PC now if you think the game is up your alley.",

Then, Sony revealed some of its PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, and classic games lineup, including a selection of PS1 games, that would be coming to the service. That list wasn’t exhaustive, though, and now, two more classic games have seemingly leaked, as reported by Eurogamer. \nFunnily enough, it appears to have been PlayStation itself that accidentally leaked the two new classic games – Oddworld: Abe’s Odyssey (PS1) and Ridge Racer 2 (PSP) – because fans found both listed on the Malaysian PSN store. At the time of this writing, the Abe’s Odyssey page is still up but the Ridge Racer 2 page takes you to a window that says “Not available for purchase” and nothing else. You can also view the Malaysian PSN’s listing of two previously announced PS1 games coming to PS Plus next month – Worms Armageddon and Worms World Party. \nAs Eurogamer notes, in the ResetEra post where these (seemingly) accidental leaks were first found by players, you can view multiple screenshots from the Ridge Racer 2 listing. \nOver on Video Games Chronicle, you can view nearly 10 minutes of Abe’s Odyssey in action, including a look at its emulation and how the rewind feature works.  \nWhile PlayStation has yet to officially confirm whether Abe’s Odyssey and Ridge Racer 2 are coming to PS Plus, it seems all but guaranteed. The Malaysian PSN page for Abe's Odyssey even shows “PS1 Emulation” in the title. While waiting to see if these two games hit the revamped PS Plus service here in the West, read Game Informer’s breakdown of all the games announced for PS Plus so far and then read about the three different PS Plus tiers to determine which one is the best for you.\n[Source: Eurogamer]\nAre you excited about these two games?

This week, we conclude our season by analyzing 2020's Hades. \nUnlike Supergiant Games' previous titles, Hades had two release dates. Its first release came on December 6, 2018 when it launched in early access on PC, while the full game was available to be played on September 17, 2020. Hades takes everything the studio has learned up to this point and blends them into an ambitious rogue-lite that's developed in a way the team has never experienced before: with the gaming public playing the game as it's being made. Check out this episode to learn the backstory of how Pyre's large cast of characters inspired the evolving narrative of Zagreus and his dysfunctional diety family, how the studio fared developing an early access game, and learn all about Greek mythology from our guest, the incomparable Jill Grodt.\nJoin hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), John Carson (@John_Carson), along with Game Informer associate editor Jill Grodt (@Finruin) for a verbal stroll through the history and narrative of Hades!\nIf you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com.

In it, Chip and Dale deal with the realities of staying relevant in an industry that has changed significantly over the course of multiple decades. In one scene at a fan convention, the Rangers run into a familiar face that we never thought we'd actually see in a finished film, Ugly Sonic.\nThat's right, the version of Sonic the Hedgehog that caused the 2020 film to be delayed and re-modeled makes his triumphant return in Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers.

Join us for another special episode of The GI Show, where we're reviewing both episode nine of Halo and season one as a whole.\n\n\nThe regular team is back to wrap up the season, but we couldn't do a Halo review without a familiar friend. Alex Stadnik, Brian Shea, and Andrew Reiner are joined by Kate Sánchez, founder of But Why Tho? to break down the highs and lows of this episode and the season in this spoiler-filled discussion.\nIn episode nine, we find John and company reeling from the fallout of Makee's decision, setting the stage for the final battle. The good news is that \"Transcendence\" has plenty of satisfying action that genuinely feels like what we love about Halo as a video game. The bad news is those questionable story choices continue to bring down our enjoyment of the series.\nWhen looking at the first season as a whole, it's clear that plenty of things could have been better. In that spirit, we finish out this episode of The GI Show and our Halo review with our thoughts on the state of Master Chief, Halsey, and Co.'s tale and whether or not we're excited about a second season. We also grade the show on the GI review scale for those dying to know what we thought numerically.\nThank you so much for joining us on this journey. While the show had its ups and downs, it was so fun to get to chat with the community on a weekly basis. We hope you enjoyed these videos, and we're so excited to continue our review series in the not too distant future. \nWhat do you think about Halo? Be sure to let us know in the comments below. We'd also love your feedback on the extra GI Show episodes. Do you like them? Do you want to see us focus on games or the Marvel shows in the future?

And now, today, you get to watch more than 20 minutes of our gameplay!\n\n\nAs you'll soon hear, not only did your hosts, Game Informer editors Wesley LeBlanc and Alex Stadnik, get the chance to go hands-on with Fueled Up, they were joined by two of the devs from Fireline Games – Kacper Kowalczuk and Chris Heldt – to round out the four-person team. If you're wondering how we did so well playing Fueled Up, just know it's because Wesley and Alex are really good at video games and totally not because they had two people who actually created this game helping them. \nVIDEO\nEnjoy this first look at Fueled Up gameplay on PC as Wesley and Alex ask them questions about the game, how the four-person development studio developed it, what they're hoping to add to the cooperative multiplayer space, and more. Be on the lookout for Fueled Up when it hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC sometime this year. \nFor more about Fueled Up, be sure to watch the reveal trailer from last month.

          "description": "A not-so-long time ago in the same galaxy we all reside in, Respawn Entertainment deviated from its first-person shooter roots to create Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66. After he’s outed by the Sith, he embarks on a quest to recover an artifact capable of locating force-sensitive children while also avoiding capture by the Inquisitors, who are elite Jedi hunters. \nThe game features a blend of lightsaber combat and a suite of Force abilities. Borrowing inspiration from FromSoftware’s Soul series, encounters are challenging, requiring a strategic blend of blocks and parries to outduel opponents. Meanwhile, the various planets take on a Metroid-inspired progression with players unlocking abilities to backtrack to previously inaccessible areas. \nWatch on Twitch!\nFallen Order was released on November 15, 2019, and was a critical and financial success. It also served as a saving grace for single-player fans, providing proof to an increasingly multiplayer-focused EA that linear story-driven experiences can still make the big bucks. With a sequel reportedly in the works, we’re revisiting this gem of the Star Wars video game pantheon. \nJoin Marcus Stewart, Andrew Reiner, and John Carson on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central as we journey through the entirety of Cal Kestis’ adventure. Expect plenty of laughs, deaths, and general nerding out over all things Star Wars. We encourage you to hang out with us in chat.

Since its release, and subsequent Director’s Cut rerelease, fans have wondered what was next for Hideo Kojima, the director of Death Stranding and the Metal Gear Solid series. \nIt seems that what’s next might be a sequel to Death Stranding. That’s because in a new interview with Leo, Death Stranding actor Norman Reedus, who plays Sam Bridges in the game, seems to have confirmed a second one is now in production, as spotted first by GamerUP on Twitter. When asked about Death Stranding, Reedus said “we just started the second one” before diving deeper into how he got involved with the first Death Stranding. \nDeath Stranding 2, or a sequel to Death Stranding, has not been officially revealed or even hinted at by PlayStation or Kojima. Of course, Kojima could be working on other games right now too – in fact, he recently hinted that he might be working on two upcoming games – and those might even release before this Death Stranding sequel if what Reedus said is true. Only time will tell for now but it’s great to be a Death Stranding fan, it seems. \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer’s Death Stranding review and then read our impressions of Death Stranding Director’s Cut. Read about how Kojima might be working on two upcoming games after that. \n[Source: Leo via GamerUP]\nDo you want a sequel to Death Stranding? Let us know in the comments below!",

The lights begin turning off on Monday, May 23, when players lose the ability to add eShop funds using credit cards.\nIf you’ve recently turned on your 3DS or Wii U, you likely received a notification reminding you that your stored credit cards will soon become useless. You’ll still be able to add money using Nintendo eShop gift cards – that option won’t disappear until August 29. But if you want to take advantage of the convenience of using your own payment methods without taking a trip to the store, this weekend is your last chance to unleash a final spending spree. Nintendo has not specified the exact time on Monday that credit cards will be disabled.  \nKeep in mind that even once credit and gift card options go away, players can link their Nintendo Network ID wallet (used for the 3DS/Wii U stores) with their Nintendo Account wallet (used to buy Switch games). The combined balance of both wallets can be used buy software on all three platforms. Once August passes, this will be the only method of buying 3DS/Wii U games until the March deadline. Afterward, whatever funds remain can only be spent on Switch purchases. \nAs a final reminder, you will still be able to play 3DS/Wii U games online and redownload purchased games, DLC, and updates after March 2023. Nintendo states this will remain the case for “the foreseeable future.”\nFor more information, visit Nintendo’s Q&A support page for the shutdown process.",

For starters, the upcoming Disney Plus show, Obi-Wan Kenobi, begins next week and Disney and Fortnite have an extensive history of collaborating ahead of big releases like movies or TV shows. There’s also the fact that Obi-Wan’s lightsaber is already in Fortnite as it was one of four added to the game during its May the Fourth Star Wars Celebration period. \nNow, it’s official: the Jedi master is coming to Fortnite to find the high ground. More specifically, he’ll hit the Fortnite Item Shop on Thursday, May 26, at 8 p.m. ET. That’s just in time for his big Disney Plus show, which begins the next day.

          "description": "TT Games’ Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga hit consoles and PC last month and since its release, it’s received two new character packs. Today, however, it received its first patch and after downloading it, you’ll find that there are 34 new Kyber Bricks to discover. \nWhile this is the first update for The Skywalker Saga, it is surprisingly a smaller one, bringing just a few fixes and a handful of Capital Ship encounters with it, as reported by Nintendo Everything.\n\n\nHere’s a look at the full patch notes for this May 2022 update: \nNumerous fixes to stability, quality, progression and performance issues throughout the title, including fixes for:\nIssue in Episode 7 where in certain situations Maz would not be present on Takodana to continue Story mission ‘Friends of the Resistance’.\nIssue in Episode 3 where in certain situations the level trigger for ‘The High Ground’ could fail to appear.\nIssue in ‘Green Harvest’ freeplay mission where under certain criteria the camera would be stuck on Tatooine indefinitely.\nImplemented 4 new Capital Ship encounters in Local Space adding 34 additional Kyber Bricks to collect:\nFulminatrix\nHome One\nInvisible Hand\nVenator\nAs you can see, the patch fixes three issues that, if encountered, could stop your progression forward in the game. It also adds four new Capital Ship encounters to The Skywalker Saga, which includes with it 34 additional Kyber Bricks to collect. \nWhile waiting for this patch to download, read Game Informer’s Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga review, and then check out our guide of codes to unlock additional characters in Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga.

According to Bend Studio, PlayStation's trophies are coming to select classic games included with the new PlayStation Plus subscription tiers.\nIncoming From Bend Studio:\npic.twitter.com/YVdMixZxBR\nMay 19, 2022\nBend Studio announced in a tweet today that Syphon Filter is going to come packed with trophies to obtain when it releases as part of the upcoming PlayStation Plus expansion. The tweet reads, \"Incoming From Bend Studio: Agency intel reports that Syphon Filter will include trophies when it arrives on the all-new PlayStation Plus.\" The message was delivered with an attached video of a silver trophy notification for a milestone called \"An Explosive Start.\" A follow-up tweet reveals the existence of a platinum trophy for the game as well. That trophy has the name \"Excellent work, Agent.\"\nWith the reveal of Syphon Filter joining the ranks of platinum-able games, more studios will hopefully follow suit and reveal whether their games will use the achievement system. Sony unveiled a selection of games coming to PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium subscription tiers, including original PlayStation games like Ape Escape, Hot Shots Golf, I.Q. Intelligent Cube, and Jumping Flash, though Syphon Filter is the only one on the list confirmed for trophy support.\nPlayStation Plus' revamp adds two more pricing tiers with value-adds such as a downloadable game library and cloud streaming on compatible devices and PCs. You can read about the pricing and tier differences here. The new subscription tiers go live on June 13 in North America.\nWhich classic PlayStation games would you like to see with trophy support?

          "description": "Yesterday, Marvel teased that it would be announcing a new video game today, and it has done just that with Marvel Snap, a new free-to-play collectible card game for PC and mobile devices developed by Nuverse and Second Dinner. \nMarvel calls it a “revolutionary game experience that unleashes the entire Marvel multiverse into a fast-paced, adrenaline-pumping card battle” that tasks players with assembling their ultimate Marvel dream team complete with both heroes and villains. To do so, players will need to collect “endless” card variants and use them in collectible card game plays. Each card game match lasts about three minutes. It is set to launch later this year. \n\n\n“Featuring 150+ iconic Marvel characters, Marvel Snap brings together stunning art from Marvel’s rich 80-year history with beautiful, brand new original illustrations to deliver hundreds of collectible art pieces in an intense player vs. player (PVP) fast-paced CCG,” a press release reads. “Marvel Snap introduces a new way to compete for the highest ranks, allowing players to ‘Snap’ to raise the stakes and double down. The mind games and bluffing inherent in this innovative mechanic create a game that is truly impossible to master.” \n\nAt launch, Marvel Snap will feature more than 150 “unique cards,” and each will have multiple variations. According to the press release, each match will feature three of more than 50 random Marvel locations with game-changing effects. \n\nBeginning today, you can sign up for a limited edition closed beta on Android devices here. When the game launches later this year, it will be available in 13 different languages on PC and mobile devices. \nIn regards to the development teams, Nuverse is perhaps best known for its work on mobile titles such as Sonic at the Olympic Games – Tokyo 2020, One Piece: Blood Routes, and Warhammer 40,000: Lost Crusade. Second Dinner is comprised of developers that have worked on Hearthstone, World of Warcraft, Halo, and more. \nAre you excited for Marvel Snap? Let us know in the comments below!",

          "description": "Few genres provide the simple pleasure of a good old-fashioned beat ‘em up. After all, these arcade-style games let you and your buddies punch and kick dozens of often colorful enemies in the face. What’s not to love? Double-teaming mobs of enemies or a sturdy boss strengthens bonds. Conversely, repeatedly grabbing health pick-ups “on accident” with a full health bar while your friend hangs on by a thread can reveal cracks in a relationship. Whatever side of the fence you’re on, we’ve all likely played these sorts of games, and the last decade has seen modernized takes on the winning formula. Here are 10 of the best contemporary beat ‘em ups (in no particular order) that you can play right now.

          "description": "Developer Spiders has announced GreedFall 2: The Dying World, a sequel to its 2019 role-playing game GreedFall.\nThe game takes place three years after the events of GreedFall. Players control a native of Teer Fradee, the first game’s island setting, who is captured and taken to the continent of Gacane. This nation is the home of the invading colonists, and it has fallen due to a combination of a deadly plague and political infighting between various factions. It’s up to you to prevent this unfamiliar land and your home from succumbing to disaster.\n\n\nLike the first game, players can solve problems using diplomacy or aggression. Spiders also promises GreedFall 2 boasts new mechanics and more tactical combat but doesn’t elaborate on either bullet point. \nThe studio currently has its hands full creating Steelrising, its French Revolution action RPG slated for September. Thus, GreedFall 2: The Dying World won’t arrive until 2024 for PC and unspecified consoles. \nThe first GreedFall had cool ideas, but it ultimately left us wanting more. We’re curious to see how the sequel builds upon its solid foundation. You can read our GreedFall review here.",

His vision: give younger developers a chance to direct their own games and provide opportunities they might not get at other companies. Or, more bluntly, as he told Polygon in 2014, let people under 40 direct games.\n“If you’re over 40, you’re somewhat out of touch with the people buying your games,” Mikami told the outlet, “and when you’re young, you don’t know enough about the industry.

          "description": "Marvel has revealed that it is announcing a new game tomorrow, May 18. \nThis news comes by way of a new tweet from the official Marvel Entertainment Twitter account, which teases the game in a quick 22-second video. As for when, Marvel says “Tune in tomorrow at 10 AM PST,” which means we’re already less than 24 hours away from finding out exactly what it is. You can check out the teaser below: \nNew Game Announcement!\npic.twitter.com/TIHbrUqmOK\nMay 18, 2022\nAs you can see, we get a glimpse at America Chavez, who you might have just recently seen in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, Ironheart, who is getting her own Disney Plus series, and Venom. There also appears to be some Doombots or some kind of enemy minion related to Doctor Doom. However, the teaser ends with a splash screen with more than 100 Marvel character logos ranging from deeper cut characters like Blink and Quake to more mainstream ones such as Thanos and Wolverine. \nElsewhere in the trailer, we see the Nuverse Logo and the Second Dinner logo, both game development studios. Nuverse is perhaps best known for its work on mobile titles such as Sonic at the Olympic Games – Tokyo 2020, One Piece: Blood Routes, and Warhammer 40,000: Lost Crusade. Second Dinner has worked on Hearthstone, World of Warcraft, Halo, and more. With this in mind, it might be possible that Marvel is teasing a mobile game considering both studios have a pedigree in that space. Of course, it could turn out to be a full console game too. Only time will tell for now but fortunately, you don’t have to wait too long. \nIn the meantime, check out our list of upcoming superhero games and then read about why one Game Informer editor believes it’s time for Doctor Strange to get his own game. Check out Game Informer’s Marvel’s Midnight Suns hub for more information about that game, which might be out sooner than you think. \nWhat kind of game do you hope this new Marvel game is?

Slated to release this December, this figure comes with three face plates, allowing you to harness a little more realism, depending on what weapon or pose you put Aloy in. She stands at approximately 3.94 inches in height.\nAlong with the amazing game, Aloy has had a big year, making an appearance in Fortnite as a purchasable skin, and will likely be featured in the PlayStation VR2 game, Horizon: Call of the Mountain, which we hope hits in the months ahead.\nIf you are collector of game merchandise, Nendoroid has long been turning popular game leads into cute figures. Overwatch's Junkrat and D.Va, Bayonetta, and Hades' Zagreus are just a few of them that you can grab. You can find more about Aloy at Good Smiles' official site.

          "description": "Test Drive Unlimited: Solar Crown has been bit by the delay bug. The game was scheduled to launch this September, but it’s been pushed to 2023. \nThe long-awaited revival of the dormant racing franchise needs more time in the shop to polish up its systems, according to an update by publisher Nacon (thanks, Eurogamer). The statement reads in part: \n“With so much support from fans of the series, we know many of you will be disappointed, but our goal with Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown is to make it the most polished gaming experience in the franchise by spending more time on its development.” \nTo soften the blow, the team announced plans to hold closed betas at some point in the future, giving players a chance to sit behind the wheel before launch. \nNacon has also decided to cancel the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of Solar Crown “with the aim of making the most of the technology in the latest consoles.\" You can now pick up the game on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. Solar Crown joins Gotham Knights as another cross-generation title to abandon its planned last-gen ports in favor of maximizing the current-gen experience. \nTest Drive Unlimited: Solar Crown was first unveiled in 2020 and is the first entry in the franchise since 2012's Test Drive: Ferrari Racing Legends (although the last Unlimited game was Unlimited 2 in 2011). The game tasks racing fans with aligning themselves with one of two clans, The Streets and The Sharps, to compete in races across an expansive Hong Kong Island. Outside of races, players can explore and expand the headquarters of their chosen faction. \n2022 has seen several high-profile titles get pushed into the following year. You can check out the complete list of those games here.",

The game’s 3v3 contests combine skating, racing, and a bit of rugby. Teams skate around a track carrying a ball to toss through a goal for points. You can also earn additional points based on the number of laps you complete. Maintaining possession of the ball requires players to rough each other up using tackle moves and other attacks. Roller Champions ups the ante on real-life roller derby by letting players skate up and along walls and perform other over-the-top moves. \n\n\nAs players rack up victories they’ll climb the ladder of a championship league to gain new stadiums, maps, and fans. Your Champion can be customized with unlockable items earned both in-game and through a season pass (dubbed a Roller Pass). A social hub fashioned as a skatepark allows friends and other players to meet up, practice, or indulge in mini-games. \nRoller Champions supports cross-play and cross-progression between PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC through the Ubisoft Store. The game is also playable on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S via backward compatibility. Ubisoft also plans to bring Roller Champions to Switch, Stadia, and Amazon Luna at a later date. \nRoller Champions was first announced during E3 2019 with a pre-alpha demo. You can watch us take that version of the game for a spin in this episode of New Gameplay Today.",
