Today, the developer published a video interview with the game's lead producer, Xavier Manzanares, which gives more details about some of the game's new features.\nThe interview covers the game's new playable characters, Bowser and Edge; the latter is seen in action with moves that prioritise close and mid-range combat, while Bowser's size makes him a more unusual addition. These characters were revealed in an earlier trailer, but this new gameplay footage means you can get a head start on planning your ultimate line-up.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos.\nThe project is said to be a 'massive remake and rewrite' of the original, with development commencing in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which forced Frogwares to cease development on its previous project. With circumstances surrounding the invasion still heavily affecting the studio, it has also decided to leverage Kickstarter to assist with the game's funding, allowing fans to support the studio in exchange for rewards and a price reduction.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Master crafters.\nThe music of Xenoblade Chronicles 3 has rightly gained lots of attention since the game was announced. With a team helmed by legendary JRPG composer Yasunori Mitsuda (of Chrono Trigger, Xenogears, and Chrono Cross fame), and made up of Xenoblade series veterans ACE, Kenji Hiramatsu, and Manami Kiyota, there's no doubt the music will be quality. And basically, every single trailer has confirmed that.\nOne of the most arresting tunes we've heard is the game's main theme — A Life Sent On. Lead by a beautiful Celtic-sounding flute, and evoking powerful emotions, this stunned us from the very first trailer it was used in. It's haunting, and despite sounding a little Celtic (a bit of a signature sound for Mitsuda), there's something very unique about it. And it turns out that it's all down to some custom-made flutes.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

This makes it a good time to pick up a SATA drive for desktops or laptops that can't accommodate another M.2 drive, especially for media or game storage where the speed difference between SATA and NVMe is minimal. \nToday, Teamgroup's imaginatively-named T-Force Vulcan Z drive is down to $128 for a 2TB model, the lowest price we can find for this size at present. \nNote that to get this price, you do need to be an Amazon Prime member - normal folk you like and me will see a price of $160 instead, alongside a reminder to 'join Prime to save $32 on this item'. You should be able to join Prime under a free trial, order the item and then cancel your Prime status to avoid a charge. \nRead more",

          "description": "I’ve been excited to play Exoprimal, Capcom’s upcoming multiplayer dino shooter, ever since it used the phrase “unstoppable raptor horde” in one of its trailers. It is a completely unhinged combination of words that makes me giddy just thinking about them. I’ll often find myself muttering them out loud when I’m unloading the dishwasher or folding laundry. “Unstoppable raptor horde”. It’s like the season finale of language. It’s perfect.\r\n\n\r\nAdmittedly, prior to the existence of that phrase, I was feeling a little sceptical about Exoprimal’s existence. Not only does Capcom have - let’s say - a less than favourable track record when it comes to multiplayer titles, but as a long-term fan of Dino Crisis I was a bit miffed to see them creating a game featuring prehistoric creatures that wasn’t some kind of lavish remake of my beloved PS1 series.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "The Sims 4 High School Years is launching today, but its release looks set to be overshadowed by a couple of major bugs introduced by its supporting update, Patch 132. The patch came out on Tuesday and, if you've played The Sims 4 since then, you'll have automatically downloaded it unless you've been playing offline. While the patch's release coincides with the High School Years expansion and supports a number of its features, it also added several new elements to the ever-evolving base game. These include long-time fan requests like sexual orientation customisation, body hair options, and the return of a wants and fears system in the style of The Sims 2.\nRead more",

I haven't done that with Hob's Barrow yet,\" he says. \"Basically, Victorian gothic horror story. That's the best way to describe it.\"\nOriginally announced as Incantamentum (Gilbert jokes that one of the reasons behind the name change is because he could never pronounce \"Incantamentum\" correctly), Wadjet Eye got involved after Gilbert played the Steam demo last year and emailed the developer. \"I said, 'Hey, I played the demo. I really liked it. Please tell me you're going to be adding voice acting to this because it's screaming for it',\" Gilbert tells me. \"And he said, 'Well, we will if we can find a publisher who'll do it for us.'\" So now Wadjet Eye are publishing, and Gilbert is overseeing the voice recording.\nRead more",

Instead, your city flourishes or not based on your ability to fulfil each building's resource requirements, which quickly turns progress into more of a puzzle than a management game.\r\n\nIt's out on Steam now, and you can find a trailer of its pretty voxel world below.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Whether you're up to no good in Red Dead Redemption 2 or stealing from the rich to (sort of) give to the poor in the original Desperados, these temples of cash have long been the scenes of messy shootouts, upturned tables, and big, golden pay-outs. At least when your heist strategy's going according to plan, that is. In an exclusive demo for one of the later levels in Hard West 2, the upcoming sequel to the 2015 turn-based tactics original, Ice Code Games' chief technology officer Mateusz Pilski is starting to feel the heat a bit. The bank is well guarded, with at least half a dozen gunslingers staking out the doors at the front, and untold numbers waiting in hidden nooks and crannies further back. He takes a moment to consider his approach, but he begins his assault with confidence.  \n\"In any XCOM-like, when you see that many enemies and that much firepower, in that good a position, you think, okay, I'm fucked up,\" he tells me. \"In just a second, I will show you how you can use Bravado to totally overturn the situation.\"\nRead more",

You can now pick up this super-fast gaming CPU for less than £130, while the more powerful 5600X costs £170 after a similar discount - some way below the last sale price we saw it at. To get the reduced price, you'll need to use code HOT10 at the checkout to knock 10% off the price. \nHigher-end Ryzen processors have also seen discounts in recent weeks. We spotted deals on the Ryzen 7 5800X and Ryzen 9 5900X using the same Ebay HOT10 code. \nRead more",

          "description": "Cycling in video games leans towards the extreme and the exciting: bombing downhill at murderous speeds, professional racing, treasure hunt, and such. I'd like to see more of the mundane too. For many adults, a bicycle is simply a way to get to work, to the shops, or to see your pals. So after battle royale shooter PUBG: Battlegrounds added bicycles, I decided to commute around the stag & hen weekend warzones by bike as much as possible.\nRead more",

The Final Earth 2 is an ant farm kind of game that places very few limits on what you can build where, and lets you cheaply restructure as needed even if you mess it up.\nThe idea is you build vertically, with each building taking up a block, and your people freely travelling through all of them to get to work or home or the pub. Everyone else who plays it seems to build enormous, elaborate, impressively well organised structures that are even kind of beautiful. I build a random pile of crap. I am absolutely rubbish at it.\nRead more",

          "description": "It’s kind of remarkable how little we really know about Nvidia’s next gaming graphics cards, the RTX 40 series. AMD are openly working on next-gen, RDNA 3-based Radeon GPUs, and Intel are gearing up for the full launch of their Arc Alchemist cards before the end of summer – yet there’s not been so much as a single presentation slide on Nvidia’s wares. Not the kind of hype-building you’d expect, given how many of the current generation’s best graphics cards have GeForce badges.\r\n\n\r\nArriving to fill that info void are, inevitably, leaks. If you don’t regularly hang out in PC hardware circles, know that there’s a veritable cottage industry of in-the-know insiders: anonymous but widely known tipsters like Greymon55 and kopite7kimi, who’ve shared enough accurate details on previous GPU and CPU launches that at least some of their sources are solid. Recently, unannounced Nvidia cards like the RTX 4070, RTX 4080 and especially the RTX 4090 have become this industry’s hottest commodities, meaning leakers are also the primary source of GeForce details for the gaming tech world at large.\r\n\n \nRead more",

A time when Saints Row and Saints Row 2 were lighthearted Grand Theft Auto alternatives, then Saints Row: The Third came along and cranked up the silliness, and then Saints Row 4 grabbed the lever and cranked it so hard it snapped. So, yes, this year's Saints Row reboot is technically Saints Row 5, except it’s more of a careful reboot. Where does it really sit on the timeline? At both ends, I reckon.\nRead more",

The latest iteration of FIFA’s motion-capture tech, cunningly named Hypermotion2, uses machine learning to generate animations based on “millions of frames of Advanced 11v11 Match Capture”, EA say.

It's an ethos encapsulated by the game’s own time loop, in which protagonist Colt Vahn relives the same day again and again as he searches for a way to break free of it - an idea that was, among other things, designed to encourage something hardcore Arkane fans had been doing already – replaying the game over and over again.\nWhile Dishonored had gently suggested repeat playthroughs with its kill/non-lethal runs, plenty of players still called it a day at the end of their first playthrough.

          "description": "Make sorting all those games a little easier\nA new beta is rolling out for the PlayStation 5 today, adding some much-requested features. 1440p video output, gamelists, and other updates are entering the PS5 beta for select participants today.\nOne big new feature is the ability to support 1440p HDMI video output, letting those who own 1440p monitors or TVs use the setting. If the game supports 1440p native output it will allow for it. Or, if at a higher resolution like 4K, the system can use supersampling.\nThe option is under the Screen and Video section here:\n\nPS5 beta gamelists\nGamelists are also headed into the beta, and this is likely a feature that every PlayStation 5 owner will want to see roll out soon. These are essentially like the PS4's folders, allowing players to sort their collection.\nUp to 15 gamelists and 100 games per gamelist are allowed. These lists can include disc, digital, and streaming, and the same game can be added to multiple gamelists. Finding what's still in your backlog should be a bit easier once this rolls out to everyone.\n\nMore PS5 beta features rolling out\nA few other updates are on the way too, including comparisons for 3D audio and stereo. In-progress activities will pop up at the top of the game hub, making it easier to hop back in.\nOn the social side, beta users can request party members to start sharing their screen. Basically, a \"let me watch you play\" button. And if you're in a party and someone starts up a joinable a game, a notification will pop up. Probably useful for all those Guilty Gear fight nights or Overwatch stacks.\nBeta users will also be able to send voice messages and stickers to each other, within their groups.\n\nThe beta is rolling out to invited participants today, and Sony's goal is to roll these features out later in the year. Hopefully it's sooner rather than later, because my PS5 home is getting a little cluttered.\nThe post PS5 gamelists, 1440p support and more go into beta today appeared first on Destructoid.",

(Accepting a friend request requires a Nintendo Switch console.)\n・ You are now able to copy your friend code as a URL and/or save it as a QR code, which others can then use to send you friend requests.\n・ Other minor changes have also been implemented.\n・ System requirements have been updated to iOS 14.0 or higher.\nAs you can see, the implications are pretty great overall. If you're randomly meeting someone for the first time, sharing a friend code is as simple as getting out your mobile device and making the exchange that way: even in the form of making a QR code for someone else to use on the spot.\nRemember of course that there has to be provisos because it's the friend code system. To accept it, you need to use the Switch console itself when you actually get home.

The anthropomorphic/steampunk RPG will bring its epic, turn-based action to PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms at some point in 2023.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OolRShEoq9I\nThe sequel to 2021's highly rated Fuga: Melodies of Steel and the fifth release in Cyberconnect2's Little Tail Bronx franchise, Fuga: Melodies of Steel 2 will see our band of survivors continue their voyage aboard the rickety but technologically adept battle tank — Taranis. Set against the thinly veiled backdrop of an alternate World War II, Fuga: Melodies of Steel blended turn-based action with high melodrama and a storyline of loss, sacrifice, and redemption. Themes that are expected to carry into the new sequel.\n\nWhile the developer has not offered too much in the way of information regarding the sequel's mechanics, Fuga 2 promises to boast a boosted and improved battle system, stronger strategy elements, and a brand new, choice-based storyline that will leave players with a roused spirit, a broken heart, and an empowered soul. My words, not theirs. I should probably note that. While understandably niche, the first release was a real hit with the fan community, who will no doubt receive today's sequel reveal with much joy. Fire up the Soul Cannon... Who is the ammunition this time around..?\nFuga: Melodies of Steel 2 will launch in 2023 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.

The studio also added the ability to open up the main menu (X) in-game and obtain delivery-based bonus items from the season pass. It also \"fixes some issues,\" which are likely last-minute development fixes. But in my experience throughout the entire game, I didn't really see many technical problems outside of some framerate drops in massive areas.\nWith that in mind, the physical edition is fairly well preserved already (so far, at least), as all you're getting is \"minor fixes\" and the ability to add in (mostly future) season pass content, which required an online connection anyway.\nYou can find the full notes here.\nXenoblade Chronicles 3 day one patch notes - Ver. 1.1.0:\nAdded the ability to receive items delivered in the Expansion Pass.\nThe main menu can be opened by pressing the X button during play.\nFixed some issues to make the game more comfortable to play.\nThe post The Xenoblade Chronicles 3 day one patch is thankfully minor appeared first on Destructoid.",

The furor led to all sorts of stock shortages and daily rule changes for the retailer, as it struggled to cope with the unending pressure from both Londoners and visitors traveling to the capital specifically for the cause. In total, some 30,000 customers shopped at the store within its four-week opening period.\nThe store was set to return in 2020 but was postponed due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nhttps://twitter.com/PokemonNewsUK/status/1552228398017265664?s=20&t=z80LaQjSZtEBGK9gmBYntg\nThe new Pokémon Center London is being established in conjunction with the Pokémon World Championships, which are being held at London's ExCel Centre between August 17-21. According to a new tweet, the outlet will feature merchandise, photo opportunities, and themed areas. Predicting a rush, the store will operate advanced visitor bookings, as well as a virtual queueing system. Given that the outlet is open for a mere weekend, it is incredibly likely that it will be an unprecedented success.\nIf you're looking to visit the store yourself, then be sure to follow the Pokémon UK Twitter account.

          "description": "These cats are quite possibly the antithesis of Stray\nThe countryside holds many secrets. And some of those are probably best left undiscovered. At least, that's what it seems like in The Excavation of Hob's Barrow, an upcoming horror adventure from Cloak and Dagger Games.\nCloak and Dagger are no stranger to horror or adventure, having explored the genres a fair bit in previous games. For The Excavation of Hob's Barrow, though, the studio is teaming up with Wadjet Eye Games as its publisher.\nWadjet Eye was founded by Dave Gilbert and has delivered a number of stellar adventure games, like Unavowed and The Shivah. This pairing up seems like one to watch for anyone who likes some creepy horror.\nThe Excavation follows antiquarian Thomasina Bateman, who's writing a book on the barrows of England. As she explores the countryside and documents the treasures she finds, Bateman is drawn to a small village called Bewlay. Things begin to get stranger and stranger, as the locals seem wary and her assistant never arrives. And then the dreams start.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWRzaySj0MA\nDon't go in the barrows\nWhile horror games are easy to find these days on Steam, folk horror has a bit of a different air to it. Jump scares are easy to find, but a town with some creepy atmosphere and probably some kind of ancient ritual? That's fresh and interesting.\nIt's been quite a week for unusual and interesting horror game reveals. We spotlighted Slay the Princess, an upcoming horror visual novel about a very scary princess, earlier this week. And now Hob's Barrow is adding more incredible art and creepy vibes to the mix.\nSeems like it's a good time ahead for fans of indie horror games. No date's been set yet, but The Excavation of Hob's Barrow is currently planned for a 2022 launch. You can find it on Steam here.\nThe post Search the barrows for hidden horrors in The Excavation of Hob’s Barrow later this year appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Gone but not forgotten\nRoblox is one of the most popular video games in the world, but even for those who don't play the game, a single sound effect has transcended into meme culture to become instantly recognizable: the \"oof\" death sound. In the wake of some ongoing licensing issues Roblox has had with sound effects, the team behind the game has announced that the infamous \"oof\" has been removed from the game entirely. They explained in a tweet from the official Roblox Twitter account that they \"created a replacement default sound\" and that they \"plan to expand [their] Avatar Shop with a whole range of both old and new sounds in the future.\"\nhttps://twitter.com/Roblox/status/1552037832578846720\nRoblox's trouble with the licensing for the sound started back in 2020, after the \"oof\" had pervaded online spaces, and video game composer Tommy Tallarico realized that was a sound he created for a game called Messiah. The \"oof\" was removed from Roblox back then as well, but was reintroduced after Tallarico reached an agreement with the developer, so that creators could buy access to the sound for about $1. It seems that the issue resurfaced and they weren't able to settle things this time, much to the dismay of fans who love the \"oof\" sound.\nThe tweet prior to the announcement of the sound's removal discusses the new plan for how sound effects will play a role in Roblox moving forward. The developer stated that they will be getting sounds \"directly from the creators and licensors,\" and that \"users will also be able to customize sounds for their avatars in the same way they customize clothing.\" That sounds like a pretty interesting step forward for the game, but I have to admit it feels like the end of an era with the \"oof\" sound effect being gone.\nThe post Roblox’s iconic “oof” sound effect is removed due to licensing issues appeared first on Destructoid.",

Well, Atlus asked that exact same question, and fans answered: Persona 3.\nThe results came via the Atlus Survey 2022 special program, where they were gathered by Persona Central.\nStuffed into one category (P3/FES/P3P), Persona 3 came out on top, but Persona 2 (Innocent Sin/Eternal Punishment) was right there too with roughly the same percentage of votes, coming in second. After that we have Revelations: Persona (Persona 1), then Persona 4 (+Golden), and Devil Summoner: Raidou rounding out the top five.\nI think I'd go with Persona 1 or Persona 2. The third, fourth, and fifth entries have been celebrated enough: it would be great to unify the entire series and have all five games in a palatable modern context, potentially even by the end of this console generation (or with some form of backward compatibility). With Persona 3-5 already being preserved again, it would round everything out.\nAtlus' Persona remake/Atlus game poll results:\nPersona 3 (P3 / P3FES / P3P) (78.9%)\nPersona 2: Innocent Sin / Persona 2: Eternal Punishment (78.9%)\nRevelations: Persona (76.3%)\nPersona 4 (P4G) (74.8%)\nDevil Summoner: Raidou Kuzunoha series (72.1%)\nDevil Summoner: Soul Hackers (69.5%)\nShin Megami Tensei IV: Apocalypse (66.7%)\nShin Megami Tensei IV (65.3%)\nDigital Devil Saga: Avatar Tuner series (62.4%)\nEtrian Odyssey series (58%)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cISLbrNyg5U\nThe post Persona 2 and 3 won the official Atlus most-requested remake poll appeared first on Destructoid.",

Cena will be dropping onto the landing zone on all platforms July 29, kitted out with his trademark jorts, inflatable finger melee tool, WWE title \"Back Bling,\" and iconic \"You Can't C Me\" taunt. Unfortunately, it does not appear that playing as Cena will afford you the ability to hit your opponents with the Attitude Adjustment.\nI expect Cena to be banned from online play almost immediately given his natural camouflage abilities.\n\nFor those of you who prefer your battle arts of the vehicular persuasion, then Rocket League is also currently feeling the pro-wrestling vibe. From July 28, players can purchase brand-new octane decals for their road rippers of choice. The two new designs are styled after the color schemes and shirt logos of both John Cena and the current Undisputed WWE Universal Champion, Roman Reigns.\nThe WWE SummerSlam Octane Decal Bundle will retail for 500 credits.\n\nFinally, over in the cutesy bean-bashing world of Fall Guys, three new costumes are headed to the in-game store. These outfits are stylized after three top WWE stars: The video game-lovin' Xavier Woods, legendary deadman The Undertaker, and yer boy Moyse's favorite, Asuka. These three skins will be available to purchase within Fall Guys during this week's \"Blundermania\" promotion, which will take place between July 28 and August 1.\nThe post WWE stars headed to Fortnite, Rocket League, and Fall Guys in new crossover events appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Merrie Melodies\nYesterday, Warner Bros. Games launched the open beta for its incoming platform fighter MultiVersus, allowing players on both PC and console platforms to step into the ring with its crossover cast of pop culture characters. Already, the MultiVersus beta has seen incredible success, becoming the fourth most popular title on just the Steam platform alone.\nThe PC dashboard logged an incredible 144,000 players at its peak yesterday, surpassing launch day numbers for any other fighting game on the platform — including Street Fighter, Tekken, and Mortal Kombat. It should be noted, of course, that MultiVersus is a free-to-play title, but that's still a staggering amount of players. When you add in players on Xbox and PlayStation, we could easily be looking at the most popular fighting game beta of all time.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAydKj4j0IA\nOf course, these numbers lead to some particularly sweaty servers, and some players found themselves struggling to log in during Tuesday's peak activity period. A fighting game lives and dies on the longevity of its community, so while these numbers are unlikely to be retained, MultiVersus will be looking to hook in enough regulars to keep the fists and fur flying over the coming weeks, months, and perhaps years — though Player First Games' implementation of crossplay will certainly aid this goal.\nIf you want to check out the slapstick silliness for yourself, then the MultiVersus beta is available on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms right now. All you need do is download the game client on your platform of choice, sign in with a WB Games account, and you're ready to rock. The \"full\" version of MultiVersus will launch later in 2022.\nThe post MultiVersus open beta already seeing massive player numbers appeared first on Destructoid.",

Bloomberg reports that Aspyr Media's KOTOR remake is on hold, after hitting some development troubles.\nThe remake was announced last year, during the PlayStation Showcase 2021. It's in development at Aspyr Media, an Austin-based studio that has built up a portfolio of ports, especially in the Star Wars franchise.\nBloomberg reports that Aspyr has fired the KOTOR remake's art director and design director this month. Following a series of meetings, sources tell Bloomberg that the project is on pause. Aspyr is reportedly looking for new contracts and development opportunities.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lL-RfE-ioJ8\nThis comes after a demo was reportedly finalized at the end of June, showing off a slice of the Knights of the Old Republic remake. Studio heads told staff the slice wasn't where they wanted it to be.\nBloomberg's sources point to two issues, via sources familiar with the matter. One is that the project may not have been sustainable on its current course, given the amount of time and money invested in the demo. The other is the timeline. While Aspyr may have been targeting the end of 2022, according to Bloomberg's sources, a more realistic target would be 2025.\nA galaxy far, far away\nThis news is disheartening for those hoping to see some KOTOR sooner rather than later. Saber Interactive, another studio under the Embracer umbrella, joined on the project earlier this year to assist development. Aspyr announced its intent to acquire Beamdog, which has some RPG talent in tow, in April. The Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake is still officially planned as a timed exclusive for PlayStation 5 and PC.\nNeither Aspyr Media nor Embracer Group immediately responded to Bloomberg.\nThe post The Star Wars KOTOR remake has reportedly been put on hold appeared first on Destructoid.",

That’s the news as reported by Bloomberg earlier today, which cited unnamed sources close to its development, relaying that the project has been paused.\nThe problems reportedly stem from major staff departures at developer, Aspyr Media. Specifically, both the art director and the design director were unexpectedly let go from the company. A recent vertical slice demo of the game was well received by license holders. However, later messaging to the rest of the development team suggested that the project wasn’t where studio leadership wanted it to be.\nDevelopers at Aspyr are reportedly now stating that 2025 would be a realistic time frame to expect the project to release. \nStar Wars: Knights of the Old Republic holds a special place in video game history. The original 2003 game was a significant milestone in successful and original video game storytelling in the Star Wars franchise and featured a memorable twist regarding a main character’s identity. The game also helped popularize some of the choice-driven and moral decision-making that became so popular in later games like Mass Effect.\nThe remake is highly anticipated by longtime fans, but its future now appears murky.\n[Source: Bloomberg]",

It wasn't exactly the Black Flag follow-up many, including myself, had anticipated, but with Ubisoft Singapore, the studio behind the Assassin's Creed franchise's excellent naval combat, at the helm, I wanted to see more. \nAfter another look at it in 2018, Skull and Bones went dark, and Ubisoft remained mostly silent on the title for years.

You can pick up a set that includes a “you can’t see me” emote, WWE Championship Title Back Bling, and Five Digit Slapper pickaxe. Personally, I’m chuckling at the idea of the PG-friendly Cena adjusting attitudes with guns instead of bodyslams. \nWhile Cena isn’t the first wrestler to appear in Fornite – Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson has him beat there – it’s cool to see regardless, and, as a wrestling fan, I hope this trend continues. Fortnite already acts as the ultimate “forbidden door” for various media properties, so let's throw more sports entertainment into the mix by adding stars from WWE, AEW, Impact, New Japan, and other promotions.

By hitting a button or using the Card in the Control Center, you can disable game footage and see your surroundings without removing the headset. This is thanks to the device’s embedded front cameras, making it less of a hassle when you need to check on something in the real world. Sony also notes that this mode is for viewing only; you can’t use it to record. You can, however, broadcast yourself while playing PS VR2 games by connecting a PS5 HD camera to the consoles. \nThe play area, as in the virtual boundaries allotted for VR play, can now be customized. You can use the headset cameras and Sense controllers to scan the room and dynamically map out the play space to your liking. These settings are then saved until you move to a different play area. \nLastly, PS VR2 sports two viewing modes: VR and Cinematic. VR mode displays VR content in a 360 degree view in 4000 x 2040 HDR video format (2000 x 2040 per eye) and 90Hz/120Hz frame rate. Cinematic Mode lets players view non-VR media and the PS5 interface in 1920×1080 HDR video format with 24/60Hz and 120Hz frame rate.\nPlayStation VR2 still doesn’t have a release window, but Sony promises to share more information “soon.” That includes its launch line-up, which is said to consist of at least 20 games. Titles being developed for the headset include Horizon: Call of the Mountain, ports of Resident Evil Village and No Man’s Sky, and The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners Ch. 2.\nWhat do you think of these features for PlayStation VR2?

We will update you with an exact timing in the near future.\n\nWe are grateful for our passionate community and we cannot wait to share this unique adventure with you soon!\n\nDaedalic Entertainment\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: Gollum was announced in 2019 and chronicles Gollum's life after he loses the One Ring during the early chapters of The Fellowship of the Ring. The game emphasizes platforming and stealth as players climb and sneak across environments. Players can attack enemies depending on if they side with the character's Gollum or Smeagol personalities. \nDo you think The Lord of the Rings: Gollum needs a delay? Let us know in the comments!",

          "description": "Xbox Insider testers noticed a faster boot-up time for their consoles, revealing Microsoft’s recent initiatives to get players into their games quicker. According to The Verge, the cold boot-up time is now estimated to be around 5 seconds. The trick to the faster time lies in a shorter animation. \nCan confirm - worked with @harrisonhoffman and @jakerose27 to create a shorter boot up animation (~4s) from the original boot up animation (~9s), helping to reduce the overall startup time.\nJuly 23, 2022\nThe director of Integrated Marketing at Xbox stated (see above) worked alongside the principal product manager for connected TV apps, Harrison Hoffman, and senior product manager lead Jake Rosenberg to “create a shorter boot up animation (~4s) from the original boot up animation (~9s), helping to reduce the overall startup time.” However, there is a catch. You’ll have to set your Series X/S to Energy Saver mode to benefit from the faster boot-up. This means the console will completely power off when you decide to put the controller down and do something else. Nevertheless, this benefits the environment and helps drop the monetary load of electricity bills. \nUltimately, the boot-up is down from 20 seconds to 15 seconds. That might seem negligible at first glance, but perhaps we’ll reach a period when wait times are nonexistent. \n[Source: The Verge]",

This creature arrives on August 1 within a free title update for players on Switch and PC.\nCapcom released a minute-long trailer that shows a battle against the Lucent Nargacuga within the Forlorn Arena, backed by beautiful moonlight. The wyvern can cloak to evade its attackers and spin within the blink of an eye to knock them back.\nIn our review for Sunbreak, John Carson said the game needs more threats. \"The lack of new monsters plagues the early hours, but there’s plenty to love if you keep at it,\" he wrote. \"The added flexibility of the Switch Skill Swap system is a freeing and fun expansion to combat for hardcore hunters and the new creatures in the Master Rank quests – when you get to them – breathe life into the experience. For someone already invested in Monster Hunter, there’s plenty to love in Sunbreak.\"\nThis title update brings at least one new beast to hunt. Here's hoping players stumble upon more as the world opens up and the new content is unearthed.",

As you explore the post-apocalyptic world, have you given it one yourself? If so, what name have you settled on? \nAdmittedly, I’m still figuring that out myself. I still have a good ways to go in Stray, and I’ve batted around a few options as I hopped across rooftops and meowed at robots. Some are more elaborate, like \"Chester A.

          "description": "A not-so-long time ago in the same galaxy we all reside in, Respawn Entertainment deviated from its first-person shooter roots to create Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66. After he’s outed by the Sith, he embarks on a quest to recover an artifact capable of locating force-sensitive children while also avoiding capture by the Inquisitors, who are elite Jedi hunters. \nThe game features a blend of lightsaber combat and a suite of Force abilities. Borrowing inspiration from FromSoftware’s Soul series, encounters are challenging, requiring a strategic blend of blocks and parries to outduel opponents. Meanwhile, the various planets take on a Metroid-inspired progression with players unlocking abilities to backtrack to previously inaccessible areas. \nWatch on Twitch!\nFallen Order was released on November 15, 2019, and was a critical and financial success. It also served as a saving grace for single-player fans, providing proof to an increasingly multiplayer-focused EA that linear story-driven experiences can still make the big bucks. With a sequel reportedly in the works, we’re revisiting this gem of the Star Wars video game pantheon. \nJoin Marcus Stewart, Andrew Reiner, and, making his Replay debut, GI web designer/programmer Jon Woodey on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central as we journey through the entirety of Cal Kestis’ adventure. Expect plenty of laughs, deaths, and general nerding out over all things Star Wars. We encourage you to hang out with us in chat.

          "description": "Resident Evil Village Gold Edition arrives in October and introduces the Winters’ story expansion. This content update includes an expanded version of the game’s Mercenaries mode, introducing Chris Redfield, Karl Heisenberg, and Lady Dimitrescu as playable characters. A new trailer shows off each of their abilities and how players can tear through hordes of monstrosities as this powerful trio. \n\n\nThe update, called The Mercenaries Additional Orders, adds two new stages, Bloody Village and Bloody River, and lets players mow down adversaries such as the weapon-strapped Chris Redfield. When his arsenal of guns isn’t enough, the former BSAA agent packs a powerful punch that can have foes reeling, and activating his Onslaught gauge grants him an absurd speed boost, letting him move and reload in the blink of an eye. When all else fails, Chris can call in support strikes by pinpointing targets with his locator. \nIf you want to get your Magneto on, Heisenberg can use his electromagnetic powers to toss buzzsaws and other objects, channel lightning, and smash foes with his massive hammer. He can also call in his Soldat Jets to lend a hand. \nThe towering Lady D handles threats by slicing them to bits with her intimidating claws, which builds up a Thrill meter. Spending this meter allows her to use special moves such as summoning her psychotic daughters. Hilariously, the trailer even shows Dimitrescu tossing her bedroom dresser at a mob, a goofy callback to when she destroyed the same piece of furniture during the main campaign. \nIf you already own Resident Evil Village, you can purchase the Winter’s Expansion standalone to access the new Mercenaries content. Resident Evil Village Gold Edition is an all-in-one package that includes the base game and the expansion. Both will launch on October 28.",

In the trailer above, we see her acrobatic maneuvers make short work of a gang. The footage also shows what appears to be a boss fight and a couple of alternate skins that players can unlock for Barbara Gordon.\nSlated to release on October 25 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, Gotham Knights tells the story of a Batman-less superhero world and shows how his wards rise to take his place. The playable characters are Robin, Nightwing, Red Hood, and Batgirl. You can play whoever you want, and it won't disrupt the game's cooperative play. Warner Bros. allows two Batgirls to run together, should players wish to attain an Elseworlds vibe.\nThe skins shown in the video will likely need to be unlocked by finding blueprints and acquiring the proper crafting materials to build them.\nFollowing the success of Rocksteady's Arkham series and Warner Bros. Montreal's contribution, Gotham Knights has enormous shoes to fill. Here's hoping it's every bit as good as the titles mentioned. We need another great Arkham-like game.",

          "description": "Ubisoft has reportedly canceled several in-development titles, including the previously announced Ghost Recon Frontline and Splinter Cell VR.\nThe publisher announced the cancellations in an investor call, part of the same earnings report that revealed the delay of Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. Ghost Recon Frontline was a battle royale take on the franchise unveiled last October. It boasted 100+ player matches and was positioned as Ubisoft's next big live-service title. Outside of a planned closed beta that never came to pass, Frontline never had a release window, and the game was heavily criticized by fans who wanted a more traditional Ghost Recon experience. You can watch the reveal trailer below. \n\n\nSplinter Cell VR was revealed in September 2020, and it was to be a brand-new Splinter Cell title made from the ground up for virtual reality. The game hadn’t made much of a peep since then. Assassin’s Creed VR, which was revealed alongside it, still seems to be happening, though. \nUbisoft CFO Frederick Duguet told investors that canceling these titles and the two announced projects was a cost-cutting measure to emphasize “even more focus on our biggest development opportunities.\" \nWhat do you think of these cancellations?

The news comes from Ubisoft’s quarterly sales report. \nUnfortunately, the report, which you can view here, doesn’t narrow down Avatar’s release window more than that. According to The Verge, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot explained in the earnings call that the company plans to make the Avatar franchise a larger gaming brand and that, in regards to Frontiers of Pandora, “It is important for us that we come with something that is perfect.”\nUbisoft had been quiet on Frontiers of Pandora since its big reveal during E3 2021, but it was assumed the game would launch sometime this holiday to coincide with the December 16 theatrical premiere of Avatar: The Way of Water. The first-person action game is built in the Snowdrop Engine, and players control a Na’vi in a new area of Pandora called the Western Frontier. Frontiers of Pandora is being developed by Massive Entertainment, the team behind The Divison. You can watch the E3 reveal trailer below.",

          "description": "Dragon Ball: The Breakers offers a unique spin on the franchise by letting a team of players work together to evade a player-controlled villain in asymmetrical fashion. A new trailer puts on a spotlight on one of those baddies, Lord Frieza, while also confirming an October launch date. \nFor those unaware, The Breakers tasks a team of non-superhuman civilians (including Bulma and Oolong) with escaping the clutches of a powerful mastermind who has imprisoned them in a pocket dimension of sorts. This overseer, known as the Raider, ups the ante by pitting these ordinary captives against powerful antagonists such as Cell, Majin Buu, and, of course, Frieza. The townsfolk can work together or separately to escape to a time machine by using various tools and can apparently harness and utilize the abilities of heroes such as Goku. \nThe new trailer highlights Frieza, showing how players can rain destruction as the emperor of the universe. This player can assume all of Frieza’s traditional transformations (his Golden form is unconfirmed) and unleash attacks such as his planet-destroying Death Ball. He even “Krillins” a victim by pulling them into the air and blowing them up. \n\n\nDragon Ball: The Breakers continues to look as wild as it does humorous, which certainly falls in line with the franchise. It’s launching on October 14 for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC. Curious fans will get to try the game beforehand, thanks to a series of closed network tests taking place on the weekend of August 6-7. You can register for that here.",

Shortly after the 1991 launch of the Blue Blur’s debut game on Sega Genesis, his popularity rivaled Nintendo’s behemoth Super Mario franchise. However, much like the roller coasters that inspired Sonic’s original gameplay and level design, the subsequent decades included plenty of highs and lows. Even after a quick jump off the starting line, many feared the series was doomed to fall short of its potential forever.\nHowever, the brand has experienced something of a renaissance in recent years. The Sonic the Hedgehog franchise is perhaps nearly as popular now as when it burst onto the scene just over three decades ago, bolstered by blockbuster movies, beloved comics, and promising streaming shows. Sonic Mania proved a successful retro reinvention, but the core development staff at Sonic Team has yet to deliver the final piece of the puzzle: a mainline game restoring the series’ legacy as one of the premier platformers.\nSega and Sonic Team think they have that final component with Sonic Frontiers. I traveled to Burbank, California, the American headquarters of Sonic Team, to sink hours into the upcoming open-world game to see if it truly is the fresh direction the franchise needs.\nRead more...",

Players can spacewalk on exterior walkways on their ship, which will provide views of the denser, more varied asteroid fields. Constructing manufacturing facilities lets players produce food and other resources, and you can construct other massive structures upon your capital ship.

          "description": "Far from describing a game with adventure in it (that would include a lot of games!), the adventure genre is loosely defined as one that emphasizes narrative and exploration over action, which may also rely on light puzzle mechanics. In other words, a game that doesn’t have enough simulation to be a sim, action to be an action title, puzzle-solving to be a puzzle game, and… you get the idea. Despite the nebulous classification, games in this genre are unambiguously incredible experiences, often exploring refreshing and fascinating concepts. Shooting for games that are rolling around in the zeitgeist right now, some of the genres’ towering giants are not listed here. However, for anyone looking to check out today’s great experiences, feel free to peruse our list of the best adventure games …",

          "description": "We learned in April that the Switch-exclusive No More Heroes 3 was expanding its horizons to other platforms, but now we know Travis Touchdown’s latest adventure makes the move in October.\nA flashy new trailer reveals that on October 11, No More Heroes 3 migrates to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. These versions take advantage of their more powerful homes by boasting sharper HD visuals, improved framerates, and faster loading. \n\n\nNo More Heroes 3 first arrived on Switch in August 2021. Former GI editor John Carson scored the game a 7.75 out of 10, writing in his review: \n“My time with No More Heroes 3 jumped between the short highs from entertaining bosses and cutscenes to long, ugly stretches in the world. Much of the design is dated, and I wanted to drop it after a few bosses to avoid the mundanity, but I’m happy I saw it to completion. There are many fun moments, and I love how unafraid it is to be strange or referential. Those who are already invested in the tale of Travis Touchdown should be right at home in this new No More Heroes. Still, I’d insist newcomers try out previous entries before diving into this Garden of Insanity.”",

Despite the sad news, the studio announced its commitment to the space opera franchise commending other leaders on the design team, from narrative director Ashley Ruhl to lead producer Eric Musco, and stating that the remaining developers will \"carry forward our vision for the game.\"\nThe blog post ended with a few heartfelt words from Boyd: \nLast December marked the Old Republic's 10th anniversary. The game's seventh expansion, Legacy of the Sith, was released around that time. Moreover, an upcoming content update promising new daily mission arcs for Republic and Imperial players on Manaan, a challenging operation for 8-player teams, improvements to weapons, and juicy story deets surrounding Darth Malgus is in development. The classic adventure in a galaxy far, far away is still going strong even as BioWare pivots to the next highly-anticipated chapters in the Mass Effect and Dragon Age franchises.",

Gamers can once again relive their childhood with the announcement of an incredible Lego Atari 2600 set. \n\nThe Verge reports that the buildable model is reminiscent of the 1980 revision rather than the debuted console from 1977. At 2,532 pieces, the set includes the console itself, which, when opened, reveals a miniature 1980s living room, a controller with a movable joystick, and three game cartridges: Asteroids, Adventure, and Centipede. In a press release, designer Chris McVeigh emphatically said, “We hope that building this classic console takes you back to those halcyon days when a handful of pixels meant a world of adventure.”\nThe Lego Atari 2600 releases on August 1 (this year marks Atari’s 50th anniversary!) and is priced at $239.99. Will you be securing a set for yourself?\n[Source: The Verge]",

Asakura might've inadvertently captured images from Yakuza 8 or the Like a Dragon sequel, but without any further context, the truth remains a mystery. You can watch the video below. \n\n\nLike a Dragon's protagonist, Ichiban Kasuga, and his friends appear in multiple screenshots. The charming hero's afro days are behind him as he now sports slicked-back hair and a ponytail. Based on a Famitsu report that Nibel translated (see below), Yakuza 8 takes place in a new location, and Mikuru Asakura makes an appearance.  \nThe off-screen screenshots are the first peak at Yakuza 8 (part of a behind-the-scenes YouTube video)\nJuly 19, 2022\nIn any case, Ichiban bore his way into our hearts in 2020. Jeff Cork reviewed Like a Dragon and said:\n\"Like a Dragon is a departure from the games that came before it, but I found those changes to be revitalizing. As much as I enjoyed the Yakuza formula, it was definitely a formula. Like a Dragon has enough familiar elements to make it feel like, at its heart, it's a Yakuza game. All the while, I fully appreciated how much of a new identity this entry is establishing. Here's hoping this is the first step in yet another great journey for the series.\"\n\nI'm excited to see Ichiban's next adventure, whether it's a numbered entry in the franchise or not. \n[Source: Famitsu via VGC]",

          "description": "In 2016, nothing was bigger than Pokémon Go. Mobs of people roamed cities and parks, disrupting traffic in the name of finding the next Pokémon needed to inch closer towards a completed Poké Dex. While the mainstream fervor surrounding Niantic's smash hit has settled significantly, it's still one of the most popular mobile titles in the app stores, surpassing $6 billion in revenue last month. \nThe Pokémon Trading Card Game has recently released special collections commemorating the 25th anniversary of the franchise, the Detective Pikachu movie, and plenty more, but it feels long overdue for Pokémon Go to finally get an expansion devoted to it. That changed this month, as the Pokémon Trading Card Game finally released a special collaboration with the popular mobile title. The expansion is not available through standard booster packs, instead offering boosters exclusively through Elite Trainer Boxes, Battle Decks, Collections, and Tins.\nWe were sent several boxes of this special expansion. As I opened the cards, I noticed the cards tend to feature more Pokémon from Gen I than other generations, which makes sense given the game's peak popularity. That said, various cards I pulled featured Pokémon like Tyranitar, Dragonite, and Blissey, who have, at one point, stood atop the in-game meta of Pokémon Go. It's nice to see those homages, alongside the most iconic Pokémon, the human characters from Pokémon Go, and items like Egg Incubators, Lure Modules, and PokéStops, which are essential parts of the mobile game. This pack also features peel-away Ditto cards, Pokémon exploring photorealistic settings, and Radiant Pokémon. And of course, there's Meltan and Melmetal, who both debuted through Pokémon Go.\nYou can see the large collection of my favorite pulls from this expansion in the gallery below.\n\nThe Pokémon Trading Card Game: Pokémon Go expansion launched on July 1. For all things Pokémon Trading Card Game, head to our special hub by clicking on the banner below!",
