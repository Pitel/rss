          "description": "Slice to kill.\nThe problem with the term ‘Metroidvania’ is that it’s a far broader genre classification than some give it credit for. Depending on where they fall on the spectrum between the exploration-heavy Metroid series and the combat-centric Castlevania series, it’s possible for two games to both be considered Metroidvanias while playing, looking, and sounding nothing alike. Neither extreme is more valid than the other. What’s important is understanding which portions of the genre a given title is committed to, and whether it’s successful.\nIt’s not enough to simply call Blade Chimera a great Metroidvania and leave it at that. What Team Ladybug (Record of Lodoss War: Deedlit in Wonder Labyrinth, Drainus) has cooked up here is a game that is impressively clear-eyed in identifying its priorities — which just so happen to mirror many of the tenets of Konami’s legendary vampire hunting series — and executing on them to incredible effect. It doesn’t do everything one might expect a Metroidvania to do, but its particular bright spots are blinding to behold.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Back then, the title said it all: not only was Donkey Kong back, but Donkey Kong Country had indeed returned. That’s not quite the world we’re living in 15 years later.\nHaving said that, just like the original, Donkey Kong Country Returns HD explains everything you need to know about it in the title: it’s Donkey Kong Country Returns in HD, and unfortunately, it’s not much more than that.

It's from a team led by a former S.T.A.L.K.E.R. developer, too, and those S.T.A.L.K.E.R. alumni certainly know how to post a good apocalypse.

Just me? I need to get out the mould spray more often.\r\n\n\r\nOK, how about when you were a kid and you lifted up a nice, round stone and the damp, fertile soil beneath writhed away from you in a fervent knotting of pellucid, boneless bodies and the tickling of a thousand little legs? Right. Anoxia Station is that and also, a turn-based strategy game about drilling for oil. The recently released Itch.io demo is rough around the edges, but I do adore the vibe.\r\n \nRead more",

This code base is fucking awful. Like, I can't put stuff together easily. I'm running into bugs everywhere. But now shit just works!\"\nYou might know Sam Prebble as Trigger Happy Interactive, the solo developer behind frenetic FPS Turbo Overkill. Before that he went by a different name, attached to a very different project. Total Chaos, first released in 2018 under the moniker Wadaholic, is a total conversion mod for Doom 2. With its focus on a thick survival horror atmosphere of tension and disempowerment, it's about as far removed from Turbo Overkill's manic, Doom Eternal-inspired action as a game can get. As Prebble puts it, the only thing the two projects have in common is the first person perspective. Even so, he found himself returning to Total Chaos after wrapping development on Turbo Overkill, resulting in the standalone remake. \nRead more",

          "description": "Like it or not, horror gaming is often built on jump scares. Deriding a good cheap scare ignores the endorphin rush that draws so many players to the genre, in the same way that the \"elevated horror\" trend forfeits some of the soul of schlocky slasher flicks and ghost movies. Don’t get me wrong, Silent Hill and Alan Wake deserve their flowers - but even those games would wither on the screen if Pyramid Head didn’t bust through a wall from time to time.\nOne unsung jump scare game in particular pioneered horror in the internet age, blazing everywhere from nascent social media to major television networks. In fact, if you had an internet connection circa 2005, there’s a good chance you played it. Alas, it was too ahead of its time, too successful at leveraging virality before viral horror was sought after. Next time you see a streamer throw their headphones across the room in fright, beware: the spirit of Scary Maze Game is right behind you.\nRead more",

I was bracing to send the good news to developers Skyglow Softworks that, so far, nobody has managed to copyright “space”, though I’m sure somebody’s tried. Maybe, um, God? \r\n\n\r\nIt’s a relief to know that God won’t be suing Skyglow Softworks for breach of copyright, because off the back of two demo missions, Annihilate The Spance is worryingly compelling. It’s a mixture of space RTS and autobattler, wherein you construct bases that produce spanceships who autopilot towards the nearest and largest concentration of enemies. According to the developers, it’s inspired by the 2011 Flash game Obliterate Everything by CWWallis (RIP), which I dimly recall playing while I was running a browser game blog for AOL.

There's a parallel story about your character and his role in a magical order of destiny godlings I didn't find the least bit interesting, but the rest is thrilling because Romance is already thrilling. The parts that Origins bogs down with its wordier take on already wordy source material are enlivened again by anime vibrance, hijinks, and melodrama.\nRead more",

Coming soon to press that advantage are the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 9 9900X3D, a pair of even higher-spec processors that headlined AMD’s plethora of CES 2025 hardware announcements.\nNo pricing (or exact release date) on these yet, but they both up the core and thread counts over the 9800X3D while peaking at higher boost clock speeds. And, of course, they share the same 3D V-Cache design that makes the 9800X3D such a superlative CPU in the first place. If you don’t know what this is and how it helps game performance, imagine how much faster you could eat Wotsits if you had a massive bucket of them on your desk at all times, instead of having to get up and walk to the kitchen to grab individual packs. In this case the Wotsits are data, the bucket is 3D V-Cache, and the hastened ruination of your digestive system is games running faster.\nRead more",

They managed to complete it in less than five minutes. Not only does the run (and its helpful commentary) serve as a short and sweet explanation of why Barbuta is so glitchily fascinating, it also left plenty of time to marathon another three games from the collection. \nRead more",

One was a cheesy round-up of the best manboobs in video games for Green Man Gaming's long-vanished blog. It was published sometime in 2010, and IIRC, pre-reboot Kratos came out on top. I think/hope it still exists somewhere in the apparatus of Green Man Gaming, hidden beneath the retailer's veneer of respectability like a barrel of radioactive waste. The other boob article was a piece for OXM about Ken Levine saying that he wished people would stop fixating on Elizabeth's cleavage in Bioshock Infinite - a complaint we might consider slightly hypocritical, given the character's visual design.\nNow it's time for boob article number 3: some modder has given 122 of the 150 Jokers in cardgame Balatro big chests. This extends from visibly human Jokers to Joker concepts that shouldn't, strictly speaking, have the capacity for boobage. The banana card has boobs, for example. The credit card card has boobs.

You will supposedly drive sports cars, shoot guns at people, and accrue in-game cash.

Look at that capital \"C\", poking out of the middle like the bow on a present whose silhouette leaves nothing to the imagination. You already know broadly what this game involves, yes? Indeed, you do: it's a game about crafting spacecraft, so that you can travel to other planets and craft their resources into other, better spacecraft. This you may do eternally, for there are thousands of planets in store.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "I think the last time I read an actual, original Garfield comic was in 1998. Since then, my experience of the character has been one long litany of Gar-memes and in particular, Gorefield memes. For those blissfully unaware, Gorefield is a version of Jim Davis’s otiose, lasagna-loving housecat who has broken his comic strip shackles and become a cosmic abomination. Gorefield's manifestations are many: centipede Gorefields, arachnid Gorefields, Gorefields that extend serpentine necks of unfleshed bone towards a cowering Jon Arbuckle, demanding to be fed in a voice that sounds nothing like Bill Murray, a voice as deep and velvety as the eternal Monday before the Big Bang.\nIn Gar-Type, a free Gorefield fangame from Youtuber and pixel artist LumpyTouch, Garfield has become a planet. The good news is that, unlike many other Gore-variants, this Gorefield is vulnerable to bullets. It falls to ace pilot Jon Starbuckle and his prototype starfighter, Gar-Type D, to save the Earth from lasagnnihilation.\n Read more",

I think that's the big theme of my selection box: being grounded within my player character. I want to feel what it's like to hike through canyons with too much sellable loot in my backpack. I want to park my soul in the head of a scared Scotsman way out of his depth, hundreds of miles from shore. The closer I can comfortably fit in my character's shoes, the more I seem to buy into the world they inhabit. Even if that world is constantly glowing a magnificent crimson. \nRead more",

          "description": "My selection box isn't really a selection box. It's a tray of barely-nibbled leftovers, hastily lifted from my Steam backlog. One of the disadvantages of being news editor, you see, is that I have  developed a goldfish-grade attention span. In my hectic pursuit of the next scoop, or the next Elden Ring update changelog, I snatch and cast aside game demos like a pickpocket speedrunning the checkout line at Harvey Nichols. I'm dimly aware that some of these cast-aside games are Very Good. A few might even deserve to be played for longer than 30 minutes. I feel immensely guilty about that. Perhaps a little... existential, too. I have measured out my life in tutorial levels. \r\n\n\r\nSo! Rather than digging out three of the games I've actually completed this year, such as The Crush House, Death Of A Wish and Mask Quest, I'm going to gamble on recommending a few I've barely scratched, but which sure feel excellent and have attracted a positive critical consensus. If I am false in this assessment, may Horace the Endless Bear bite my head off for my impudence. Let's begin.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Chcete se pochlubit technickými vánočními dárky? Pak doražte na Virtuální Bastlírnu - online pokec (nejen) techniků a bastlířů!\r\n\r\n\r\nPokud by se konverzace zadrhla, mají organizátoři ze Strahovské Bastlírny připravena i náhradní výplňová témata. Velká studnice je to, co se dělo na hackerské konferenci CCC (Chaos Communication Conference) mezi svátky - mluvilo se tam o tom, jak se dá shodit rozvodná síť po rádiu, jak hacknout nový procesor Raspberry RP2350 a o tom jak pokračuje hackování vlaků v Polsku.\r\n\r\n\r\nI na svět hardware jsou Strahováci připraveni. Na internetu se objevil postup, jak \"snadno\" vyrábět doma plošné spoje s pomocí výkonného vláknového laseru. Také se v diskuzi našel skvělý spis o tom, jak poznat falešné teploměry DS18B20 a co to vlastně znamená.\r\n\r\n\r\nA nebojte, i na bizár může dojít. Věděli jste, že největší sériově vyráběná CRT televize váží přibližně 200 kilogramů a na světě se už ví jenom o jedné existující? A že Windows interně zkoušejí konvertovat znaky z UTF-16 do ASCII podle jejich grafické podobnosti, což vede k velkému množství elegantních exploitů?\r\n\r\n\r\nPříští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat v úterý 14. ledna od 20:00 (pozor, změna) minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.",

Now, it's getting ready to explore the world further with a \"huge game expansion\" called In the Dark.\n\n\nAccording to developer MegaWobble, the In the Dark expansion doubles the size of Lil Gator Game. As the title and key art implies, this one takes our adorable hero underground to explore caves, with the promise of meeting a bunch of new characters in the process. You can head underground for yourself in the announcement trailer below.\n\n\n\n\nThe new content is located on the main island within a previously blocked entrance. In addition to the new friends awaiting Lil Gator, there are also some teenage ne'er-do-wells threatening to put a stop to the cozy frivolity to which we've become so thoroughly accustomed. New item types, a ribbon-powered double jump, and more are on the way to add to the exploratory opportunities. \n\n\nLil Gator Game: In the Dark is currently in the works for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S and Nintendo Switch. At the time of this writing, there's no release date in place for the expansion, but there are options for both newcomers and returning players. The expansion will arrive alongside a 'Gator of the Year Edition' of the main game that bundles it with all the new content. \n\n\nIn the meantime, if you want to see if the game is right for you, you can always check it out on Game Pass. \n\nThe post Lil Gator Game reveals ‘huge’ In the Dark expansion appeared first on Destructoid.",

Season 2 aims to bring even more to the table, introducing The Tomb, an ancient burial site overrun by hordes of zombies. \n\n\nAs a catacombs-based location, The Tomb reminds me of the good old days with Black Ops 2's Zombies Buried map. However, this area seems a bit more open, as you have the free range to go deep in the catacombs or outside an excavation site.

          "description": "The Heian Sukuna Moveset is now live in Jujutsu Shenanigans, and you can get it quite easily on a private server.\n\n\nThe move set is one of the many additions made as part of the latest update. While the process isn't impossibly difficult by any means, it's not exactly easy as well. Let's take a look at how you can obtain this moveset in a private server.\n\n\nHow to obtain the Heian Sukuna Moveset in Jujutsu Shenanigans (Private Server)\n\n\nHaving a private server allows you certain extra benefits. For example, you can spawn certain things as you want. The first step to get the moveset is to spawn four blocks in a line. Make sure there is space between them. Select the first moveset and scroll down to Divergent. Once found, assign 5 to this Move Key.\n\n\nDo the same for the next one, and assign 6 to it. Change the Input ID to two letters, and they can be as per your choice. But do remember to make them the same for all. Increase the size of the blocks to make them bigger than your character.\n\n\n\n\nNow, add a touch block to cover all four blocks, and enter the Output ID. This should be the same as the Input ID that you set for all four moveset blocks. Next, just walk through all the boxes, and you'll have your moveset.\n\n\nIf you're wondering why you need to do this in a private server, the reason is simple: it's unavailable in the full game. Once the next update is available, you should be able to unlock the Heian Era Sukuna moveset in the full game. Till then, the private server is the only available option if you want to test out its strengths and weaknesses.\n\nThe post How To Get Heian Era Sukuna Moveset In Jujutsu Shenanigans appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "In a trailer published through IGN, Kaizen Game Works (developers of Paradise Killer) has revealed some of the voice cast for Promise Mascot Agency. I hope you’re ready for some recognizable tongues in your ears.\n\n\nMost prominently, the leading dude, Michi, is getting vocalized by Takaya Kuroda, the voice of Kazama Kiryu in the Yakuza/Like a Dragon series. What better person to play a disgraced Yakuza? No one. There is no one better, because he plays the best one. I don’t know how else to describe this, but he has a huggable voice. If you’re not a hugger; a high-fiveable voice.\n\n\nTrailer via IGN\n\n\nThe other revealed cast members are no slouches, either. Pinky (that bizarre severed finger mascot that features so much in the marketing) is voiced by Ayano Shibuya, who was featured in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Princess Peach: Showtime. If you don’t recognize her, it’s probably because you weren’t playing in Japanese. There’s also Eri Saito, who voiced so much in Japanese gaming, but you’d maybe recognize her from Way of the Samurai 3. No? Okay, Chainsaw Man, where she played Aki’s Mother.\n\n\nOn top of the famous vocalists, there are less conventional choices. This includes Swery65, who isn’t really known for voice acting, but did create Deadly Premonition. And then there’s. Wait. Shuhei Yoshida? Haha, really? The former president of Sony Interactive Entertainment.\n\n\nIf you’re not familiar, Promise Mascot Agency is a game about a former Yakuza running an, er, agency for mascots. The big foam costume kind. You have to send them out to various events and help them succeed. You also get to drive around in a Kei truck, which is an important touch.\n\n\nPromise Mascot Agency is set for release on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, and PC sometime this year (2025).\n\nThe post Promise Mascot Agency’s insultingly star-studded voice cast includes Swery65 and the voice of Kazama Kiryu appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Gordon Ramsay is infamous for being the foul-mouthed, though well-meaning restaurateur responsible for Kitchen Nightmares, Hotel Hell, and Hell’s Kitchen. In a move that possibly nobody expected, he’s been temporarily toned down and is guest-starring in mobile farming sim Hay Day. \n\n\nYes, you read that correctly. Fans spotted the interesting development before the official announcement came from Supercell via Facebook, with some taking to Reddit to voice their confusion as to why Greg’s Farm was now “Gordon Ramsay’s Farm” before the new name temporarily disappeared with zero explanation. \n\n\n\n\nIn the early hours of January 15, Supercell revealed that Gordon Ramsay was indeed coming to Hay Day on a temporary basis, filling in for Greg while he’s away on his fishing trip. Gordon will be around until January 24, helping players to look after their farms while bringing a host of time-limited events to complete and rewards to collect.\n\n\nOf course, Supercell couldn’t let this moment slide without mentioning at least one of Gordon’s most infamous moments. At one point during the reveal as part of the latest installment of Dairy News, one presenter can be seen with a slice of bread being held on either side of her face, before she goes on to label herself a “confused sandwich”. This is tamer than the actual Kitchen Nightmares moment they’re paying homage to, when Gordon made a contestant cry while calling them an \"idiot sandwich\". \n\n\n\n\nI can't help but wonder how Gordon Ramsay, of all people, ended up in partnership with Hay Day, but in a separate trailer starring the man himself, he seems to be in search of inner peace, and Hay Day is definitely good for that. Creating your own idyllic farm and forming connections with others, looking after the animals, and making money by selling your produce definitely feels like a calming way of life.\n\nThe post The strangest collab of 2025?

          "description": "Set some time aside in April, because GungHo has announced that the Lunar Remastered Collection will arrive on April 18, 2025 for PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.\n\n\nI feel like we keep getting Lunar re-releases, but I looked it up and the last one was actually in 2010 for the PSP. Or 2012 if you count mobile. Still, it’s seen a lot of second chances for a game that original released on Sega CD back in 1992.\n\n\n\n\nLunar Remastered Collection combines Lunar: The Silver Star and Lunar 2: Eternal Blue, or rather, the PS1 version of those. And while it’s titled “remastered” it largely has the same graphics as those releases with some added effects. It’s still 2D and pixelated, which is fine (or even preferred) by me, but doesn’t feel like it earns the title. Unless you count that gross depth-of-field effect they put on the top and bottom of the screen. I guess the cutscenes seem to be remastered, so it counts. Whatever, I'm not the remaster police.\n\n\nIt looks like you can turn off the gross depth-of-field effects, or, at the very least, play it in classic mode. This might also mean you lose the widescreen mode, but maybe you can tweak things. Either way, you’ll have the same classic games in a new package, so that’s worth a lot.\n\n\nThere will also be a physical version available for $54.99 USD. They will notably feature “reversible covers showcasing two new key arts for LUNAR: Silver Star Story Complete and Lunar 2: Eternal Blue Complete, both illustrated exclusively for the Lunar Remastered Collection by Toshiyuki Kubooka.”\n\n\nLunar Remastered Collection launches on April 18, 2025, for PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.\n\nThe post Lunar Remastered Collection set for release in April appeared first on Destructoid.",

Bundles, floofs, skins, and other cosmetics will appear in the shop.\n\n\nThis event should run until February 15, so there will be plenty of time to get the alerts done and maybe amass enough Platinum to snag some of the limited-time cosmetics.\n\n\nImage via Digital Extremes\n\n\nWhat skins are coming to the event?\n\n\nRight now, it seems that only Mirage will be getting a new themed skin for the event. Frames from previous years who got skins include Saryn, Chroma, and Grendel, which they may return in.\n\n\nWe’ll also see the following items and skins in the three bundles:\n\n\n\nCharming Snake Floof\n\n\nHespar Lunaeus Skin (melee weapon skin)\n\n\nCordmade Sugatra (melee attachment skin)\n\n\nLunar Renewal Snake Flourish\n\n\nLunar Renewal Snake Sigil\n\n\nLunar New Year Renewal Theme\n\n\nMirage Nuwa Floof\n\n\nBoltor Lunaeus Skin\n\n\nMoondance Kavat Armor\n\n\nHeaven Stones Ephemera\n\n\n\nThese will all be sold in three separate bundles, but are likely to be sold individually as well. All bundles coming with these items will also give you some form of in-game currency, mods, or materials. \n\n\nAre there any free items?\n\n\nFor people who want something to grind for, there isn’t much to look forward to other than getting the new Yisi Glyph for your profile icon or the Lunar Renewal Snake Emblem, which will be available via alerts.\n\n\nYou’ll have more than enough time to at least get some items out of this event, but get on it if you don’t want to miss out!\n\nThe post Warframe Lunar New Year event 2025: Start date, skins, and more appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, the big fish in this hugely profitable industry remain unscathed. \nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",

Here’s a shiny new package for you to unwrap, containing the first beta version of the upcoming OpenTTD 15 release. It comes faster, with road waypoints, fewer passwords, better scenario editor, and hopefully with a lot less bugs. To be a bit less vague, here are some of the highlights: Improved picker windows for stations/waypoints/objects/and more. Oh, and that does include road waypoints. Better perfomance in various places, including faster path signals that are now green by default. Password-less network authentication using keys. Several improvements for NewGRFs regarding cargo support. Better scenario editor with a town data importer and manual house placement. A large tree fully hung with ornamental bugfixes. Sadly though, not everbody was good this year. The old NPF pathfinder was finally retired, after YAPF being the superior default for many, many years now. There’s a lot of bugs left for you to find, though, guaranteed. Enjoy the beta, test all the things and report anything you find amiss, to make OpenTTD 15 the best OpenTTD 15 ever.
