One such example came courtesy of publisher THQ to celebrate the Wii release of the long-forgotten Big Family Games (Neighborhood Games). Rather than send just the game itself, THQ commissioned a 24K gold-plated Wii console to be carted off to Buckingham Palace. If nothing else, Lilibet could have sold it on for a few extra quid, but unfortunately, the console never made it to her.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It followed with Nintendo mentioning how pricing of its new releases would be based on a \"case-by-case basis\". Now, the latest game that seems to be generating some discussion about its pricing is Donkey Kong Country Returns HD.\nThe price of this upcoming Switch release has been revealed on Nintendo's official game page, and it's been confirmed it will cost $60 (or the regional equivalent). It's led to some fans questioning Nintendo's \"pricing strategy\" after last year's release Metroid Prime Remastered only cost $40. This news also follows the arrival of Luigi's Mansion 2 HD, which is priced at $60.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Bursting onto the scene in 2014, Yacht Club Games’ slick, throwback platformer caught the imagination of gamers both old and new. Its stunning aesthetic, tight controls, and humorous writing made it a must-play, while its ample secrets, tough but never punishing difficulty, and cheat codes added that crucial replayability factor. The game seemed to hit all the right notes. But that was just the tip of the iceberg. A treasure trove followed – and what a haul it was.\nThree campaigns starring three distinct and equally charming characters from the core cast, as well as a wonderful and woefully overlooked platform fighter. And that’s not even mentioning the amiibo line! If you don’t include Smash Bros. Ultimate fighters, only a handful of other companies' characters have been granted the honour of amiibo representation (Monster Hunter, Dark Souls, and Diablo, if you're wondering), and none that carry the prestige of a gold version. Each character is a thing of beauty in miniature, plastic form. We would’ve bought the whole Order of No Quarter if we could.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It's easy to forget just how far handheld gaming has come in the years since, but seeing one of the greatest platformers of all time come to life on such a humble piece of hardware was truly something else.\nFast-forward to the present day, and one coder by the name of Joshua Barretto is going another step further with a custom rewrite of Super Mario 64 running on the Game Boy Advance. At the time of writing, the project is still ongoing, so there's no doubt much improvement still to be made, but Barretto has managed to implement iconic levels from the game along with traversal moves like the long jump and backflip.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Only the Peregrine Falcon Squad, led by the heroic Marco Rossi, stand in the way of the Rebels establishing their New World Order. This could be the plot of just about any entry in the Metal Slug series, which is at its best when you don’t take it too seriously. Metal Slug Attack Reloaded, a remake of a microtransaction-laden gacha tower-defence mobile game, does its best to uphold the goofy tone of the series while stripping out the worst bits of the 2016 version.\nAt least, it does its best to take the frustrating bits out. The Switch version doesn’t have any microtransactions, thankfully – but it does still very much feel like a gacha game that expects you to log in every day and grind your way to victory. The result is an uneven but still enjoyable game that is constrained by its origins.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

There's no ocean of online interactions, corroding the everyday from all directions, just 1-to-1s through boxy, retro-futurist screens that are so dingy and inadequate it feels like Ripley and Burke are peering at each other through a letterbox.

The downside there, as a few people have pointed out, is that some players don't want to hunt for collectibles before they can topple the bosses.\n Read more",

Apparently some Steam Deck players are seeing an \"Innapropriate activity detected\" message upon launching Elden Ring, blocking them from playing online. I haven't had this myself, and some have reported the issue fixing itself after they installed the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, but hopefully there's a proper patch in the works.\nElden Ring on the Steam Deck has long enjoyed a smoothness that desktop play has lacked. Not so much in simple framerate terms – the handheld spends far more time around the 30fps mark than it does bumping into Elden Ring’s 60fps cap – but thanks to a Proton compatibility update back in 2022, it’s drastically less prone to the flow-breaking stutter that still plagues the RPG in 2024. That now goes for Shadow Of The Erdtree as well, judging from my portable time in the new expansion.\nRead more",

It's also, according to several former employees of Chorus developers Fishlabs in Hamburg, an internal title for the massive cost-cutting project begun by Swedish conglomerate Embracer Group in June 2023.\nThe current incarnation of a bewildering series of mergers, renamings and acquisitions that date back to the founding of Nordic Games in 2004, Embracer have spent much of the past decade buying up video game studios and licenses, from Deus Ex developers Eidos Montreal to the adaptation rights for The Lords Of The Rings. According to a February 2023 earnings report, by the end of December 2022 the conglomerate had 134 internal studios on the books (including table-top developers) and owned or controlled over 850 IPs, with 224 games in development. Our Graham warned of the perils of such consolidation in 2019, and his misgivings have been borne out. Following the reported collapse of a billion dollar Savvy Games investment deal, Embracer set out to recover their debts by cancelling projects, laying off staff and closing whole studios. Fishlabs - acquired by Embracer in 2018 alongside their parent company Koch Media, nowadays Plaion - were among those burned by \"Project Phoenix\", first losing a dozen people in September 2023, and then around half their remaining workforce in November. In the process of these reductions, Embracer also binned off two video game projects – a sumptuous sci-fi metroidvania that was in full development, and a \"visual prototype\" for a brand new Red Faction game.\n  \nRead more",

Early footage painted the portrait of a spirited 3D hack-and-slasher featuring much buckling of swashes, heaving of hos and jollying of rogers.\nJim Rossignol (RPS in peace) was cautiously enthused when he played Captain Blood in 2008. \"It was actually pretty fun - especially the arcade boat violence between speedy galleons - but I'm not exactly holding out for a masterpiece,\" he wrote. Alas, Captain Blood's ship struck a reef in the shape of unspecified publishing disputes, and sank beneath the waves after one last defiant preview showing in 2010. Now, the game has risen from the depths Flying Dutchman-style thanks to new developers Seawolf Studio and General Arcade and publisher SNEG Ltd. It'll finally launch on PC later this year.\n Read more",

It was wonderful, but all these slang terms were being translated in the subtitles for some reason. \"Gobshite\" became \"bastard\". The \"polis\" were localised as the \"police\". And every \"yersel\" sneering out of the machismo-ridden workers became \"yourself\". Well, turns out that's the result of the game defaulting to \"International English\" for its captions. But if you want to immerse yourself in Scottish vernacular as deeply as protagonist Caz McCleary immerses himself in hazardous chemical spills, good news.

Let’s start by addressing that last complaint: the units of Battle Aces have immense personality. It just doesn’t come across well in screens.\nEach is a mix of bug and robot, with a clutch of finely observed, quirky-but-never-gratuitous animations that immediately had me choosing favourites when I played the game at Summer Game Fest. \"Our main unit design concept artist, his father was also an illustrator and nature illustrator at that, so he's already accomplished with animal designs, but he also loves mechs and robots too,\" notes Uncapped Games art director Ted Park. \"So he's kind of melded both worlds as much as he can.\"\r\n \nRead more",

The Land Of Shadow may not be as expansive as the base game's Lands Between, but it's knottier, denser, more of a twisting mass that burrows into the earth and soars into the skies. For this reason I think it produces some of Elden Ring's finest moments, as exploration leads to a truer sense of discovery reminiscent of old Souls. But I also think its sheer density exposes more chinks in its open world format, where its interconnected sprawl leads to even greater recollection paralysis.\nRead more",

I'd save up to buy one of the premium headliners, attempt to get my money's worth inside a week, then swap it for a respected double-A and perhaps a sub-£8 oddity with the manual missing - nesting one purchase within the other like a series of Matryoshka dolls.\nThis was my Big Short, my Moneyball. But it had a drawback: often, I was so eager to leapfrog to another game before the trade-in price changed that I skimmed RPGs that are now considered classics. The big one was Suikoden 2, which I spent only an evening with before gambling that I'd eke more FunValue out of a game with a less traditional battle system. I can't remember what I traded that for, which says it all. Another was Baten Kaitos on Gamecube, which - yes, we are finally getting to the point here - has just been rereleased on Steam in the shape of a Baten Kaitos I & II HD Remaster. I can't remember what I traded Baten Kaitos for either, which again, says it all. Please, gentle reader - be better.\r\n \nRead more",

This morning, it emerged that Paradox Tectonic, the studio working on the game, have been shuttered, via GameWatcher.\n \nRead more",

I'm not entirely convinced it has longevity beyond its impeccably scorched and dented PS1 vibes, but I definitely think you should try the demo, now that the early access version is out.\n Read more",

From the opening moments of Still Wakes The Deep you know life on its 1970s North Sea oil rig is precarious. Leaky ceilings, busted panelling, faulty drill machinery - the omens pile up as you spend your first thirty minutes wandering through the colleague-packed canteen and over the platform into the boss' office for a severe dressing-down. It's a classic pre-disaster setup for a mostly traditional monster story, yet the game sticks expertly to the first-person horror form, and its voice actors' performances are so spot-on, that it'd feel churlish to judge this foaming fear simulator for sticking to type. It also has some markedly unsettling use of the shipping forecast, a famously dull feature of British radio I definitely did not expect to freak me out in a video game.\nRead more",

Here to put such kitchen wisdom to the test is BioWare's Dragon Age: The Veilguard, which \"only\" allows you to bring two companions into the fray, one fewer than 2014's Dragon Age: Inquisition. It's another indication that this will be more biffy action game than thinky party-based RPG. The upside, assuming you find that last sentence disappointing, is that exploration and combat will be more \"intimate\", and individual characters will have more screentime to bounce off each other and flourish as personalities. All this comes care of a BioWare Discord Q&A from late last week, which you can watch in full below.\n Read more",

          "description": "Yesterday, out of nowhere, Capcom casually announced it was remastering the original Dead Rising. While certainly exciting, it did confuse me why Capcom decided to drop this via a random Tweet instead of teasing it during Summer Game Fest. Turns out it was because it's saving the details for its own Capcom Next showcase.\n\n\nYou won't have to wait long for it either since the showcase is scheduled to take place in less than a week on Monday, July 1. It will air at 3 p.m. PT / 6 p.m. ET / 11 p.m. BST via Capcom's official YouTube channel. Don't go in expecting a surplus of brand-new reveals, though, as Capcom has said it'll only run for 25 minutes and be focusing on just three titles.\n\n\n\n\nDead Rising Deluxe Remaster is obviously the main highlight. The teaser trailer offered a brief glimpse at the overhauled graphics and Frank West's updated design, but Capcom Next should provide some actual gameplay and hopefully a release window. A 2024 launch would be a nice surprise, though I could see it being saved for 2025 instead.\n\n\nCapcom will also have updates on Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess, its Japanese folklore themed action-strategy game. It's set to launch in a few weeks on July 19, so it makes sense for Capcom to give this some focus. I'm definitely curious to see how this will end up performing since it's a new IP from the company.\n\n\nThe only other game to get any attention will be Resident Evil 7, which is coming to iPhone, iPad, and Mac the day after the showcase on July 2. Ideally, Capcom won't dedicate too much time to this one since it's a port of a seven-year old game. I doubt anyone will be tuning in specifically for news on this over the Dead Rising remaster, especially considering the recent report on how other Resident Evil mobile ports are performing (spoilers: they're doing badly).\n\nThe post First Dead Rising remaster details and more coming in Capcom summer showcase appeared first on Destructoid.",

Now, you can deliver it to characters like Mushu and the Beast, use it as a favorite gift, or eat it for some extra energy.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nYou'll initially unlock the wonton soup recipe after progressing through Mushu's level four friendship quest. However, you can make it before this point if you have the ingredients for it. If you don't have the recipe yet, Mushu will give you a book that teaches you how to make it and automatically fills your collection log with the recipe. \n\n\nAll Wonton Soup ingredients\n\n\nSome wonton soup ingredients are easier to obtain than others. While wheat is obtainable after unlocking Peaceful Meadows, onions require entering the Forest of Valor. Below is the list of every item and their locations:\n\n\n\nEggs: Chez Remy shop\n\n\nWheat: Peaceful Meadows\n\n\nShrimp: Dazzle Beach (fishing)\n\n\nOnion: Forest of Valor\n\n\n\nThe most challenging item of these four is onions, which take one hour and 15 minutes to grow. Alternatively, if you have WALL-E's garden, you can find onions and wheat among the possible produce options.

Before you can make the mannequin, though, you'll need some of the Beast's old clothes.\n\n\nBeast's old clothes location in Disney Dreamlight Valley\n\n\nThe Beast's old clothes are in his bedroom behind a divider near the bathtub.

Take these clothes from the storage UI to progress through the Mushu Program quest.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nIf you're unsure how to get to the Beast's old bedroom, walk forward from the Beauty and the Beast Realm's starting location.

          "description": "As Destiny 2 progresses through its various plotlines and pieces of content, some cosmetics become unavailable as new ones enter the fray. This is standard and is especially prominent with all the legacy Titles that are now unobtainable. One such cosmetic is an emblem that some people want due to its clean look and the pretty red it evokes. Here's whether you can still get the Slaycation emblem in Destiny 2.\n\n\nIs the Slaycation emblem still available in Destiny 2?\n\n\nAs of writing, the Slaycation emblem can not be earned. The emblem was previously available before the launch of The Final Shape, given upon completing the New Territory PvP activity. The emblem is unobtainable now that The Final Shape is out, and the New Territory mode is not part of The Crucible.\n\n\nAs for whether the emblem will return in the future, it is currently unclear though ultimately unlikely. Bungie has neither confirmed nor denied that the Slaycation emblem will return in the future. However, they tend not to bring emblems back that were available in the past barring a few exceptions (like reprised raids from Destiny 1 and their emblems).\n\n\nOn the bright side, there are a lot of emblems in Destiny 2 that are similar. The Classy Order emblem for example is quite similar to Slaycation and can be earned by heading to the Bungie Rewards site and putting in the code YRC-C3D-YNC. This should gift you the emblem, but you may need to check with your Postmaster if your emblem inventory is full.\n\nThe post Can you still get the Slaycation emblem in Destiny 2? appeared first on Destructoid.",

Long gone are the days of Bungie giving players all subclass aspects out of the gate. Now, we need to track down each one across The Pale Heart of the Traveler. Here's where to find Memory: Divise Darkness and how to complete it.\n\n\nThe real treasure was the mountain we had to climb along the way\n\n\nThe first step is to acquire Memory: Darkness Divisive, which is done by collecting five Memory: Vestige Darkness. These are obtained by completing the mini-events associated with the overgrown chests that glow orange. These range from collecting Darkness Columns to rolling a Darkness tumbleweed into a pit.\n\n\nOnce you have five, they'll automatically be converted into Memory: Divisive Darkness. This will then place a search area indicator on your map at the top of the mountain in The Divide. Put on some comfy boots and your favorite murder-mystery podcast, because we've got quite the hike ahead of us.\n\n\nImage by Destructoid\n\n\nSpawn in The Blooming and head southeast to The Seclusion. Follow the path through Zavala's hall of tortured memories until you come to the replica of his shack. Keep going straight to the cave in the opposite corner of the area. Continue through the caverns of upside-down trees and waterfalls until you reach the frozen waters of The Divide.\n\n\nTrek up the frozen escarpment until you reach the area that looks like the entrance to Shadow Moses Island. Look over the ledge on the cliffside and down to spot the chest resting on the walkway below.\n\n\nImage by Destructoid\n\n\nThe chest contains the Facet of Honor Prismatic Fragment. When equipped as part of the Prismatic subclass kit, you'll gain +10 Strength and Transcendance energy matching the elemental pickup.

The Entity, when Bungie first revealed the villain that would lead the charge in The Final Shape. The weird space unibrow plus the cloud of heads hovering over their own head just seemed too goofy and impractical for an enemy that wanted to seem menacing, for players who'd already been up against half the galaxy. I was very wrong.\n\n\n\n\nThe video above shows both the final work and the making of the promotional video showcase. And sure, there are some effects done in post to add the background with the flying pyramids, VFX to make The Witness' weird movements come to live, and even some CG to bring The Witness' cloud of smoke look more realistic. Still, there are a lot of practical effects, high-tech animatronics, and even practical smoke involved. The whole thing works very well even without all the CGI smoke-and-mirrors. The make-up, the shiny Grey Alien-looking eyes, the costume design and fabric all look spectacular.\n\n\nThere's no better way to prove that a character could actually kick ass in real life than having a cosplayer actually embodying it, and Cinderys pulled it off perfectly. From now on, I'll refrain from writing off any idea of a cosplay as \"impossible.\"\n\n\nYou can now face off against the real video game Witness on Destiny 2: The Final Shape on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.\n\n\n\n\nThe post Destiny 2 fan shows off incredible Witness cosplay appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "God rolls are the bread and butter of Destiny 2's late game, especially if you're a PvP player. The late game of any MMO like Destiny involves much min-maxing your build, so changing every stat you can along with perks can make a huge difference. One such weapon is quite new but can be farmed as part of a common activity. Here's the god roll for the Scintillation Linear Fusion Rifle in Destiny 2.\n\n\nThe best perks and attachments for the Scintillation linear fusion rifle in Destiny 2\n\n\nImage via Destructoid.\n\n\nScintillation is part of a group of weapons from the Nightfall activity that receive the Origin Trait Veist Stinger. This trait gives shots a 10% chance to activate the Veist Stinger buff for seven seconds, which refills the magazine by 25% from reserves and decreases the movement speed penalty from aiming down sights by 10%. It isn't a huge buff, but it can help you keep sustained DPS a bit longer. The perks and attachments we're choosing here help to further that goal:\n\n\n\nBarrel: Corkscrew Rifling\n\n\nBattery: Enhanced Battery\n\n\nPerk 1: Envious Assassin\n\n\nPerk 2: Bait and Switch\n\n\n\nCorkscrew Rifling immediately improves range, stability, and handling speed, letting you stay on target much easier. Meanwhile, Enhanced Battery provides an extra shot to increase the returns to the magazine. Envious Assassin also returns shots to the magazine, provided you're killing enemies with your other weapons beforehand. Bait and Switch also buffs you based on your kills with other weapons, but instead improves damage. In essence, you want to get kills with your two other weapons, then swap to Scintillation to do major boss damage.

However, unlocking their ingredients requires building Mulan's tea stall, which you can do shortly after inviting her to your village.\n\n\nHow to make tea in Disney Dreamlight Valley\n\n\nYou'll build Mulan's tea stall and unlock tea-making after advancing through her level two Friendship quest, Daily Regime. During this mission, you'll cook vegetarian pizzas for her before venturing out to mine gems. As a reward for completing these objectives, Mulan will introduce tea to Dreamlight Valley, allowing you to build her tea stall and purchase ingredients for these drinks.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nHowever, you'll have to invite Mulan to Dreamlight Valley before you build her tea stall. You unlock her and Mushu as characters by traveling to Mulan's Realm and helping them improve the area's defences. From here, you can befriend them, leading into Mulan's Daily Regime quest at level two.\n\n\nAfter beginning Daily Regime, you'll have the following objectives to complete:\n\n\n\nCook some Vegetarian pizza.\n\n\nFollow Mulan's training routine by mining topaz, aquamarine, garnet, and peridot.\n\n\nEnter the Mulan Realm to search for tea crates.\n\n\n\nMost of these are straightforward, as Mulan will give you the recipe for the pizza and tea throughout the quest. Mining each mineral is more time-consuming than anything, while the tea crates are within the base camp where you created Mushu's dragon statues.\n\n\nOnce you complete each task and place down the tea stall, you can buy Oolong, Jasmine, and Chrysanthemum tea leaves. Use these with their other ingredients to make the tea, allowing you to progress through the Daily Regime quest and officially unlock all three tea recipes.\n\nThe post How to unlock Mulan’s tea stall in Disney Dreamlight Valley appeared first on Destructoid.",

Though the once previously Xbox-exclusive game has since made its way to PlayStation and PC platforms, it remains unclear which platforms this remaster is coming to. And there's no word on when to expect the remaster either. \nRevealed with a short 47-second teaser trailer, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster looks great, almost more like a remake than a remaster. It's unclear if this is a remaster of the original 2006 game or the HD version of Dead Rising that launched on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC back in 2017. Regardless, we're stoked to head back into a zombie-infested mall with journalist Frank West whenever this remaster launches. \nCheck out the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster teaser trailer for yourself below: \n\n\n\nAre you excited for Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster?

Now, just a few days later, developer From Software has released a new patch for the game that should make Shadow of the Erdtree a bit easier. \nNow live, Calibration Update 1.12.2 targets the scaling of the attack and damage negation given to players with each Shadow Realm Blessing upgrade. Here's what's changed: \nThe attack and damage negation has been increased for the first half of the maximum amount of Blessing enhancements, and the second half will now be more gradual. \nThe attack and damage negation granted by the final level of Blessing enhancements has been slightly increased. \n\n\nThis patch should apply automatically like any other Elden Ring update but if it doesn't – the Calibration Version listed at the bottom right reads \"1.12.2\" if it has – select \"LOGIN\" and that will apply the latest version of the game. \nThe only other thing this update contains is word from From Software on a confirmed bug where the raytracing settings of Shadow of the Erdtree are automatically enabled (if you've previously loaded save data from previous game versions), which is causing framerate issues for some players. If you're encountering said issues, check to see if you have raytracing on or off in the game's system graphical settings. \nThis patch arrives after one that hit the game last week, which added new hairtsyles, inventory features, balance adjustments, and more to Elden Ring ahead of Shadow of the Erdtree's launch. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree review, and then check out this interview where From Software's Hidetaka Miyazaki discusses his approach to difficulty in games. \nWhat do you think of this update?

A new trailer features a chat with the game's original creative director Warren Spector, who is also involved with this remake, to reveal Rebrushed's Collector's Edition.\nFor $199.99, this special box is available for pre-order now and includes the following items:\nThe full game Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed\nA 28 cm Mickey Mouse statue\nAn Oswald the Lucky Rabbit keychain\nA vintage Mickey Mouse tin sign\nSix Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed postcards\nA Collector’s Steelbook\nThe Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed costume pack\n\n\nIf you missed the original game, it sees Mickey explore a fantasy world called the Wasteland filled with obscure Disney characters, namely antagonist Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, Disney's original animation star who predates Mickey Mouse. The Wasteland has been taken over by an entity called the Blot, which Mickey accidentally unleashed and must now stop. The 3D action platformer sees Mickey wielding a magic paintbrush that can create new objects while erasing others, and Mickey's actions shape his destiny and the game's story. \nDisney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.

To access it, go to \"Settings\" on your PS4 version of Minecraft while playing on a PS5 and select \"Preview.\" This preview includes the new Tricky Trials update, so you can venture into the trial chambers, meet a breeze, craft a mace, and more. \nMojang asks that players who encounter bugs during this preview report it to the developer, and more generally, provide any feedback they might have. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Minecraft review, and then check out this story about how actor Jack Black has all but confirmed he's playing Steve in the upcoming live-action Minecraft movie.

With Rod Humble, a lead designer on The Sims 2 and The Sims 3, leading Tectonic, fans were hopeful about Life By You, which was set to launch into Early Access earlier this month before an indefinite delay.\nThat Early Access launch never happened as Life By You was subsequently canceled, and now, in the same week, Paradox Interactive has announced it is closing Tectonic, as reported by Game Developer. \n\"This is difficult and drastic news for our colleagues at Tectonic, who've worked hard on Life By You's Early Access release,\" Paradox Interactive CEO Fredrik Wester writes in a press release. \"Sadly, with the cancelation of their sole proje…",

In the past, Sonic Team creative officer Takashi Iizuka told me Shadow is his favorite character in the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise outside of Sonic. It makes sense; after all, as the director of Sonic Adventure 2, where Shadow made his debut, Iizuka was instrumental in creating the dark hedgehog. \n\"Even now, if you ask me who my favorite character is, Shadow is going to pop up there,\" Iizuka says. \"Even when we think about the foundation of the entire franchise, Sonic and Shadow are really holding up so much of the franchise.

Though other characters appeared in Sonic Generations, Sonic – in both his Classic and Modern forms – was the sole playable character. Now, 13 years later, the well-liked celebratory release returns as the latest Sonic remaster, but it's not simply the same package with performance enhancements. Sure, those are there, but perhaps the biggest selling point is the inclusion of Shadow the Hedgehog as a playable character. \nBut Shadow is much more than a reskin of Sonic. Yes, the base of Shadow in his Sonic Adventure 2 debut was that he could match Sonic's abilities, but we've seen him appear in a variety of gameplay styles, with varying powers at his di…",

From Dragon Age: Origins' real-time strategy RPG approach to Dragon Age II's mostly-set-within-one-city action experience to Dragon Age: Inquisition's strategy-action mix, BioWare hasn't quite defined the franchise's combat. However, a through-line is apparent from Origins to Inquisition: BioWare seemingly wants this franchise to be action but has attempted to shift to that without abandoning its longtime fans. \nWith Dragon Age: The Veilguard, BioWare has completed its transition from strategy to real-time action, but thanks to an optional tactical pause-and-play combat wheel that harkens back to the series' origins, I feel it's found a great (battle)ground …",

But something about that game has stuck with players. In addition to resonating with a wider audience than many of From Software's most iconic titles to that point, Bloodborne delivered an engrossing world full of mystery and challenge, causing it to remain top-of-mind for many Soulslike fans even today. In the lead-up to the launch of Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree, I sat down with the creator of Elden Ring, Dark Souls, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, Demon's Souls, and Bloodborne to learn why the 2015 PS4 exclusive holds as special a place in his heart as it does the game's many fans.\nFor Miyaz…",

          "description": "Hot off the Boston Celtics' NBA Finals victory last night, we learned of a new way we can step onto the court this summer. Nintendo Switch Sports, the successor to the overwhelmingly popular Wii Sports series, arrived in 2022. While the initial offerings lacked depth and sometimes left us craving more than the base game was able to deliver, Nintendo has stuck with the title and has improved the offerings through free updates. A few months after launch, the title added golf at no additional charge, and during today's Nintendo Direct, we learned that another free update is coming to the game this summer to add basketball to the mix.\nNintendo Switch Sports' implementation of basketball uses motion controls to dribble, pass, and shoot. You can participate in two-on-two matches locally, or compete in Five-Streak Battle matches and Three-Point Contests. You can also take part in a solo Three-Point Challenge, where you need to make as many baskets as you can before time expires.\nNintendo Switch Sports' basketball free update arrives this summer.

          "description": "We recently learned about five Mega Man games arriving on Nintendo Switch Online's Game Boy catalog, but Nintendo has recently focused an increasing amount of its catalog efforts on more obscure titles or those that never came to the West. With many of the most classic titles already on Nintendo Switch Online's various catalogs, the output has decreased significantly. However, during today's Nintendo Direct, four of the most requested games were announced for release today.\nMetroid: Zero Mission, the excellent Game Boy Advance remake of the original Metroid, and The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Four Swords, the Game Boy Advance remake of the classic SNES title but with a separate co-op campaign, come to Nintendo Switch Online's Game Boy Advance catalog. On top of that, Nintendo announced the Nintendo 64 catalog is getting two M-rated entries: Perfect Dark, the GoldenEye 007 spiritual successor from developer Rare, and Turok: Dinosaur Hunter.\nAs a reminder, the NES, SNES, and Game Boy libraries are included in the base Nintendo Switch Online subscription, while Nintendo 64, Game Boy Advance, and Sega Genesis catalogs require you to upgrade to the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription. As such, to access all of the games announced and released today, you'll need to subscribe to that premium membership. The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Four Swords and Metroid: Zero Mission join the Game Boy Advance library today, while Perfect Dark and Turok: Dinosaur Hunter join the Nintendo 64 catalog today.",

          "description": "In recent years, Capcom has really shown its dedication to the Ace Attorney series by bringing the games to modern consoles. The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles brought two games to the West for the first time, while the Apollo Justice Ace Attorney Trilogy gave the newest games in the series a facelift. Today, with the announcement of Ace Attorney Investigations Collection, Capcom is not just bringing another Japan-only release to Western gamers, but it's also made the entire library of Ace Attorney games available on modern consoles.\n\n\nThe Investigations games follow Miles Edgeworth, an antagonist turned reluctant ally from the original trilogy of Phoenix Wright games. Instead of defending suspects in court, Edgeworth is a prosecutor, so it's up to him to build a case against the main suspects. By collecting evidence and completing logic puzzles, he and the lovable Detective Gumshoe solve mysteries and serve justice. While the first game launched in the States as a DS title, the second never officially made it over, so this is many players' first chance to see its story.\nLike other Ace Attorney collections, the Ace Attorney Investigations Collection will have a number of modes and settings for fans to appreciate the art and music of the original game. While it includes new \"hand-drawn character visuals\" for a more modern look, it also allows players to switch to classic pixel sprites if they prefer the look of the original. Meanwhile, the gallery includes character art, a photo album, and music from the game, including orchestral arrangements.\nWhile the announcement was made during the Nintendo Direct, Ace Attorney Investigations collection is far from a console exclusive – the two-game collection will launch on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on September 6.",

Super Mario Party Jamboree is a brand-new entry in the franchise, but it’s looking as if the general thrust of play remains mostly intact, with a few notable additions.\nThe reveal trailer shows Mario and friends descending on a small archipelago of islands that make up a massive resort. Across the many boards, players can encounter 110 different minigames.\nJamboree includes five new boards – Mega Wiggler’s Tree Party, King Bowser’s Keep, Roll ‘em Raceway, Goomba Lagoon, and Rainbow Galleria – plus returning boards from earlier games, including Mario’s Rainbow Castle (From Mario Party) and Western Land (from Mario Party 2). We got to see a bit of how the board games play out in a couple of these locales. Roll ‘em Raceway includes a turbo dice item that allows player Karts to zip forward up to 40 spaces with a good roll. In Goomba Lagoon, a changing tide adjusts the path across the board.\nThe most surprising addition is the new Koopathlon game mode, which allows up to 20 players to jump in together online. The early gameplay on offer here calls to mind other online party titles like Fall Guys.\nNintendo is touting Jamboree as the largest game in the series. We’ll see how true that is when the game launches for Switch on October 17.",

In today's Nintendo Direct, that wish was finally granted; in The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, it's up to Princess Zelda to save Hyrule when Link is captured.\n\n\nWhile the game takes its art style from 2019's Link's Awakening remake, this title is not a remake of any kind, and there's no clear indication that it is connected to Link's Awakening.

          "description": "We finally have a look at Metroid Prime 4 outside of just a logo. The game is releasing in 2025 and is officially titled Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. The game has had its various tribulations since its announcement in 2017. It was originally being developed by Bandai Namco, but was later restarted and moved over to Retro Studios, the developer behind the the first three Metroid Prime games.\n\n\nFinally seeing the game is action is exciting, but in a way, not surprising. The action is reminiscent of Retro's other Metroid games (which is a good thing). We see Samus land on a planet clearly in the middle of a battle in a new ship, she moves around, scans elements of the environment, attacks monsters, and turns into a Morph Ball. We all see a tease of a new enemy who has a pair of Metroids floating over their shoulder.\nFor our review of the recent Metroid Prime remaster, head here.",

The title arrived as an Apple Arcade exclusive in 2021 and currently holds an 80 out of 100 on reviews aggregate site Metacritic. It also won the award for Mobile game of the Year at the 25th Annual DICE Awards. \nMistwalker was founded in 2004 by Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi, who produced Fantasian. The studio frequently collaborates with longtime Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu, who also worked on Fantasian as the composer. To date, Mistwalker has released multiple critically acclaimed games, including Blue Dragon, Lost Odyssey, and The Last Story.\nFantasian uses similar turn-based design conventions as were found in many of the most classic Final Fantasy games. The title also implements several quality-of-life modernizations, such as the ability to skip random encounters with enemy types you've already defeated until they choose to fight them all at once. Despite being a mobile title, Fantasian's ties to Apple Arcade means it does not include any microtransactions or paid DLC.\nFantasian Neo Dimension arrives on Nintendo Switch this holiday season.",

          "description": "Yars Rising is the successor of the 1982 Atari classic Yars' Revenge. However, on the surface, it has little to do with the original game created by Howard Scott Warshaw. After all, one is a 2D space shooter while another is a modernized sci-fi Metroidvania. However, with homages to Atari and gaming's past galore, all developed by a renowned studio like WayForward, this release could be one to look forward to when it arrives on its newly announced September release date.\nTaking control of a hacker named Emi (codename Yar), players must blast, hack, and sneak their way through various areas. As she progresses, she unlocks new powers that allow her to take out enemies more easily and, in true Metroidvania fashion, access new areas. Yars Rising is published by Atari and pays homage to the company's past, including bosses and minigames that borrow gameplay elements from classic Atari titles.\nThough the game is coming to a broader array of platforms, PlayStation 5 and Switch players can pick up physical editions of the game. We recently had a chance to go hands-on with Yars Rising and included our impressions in our list of the coolest things we saw at Summer Game Fest. To read that entry and see the rest of the list, head here. Yars Rising arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on September 10.",

This means that players will have the opportunity to drive around Mexico in a 2024 Ford Mustang Dark Horse, 2023 Hyundai IONIQ 5 N, 2021 Toyta GR Yaris, 2023 Porsche Taycan Cross Turismo Turbo S, and 2023 Kia EV6 GT. However, for many, those are unlikely to be the highlight of this batch of releases. Available tomorrow, Forza Horizon 5 is bringing several iconic vehicles from Universal Studios films and TV shows.\nThe Universal Icons Car Pack adds KITT from Knight Rider, Jurassic Park's 1992 Jeep Wrangler Sahara, and a distinct version of the Delorean Time Machine from each Back to the Future film in the trilogy. Each Time Machine features a unique look and visual effects once you hit 88 miles per hour. The Jurassic Park Wrangler features the park's logo as well as the iconic color scheme from the film. Finally, KITT includes a body kit that includes Super Pursuit Mode.\nThis isn't the first time Forza Horizon 5 has introduced licensed vehicles from pop-culture properties. Players can already purchase the Forza Horizon 5: Fast X Car Pack as well as the Forza Horizon 5: Hot Wheels expansion. In addition to those aforementioned vehicles, this season adds 17 EventLab props to help players build modern highways and a robot collectible out in the world.\nWe absolutely loved Forza Horizon 5 when it came out in 2021, awarding it a 9.5 out of 10, naming it one of the top 10 games of 2021, and awarding it both Best Microsoft Exclusive and Best Racing Game for that year. The Universal Icons Car Pack will be available tomorrow, June 18. The Mustang arrives on June 20, the IONIQ and EV6 land in-game on June 27. The Yaris comes out on July 4 and the Taycan on July 11.",

No, it’s not the key on your keyboard. Rather, it’s a detective story set on a distant planet. Important data has been stolen, and the perpetrator is a shape-shifter laying low in a spaceport dive bar until he can flee off-planet. You play a hard-boiled detective who has the skill to psychically visit bar patrons’ memories to gather clues and narrow down suspects.\nThis is thanks to the kind people at ZOOM Platform, who provided us with the original game sources to work with. Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game features a lot of options to chat around with bar patrons’ and do various actions in the different flashbacks. So we really need people to spend time experimenting and make sure everything works correctly. And please take some screenshots along the way.\nIf you don’t own The Space Bar, you can try one of the free demos or purchase it digitally from the ZOOM Platform. Testing is also available on Steam via a beta branch, check the Steam announcement for more details.\nNow, good luck, and fingers crossed you can find the perp. Otherwise, your bureau chief will have you getting up close and personal with toilet duties for the rest of your career. Oh, and PS: The viewpoints of different aliens differ. For the Bartender, who has segmented eyes, even the original developers felt it was difficult and left in a cheat key of ScrollLock to switch back to a single viewpoint. Feel free to use it if, at any point, the flashback becomes too much for you :)\n>",
