Perhaps it’s a jaunty farm sim like Stardew Valley or Story of Seasons, a laid-back puzzler like Unpacking, or even a cute adventure like A Short Hike. The point is that many of us have preconceived notions of what a relaxing game should look like, but if Ryan Janes’ ‘The Most Relaxing Video Games’ book is anything to go by, then blissful relaxation can potentially be found in the most unlikely genres imaginable.\nPublished by White Owl, an imprint of Pen & Sword Books (which has also published books from the likes of Kirk McKeand and Chris Scullion), ‘The Most Relaxing Video Games’ immediately struck us as being geared toward those who perhaps don’t consider gaming to be their primary hobby. Indeed, for those of us at Nintendo Life, our first glimpse of the book consisted of casually flicking through the pages while muttering “Yep… Yep…” under our breath as we cross checked each entry with our own internally curated list.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Josh is doggedly pursuing something he’s called “The Cure” which he believes will save his family, though all his family sees is a man increasingly consumed and isolated by his ‘research’. The thing is, Josh has seemingly discovered the multiverse and a way of jumping into neighboring realities. This has left his mind profoundly broken, unable to easily discern between memory and reality after crossing dimensions. So, you set out to put together all the pieces and try to make sense not just of where Josh has come from, but where he may go if this cure he’s been after isn’t so fictional after all.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

I caught the first couple of episodes last week, and while I find the show's aesthetics off-putting - it's kind of a Fallout themepark, rather than a convincing world - I do think there's the makings of a fun tale here.\nRead more",

It's 2D, side on platforming, and super colourful. Think Dead Cells skinned as a kids cartoon with a branded cereal tie-in, extremely cool music, and an emphasis on wall running.

Rather than simply building on the previous game's premise of a Hamlet's worth of upgradeable, derangeable heroes venturing into tabletop RPG-style labyrinths, it stripped away Darkest Dungeon's skin and moved its bones and organs around to create a gruelling roguelike. Well, developers Red Hook appear to have done it again with Darkest Dungeon 2's free Kingdoms mode, out later this year, which slices open Darkest Dungeon 2's hide and recomposes it into a turn-based strategy boardgame, where you defend a world map against encroaching eldritch creatures.\nRead more",

It's called Operation Guns. Get on board. Trailed with, as is now traditional, a cool animated trailer that suggests the game is a Saturday morning cartoon and not a top down pixelated nightmare that will flush out any latent photosensitivity lurking in your skull (complimentary), Operation Guns is arriving on May 9th, so about a month away.\nRead more",

What makes a “triple-I” game a “triple-I” game, as opposed to (hawk, spit) a regular indie? I've given it some thought, and I think the answer is: \"has more money and status than most indies, but not, like, Call of Duty levels, and also one of our partners is Gearbox Publishing, so this is perhaps ‘indie’ in the Geoff Keighley sense.\"\nDon’t expect any of Keighley's beloved Kojima interludes or dance numbers in this one, however. The IIIIs are a leaner, quieter showcase with no host or advertising or celebrity drop-ins – you can read more about the thinking behind the event in my GDC interview with a few of the participating studios.

          "description": "Drop Bear Bytes, the studio behind post-apocalyptic RPG Broken Roads, are named after Australia’s deadliest creature. The Drop Bear might look like a normal koala, but they’re actually dangerous predators, fond of jumping from trees to maul unsuspecting chumps who forget to take adequate precautions, like urinating on themselves. Really, the story is a wind-up the aussies like to blag tourists with. If it looks like a koala, it’s just a koala. But it’s this sort of character, inspired by love for Australia’s unique landscape, culture and good-natured mick-taking, that forms the heart of the best bits in Broken Roads. I say ‘best bits’, but I should probably say ‘the only bits that I actually enjoyed’, unfortunately.\nBombs wiped out 80% of Australia’s population, and left the remaining nail-hard Nancys and tough Tobiases to fend for themselves in a world short of resources, but shockingly plentiful in both guns and pre-made Vegemite sarnies. You’ll pick one of four character classes - I went with ‘Jackaroo’ (cattle hand), because it was called ‘Jackaroo’ - before tackling a short tutorial section. You'll then be thrust into some events, where you’ll meet the rest of your starting party and kick off the game proper.\n \nRead more",

Now the sequel, Sucker For Love: Date To Die For has revealed a release date of April 23rd, and seems to be leaning into horror even more, while also still being a dating sim featuring an eldritch goat god with massive cans. Yet the presser also says \"no scares this time\". I am confused, which is why it's probably good there's a demo on Steam to sort of give you a taster.\nRead more",

          "description": "When Bethesda was working out how to turn their popular Elder Scrolls RPGs into an online behemoth to rival World Of Warcraft back in the late 00s, the initial pitch was \"Elder Scrolls with friends,\" creative director Rich Lambert tells me. A simple idea on paper, perhaps, but one that proved to be a lot more complicated in the realisation of it. Zenimax Online Studios was founded in 2007, a year after The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion landed to universal critical praise, but it wasn't until seven years later that The Elder Scrolls Online finally released for PC in 2014. At launch \"we were walking this weird line between 'online game' and 'Elder Scrolls game',\" Lambert says. \"We didn't do either of them particularly well.\"\nTen years later, though, The Elder Scrolls Online is thriving. At last count, the game has over 24 million players galloping about the plains of Tamriel, and later this June, it will receive its eighth major Chapter expansion, Gold Road, which adds Oblivion's West Weald to the game and wraps up the mystery of the new Daedric Prince that arrived at the end of the previous expansion, Necrom. But the path ESO has taken to get here hasn't been nearly as glittering, with its PC launch in particular generating \"a lot of feedback\", as studio director Matt Firor told press at the game's tenth anniversary event last week. In fact, it wasn't until ESO came to consoles in 2015 that the game really found its voice, says Lambert. \"We had to really figure out what we wanted to be, and we chose 'Elder Scrolls'. As soon as we hit that core pillar of 'It's Elder Scrolls first, online second,' then it really just helped inform everything we've done since.\" Trouble is, when the thrust of ESO's development straddled the launch of two very different Elder Scrolls games, even nailing down that first part of the pillar proved to be more challenging than expected.\nRead more",

          "description": "Botany Manor is a game that seems calculated to make me sit up on alert like a meerkat, or crash through a wall yelling like that sentient jug mascot (I am not from America, I just know he exists). It's a puzzle game about growing plants. Holy Strange Horticulture, Batman! But Botany Manor is much less eldritch, and much more gentle historical feel-good movie starring Emma Thompson in the lead role. That role - which in this case is played by you in first person rather than La Thompson - is of Arabella Greene, a retired botanist who, thank God, is the childless inheritor of a huge manor and ancestral wealth, and so is able to spend the sunny days of 1890 pottering around the house and grounds researching weird, slightly fantastical plants almost wholly untroubled. So in this respect it is also a fantasy game. It's quite delightful, which is the sort of phrase I am confident Arabella would use.\nRead more",

An aquarist is someone who builds and manages aquariums, which is your principle task in the capital A Aquarist game. It recently left early access, which is sort of unbelievable because it's very janky in the most adorable way. You can tell it was made by someone who bloody loves aquariums, but taken at face value the career mode tells a strange tale indeed. For example, you have a very unsettling father.\nRead more",

          "description": "According to one unofficial tracker created by video game artist Farhan Noor, there have been 8000 layoffs in 2024 so far, following an estimated 10,500 layoffs in 2023. The leaders of Microsoft, Embracer Group, Epic and other industry giants have made swingeing cuts to their workforces. While larger companies have inevitably seen the largest reductions, many smaller developers and publishers have also cut staff or even closed their doors. Circumstances vary by company, of course, but as regards the biggest publishers, there are some broad overlapping causes: reckless or, if you prefer, \"overambitious\" expansion and overhiring during the pandemic lockdown gaming boom; lower-than-hoped returns on new technologies and business models such as NFTs; and rising global interest rates, which have scared away potential investors.\nThe carnage was uppermost in Larian CEO's Swen Vincke's mind when he accepted Baldur's Gate 3's Best Narrative gong at the GDC Awards last month. According to Vincke, the layoffs can be traced straightforwardly to a pattern of executive greed that sees company leadership betting the livelihoods and stability of their workers on whatever new idea seems capable of delivering instant growth for shareholders.\n Read more",

But lurking behind that all-too-innocent story mode there is a Biblical terror in the shape of a 50-floor tower, made up of increasingly challenging trials.

Your initial and perhaps overall goal in New Arc Line is to find a cure, of course, but who knows, along the way you might have to \"get your hands dirty\", \"rise from the bottom\" and become some sort of absolute bastard.

Calm down and stop waving that chair. A wanzer is a mech, in short. And Front Mission, by the way, is a 90s tactical RPG series from G-Craft and Square, both of which have since been assimilated into the terrifying robot octopus that is present-day Square Enix. Much as with Final Fantasy Tactics games, Front Mission games are stagey political thrillers about countries and corporations and other factions waging perpetual war upon each other, with players thrust into the mix as mech squad leaders. \r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Yesterday, if you can believe it, marked the tenth anniversary of The Elder Scrolls Online. That's a whole decade of tromping across Tamriel with your mates, and a whole decade in which I've watched tentatively from the sidelines, thinking about dipping my toes into the MMO pool, but never quite building up the courage (or lining the walls of my bank account) to fully take the plunge. I've heard all the horror stories about starting a new MMO from other members of the RPS Treehouse - particularly when it comes to the lore-laden shackles of World Of Warcraft and the bloated MMO-service-hybrid Destiny - and quite honestly, it's enough to put me off them all entirely. But The Elder Scrolls Online might just be the exception to the rule.\nI spent a portion of the game's tenth birthday yesterday playing Gold Road, its upcoming eighth Chapter expansion. In it, you're whisked over to the West Weald, an autumnal, sun-dappled region whose main city hub, Skingrad, will no doubt feel familiar to seasoned Oblivionites. Seemingly overnight, a strange jungle has sprung up on the city's outskirts, uprooting the nearby villages of the neighbouring high elves and causing havoc as strange beasts pour out of its curling root beds. There are more mysteries to unravel here, too, including the emergence of the new Daedric Prince, Ithelia (revealed at the end of last year's Necrom Chapter), and much more besides - too much to realistically take in during a 90-minute preview session, or for this MMO newbie to fully comprehend the significance of. But there's something about Gold Road and its gnarled-up jungles, strange cults and fantastical beasts that's definitely made me want to make a return journey here when it launches on PC on June 3rd.\nRead more",

This has long led to allegations that Roblox is exploiting child labour, generating value for Roblox Studio and its shareholders in the process.\r\n\n\"I don't know, you can say this for a lot of things, right?\" said Roblox Studio head Stefano Corazza at GDC, when the allegation was put to him by Eurogamer. \"Like, you can say, 'Okay, we are exploiting, you know, child labour,' right? Or, you can say: we are offering people anywhere in the world the capability to get a job, and even like an income. So, I can be like 15 years old, in Indonesia, living in a slum, and then now, with just a laptop, I can create something, make money and then sustain my life.\r\n\n \nRead more",

My grasp of reality TV basically ends with the finale of the very first season of Big Brother, feat. Nasty Nick. But you could argue that you don't need to watch reality TV to understand and enjoy reality TV, because the basic reality TV thrill of forming weird parasocial attachments to people who are role-playing as themselves is now the golden rule of digital society generally.\r\n\n\r\n\"'Reality' stuff is huge now, and it's not just reality TV,\" says Nicole He, designer of The Crush House - an enticing, absurdist and engrossingly unpleasant new sim from Reigns and Card Shark developers Nerial. \"It's any kind of celebrity or influencer or streamer or something like that - there are so many parasocial relationships in that way, and I think that really started with reality TV, and then [continued] in the era of social media.

You can also now cancel a Pal's break simply by picking them up and throwing them at the worksite - truly, a scene from Dickens.

Here's when you can expect to watch it, including the date and possible start time. \n\n\nStars like Ariana Grande, Marshmello, and The Weeknd have all appeared in Fortnite, playing a selection of hits for fans to enjoy from around the world. Now, with Coachella kicking off on April 12, it appears that Canadian Grimes will join that group. \n\n\nHere's what we know about the event, and when it's expected to happen. \n\n\nFortnite are linking up with Coachella. Image via Epic Games\n\n\nWhat is happening with Grimes and Fortnite?\n\n\nOn April 10, Grimes tweeted her excitement about playing new music at Coachella, while also asking fans to tune into the live stream on the second weekend because \"we're [going to] hack into it and bend reality with Fortnite.\"\n\n\nWhat that means isn't super clear, but with Fortnite and Epic Games involved, many have predicted that whatever is happening in the stream will also happen in-game, as part of an event. \n\n\nWhen is Grimes performing at Coachella?\n\n\nGrimes is performing on April 13 and April 20, but the Fortnite crossover is set for Saturday, April 20 and her second performance at the festival. \n\n\nThe times haven't been confirmed yet, but some suggest that her set will start at around 7pm PT / 10pm ET. \n\n\nWhether the possible event in Fortnite will start at the same time remains to be seen, but we expect that, like most events, it would be replayable for a period of time for those who miss it live. \n\n\nWe'll continue to update this article as more information on Fortnite's role in Grimes' set is released. \n\nThe post How to watch Grimes Coachella concert with Fortnite appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Invincible fans looking to whet their appetite until season three can do so by hopping into Fortnite, which has a new team deathmatch mode based on the show.\n\n\nTitled Invincible Universe: Rise of the Sequids, the mode was developed by Skybound Games and made available earlier today on April 11. Set on the planet Mars, matches are comprised of two teams of 10, with one controlling regular humans while the other plays as humans under the control of the Sequids, a race of alien parasites.\n\n\nImage via Skybound Games\n\n\nWhile described as a team deathmatch mode, it also bears similarities to Halo's Zombie/Infection mode, which has made regular appearances throughout the series, including Halo Infinite. If a human player is killed, they will respawn under the control of the Sequids. However, the reverse is also true; kill a Sequid player and they'll respawn as a normal human. A HUD slider keeps track of how many players are on each team, and matches only end once all players have been assimilated onto the same team.\n\n\nThis isn't the first Fortnite exclusive Invincible game Skybound has put together using Epic Games' Unreal Editor tool. It's previously released a free-for-all shooter called GDA Combat Training, and a more narrative driven PvE experience called Doc Seismic Attacks. Rise of the Sequids sounds perfect, though, for those who prefer team-based competitive games or simply want a break from Fortnite's regular battle royale mode. There's no harm in at least trying it since it's completely free, and can be accessed using the island code 6860-5764-7093. You can also check out a gameplay trailer on YouTube.\n\n\nRise of the Sequids comes shortly after the conclusion of Invincible's second season, which aired its final episode on April 4. This isn't the end of the show, though, as Amazon had already renewed it for a third season, but it obviously lacks a release date.\n\nThe post Fortnite launches a new Invincible gameplay mode called Rise of the Sequids appeared first on Destructoid.",

As part of this event, Warzone  has received the new High Trip mode, but what is it? We've got the answers. \n\n\nWarzone  players are always high, because when you launch into a map, you jump out of a plane that's soaring above the map. With the Blaze Up event, you can get a different kind of high thanks to the High Trip mode, which includes some special gummies that you can chew on. \n\n\nWhen does Warzone's High Trip mode release?\n\n\nWarzone's High Trip mode will release on Thursday, April 11 at 12pm CT / 11am PT / 6pm BST. The mode will unlock in the Warzone portion of the Call of Duty  launcher, so head there to try the mode out for yourself. \n\n\nIt's time to \"light up\" Warzone. Image via Activision\n\n\nWarzone's High Trip LTM explained\n\n\nHigh Trip is a Resurgence mode in Warzone, that means you will continue to spawn in when you die as long as someone else on your team is alive. High Trip has a twist, however, with gummies available that \"sharpen your senses and smoke out the competition,\" according to Activision. \n\n\nUnfortunately, we don't know too much about what these gummies do just yet, but we'll find out everything when the mode launches. Winning is the same though: Outlast your opponents and be the last team standing to claim the victory. \n\n\nWhen does Warzone's High Trip LTM end?\n\n\nLike any LTM, this mode has an expiration date, and Warzone's High Trip mode will leave the game on April 24. That's when the Blaze Up event ends, and will likely be replaced by the Vortex: Vi.Rus Mainframe event that Activision teased in their season three blog. \n\nThe post Warzone High Trip explained: New Blaze Up event limited-time mode appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Marvel Snap players are in mourning over the recent patch, which drastically nerfed Zabu to the point where some say he's been \"massacred.\"\n\n\nZabu has been a very popular card in Marvel Snap ever since he was introduced to the game last year. Originally, he would reduce the cost of 4-Cost cards by two, but was nerfed to only reduce their cost by one just a month later. Still, he remained a common inclusion in many a deck, so of course players were mortified to see developer Second Dinner rework his ability.\n\n\n\n\nAs of the April 10 patch, Zabu only reduces the cost of 4-Cost cards by one until the end of your next turn. While Second Dinner also bumped his Power from two to three, it seems few players think this is suitable compensation. Some of the more extreme reactions from users on X (formerly Twitter), such as haus0fXI and SnapMaterial say Zabu has been \"massacred\" or \"neutered.\" Both Horus_Xero and Jack Dawes think the nerf has rendered Zabu \"worthless,\" suggesting some players will stop running the card in their decks.\n\n\nOne of the top posts at the moment on the Marvel Snap subreddit appears to corroborate this, with someone posting a clip from the old X-Men cartoon of Zabu being left behind by his companion Ka-Zar. Another user, Anjan_S, wrote, \"RIP Zabu. You were the best kitty,\" while Mean_Carrot_1746 said they \"won't ever smile again\" because of the nerf.\n\n\nThere is one spot of hope in all this. In Second Dinner's patch notes, the developer stated it has \"a larger set of impactful changes later this year\", and Zabu's nerf is a temporary one to \"help us vet that work.\" So, it's likely Zabu will return to his former glory before the end of 2024. Although he wasn't the only one to be seriously hampered by the recent patch. Alioth has also been radically updated, with its ability to destroy an opponent's unrevealed cards changed to just removing their text instead.\n\nThe post Marvel Snap fans say goodbye to Zabu after latest nerf appeared first on Destructoid.",

While all of them are technically viable, some are definitely better than others. We've put together this Type Soul Shikai Tier List to help you choose which Shikai Elements are best to go for when building your character.\n\n\n\n\n\nShikai Elements Tier List for Type Soul\n\n\nThis Tier List covers all the available Shikai Elements in Type Soul, and includes their respective rarity. While each Shikai is viable, some are definitely better than others in all forms of gameplay. Those in the S Tier are always going to perform the best in most forms of gameplay. Those in the A Tier are still strong options that will have no problems, while those in the B Tier cater to specific strengths and scenarios. Those in the C Tier should be avoided if possible unless you just really like playing as it. As you may expect, the Legendary Shikai Elements are typically the best. Here is our Shikai Elements Tier List:\n\n\nS Tier\n\n\n\nBlood (Legendary)\n\n\nTheatre (Legendary)\n\n\nFlower (Legendary)\n\n\nIce (Legendary)\n\n\n\nA Tier\n\n\n\nInk (Legendary)\n\n\nZangetsu (Rare)\n\n\nWater (Common)\n\n\nLightning (Common)\n\n\n\nB Tier\n\n\n\nShadow (Common)\n\n\nBerserk (Common)\n\n\nFire (Rare)\n\n\n\nC Tier\n\n\n\nCreation (Common)\n\n\nConfusion (Common)\n\n\nWind (Rare)\n\n\n\nShikai Weapons Tier List\n\n\nNow that we know the best Shikai Elements in Type Soul, let's take a look at the best Shikai Weapons. This Tier List assumes your weapons are M1 stats, just to keep everything fair. Obviously, a weapon with proper stats while one has none is gonna be better regardless. Also, weapons like the Inkblade require the Legendary Ink Element of Shikai, so it is ranked based on its respective Shikai as a whole.

          "description": "Today marks two years since the official reveal of Kingdom Hearts IV, and while Square Enix hasn't shared any news about the game, fans of the series can celebrate with a new recording of the franchise's best song by Hikaru Utada. As pointed out on X (formerly Twitter) by Genki_JPN, Utada's new Science Fiction album, which they released yesterday, features a re-recording of \"Hikari,\" the Japanese version of \"Simple and Clean.\" \nIf you're a Kingdom Hearts fan, you likely already know which song this is. However, if you haven't touched the series in a while, or if you've never played the beginning of Kingdom Hearts, it's the Japanese version of the song in this famous game opener below: \n\n\nAs for the new recording of \"Hikari,\" its place on Science Fiction makes sense because its Utada's first greatest hits album, if you will, meant to act as a compilation with new mixes of old songs, re-recordings of fan-favorite tracks, and more. You can listen to the album, which features 26 tracks, starting today. \nIf you're interested in hearing the new recording of \"Hikari,\" you can listen below: \n\n\nFor more about Kingdom Hearts, watch the Kingdom Hearts IV trailer here, and then check out Game Informer's Kingdom Hearts III review. After that, read Game Informer's exclusive interview with Kingdom Hearts IV director Tetsuya Nomura for new details. \nWhat's your favorite Hikaru Utada track from the Kingdom Hearts series?

After the first episode airs at 6 p.m. PT/9 p.m. ET tomorrow, the other seven episodes will be available for viewing exclusively on Prime Video in more than 240 countries and territories worldwide. \nIf you haven't yet seen it, check out the latest Fallout trailer for a new look at the show: \n\n\n\"Based on one of the greatest video game series of all time, Fallout is the story of haves and have-nots in a world in which there's almost nothing left to have,\" a press release reads. \"Two hundred years after the apocalypse, the gentle denizens of luxury fallout shelters are forced to return to the irradiated hellscape their ancestors left behind – and are shocked to discover an incredibly complex, gleefully weird, and highly violent universe waiting for them.\" \nAmazon Studios, which is behind series like The Boys and Invincible, is producing Fallout alongside Kilter Films and executive producers Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy. Nolan directed the first three episodes of Fallout. \nFallout premieres on Prime Video on April 10. \nFor more, check out the teaser trailer for Fallout released back in December.

We learn about his childhood fascination with becoming a manga artist, the transition from college life to working at Sega, and his early career developing games like Devi and Pii, Golden Axe 3, and Sonic the Hedgehog 3. Iizuka remembers the excitement and challenge during the transition from the Sega Genesis (known as the Sega Mega Drive in Japan) to the Sega Saturn, which allowed the team progress from 2D pixel art to 3D polygonal modeling.\nNotably, the Sonic the Hedgehog lead reflects on the early Dreamcast days, moving to the United States to better implement western culture into Sonic Adventure 2, and finally, describes his emotions after hearing Sega was exiting the hardware business and ending production of the Dreamcast. \nSonic the Hedgehog Lead Reflects on SEGA's Road to Dreamcast:\n\n\nPlease subscribe to Game Informer's YouTube channel if you enjoy this video.

However, it looks like a second season is already in the works. \nVariety reports (thanks, Eurogamer) that The California Film Commission has awarded $152 million in tax incentives to a dozen TV shows across various studios to lure production of those series into the state. $25 million of these tax credits has been allocated to Fallout's second season, so production is now expected to take place in California. Fallout’s $153 million budget is the largest of any show on this list\nSeason 1 was largely filmed in New York, with some production in Utah. However, as Variety notes, receiving this tax credit does not guarantee Amazon will accept it and relocate Fallout's production to California for Season 2.\n\n\nFallout premieres on Amazon Prime Video on Thursday, April 11. The eight-episode series is directed by Westworld showrunners Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy, with Bethesda head Todd Howard serving as executive producer. The cast includes Ella Purnell, Walton Goggins, Kyle MacLachlan, and Aaron Moten. The show’s synopsis reads\n[Source: Variety]\nWill you be checking out Fallout this week?

Plus, Tae says there will be no microtransactions in the game, save for one theoretical exception. \nThis news comes from a new interview with Korean publication Ruliweb, where Tae explained that while Stellar Blade will have a New Game+ mode at some point, it won't be available at launch, as translated by Genki_JPN on Twitter. Tae also told Ruliweb that players should not expect any microtransactions in Stellar Blade, but notes that one exception would be paid collaborations with another company's IP. \n\n\n\"We want to make it clear at this point that Stellar Blade will not require any additional expenses that gamers are not aware of beyond what they paid for the package,\" Tae told Ruliweb. \"The only exception is if we create collaboration costumes with another company's IP; those may be sold for a fee. Also, there is no New Game+ in the launch version, so please look forward to it being updated very soon.\" \nGiven that no collaborations have been announced at this point, Tae is likely just checking bases for hypothetical collaborations ShiftUp may or may not be pursuing. At any rate, given the popularity of ShiftUp's Goddess of Victory: NIKKE game on mobile devices, it's possible we see an internal collaboration between those two properties. \nStellar Blade is an action game launching on PlayStation 5 exclusively on April 26. It was announced in 2021 as Project EVE.

Now, Uniqlo has revealed The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is the next game to get the t-shirt treatment.\nThe clothes will launch in Japan this month – Uniqlo is based in Japan – before a release in the West happens at some point in the future, as reported by VideoGamesChronicle.

However, the price could be raised when these shirts come to Uniqlo stores in the states. \nFor more, read Game Informer's review of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and then read about how the game has crossed more than 20 million sales in less than a year.

It's also how we learned the game will run at 30 FPS on Xbox Series X/S. \nSpeaking to German publication GamePro, Hellblade II visual effects director Mark Slater-Tunstill confirmed the game will run at 30 FPS alongside dynamic scaling on Xbox Series X/S, as reported by Wccftech. Slater-Tunstill told GamePro the 30 FPS makes sense with the game's more cinematic nature. However, if you're after higher frames, a beefier PC can likely accomplish that. \n\n\nRegardless of frames, Hellblade II is sure to be stunning visually. Developed in Epic Games' Unreal Engine 5, Ninja Theory told Polygon this engine has allowed the game's more realistic nature to be achievable, thanks to its Nanite geometry system and because \"the turnaround between scanning the thing and putting it in the level is drastically cut, and you can spend that time finessing.\" Be sure to read Polygon's full Hellblade II preview for more details on what to expect visually from this game. \nHellblade II hits Xbox Series X/S and PC on May 21. \nFor more, watch the latest Hellblade II trailer here, and then read about Hellblade II's photo mode and what to expect from it at launch. After that, watch this Hellblade II gameplay trailer. \n[Source: Wccftech via GamePro]\nAre you playing Hellblade II on Xbox Series X/S or PC? Let us know in the comments below!",

          "description": "Total Eclipse, a real-time, curse-breaking, 3D adventure (with a dash of Indiana Jones flair), is ready for public testing!\nOriginally unleashed by Incentive Software Ltd. in 1988, Total Eclipse added yet another groundbreaking title to their repertoire of revolutionary games.\nStep into the shoes of a heroic archeologist on October 26, 1930, as a total solar eclipse akin to the one happening today over North America looms over Cairo. Knowing of the Ardognus prophecy, created by the powerful high priest Hahmid III, you must find and destroy the hidden shrine devoted to Ra before the eclipse occurs.\nEmbark on this exciting journey packed with a trusty gun for blasting through doors or dispatching undead mummies; a compass to guide you through a treacherous pyramid; a wristwatch to track the precious time left; and a water bottle to fight dehydration (you’re only human after all). \nCan you solve this ancient mystery within 120 minutes and avert catastrophe, or will Rah's wrath obliterate the moon?\nOur modern reimplementation of the Freescape engine features graphics using hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Total Eclipse support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum, and Amstrad CPC. More releases are coming at a later date. Additionally, there are three playable demos if you want to test the game. Please contact us if you have some other release or demo.\nTo play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.\n>",

The titans of industry were inspired to produce more goods when I visited their factories. But as the years have passed, so do their eyes pass over me, to eye curiously my replacements. Will you try the new style, ma’am? It’s so much better than that old thing. I’ve watched my friends grow old and die. My brother got caught in traffic and caused a horrific level crossing collision. I get sick more often, wheezing to a halt wherever I am. When I visit the doctor for a spot of renewal, they tell me, “Sorry, I can’t help. You’re too old.” When will I be autoreplaced? Woe is the tale of the Balogh Goods Truck. But what if we could slow or pause the steady march of time? In OpenTTD 14, you can.",
