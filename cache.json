This marks the developer's return to its RPG roots following 2019's party game Out of Space.\nAnnounced yesterday, the game is slated for a 2023 release on \"PC and major consoles\", so it looks like a Switch version is on the horizon. However, it's not just the game's premise — where you play as a girl who gains magical powers by cosplaying and dressing up — that has us intrigued.

How the turn tables have turned.\nI'm able to win Nate around on at least one of my desperate bids to classify things that aren't eras as eras, although he does promptly shut me down on the most ridiculous one. It may surprise you to know that we don't actually talk about too many history games (although time travel comes up a lot). And stick around for a thrilling Cavern Of Lies.

          "description": "Hand Of Fate was such a singular thing. On the one hand, it was a tabletop deckbuilding game that saw you picking through roguelike-style dungeons by choosing different cards dealt out by its mysterious Dealer. On the other, it was also an action-packed hack and slasher, bringing its fantastical fight sections to life in fully 3D combat arenas - and there hasn't been anything quite like it since. Voice Of Cards certainly had a go, but its tedious battle system landed it straight on its own discard pile. Thankfully, we've now got the infinitely more engaging Foretales, a new narrative card game from French developers Alkemi, and it comes pretty damn close to capturing that Hand Of Fate goodness. \nIt doesn't ever venture into the realms of 3D admittedly, erring more toward the Inscryption school of tabletop combat encounters, but it does nail the delivery of telling an artful, swashbuckling adventure through cards and cards alone. And much like Hand Of Fate, this isn't a one and done affair, either, as there are multiple paths to take through this entertaining fantasy yarn, and several game-changing decisions you'll have to make as you try and avert a string of terrible visions threatening to destroy its anthropomorphic animal world. You won't succeed at preventing them all during a single playthrough, but its hard choices only make its overarching story that much more gripping. \nRead more",

Unlike the mere low-res images of abandoned Steam Deck designs we’ve already seen, however, these were mostly functional PC gaming machines. That’s according to Valve engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais, who shared a video of an early, more rounded-looking Deck booting to SteamOS and loading up Half-Life 2.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Gloomwood is, so far, a very good game, but it is also not much of a game - in the literal sense that it has launched into early access incomplete. There's currently just enough of it to play that it makes you feel both bereft and quite annoyed when it suddenly clangs its great iron doors shut in front of you. \"Let me in!!\" you scream, as you hammer on the silent portal. \"I really like Thief! I get you! I want to throw more decapitated heads as lures!\"\nIf you are one of those people who bases their gaming personality on liking the original Thief series, Gloomwood will have been on your radar for a while. It's a grimy, steampunk-ish stealth immersive sim with a deliberate low-poly vibe, and it picks up the abandoned Thief football to absolutely run with it. But, though the current EA build is but short, it feels like Gloomwood is aiming to punt that ball into outer space. There's so much more room to be playful and experiment than I expected, and it's so much fun that if you'd never played a stealth sim in your life I'd recommend Gloomwood. Except I wouldn't, because it feels like I'd be doing you a disservice to recommend it now, when the fun will be so quickly snatched away.\nRead more",

I suspect it's probably a similar experience to watching the carnage of Chivalry II play out from the safety of a nearby bench. The newly announced Warlander from Nier Replicant devs Toylogic certainly has the medieval setting in common with Torn Banner Studio's first-person hack and slash, but this free-to-play multiplayer warfare game is an altogether different beast. You control your warriors in third-person, for starters, and its more cartoonish visuals allow for, well, daft cataclysmic events like a flaming meteor shower to hone in on a player's position without appearing completely over the top. As it prepares to enter its first open beta later today, September 12th, I went hands on with a brief demo build to see what it was all about. \nRead more",

The type who are seemingly resistant to every single weapon type in your arsenal, or who invariably have big, scripted healing sequences just when you're about to nail 'em. \nIt's a phrase I often found myself echoing while playing Sunday Gold for review, too, both during its tedious, war of attrition-style turn-based battles, and while trying to figure out some of its more obtuse puzzles. BKOM Studios have tried to fuse one too many things together in Sunday Gold, and the result is a messy, somewhat artificial blend of Deathloop's style, Invisible Inc's tension and a more action-led focus on the cerebral role-playing of Disco Elysium. There's still much to admire in its stylish visuals and atmospheric music, but I also haven't been this cross playing a video game since Felix The Reaper, and that's saying something. \nRead more",

The suggestion that Assassin's Creed might become a live service online game akin to Fortnite was quite upsetting to me. Thankfully, VP executive producer on Assassin's Creed Marc-Alexis Côté (aka MAC) appeared on tonight's Ubisoft Forward livestream to explain more about Infinity, and I am slightly less alarmed but no less confused. Rather than a game, MAC says that Infinity is \"going to be the single entry point for our fans into the Assassin's Creed franchise in the future\".\nRead more",

The other part, though, is often entirely selfish on our part, just playing and writing about cool games we like. In fact, the decision to review many of the games we covered this week - Railbound, Jack Move and Roadwarden - were all down to having played and liked some form of demo, making events like the Steam Next Fest an increasingly invaluable tool in helping us cut through the noise when we inevitably enter mega months like September. \nRead more",

Every year in games there's a fat month, where loads of games come out and loads of them look really good and there is never enough time godammit.\nThis year that month is September. There are so many games out this month that look so much my jam that I want to spread 'em on my morning toast, but September is also the month that a lot of RPS staff have holiday booked - including me, for two weeks, which means that if these games do get reviewed it probably won't be by me.

In the game, it's the year everything went dark in this turn-based Japanese-style RPG, with a solar storm biffing the world's electronics. It threw the world into chaos, giving rise to the megacorps that now control the dystopian cyberpunk society where our heroine Noa is trying to make a living. In the real world, of course, 1997 was the year Final Fantasy VII came out, the seminal JRPG that Jack Move owes a great deal to (right down to its menu plink plink sound). Developers So Romantic have said outright that it's been one of the main inspirations for Jack Move, and its shady corporate powers and grungy urban landscape certainly feel of a piece with ShinRa's grip on the city of Midgar. \nBut the bigwigs at MonoMind aren't out to poison the world and suck the life from it in Jack Move. Instead, they're more concerned with using their newfound technological powers to find eternal life – a classic 'upload your mind to the metaverse' kind of tale you'll probably recognise if you've read any of the cyberpunk 101 novels such as William Gibson's Neuromancer or Permutation City by Greg Egan. Jack Move's story doesn't tread any new ground in this respect, but Noa and her hacker pal Ryder are a fiery spirited pair that make this six-hour tale of espionage and rebellion against its cartoonish villain well worth dipping into. Yes, you read that correctly. A JRPG you can polish off in a single day of play. Bliss.\nRead more",

Sure, I saw the main sights and had a great time soaking in the ambiance, but I know that I missed so many hidden gems.

You play as the titular roadwarden, who sets out from the city to investigate an unmapped peninsula with little more than their horse for company. Your goal as set by the people who sent you is to investigate the region and report your findings in preparation for the expansion of trade guilds in the area. But you can also set your own goal, shaping your character’s approach from the start in a way that helps with roleplaying a particular kind of adventurer throughout. And once you get to that adventuring, dozens of sidequests open up covering everything from gathering fruit to curing the plague.\nRead more",

They'd escaped the clutches of the French Inquisition and the hordes of plague rats following in their wake, and the pair were hopeful about finding a cure for the cursed macula flowing through Hugo's veins.\nAlas, when I pick up their journey in chapter six of Asobo's upcoming sequel, A Plague Tale: Requiem, Amicia is having a particularly terrible time of it. Not only is she suffering from an open head wound, leaving her unsteady on her feet, but rumours are flying in the nearby pilgrim camp about something bad having gone down in the last city they passed through. Exactly what is hard to say with five chapters' worth of context missing from my preview build, but the pack of guards who are hot on the siblings' trail quickly make it plain: several men died back in that city, and they're pointing the finger squarely at Amicia's knife, slingshot and crossbow. \nRead more",

I mean, there’s only four of them, and you’re forced to constantly perform tricks to regain ammo, which doesn't make them easy to use. I think it’s because of their more literal significance in the game. Rollerdrome threatens you with multiple enemy types called Houseplayers, all formidable, especially in the heat of battle when they combine their efforts. Luckily, the four distinct weapons you’re equipped with act as an equaliser; each weapon is a solution for a particular enemy. Developers Roll7 could have easily added a bunch of copied and pasted guns from every generic shooter, but instead they were more intentional about the weapons they included, with each weapon complimenting the gunplay and the game as a whole.\r\n\n \nRead more",

That's a whole lot of beautiful space pixels to blast into your eyes.\nIf you own the game on PlayStation 4 or Xbox One already, you can upgrade within your respective console family at no cost. Just use your respective digital storefront, either PlayStation or Xbox, to bump it up.\nOtherwise, Outer Wilds is currently available for $24.99, with the Echoes of the Eye DLC running $14.99, or $39.99 for a bundled package. It's also on Game Pass, as of this writing.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMcTusNAc5w\nA universe full of wonders\nIf you haven't played Outer Wilds yet, then good heavens, what are you waiting for? This time-looping space exploration game, developed by Mobius Digital and published by Annapurna Interactive, is an incomparable experience.\nWhen I was recently thinking about the kinds of stories you can only tell in games, Outer Wilds was one of the first to come to mind. It is warm and sentimental, cold and haunting, and expertly crafts its mysteries and story in the span of one galaxy.\n\nIts DLC expansion, Echoes of the Eye, is even more of the same. I think the base game hit me harder, as I knew what I was getting into once I booted up Echoes. But the trees, lights, and hidden puzzles of that place stick with me.\nWith the PS5 and Xbox Series upgrade out and free for anyone who's already picked the game up, this seems like a great excuse to dive back into Outer Wilds.\nThe post Outer Wilds and its DLC is out now on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, with a free upgrade appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Still due out in 2023\nThanks to a new Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty dev diary TGS trailer, we have a better look at how Team Ninja is approaching this \"masocore\" (their words) action game.\nFumihiko Yasuda (producer) speaks on how when he was pondering the future of the Nioh series, he \"started to consider a worldview separate from Sengoku-era Japan,\" and drew upon his personal love of the stories of the Three Kingdoms era. A story \"based around Chinese martial arts\" was a good fit to convey this idea, and was a perfect way to differentiate a new project from Nioh.\nWo Long: Fallen Dynasty will portray the \"turbulence\" of the era, with a heavy focus on the concept of the \"dark world,\" which will likely aim for a baseline intense experience. The \"fluidity of speed\" is a goal for the combat system, and we get to see a brief look at the upcoming character creation menu. Variation between players in an online setting was used as one reason for avatar customization, as well as a focus on a \"historical story,\" rather than a personal one.\nTeam Ninja is busy, as they also have Rise of the Ronin in the works, which also has Yasuda involved as a director (though we'll have to understandably wait until 2024 for that one). As someone who watched Team Ninja walk, then run, then falter, I'm just glad they're back in the mix again.\nAt this point with several recent universally-liked projects under their belt, new announcements are met with glee rather than a groan. There was a rough patch there capped off by Yaiba: Ninja Gaiden Z, but they really counterbalanced that with Hyrule Warriors that same year, into reestablishing dominance with Nioh three years later.\nThe Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty TGS trailer:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPDI4ehuA38\nThe post Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty looks better every time I see it, including this TGS showing appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "You've got until September 21\nAs we inch closer and closer to the looming 1.0 launch of Vampire Survivors, fans are getting antsy, myself included. Today's morsel is just a \"minor patch,\" but there's important news for folks on the sidelines: a price increase is coming soon.\nAt just three dollars, Vampire Survivors is some of the best bang-for-your-buck gaming I've ever experienced. And while typically Early Access titles wait until their full launch to raise prices, in this case, the game will cost more starting on September 21. The 1.0 launch is coming later — we'll learn the full release date in two weeks, on September 29.\nThe creator, poncle, explained this choice. \"To be frank, it's because otherwise I'd mess up the sales calendar for the rest of the year. I want to keep the option open to eventually enter some of the usual seasonal sales, and increasing the price on v1.0 launch day would mess up the timings, as price changes also comes with a temporary price freeze.\"\nPlayers have become so absorbed with the game's monster-exploding grind and fun unlockables that they've actually asked — sometimes jokingly, but often for real — for Vampire Survivors to charge more. I got my money's worth early on, and the updates just kept coming. I'm now at 55 hours on the clock. It's baffling when I stop and think about it.\nToday's patch is a minor one\nSo, what's new in patch 0.11.3? Most notably, I'd point to Blood Astronomia (Arcana XXI), which emits \"special damaging zones affected by Amount and Magnet\" for weapons like Garlic and Song of Mana. There's also the MissingNo character, who has randomized stats and can now be \"unlocked officially\" — find the full instructions here on Reddit.\nIf you've thought about getting into Vampire Survivors, consider this your call to do so before the price jumps. I can easily see it hitting the $10-$15 range.\nThe post It’s time to get Vampire Survivors before its price increases appeared first on Destructoid.",

One game has stuck with me since I reviewed it all the way back in March, and still remains one of my favorites to come out in 2022: the Southern Gothic narrative adventure NORCO that was \"inspired by first-person pixel noirs like Déjà Vu & Snatcher and rooted in years of research,\" according to the game's creators. Set in a dystopian cyberpunk version of New Orleans, Louisiana, the game takes you on a journey through the infamous \"Cancer Alley,\" an area of Mississippi that accounts for a quarter of the US's petrochemical production.\nNow, the game's developer Geography of Robots has announced that NORCO is finally coming to consoles with a PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Xbox One release on October 20. You can also play on Xbox Games Pass, if that suits your fancy. I obviously own NORCO on PC already, but I'm super excited for this release, because it means the game will be accessible to more players — and this game deserves all the hype it can get, if getting hype for old-school point-and-clicks is your thing.\nhttps://twitter.com/roboticgeo/status/1570188618647437312\nA press release from publisher Raw Fury provides more in-depth details on the game:\n\"NORCO is the debut title from developer collective Geography of Robots. Lead creator Yuts was born and raised in Norco, Louisiana, an acronym for New Orleans Refining Co., located in the so-called 'Cancer Alley,' a stretch of the Mississippi that accounts for 1/4 of the US's petrochemical production. The game blends real locations, personal stories, and Southern Gothic literature with a captivating original soundtrack featuring a guest track by Southern metal Band THOU.\"\nIf you're at all interested in checking NORCO out on your favorite console, I can't recommend it enough!\nThe post Southern gothic narrative adventure NORCO is coming to consoles appeared first on Destructoid.",

Of course, I’m excited to see how the upcoming Breath of the Wild sequel, which we now know is called Tears of the Kingdom, will innovate on the gameplay mechanics from its predecessor, but even moreso, I’m pumped to see how the story of the world has changed since we last checked in with the Hylian hero.\nWhen people ask me what my favorite video game stories are, they’re usually confused to hear that I add Breath of the Wild to that list.

Replacing the streets of Kamurocho with rural villages and ancient temples, the game follows the adventures of legendary swordsman and folklore figure Sakamoto Ryōma — essentially \"portrayed\" by Like a Dragon hero Kazuma Kiryu.\nThe new remake will feature an overhauled game engine, modern visuals, and tightened combat. In addition, a new \"soldier\" system will let the player call upon classic Like a Dragon characters for an assist in battle, including Like a Dragon 2's Kaoru Sayama and Like a Dragon 7's Ichiban Kasuga. As depicted in the trailer, fans can also expect a wide variety of dopey side activities, including some garden plantation, fishing, gambling, and, naturally, some Edo-era karaoke. Because why hot?\nIt might have been a very, very, very long time coming for western fans, but it looks like this new edition of the rare release is going to have been worth the wait.

In the Judgment titles, players follow trails of evidence, interrogate perps, and solve minor and major crimes, more often than not at the end of a skinny-jeans-borne spin-kick.\nMuch like its Ryu Ga Gotoku brethren, the Judgment titles are renowned for their brutal martial arts combat, stylish nightlife settings, and abundance of dopey, tonally inconsistent mini-games and side activities.

This new adventure will touch on \"classic memories\" of the Straw Hat Pirates as well.\nA pirate RPG\nWhile the look of One Piece Odyssey definitely seems like it's locked in, the other appealing factor is that this is an RPG. Rather than more action-oriented games that have rolled out for other manga adaptations, One Piece Odyssey is a role-playing game.\nHopefully we'll get to see more of the battle system ahead of launch, as we've only seen a few snippets up to this point.

We can likely expect the following weeks to pick up when it comes to raw eShop game output, with enough room from Splatoon 3.\nNintendo Download: NBA 2K23 Edition:\nAbsolute Tactics: Daughters of Mercy\nAccident\nAmnesia: Later x Crowd\nAmnesia: Memories\nAnkora: Lost Days\nArcade Archives CHAMPION WRESTLER\nBrutal Chase Turbo\nDevoured by Darkness\nDungeons 3 – Nintendo Switch Edition\nFamily Man\nForetales\nGold Crusader\nGunslingers & Zombies\nInnocence Island\nJack Move\nJapanese Escape Games The Mansion of Tricks\nKitten’s Head Football\nLast Beat Enhanced\nMozart Requiem\nPaddles\nPBA Pro Bowling 2023\nPlunder Panic\nPoly Link – Origins\nQueen’s Garden – Sakura Season\nReknum DX\nSacred Valley\nSAOMI\nSilent Sector\nSoulsland\nThe Dark Prophecy\nUnichrome: A 1-Bit Unicorn Adventure\nWayward Strand\nWindmill Engine\nIf you missed last week’s edition, here it is.

Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion is set to debut on December 13 on basically every major platform, and after a long windup, we finally have insight as to how it will play.\nAlthough much of the text and voiceover is in Japanese, it's very easy to suss out what's going on, as it focuses on the combat system first and foremost. We also get a look at the materia customization system, which can be used to change up your tactics and ability access. Beyond some standard enemy battles, there's also a look at a boss battle with Vajradhara Wu and Vajradhara Tai, followed by a confrontation with Ifrit. The latter takes several minutes to complete, as the game shows off its limit break system and Final Fantasy VII reminiscent soundtrack.\nI should point out: the video deals with a chunk of the first chapter of the game, and the story beats seem to line up similarly, thus far. So you're not getting a whole lot spoiled, comparatively!\n[gallery link=\"file\" columns=\"2\" ids=\"344604,344605\"]\nCrisis Core Reunion footage:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiVPAlh2yZU\nYou can compare it to the original here, at roughly 16:00 in:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bW6VnVlYPM\nThe post Here’s 13 minutes of Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion footage appeared first on Destructoid.",

Because of that, Resident Evil 4 is now also in development for PS4.

No exact date has been set for that as of this writing.\nBack in the saddle again\nThe Resident Evil 4 remake is the latest RE remake from Capcom. It's set to re-tell the events of Leon Kennedy's rescue of the president's daughter, in what's likely one of the most well-remembered entries in the Resident Evil series.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L1EuRo54pI\nRE4 was long-rumored to be in development when it was finally revealed back in June, and it's not a long wait until it's out, either. Capcom has locked in a March 24, 2023 release date for Resident Evil 4.\nThe studio is also planning on PlayStation VR 2 content. It's likely we'll see more of what it has planned for RE4 in particular at next month's Resident Evil showcase.

This will, in theory, allow players to confront each other just like back in the portable-versus days, and trade abilities with one another. Yes, it's highly reminiscent of Pokemon, like many other portable games of that era. Capcom used the phrase \"every series\" when they were talking about what games would be impacted, and later provided a full article regarding their online plans.\nWe had a few other bits of news too. On top of a fully voiced \"3D\" Mega Man main menu navigator for the main menu, extras include 1,000 illustrations and 188 songs across the represented games. You can find a reminder of what games are included in the Mega Man Battle Network re-release effort below.

As a reminder, \"layered\" is a mechanic similar to \"transmog/glamour\" in other games, where you can make certain items (or characters) look a certain way.

David Harbour has been cast to star in the upcoming Gran Turismo movie.\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, the Sony Pictures and PlayStation Productions feature will cast Harbour as a retired driver and mentor. Harbour has garnered notoriety as Hopper in Stranger Things and as the Red Guardian in the Marvel universe.\nThe Gran Turismo movie will follow a teenage Gran Turismo player whose skills in-game lead to him winning a series of Nissan competitions. And thanks to his skills, he gets a chance to become a professional racecar driver.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQEondeGvKo\nNeill Blomkamp, of District 9, is directing the project, with a script written by Jason Hall and Zach Baylin. Gran Turismo creator Kazunori Yamauchi is executive producing, alongside Hall.\nIt's set for a theatrical premiere on August 11, 2023.\nMore PlayStation pictures on the way\nSony has quite a number of different media projects and adaptations on the way, alongside Gran Turismo.\nThe HBO series of The Last of Us recently got a short teaser. A Twisted Metal TV adaptation has wrapped filming for the Peacock streaming service. Netflix recently confirmed its Horizon series is in development under The Umbrella Academy's showrunner.\nAnd that's not counting reports of several other projects in development, ranging from Days Gone to Gravity Rush.\nBasically, a lot of PlayStation franchises are getting their shot at the silver screen. Which, given the reception to Uncharted, could be a good or bad thing. What HBO has shown so far for The Last of Us TV series seems to be getting the tone right, at the least.\nAs for the Gran Turismo series, Gran Turismo 7 sounds like it turned out pretty solid. Hopefully that bodes well for its media adaptation aspirations.\nLead image via Netflix\nThe post Gran Turismo movie picks up David Harbour appeared first on Destructoid.",

At the end, we get a front-and-center look at the emeralds and the iconic Super Sonic power. \"Harnessing the power of the emeralds\" is a big part of the storyline this time around. As Sega puts it, \"The Starfall Islands are home to strange and menacing foes that Sonic has never encountered before. Using an all-new battle system, join Sonic in confronting these titanic threats with upgraded combat skills, evasive maneuvers, and a few familiar tricks up his sleeve. Jump into adventure, harness the power of the Emeralds, and fight to stop these new, mysterious enemies!\"\nAs you might have surmised, the trailer showcases the ending theme for the game once again: \"Vandalize\" from ONE OK ROCK. So far it seems to be getting more praise than the main theme, \"I'm Here,\" from Merry Kirk-Holmes of To Octavia. If I had to compare the two, I would be OK (ha) with cementing Vandalize as the main theme.\nSo far, Sonic Frontiers is ticking more boxes the more time goes on. Now I don't want to sink into the Sonic Cycle and instill too much hope! But the Cyber Space level showing really hit home for me, and there was only one way they could have gone since the shaky initial showing of the game: up.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XET9s-9PLas\nThe post The Sonic Frontiers TGS trailer gives us a close-up of Super Sonic appeared first on Destructoid.",

Now, we know when we can play it because Saturnalia has captured an October 27 release date. \nThat's when it will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via the Epic Games Store). Developed by Italy-based studio Santa Ragione, the team behind games like Fotonica, MirrorMoon EP, and Wheels of Aurelia, Saturnalia is shaping up to be a great time. You can find out why in the New Gameplay Today segment we recorded that's all about Saturnalia, featuring more than 15 minutes of gameplay, below: \n\n\n\"[Saturnalia] is a kaleidoscopic adventure inspired in equal parts by authentic Sardinian folklore and classic Italian Giallo horror films,\" a press release reads. \"The story involves a mysterious, centuries-old ritual that occurs every year on the night of the winter solstice in the Italian village of Gravoi. Each of the game's four playable characters must utilize their unique abilities and confront their own personal revelations in order to expose the secrets haunting the town and ultimately escape their doom.\"\nHere are some additional Saturnalia highlights from Santa Ragione: \nSeek clues in a maze-like village with no markers or compass to guide your steps.\nExplore the ever-changing town of Gravoi using matches to keep the dark at bay.\nFlight and stealth are your only options, as you cannot fight the creature that hunts you.\nImmerse yourself in the stop-motion animation and vibrant expressionist art style of Saturnalia for an eerily beautiful atmosphere that is as enthralling as it is chilling.\nControl your fate through non-linear progression and a dynamic, adaptive narrative, with unique endgames dependent on player choices.\n\n\nSaturnalia hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC via the Epic Games Store on October 27. \nAre you going to check this game out?

As any Sonic fan likely knows, collecting all of these will help the hedgehog transform into Super Sonic, a Saiyan-like version of the character that's faster and stronger. And sure enough, that's exactly what happens in this new TGS Sonic Frontiers trailer. \nCheck it out for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, this is the first appearance of Super Sonic in Sonic Frontiers' marketing thus far.

          "description": "Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has announced that its Yakuza-adjacent Judgment series will make its way to Steam for the first time. The best news: they're out on Steam today.\nJudgment and Lost Judgment come to Steam on September 14. This marks the first appearance of each game on PC (though Judgment has been available to stream on PC via Stadia). \nThis news is especially significant given that RGG Studio originally planned to release Lost Judgment on PC when it launched last year. However, that version was nixed when the talent agency representing actor Takuya Kimura, who portrays protagonist Takayuki Yagami, enforced strict policies about allowing Kimura’s likeness on PC. Both parties' inability to agree threatened Judgment’s future as a franchise since RGG Studio has pushed for more of its titles to come to Steam; every mainline Yakuza game is available on the storefront, for example. It would appear those issues have been ironed out, which bodes well for the potential of a third game. \nThe Judgment games are noir action thrillers that adhere to the same open-world design template as the Yakuza series. Though the plots largely unfold in Kamurocho, the series stars a new cast of characters and emphasizes investigative gameplay. Players control Yagami, a disgraced lawyer and private detective who works to unravel a pair of conspiracy plots. In Yakuza fashion, he also has his hands full helping his colorful clients and random citizens solve more light-hearted – or comically absurd – problems. \nTo learn more about each title, you can read our reviews for Judgment here and Lost Judgment here.",

The video showcased otherworldly imagery, including astral jellyfish, giant dinosaur-like creatures, and notably, a pivotal scene wherein Atreus appears to usher in Fimbulwinter, the end of the world, alongside Sköll and Hati – two wolves that are the offspring of Fenrir. According to Norse mythology, Sköll and Hati are two wolves who exist to one day spark the beginning of Ragnarök by chasing and devouring the sun and the moon. It’s pretty clear that’s what is happening in this new trailer, but why is Atreus helping them?\nAdditionally, it seems Atreus is hiding critical information from his father, Kratos, so why is Kratos following orders from his teenage son? Why is Freya holding a sword up to Atreus’ throat in the trailer? Is she holding Atreus hostage or trying to show Kratos the same pain she suffered after her son Baldur was killed in the first game? The trailer creates more questions than answers, precisely what I want from pre-launch marketing. \n\n\nWe’ll have to wait to find the answers to these questions when God Of War Ragnarök releases on November 8.

However, it's been a long time since the game has been playable on modern consoles. That changes soon, as the revolutionary first-person shooter received a duo of announcements today. First, we learned about a Switch version as part of the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack N64 catalog. However, we also learned the title (which was developed by now-Microsoft-owned Rare), is also coming to Xbox as a part of Game Pass and Rare Replay.\nWhen the game arrives on Xbox, it will include the classic campaign, complete with the original difficulty settings and cheat codes (no word on if \"DK Mode\" will be renamed to something more generic like \"Big Head Mode\" for the Xbox version). The Xbox version will also include the split-screen local competitive multiplayer mode that made the game such a mainstay for get-togethers in the N64 era.\n\n\nUnfortunately, it does not appear as though the online multiplayer available in the Nintendo Switch Online version will make the jump to the Xbox version. However, the Xbox version of GoldenEye 007 does include improved control options (including dual analog stick support), native 16:9 resolution up to 4K Ultra HD, a consistent refresh rate, and full achievement support. \nGoldenEye 007 is coming to Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One as part of Game Pass. Everyone who already owns Rare Replay will also be able to download the game at no additional cost. We don't know exactly when GoldenEye 007 arrives on Xbox, but according to Rare, the game will land simultaneously on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch Online.",

During today's Nintendo Direct, we learned the first two courses coming in the third eight-course wave of new tracks.\nFittingly, the first course we learned about for Wave 3 of the Booster Course Pass is Merry Mountain. This holiday-themed track first made its debut in Mario Kart Tour in 2020 as part of the Winter Tour. Meanwhile, for those looking for something not holiday-themed, Nintendo is also bringing Peach Gardens, a track that first appeared in Mario Kart DS in 2005.\nWave 1 brought fan favorites like Coconut Mall (Wii), Choco Mountain (N64), and Sky Garden (GBA), while Wave 2 gave us access to tracks like Kalimari Desert (N64), Mario Circuit 3 (SNES), and Mushroom Gorge (Wii). Each wave has also given us two tracks from Mario Kart Tour, with Wave 2 also including an all-new course in Sky-High Sundae. \nMario Kart 8 Deluxe – Booster Course Pass Wave 3 is scheduled to arrive this holiday season.",

The first free update, which came out earlier this summer, added the ability to use the leg strap accessory for entire soccer matches instead of just shootouts. The second, more anticipated free update is set to add a new playable sport to the package: golf. Originally set for release this fall, Nintendo today announced a small delay to the update, saying it now arrives this holiday season.\nThe Nintendo Switch Sports version of golf lets you tee up across 21 holes carried over from the Wii Sports series. You can play locally with other players or hit the links with up to eight players online in the new Survival Golf mode. In Survival Golf, whoever takes the most strokes each round is eliminated.\nThis free update to Nintendo Switch Sports arrives this holiday season.

Fae Farm is a cozy life simulation that whisks players to a world of magic and wonder where you'll flex your green thumb as a farming savior. \n\n\nAs the name suggests, the bulk of the experience involves running a farm as an adventurer and newcomer to a community in the land of Azoria. Though you’ll work to bring peace to this troubled land, you’ll also kick back and leisurely explore various environments, collect resources, and build homesteads. Fae Farm is built with cooperation in mind. The title features drop-in/drop-out co-op, both locally and online, allowing players to farm and quest together. \n“With Fae Farm we wanted to take our favorite elements of the sim genres we love, infuse them with magic and beautiful art, and wrap everything in a light-hearted cooperative experience,” said creative director Katie De Sousa in a press release. “I can’t wait to see what kind of cozy homesteads players build in Azoria.”\nFae Farm is slated to release during Q2 2023 exclusively for Switch.",

Where could they be? More details about this new title for Nintendo Switch will be revealed ahead of its 2023 launch.\"\n\n \nPikmin is a very special franchise to many people, but despite its niche popularity, it's never quite reached the heights of other Nintendo franchises. In total, the franchise has sold more than 8 million copies. Pikmin 3 Deluxe on Switch proved the franchise still had some (fruit) juice in it by selling roughly 2 million units in less than a year – a quarter of the series' entire sales – and fans speculated this had proved to Nintendo that it was time for a proper sequel. \nPikmin 4 was mentioned by series creator Shigeru Miyamoto back in 2015 when he told Eurogamer that it was in development and \"very close to completion.\" Time passed and then Hey! Pikmin, a 2D Pikmin spinoff, was announced and then released in July of 2017. Some speculated that this was the Pikmin 4 Miyamoto was referring to back in 2015 but in June of that year, Miyamoto told Eurogamer that \"it is progressing,\" seemingly confirming that he did not view Hey! Pikmin as the fourth sequel. Unfortunately, that was the last Nintendo or anyone there referred to Pikmin 4...until today's Nintendo Direct!\n\nNintendo showcased a short and sweet teaser trailer that gave us more of the luscious world of Pikmin before flashing to a title screen that revealed Pikmin 4 is coming to Switch next year. As for exactly when, that remains unknown  – Nintendo simply stated 2023. But hey, that's better than wondering when, if ever, Pikmin 4 would actually come out! \nAre you excited for Pikmin 4?

All of its individual actions are things we’ve done in other games, but when applied to this distinct cooperative approach, they take on a whole new life and are used in wonderful ways over a long adventure.

CD Projekt Red's 2077 anime, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, developed by Studio Trigger and Netflix is out (as of today!) and the Phantom Liberty expansion for the game is due out next year. While Phantom Liberty has been confirmed to be 2077's first and only expansion, it seems CDPR is not yet ready to part with this world. \nDuring the CD Projekt Group H1 2022 earnings call, CDPR's vice president of business development Michał Nowakowski said the studio is committed to doing more with this IP, as reported by IGN. \n\n\n\"We decided to develop one major expansion for Cyberpunk, which is going to take advantage of all the capabilities of the new-gen consoles,\" Nowakowski said during the call. \"Having said that, we're totally, fully committed to developing the Cyberpunk IP further, beyond this particular Cyberpunk expansion. We've put a lot of effort and time into building this franchise and we definitely want to continue to build upon what was built right now – with new stories, new experiences, new content, basically. Not just the video game format...in terms of expansions, there's just going to be one major expansion. However, there's going to be new stuff in the future.\" \nAs for what exactly, only time will tell but considering a Cyberpunk 2077 anime is already out, perhaps the studio is looking to dive more into the entertainment medium with this IP. As IGN notes, there's also The Molasses Flood, a Boston-based studio that CDPR acquired earlier this year, which is working on an existing CDPR IP. This could be something related to The Witcher, of course, but perhaps it's something related to 2077. \nIn the meantime, read about why now is the right time to play Cyberpunk 2077 and then read about what to expect in next year's Phantom Liberty expansion. \n[Source: IGN]\nHow should CDPR further develop its Cyberpunk IP?

As for why, the team didn't really outline the reason but it's likely due to the game's poorly received launch and its lack of players since then. Square Enix tried to remedy the game's issues by sending players a survey asking them how the team can improve the game and shortly after, Platinum Games said it has \"no plans to reduce the scale of development on Babylon's Fall.\" It seems things have changed because Babylon's Fall will fall early next year. \n\"With the desire of delivering an exhilarating online multiplayer action RPG set i…",

          "description": "Following the launch of PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, multiple video game publishers bumped up the price of new-gen versions of some of their games. While Ubisoft resisted that trend to this point, CEO Yves Guillemot tells Axios in an exclusive interview that it is making $70 the standard price for bigger triple-A experiences published by the company. \nWe already knew that the new-gen versions of Ubisoft's long-in-development pirate game, Skull and Bones, would retail for $70, but now it appears to be the start of the standard pricing for Ubisoft. In that interview with Axios, Guillemot stated that \"Some of the games will come at the same price as the competition. The big AAA games will come at $70.\" \nIn 2020, Ubisoft CTO Frédérick Duguet said that games released in 2020 would not reach the $70 mark (and they didn't, outside of special editions). Then, last year, Duguet said, \"In terms of pricing, we've been analyzing the competitive dynamics of the past quarter, and we are still looking at new opportunities, but we have not made any decision yet.\" Today's Axios interview with Guillemot is the first indication that Ubisoft has come to an official decision regarding its pricing.\nUbisoft is far from the only gaming company increasing prices. Publishers like 2K Games, Activision, and Sony have been selling select games for $70 since the introduction of the new consoles in 2020. Meanwhile, just last month, PlayStation announced it was raising the price of its PlayStation 5 consoles in select, non-U.S. markets. Skull and Bones, the first $70 Ubisoft title, is set to launch on November 8. It's worth noting that new-gen versions of Assassin's Creed Mirage are currently listed on retailer websites for $50.\nYou can read the full interview with Guillemot, which touches on subjects like the Ubisoft's troubled workplace culture, the company's current approach to NFTs following Ghost Recon Breakpoint's integration of them, and plenty more here.",

Selling 3.45 million copies since Friday in just Japan, Splatoon 3 had the best launch ever for a Switch game in Japan, as reported by Eurogamer. \nThis includes both digital and physical sales. It's safe to say the squid (and Octoling) community are off to a great start with the threequel that's exclusive to Switch. According to Eurogamer, however, despite the game also being number one on the U.K. boxed charts, as reported by GamesIndustry.biz, overall launch sales are down 9% compared to Splatoon 2 there. The U.K.'s boxed chart only included physical games, though, so it's possible that decline isn't present when digital games are taken into account. There's no word on how Splatoon 3 is fairing in the U.S., but it typically follows trends in the U.K. \n\n\n\"Nintendo Co., LTD...announced that domestic sales of the Splatoon 3 game for the Nintendo Switch system have surpassed 3.45 million units in the first three days since launch on September 9, 2022,\" a Nintendo press release reads. \"This is the highest domestic sales level for any Nintendo software within the first three days.\" \nIt's no surprise Splatoon 3 is selling well in Japan and elsewhere – it's great!

The team consists of anti-heroes Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh), Taskmaster (Olga Kurylenko), Valentina (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), Red Guardian (David Harbour), U.S. Agent (Wyatt Russell), Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen, and Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan).\nMarvel also treated us to our first looks at Secret Invasion, starring Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury and Emilia Clarke in an unknown role. And in just one month, we can watch the classicly designed horror film Werewolf by Night on Disney Plus. You can see both trailers below.\nThe Star Wars news is a bit lighter, consisting of our first look at The Mandalorian's third season, which looks absolutely bonkers in the best way.
