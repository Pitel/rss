Publisher Panic (alongside House House and Chromosphere) has channelled all those comedy vibes into a proof-of-concept short for an 'Untitled Goose Programme' that never was, and it seriously made us chuckle.\nAll of the Untitled Goose Game vibes are present and correct here: a quaint English town, a meddling goose, chaos, but it's all bent into a programme format reminiscent of old-school BBC scheduling. You'll watch as an increasingly ridiculous episode of 'Where is He Now?' is derailed by the titular goose, leaving its presenter and guest groundskeeper soaked, injured and with their life's work in tatters — not bad in four minutes, eh?\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

However, developer Natsume Atari has dared to attempt recapturing the lightning-in-a-bottle success of the iconic crossover series by combining those same ingredients into an all-new package: Reynatis. This fresh action RPG first hit the Switch in Japan in June 2024, and is now arriving overseas. We’d like to say that’s cause for celebration, but as enticing as a game that boasts some of the same key talent and gameplay underpinnings from Square Enix’s beloved action franchise may sound, we reckon this second go-around needed more time in the oven.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Fragrant Story and Papaya's Path is now available on the Switch eShop and (as you might expect from that name) it packs in the base game and its 2023 DLC expansion too.\nFor those who missed this one when it launched on the 3DS in *checks notes* 2022, Fragrant Story is a tactical RPG inspired by the classics. Created by indie developer William Kage, this short-but-sweet Final Fantasy Tactics-style experience was a little too slight for our tastes at launch, but this Switch release extends the campaigns of both the base game and the DLC, beefing things up to a 10-hour story and a 30-hour 100% completion — not bad when you consider the original lasted us maybe five hours.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The forthcoming Toxic Crusaders is going for a similar look, Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons was uncharacteristically cutesy, and now The Karate Kid: Street Rumble features a cast that look like they rolled out of a Gashapon vending machine.\nThat said, the aesthetic effort here is quite accomplished. Set in a pastel-hued mid-'80s Reseda, California, while locations are rather plain initially, they quickly improve as things progress, with one of the best-looking arcade centre stages we’ve seen in a while. The spritework is excellent, too, with cool characters who are both well-formed and animated, and have a nice finish in terms of colour casting. The pixel art is a far cry from the cutscene art, anyway, which kind of sucks.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Enough time, you’d think, to do a proper job of rejigging it with Windows spanners, especially after Final Fantasy XV’s port got so much stick for its lack of features and performance issues.\nFFVXI does make some improvements, adopting a full set of DLSS and FSR upscalers and frame generators, and its mouse and keyboard integration feels generally slicker than XV. Sadly, it’s still no first-rate adaptation, neglecting numerous PC features and giving low-end systems an even deeper kick in the plums. Cutting the quality settings can help, as per the guide down below, but overall performance is so up-and-down than you’ll likely never achieve a perfectly smooth ride.\nRead more",

But that's the problem: who is everyone? At first I thought, \"This game is for young kids and that's fine!\", given its relative simplicity. Then I hit some puzzles and thought, \"Ain't no kid figuring this out\".\nThen it hit me. It struggles to balance the fine line between being approachable for tiny tots and layered enough for people who've graduated from \"goo goo ga ga\" to \"oo oo aa aa my back hurts\".

UFO 50 is a kart of 50 games that once existed for an old computer system, all lovingly restored by a gang of coders. The old console, of course, is a fiction. The LX-I never existed. But it's a fun pseudo-history against which to create a grab bag of small games (some throwaway, others mighty) all designed with a distinct 80s look. It's an exercise in adhering to an aesthetic. Like an oil painter working with a limited range of colours, the developers of this bundle have stuck to a 32-colour equivalent of the Zorn palette. Yet play a little of each game, and you start to sense the smirk of chronos. These games aren't stuck in the past, but they are enjoying a holiday there. \nRead more",

          "description": "Why is every blockbuster video game now some kind of live service game? Speaking as a clueless idiot, the explanation I find most convincing is that it's an attempt to bridge the gap between the returns publishers want from video games, versus how much we're able or willing to pay upfront. \"Triple-A\" projects now cost exorbitant sums to develop, partly thanks to wider economic inflation, but also because publishers have spent decades teaching players that every sequel has to be More and Shinier. Premium game prices have not risen in proportion, and investors want growth, as they do.\nLive service games sneak around this difficulty by dragging out the time we spend playing them. Whether premium or free-to-play, they seek to install themselves as habits by means of regular, planned updates and additions. This is time that can be monetised by way of a subscription model, time in which other products may be sold to you, like skins and paintjobs, and time that becomes a commodity in itself, \"engagement\", which can be transmuted and exploited to various end. I'm not sure it's ever been expressed this way in any press release boast about longevity, but the unspoken principle/logical extrapolation seems to be that ideally, a live service game should keep us plugged in and plugging away till we die.\n Read more",

I’m not using the big P word just to throw out an overly worthy comparison to something we might associate with craft or beauty, but as a nod toward the game’s playful application of what I previously called ‘a euphoric splurge of murderous game verbiage’ one morning where I had clearly eaten my wordy Weetabix. The way its hurled knives and curb stomps and inexplicable decapitations flow together have an assonant, almost Suessian quality to them.\nBut it’s also, well, just a bit like Mad Libs. You play as Harding, a man who’s mythical lethality is established very early on. The showing is there in the moment to moment, but the telling is conveyed through cute tricks like how everyone you meet is so deeply afraid of Harding that they loudly keep track of exactly what weapon he’s holding at all times. The Mad Libs comes in through the fact that you can draw Harding a route between A and B, and it’s a given that multiple heads are going to come unstuck from necks along the way. You’re sort of just casually filling in the verbs that seem the most fun to you in the moment. One of the verbs is ‘hornet’. Hornet is a verb now.\nRead more",

          "description": "In theory, vampires and immersive sims go together as naturally as bats and caves. Immersive sims tend to involve a balance of stealth, acrobatics, raw strength and crafty manipulation, and vampires are celebrated for all of these things. Despite this, actual vampire-themed immersive sims are rare. My list starts with Vampire: the Masquerade: Bloodlines... and sort of ends there. In a devastating betrayal, Arkane Austin's Redfall wasn't an immersive sim but an open world co-op shooter (a not very good one). The much-delayed Bloodlines 2 was recently downgraded from immersive sim to RPG by new developers The Chinese Room. Arkane Lyon's Blade adaptation seems promising, but it's a ways off. \r\n\n\r\nHere to paper over the immersive vamping gap in the market is Byte Barrel's Trust, \"a new first-person shooter with immersive sim elements\". It takes place in a world where the vampires are hunted for their blood, which has become an everyday human energy source, used for everything from car batteries to streetlights. The irony! I feel like, in the circumstances, the ideal solution would be for humans to let vampires suck their blood in return for vampires letting humans use their blood for electricity, but that wouldn't make for a very thrilling shooter. Anyway, here's the trailer.\r\n \nRead more",

It uses a square aspect display ratio calibrated to give wizened Game Boy enthusiasts the shakes, and is made up of 200 single-screen rooms that \"slot into the larger puzzle-box of the world\".

We hope that the developers will treat us to a free-to-play weekend, in which our perhaps-unfounded reservations might be strategically offset by the endorphin rush of not having paid any goddamn money. This, V Rising creators Stunlock have now done. The game is free to download and play on Steam from right now until Monday, 16th September at 5pm UK or 10am PST.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The Mesoamerican pixelart landscapes, for example - radiant, cloud-hung platters of land with people and buildings reduced to daubs of paint in the foreground. The fact that it's about witnessing and surviving colonial invasion, rather than the more familiar European or North American video game fantasy of searching a New World for plunder.\nThe ensemble storytelling, with four, successively playable characters setting their own lenses to thickly entangled themes of sorrow, vengeance and growing understanding. The sparse, expressive dialogue, each phrase carefully tucked inside its speech bubble. The music. And the little things at the level of how you move, what you do. When you pick a faraway destination on your map, your character makes the journey screen by screen, which gives you a second to lean back and be a passenger, watching the horizon, at least until you're ambushed by a giant beetle. \r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Not enough Microsoft jobs have been splayed and flayed atop the Altar of Growth, so High Priest Spencer must once again perform the Rite of Strategic Repositioning. According to a leaked memo, Microsoft are laying off around 650 people \"to organize our business for long term success\". This is the same Microsoft that parted with around 1900 employees in January, and the same Microsoft that washed their hands of around 10,000 staff in January 2023, all in the name of shoring up the business for future prosperity. That \"long term success\" is certainly taking its sweet time. Or at least, it is if you're one of the poor saps in the trenches of, in this case, \"corporate and supporting functions\".\r\n \nRead more",

One that favours the joyous freeform sightseeing of an Elden Ring or Breath Of The Wild; where you’ll scramble up vast industrial concrete ruins on scavenging missions for inquisitive frogs, instead of being nagged by bothersome checklists?\nOk, rain check on that last point. SandWitch can’t help but eventually funnel the freedom of ambling around in your chuffy yellow van into restrictive collect-a-thons. Still, for much of its breezy runtime, this one’s a real panacea for gaming’s more bloated map-scourers. Plus, even when you are sent off to hamster-cheek scavenged components before making progress, there’s very little in this world that doesn’t feel intentional. Sidequests and storytelling crumbs are deliberately scattered throughout, and each building is a thoughtful concrete puzzle box. It is, in brief, a nice time.\nYou play as Sauge, a spacefarer returned to her planet of Cigalo after receiving a distress signal from her missing sister. Cigalo’s a cheery place, though economically and environmentally devastated after being exploited by an evil spacecorp named The Consortium. It’s populated by small settlements of people, some large talking frogs named the Reinetos, and the occasional friendly robot. Everything’s friendly, as it goes - even gravity itself. There’s no danger, no death, no damage from flinging yourself off the tallest building you can find. Just helping out your desert buds, upgrading your van with more gadgets to solve puzzles, or working on finding exactly where Sauge’s sister has go to.\n Read more",

The guns feel simplistic, the arenas bare, the loot vanilla, and the entire loop of beaming down to a planet and getting into small-scale \"showdowns\" threatens to become stale within the first hour or so. But then you find an outlaw buddy who offers a new way to shoot human dirtbags. Then another fellow bandit. And another. By the time your spaceship is half-filled with scoundrels and weirdoes shouting at each other, the game has warmed up enough to reveal its central idea. This ain't no grand FPS campaign, nor is it quick as roguelikes go. It's a snacky shootout sim with tumbleweed towns that feels best when you savour the pre-fight suspense.\nRead more",

          "description": "If you partake of some virtual rubber-burning, you might remember Ubisoft shuttered its open world racing game The Crew in March by turning off its servers. Given that The Crew is an online-only game, that signalled its death knell… or death horn, more accurately. Then in April, they tow-trucked the game out of people's libraries and revoked their purchases. This led to a backlash, as you'd expect, and Ubisoft are accordingly taking a different approach with The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest.

Pretty good, actually – perhaps not to the extent that you should tackle Space Marine 2 on a crusty notebook (or, for the record, a Steam Deck), but it runs decently on minimum specs and is noticeably more stable than in that preview. The only thing that might offend your PC’s machine spirit is some quality setting weirdness, where dropping or raising the graphics options can produce inconsistent results.\nRead more",

          "description": "While collecting money and upgrading landmarks in Monopoly GO, you may notice a Bank of Monopoly world appear on your map. The game doesn't detail what this is, but the rewards you obtain from it are worth checking out.\n\n\nWhat is the Bank of Monopoly in Monopoly GO?\n\n\nThe Bank of Monopoly is a world you can unlock as you advance through the game. As you upgrade your current board's landmarks, you'll progress through various worlds, with the Bank of Monopoly acting as a checkpoint. You can encounter the bank multiple times, with your in-game map showing when it'll appear next.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nSince Scopely is gradually releasing the Bank of Monopoly, similar to the Tycoon Club, you may not see this feature appear for a while. It stands out compared to the other boards with its gold banner and shining appearance, so you'll know when you officially have access to it.\n\n\nUnlike regular worlds, the Bank of Monopoly doesn't have any landmarks to upgrade. Instead, it's a reward map that gives you random items, which you collect by rolling dice for free and traveling around your board. The prizes range from cash and dice to sticker packs and rare chests. The rare chest has an exclusive board token, which I've yet to get my hands on.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThere are also blank spots, but they don't prevent you from getting rewards. Even if you land on one, you can roll again for free until you land on a prize spot. Overall, I got around 400 dice, two sticker packs, and a few cash bundles, giving me a nice boost for the Desert Bloom Partners event.\n\n\nOnce you complete your rolls on the Bank of Monopoly board, you'll claim your prizes and move on to the next world. Doing this also gives you your regular landmark completion rewards, so don't worry about missing out on that.\n\nThe post Monopoly GO: Bank of Monopoly explained appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "With all the balance changes, things are finally looking up in Helldivers 2. We’re now getting new Warbonds on top of that. That being said, is the Chemical Agents Warbond worth it? \n\n\nIs the new Chemical Agents Warbond worth it in Helldivers 2?\n\n\nIt’s hard to say yes or no to the new Warbond just because there are only a few items that would be worth getting it for. If you have the 1,000 Super Credits to spare, then by all means, go for it. \n\n\nAll the new buffs and balance changes overshadow the new items, especially with fire damage being back at its prime. On top of that, the weapons introduced in the Chemical Agents Warbond act just like the current flame weapons in the game. \n\n\nGas does provide significant AoE effects like blinding and dazing enemies. Those affected will also start attacking one another, which has a lot of utility. It’s just that things that incinerate enemies will kill them a lot quicker. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nAside from the new Stim Pistol and the cosmetics, you’ll still be way better off getting something like the Freedom’s Flame Warbond since most items there function the same as the ones here. \n\n\nThis isn’t to say that the new gas tech here isn’t good. They have very good crowd-control potential. If you’re just looking to get additional things to play with, then by all means, go for it. This won’t break the meta like the newly buffed Thermite Grenades or the Orbital Napalm Barrage.\n\n\nThis will act as a good Medal sink if you have been sitting on 250 for quite some time now. The 300 reimbursed Super Credits are nice, paired with the other cool cosmetics. So, unless you have spare Super Credits to dump into this Warbond, you can probably skip it for now.\n\nThe post Is the Chemical Agents Warbond worth it in Helldivers 2? appeared first on Destructoid.",

It will be released on Steam.\n\n\nIn Cabernet, you play as a newly turned vampire who has to incorporate themselves into a bunch of aristocrats. They call it a narrative RPG, but I think they mean it’s more of a social RPG in the sense that you get to put points into four categories of snobbery and can leverage them in conversation. There are also transformations, and you can eat the rich. It’s pretty rad.\n\n\n\n\nI previewed Cabernet over a year ago, and I dug it. It nails the worldbuilding, and the conversation system is pretty boss. My biggest concern was that this sort of game is deceptively ambitious. It takes a lot of planning to make a “choices matter” of this complexity. When you show a slice of the first hour-or-so of a game like this, it hasn’t even left the runway. After that, it becomes more sprawling and entangled, and it can be difficult to manage.\n\n\nThat doesn’t mean that it can’t be done, and Cabernet hasn’t actually given me a reason to believe it won’t. I’ve been surprised by a few games recently that have similarly taken on difficult formulas with success, so I’m hoping this will be another case of that.\n\n\nWe’ll all find out when Cabernet launches on PC October 24, 2024.\n\nThe post Vampire social RPG Cabernet uncorks the bottle this October appeared first on Destructoid.",

Perhaps the most interesting aspect of Lethal Wedding is its platforms: Sega Genesis and Mega Drive.\n\n\n\n\nI'm not as familiar with the Genesis and Mega Drive as our very own Zoey \"Retro Queen\" Handley, but for even a layman like me I'm immediately getting Zombies Ate My Neighbors vibes from Lethal Wedding, so sign me up. \n\n\nAccording to Mega Cat Studios, the story of Lethal Wedding kicks off after a drug ring of criminal clowns crashes a bachelor party and kidnaps your groom the day before the big wedding. Of course, it falls to the players, the bride-to-be and her mother-in-law to rescue him from the psycho circus performers. You know, just another day.\n\n\nLethal Wedding features couch co-op, over 25 upgrades, over 30 levels, fully animated cutscenes, and an innovative \"Vow System\" that gives you the option to earn upgrades at the expense of taking on new challenges in the ultimate risk vs reward situation.\n\n\nMega Cat Studios will be taking Lethal Wedding to Kickstarter on November 4 ahead of its Sega Genesis and Mega Drive release.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe post Lethal Wedding gives me serious Zombies Ate My Neighbors vibes, coming to Sega Genesis and Mega Drive appeared first on Destructoid.",
