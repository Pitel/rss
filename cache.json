          "description": "Games ideas, install base & system lifespan played a part.\nThe Wii U generation had a lot of potential but its life was cut short in the end due to the lackluster sales of the system. One thing that was never expanded upon was the ability to play with not just one, but two GamePads at the same time - allowing players to come together for some dual-screen action.\nWhile Nintendo acknowledged that it was possible, many have been left wondering why nothing ever came of this feature. In a recent interview with the YouTube channel MinnMax, former Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aimé has elaborated on this. Yes, technically multiple GamePads could communicate with a Wii U, but other factors such as the system's install base, lifespan, and no unique games or ideas for such a feature played a part.

Yesterday, the developer announced that the title would also be making its way to Sony consoles, and, alongside that, we got a really good look at the game's combat.\nThierry Boulanger, creative director at Sabotage Studio, shared a breakdown on PlayStation.Blog of the combat, which is heavily inspired by Super Nintendo classics like Chrono Trigger and Super Mario RPG. Boulanger said that the team had some very clear ideas of what they wanted to start with: \"there would be seamless transitions from navigation to combat, no random encounters, and no grinding\".

          "description": "Colour us impressed!\nThe humble Game Boy was an absolute marvel back in the day. Released prior to the SNES, the handheld system seemed positively futuristic when compared to the decidedly bulkier NES / Famicom. Looking at it today, however, there are plenty of noticeable drawbacks that have been ironed out considerably in the decades since with successors like the GBA, DS, and of course, the Switch.\nCrucially, the original Game Boy displayed its games via an LCD display that could only render four distinct olive green colours. This meant that many classic games, from Tetris all the way to Pokémon Red and Blue were effectively displayed in \"black and white\", leaving gamers to use their imagination to envision what their favourite game worlds would truly look like in full colour.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Size isn't everything.\nCygames may be known for its success in the mobile space with titles like Granblue Fantasy, Shadowverse, and Dragalia Lost (with which the developer partnered with Nintendo) but the company seems like it has an interest in translating these IPs into more traditional console games. Last year’s excellent Shadowverse: Champion's Battle showed that the popular card game could work quite effectively in the format of a JRPG, and now Cygames is doing it again by taking Battle Champs—a failed Clash of Clans clone—and repurposing it into a roguelite called Little Noah: Scion of Paradise. Though it’s lacking in new ideas, Little Noah does a fantastic job of giving players a tough, cute, and enjoyable action experience that feels great to play.\nThe story follows Noah, the chipper alchemist captain of a majestic airship, who quickly finds herself trapped when her airship crashes just outside mysterious shifting ruins. Here, she soon meets a snarky amnesiac cat (who is not named Morgana…) and a creepy villain called Greigh who both seem to have some kind of connection to her lost father.

Not us! But they did, and we're forever grateful for the existence of Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars.\nDespite Mario continuing to venture into the RPG genre with two separate series — Paper Mario and Mario & Luigi — we've never seen a direct sequel to Square's original Mario RPG or even a remake, only ports via Virtual Console or on the SNES Classic.

Aside from all my custom images having been eaten, probably with the closure of whatever photo upload service I used back in the day, everything else was pretty much in tact. \nBut man alive. Those OPINIONS. Just terrible. Bad, awful, narrow-minded. In some ways it's quite funny looking back at how angry I was about Nintendo putting trains in a Zelda game, for example (joke's on me, Spirit Tracks would go on to become one of my fav Zelda games of all time), but in many ways I'm just quite glad I've (hopefully) moved on as a person, if only because recent weeks have reminded me there are still plenty of people out there like late 00s Katharine who are in all likelihood the same age I am now.

You can just wander about enjoying the vibe and digging things up with your gentle laser as you go.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Like that smiling face with a tear running down one cheek emoji, I've watched friends discuss the trials and tribulations of a great Tigrex hunt and watched YouTube videos breaking down all the cool things you can do with the Insect Glaive.\nSo, with Monster Hunter Rise netting itself a bestest best badge and its Sunbreak expansion getting some serious praise in our review, I thought it was time to pull up my regular socks in the hopes that I could replace them with a pair woven from a big lizard's gooch.

          "description": "Madison is a fun game to write about. It's a puzzle horror game set in your traditional haunted house, aiming at a P.T. or Layers Of Fear vibe down the viewfinder of a Polaroid camera. Said camera was a second-hand gift for Luca's (that's you!) 16th birthday. It is also possessed by a demon, which is where the fun comes in, \"fun\" here meaning jump scares and hallucinatory clocks. Let that be a lesson to anyone thinking of getting their son something that was evidence in a murder as a present. This is one of many bad choices characters in Madison made. They are mostly now dead.\nThe game itself sometimes makes very good choices, though it's about 50/50 that it goes a bit too weird and ends up being silly. This makes for an intriguing mixture, especially with a complicated story of murder and neglect spanning decades, and by the end I was extremely fond of the way the sublime and the ridiculous sat side by side. The main let down isn't that Madison sometimes makes you giggle by accident, but that its multi-stage puzzles become so drawn out that you stop jumping at creepy angels and terrifying violin squeals. You've got numbers to write down and candles to move, and you don't have time for any demonic antics right now, godammit.\nRead more",

In my memory of it, I was an adolescent, which was categorically not the case and probably more a product of the booths at Gamescom being very tall, not to mention the hands on taking place so very long ago. At that time, the game was essentially the naval combat bit from AC: Black Flag, carved out and extended to be its own thing. Now, years later and with many delays and reworks bobbing about in its wake, Skull And Bones is back, and looking a bit different.\nThe current state of play for Skull And Bones was revealed with a livestream tonight, featuring an explainer video walking you through some of the game features, a chonk of the game in piratical action, and a surprisingly close release date confirmation for the 8th of November 2022 (there's still time for it to be delayed again!). All those extra months in the oven have produced a decidedly Sea Of Thieves-shaped bun. But this one is all realistic and gritty, more complicated, and is taking itself seriously. You won't catch Skull And Bones announcing its new season features with a comedy song, that's for sure.\nRead more",

          "description": "Dragon Age is one of my favourite game series. I replayed Dragon Age: Origins recently not for this column, but for fun. That's the kind of wild gal I am. Origins was one of the reasons I got into PC gaming, because my dinky laptop wasn't good enough to run it and I was desperate to play it after seeing the trailers. I spaffed some of my student loan on a new desktop and spent four months eating nothing but cheese sandwiches. At the time it felt worth it. Watching those trailers now is like opening a time capsule full of fantasy tropes and, for some reason, an incongruous chugging guitar song by someone we don't need to mention ever again.\nReplaying it now is a different experience. It's still a really cool RPG, notable for very good world-building and a cast of interesting characters (that you can have sex with in a cold tent), and it continues to hold a dear place in my heart. On the other hand, there's a whole section that's such a mind-numbing slog to get through that everyone hates it and there's a mod specifically to remove it from the entire game. Origins is a game I very much like, yet sometimes struggle to explain why it is good. But I'm not alone in thinking so, 'cos in 2009 this was RPS's Game Of The Year. Can't blame me for that. I didn't even work here then.\nRead more",

In the moment, they induce feelings of white hot injustice, but for many, they're an integral part of what makes XCOM, well, XCOM. Looking back on his time making XCOM 2, however, Firaxis' creative director Jake Solomon tells me that he, too, now feels the pain players have felt for close to a decade.  \n\"It was really interesting for me to return back and play XCOM a couple of years ago, and man, when I missed shots, I was unbelievably frustrated.

Emmanuele Bassi v zásadě souhlasí, X11 už nedostává žádnou novou funkcionalitu a framework GTK se již delší dobu architektonicky posouvá směrem k Waylandu, jeho API se tak běhu na X11 stále vzdaluje.

          "description": "Why Wai Wai?\nIt’s hard not to look back at Konami’s Famicom days and not get a little misty-eyed about how it used to be a fun company before the soul was sold out from under it by the corporate powers. It’s even harder once you look at Wai Wai World 2. Playing the game is like finding a horse murderer’s photo album and discovering it’s full of colorful pictures of ponies. It’s all wide-eyed and cute until you realize, “These were their first victims.”\nThe original Wai Wai World was a blast, just not a very big blast. It did its job bringing together a bunch of awesome Konami characters but did so into a clunky game full of annoyances. If you can believe it Wai Wai World 2 does the same thing, but with only one real annoyance: Upa. But then, babies ruin absolutely everything.\n\nI don't care…",

The Polish company has previously only published titles within its own catalog, but is now looking to branch out into carrying other studios' wares.\n\"We know the ups and downs and understand the challenges on both sides of the developer-publisher relationship,\" Tate Multimedia VP Paul Leskowicz in a press release. \"This makes working with third parties the logical next step, and we are excited to share our expertise with studios in the months and years to come. We know how important both retaining ownership of an IP and cash flow is for an indie studio and we want to make sure our collaborative approach and financial commitment give clear visibility and comfort to our partners in that regard.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQdVeknxAPQ&feature=emb_title\nFounded in 2000, Tate Multimedia is perhaps best known for its 3D adventure series Kao the Kangaroo. Just last month, the studio released a long-in-development sequel, which sees the antipodean hero traveling the world on a quest to rescue his sister while honing his fighting skills. Despite its somewhat under-the-radar presence, our own Chris Carter found it to be a solid, charismatic, and entertaining entry to the ever-popular mascot platformer genre.\nKao the Kangaroo is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.\nThe post Tate Multimedia expanding into full third-party game publishing appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It Takes Two to make a thing go right\nIt Takes Two was one of the best surprises of last year. I'm a strong believer that we just don't have enough couch co-op games out there, and gamers' outpouring of love for It Takes Two confirms that. There are plenty of good reasons why it took home Game of the Year at the 2021's Game Awards, and I think it's great to see such creative titles get the recognition it deserves. It Takes Two has continued to be successful after last year's award season, because this morning, developer Hazelight Studios announced that the game had surpassed 7 million copies sold.\nhttps://twitter.com/HazelightGames/status/1545422823899922437\nThe studio celebrated with a tweet that featured a picture of Cody's voice actor Joseph Balderrama and what appears to be a cardboard cutout of Cutie the elephant. Although Balderrama is lifting Cutie over his head, we're assured in the replies that nothing untoward is happening... sure, I'll believe that when I see it.\nIt Takes Two is one of the next games up in the long line of film and television adaptations, and we learned a few months ago that the upcoming movie based on the game will be produced by none other than Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson. Or, more specifically, it's being produced by Seven Bucks Productions, a studio founded by Johnson and Dany Garcia. Still no word on a cast or release date, but it at least gives us something to look forward to. Some fans are hoping for a sequel to the game as well, and I have to admit that \"It Takes Two 2\" is a pretty funny idea for a title.\nBig congrats again to the team behind It Takes Two, because 7 million copies sold is no small feat. Here's hoping that the game continues to have success in the future, and that Hazelight channels this momentum into another great release in the coming years.\nThe post It Takes Two surpasses 7 million copies sold appeared first on Destructoid.",

You're caught between a rock and a hard place, right?! The entire endgame is predicated on spending money, and the mixup between what constitutes pay-to-win and what \"equipment\" is really didn't do the game any favors. Now, Blizzard is saying Diablo Immortal microtransactions are OK because most people don't partake in them. What year is it?\nSpeaking to the LA Times, Blizzard boss Mike Ybarra does just that. Ybarra contends that \"the monetization comes in at the end game,\" and that \"the philosophy was always to lead with great gameplay and make sure that hundreds of millions of people can go through the whole campaign without any costs...from that standpoint, [he] feels really good about it as an introduction to Diablo.\" He also cites the \"high user reviews on the App Store\" as proof that there's nothing wrong with the game.\nSeeking a follow-up, the LA Times got a response back from a Blizzard rep, who noted that \"the vast majority of players aren't spending money\" on Diablo Immortal microtransactions, and that \"50% of players have never played a Diablo game before.\"\nThe idea that predatory monetization schemes are fine because only a small percentage of whales dole out chunks of cash is something straight out of an EA executive's mouth in the 2010s. It's old hat! Executives really need to get a little bit more creative if they're going to keep defending this stuff, especially amid issues like not even being able to release the game in certain countries because of the cash model.\nDon't you all have bank accounts?\nThe post Blizzard says Diablo Immortal microtransactions are OK because “vast majority” isn’t spending money appeared first on Destructoid.",

As the first publicly available demo in North America, it's sure to be pretty popular, so be sure to get in line early if you wanna hit the streets and other SDCC attendees (Disclaimer: Not in Real Life).\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSRqA4igQCo\nIn addition to the demo, Capcom will be showcasing some cool Street Fighter-themed graffiti art, painted live at the booth over the duration of the SDCC weekend. Attendees can then use the completed artworks as backdrops for photo opportunities. Smash that Like button. Or something. Finally, a special Street Fighter 6 panel will be taking questions from attendees about the new game, and offering up prizes in an impromptu trivia tournament. Sounds fun!\nOh, and if Street Fighter isn't your thing, well, you've got some attitude mister, but fortunately, the Capcom booth will also be hosting demo pods for its epic fantasy adventure Monster Hunter Rise Sunbreak and the latest of its 4000 retro compilations: Capcom Arcade 2nd Stadium.

Notably, this comes eight years after the Game Boy Color-based Pokemon Puzzle Challenge was re-released on 3DS.\nIt's our irregularly scheduled Nintendo 64 booster, and as usual, Japan is getting something a little different.\nHere is what the US is getting (Pokemon Puzzle League)\nhttps://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1545213151091867648\nAlternatively, here is what Japan is getting (Custom Robo, and Custom Robot V2):\nhttps://twitter.com/Nintendo/status/1545212433035595776\nAs a recap, Pokemon Puzzle League was released in the US in 2000, as part of the Puzzle League, or, Panel de Pon series. It was basically a \"branded version\" of Panel de Pon, a franchise that came over as Tetris Attack and was immortalized ever since. Although a lot of people are going to write off \"a puzzle game coming to Switch Online,\" if you haven't played it, give it a shot! Panel de Pon is a classic for a reason, and Pokemon Puzzle League does a great job of getting the core gameplay tenets of the series across.\nThat said, it would be fantastic to get Custom Robo as well, even if it was in untranslated form. This is where having multiple region accounts comes in handy, as I can just swap over to my Japanese login and play them if I want!\nThe post Western Switch Online gets Pokemon Puzzle League, Japan gets two Custom Robo games appeared first on Destructoid.",

A release date was not confirmed.]\nOne of our favorite spoilers, the Australian Classification ratings board, has updated its website with a new PlayStation listing for Daniel Mullins Games' deck-builder Inscryption, suggesting that the spooky roguelike card game is headed to PS4 in the very near future.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPBP3kWDcNk\nReleased on PC in the fall of 2021, Inscryption turned plenty of heads in double-quick time with its incredibly creepy and disturbing aesthetic, compelling strategy gameplay, and fascinating \"found footage\" framing device. The indie hit would go on to feature in many Best of Year lists, even winning the Game of the Year award at the prestigious Game Developers Choice Award and the Seamus McNally Grand Prize at the Independent Games Awards.\nWhile the title is yet to receive an announcement of any such port, this new rating all but confirms that Inscryption is headed to the console market. While this rating is strictly for PlayStation platforms, it is difficult to imagine that publisher Devolver Digital will not also be looking to release on Xbox and Nintendo Switch.

          "description": "Now you can take Dicey Dungeons on the go\nDicey Dungeons is one of those \"if you know, you know\" indie games — it's garnered something of a cult following over the past three years that it's been out, and for good reason (we gave it a 10 in our review). The charming visuals, unique concept, and engaging gameplay have made the game a continued success, and after some releases for Nintendo Switch and Xbox, Dicey Dungeons is finally getting a mobile release for iOS and Android. In addition to the new platform, the game is also getting a free DLC update called Reunion, which will give players 4-5 hours of new gameplay released in six episodes.\nThe game's creator Terry Cavanagh dropped the news earlier today on his Twitter — he's also known for creating other titles like VVVVVV and Super Hexagon. Cavanagh has secured his spot as a prolific game designer in the indie space, so it's really cool to see his games continue to have life and community surrounding them long after their releases.\nhttps://twitter.com/terrycavanagh/status/1545076959444717569\nNot only will Dicey Dungeons run well on mobile devices, but its gameplay actually suits the platform really well. Roguelikes are great to play in short bursts, and since it's turn-based, you don't have to be glued to the screen every second if you don't want to be. That makes Dicey Dungeons perfect for playing on your phone during a commute, or when you're waiting at the DMV, or when you're doing literally anything else.\nCavanagh even confirmed in the replies to his initial tweet that you can easily stop in the middle of a run and continue it later without losing any of your progress.\nDicey Dungeons is available for $4.99 on iOS and Android, and the free DLC update is live now as well. The game's composer Chipzel also released the DLC soundtrack on Bandcamp if you want to take a listen to that as well.\nThe post Adorable roguelike Dicey Dungeons gets a mobile release, new DLC appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The King of the Koopas gets a LEGO makeover\nMaking LEGO sets that are designed with adults in mind is one of the best decisions the company ever made, because LEGO has released some really awesome, complex builds over the past few years. Just in their Nintendo collaboration alone, which debuted in 2020, they gave us the buildable NES and the \"?\" block with different levels from Super Mario 64 on the inside. LEGO's newest release is another banger in the Mario-themed line: a giant Bowser that shoots fireballs.\nI have to admit that I haven't played with LEGO since I was a kid, but man, they've really stepped up their game over the past few years. The Might Bowser figure is made of up over 3,000 pieces, some of which were designed specifically for this build. He's incredibly detailed, but this Bowser doesn't just look great — you can move his head around and shoot a little LEGO fireball out of his mouth. In addition, the Senior Designer on the project Carl Merriam says that they \"took inspiration from a few forms of puppetry\" and added loose joints to Bowser's legs and tail so he looks like he's jumping when you pick him up.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UKbllLOr44\nBut wait, there's more! LEGO fans who own a LEGO Super Mario Starter Course can actually battle against Bowser with Mario, Luigi, or Peach.\nBasically, if you take your little interactive figure from that set and bounce it on Bowser, it will make noises from the game and play battle animations. How cool is that? It's that extra attention to detail that makes this a really impressive build, in my opinion.\nThe Mighty Bowser figure hits stores on October 1, 2022, and will retail for $269.99 on the LEGO website or wherever LEGO is sold, so start saving up now if you're dying to add him to your collection!\nThe post LEGO Super Mario’s latest release is a giant Bowser that shoots fireballs appeared first on Destructoid.",

The revamped release will be available to purchase on both platforms from September 6, with free upgrades offered to PS4 and Xbox One Biomutant players.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PismKvxhFpc\nReleased in the spring of 2021 after a particularly lengthy development period, Biomutant is an ecological tale of a fantasy world under siege from a mysterious and creeping corruption. Players guide a fully customizable character through the anthropomorphic society on a mission to rescue the Tree of Life, the roots of which are decaying due to the corruption's presence. Developed by Experiment 101, Biomutant was an extremely ambitious project, that unfortunately launch to very middling reviews, though it was praised for its impressive visuals and interesting custom character mechanics.\nThis new edition of Biomutant will offer players three distinct visual modes on PS5 and Xbox Series X. \"Quality,\" which will run at 30 FPS  at a 4K resolution; \"Quality Unleashed,\" which will run at \"40-plus\" FPS at a 4K resolution; and \"Performance,\" which will run at 60 FPS at 1440p. For Xbox Series S users, these three modes will run at 1440p, 1440p, and 1080p respectively. The PS5 edition will also be optimized for the DualSense, offering support for Haptic Feedback, adaptive triggers, and speaker sound.

Digital artist Finn shared the latest footage of their Super Mario RPG remake on Twitter, which reworks the graphical system of the game into a new charming modern style.\nNote that Finn has their response to the \"but you shouldn't share these types of things online\" statement already ready to go:\n\"Just thought I’d put this out there since I’ve seen some stuff floating around: My SMRPG project, while made in a game engine, will not be available to play, for legal reasons:) similarly, I do not plan to remake a significant portion of the game as to not infringe on copyright.\"\n\nThat's why I put the phrase \"mockup\" in the headline. While this was initially shared around as a project that could see the light of day, Finn cleared things up themselves; noting that they wanted to share their artistry with the world without distributing it, or remaking the entire game.\nStill, you love to see it. These types of fan projects lead to full official releases more often than you'd think, and although it would take a lot of legwork to get this one off the ground, I hope it happens one day.\nhttps://twitter.com/huckori/status/1542926937055588352\nThe post A Super Mario RPG fan remake mockup?

Regardless of the depressing state of our country, the holiday got me thinking about Americana in video games and how they depict our country, for better and for worse.\nAside from Japan, the United States is the world’s leader in video game production, so it makes perfect sense that developers would borrow themes, imagery, and iconography from their country of origin.

That was the question asked by Studio FYQD's dynamic PC actioner Bright Memory: Infinite. And soon, console owners can find the answer to that query themselves, with a PS5, Xbox Series X, and Switch port releasing on July 21.\nThe work of almost a single developer, Bright Memory: Infinite tells the anime-infused tale of Shelia, a special agent dispatched to scenes of inexplicable anomalies. Kitted out with some incredible firepower and acrobatic, air-slicing sword skills, Shelia finds herself embroiled in interdimensional chaos, fighting off an army of invaders and questionable governmental conspirators in the eye of a raging storm.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AhrdkGVV2Q\nWhile the trailers may give something of an impression of a full-price, 30-hour adventure, it should be noted that Bright Memory: Infinite is a very short affair, working better as a flashy score-attack title, to be played and replayed in efforts to achieve a slicker and more balletic performance each time. It's undeniably a fabulous-looking title, and the talent of its one-man team cannot be understated, but it's certainly something of an acquired taste. I dig it.\nBright Memory: Infinite is available now on PC, it will arrive on PS5, Xbox Series X, and Nintendo Switch on July 21.

Genre, scope, and budget are all top of mind when it comes to licensed games like this. And to me, this team is a wildcard. I am vaguely into the idea of fighting for life in an intimidating machine-dominated world, though.\nAre you open to a Skynet survival game, or have you had your fill of Terminator tie-ins by now?

That's what Robocop is programmed to do, and you'll soon get the chance to see the world through his visor in Robocop: Rogue City, a new game from developer Teyon and publisher Nacon. Peter Weller, the actor who became Robocop in the feature film, is reprising his role, bringing both his likeness and voice to this iconic '80s character.\nThe trailer above shows off roughly one minute of gameplay. Robocop's precision targeting is on display, as is his brute strength, which he uses to effortlessly push dumpsters and hurl enemies through the air. Rogue City tells a new story set around the same time as Paul Verhoeven's movie and somehow brings the powerful reboot ED-209 back into the mix.\nTeyon is the development house that released Terminator: Resistance. which recently was enhanced for new-gen machines. Robocop: Rogue City is slated to release in June 2023 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.",

According to information coming from Japan, Takahashi was found floating in shallow waters on the coast of Nago City on the Island of Okinawa by the country’s Coast Guard yesterday, July 6. He was wearing snorkeling gear when found by the Coast Guard. Both the Coast Guard and local police are investigating his death. \nTakahashi’s manga career began in 1982, but it didn’t truly take off until the release of Yu-Gi-Oh! in 1996. In between his start and Yu-Gi-Oh!, though, Takahashi published titles like Fighting Hawk and Tennenshoku Danji Buray, according to Kotaku. After Yu-Gi-Oh! hit shelves in 1996, the series only continued to grow in popularity, spawning a real-life card game in 1999 (that’s still extremely popular today) as well as multiple anime series. Today, the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise spans not just manga, card games, and anime, but video games as well, like this year’s Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel. \n[Source: NHK via IGN]\nThe staff at Game Informer extends their condolences to Takahashi’s family.",

Here’s what the official site has to say on the matter: \nThe Matrix Awakens was first announced and made available on the same night during the 2021 Game Awards. The Unreal Engine 5-powered demonstration from Epic Games stars Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss, who introduces the impressive graphics engine and how close to real-life its visuals can look. Awakens includes an on-rails car shootout throughout a city that often looks like it was ripped from the silver screen despite being rendered on the spot. The demo then lets you roam the massive pre-populated city and change things like time of day or traffic congestion to flex what UE5 is capable of. It’s a terrific showcase for the future of games, so if you haven’t given it a download yet, you’ll want to check it out before the delisting on Saturday.\nYou can watch us tour The Matrix Awakens in this episode of New Gameplay Today.",

That’s because the studio is launching Gwent: Rogue Mage, a new single-player roguelike deckbuilder, tomorrow. \nAnnounced by IGN, Gwent: Rogue Mage launches tomorrow, July 7, on PC, iOS, and Android. IGN reports that this game is what Project Golden Nekker, which the team revealed earlier this year, has turned into, and CD Projekt Red is marketing it as a single-player expansion to Gwent: The Witcher Card Game. However, you won’t need to own that because Rogue Mage is standalone. You can purchase the standalone version for $9.99 or the premium edition, which includes in-game skins and cosmetics, and card packs for the multiplayer portion of Gwent, for $19.99. \n“Rogue Mage came out of us noticing that years after The Witcher 3’s release, there are a significant number of players who want a more PvE experience from Gwent,” game director Vladimir Tortsov told IGN. “While Gwent multiplayer is a fantastic game for those who are looking for a great PvP multiplayer experience, we perfectly understand that many Witcher players loved the original mini-game of Gwent for totally different reasons. With Rogue Mage, we aim to give this audience a reason to play modern-day Gwent in the format they prefer.” \nIGN has an exclusive preview of Gwent: Rogue Mage after going hands-on with it ahead of tomorrow’s release, and if you’re looking for even more details about it, including what this single-player deckbuilder roguelike’s gameplay is like, be sure to check it out. \n[Source: IGN]\nAre you excited to check out Gwent: Rogue Mage?

Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth will also be sold separately on PS5/PS4 on September 29, so you don’t need to buy the Digital Deluxe Edition to play it. Additionally, after buying Elysium on PS4, you’ll also get access to the PS5 version. \nPre-ordering Valkyrie Elysium on Steam grants the 72-hour early access window and unique wallpapers. Its Digital Deluxe version also tosses in the Svartaljr: Sword of the Goddess of the Underworld. \nValkyrie Elysium will launch first on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on September 29. It then arrives on Steam on November 11.",

          "description": "Forspoken, Square Enix’s upcoming action RPG, will no longer launch in October and has been pushed to January 24.\nIn a post on the game’s Twitter page, developer Luminous Productions, a team made up of Final Fantasy XV developers, states that Forspoken is largely complete and is in the final polishing phase. It describes the delay as a “strategic decision” and that we’ll learn more about the game in the near future. \nForspoken is no stranger to delays, as it was originally slated to arrive on May 24 before getting pushed to October 11. Though this second delay isn’t as long, it’s disappointing that we won’t get to experience Frey Holland’s adventure this year, but we trust that the delay will only help get the game up to snuff. The adventure drops Frey, a modern-day New Yorker, in the fantasy world of Athia where she acquires magical powers and a sentient talking bracelet. She’ll use her newfound abilities to free Athia from tyranny while also searching for a way back to her world. \nForspoken graced Game Informer’s cover in March, and you can catch up on a month’s worth of exclusive features and videos here.",

The new trailer released today is short and sweet but still packs a godly punch. Clocking in at just 30 seconds, we see Kratos and Atreus fending off some standard mob enemies before coming face to face with a gigantic black wolf. \nCheck out the cinematic \"Father and Son\" trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nFans of Norse mythology might recognize this beast as Fenrir, the son of Loki. Fenrir plays a significant part in the Norse story of Ragnarok, but we won't spoil that here. Plus, Ragnarok's take on Fenrir could be completely different anyway.

This 1994 Super Famicom RPG is from creator Takashi Tokita, one of the key developers behind Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy IV. While it would be fascinating to play through Tokita's original vision of Live a Live, we're getting an enhanced remake using the same HD-2D graphical style from the Octopath Traveler games.\nI recently spent roughly five hours in this ambitiously designed title, and can confidently say I enjoyed almost every second of its unique approach to storytelling and how it's brought to life through beautiful retro visuals. Square Enix is releasing Live a Live on Switch on July 22. Here are a handful reasons why you should put it on your radar:\nSeven Distinct Stories\nA Fun Assortment of Characters\nAdult Language and Humor?\nExcellent Writing\nCombat Has Depth...But Will We See It Enough?\n\n\nIt's Beautiful\nThe 2D-HD look is every bit as stunning as it is in Octopath Traveler. The backdrops in each story are a feast for the eyes. The sprite characters don't offer much animation but do move appropriately to convey an emotion or to highlight a dramatic sequence. The visuals scream of the 16-bit age, but also have modern touches everywhere, like realistic lighting of saloon doors swinging when the stranger strolls in to grab a drink.",

Skull and Bones showed promise when it was first announced during an E3 press conference in 2017. Slated to release in the following year, it was indefinitely delayed, even thought to be canceled given the lack of updates from Ubisoft. With fresh wind behind its sails, we will now see what it looks like on current-gen platforms. Come Thursday, you can view the Ubisoft Forward livestream right here.\nUbisoft also revealed a second livestream slated to air on September 10. We don't know what games are in this presentation, but Ubisoft's blog says it will be for multiple projects. Here's hoping Star Wars, Avatar, Assassin's Creed, and Splinter Cell are mentioned in some capacity, if not outright shown.\nUntil then, are you excited for Skull & Bones?

But like a person floating above the ground in the glow of an abducto beam, those moments aren’t connected to anything substantial; they just make some noise and get flung aside.\" The remake of the sequel modernizes more of the content.

Kicking off his first adventure in 1992, Kirby has grown into a juggernaut in the game industry, starring in dozens of titles and making appearances in countless others. The long-running franchise is among video games’ best-selling. One of its most successful titles, Kirby and the Forgotten Land, released in March 2022.

          "description": "Starting a cult isn’t easy work, but somebody’s got to do it in Massive Monster’s Cult of the Lamb, which hits consoles and PC next month. Fortunately, the team behind the devilishly cute game has released a new trailer with tips and tricks to start, and maintain, the best cult.\nThe first step is simple: grow your flock. All you need to do is fight through hordes of demon monsters to save innocent woodland creatures that will make for perfect initiates. Of course, you rename each addition and select other facets of their new life to dictate what kind of cult member (and worker) they’ll be for you.\nCheck it out in action: \n\n\nAs you can see in the trailer above, growing your flock is just the first step. You also need to satisfy the faithful. To do this, you must tend to your congregation by leading and feeding them and ultimately keeping them happy. You can give them gifts, invite them to feasts, and much more. The final step is to cleanse the non-believers, naturally. \nUnhappy cult members might lose faith in you, but this is fixable. You can opt to re-educate them in the ways of your cult, which will hopefully stop them from persuading other members to rise against you, or, if you just can’t see a solution, you can always sacrifice them to the gods. \nAnd there you have it – you’re ready to start a cult. For more, watch Game Informer’s exclusive Cult of the Lamb New Gameplay Today, which features never-before-seen gameplay, and then watch this new gameplay trailer that recently debuted during Summer Game Fest, which is where we learned Cult of the Lamb will come to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on Aug. 11. \nAre you excited for Cult of the Lamb?

The idea of getting a demo this year is certainly enticing too, as Sea of Stars has looked phenomenal every time it’s made an appearance. \nThe game was first revealed in 2020 after a successful Kickstarter campaign and evokes JRPGs like Chrono Trigger, Illusion of Gaia, and Breath of Fire. It even features music contributions by Chrono Trigger composer Yasunori Mitsuda. Despite being a role-playing title, it serves as a prequel to 2018’s The Messenger, a Ninja Gaiden-inspired action game that was well-recieved (here’s our review). Sea of Stars centers on two heroes who wield the power of the moon and the sun to battle an evil alchemist. You can watch the original reveal trailer below.",

In Pow Wow Entertainment's newly announced racer, Stuntfest: World Tour, I'm hoping the unique ejector-seat functionality is so jaw-droppingly incredible that it becomes the next craze. In the game's first trailer, we see drivers rocketing out of their cars to bounce off pads or ignite a jetpack's thrusters.\nStuntfest: World Tour is in development for PC with publishing duties handled by THQ Nordic sometime in 2022. We don't have many details yet, but a press release states that the player can assume the identity of a \"punker granny\" or a \"famous streamer\" with the hope of winning elimination-style stunt shows featuring 18 drivers. The competitions range from destruction derbies to glider racers. When the player hits the ejector button and their driver launches hundreds of meters into the air, they can be freely controlled and gadgets can be used to gain an edge. When descending, the next car you see can be yours to drive. Progress in the world tour rewards you with vehicle upgrades.\nStuntfest: World Tour has a hell of a hook, but it's difficult to figure out how these races will unfold. I can't wait to get my hands on this game to see if this unique gimmick (and the high levels of destruction) add up to something special.",

As EA notes, you cannot share your videos or screenshots from your play sessions.\nIf you are curious what Skate currently looks like or what you can expect from the gameplay, EA has released a trailer with the appropriate title \"Still working on it.\" The first few clips focus on bails, which must have been captured early in development given how rough the animations are. As the trailer moves on, the animations smooth out and the series' skating realism returns and is on display in a handful of awesome sequences. Full Circle also looks to be upping the scale of the challenges through some wild clips featuring impossible grind opportunities and huge ramps. Most of these clips are lack any kind of texturing or lighting and truly give us a look at how games are made.\nRegardless of where it is at in development, this trailer gives a fun look at a series that never should have left us.

Check out the short trailer below; it's as deliciously chaotic as you'd expect. \nThere was once a group of warriors who attempted to defeat the darkness.\n@FinalFantasy Origin's first expansion Trials of the Dragon King launches July 20th. pic.twitter.com/YvGEwGh1ux\nJune 30, 2022\nIn Stranger of Paradise fashion, it's hard to parse through what's happening in the footage, but we see Jack and co. cleaving their way through armored adversaries ranging from shield-holding knights to winged beasts with dazzling blades of their own. In one scene, a kingly figure sits upon a throne – is it safe to assume this is the Dragon King? – and says, \"You will die here, and I will live forever.\" We're sure Jack will make him eat his words. \nStranger of Paradise is as bizarre as Final Fantasy gets. Andrew Reiner gave the game a 7 out of 10 and concluded his review by saying, \"Stranger of Paradise is the strangest Final Fantasy game yet, bounding wildly between awful and fantastic. If you can tolerate Jack (and that's a big ask), the excellently crafted combat is worth a look. You may be coming to this game for the story and Final Fantasy experience, but it's all about combat and little else.\"\nStranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin's first DLC expansion, Trials of the Dragon King, drops on July 20 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.",

Join us on this fresh episode of New Gameplay Today as we check out the title's latest tank and show off the new map players can get their hands on later this year.\ncoverage here.\n\n\n\nThe Junker Queen is here, and she means business. The leader of the Junkers is more of an offensive tank than some of her other colleagues within the category. She comes strapped with a shotgun that maybe doesn't have the power of Roadhog's but has plenty of damage to dismantle the opposing team. She also comes equipped with a handy throwing knife that can cause quite the commotion. If players land a hit with an electrified weapon, enemy health drops over time. If she misses, the knife can still help as you can call it back, similar to the Leviathan Axe from God of War (2018), and actually pull enemies closer. Pair those abilities with her deadly charge up and a devastating ultimate attack, and she has a chance to really make some waves.\nOn top of a deep dive into Junker Queen and her moveset, we're also showing off the Push game type and Colleseo, a brand new map for Overwatch players to explore and dominate in. Is all this enough to get players to jump back into Overwatch? You'll just have to watch for yourself to find out!",

In fact, the series is going bigger. Much bigger!\n\n\nThe first trailer for Ultra Kaiju Monster Rancher asks a crucial question, \"How would you like to raise your very own Ultra Kaiju?\" To which I responded, \"Yes, please. I'd very much like that. Give it to me now.\" Foregoing the dull, average-sized creatures you used to raise in Monster Rancher, Ultra Kaiju Monster Rancher lets you take care of some colossal sweet boys. You'll raise the likes of Zettan, Gomora, and Alien Baltan – all licensed Kaiju from the Ultraman franchise. Many other existing Kaiju appear in the game, and you'll take them to help townsfolk in ways only a giant monster could. You can also participate in massive monster battles or watch the colossal beings waddle like big clumsy babies. As a fun bonus, the Kaiju can be bred, making wild combinations of their attributes appear in their children. It all seems like a lot of goofy fun.\nWe're not sure if Ultra Kaiju Monster Rancher is coming to North America, but it's slated to hit Japan and Southeast Asia this year. At the very least, a version will be translated into English for those looking to import.",
