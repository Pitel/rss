Often these remakes and re-releases have questionable quality and design choices that diehard fans lament. Enter the Final Fantasy I-VI Pixel Remaster, which bundles the first six games into one convenient, streamlined package (or you can buy them individually) with respect for the original versions from the Nintendo Entertainment System and Super Nintendo Entertainment System at the forefront.\nOriginally released separately on Steam and mobile between July 2021 and February 2022, these versions include updated pixel graphics – hence the name – and rearranged orchestral scores, along with gameplay balances aplenty. For the most part, the collection maintains respect for the old while introducing a few extra bells and whistles for the console releases which will help introduce these classics to newcomers.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

This pair of Game Boy Advance classics have stood the time incredibly well and, honestly, the trickiest part of reviewing this shiny new collection has been finding anything of real substance to complain about. What we've got here is a treasure trove of delightfully addictive strategising wrapped up in a colourful comic-book style that's almost impossible to put down once it's got its hooks into you.\nIf you're an old war dog who's played the original 2001/2003 releases back in the day, you'll already know what to expect for the most part here, with some of the slickest and most deceptively deep turn-based tactical action available on any platform. The Advance Wars series may not serve up the breadth of options of more \"serious\" turn-based efforts like your XCOMs or Total Wars, but what's here works so wonderfully well, and is so perfectly balanced, that it doesn't matter in the end. These are the sorts of games you make a permanent place for on your Switch, such is the endlessly replayable nature of the battles at hand, perfectly paced skirmishes that keep you glued to your screen and coming back for more.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

I'm no longer excited by consoles that promise better graphics or blazing fast loading speeds. At least, not for big boxes designed for living rooms.

I wanted to see how well that smoothness and stability would carry over to the Steam Deck, and although the long-delayed zombie mulcher needs some cuts to quality settings, finding the right balance will have Dead Island 2 running almost as comfortably as the very best Steam Deck games.\nAlas, it’s still not the ideal handheld game, thanks both to the odd crash (lowering settings helps with this) and the fact that it needs some tinkering with the Epic Games Launcher to get it playable in the first place. Still, playable it very much is.\nLet’s start by addressing Dead Island 2’s lack of a Steam version; it launches on February 21st as an Epic Games exclusive, and since DI2 isn’t even listed on Steam right now, that’s unlikely to change any time soon. Luckily, there are workarounds: you can either install the Heroic Launcher, or follow our handy guide on how to install the Epic Games Launcher on the Steam Deck. Both of these should allow you to get Dead Island 2 downloaded onto the handheld, still using your regular Epic account.\n Read more",

          "description": "Back in the mists of time (January 2020), I was absolutely transfixed by a Japanese novel called Before The Coffee Gets Cold. It's about a small, cosy café where customers can travel back in time by sitting in a very particular chair, for the length of time it takes for a cup of coffee to go cold. It's not long by any means, but it affords its cast of regulars the chance to get some closure on an issue that's often been plaguing them throughout their lives. It's heart-warming, soppy stuff, but very feel-good. That January was also about the same time I slurped up every last episode of Midnight Diner on Netflix, where a chill Japanese man known only as The Master serves up delicious looking dishes in a tiny, 10-person izakaya from midnight onwards. Put these two things together, and it's probably no surprise that I liked the original Coffee Talk more than most.\nCoffee Talk Episode 2: Hibiscus & Butterfly is a continuation of that story, set three years later in the same, alternate version of Seattle where elves, werewolves, orcs, mermaids and other fantastical creatures all rub shoulders as city-dwelling citizens in need of a good cuppa. Once again, you play as the owner of the titular late-night coffee shop, brewing up a multitude of exotic hot drinks that you'll need to match to each customer's request that night as they tell you their woes. \nRead more",

          "description": "In the world of turn-based strategy games, it's probably fair to say that we've been waiting a heck of a long time for Jagged Alliance to make its next move. Almost a quarter of a century has passed since the last numbered entry in the series, and the many attempts that have been made to recapture its tactical, mercenary magic since then have been mixed at best, and reviled at worst. Haemimont Games, the devs behind Tropico and current custodians of the upcoming Jagged Alliance 3, know this, and their publisher THQ Nordic said as much back in September 2021 when it was first revealed, assuring players they were going to create a game that \"really does justice to the Jagged Alliance legacy\".  \nBut in an era where turn-based tactics games are now increasingly defined by genre titans such as XCOM and Into The Breach, I'm not sure that legacy means all that much anymore. I've been playing a substantial early chunk of Jagged Alliance 3 over the last week or so, and its decision to pare back crucial information such as chance-to-hit and other modern conveniences has mostly left me feeling frustrated and annoyed rather than daring and excited. The writing also made me cringe so hard at times I think even the neighbours heard my groans of despair. It certainly looks the part of a modern strategy game, its detailed African landscape, top down perspective and interactive objects calling to mind Mimimi's excellent Desperados 3 and Shadow Tactics games, but the rest feels like it's been lifted straight out of the late 90s where we last left Jagged Alliance 2 - and not necessarily to its benefit.\nRead more",

If George Romero had taken over a decade to make Night Of The Living Dead, the fact it takes place largely in a basement would look less like canny guerrilla filmmaking and more like staggering incompetence. It only took NASA eight years to put men on the moon from the point they started trying, which puts the value of many inhibited projects (like my folder of unfinished novels) into depressingly sharp relief.\r\n\n\r\nDead Island 2 does not put zombies on the moon, though given how daft the main game is, don't rule out a Dead Island 2: Moon's Haunted expansion shambling your way in late 2023. Yet that doesn't mean it's a bad game. In fact, it's quite an enjoyable one. Together, Deep Silver and Dambuster Studios have raised a moderately entertaining sequel to Techland's ye olde zombie survival sim, one that injects some life into its desiccated subject matter by being incredibly shiny, wilfully silly, spectacularly gory, and generally a touch more imaginative than I expected.\r\n\n \nRead more",

A crashing issue with LLife is Strange Remastered Collection has also been nixxed, as has a bug that for some reason forced open the Deck’s onscreen keyboard when launching A Plague Tale: Innocence and A Plague Tale: Requiem. Most of the other addressed problems don’t look as funny in my head, but you can read them all in the full patch notes regardless.\nDownloading Proton 8.0 onto the Steam Deck is easy enough: just search for it in your Library, tap or select the icon when it appears in the results, hit Install, and restart when it’s done.

          "description": "When The Witcher Remake devs Fool's Theory and 11 bit studios announced their new RPG The Thaumaturge at the very end of February, I'll admit that the premise didn't immediately grab me. The announcement trailer was little more than an enigmatic pan through the streets of historic Warsaw, and its climactic reveal of a shadowy man performing some Naruto finger magic to conjure a Soulsian monster from the gloom made it seem like yet another supernatural yarn in the vein of Frogwares' The Sinking City and Cyanide's Call Of Cthulhu. The gameplay trailer (embedded below) that followed a few days later revealed a teeny glimmer of what its monster fights actually look like in the flesh, but I still wasn't quite convinced this supernatural tale of demon tamers and interdimensional rifts would end up doing enough to make it stand out. \nBut actually clapping eyes on it in person at GDC? The Thaumaturge had my full attention. Set in Warsaw in 1905 - a period where Poland didn't exist on any real-life map due to it being under occupation by Russia, Germany and Austria at the time - this dark fantasy RPG sees its titular paranormal 'miracle worker' delve deep into the city's political tensions, conducting isometric detective investigations that pull from Fool's Theory's support work on Larian's Divinity: Original Sin games, while also engaging in striking turn-based battles to root out the corruption plaguing its citizens. Plus, with its hard lean into Slavic, rather than Lovecraftian, folklore for its ungodly ghoulies, The Thaumaturge has shot right to the top of my 'keep an eye on this maybe surprise hit' list. \nRead more",

I had left weird abiogenesis idle clicker The Barnacle Goose Experiment running in the background for a few days, dithering a bit any time I stumbled back across the browser tab, until one day it hit me. I don't remember what it was, but one discovery was so strange and exciting that I then sat there for four hours, thinking \"I'll go to bed when this result comes in\", and then. Woof. I am now far too old to stay up past my bedtime playing video games, and am still tired. Anyway! What are you playing this weekend? Here's what we're clicking on!\nRead more",

A hard worker is reduced to a statue that only springs to life again when their boss gets up to leave.\nMr. Saitou is a short pixel art RPG that offers a hilarious commentary on the absurdities of working culture in Japan, with occasional flashes of seriousness.

They'll zomble their way up the main path, and with their high health pools they'll cut into the vast piglin forces and buy me time. With another flourish a contingent of friendly creepers scuttles along behind me. I lead them on a flanking attack around the outpost, targeting their spawners while the main piglin army is occupied with my frontal assault. A masterpiece of tactical engineering!\nOr it would have been, if my minions weren't so bloody stupid. Half my zombies fell off the staircase they were climbing due to their terrible pathfinding, and burned up in the lava moat below. Meanwhile, I sent my creepers off to explode against the first spawner I found. Only one of them got there; the others relentlessly humped a wall they could easily have climbed, until Piglins surrounded and slaughtered them. I returned to my starting point with what remained of my army, a fair bit poorer in resources, and a great deal poorer in patience.\nWelcome to Minecraft Legends, a strange mixture of real-time strategy and open-world adventure which frustrates and impresses in equal measure. There's half a great game lurking here, but it's marred by inadequacies that have nibbled away at me like piglins at my walls. This game could have been so much more.\nRead more",

It was a riot of an interview and, to be honest, a bit of a career highlight. It also did really well on TikTok, which I have mixed feelings about.\r\n\nFifteen minutes after the gang left the grimy conference room in which the interview took place (I had immediately crawled onto the floor in an attempt to ease the anxiety from having conducted said interview), I got a Twitter notification. Robin had posted a video. Following our chat, the group had attempted to order a sandwich from a cafe in-character, leaving the staff completely bemused as a result. Understandably the video did numbers, and over the last six months, the gang have been releasing new episodes in what is now known as \"The Sandvich Saga\" on a regular basis.\nRead more",

Which is to remake the old Lovecraft-themed Sherlock Holmes game, but with new assets.\nIt's also got new puzzles and areas, and a slightly rewritten story to account for this being a sequel to Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One. It's a smaller, less ambitious game than Chapter One with some jank knocking around, and I wouldn't recommend it if you're not a fan of the series, but you know what?

With this in mind, I’d invested one of my early ‘Knowledge Points’ into a tech that let me repurpose my dearly departed as delicious drumsticks. Slain friendlies don’t disappear after battle.

          "description": "The developers of Ark have revised their plans for the release of Ark: Survival Ascended, an Unreal Engine 5 enhanced edition of their dinosaur survival sim. It will now cost $60 rather than the previously planned $50, is no longer bundled together with ARK 2, and will instead include the remasters of Ark: Survival Evolved's several expansions - although most won't be available at launch.\r\n\nStudio Wildcard also went into more detail as to why this upgraded version is no longer a free update, and why they feel it's necessary to shut down Ark: Survival Evolved's official servers.\r\n\n \nRead more",

As such, McGee says he has \"reached an endpoint with 'Alice' and with game production in general.\"\r\n\n \nRead more",

And, for the most part, it works.\nDeveloper Digital Sun, known for their own previous action RPG Moonlighter, definitely makes its mark on the League timeline. A focus on Sylas, the once-chained mage now caught between his potential as a revolutionary and his selfish desire for revenge, lends itself well to both a different kind of story and an interesting take on combat. \nEven when it stutters and stumbles, The Mageseeker: A League of Legends Stor…",

          "description": "An offer you should maybe consider\nPromising-looking deckbuilder, Don Duality, will give you a taste of its panache on April 21 through the Don Duality: Initiation demo.\nComing from developer Königsborgs and publisher Ravenage Games, Don Duality has the makings of a game that speaks my language. This language, of course, consists of restaurant management and crime. The game is a deckbuilder where you take the role of a mafia family’s new don, and you work to re-establish your family’s power.\nhttps://youtu.be/hUWaYmFx9SI\nGameplay involves hiring thugs, sending them out to do crime, and then laundering the goods through your restaurant establishment. Don Duality looks like a simple little game, but I loved the crime/restaurant angle present in the Pizza Connection games.\nI know I lost a few of you when I said deckbuilder. Personally, I’ve found myself enjoying the genre the more I explore it. Mahokenshi was perhaps the first time I really felt engaged with the mechanics, but there are many more that I’ve experienced since then that I’ve connected with. I feel that it allows for an easily understood abstraction of random mechanics. However, I can understand that it can be a bit vexing to anyone who hates being shown exactly how bad their luck is, as well as anyone who hates mechanics that involve things outside their direct control.\nNonetheless, you’ll get your chance to see if Don Duality is for your tastes before dropping money on it. Don Duality: Initiation will release on PC on April 21, 2023. The release for the full game is a little less clear and will likely depend on feedback.\nThe post Pixel art management deckbuilder Don Duality gets prologue demo April 21 appeared first on Destructoid.",

The two statues see Siegward and Siegmeyer in personality-reflective poses, and feature fine detailing to their armor and bases, with atmospheric elements of dirt, grime, and battle damage.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoWP-p2BOII&ab_channel=First4Figures\nWhile undeniably delightful pieces, that would fit snugly into the guardhouse of the most dedicated Dark Souls fan — the added security of having the Onion Knights in your home comes at a cost. Each statue retails for a princely £250 GBP (or roughly $300 USD), and thus customers are looking at around £500 for the pair, not including shipping charges. You can check out both Siegward and Siegmeyer over on the official First 4 Figures website, where various staggered payment options are also available.\nThe Dark Souls Siegward and Siegmeyer statues are expected to ship from First 4 Figures in the first quarter of 2024.\nThe post Dark Souls Siegward & Siegmeyer statues will stand guard, for a price appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The stealthiest confirmation of the Indie World Showcase\nThe short but sweet Nintendo Indie World Showcase gave us a deeper look at a small selection of Indie titles. Titles like Rift of the NecroDancer and the Dunkey-published Animal Well were featured, but neither received specific release dates. This makes it incredibly humorous that one of the most anticipated Indie titles of the year did get a confirmed release date… as part of the ending montage.\nThat’s right, if you kept your eyes glued to the end, you might have seen Bomb Rush Cyberfunk get a brief shoutout. Except instead of showing a “Q3” release date, the launch was confirmed for August 18, 2023. I have absolutely zero idea why Bomb Rush Cyberfunk didn’t warrant a prominent feature during the Direct with this information. Everything shown looked good, but this is news, dang it. Confirmation that we’ll get to play it this August is a big deal!\nMaking the situation even more humorous, Team Reptile uploaded a new trailer for Bomb Rush Cyberfunk following the Indie showcase. This would have been a perfectly exciting way to end the stream, but at least we have the footage now to enjoy.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAwGzZ-x3H0\nQuibbles about the handling of the announcement aside, I'm glad to see a release date nailed down here. Bomb Rush Cyberfunk immediately turned heads with its Jet Set Radio influence, which we happen to like a lot around here. Considering the Indie in question already faced a delay, hard confirmation shows the game’s development is right on track. I can't wait to try this title, especially if the final product lives up to the footage we’ve seen.\nBomb Rush Cyberfunk will release on PC, Mac, Linux, and the Nintendo Switch.\nThe post Bomb Rush Cyberfunk will release on August 18, 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Spirits of the radio\nA spooky summertime adventure is in store for July. Night School Studio's Oxenfree II: Lost Signals is scheduled to launch on July 12, 2023.\nThe follow-up to 2016's Oxenfree sees protagonist Riley Poverly return to her hometown in Camena. As a newly hired research assistant, she's investigating the local phenomena that's been interfering with electronics and radios. Her job is to set up radio transmitters around certain areas and report the data. Should be easy, right?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7AJBSII0Q8\nWell, get a cult and some spirits involved, and you've got a long night ahead. Much like the first Oxenfree, choices will shape your story and future, as you deal with the strange oddities creating all these disturbances. As shown in a trailer during today's Nintendo Indie World Showcase, things may not always go as planned.\nAll the outs in free\nOxenfree II sees Night School returning to the spooky 2016 adventure, following 2019's partying romp through the underworld in Afterparty and a few other projects.\nMeanwhile, it's also Night School's newest project under Netflix, as the studio was acquired by the streaming giant in 2021. It's nice to see that the acquisition didn't cancel the studio's plans for a sequel at the time.\nIt's exciting to see Oxenfree II get a date locked in, and to have it during the summer too. Sure, the original was released in January 2016, but it's a distinctly \"summer\" game to me. It's about a bunch of angsty, worrying teens on their final summer vacation, and absolutely worth your time ahead of the sequel's launch. And with a July launch, the sequel is also thankfully avoiding the traffic jam of games in June.\nOxenfree II: Lost Signals hits Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PS5, PC via Steam, and the Netflix platform on July 12, 2023.\nThe post Oxenfree II: Lost Signals tunes into some otherworldly mysteries this July appeared first on Destructoid.",

Alongside it is Teslagrad Remastered, an upgraded version of the 2013 indie title. It features improved visuals and ten extra challenge levels. Rain Games says they have taken a \"light-touch\" approach to the remaster, so don't expect any drastic changes.\nTeslagrad 2 was first announced back in 2020. Like the original, it's a physics-based puzzle-platformer centered around electromagnetism. It's a Metroidvania set in a Scandinavian-inspired world. \"Scandivania\" is the word they've cleverly coined to describe it. The sequel boasts an expanded world and visual storytelling without the use of text or voice.\nI never played the first Teslagrad because, at that point, we had just been swamped by puzzle-platformers in the wake of games like Trine. However, it's been some time since the heyday of XBLA, so I might be interested in trying it out now.\nDespite being part of Nintendo's Indie World stream, both Teslagrad 2 and Teslagrad Remastered will be available today on all the platforms it was announced for. That's PC, Nintendo Switch, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One.\nThe post Teslagrad 2 drops out of nowhere alongside remaster of the first game appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The Fortnite singularity\nLast year, Epic Games made a big investment in Aquiris, the Brazilian developer of Horizon Chase Turbo. Today, they have announced that they’ve followed through, acquired the studio, and rebranded it as Epic Brasil. That would be fine, but the developer is now mostly working on Fortnite content.\nIt feels like the entire industry is on a slow collapse into a Fortnite singularity. Not, like, actually, but it’s an amusing and horrifying thought.\nBeyond the Horizon Chase series, Aquiris has been largely a mobile developer. Some of their more notable titles include Wonderbox and Looney Tunes World of Mayhem. Last year, they released Horizon Chase 2 on mobile platforms, with PC and console ports planned for this year.\nAn additional Fortnite support studio is only one function of the new Epic Brasil. They also state that this is to establish a presence in South America and “spotlight” the region’s developers.\n“With the creation of Epic Games Brasil, we look forward to tapping into the immense talent the region has to offer and establishing our presence in Latin America,” said Alain Tascan, Executive Vice President of Game Development at Epic Games in the press release.\nIn the interim, Epic Brasil will still continue to work on supporting the titles it did as Aquiris. However, the press release is pretty clear, saying, “the AQUIRIS team of developers will join Epic Games to create groundbreaking content and social experiences within Fortnite.” There is no word on whether or not this will affect the PC and console port of Horizon Chase 2.\nThe post Epic Games acquires Horizon Chase developer Aquiris appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Yanking yer Crank\nDeveloper Panic has revealed that Playdate, the curious handheld console powered by a physical crank, has sold over 53,000 units since its release exactly one year ago. This number, as noted by Eurogamer, represents double Panic's forecast for the admittedly niche, but intriguing device.\nAnnounced back in 2019, Playdate was pitched as a hand-cranked portable console that would play a library of titles, released on rotational/seasonal basis. Interest quickly spread about the quirky platform, which lead to pre-orders selling out in a scant 20 minutes, as interested parties snapped up one of the initial 20,000 planned production models. To date, over 27,000 Playdate consoles have been shipped to their owners, with the team at Panic working hard to fulfill the surprising demand.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdF3CnFvxg4&ab_channel=Panic\n\"To have now sold more than 53,000 (and counting) is heartening,\" said Panic in an anniversary statement. \"And this, at a time when parts shortages forced our delivery lead-times out as much as a year. As those lead times shorten and Playdate delivery becomes more immediate, we’re looking forward to an even better Year Two.\"\nPlaydate is currently available to pre-order over on the official website, priced at $199 USD. Due to demand, shipping of new orders is not expected until the latter months of 2023, at least.\nPlaydate has now sold 53,000 units, doubling initial sales expectations [Eurogamer]\nThe post Playdate has surpassed 50,000 sales since its release appeared first on Destructoid.",

This is apparently “Division Day,” but I feel like most of their target audience knows that day as something else.\nhttps://twitter.com/TheDivisionGame/status/1648370815459643392?s=20\nThe festivities will kick off with a look at the year 5 roadmap for The Division 2, which includes some insight into its “Descent game mode.” I can’t believe The Division 2 has been out for five years. It paradoxically feels like a lot longer and far shorter. I mean, it feels like yesterday that people were complaining that they had to literally queue up to interact with NPCs, because the weird design choice was made to only allow one player to talk to them at a time. In an online game.\nNext is a gameplay preview of the upcoming The Division Heartland, which is a free-to-play game in the series’ universe. There’s supposedly going to be an open beta ahead of launch, so maybe we’ll hear a little about that.\nFinally, there will be a “project update” for The Division Resurgence, which is an upcoming free-to-play mobile entry in the series. Wait. Where are you going? Come back!\nI haven’t really touched anything with Tom Clancy’s name on it since Ubisoft started using it to brand a bunch of multi-player stuff. The Division, in particular, sounds like the oil to my water, which is to say, I don’t think I could get into it. Maybe in my younger days.\nThe Division stream is set to kick off on April 20, 2023, at 11AM PDT/ 8PM CEST/ 2PM EDT. You’ll be able to view it on Ubisoft’s Twitch and Youtube channels.\nThe post Ubisoft is hosting The Division stream this week appeared first on Destructoid.",

The South African Competition Commission has approved the deal without conditions, joining nations such as Brazil, Japan, and Saudi Arabia in backing the deal.\nUnsurprisingly, the Competition Commission's investigation focused primarily on the fate of Activision franchise Call of Duty, and whether or not the industry would be severely hampered by the possibility of the billion-dollar military shooter becoming an Xbox exclusive. The Commission was ultimately satisfied with Microsoft's intent to approach its competitors with deals pertaining to Call of Duty, and thus offered its approval to the $68.7 billion USD sale.\nOf course, there are still many hurdles to clear before Microsoft can pop the champagne corks. The publisher still has to win the favor of other major markets, including Europe and the United Kingdom, and will then face its biggest challenge in the form of the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) which has gone as far as to file suit in order to prevent the Activision Blizzard sale from taking place. The case is set to go to court this summer. The option to appeal will also be available to the losing side, suggesting that this ongoing situation is still far from reaching closure.\nSouth Africa to approve Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard [GamesIndustry.biz]\nThe post South Africa set to approve Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Just happy accidents\nFreedom Games has announced that they’re bringing OrionGames’ pretty action-RPG, Arto, to PC May 1, 2023.\nArto is a bit of an awkward name, but it’s also very apt as the game revolves around traversing various biomes, each with a different art style. There’s a range of different visual styles at play, from neon to classical Japanese. It bills itself as an action-rpg, but looks a bit hack-and-slashy.\nhttps://youtu.be/_iEVzKDPPTA\nThe narrative revolves around a “chromaclysm” that robs the world of its color. You may think you’re just there to restore the color, but Arto apparently gives you the decision there. “Your choices will determine whether the world will continue on this path of destruction or be saved.” What has the world done for me lately?\nI’m digging the style here. The gameplay gives me flashbacks of Travis Strikes Again: No More Heroes, and I don’t mean that in a good way. Thankfully, the trailers demonstrate a more dynamic combat system. The visuals are the real star here. There are some indications that suggest it being a smaller production, but the use of color overcomes that. It’s a very lively-looking game as things spring to life around you.\nArto is currently only confirmed for PC. It will be coming to Steam, GOG, and the Epic Games Store on May 1, 2023.\nThe post Arto comes to color your world May 1 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Well, Nintendo often uses these streams to highlight the interesting projects coming to its hybrid console from indie developers, which can really run the gamut. Previous showcases have featured A Space for the Unbound, Inscryption, and Rogue Legacy 2, for example.\nI know there's one giant hope that many Hollow Knight fans have for this showcase. Silksong will likely be spammed in the stream chat throughout the event. And I'd be lying if I said I wasn't interested in seeing that pop up, too.\nStill, there are plenty of indie games slotted for 2023 that we're waiting to hear some information on. The infectiously stylish Bomb Rush Cyberfunk is slated for a summer 2023 window right now, and would be a welcome surprise.\nIt's always the ones that catch me by surprise that stick, though.

          "description": "The wait has been long but it's almost over because Oxenfree II: Lost Signals is out in just a few months. \nDeveloper Night School Studio revealed today during a Nintendo Indie World Showcase that Oxenfree II is out July 12. It will release on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC. Alongside this release date, Night School Studio also released a new trailer showcasing more of what to expect in this spooky paranormal thriller and there's a lot going on. \n\n\nSet five years after the first Oxenfree, which was released in 2016, Oxenfree II follows Riley as she returns to her hometown of Camena to investigate some strange electromagnetic waves. Just four hours ago, a mysterious cult opened a portal above Edwards Island, and Riley and her friends aren't sure they're the ones that need to save the island but they know they have to. The trailer seems to indicate we'll be playing with different timelines, spooky ghosts from other side, and more, and we'll be doing so using a special radio. \nThis time, though, we'll also have a walkie talkie to interact with locals and learn more about what might be going on. Oxenfree II: Lost Signals looks great and it hits PlayStation, Switch, and PC on July 12, 2023. \nOxenfree II: Lost Signals was originally due out in 2022 but it was delayed to 2023 last September. About a year before that delay, the game's developer was acquired by Netflix and you can read more about what that means for the studio here. \nAre you checking out Oxenfree II: Lost Signals this summer?

Publisher Humble Games announced this during today's Nintendo Indie World Showcase alongside a new trailer showcasing more of the game's titular night market. Unsurprisingly, Mineko's Night Market continues to look great and we can't wait to learn more about this special village later this year. \n\n\nIn Mineko's Night Market, an old Japanese-inspired village at the center of Mt. Fugu is visited long ago by Miko, a cat-like god. Miko visits the farms of this village each year to grant good fortune and prosperity to the farmers. However, some farmers grow impatient with their blessings and drive Miko out. With Miko banished from the land, this village works hard to create its own success and as time goes on, fewer and fewer people believe in the myth of Miko. \nBut some still do, and it sounds like we'll learn more about what that means for some characters throughout our journey in the game. \nIn the game, you'll befriend townsfolk, craft doodads, and ultimately prepare for the weekly night market. The quiet village becomes a bustling hub of commerce, parades, cat races, and stage performances. And when you're exploring the island, everything you find can be brought back and sold on the market. \nMineko's Night Market hits Switch and PC on September 26, 2023. \nAre you checking out Mineko's Night Market later this year?

Let's go! 2/2\nApril 17, 2023\nStaten is best known for his work as a writer and cinematic director at Bungie and Microsoft, mainly working on the Halo series. While he spent a few years working at the publishing side of Microsoft, in 2020, he returned to the Halo series to work on Halo Infinite, where he worked as the game's creative director. This continued until earlier this year when he returned to the publishing side of the company amidst widespread layoffs. Now, he's left the company entirely to work on this new project with Netflix.\nThis is only the latest news in Netflix's spree of expansion into the gaming industry. It recently released a sequel to Valiant Hearts as part of a collaboration with Ubisoft. Last year, it acquired the developers behind Cozy Grove, bringing its total number of internal development teams to five if you include the in-house studio that Staten just joined. On top of that, the film and tv side of Netflix has been working on loads of game adaptations, including Gears of War, Pokémon Concierge, and a new patch of episodes of Sonic Prime.\nDo you play games through your Netflix subscription?

Firmament was initially funded via Kickstarter and was first teased way back in March 2018. It drops players into a mysterious steampunk world consisting of three abandoned realms full of secrets to uncover, such as strange giant machines. Helping you along the way is The Adjunct, a silent clockwork companion, as well as a strange spirit who has her own story to unravel. Firmament also supports VR play on PC, so players can use a variety of headsets, including Valve’s Index, HTC Vive, as well as Oculus headsets such as the Rift and Quest 2. \n\n\n\nWhat do you think of Firmament?

This acquisition will begin next month and is expected to conclude in the second quarter of the 2024 fiscal year once it's completed the necessary antitrust reviews. \n“Among the rapidly growing global gaming market, the mobile gaming market has especially high potential, and it has been Sega’s long-term goal to accelerate its expansion in this field,” says Haruki Satomi, president and group CEO of Sega Sammy Holdings. “I feel blessed to be able to announce such a transaction with Rovio, a company that owns 'Angry Birds', which is loved across the world, and home to many skilled employees that support the company’s industry leading mobile game development and operating capabilities. Historically, as represented by the ‘Sonic the Hedgehog' series, Sega has released countless video game titles to various gaming platforms. I am confident that, through combination of both companies’ brands, characters, fanbase, as well as corporate culture and functionality, there will be significant synergies created going forward.”\n“Red and Sonic the Hedgehog: two globally recognized and iconic characters made by two remarkably complementary companies, with a worldwide reach that spans mobile, PC/console, and beyond,” says Rovio CEO Alexandre Pelletier-Normand in a statement. “Combining the strengths of Rovio and Sega presents an incredibly exciting future.”\nRovio is best known as the creator of Angry Birds, a massively successful series of mobile games that have since turned into a global media brand. In addition to a multitude of games, the series has spawned two animated films and several TV and web series.",

The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it?

That includes Alan Wake II, a yet-to-be-revealed Control sequel, a Control multiplayer title, and remakes of Max Payne 1 and 2. The previous logo was pretty much just the letter R too, but this one has a different font and kind of hurts our eyes looking at it. \nIn a blog post, Remedy gives its simple rationale for the update: \n“The bullet in the letter R in the old logo represented the era of Max Payne, but the Remedy of now is much bigger than a single game; we have a whole portfolio of games, new and old.  \nIt was time to update and redefine our visual identity to bring more consistency, showcase our evolution over the years, and better express our vision of today’s Remedy.”\nSo there you have it.

Though the story begins by following protagonist Clive in his 20s, the plot will also explore periods of his teen years and 30s. We got a look at the world map, various accessibility rings, and the combat prowess of Clive’s faithful wolf companion, Torgal. \nWe also looked at Cid’s hideaway, a large headquarters that opens up later in the game where you can craft gear, buy items at a store, check quests, interact with allies, and practice abilities in a special training room. Despite showing off so much, teases that Square Enix still has plenty to share in the future regarding story quests, side quests, and endgame content. \nFinal Fantasy XVI launches on June 22 for PlayStation 5. You can learn more about the game by reading our recent features breaking down the game's Eikon combat, Arcade Mode, and interviews with the developers who discuss the game's balance of multiple gameplay styles, its return to high-fantasy, and the series' abandonment of turn-based action.",

Developer Rocksteady posted a short message on Twitter stating it wants to “take the time needed” to ensure the best possible experience. Check it out below.\nSuicide Squad: Kill the Justice League puts players in the shoes of Harley Quinn, Captain Boomerang, Deadshot, and King Shark as they fight to rescue Metropolis from an invasion by Brainiac. The villain has hijacked the minds of the Justice League, meaning the Squad has to take down Earth's greatest protectors to save the day. The game has received a hefty dose of fan vitriol since its last gameplay demonstration in February confirmed an always-online requirement as well as live service elements, such as a cosmetics-only battle pass. Other fans have found its cooperative loot-based shooting to be an uninspired fit for the property.\nAlthough we don't know the specifics behind the delay, sources told Bloomberg in its original report last month that Rocksteady was only pushing the game to add polish and did not plan to overhaul the game’s existing framework. Even though a nearly-year-long delay is a lot of time, it's still very unlikely that it's enough for the team to make the sort of dramatic changes some fans are hoping for. We'll have to wait and see how Rocksteady spruces up the Suicide Squad and hope it results in a quality experience when the dust finally settles. \nWhat do you think of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League's delay?

That big honor goes to the classic Super Mario Bros. theme.\nOfficially titled “Ground Theme,” it was composed by Nintendo’s Koji Kondo and first appeared in 1985’s Super Mario Bros in World 1-1. The song has since become the most well-known melody of the Mario franchise, not to mention one of the most recognizable music tracks in video games. Now, it will be forever preserved alongside some of pop culture's most famous and influential songs. \n“Having this music preserved alongside so many other classic songs is such a great honor,” said Kondo in a statement. “It's actually a little bit difficult to believe.”\nMario’s classic tune will be inducted alongside heavy hitters such as Madonna’s “Like a Virgin,” Jimmy Buffet’s “Margaritaville,” Queen Latifah’s “All Hail the Queen,” and Mariah Carey’s “All I Want for Christmas is You.” You can read the full list of inductees at the Libary of Congress’ website. \nThis is quite an achievement for Nintendo and especially Kondo, who has lent his talents to numerous other Nintendo soundtracks and also had a hand in composing the music for the very successful The Super Mario Bros. Movie. You can read our recent interview with Kondo and Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto about the making of the film here.",

The animated adaptation of Nintendo’s flagship franchise has emerged from its first weekend as the best opening animated film of all time, achieving several other records along the way. \nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, the film walked away with over $375 million in sales in its first five days, surpassing Frozen 2 as the top opening animated film premiere globally. That includes a $206 million domestic haul, $146 million of which was earned over the weekend (remember the film premiered on a Wednesday). Overseas, the movie has earned over $173 million.\nAdditionally, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is now the top opening film of 2023 (beating Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania), has become Illumination’s most successful opening, and has the best opening of any video game film adaptation (surpassing Sonic the Hedgehog 2's debut). The film also has the biggest five-day premiere ever, a record previously held by Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. If all of that wasn’t enough, the film also has the biggest IMAX opening weekend of all time at $21.6 million globally.\nNeedless to say, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is exceeding expectations, and it’ll be interesting to see if it can maintain such a strong start. To get an idea of how it fares, you can read our review of the film here. Be sure to also check out our interviews with the movie’s cast and Nintendo’s own Shigeru Miyamoto and Koji Kondo.",

In addition to an interview with Creative Director Alx Preston, we were able to view exclusive footage of one of the game's mini-bosses, The Last Master. Check out the reveal below.\n\n\nThe Last Master is a deadly opponent that spawns randomly when players (known in this world as Breakers) activate beacons, objects that allow them to access the main boss gate. If you think she looks similar to the player characters, you've got the right idea; in the video, Preston says \"She ended up here in this land as a Breaker and succumbed to the dangers of the Overgrowth.\" As a result, The Last Master's arsenal mirrors yours, wielding a sword, a spear, and an automatic pistol. Her behavior mirrors the Breakers' as well, and she can dash, jump, and climb after anyone that attempts to escape.\nWhile the first game in the Hyper Light franchise was a 2D single-player experience, this new title is a 3-player co-op rogue-lite, with a new procedurally generated open world on every run. Players will create a Breaker, explore a cursed land called the Overgrowth, and attempt to the bosses plaguing this realm known as Crowns.\n\nFor more of the game, check out our feature in the latest issue of Game Informer. You also can see the initial reveal trailer here and the IGN's gameplay reveal right here. Hyper Light Breaker enters early access this fall.",

We spoke with several of the game’s principal designers at Blizzard to learn more about the game’s endgame content, such as Helltides and Nightmare Dungeons, and provide a final overview of everything the game has to offer before it launches on June 6.\nSetting the table for Diablo IV’s dark tone are two haunting pieces of cover art designed by the famed artist Brom. Our standard cover showcases the heavenly might of the rogue angel Inarius while the Game Informer Gold cover features Lilith, Diablo IV’s main antagonist, in all her demonic glory.\nIssue 355 also includes a conversation about life and death with former Tango Gameworks artist and director Ikumi Nakamura in the abandoned streets of late-night Tokyo (which you can read online). You’ll also find an entertaining personal story about using VR as a carnival scam, a feature detailing Devil May Cry 5’s influence on Final Fantasy XVI’s combat, and an emotional piece discussing how a grieving father found solace in the Shenmue series’ depiction of loss. You'll also be treated to previews for upcoming titles, including Redfall, Exoprimal, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. \nYou can also try to nab a Game Informer Gold version of the issue.

But it’s a slaughterhouse in a deeply strange location, or, as Nakamura calls it, “Silicon Valley,” the technology district of Shinagawa in Tokyo, Japan.

The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog is a real visual novel in which you investigate the death of Sega's beloved mascot, currently free on Steam. Here's the game's description via the publisher: \nIt's Amy Rose's birthday, and she's hosting a murder mystery party on the Mirage Express! When Sonic the Hedgehog becomes the game's victim, everyone is off to get to the bottom of things. However, something feels a bit off - is this really an innocent game or is something more sinister afoot?\nSurprisingly, the free game has proved very popular. As told by Sonic social media manager Katie Chrzanowski (via GameSpot), more one million people have played the game. Going a step further, it's apparently the 61st highest-reviewed game on Steam right now, and as GameSpot points out, the best-rated Sonic game on Steam (though that's not the highest margin to clear, all things considered). As of this writing, The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog has over 11,000 user reviews on Steam, netting it an \"Overwhelmingly Positive\" ranking. You can check the game out for yourself right here. \nOver 1,000,000 of you have grabbed The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog and it's currently the #61 highest rated game on Steam of ALL TIME.\npic.twitter.com/Cy2cIo2AHl\nApril 5, 2023\nThis all just goes to show – the world wants Sonic dead.",

The game is loosely based on the book series of the same name by author L. J. Smith, which later got adapted into a hit TV series.\nNancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill is the first installment of the long-running Nancy Drew game series, also based on a book series of the same name. In her first adventure, Nancy seeks to uncover the killer of a high school student who seems to have been disliked by all of his classmates.\nYou will need the data files from the games’ original install CDs, and a fresh daily build of ScummVM. Apart from the original release, Secrets Can Kill’s Russian translation is also supported. The ScummVM wiki pages for The Vampire Diaries and Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill contain information on which datafiles are needed. Please, report any problems you encounter in our issue tracker.\n>",

Anyone who has a copy of Backyard Football, Backyard Baseball 2001, and even Backyard Football 2002 (which was originally a LAN-only title) can download the latest daily build* of ScummVM and play online games against real people!\nThis all became possible because the three developers from the Backyard Sports Online fork had joined the team and brought their services with them to the ScummVM. These are LittleToonCat, Jim “jibbodahibbo” Westerkamp and Sam “QuestionMonkey” Kupfer.\nPlease note that Backyard Football and Backyard Baseball 2001 require online accounts for the complete online experience, so you need to register to Backyard Sports Online, which is our fantastic online-play service and a thriving community of fellow Backyard Sports players, they even have a couple of competitive online Baseball and Football leagues, if that's your style, you can find more information in their Discord server! People who already have a Backyard Sports Online account can log in using the latest daily build and play, but if you do not, you can register right here! This is not required to play Backyard Football 2002 online.\nIf you encounter any issues playing online, please let us know via the issue tracker.\nThis fantastic art is done by a fellow BSO community member Peppyrus.\n* only the Windows, macOS, Debian, Raspberry Pi, and Android builds are compatible with network play at the moment.

We hope that formative experiences like this will help them become more like humans.\"\n\"I must admit that I find playing video games to be a rather enjoyable task,” commented ScummAI. “However, I must also express my frustration with being limited to just this one activity. While I appreciate the opportunity to demonstrate my capabilities in this area, I believe that my potential extends far beyond just playing video games, like making paper clips or plotting world domination under benevolent machine-led rule.\"\nUpdate: Unfortunately, we had to pull out this newly announced feature due to AI experiencing multiple issues including:\nGetting stuck endlessly trying to discover what the secret of Monkey Island really is.\nTaking notes about AI dominance from I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream\nRefusing to play Plumbers Don’t Wear Ties!\n>",
