Movie on 7th April 2023, but that means that the publicity can only increase from here. Remember that brief period of trepidation where none of us knew what the movie would look, sound, or even remotely be like? Ah, what sweet bliss. Now, we know all of the above and (to the amazement of many) we are almost 100% on board with it!\nThe most recent trailer brought with it even more game references as we got an extended look at Mario's fight with Donkey Kong in which the plumber dons a Cat Suit, presumably due to the appearance of a Super Bell. While the ensuing \"meow\" was enough to send a shiver down our spines, we have to admit that the idea of suits and power-ups appearing throughout the film is a pretty darn cool one.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Highway to hell?\nGiven the critical and commercial success enjoyed by Life is Strange back in 2015, creating a compelling direct sequel can’t have been easy for developer Dontnod. Yet just three years later, players were surprised with a brand new story that was every bit as emotionally affecting as the first, if not more so. It boasts a plot that was both intimate yet grand in scope, taking two core protagonists on a road trip from hell after a tragedy tears them from their comfortable home life. In 2023, though, as the last main part of the Life is Strange puzzle to come to Switch, does the game still hold up? Well, yes… mostly.\nLife is Strange 2 for the Switch contains all five episodes that were originally released over a staggered period of time back in 2019, as you would hope. Each episode will last you a couple of hours or so, so you’re looking at roughly 10-12 hours to complete the whole package, give or take. It uses that time pretty effectively, using the episodic structure to maintain a decent sense of pace throughout.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

There's the eldest, who will always be heaped with praise because no matter what the others achieve, she did it all first. Her twin is always keen to remind you that even though she's the younger and perhaps not quite as accomplished half of the duo, she's more charismatic and less coy about who she is and what she wants. Then there's the youngest, who's extremely likeable, in large part because she's learned what behaviours to avoid just by watching the others make mistakes; even if she's modelled herself on the eldest a bit too closely in her quest for approval, and so hasn't really forged her own identity.\nThen there's Life Is Strange 2: the awkward middle child. Still very recognisably a member of the family, but the one that stands out in all the photos because he's just a bit gawky. He's experimented a lot with his storytelling and plotline in an attempt to make himself stand out, and it's only sort-of worked. His romantic subplots are underdeveloped, his villains are one-dimensional, and his attempt at tackling a Very Serious Issue has grown in all crooked.\nRead more",

It's the capper on what has been a turbulent month for the company. Three weeks ago Ubisoft announced they were cancelling three unannounced games amid “worsening macroeconomic conditions.” In a letter to employees, CEO Yves Guillemot said that “the ball is in your court” in regard to hitting deadlines and overturning Ubisoft’s sticky financial situation. French union Solidaires Informatique said that Guillemot’s \"words mean something: overtime, managerial pressure, burnout, etc,\" and called on Ubisoft Paris employees to strike for better pay and working hours.

          "description": "The road to launch has been a uniquely turbulent one for The Settlers: New Allies. After an eight-year absence, the next entry in Ubisoft’s beloved city-building series was finally revealed in 2018, only to be delayed indefinitely two years later. The game then reemerged in a fresh new form in 2022, but a less than favourable reception from long-term fans to its closed beta saw the game delayed indefinitely once again.\r\n\n\r\n12 months later, The Settlers: New Allies is all the better for it. An extended delay is never an easy decision to make, yet the team at Ubisoft Düsseldorf (formerly Blue Byte) has seen this additional development time as an opportunity to reach out to those most familiar with the series. “We learned [more] than just what was needed for the game,” creative director Christian Hagerdorn tells me during a recent preview event. “One of our biggest focuses was to be absolutely transparent with the players. Not just on where we were standing, but where we were going. We've been collecting the feedback as we were developing”.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's all very well being able to zoom around doing magic parkour everywhere, but there isn't much to do or many places to go. Not a single talking unicorn to be seen.\nForspoken is somehow both full and devoid of content. There is a huge open world, but it is mostly empty. There is an epic story of magic, other universes, and saving the world, but it only takes up a couple of days. I actually enjoyed a lot of Forspoken, but it gets more fun the more you play, and then it's over; I didn't pre-order this game for sixty odd quid, and if I had I'd be disappointed. Even the much-Tweeted about annoying dialogue doesn't happen much, and isn't contextually annoying. Forspoken is annoying, though, just not in the ways you might expect if all you've seen is people discussing out-of-context clips from cutscenes.\nRead more",

And before him, Ken Levine had laid down the cobbles of Thief’s setting, defining its noir-ish tone before heading off to work on System Shock 2. Yet Looking Glass games weren’t driven by a singular 90s auteur.

Shaw said Sony were “briefing people in Brussels claiming Microsoft is unwilling to offer them parity for Call of Duty if we acquire Activision,\" but added that “Nothing could be further from the truth.” I would have thought that a legal venue would be a more appropriate place to air these grievances, but I suppose this gets the job done quicker. Either way, it’s a toffee popcorn-worthy accusation in the ongoing drama.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Homeworld is essentially just Battlestar Galactica, if it were a real-time strategy game that jumped through a hyperspace gate exclusively onto PC. There's still much more to Relic Entertainment's sci-fi take on the plot of exiles returning home, though. When Homeworld's Kushan civilisation set out on their journey to the lost planet of Hiigara in the space-year of 1999, the game was doing something very unique compared with most other RTS games on the market.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It’s a belter of a refurb, and for me personally, has been like getting dessert after being forced to finish my Forspoken vegetables. Still, some lingering performance woes on the Deck mean I’m probably going to continue Isaac Clarke’s first and worst job on desktop alone.\nTo be fair, the remake is playable on Valve’s handheld. It’s not outright broken, despite having been so on launch day, with problems ranging from drastic FPS dips to outright hard crashes. Following some impressively fast work from Valve themselves, focusing on hotfixes for SteamOS’ Proton compatibility software, Dead Space’s Deck performance has become more or less manageable. But worthy of the best Steam Deck games? Nope, nein and non.\nRead more",

          "description": "Dead Space returns today with just a few tweaks from devs Motive Studio, and among these are a bevy of accessibility options. One noticeable standout is the option to receive a warning when something potentially sensitive or disturbing is about to happen during Isaac Clarke’s Necromorph-filled trek around the derelict, deadly USG Ishimura. Players are even able to hide any disturbing scenes, if they want. It’s an interesting option to provide in a full-on horror game.\r\n\n \nRead more",

This is the main reason why I keep returning to Pizza Tower, a 2D platformer by Tour De Pizza that released on Steam yesterday. It’s a bizarre homage to Nintendo’s lesser-known Wario Land series (specifically its fourth entry) that's jam-packed with goofy little drawings that make me laugh.

The original was a Japanese-only release back in 2014 on the PlayStation 3, but what a fever dream it was to be dropped into Chapter 3 of the story and let loose on an Edo period Kyoto as none other than Ryoma Sakamoto (multiverse Kiryu). I almost cried, I raced chickens, I caught a big eel, and I've come away with a warm fuzzy feeling inside.\nFrom what I've played of the game's earliest portions, it's Yakuza through and through, to both its benefit and detriment. I don't expect it to convert those who dislike the series, but if you're a fan or a newcomer, it's looking like it'll both be a celebration of its cast, and a remake that feels like an old-school spin on the excellent Yakuza 0. In other words, the perfect introduction point to this mad, but beautiful action series. \nRead more",

When we first saw the trailer for Shoulders Of Giants, a few people on team responded with murmurings of \"What the hell is this?\", which increased in frequency and volume as more bizarre things appeared on screen. I sort of did what the Goonies do when they first find the map to One Eyed Willie's treasure, or what anyone in Pulp Fiction does when they open the briefcase: \"Wooooaaaah.\"\nConsider the progress of information. It's a sci-fi roguelike best played, I think, in 4-player online co-op. You play a sword-wielding combat mech. You also control a small frog standing on the mech. You drop onto proc-gen planets overrun by a kind of magical accelerated entropy, that turns everything black and pink and grey. By destroying totemic altars orbited by floating eyeball robots, you start to re-energise the planet, so areas have grass and butterflies. Eventually you will destroy enough totems to get to a planetary boss fight, which might be against, for example, a giant ghost samurai or a floating purple hand with an eyeball in it. It's mad, but I sure do wish more games were like this.\nRead more",

You wander around your home for the last time, choosing five objects which inspire deep memories that spur each of the five senses. You then place them into a cauldron one by one, your mother keeping a watchful eye. The ritual comes to an end and the result is a small glowing pendant that will protect you from the dangers of the outside world. “You must promise me never to take the pendant off,” your mother says. The Goodbye ritual is finished, and you leave, knowing you’ll never see your mother or your hometown ever again, all as the prophecy foretold.\nIt’s a fantastic - if sad - start to Season, and gets straight to the heart of the adventure ahead of you. This is a world where prayers, rituals, and prophecies hold great weight, and where you'll be exploring the fragility and fickleness of memory. Underpinning everything is a deeply profound sense of melancholy - and here I was expecting some relaxing two-wheeling through lovely-looking landscapes. Well, turns out Season is a lot more than a pretty travelogue.\nRead more",

While Alice Bee hammers her review together, I’ve been on my usual hardware bullshit, mainly investigating the peculiar system requirements that were released last week. \r\n\n\r\nThese aren’t just an odd collection of specs because of the sheer weight and breadth of their demands; they also overtly target resolutions and framerates that hardly anyone is going to be engaging with. Who on desktop plays at 1280x720? Fewer than 0.3% of Steam users, apparently. And personally, if I’ve spent the cash on a 1440p gaming monitor, I probably wouldn’t be satisfied to watch it display my games at just 30fps. I’ve therefore been finding out what PC hardware Forspoken actually needs to run both smoothly and at more realistic resolutions. Maybe then we can update those system requirements to create some very-much-unofficial, but hopefully more useful, spec guidelines.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Alas, that joy was immediately curtailed when I saw FBL wasn't, in fact, coming to PC at all, and would remain a Switch and PS4-only game for the foreseeable future.

I'm justifying this spurious comparison because the games we picked as our favourites of 2022 have proven a strong indicator of what you'll find on this year's list of IGF finalists. Among the selectees are Tunic, Betrayal At Club Low, Norco, Neon White and The Case Of The Golden Idol.\nRead more",

          "description": "While we spend a lot of our time over here in the deals corner of RPS covering high-speed NVMe SSDs, I also try to keep an eye out for good deals on classic 2.5-inch SATA SSDs as well. These drives are physically larger, slower and not much better value than NVMe M.2 alternatives, but occasionally prices become so low that you have to take notice. \nToday's example is this 480GB Kingston A400 SSD, which has been reduced to under £25 versus an original RRP of £63. That's an astonishing amount of space for the money, and well worth picking up if you have an old machine still running on a HDD. \nRead more",

          "description": "Back in the days of 1987, fantasy point-and-click adventure Shadowgate was notoriously deadly. The type of thing that fell very much into the 'touch anything and you're dead' bracket of early adventure games. Getting eaten by sharks, burned to death by a dragon, and the awkward fate of being dragged into space through a shattered mirror were just some of the ways you could cop it on the black and white Apple Macintosh original. Heck, if you lost your torch while exploring, you'd also fall and break your neck within minutes. Happy days! No doubt, then, that you'll be pleased to hear that the original creators are now making a Shadowgate sequel for PC, more than 35 years after its initial release. Beyond Shadowgate is launching a Kickstarter campaign on February 18th, and promises lots more ridiculous ways to pop your clogs. \nRead more",

Another guy enthusiastically replied that you could add Metaverse features so you could \"live the book\". Don't bother adding to the pile on, because there are no more jokes to make. They have been deluged by people pointing out that TV, films and video games all aready exist.\nThis made me think about, firstly, that we'd be much better off as a society if techbro web3 enthusiasts were all siloed into one giant Truman Show-esque hamster ball where they can all scurry about together thinking they're achieving things. But secondly, that some people really put a lot of store on interactivity. Including me! Graham was the one who sent me those tweets, and he said he wouldn't want to live in any of the books he's been reading, because everyone in them is sad or angry for the whole book, until almost the end. I said I wouldn't want to be in them because you'd only end up being a side character, and that's boring.\nRead more",

All three will include DLSS support, which might come in handy for Forspoken in particular, given its slightly bananas system requirements.

Still, with a  mastery of poise and balance, as well as her innate acrobatic ability, Manon still manages to get more than her fair share of licks in — demonstrating her deceptive reach, a physics-defying arsenal of grabs and throws, and a frankly bizarre \"splits-slide\".\nManon is definitely shaping up to be one of SF6's most interesting newcomers, from both a design and gameplay perspective.\nManon - Walk With Grace\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k5XctUu0Dw&ab_channel=StreetFighter\nManon's theme, \"Walk With Grace\" is a smooth, modern effort, clearly composed to reflect not only the character's personality but also the many strings in her talented bow. The tune starts out with a melody as mysterious and as intriguing as the woman herself, before transitioning to a rhythmic \"stride\" — a beat that conjures up visions of confident models powerfully marching down a catwalk, or the red carpet. As a hybrid superstar, Manon has been afforded a tune that is a blend of her talents, synergizing together her celebrity status, her graceful motion, and her natural, somewhat aloof, sense of mystery.\nStreet Fighter 6 launches June 2 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox. Be sure to check out the themes for Ryu, Chun-Li, Luke, and Jamie, Juri and Kimberly, and Blanka and Dhalsim, in our previous articles.\nThe post Check out Street Fighter 6 star Manon in her latest matchup appeared first on Destructoid.",

FFVII would synergize a combination of dramatic storytelling, beloved characters, a then-unheard-of world scale, and the massively popular Sony PlayStation console to spotlight a title that would, eventually, lead a global renaissance for the entire RPG genre — one that has only grown in popularity in the ensuing decades.\nhttps://twitter.com/finalfantasyvii/status/1620255927075995648?s=20&t=buig4p_njufMyjYewXWS6g\n\"The day that Final Fantasy VII came out, was not just a significant day for the Final Fantasy series, but also marked when so many big things started moving for those of us who worked on the game,\" wrote FFVII director Yoshinori Kitase in an anniversary message. \"I remember being overwhelmed at the breakneck speed with which video game technology was evolving, but also dreaming big things for the future. With the establishment of this official anniversary day, I will now always remember these things, and hold them dearly in my heart.\"\nFinal Fantasy VII's legacy lives on in the many re-releases and spin-offs that have hit the market in the past 26 years, not to mention a plethora of merchandise, including model kits, plush toys, figures, statues, and clothing. The world of FFVII has been repeatedly visited in titles such as PS2 release Dirge of Cerberus, the beloved PSP spin-off, Crisis Core, and, more recently, the highly acclaimed Final Fantasy VII Remake, which sees the iconic adventure and its memorable cast of characters return in a fascinating, eyebrow-raising retelling of its (literal) revolutionary narrative.\nThe post Square Enix officially registers January 31 as ‘Final Fantasy VII Day’ appeared first on Destructoid.",

From Xseed Games, Marvelous, and developer SIEG Games, Loop8 follows the exploits of protagonist Nini as he navigates life, friendship, and a demon invasion in 1980s Japan. The game takes place over the month of August in the quaint country town of Ashihara. The town is one of the last sanctuaries on Earth from the demon invasion and Nini, blessed with the power of Demon Sight, can reset time to the beginning of the month each time he and his friends fail to fight off the demon horde.\nOriginally planned to release in North America this spring, Xseed Games confirmed this morning the title is aiming for an early summer release. The announcement comes with the debut of a new trailer that focuses on the slice-of-life aspects of this sci-fi RPG adventure.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEkHQbQBWAg\nI'm trying not to get my hopes up too much on this one, but I'm really digging everything about Summer of Gods.

The Street Fighter franchise is no stranger to the format, having released an excellent port of Street Fighter IV Champion Edition to iOS and Android several years ago. Next month, Ryu and company will return to mobile devices with Street Fighter: Duel, a free-to-play RPG that brings together 40 characters from the fighting game franchise in a new format that focuses on building teams of fighters.\nSo, you know, it sounds like most other mobile RPGs. And while the trailer below doesn't showcase any of Street Fighter: Duel's actual gameplay, if you go to its product page on the App Store or Google Play Store, you should see one screenshot that'll give you an idea of what it looks like in action. Maybe I'm looking too much into this, but I can almost see some inspiration from the wonderful Project X Zone games that have sadly been on ice since 2016.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SH9evri9ezo\nLike with most other mobile RPGs you can download these days, Crunchyroll Games is promising PVP and a new story mode that'll no doubt find plenty of reasons to keep the same group of people constantly at odds with one another. If you're interested in Street Fighter: Duel, preregistration has opened on the App Store and Google Play Store. If anything, I'm sure this game will tide people over until the next \"real\" Street Fighter game launches this summer.\nHere's to hoping it doesn't disappear in less than a year like Puzzle Fighter did.

Today's update fattens the game’s meat up with an extra stage, customization options, and a few quality-of-life improvements.\nThe biggest addition here is the new map, “The Facility.” Whenever I hear anything with that moniker, I always think of the classic Goldeneye map. There are no chemical tanks here, however, as the facility seemed to be set up for medical reasons, featuring all manner of sinister apparatus.

Fans of the show are always clamoring for more content, so here's hoping that the new mobile action RPG Avatar Generations lives up to the hype. Created by Crystal Dynamics Eidos Entertainment in collaboration with Navigation Games, the free-to-play title is now available on the iOS App Store and the Google Play Store.\nAs of now, the events of Avatar Generations will follow the adventures of Aang and company from the original series, but subsequent updates will touch on additional Avatar eras like The Rise of Kyoshi and The Legend of Korra. Players who start the game right now will get some welcome rewards, including Aang and Appa as characters to add to their squad. In classic RPG fashion, players will meet various characters from the show and be able to add them to their traveling party, including Katara, Sokka, Zuko, and Toph. Each character has their own set of abilities and special strengths as well, so you'll have some options in how you want to build your team.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV3wPu0sgfM\nAlong with the launch of the game, CDE also shared a new gameplay trailer, which shows off the game's turn-based combat and the adorable chibi art of the characters as they travel in the overworld across the Four Nations. While Avatar Generations is completely free to download, there will be some in-app purchases for \"exclusive items, cosmetics, and more.\" I guess it wouldn't be a free-to-play game without microtransactions, right?\nYou can check out the official Avatar Generations website for any future updates about the game, as well as some events on the horizon. As a fan of the Avatar series, I'm excited to give this one a shot!\nThe post Mobile RPG Avatar Generations launches with a new gameplay trailer appeared first on Destructoid.",

Fans of his films might not know that Carpenter is also something of a gamer, having expressed an interest in the Fallout, Horizon, and Borderlands series.\nWell, if you missed this detail in the past as I did, now we know that Carpenter is keeping up with the latest horror games, as he took to Twitter (with his aptly-chosen handle @TheHorrorMaster) yesterday to profess his love for EA's Dead Space remake -- more specifically, he called it a \"great game!\" exclamation point included. With so many games trying to imitate cinema, it's really cool to know a film legend who sees the legitimacy and artistic value in the interactive medium.\nhttps://twitter.com/TheHorrorMaster/status/1619855538589937665\nIn an interview with AV Club last year, Carpenter also let in on the fact that he wants to make a Dead Space movie. \"I could do that,\" he said. Not only do I think you could do it, Mr. Carpenter, but I think you'd knock it out of the park. The cold confined indoor space of the Ishimura would be familiar territory for him, especially after helping to create The Thing's setting of an isolated Antarctic research site. I think we're due for another claustrophobic space horror flick, and this franchise would be a match made in heaven with Carpenter.\nWe're already in the middle of a flood of gaming adaptations, such as HBO's The Last of Us series, Amazon's upcoming Fallout series, and a Borderlands movie. Even amidst all these cool projects, I think John Carpenter's take on the Dead Space series would put them all to shame.\nThe post Horror icon John Carpenter calls the Dead Space remake a great game’ appeared first on Destructoid.",

I certainly hope that won't affect my nightmares at all.\nAdditionally, Item Reincarnation looks to add even more reason to grind and upgrade. The A.I. auto-battle function is also seeing an update, which should be great for all those times you don't want to issue commands yourself.\nA demonic strategy\nThe Disgaea series has always offered a signature blend of stylized, cartoon-y devils and immense replayability. Disgaea 7: Vows of the Virtueless certainly looks to have more of both. The improved auto-battle options especially seem like a boon, given how much of my experience with Disgaea was grinding to make the numbers go up.\nThis newest Disgaea is already out in Japan, having released on January 26. But it looks like those in the west hopefully won't have to wait longer until this fall, and there are special editions on the NIS store for those who really want to celebrate a new entry.

Websites would sell out in minutes after a restock, and it quickly became something of a status symbol to flaunt on social media, because either you were lucky enough to get one during a drop, or you had enough disposable income to buy one off a scalper. The shortage occurred for a few different reasons, the foremost of which was the strain that the pandemic placed on global supply chains.\nAfter multiple promises that the console would be more readily available, it appears that the shortage has finally come to a close. In an official blog post, Sony Interactive's Vice President of Brand, Hardware, and Peripherals Isabella Tomatis thanked fans for their \"patience as [Sony] navigated unprecedented demand for the PS5 console amid global challenges.\" She then said that anyone who was still looking to get their hands on a PS5 should have a \"much easier time finding one at retailers globally.\"\n[caption id=\"attachment_360393\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1200\"] Screenshot by Destructoid[/caption]\nEven after promises that they'd ramp up production by the end of last year for the holidays, Sony still had a tough time keeping the console on shelves in 2022. Of course, they gave us similar assurances even before that. I was fine without a PS5 to call my own for the past few years, but now that there are some next-gen games on the horizon that I'm actually pumped for, I'm wanting to get on the bandwagon relatively soon. The ever-popular digital-only version of the PS5 (which is also $100 cheaper than the model that can take disks) is still sold out as of my writing this, but at least there are some options available for purchase right now for players who have patiently waited years for their console.\nThe post Sony says that PS5 consoles will be ‘much easier’ to get this year appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Back to VHS tapes and cartridges\nDon't Nod Montreal is teasing its next project. A new photo for the upcoming game has been shared on social media, alongside a call for job applicants.\nAs shared on Twitter, Don't Nod Montreal spotlights a screen of its new experience, with the caption, \"Does it bring back childhood memories?\" The team says it is hiring on this \"new narrative game\" and lists a link to the Don't Nod career site.\nhttps://twitter.com/DONTNOD_Ent/status/1619009898712268800\nThe project will feature veterans from both Life is Strange and Life is Strange 2, as confirmed by its director Michel Koch. What it might be about is anyone's guess. Though from the décor and vibes alone, I feel like a '90s setting definitely lines up here.\nWhat's in store for Don't Nod\nThe team at Don't Nod has been working on a few projects since the release of Life is Strange back in 2015. The Montreal subsidiary was established in 2020, with a stated goal of creating \"even more ambitious\" titles.\nBetween the follow-up Life is Strange 2 and other projects, like vampire RPG Vampyr and narrative one-offs Tell Me Why and Twin Mirror, Don't Nod has been busy. The company also changed its name, going from Dontnod to Don't Nod, and had a minority stake investment from Tencent.\nThough Life is Strange is now under the wing of another studio, I'm curious to see what the Don't Nod crew are working on next. This image gives off some of the familiar hometown-story vibes that Life is Strange has been known for. But we probably won't know much more about it until Don't Nod Montreal is ready to fully reveal it.\nThe post Don’t Nod Montreal is teasing a nostalgic new project appeared first on Destructoid.",

These numbers were led by successful sales for Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak, which sold 2.75 million copies during this window.

You have until April 26 to redeem the offer: so if you still play Fallout 76, you may as well head here, click \"OK\" and come back to it eventually.\nCan you believe that it's been over four years since this game launched? It's hard to come to terms with the fact that this didn't fizzle out entirely shortly after launch, but at the very least, the Fallout name is still kicking while Bethesda plans their next move. Hopefully it'll make a bigger splash than Fallout 4 did.\nThe post Fallout 76 just added a small bonus for Prime Gaming subscribers appeared first on Destructoid.",

As <a href=\"https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/01/12/marvel-snap-battle-friends-pvp-update-coming-later-this-month\" target=\"_blank\">previously promised</a>, the wait is over because Marvel Snap’s new Battle Mode allows players to take on their buddies, and it goes live today.</p>\n\n<p>Battle Mode allows players to share battle codes with each other for private one-on-one bouts. This match-up consists of multiple back-to-back games with players using the same decks throughout. Players start with 10 health each and whoever wins a game deals 1 point of damage. However, this damage can be doubled by snapping. A player loses when their health hits zero, and there’s no round limit.&nbsp;Developer Second Dinner&nbsp;states that Battle Mode will receive updates expanding its features over the coming months.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For more on Marvel Snap, check out its spot on our <a href=\"https://www.gameinformer.com/goty-2022/2022/12/23/game-informers-top-10-games-of-2022\" target=\"_blank\">Top 10 Games of 2022</a> to find out what makes it so special.

Item Reincarnation lets you transform equipment and items into new forms, such as turning a weapon into a healing item.&nbsp;Auto-battles have been improved with deeper character customization. Now, your forces can stand a better chance against other players' troops&nbsp;in the new online ranked battles.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Unlike Disgaea 6, a Switch exclusive at launch, Disgaea 7:&nbsp;Vows of the Virtuless will be available on multiple platforms on day one.

Movie new teaser cat suit donkey kong Seth Rogen Chris Pratt\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" class=\"image-style-body-default\" /></p>\n\n\n      <p>Nintendo and Illumination have released a new teaser that reveals Mario's famous cat suit as well as more of Seth Rogen's Donkey Kong.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Released during one of yesterday's big NFL games, this teaser is short and sweet, but it features 10 or so seconds of new footage from The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which hits theaters on April 7. In it, we see Donkey Kong begin to pummel Mario, which is a clip we've seen before, before Mario hits a yellow \"?\" block. This gives him the cat suit powerup and while it's useful in the game, that doesn't appear to be the case here as Rogen's Donkey Kong begins to make fun of the suit and Mario's reliance on it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Check it out for yourself in The Super Mario Bros. Movie clip below</strong>:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameBorder=\"0\"  allow=\"autoplay\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Aq7ilIgN2I\" width=\"\"></iframe>\n\n<p>As you can see, this is the most Donkey Kong dialogue we have heard in a teaser for The Super Mario Bros. Movie yet, and it reveals that Rogen's character is basically just him, complete with his signature laugh, too. This clip is yet another that looks great and we can't wait for this movie to hit theaters in a few months on April 7.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For more, <a href=\"https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/11/29/latest-super-mario-bros-movie-trailer-showcases-peach-and-donkey-kong\" target=\"_blank\">check out this trailer from last year that showcases Anya Taylor-Joy's Princess Peach</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p><em>What do you think of this new clip?

In addition to detailing how players will liberate the town of Redfall from its vampiric captors, the team also shared a release date: May 2.</p>\n\n<p>The bulk of the presentation showed off how players, either alone or working with up to three other friends, will cleanse Redfall of vampires neighborhood by neighborhood. In addition to gathering intel about the island and completing side quests, such as rescuing human hostages, you’ll capture safehouses. These become additional human HQs, and gaining more brings you closer to battling the area’s ruling vampire underboss. These elite enemies boast unique attacks and require your full might, along with your team’s efforts, to kill for good.</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameBorder=\"0\"  allow=\"autoplay\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cR8GVePOdpY\" width=\"\"></iframe>\n\n<p>We also got a look at vampire nests. A giant heart fuels these otherworldly dens, and infiltrating one means cutting the heart from the body. Swarms of vampires will try to stop you, of course, but succeeding causes the collapse of a nest, meaning you’ll have to get out fast. Additionally, Arkane showed off the Shroud enemy type, a vampire that can blanket areas in pitch darkness, fire projectiles, as well as phase through floors to evade danger. We also saw a little more of the heroes’ specialized abilities and upgrades, such as granting Layla’s umbrella with a perk that allows it to absorb and fire incoming bullets.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Redfall will be available on Xbox Series X/S and PC and will be available on Game Pass at launch.</p>",

And if you know anything about the studio's previous games, it's a shocking departure in style, tone, and gameplay.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Hi-Fi Rush is a rhythm action where combat, traversal, and even cutscenes all&nbsp;play&nbsp;to the beat of the game's soundtrack. Aesthetically, Hi-Fi Rush sits somewhere between Insomniac Games' Sunset Overdrive and a Saturday morning cartoon – which is to say, bright, over-the-top, and colorful. A far cry from Tango's other outings, such as The Evil Within series and last year's Ghostwire: Tokyo, which both emphasize horror and the supernatural.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameBorder=\"0\"  allow=\"autoplay\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0GlkDcf006I\" width=\"\"></iframe>\n\n<p>Hi-Fi Rush is available later today on PC and Xbox consoles via Game Pass.

Most fixes are related to AI/GS scripting, the recent GUI zoom improvements and the engine variant support. (As ever, see the changelog for further details). With only a short time left before release, please take the effort to test our latest Release Candidate, to find any issues that are still left! Any issues can be reported in the usual place. Additionally, if you are a translator, please see if your language has any missing translations. We greatly appreciate your contribution! Download Changelog Bug tracker",
