          "description": "A quick link to the past.\nWe almost set ourselves the challenge of writing this review without mentioning Link's Awakening. But as sure as a retro-styled 2D RPG includes hackable bushes, Castaway had so many similarities to the Nintendo classic that it would have been impossible. Despite our preference for a fresher take on the formula like the recent Kudzu, in fairness, Canari Games (Lunark) makes no attempt to conceal Castaway's inspiration. The surprising fact is that — even with all the similarities: the pushing puzzles, the hookshot, the waking up on the beach, the identical audio cues, and the almost cloned enemies (down to their very animations) — Castaway reminded us of other SNES and Game Boy games even more.\nCastaway is a very short game. It took us around 30 minutes to beat the three bosses that represent the main threats on 'The Island', the story mode, and to rescue our cute little dog that was kidnapped during the opening cutscene. We spent about an hour on the secondary mode, ‘The Tower’, where we battled our way through 50 floors of increasing difficulty. Addiction took hold a little as we rolled here and there, picking up gold coins from fallen enemies and unlocking new powers – shields, sword buffs, even a protective orb circling the character like in a side-scrolling shooter. We appreciated that this mode was a crafted experience, with no sign of randomly generated levels.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

During the briefest of cutscenes we’re re-introduced to series main man Therion on a gothic-styled spaceship hurtling through the stars. Hekate, his AI companion, says she’s picked up the signal of his father, Vroll, the man responsible for the destruction of Therion’s home planet Valfaris, and someone Therion would very much like to kill. Therion turns and, with a strut, heads off to battle. We found it all delightfully brief.\nWhile the previous game (the idiosyncratic Valfaris) was a hectic Contra-style run-and-gun experience, this sequel has morphed the series into a side-scrolling shooter – R-Type by way of Pacific Rim. The setting is a post-apocalyptic sci-fi hellscape where colour palettes have been maxed out to their highest saturation and contrast, and a pleasingly epic death metal soundtrack accompanies every moment.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Not only is this a return to the roots after the divisive New Gundam Breaker didn’t go over so well with the fanbase, but this marks the first time that the mainline series has come to either the Nintendo Switch or Western audiences. Luckily, Gundam Breaker 4 makes a great first impression—its combat is addictive, the customisation options are second to none, and there’s enough content here to keep you busy for quite a while. If you’ve been looking for a solid new hack ‘n’ slash action game to add to your Switch library, this just may be for you.\nGundam Breaker 4 features a simple story, placing you in the role of a self-insert protagonist who is playing an in-universe version of Gundam Breaker 4. You start out by making a few friends in your ‘online’ sessions who you soon form a clan with, then slowly start building your experience and prestige in the community as you overcome rivals and work up to participate in the big Battle Tournament at the end of the season.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "In the first post for my series on \"saving\" open world design, I complained that many of today's open worlds feel like checklists of formulaic tasks and rewards, their geography a vaporous staging ground for itemisable, cycling content-gathering opportunities, which flies in the face of the sense of freedom and wonder they're supposed to inspire. My interviewees, Elder Scrolls veterans Matt Firor and Nate Purkeypile, argued that this reflects the expense and scale of today's open world productions, which constrains experimental design both at a practical level and in terms of overall direction.\nCD Projekt open world designer Jakub Tomczak doesn't, as far as I know, have an answer to the issue of production bloat, but he does have a disarmingly obvious solution to the 'checklist problem', based on his time creating missions for Cyberpunk 2077 and its Phantom Liberty expansion: get better at hiding the checklist. Weave it into the landscape and setting more artfully, with an elegant balance of randomisation and responsiveness to the player's behaviour which keeps everything fresh. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "I won an awful board game from Nickelodeon once. I say “won”. Actually, I got disconnected phoning into a competition line after I’d gotten through, got upset loudly, my mum called them to complain, they fast tracked me to the next competition thing, I got the quiz answer wrong, and the presenter pretended he’d heard the right answer and pulled a prize out of the big prize bucket. It was a copy of The Game of Life, possibly the least exciting board game a child can win.\nThe game was dog water, and there’s probably a lesson in there somewhere about how cool and good it is to whine until you get free things, but we don’t have time for that. Instead, I’d like to draw your attention to Floops Big House Adventure. It’s a grungy, slimy, Aaahh!!! Real Monsters meets Ren and Stimpy Saturday morning shooter. Some of you will already hate it from the header screenshot, I imagine. Personally, the art drew me right in.\nRead more",

The game was a bright spot in a bad time, which might seem peculiar given that Sluggish Morss often looks like a whale's upset stomach, but it's such a feverishly inventive creation. It blew the dust from my synapses.\nThe same appears true of King-Spooner's upcoming Judero, on which he is collaborating with Soul Searching developer Talha Kaya. It casts you as a \"pagan seer\" armed with a big stick, who is searching the mythical Scottish borderlands for evil creatures to clobber. It looks cheerier and airier than Sluggish Morss, with a more overt emphasis on mechanics such as combat, but it has the same pickled 3am energy to it. It's also now got a release date - 16th September - and a new trailer below.\r\n \nRead more",

It also contains the words “bloody” and “arse” in quick succession, though thankfully not next to each other. The only piles are the logs Sid’s crouched behind as he prepares to sneak up to a cable car guarded by Nazis. That is the only haemorrhoids allusion I will ever make on this website. Until the next time I have to write about Andrew Wilson.\n“Oil just use my trusty knoife” mutters Sid as I take down my first guard. Straight away, the animation and noise indicators evoke the same Shadow Tactics or Desperados III goodness you’re probably expecting. Fine with me - that’s exactly what I’m here for. Mimimi’s closing was a real gutpunch, and while I don’t expect anyone to match their exceptional work any time soon, it’s at least reassuring to see Warsaw studio Artificer picking up the torch.\nRead more",

While it would be a monumentally silly heel turn to go back on their promise of only charging Space Marine 2 players extra for cosmetics a mere week and change before the shooter’s September 9 release date,  the new year one roadmap does at least look piously forthright.\nChatting to James at Gamescom recently (possibly from his cathedral ship made out of graphics cards), Saber boss Tim Willits dragged out an armoured horse and proceeded to flog it mercilessly, saying that players don’t want to be sold the equivalent of Oblivion's infamous deadbeat daddy of DLCs. As several of you identified, this seemed like an odd comparison when Spice Maureen 2 specifically plans to charge for comparable cosmetics, although I imagine Willits was referencing the “packs” that his space game’s baubles come in. “Our fans never thought we ripped them off in World War Z,” he said, comparing Space Marine 2’s optional spendables to that game.\nWhether you see the cosmetic's pricing as egregious or not, yesterday’s roadmap does look to make good on Saber’s promise to keep wearables and playables separate.

          "description": "Almost a decade after his acrimonious departure from Konami, the shadow of Hideo Kojima still looms over Metal Gear Solid. He's there, barely camouflaged, in the undergrowth of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater - a remake of the fifth Metal Gear game, originally released in 2004, which tells the tale of a lone US special operator hunting superweapons and old mentors in the jungles of the southern Soviet Union. \r\n\n\r\nI say \"remake\" but this feels more like a re-release, in spirit. True, it now runs on Unreal Engine, with the option of a manual, third-person perspective and cover-shooter controls in addition to the old top-down viewpoints. Yes, it boasts new flourishes, such as wounds now leaving scars, and clothes picking up stray leaves. Yes, there's a new interface with floating in-world menus, which makes shuffling between the layers a bit less awkward. It's the product of much labour, with development split between Konami and external support partner Virtuos. But where Konami's other big restoration project, Bloober's Silent Hill 2 remake, is a creative dialogue with the original game, Delta seems consumed by faithfulness to Kojima's original design.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's also a free-to-play game, and I have the usual unanswered questions about currencies and gacha, but I'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt for the minute, because I have not spent nearly enough of my life considering the tactical applications of ballgowns.

          "description": "One of my formative video game moments is the final mission of Psygnosis cyberpunk flight sim G-Police. (It came out in 1997, and as such, I think the statute of limitations on spoilers has passed, but if you still intend to play, stop reading now.) The mission completes the long arc of foreshadowing begun by the intro's mention that capital-class spacecraft have been outlawed, following a ruinous war. It turns out that one particular evil corpo has been sneakily building one of these megaships - not only that, but you get to fly inside it, cannons ablazing. It was while doing so that teenage me realised the true exceptionality of the Video Game Artform. You can't fly inside capital ships in, like, symbolist poems or baroque symphonies, can you? You can't fly in poems or symphonies at all, unless you do so metaphorically - \"metaphor\" being a kind of poor man's graphics card.\nThe technology of flight simming has advanced mightily since G-Police's day. For instance: in Everspace 2's just-announced Titans DLC, you get to fly inside not just regular old spaceships, but massive space kaiju with procedurally generated digestive systems. Here's the trailer.\nRead more",

          "description": "Assassin's Creed: Valhalla, Odyssey, and Origins all have one thing in common: they've got a Discovery mode, which replaces murdering with learning. You can, quite literally, go on tours curated by historians around each of the game's respective maps. Instead of diving off a Sphinx and plunging your hidden blade into someone's spinal column, you can look up at the Sphinx and read a paragraph on its significance. Maybe view an actual, real life bit of ancient Egypt from an actual real life museum collection in-game. Perhaps embody an Anglo-Saxon lad in Valhalla, instead, and like, cook up some nettle soup having just got a fresh \"Friar Tuck\" at the local hair choppers (no guarantees on this last bit).\nThis is all to say that Black Myth: Wukong deserves such a mode, too. There were so many times throughout my review time where I stopped and stared and wondered as to something's meaning. Not only in the architecture, but in the characters, too. So here I am with a proposition: how about instead of thwacking things with my staff, I can use it as a walking stick and point it at things I want to learn about.\nRead more",

Still, I was mildly bemused to learn that Mars Attracts, coming sometime next year, is the film’s first licensed game. But then I realised that I’d never thought to check before, which might go some way to explaining the lack of them. Do you reckon they did the pun then worked backwards from there? Respectable, honestly.\nRead more",

I mean, it's only a real-time tactical stealth game set in a cursed 18th century Jesuit monastery, developed by the people behind gorgeously gross metroidvania Blasphemous. It's only got isometric art inspired by Goya and a sanity/trauma system redolent of Darkest Dungeon. Sounds like an automatic RPS write-up to me. \n Read more",

Cowboys? Sure. Wizards? Why not. It barely matters, as long as it results in some good puns. As a studio, Thunderful have a reputation for hopping from one style of game to the next, boiling entire genres down to their essence, and reconstituting them with competence and style to exist within a now-familiar steampunk world of colourful pals and Saturday morning cartoon jokes. The studio is a perpetual notion machine. Yes, with SteamWorld Heist 2, they're revisiting the sci-fi bullet-bouncing of their 2016 tactics game SteamWorld Heist, but they're also introducing significant changes to create a compulsive XCOM-like full of sea-faring submariners that may be their best work yet, even against a back catalogue of blinders. \nRead more",

Mind you, I tend to play games with my nose about 10 centimetres from the screen. Forget being flanked - it's the prospect of snipers up ahead I'm worried about.\nIf you're among the people who fret excessively about flankers, I've got great news from Uncle BioWare. Forthcoming RPG Dragon Age: The Veilguard will support 21:9 ultrawide monitors. The ultrawide functionality extends to cinematics - you can disable \"cinematic aspect ratios\" to switch off the black bars that otherwise hem in the view.

Still, it does sound like he’s managing to have some fun there, mainly by hitting up Saber Interactive COO and former id Software co-owner Tim Willits for some top tips on how to avenge Edwin’s thieving ways.\nTips about kill-stealing aside, James found time to ask Willits about Space Marine 2's microtransactions, and whether there was any nervousness returning to a cult hit series… especially one a lot of people had almost given up on ever seeing again. “Even the “push forward” combat of the original was part of [id’s] inspiration when we created Doom 2016,” answered Willits. “So for me personally, it’s this huge circle. It’s always intimidating working on a franchise that people love.” But, with the right team, technology, and vision he says, “it just comes together.”\nRead more",

You know, something to really convey the flow of the game, rather than the admittedly impressive but nonetheless very fragmented snippets we’ve gotten so far. Now to sit back and…oh, wait. Hang on. It’s just actor Troy Baker telling me about all the great acting he’ll be doing. It is great, by the way. He’s doing a fantastic job. Maybe just, you know, a crumb of acknowledgement or elucidation over the whole ‘interactivity’ part?\nAnyway, don’t mind me. I’m just an old fool who likes to press buttons. And, to be fair, it's not like Machinegames don't have a great track record. Anyway, here’s some good news: The game releases December 9th this year. Have a release date trailer.\nRead more",

So much so, in fact, that I’d assumed the trailer I watched during an online preview event last week was for a new entry in the horror cinematic-platformer series, right up until the name Reanimal appeared on the screen - shortly followed by a snippet of voiced dialogue.\nIt’s not just the horror setting, but the Grimm’s fairytale threat, the distorted adults-made-monsters through the trauma-tinged lens of a child’s imagination. A long-limbed man riding a bicycle in a threadbare suit chases children down an alley. A gangly, bowler-hatted pursuer scuttles down a long table like a spider. It's familiar enough territory, at least at first glance. But when Tarsier have a body of work subconsciously scarred by phantasms this vivid, recurring nightmares are just as potent.\nRead more",

Whether standalone adventure Dying Light: The Beast represents an attempt to course correct after Dying Light 2’s mixed reception, then, I’m not entirely sure.

By that metric, it's the platform's most popular strictly single player game of all the time.\nAll that goodwill has been spoiled, however, by a Steam code handout message to streamers and other \"content creators\" before launch which includes some reactionary, non-binding requests - no mention of \"trigger words\" like \"Covid-19\", no talk of \"politics\" or \"feminist propaganda\", and no mention of \"China's game industry policies, opinions, news, etc\". \n Read more",

If you are not intrigued by that, perhaps the little janitor with a sci-fi vacuum cleaner (or the feel-good music reminiscent of Adventure Time songs) will convince you. \nRead more",

          "description": "Tactical Breach Wizards is a tactics game for people that don’t like tactics games. Magically, it’s also a tactics game for people who love them like nothing else. It’s permissive and demanding; playful and tense. Its globe-spanning plot covers conspiracies, PMCs, and brutal theocratic dictatorships. It also features a traffic-summoning warlock named Steve wearing a hi-vis robe. It’s finding that one absolutely, perfectly ridiculous XCOM turn, every turn…and at the same time knowing it’s absolutely, perfectly fine if you don’t. In short: it’s one of the most enjoyable tactics games I’ve ever played, and the only tactics game with a pyromancer so rubbish he relies on making his enemies pass out from heatstroke.\nRead more",

They've also shared a little about why it's taken so long to arrive - the (generally decent) action-RPG hit PS5 over a year ago, back when I was still some filthy console-playing freelancer.\nAccording to director Hiroshi Takai, it was \"impossible\" to create the PC and PS5 versions at the same time, even if Square Enix hadn't been restrained by a timed exclusivity clause. He also thinks that the Final Fantasy series faces no \"existential risk\" right now, despite lower-than-hoped returns from both Final Fantasy 16 and, going by Square Enix's latest financial reports, the more recent and currently PS5-only Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.\n Read more",

          "description": "Silent Hill has a messy, up-is-down relationship with time and history, so let's go about this hands-on with the Silent Hill 2 Remake in a messy, up-is-down way. Developed well over two decades ago, the original Silent Hill 2 is the magnum opus of Polish horror stalwarts Bloober Team. Running on then-innovative \"Unreal Engine 5\" technology created by Jazz Jackrabbit publishers Epic MegaGames, it's a wonderful abyss of a game that remains perfectly playable today, given a certain amount of tolerance for the quirks of the era.\nIt begins with your character, James Sunderland, descending from the road towards the eponymous Midwestern nowhere-town. Like many games of the period, Silent Hill 2 uses a third-person, over-the-shoulder manual camera, which allows you to glance fearfully up at the monstrous pine trees that fringe the path - each rising from a bulging tide of fog that menaces with the suggestion of approaching figures. There is moisture everywhere, gushing from drain pipes and dribbling down concrete barriers. As you amble into the murk, deathly chords and groaning, unmechanical motifs reverberate from somewhere deep underground. \r\n \nRead more",

The 2022 version of Modern Warfare 2 lacked the original’s multiplayer, and H2M was so highly-anticipated that Steam sales of the 2016 FPS balooned in the lead-up to the mod’s planned release date. It didn't hurt that Activision had it on sale, of course, but the timing lined up so well that some fans speculated the discount was a deliberate bait-and-switch on the publisher’s part to profit from excitement over a mod they were already planning to shut down.\nRead more",

          "description": "When Bloober and Konami announced that they were remaking Silent Hill 2 as part of a comprehensive series reboot, it made immediate if slightly deflating sense to me. Silent Hill 2 is the more feted of the Hills - if I were a calculating franchise custodian tasked with 'bringing back' one of the acclaimed original trilogy, that's probably the instalment I and my spreadsheets would fix upon. I mean, it's the game with Pyramid Head in it - the nearest thing Silent Hill has to a mascot, and it's not like there's an issue of cutting out plot material: each game in the Silent Hill series is, on some level, a distinct story with a distinct protagonist.\nStill, the decision to 'skip' the first game in the series, whose world, narrative themes, music and art direction set the parameters for all the rest, made my brain itch a bit, and when I ran into Bloober's creative director Mateusz Lenart and lead producer Maciej Głomb at a Konami event, I had to ask about it. \r\n \nRead more",

Players picked between a more modern title in RuneScape 3 and a nostalgia-fueled experience with OSRS. Over a decade later, both games retain active player bases, although the debate rages on about which of the two is better.\n\n\nThese games took very separate paths, including diverging questlines. Some quests were exclusive to RuneScape 3, while others were made just for OSRS. Over the years, Old School RuneScape has looked to RS3 for inspiration several times, occasionally bringing over quests still worth doing.\n\n\nThe most recent example is 'While Guthix Sleeps', which debuted in Old School RuneScape in July 2024, 16 years after its RS3 release.

          "description": "The Dark Lord from Castlevania is the fog's most diverse killer in Dead by Daylight. Dracula is a killer that can shapeshift into several forms, each tailored to effectively hunt survivors. Here is how to counter Dracula in Dead by Daylight.\n\n\nImage via Behaviour Interactive\n\n\nDracula has three forms he can switch between on the fly. Only his Vampire and Wolf form are capable of attacking, while his Bat form is used primarily to quickly cover ground. The general strategy for dealing with Dracula is to keep running. Both his Wolf and Vampire form have anti-looping abilities that easily catch survivors who run straight for pallets and windows.\n\n\nHow to counter Vampire form\n\n\nIn Vampire form, Dracula can use the Hellfire spell to shoot out seven flame pillars in a straight line. You can dodge this attack by making quick, sharp turns away from Dracula's line of sight. When he's charging or canceling the Hellfire spell, Dracula's speed is decreased drastically, so you can also use this time to run.\n\n\nHow to counter Wolf form\n\n\nWith Wolf form, Dracula can charge two Pounces to quickly leap forward and attack. Similar to the Hellfire spell, Dracula will slow down when charging a pounce, so you know to dodge when he begins to slow down. To avoid a Pounce, hug the walls in a loop and continue running. If Dracula Pounces into an object, it'll trigger a lengthy animation, buying you some time.\n\n\nHow to counter Bat form\n\n\nBat form gives Dracula the Undetectable status effect, a hefty speed boost, and the ability to teleport to vault points within 32 meters. Dracula can't attack in this form or see survivors so he'll need to rely on scratch marks, pools of blood, and noise to track survivors. You can throw Dracula off your trail by running in one direction, then walking back the way you came. If Dracula is close, you can run straight through him as he has no collision in Bat form.\n\nThe post How to counter Dracula in Dead by Daylight appeared first on Destructoid.",

They are needed to feed the growing worm in the Zodiac Village, so here’s what you need to know how to farm them up.\n\n\nWhere to find rice cocoons in Black Myth: Wukong\n\n\nTo find rice cocoons in Black Myth: Wukong, you need to destroy all the cocoons that are around the Webbed Hollow area. Unfortunately, there aren’t any guarantees that you’ll find all three rather quickly. \n\n\nIt’s not a designated drop either from any particular enemy. You just have to keep destroying these cocoons and hope that RNG blesses you with good luck. So, while you’re traversing through the Webbed Hollow, try destroying every or most cocoon you see on the ground.\n\n\nYou should also try destroying the larger cocoons that start moving and eventually hatch into a Lesser Yaoguai. Once they break out of them and become normal enemies, they will not drop this resource.\n\n\nIf you want a place to somewhat farm cocoons, it’s best to use the area by the Bonevault. This is near where you’d meet the Horse Guai for the fourth time if you followed his quest.\n\n\nThere are a lot of eggs between the shrine and getting to that area. Once you destroy as many eggs as you find in your path, use your Incense Trail Talisman to teleport back to the shrine and repeat it.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nWhat to do with rice cocoons\n\n\nOnce you have all three rice cocoons, you will take them to Chen Loong, the seed trader NPC at the Zodiac Village. There’s a vessel housing a small Armourworm just by the rest of the crops. \n\n\nYou can only feed it one at a time, meaning that once you give one cocoon, you have to go back to the Shrine and do it again. After the third time, you’ll receive the Elder Armourworm Spirit to use and cultivate.\n\nThe post Where to find rice cocoons in Black Myth: Wukong appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The Black Ops 6 beta revolutionizes classic loadouts with the introduction of the convenient Dedicated Melee system. This innovative mechanic makes it a breeze to wield your tools, permitting you to use them at any moment. We'll show you how to use a Melee weapon in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 beta to guide you through this new tactic.\n\n\nBlack Ops 6 beta Dedicated Melee guide\n\n\nIn Black Ops 6 beta, you can equip your Melee weapon by holding the 'Melee' button. This differs from past entries like Modern Warfare 3, where Melees usually occupied the Secondary Weapon section. With the beta, a third slot is now designated for the more compact weapons, giving you a total of three tools in your arsenal.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nIf you've performed Finishing Moves in the past, the Melee interaction utilizes the same button and process. The only difference is that Finishing Moves requires an enemy Operator close by, similar to the returning Body Shield feature. So, as long as nobody is around you, you can freely equip your Melee weapon. You'll also activate unlimited Tac Sprint while holding this tool, allowing you to travel more efficiently.\n\n\nKeep in mind that the standard 'Switch Weapon' interaction does not work for Melee weapons. However, you can use it to swap out your knives for your Primary and Secondary.\n\n\nWhile the Black Ops 6 beta currently offers a limited selection of tools, with the knife being the sole tool in the Melee category, there's a lot to look forward to. The upcoming Weekend Two and the official launch are sure to bring more weapons, diversifying the collection and enhancing your gameplay.  \n\nThe post How to use Melee weapon in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 beta appeared first on Destructoid.",

It’s required if you want to get the secret ending of the game alongside clearing all the secret areas.\n\n\nWith all that said, here’s how you can start it and what you need to do to complete it.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nHow to start the Treasure Hunter quest in Black Myth: Wukong\n\n\nThe quest will first start once you reach the Bitter Lake area in Chapter 3. Find the North Shore of the Bitter Lake Shrine as the main starting point. Go back from where you found the shrine to end up at a red gate.\n\n\nGo through this gate and proceed on this trail until you run into another building at a fork in the road. The Treasure Hunter should be sitting right there. After clearing the enemies, you can talk to him. As always, exhaust his dialogue to progress.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nHow to complete the Treasure Hunter quest\n\n\nProgress onward through the chapter up until you reach the Towers of Karma Shrine in the Valley of Ecstasy. Here, you should already have the Ring of Fire ability at this time. \n\n\nYou’ll find the Treasure Hunter again, telling you that he’s cold. It’s implied that you need to use the Ring of Fire ability near him to warm him up. In doing so, you’ll get a new cutscene followed by some dialogue.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nYou have to get to the Melon Field to complete this quest. We have a whole guide on how to get there from this area, which you can check out here.\n\n\nThe closest shrine to get there is the one in the Forest of Felicity. Staying on the initial right path, then hugging the left side of the path from there will eventually take you there.\n\n\nIn the end, you will have to fight a boss to initiate the last cut scene of the quest, but then you’ll also be given the Spell Binder ability.\n\nThe post How to complete the Treasure Hunter quest in Black Myth: Wukong appeared first on Destructoid.",

This article will fill you in on the Club Challenge details and several changes that we can see in FC Mobile 25 Beta.\n\n\nWhat is Club Challenge in FC Mobile 25 Beta?\n\n\nImage via EA Sports\n\n\nClub Challenge is the new PvP tournament mode in FC Mobile 25 Beta where you can play a H2H match with the LaLiga clubs. Plus, it features a new broadcast package that has new commentary, stadium dressings, podiums, trophies, and much more.\n\n\nThe challenge has three rounds, and you get 10 retries for each match. Plus, there are rewards for each round. Check out what you can win:\n\n\n\nRound one: Coin x 100,000\n\n\nRound two: Coin x 100,000\n\n\nRound three: Coin x200,000\n\n\n\nKeep in mind, though, that you can only log in with a guest account in the FC Mobile 25 Beta. Any progress or rewards you earn won’t transfer to the main game.\n\n\nWhat are the gameplay changes in FC Mobile 25 Beta?\n\n\n\nIf you are a hardcore player in FC Mobile, then you have realized that the AI difficulty in high-tier matches is very low, and in FC Mobile 25 Beta, the AI difficulty is enhanced so that you can equal competition in high-tier matches.\n\n\nIt also fixed an issue in Manager Mode where some of your through passes overshoot their target.\n\n\nThe post FC Mobile 25 Beta: Club Challenge and gameplay changes appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Are you feeling trusting? Interested in getting Guilty Gear Strive on Switch. Arc System Works has a deal for you. If you preorder the physical addition from their online store, you can get a “Free Mystery Gift” bundled in.\n\n\nI’m honestly not sure how “free” it is since it comes up for me at $83, which is more than Switch games typically go for, even when converted to Canadian Loonies. That sounds like you’re paying something to get it, which means it isn’t free. Maybe that’s just weirdness with regional pricing. However, the store page does say that it has a value of $29.98. That kind of puts it in keychain territory.\n\n\nBut maybe it’s not a keychain. Maybe it’s something way cooler like a hat pin. Maybe it’s Guilty Gear Strive on PS4. Maybe they’re bundling in one of the DLC seasons. Maybe it’s literally just $29.98 in cash. It could be anything worth $29.98, and value is in the wallet of the beholder. Our boy Eric Van Allen is brave enough to find out. Are you?\n\n\nI love Guilty Gear Strive. I can’t play it for too long at the time because the opening dialogue that says “Mankind knew they cannot change society. So instead of reflecting on themselves, they blamed the Beasts” every fucking fight wears on me. I don’t want to skip the introduction, but I also don’t want to listen to that pseudointellectual prose every fight. What was wrong with just “Heaven or Hell?” Couldn’t they just say it once and be done with it?\n\n\nWhat were we talking about? Oh, right. Currently, I’ve only been able to find the mystery gift deal on the official Arc System Works Gear store. It’s available for preorder right now and will ship when the game releases January 23, 2025.\n\nThe post You can preorder Guilty Gear Strive on the Arc Store and get a “Free Mystery Gift” appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Atlus recently brought on Nier developer Yoko Taro (spotted by Automaton, who also drew attention to the key quote) to promote their upcoming Metaphor ReFantazio. While Yoko Taro is not generally associated with Atlus (or Sega), he was very enthusiastic about the new game, stating, “It’s so stylish, I almost wet myself.”\n\n\nWe’ve all been there; playing a game so captivating that our weakened bladders give out. Sometimes, not enough to breach the silk of our underpants, but other times so voluminous that a replacement couch must be brought in immediately (I assume most people keep a spare on hand for emergencies). In this case, it was the UI that Taro found so pant-soakingly amazing. Who doesn’t appreciate a good typeface? The first time I saw Microsoft Word’s Wordart, I nearly died of dehydration.\n\n\n\n\nTaro stresses that he was neither incentivized nor under duress when he gave his opinion. He says he’s a fan of Atlas and later clarifies, “Oh, I didn’t get any money for this! I’m just a middle-aged dude who showed up,” he said. Much of the video posted on YouTube is just tomfoolery – the best type of foolery – alongside voice actress Tomomi Isomura. He spends a good amount of time talking about Nier. Admittedly, it gets pretty bizarre. Eventually, it’s just his mask on a box that he’s voicing over. Really on brand for Yoko Taro.\n\n\nMetaphor Refantazio looks like a good time. I don’t think I’ll actually play it because it’s likely going to be a jillion hours long. I don’t have time for that these days. Unless the bosses here asked me to cover it and gave me, like, a week off to play it. Then I’d play it. And they should totally do that.\n\n\nMetaphor Refantazio releases October 11, 2024 and will be available for PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.\n\nThe post Yoko Taro says Metaphor ReFantazio is “so stylish, I almost wet myself” appeared first on Destructoid.",

The tactic offers many advantages by safely guarding you from enemy gunfire. We'll show you how to use Body Shield in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 beta.\n\n\nHow to perform Body Shield in Black Ops 6 beta\n\n\nTo use Body Shield in Black Ops 6 beta, sneak up behind an enemy and double-tap the Melee button. The interaction appears when you're close to the opponent, which will also display a prompt for a Finishing Move (holding the button instead). It'll be tricky to do with all the chaos going around, so it may take a few tries to master.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nI find it best to perform the Body Shield while holding a Melee weapon, as it helps you move around faster. Some maps also have more hiding spots for you to use, including the train yard in Derelict. Then, once you complete it, you'll temporarily gain control of the opponent with the free range to move around. Look out for the meter at the center of the screen to determine how long the shield will last. It goes by quickly, and the \"victim\" can even call for help to cut it short. Just try to take advantage of the shield while you can and shoot down anyone in your way.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nWhen the Body Shield victim has done their part, you'll have the option to Quick Kill or Execute (Finishing Move) them.

          "description": "Like many early access periods, Black Ops 6 beta is reasonably limited in various specs. One, in particular, is the level cap, which won't be as substantial as the official version. So, if you want to know about its restrictions, here's the max level cap in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 beta. \n\n\nBlack Ops 6 beta max level cap, explained\n\n\nThe max level cap for Black Ops 6 beta Weekend One is Level 20. You'll be able to reach this tier by completing Daily Challenges and earning enough XP from the various modes. In return, you'll unlock all the Custom Loadout features, at least for the first weekend.\n\n\nLevel 4 proves to be the most crucial rank out of all of them, considering that it unlocks the customizable loadouts. Fortunately, you'll obtain a few pre-made builds by Level 1 to get you through the early matches. Beta rewards will also be available, ending with the Squish Westpoint Operator Skin.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nIf you haven't pre-ordered Black Ops 6, you can tune into Weekend Two, which doesn't require a pre-order status. The max level cap raises to Level 30 at this point, bringing more rewards to your arsenal. Unlock gear such as the Combat Axe, Tac Mask Perk, and Chopper Gunner Scorestreak to get easy kills. The last tier earns you the Bug Smasher Weapon Blueprint, designed for the XM4 Assault Rifle.\n\n\nGet ready for a much higher level cap once the Black Ops 6's beta period concludes. The updated Prestige systems will undoubtedly change up this feature, starting at the maximum Level 55. Although Prestige won't be available for the beta, you can use this time to hone your craft for the official launch.\n\nThe post What is the max level cap in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 beta? appeared first on Destructoid.",
