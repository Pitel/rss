A time when Saints Row and Saints Row 2 were lighthearted Grand Theft Auto alternatives, then Saints Row: The Third came along and cranked up the silliness, and then Saints Row 4 grabbed the lever and cranked it so hard it snapped. So, yes, this year's Saints Row reboot is technically Saints Row 5, except it’s more of a careful reboot. Where does it really sit on the timeline? At both ends, I reckon.\nRead more",

Sadly, it's true. It is a drier, slower and more bucolic take on the exact same game. \nRead more",

It's an ethos encapsulated by the game’s own time loop, in which protagonist Colt Vahn relives the same day again and again as he searches for a way to break free of it - an idea that was, among other things, designed to encourage something hardcore Arkane fans had been doing already – replaying the game over and over again.\nWhile Dishonored had gently suggested repeat playthroughs with its kill/non-lethal runs, plenty of players still called it a day at the end of their first playthrough.

          "description": "It’s been a hot minute since a cute animal adventure scarred me for life. Ever since the first Shelter game where my sweet baby badger got snatched up by the claws of a giant eagle, I’ve learned that these adorable animal games can be pretty ruthless. It’s the maternal connection that gets me, the pang of loss for something you were supposed to protect. It shoots right between the ribs and straight into the heart. Ow.\nEndling - Extinction Is Forever is one such game. You play as a fox mother trying to keep her four cubs alive in a post-apocalyptic world, and from that premise alone it definitely feels like developers Herobeat Studios are deadset on making me cry. After playing through the game in two evenings, Endling didn’t end up being the emotional gut punch I had braced myself for, but its story of scrappy survival did have me reaching for the tissues by the closing credits. What can I say, I see an animal in distress and I’m a weepy mess.\nRead more",

As an owner of two tortoiseshells myself, they've unlocked routes in our house I never knew existed, using the tiny lip of our fridge as a gateway to the top of our kitchen cupboards, bed frames as launch pads to the middle bar of our sash windows (not even the actual window sill, those daft beasts), and don't even get me started on how they managed to get onto the top of our 2cm wide shower rail that one time.\nStray, BlueTwelve Studio's cat 'em up explorathon, puts you in the paws of a similarly savvy feline protagonist. The cat itself is a marvel of digital observation, fully inhabiting all of the best cat-isms I know and love. You can scratch the backs of sofas and knead and shred carpets with alternate squeezes of the trigger buttons, meow at will, lap from dripping water bowls, topple piles of carefully stacked books and push paint cans off the edge of ledges - and, if you leave them idle long enough, they'll stretch and catch flies too tiny to be caught by the human eye. You can also play a mean game of billiards, much to the annoyance of the local robots. I wouldn't go as far as saying it loosened my jaw quite as much as when I first set eyes on Trico from The Last Guardian, all told, but I reckon if BlueTwelve had the same kind of budget and scale as GenDesign and Sony's Japan Studio did back then, then Stray's cat would be every bit the equal of that famous cat-bird-chimera.\nRead more",

Xbox’s parental restrictions on loot box purchases for under-18s were singled out for praise, and the government now say they will legislate if the rest of the industry doesn’t follow suit.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Nonetheless, there are still a fair few offers still running on the WD Blue SN570, a seasoned member of the best SSDs club owing to its high PCIe 3.0 speeds and relatively affordable pricing.\r\n\n\r\nIt’s even more affordable now, of course, especially if you’ve got an Amazon Prime account and are in the UK. The 1TB and 2TB models – both capacious enough to act as your PC’s sole storage drive – have Prime-exclusive savings on Amazon UK, with the 1TB SN570 a few quid cheaper than it was during last year’s Black Friday sales.\r\n\n \nRead more",

That means some prices are back to normal, some aren’t, and the entire concept of a deal becomes kind of nebulous and squishy. And yet, there will undoubtedly be people out there desperate for a new graphics card – any new graphics card – so let’s take a look at what’s out there.\r\n\n\r\nThe bad news is that the vast majority of Prime Day GPU “deals” still reach above the respective card’s original retail price. The good news is that I’ve found a small handful of offers that are, if nothing else, good value by the incredibly whacked-out standards of the past two years. First up, there are a couple of Nvidia GeForce RTX 30 series cards worth considering in the UK, including an MSI-made RTX 3070 (that Ebuyer have price matched). Sticking with RTX cards, which can run both DLSS and DLAA, GameStop have a reasonable RTX 3060 deal for US buyers.\r\n\n \nRead more",

My mind is so focused on video games, that I can still point out the bowling alleys that had a Metal Slug cabinet. I recall the time that one place had Marvel vs. Capcom 2 and X-Men vs. Street Fighter. What a win! When I went to Japan, I stopped in every tobacco-scented game center I crossed paths with.\nI recently changed my life by getting a decent arcade stick. It’s very difficult to find any cabinets these days (I wonder if the Galaxy Theatre still has Virtual On), but the feeling of slamming my fingers across a cluster of big ol’ buttons eases my longing.\nBut a good arcade stick is nothing without games to play using it.…",

You might wonder why, of all things, this clarification is important. Or maybe why it has to be clarified at all. For that, we'll need to take a trip through Silent Hill history.\nIn the original 1999 game, white dots pepper the sky outside.

But if you're a PC owner wanting in on the fast-paced, retro-styled action, then fear not, as Inti Creates has announced that the cool-looking release will be getting a Steam port this winter.\nAs we have previously reported, Azure Striker Gunvolt 3 is the long-awaited third chapter in a saga that began on Nintendo 3DS way back in 2014. This new chapter will see dual heroes Gunvolt and Kirin hack, slash, and shoot their way through flashy 2.5D platform action. Switching between the two characters on the fly, players will be encouraged to synergize each character's respective skills to fight off an army of dangerous droids and towering end-of-stage guardians.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3icCimtZdLI\nAdding to this anime-infused chaos, an intriguing new mechanic known as \"Image Pulse\" will enable Gunvolt to utilize his memories of battle to call upon the skills of his former opponents, arming himself with the skills of over 150 allies and enemies from the entire trilogy. Additionally, Gunvolt and Kirin will be guided by the evocative, dulcet tones of their virtual oracle, Anthem, whose song will spearhead the duo's assault and even boost their battle abilities. Some fascinating little features there.\nAzure Striker Gunvolt 3 launches on Nintendo Switch July 28. An Xbox edition will launch on August 2, with the PC port scheduled for this winter. A physical edition is currently in the works at Limited Run Games, with price, details, and release date still to be revealed.\nThe post Azure Striker Gunvolt 3 comes blasting onto PC this winter appeared first on Destructoid.",

The publisher confirms today that Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is moving to fiscal year 2023-2024.\nPreviously set to launch in 2022, this delay pushes Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora out of the year and up to at least April 2023. The news arrived via Ubisoft's financial earnings today, and no more specifics were given on a date.\nIt shouldn't be a huge surprise though, as we've yet to see much of this new Avatar game. While a June 2021 trailer gave us a cinematic look at what's in store, we haven't seen much else in the time since.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Axmg1E4HrVE\nIt does seem to be more of the Navi and space corporation fighting each other, much like in the original Avatar film. The Frontiers of Pandora game is also set for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, but not previous-generation consoles.\nIn its financial statement, Ubisoft says it is working on taking full advantage of next-gen technology, as it sees the Avatar brand as a \"major multi-year opportunity\" for Ubisoft.\nThe fall window ahead\nUbisoft also announced a few more changes to its upcoming slate. First off, it delayed a smaller but unannounced premium game from 2022-2023 into 2023-2024.\nAlso, as noted by Axios' Stephen Totilo on Twitter, Ubisoft canceled development of four more games. These are Splinter Cell VR, Ghost Recon Frontline, and two unannounced games. No further details were given on why.\nThis still leaves two fairly large games in Ubisoft's upcoming fall lineup. Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope is set for October 20, 2022 on Nintendo Switch. And the long-awaited pirate ship sim Skull and Bones finally locked in a date for November 8, on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PC, and cloud services. Those who wanted to fly across the plains of Pandora this year will have to settle for the high seas instead.\nThe post Ubisoft delays Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora into 2023 to 2024 window appeared first on Destructoid.",

No time has been announced just yet.\nhttps://twitter.com/DestinyTheGame/status/1550133920838008833\n\"Witness what's next,\" the tweet advertises. Whatever it is, that fleet of pyramid ships sure does seem like bad news for all Guardians out there.\nAs for what's in store, Destiny 2 is still in the throes of wrapping up the story from The Witch Queen expansion. The game is currently in the midst of the Season of the Haunted, which ends on August 23.\nThe light ahead\nA new season is likely in the cards. More content leading up to the next expansion seems pretty likely too. Lightfall is the next expansion due up on Bungie's Destiny 2 roadmap and we don't have a firm picture of that yet, save that it's likely a 2023 launch given Witch Queen's launch this year.\nBungie does have one more expansion confirmed for after Lightfall, dubbed The Final Shape, in the conclusion of what it's calling the Light and Darkness saga. It seems like the roadmap stretches pretty far out into the future for the online shooter.\nThe Destiny 2 studio has also gone through some changes over the last year or so, though. Bungie is now officially a PlayStation studio, as the acquisition has finally closed out.\nIt seems like interesting times ahead for the studio behind the persistent multiplayer sci-fi shooter. We'll see what Bungie has in store for the future of Destiny 2 on August 23.\nThe post Bungie announces Destiny 2 showcase for August 23 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Reading for Robots\nQuantic Dream's sci-fi drama title Detroit: Become Human is getting set to make a comeback, but not quite in the form you might have expected. As reported by Famitsu, the 2018 cinematic adventure is being adapted into a manga series, with the first volume of Detroit: Become Human Tokyo Stories hitting the streets of Japan tomorrow.\nChoosing to take its own localized narrative over that of the video game, Detroit: Become Human Tokyo Stories will tell the tale of an android idol, who models, performs, and entertains her fans in the far-flung future of 2038. Much like the video game, however, the manga will confront the typical themes of robotic sentience, the dangers of advanced A.I., and the prejudice of man against those different from themselves. The story is written by Kazami Sawatari with the art daubed by Moto Sumida.\nhttps://twitter.com/sawatari_kazami/status/1549590228934963201?s=20&t=CbiFSUq8L1hu3ltcYh97uQ\nThe new manga is not the first non-gaming adaptation of the Quantic Dream title. In fact, it's not the first time the franchise has focused on Japan for its chin-stroking pontification. Back in 2018, Sony Japan released a short movie, Tokyo: Become Human, to help promote the game's launch within the territory. The new manga genuinely sounds pretty interesting, with themes suited to Japan's love of next-generation technology. Unfortunately, there are currently no plans for an English localization, but perhaps we will see a fan translation down the line.\nDetroit: Become Human is available now on PC and PS4.\nThe post Detroit: Become Human is getting a manga spin-off in Japan appeared first on Destructoid.",

All of those are featured in the promo video below, which is a fun little literal gaiden (side story) dealing with core cast members in anime form. Wattson even literally does a Kamehameha, but the One Piece, My Hero Academia, and Naruto inspirations are the most obvious places the development team goes.\nThere's also a big spender promo going on, as you can \"unlock all the skins to automatically get the Bangalore Apex Commander prestige skin.\" I mean, this IP has to have a TV show at some point, right? That's just how every lucrative \"this didn't go out of business for several years\" gaming IP rolls now.\nAn anime tie-in event is a normal theme to go for in the genre (as well as MOBAs), as it kind of just seems inevitable.

A mess of torn leather, twisted sinew, melted flesh, and bin bag clothing, JustGeek's new statue hopes to disgust as much as it bemuses, with attention paid to every crease, fold, and tear in both Nemesis' clothing and his face. And as if his huge frame wasn't enough to get your inner Jill running, yer boy is equipped with his wall-shattering rocket launcher. Kaboom.\n\nThe Resident Evil Nemesis statue is now available to pre-order over on the JustGeek store. Nemesis retails for £99.99, (or roughly $120 USD), not including shipping or any potential customs charges. Payment options are also available. Nemesis is expected to ship in November 2022, although this is subject to change given the general material and production woes impacting the general industry.\nFor more details, images, and payment options, go check out the official JustGeek website.\nThe post JustGeek’s Resident Evil Nemesis statue will ward off (tiny) intruders appeared first on Destructoid.",

While Sucker Punch Productions recently went on record to say that the team isn't working on a new inFAMOUS (or Sly Cooper) game right now, there is a bit of news: some DLC for inFAMOUS Second Son popped up on the PlayStation Store.\nIf you were browsing the storefront today to see what's new, this \"July 20\" release would've been a head-turner — but the DLC in question, Cole's Legacy, is not new for inFAMOUS Second Son. These missions were originally a part of the limited edition.\nIn a move that other studios should try and follow, Sucker Punch has released Cole's Legacy for free in \"most regions, except those that require a small fee due to local restrictions,\" so you can claim the DLC right now on the PlayStation Store. Might as well!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/T4XlJrbY3ow\nPlay it for the jacket, if anything\nIt's worth going through if you have a deep personal history with inFAMOUS and inFAMOUS 2; Zeke's back, kinda, but the scope is admittedly limited. The main thing: if you complete Cole's Legacy, you'll be able to dress up Second Son star Delsin with Cole's jacket.\nOn Twitter, Sucker Punch also confirmed that it hopes to separately release Fetch's D.U.P. outfit — a former pre-order bonus — for inFAMOUS First Light. And maintenance on the inFAMOUS 2 UGC (user-generated content) servers has wrapped up, as promised.\nGames often tie outfits or smaller pieces of content to pre-orders, first-wave \"day one\" editions, and collector's sets. It can be a way to incentivize early adoption without going overboard. The problem is, some of this stuff is never offered again, and it becomes lost to time. In cases like this, it's never too late to make it right — fans will be thankful.\nThey'd also appreciate remasters of the PS3 games.

Film character Cole is seen setting off for Los Angeles, possibly in search of a certain movie star with some martial arts prowess.\nWhile it certainly had some high points and some dips, I overall enjoyed my time with the new Mortal Kombat. It had some good action and fight scenes. The Scorpion vs. Sub Zero fight scene was worth admission on its own.\nMeanwhile, the video game adaptation train carries on at full speed. The HBO Last of Us production looks set for next year, and Sonic the Hedgehog continues to break the box office with even more in the works. Heck, even Duke Nukem might be getting in on the silver screen bandwagon.\nConsidering that Mortal Kombat turned out pretty okay compared to other video game adaptations, I'm game to see a new one and find out where Cole's story goes from here.

Now, five years later, Straley has just announced that he will be jumping back into the world of game development by forming his very own studio known as Wildflower Interactive.\n\"Wildflower starts with everything I created, pushed and learned about gameplay, characters and story, and directing teams while at Naughty Dog — but applied to a smaller studio to keep communication easy and creatively fluid,\" Straley says.\n\"I’ve surrounded myself with an amazing group — some new faces, some old colleagues — that are pushing our concepts of what kind of game we want to create, the process we use to make it, the kind of team and culture we all want to be a part of, and what giving back to our industry ultimately looks like.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMEgkVZTLIM\nStraley even created a video to give us a little insight into his process of creating the studio, which all started with an idea that he and some colleagues were bouncing around. When they realized that that game was something they had to make, well, that's how Wildflower was born.\nAs someone who really admires Straley's work, it's really cool to not only see him return, but to see him looking genuinely happy to do so. Based on ideas he's shared in the past for the kinds of games he wants to make, I'll be interested to see how Wildflower shakes things up in the future.\nStraley said that the studio is going to \"go silent for a bit\" to \"focus on building the team and game,\" but I know we'll have a ton to look forward to from them in the future.\nThe post Former Naughty Dog co-director announces new studio, Wildflower appeared first on Destructoid.",

The side-scrolling stealth adventure tells the story of Mudokan Abe as he once again risks life and limb to protect the sanctity of his people from armies of greedy, capitalist overlords. Outnumbered and outgunned, Abe must use cunning, guile, scavenged goods, and his fellow escapees in order to turn fortune in his favor, lest his race is wiped out by the miserable Glukkons.\n\nIn addition to the Nintendo Switch port news, Microids also revealed two physical \"odditions\" that are also in production. A standard Limited Oddition includes a physical boxed copy of Oddworld: Soulstorm, three art prints, and a metal carry case that holds up to 24 Switch cartridges. For die-hard fans, the Collector's Oddition includes the aforementioned items, but also adds a hardcover art book, a keychain, sticker sheet, and a figurine of our hero in full-on tiptoe mode.\nPre-order customers will also receive a digital soundtrack as well as a digital version of the art book. While pre-orders for the physical odditions are live, Microids seem a little closed on where exactly the physical version can be pre-ordered — with different territories carrying different participating retailers. In addition, neither a price nor a release date for the Switch edition of Oddworld: Soulstorm is available.\nThe post Oddworld: Soulstorm Oddtimized Edition headed to Nintendo Switch appeared first on Destructoid.",

The animated series is currently in pre-production as a joint venture between Bardel Entertainment, Kinetic Media, and SC Productions. A premiere date was not announced.\n\"Grounded has caught the imagination of millions of people and we've learned that the biggest fans want even more of that world,\" said game director Adam Brennecke in a press release. \"This partnership will allow us to give fans more Grounded while expanding the world that so many have come to love.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsUvQaTi6nc\nThe Grounded show will, much like its video game counterpart, tell the story of a group of kids forced to fend themselves against bugs and critters of all shapes and sizes when they are shrunken down via some mysterious and unstable technology. And if fending off gargantuan wasps, spiders, ants, and beetles weren't enough, the kids must find a way to return to full size in order to expose a conspiracy threatening the entire town... Think Honey, I Shrunk the Kids meets All the President's Men. Probably.\nGrounded will be written by Brent Friedman (Star Wars: Clone Wars, Star Trek: Enterprise) and directed by Brien Goodrich (Halo). A special panel is set to take place at San Diego Comic-Con (SDCC) where the first details about the show, its premise, characters, and cast are likely to be outlined. Production for the Grounded TV show is in its infancy, so it is very unlikely that we'll see it hit our screens until later in 2023 at the very earliest.\nThe post Grounded to be adapated into animated TV series appeared first on Destructoid.",

They're actually a project from artist kelfunncheng.\nIn the 10-ish-minute video below, which is really down-to-earth to the point where the process actually seems feasible, they walk us through how they managed to craft the shoes. Talking us through, kelfunncheng says that this is their first time painting shoes, and they wanted to document the entire process.\nThere's a lot of preparation involved, including cleaning up the shoes, and taping them up. The creator practiced on several household objects to test shades/color mixing, as well as a general painting technique. Again, it's a really relatable video, as they even talk through a few minor issues before getting started (like how the air hose was loose, which prevented air from coming out of the brush); including stuff that might actually happen to a normal person trying it themselves.\nThe kicker? This was all spurred on as a gift for their sister. Wholesome! Animal Crossing is so ubiquitous (especially after New Horizons) that I feel like you could theoretically give anyone a gift of something based out of this universe and they'd appreciate it.\nCustom Animal Crossing sneakers tutorial:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3T6sic_F4T8\nThe post These custom painted Animal Crossing sneakers are fire appeared first on Destructoid.",

Ghost Recon Frontline was a battle royale take on the franchise unveiled last October. It boasted 100+ player matches and was positioned as Ubisoft's next big live-service title. Outside of a planned closed beta that never came to pass, Frontline never had a release window, and the game was heavily criticized by fans who wanted a more traditional Ghost Recon experience. You can watch the reveal trailer below. \n\n\nSplinter Cell VR was revealed in September 2020, and it was to be a brand-new Splinter Cell title made from the ground up for virtual reality. The game hadn’t made much of a peep since then. Assassin’s Creed VR, which was revealed alongside it, still seems to be happening, though. \nUbisoft CFO Frederick Duguet told investors that canceling these titles and the two announced projects was a cost-cutting measure to emphasize “even more focus on our biggest development opportunities.\" \nWhat do you think of these cancellations?

According to The Verge, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot explained in the earnings call that the company plans to make the Avatar franchise a larger gaming brand and that, in regards to Frontiers of Pandora, “It is important for us that we come with something that is perfect.”\nUbisoft had been quiet on Frontiers of Pandora since its big reveal during E3 2021, but it was assumed the game would launch sometime this holiday to coincide with the December 16 theatrical premiere of Avatar: The Way of Water. The first-person action game is built in the Snowdrop Engine, and players control a Na’vi in a new area of Pandora called the Western Frontier.

          "description": "Dragon Ball: The Breakers offers a unique spin on the franchise by letting a team of players work together to evade a player-controlled villain in asymmetrical fashion. A new trailer puts on a spotlight on one of those baddies, Lord Frieza, while also confirming an October launch date. \nFor those unaware, The Breakers tasks a team of non-superhuman civilians (including Bulma and Oolong) with escaping the clutches of a powerful mastermind who has imprisoned them in a pocket dimension of sorts. This overseer, known as the Raider, ups the ante by pitting these ordinary captives against powerful antagonists such as Cell, Majin Buu, and, of course, Frieza. The townsfolk can work together or separately to escape to a time machine by using various tools and can apparently harness and utilize the abilities of heroes such as Goku. \nThe new trailer highlights Frieza, showing how players can rain destruction as the emperor of the universe. This player can assume all of Frieza’s traditional transformations (his Golden form is unconfirmed) and unleash attacks such as his planet-destroying Death Ball. He even “Krillins” a victim by pulling them into the air and blowing them up. \n\n\nDragon Ball: The Breakers continues to look as wild as it does humorous, which certainly falls in line with the franchise. It’s launching on October 14 for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC. Curious fans will get to try the game beforehand, thanks to a series of closed network tests taking place on the weekend of August 6-7. You can register for that here.",

Shortly after the 1991 launch of the Blue Blur’s debut game on Sega Genesis, his popularity rivaled Nintendo’s behemoth Super Mario franchise. However, much like the roller coasters that inspired Sonic’s original gameplay and level design, the subsequent decades included plenty of highs and lows. Even after a quick jump off the starting line, many feared the series was doomed to fall short of its potential forever.\nHowever, the brand has experienced something of a renaissance in recent years. The Sonic the Hedgehog franchise is perhaps nearly as popular now as when it burst onto the scene just over three decades ago, bolstered by blockbuster movies, beloved comics, and promising streaming shows. Sonic Mania proved a successful retro reinvention, but the core development staff at Sonic Team has yet to deliver the final piece of the puzzle: a mainline game restoring the series’ legacy as one of the premier platformers.\nSega and Sonic Team think they have that final component with Sonic Frontiers. I traveled to Burbank, California, the American headquarters of Sonic Team, to sink hours into the upcoming open-world game to see if it truly is the fresh direction the franchise needs.\nRead more...",

Players can spacewalk on exterior walkways on their ship, which will provide views of the denser, more varied asteroid fields. Constructing manufacturing facilities lets players produce food and other resources, and you can construct other massive structures upon your capital ship. Perhaps the coolest of all is the ability to collect dreadnaught-sized aliens known as living frigates. Check out the trailer below for a glimpse of these features and others. \n\n\nEndurance goes live today in all versions of No Man’s Sky.

These versions take advantage of their more powerful homes by boasting sharper HD visuals, improved framerates, and faster loading. \n\n\nNo More Heroes 3 first arrived on Switch in August 2021. Former GI editor John Carson scored the game a 7.75 out of 10, writing in his review: \n“My time with No More Heroes 3 jumped between the short highs from entertaining bosses and cutscenes to long, ugly stretches in the world. Much of the design is dated, and I wanted to drop it after a few bosses to avoid the mundanity, but I’m happy I saw it to completion. There are many fun moments, and I love how unafraid it is to be strange or referential. Those who are already invested in the tale of Travis Touchdown should be right at home in this new No More Heroes. Still, I’d insist newcomers try out previous entries before diving into this Garden of Insanity.”",

Mobs of people roamed cities and parks, disrupting traffic in the name of finding the next Pokémon needed to inch closer towards a completed Poké Dex. While the mainstream fervor surrounding Niantic's smash hit has settled significantly, it's still one of the most popular mobile titles in the app stores, surpassing $6 billion in revenue last month. \nThe Pokémon Trading Card Game has recently released special collections commemorating the 25th anniversary of the franchise, the Detective Pikachu movie, and plenty more, but it feels long overdue for Pokémon Go to finally get an expansion devoted to it. That changed this month, as the Pokémon Trading Card Game finally released a special collaboration with the popular mobile title. The expansion is not available through standard booster packs, instead offering boosters exclusively through Elite Trainer Boxes, Battle Decks, Collections, and Tins.\nWe were sent several boxes of this special expansion. As I opened the cards, I noticed the cards tend to feature more Pokémon from Gen I than other generations, which makes sense given the game's peak popularity. That said, various cards I pulled featured Pokémon like Tyranitar, Dragonite, and Blissey, who have, at one point, stood atop the in-game meta of Pokémon Go. It's nice to see those homages, alongside the most iconic Pokémon, the human characters from Pokémon Go, and items like Egg Incubators, Lure Modules, and PokéStops, which are essential parts of the mobile game. This pack also features peel-away Ditto cards, Pokémon exploring photorealistic settings, and Radiant Pokémon. And of course, there's Meltan and Melmetal, who both debuted through Pokémon Go.\nYou can see the large collection of my favorite pulls from this expansion in the gallery below.\n\nThe Pokémon Trading Card Game: Pokémon Go expansion launched on July 1. For all things Pokémon Trading Card Game, head to our special hub by clicking on the banner below!",

Waterproof Studios/SC Productions, Kinetic Media, and Bardel Entertainment are also attached to help produce in association with Obsidian and Xbox.\nDeadline reports that the series, like the game, stars four friends who discover shrinking technology that zaps them to mere inches tall. The teenagers must now survive in a backyard laden with dangerous insects, spiders, and other threats while unraveling a corporate conspiracy threatening the town.\n\"The team at Obsidian have created an incredible world that has already grabbed the attention of the gaming community,\" says Carl Whiteside of MD, WP/SC Productions. \"We are excited to work with our incredible partners to bring the story to life in an animated series.\"\nThe Grounded series has no announced cast, release window, or streaming platform.

But where did this new twisted tale come from? Join us as we sit down with the horror master himself to discuss the origins of developer Striking Distance Studios' first game and show off some brand new gameplay as well!\n\n\nMarcus Stewart and Alex Stadnik are here to grill Glen on the title's origins. A few years after his departure from Activision, the CEO, and founder of Striking Distance Studios found himself in the desert, painting and trying to figure out what the next step in his career would be. That led him to Callisto and his brand new studio. But how long did it take him to form the story structure? Did he always know how the game would end? You'll just have to watch the video to find out.\nOn top of the Callisto origin story, we're also showing off some brand new gameplay. Protagonist Jacob Lee traverses the harrowing hallways of Jupiter's dead moon, fending off the terrifying Biophage at every step. We also get a fresh look at the satisfying and devastating shotgun and how it tears through those who would do you harm.\nIf you want to learn more about The Callisto Protocol ahead of its December 2 release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, be sure to head over to our exclusive cover hub below, where you'll find our preview impressions, the GI cover reveal, and more looks at the game.

          "description": "A new game based on the film Aliens is in the works by developer Survios in partnership with 20th Century Games.\nSurvios primarily develops VR titles and is perhaps best known as the team behind Creed: Rise to Glory. The studio describes the untitled project as a single-player “immersive action horror game,” and it’s being made for PC, console, and VR. The game's website states that it's developed using Unreal Engine 5 and has an original story that takes place between Alien and Aliens \"where a battle hardened veteran has a vendetta against the Xenomorphs.\"\nThere’s no trailer or screenshots, but Survios says we’ll learn more about the game on July 21 during San Diego Comic-Con at the “Alien: Expanding a Dark and Frightening Universe” panel.\nThis project is unrelated to Aliens: Dark Descent, the Aliens tactical shooter, announced during Summer Game Fest last month. Survios is hiring for positions on the title, suggesting it’s still very early in development. As such, it has no release window, but hopefully, we’ll get a better idea of what it entails during Comic-Con.",

          "description": "Sony is rolling out its first-ever PlayStation-focused loyalty program called PlayStation Stars. In a blog post by Grace Chen, vice president of network advertising, loyalty & licensed merchandise, she explains that PlayStation Stars is a free program that rewards points by completing “campaigns” and challenges while playing games. \nAccording to Chen, earning points may require you to “win tournaments, earn specific trophies, or even be the first player to platinum a blockbuster title in your local time zone.” PlayStation Stars will also have a “monthly check-in” campaign that players fulfill simply by playing a game. \nYou can redeem points on rewards that may include PSN wallet funds or select PS Store products. Users also subscribed to PlayStation Plus gain the added benefit of automatically earning loyalty points for making purchases.\nLoyalty points can also be spent on “digital collectibles.\" Examples described in the post are digital figurines of game characters or old PlayStation devices. These collectibles will evidently come in various rarities, with Chen stating players will always have “ultra rare” collectibles to chase. \nThese collectibles may sound like NFTs, but they’re not. As Chen adamantly explains in a Washington Post interview, these digital items can’t be traded or sold and PlayStation Stars does not utilize blockchain technology in any way.  \n“It’s definitely not NFTs. Definitely not” says Chen.\nPlayStation Stars will gradually roll out across different regions sometime later this year. What do you think of this new loyalty program? Let us know in the comments!",

The purchased studio will focus on developing visual content for Nintendo's various IPs. \nAccording to Eurogamer, it's unusual for Nintendo to acquire companies despite its recent SRD and Next-Level Games deals. Moreover, Nintendo Pictures' – Dynamo was a production company behind several animated Pikmin shorts – work will be separate from Illumination, the animation studio behind the upcoming Super Mario Bros. Movie. Official documentation of the purchase states: \n\"Nintendo has decided to acquire 100% of the outstanding shares (excluding treasury shares) of Dynamo Pictures and make it a wholly owned subsidiary to strengthen the planning and production structure of visual content in the Nintendo group. The Acquisition is expected to close on October 3, 2022…[and] will have only a minor effect on Nintendo's results for this fiscal year.\"\nWhat animated Nintendo projects are you looking forward to?

While certain games like Shadow the Hedgehog, Sonic the Hedgehog (2006), Sonic and the Black Knight, and Sonic Forces have experimented with new combat mechanics for the games' protagonists to use, Sonic Frontiers looks to evolve that gameplay component in unprecedented ways.\nWhen Sonic Team set out to create Sonic Frontiers, it wanted to give players more freedom with which to operate.

We knew that the action romp would come exclusively to Switch this year, but today Nintendo announced an October 28 release date with an appropriately over-the-top trailer. \n\n\nPlatinum Games' enemy and hero designs for the franchise remain stunning. Bayonetta sports butterfly wings and tentacled horns in some action sequences, while enemies take the form of armored animals – homunculi, artificial bioweapons. You'll fire canons from a moving train in a ravaged cityscape, ride grotesque crabs up skyscrapers, and even play as the new katana-wielding witch-in-training, Viola. And let's not forget that you can summon an all-powerful kaiju too. It's all wild and nonsensical as you'd expect but in the best possible way. \n\nBayonetta 3 ups the ante on Switch this October 28. A Trinity Masquerade Edition of the game will also be available, boasting a 200-page art book. More details for the special version of the game will be revealed later.",

Kirby’s Dream Buffet pits friends against each other in a platforming, snack-devouring race.\nOne to four players roll their Kirby through four rounds of food-themed obstacle courses, and whoever collects the most strawberries by the end wins. As seen in the trailer, players can use new cuisine-inspired copy abilities to gain the upper hand. That includes morphing into a cupcake that vacuums multiple food items or turning into sentient chocolate bars to perform Kirby’s signature rock slam. \n\n\nKirby’s Dream Buffet supports local and online multiplayer and will be sold digitally and at retail for an unannounced price.",
