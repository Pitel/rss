Obviously I can't actually respond to that, so I'll just do the bad news first and if you chose differently you can always tip your monitor upside down, hang from the ceiling, or just work your way up the article from the bottom: tributary horror demake Bloodborne PSX is no more. As reported by The Verge (thanks PC Gamer), LW Media's Lilith Walther has received a copyright takedown notice from firm MarkScan on behalf of Sony Interactive, accusing Bloodborne PSX of 'digital piracy'. The game was previously available on Itch for three years without issue.\nThis follows a recent DMCA takedown of a YouTube video promoting Bloodborne PSX, as chronicled by noted good modsman Lance McDonald below. As McDonald mentions, MarkScan were also responsible for another recent strike against his own 60fps Bloodborne mod, which had been available without issue since 2021.\nRead more",

Yet beyond the sparkling glamour of marketing slides, however, path tracing remains exceptionally niche: nearly six years since Quake II RTX served as the tech’s de facto gaming debut, you can still count the number of compatible games on your fingers. Compare and contrast with the dozens upon dozens of games that have embraced ray tracing, path tracing’s less demanding nephew, and you’ll likely start wondering why more game devs don’t go for it.\nWe’re not here to answer that, though. This is Should You Bother With, here to investigate whether you should start using path traced effects to give your games – some of them, anyway – the full maxed-out-visuals treatment.

          "description": "True to the word of Capcom’s German social media marketing, Monster Hunter Wilds has a new, generally less extravagant set of PC system requirements ahead of its February 28th launch. There’s also a standalone benchmark tool that you can download from the game’s Steam page, so you can see for yourself how the beast-biffing RPG will run on your hardware.\nIn theory, these are great developments. Lower requirements mean a more widely accessible game, and the benchmark tool – which covers a good six minutes of combined cinematics and simulated free roaming – brings reassurance and accountability to this otherwise hype-reliant prerelease period. Sadly, there are two problems. One, the benchmark confirms outright that Monster Hunter Wilds will run like stagnant goulash on low-end PCs, and two, it does so to the extent that I’m not sure that the revised minimum specs are even reliable.\nRead more",

This ends the fight immediately. Sometimes I resort to this low move out of frustration, when a dull fight has dragged on for too long. Sometimes I resort to it out of panic, because I’ve accidentally set fire to every hard surface within ten feet, or frozen myself to a wall. Often it’s just for the pleasure of it. \r\n\nIn Eternal Strands, Yellow Brick Games’ debut title, you play the leader of a \"weaver band\", a crew of freelance magicians, in a world where something extremely bad happened to magic. Some years ago, the Enclave, a city state acting as the isolationist heart of the world’s magic, exploded in a kind of power surge - one part tsunami, one part blown fuse - and just as quickly sealed itself off from the world outside. Somehow managing to breach the wall, your band finds themselves the first people to set foot inside the ruined capital since the calamity and sets about uncovering the mystery of what exactly went wrong. \r\n\n \nRead more",

That's a misdemeanour that usually carries up to one year prison time, but he's \"hoping to escape the prison term in exchange for 150 hours of community service in support of wildfire relief and the approximately $65,000 USD it cost to repair the plane,\" write Eurogamer, as part of a plea agreement.\nRead more",

He's co-developing this with Evil Gingerbread Studio but his other big project is the Total War: Warhammer III overhaul mod SFO, and it seems barely a month passes without some huge update to that. Venris once told me he mods for around \"eight to 12 hours a day\", though, so I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that this cult-shepherding roguelite is now available in Steam early access. Edwin described it as \"Darkest Dungeon, but you're running the dungeon\". That's better than anything I could come up with, so let's stick with that.\nRead more",

He wouldn't be lying in his very own chamber with its very own hole for shitting in - and in any case, it's more than her job's worth to treat him otherwise.

It is, in fact, a rather nifty collection of upscaling improvements that can help out older graphics cards as readily as the very newest, while building on DLSS 3’s frame generation tool with Multi Frame Generation (MFG) to send visual smoothness skyrocketing. If you care even the slightest iota for how your PC performs in modern games, DLSS 4 demands your attention.\nHere, then, I’ll break down DLSS 4’s various tricks and components, looking at how they really affect performance – and whether it’s worth upgrading your rig to maximise compatibility with it.\nRead more",

Well, part of a poem. Both to free up room on the disc and perhaps, to edit out \"the vast sorrows and all the vexations\" of the second half, only the first two stanzas appear. The recording in fact ends halfway through a line, which conjures up an intriguing problem for the listener, inasmuch as the thwarted rhyme scheme reveals that the piece is incomplete. A poetically-minded alien might be tempted to fill in the gap. A fancier alien who took a module in postmodernism might hail the poetics of the fragment. A resolutely practical alien who thinks poetry is for losers might read the whole thing, instead, as a set of incoherent navigational prompts, made up of loose prepositions - au-dessus, au-dessus, par delà, par delà.\r\n \nRead more",

Happily, all these ray tracing and frame generation accoutrements seemingly won’t preclude Spidey 2 from working on older, slower PCs as well, as the minimum specs are surprisingly reasonable.\nGranted, they’re only rated for 30fps at a lowly 720p, and you’ll still need to find a honking 140GB of SSD space, but the basic GPU and CPU requirements aren’t too lofty at all. The likes of an RTX 3060 for 60fps/1080p are quite reasonable as well, though you’re staring down the barrel of Nvidia’s pricey RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 cards for high-rez ray tracing.\nRead more",

Which is to say, somebody's finally made a video game version of Hex, the sentient glass hive from Terry Pratchett's Unseen University. In spooky automation-driven strategy sim Microtopia, you manage a swarm of what could either be ants who've been to the ripperdoc, or PC components who've grown legs and antennae. Your goal is to expand an insect colony that is also a motherboard, where glittering pheromone trails double as silicon circuits.\nThe developers Cordyceps Collective have just announced a release date - February 18th - and what's this, there's a demo as well?

It's a single-button affair, having you navigate levels by alternating a pivot-point on a shape I don't know the name of so I'm just going to call a spinny stick.\nThere are moving background elements in some stages - in others, you make your own pace. Except I can't really make my own pace, can I Bauhaus Bonk? Because the swing soundtrack makes me feel like a plodding buffoon if I'm not responding with appropriate gusto. This is entrapment, game.

I know some of you are old enough to know what a letter opener is, or even to own one. Statistically, most of the RPS readership are Lich Lords. The Maw letter opener differs from regular letter openers in that when you open a letter with it, you will encounter not a letter but a perfect copy of yourself opening a letter in the opposite direction. The two of you must now fight to the death to decide who is the letter-opener and who is the letter. It's yours for a piffling three pints of any available body fluid, but if you don't want to buy a letter opener you can always buy one of this week's new PC games instead.\r\n \nRead more",

In fairness to Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, which Nic says can be great as a game per se, it does make some effort at settling into Windows. It has rebindable M+K controls. It has DLSS. It has generally more consistent framerates than FFXVI, which could bait you in with silky visuals before grabbing your head and shoving it into the cold ice bath of sub-30fps.\nYet it also steps back from that game on its supported tech, while raising its hardware requirements so far above Final Fantasy 7 Remake that it won’t even launch on a lot of older graphics cards. Even so, hitching and microstuttering issues from FF7 Remake return once more, along with plenty of other signs that this PC version didn’t get the love that a lot of other erstwhile PlayStation exclusives – like Horizon Forbidden West or God of War Ragnarök – did for their ports.\nRead more",

If you tried to play any Roblox games in the past hour or so, like Blue Lock Rivals or Jujutsu Infinite, you may have failed to connect or even received an error when trying to do so. According to the official Roblox Service Status, this was due to an unexpected service disruption. Parents, rest easy! Not all hope is lost.\n\n\nIs Roblox down?\n\n\nNo, Roblox does not appear to be down. Even though the Roblox servers went down at around 6:20 pm EST on February 10, 2025, they came back online roughly 45 minutes later at around 7:05 pm EST. Officially, Roblox confirmed that as of 7:04 pm EST the Roblox service had been restored and they would continue to monitor to ensure stability. We tried connecting to four different games just now without issue.\n\n\n\n\n\nDid Roblox go down on February 10?\n\n\nYes, the Roblox servers suffered a service disruption on the evening of February 10, 2025. According to Roblox, the team was alerted to an issue preventing players and users from using the platform at around 6:22 pm EST. About 15 minutes later, they identified the issue and began resolving it to restabilize the servers. Then again about 30 minutes later, the servers were fixed and access was restored.\n\n\nIf your kids suddenly stopped complaining, then that's why. The young ones should no longer have issues connecting to Roblox. \n\n\nAs for now, it appears that all three components on Roblox (User, Player, and Creator) across all platforms are currently operational and the servers are live and without issues. As such, you should be able to connect to Roblox without any errors.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe post Kids suddenly bored and restless? Yes, Roblox is down. appeared first on Destructoid.",

If you're here, you're probably wondering the exact time it will drop, and we're here to show you what to expect.\n\n\nAvowed Early Access Release Time, explained\n\n\nAccording to the Xbox app, Avowed Early Access begins on Feb. 13, 2025, at 10 a.m. PST/1 p.m. EST/6 p.m. GMT. It'll be available to play on PC and Xbox Series X|S, as long you already bought the Premium Edition. If you're planning on playing the game solely through the Xbox Game Pass, you'll need to wait until Feb. 18 for Avowed's full launch date.\n\n\nGame Pass users can still partake in Early Access when buying the Premium Upgrade Edition for $29.99. Not only does the pack include five-day Early Access, but it also offers two Premium Skin Packs for each of your companions. Use the skin packs to deck out characters like Kai, Marius, Yatzli, and Giatta. You can also check out the Avowed Digital Artbook and the original soundtrack to experience the game in its entirety.\n\n\nImage via Obsidian Entertainment\n\n\nOnce Avowed Early Access commences, you'll embark on a journey to the Living Lands, a breathtaking realm tainted by a devastating plague. It's your mission to unearth the roots of this darkness using the game's innovative combat system. Unlike many RPGs that confine you to a single class, this game empowers you to wield a diverse range of powers. You can brandish a traditional sword in one hand while the other wields a magical grimoire or experiment with a variety of other weapons.\n\n\nHaving had the privilege of a sneak peek during my Avowed preview, I can attest that it's a spectacle to behold. The sheer number of possibilities in both your defense and offense strategies is unlike anything I've seen before. So, if you're eager to experience it for yourself, get ready for its Early Access launch this week.\n\nThe post What Time Does Avowed Release in Early Access? appeared first on Destructoid.",

This certainly makes the CAM item a good bargain choice for beginners.\n\n\nIf you want to spend more fodder and obtain top-tier meta items, both the Fernando Torres and Andrea Pirlo Future Stars Icons are great choices.

Here’s how you can access the Type // CC Trello and Discord.\n\n\nType // CC Trello Trello & Discord \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nHere’s a list of all Type // CC community channels:\n\n\n\nOfficial Type // CC Trello\n\n\nType // CC Discord Server \n\n\nVendetta Type // CC Official Roblox Group\n\n\n\nLet’s face it, you most likely won’t be happy with what you’ve rolled for the first couple times, so don’t hesitate to dip into our Type // C codes as well. Generally, I’d advise you to pay the most attention to the Trello board. The community is surprisingly efficient in moderating itself, and the squeaky-clean overview will present no issues. In short, you’ll be able to find info about:\n\n\n\nAll three races and their progression \n\n\nDifferent items you can roll when creating a character\n\n\nAccessories\n\n\nClasses\n\n\nRaids/Lore Events\n\n\nBosses\n\n\nArchived content \n\n\n\nIf you were wondering about the Discord server, it’s, truth be told, a bit chaotic. Nevertheless, the Type // CC hivemind will be quick to jump on any questions you might have about the game. Mods try to segment different conversations, but everything inevitably gravitates around general chat. \n\n\nI love how the server is a database in and of itself, containing info about everything from announcements and giveaways, to faction news, hunts, challenges, boss sightings and so much more. Check out the Discord server at least weekly to keep up with all the changes. \n\n\nI guess that’s it for today’s Type // CC Trello guide.

Mělo to mít nějakou jinou \"message\" než \"když jsi psychopatický gangster, špatně dopadneš\"? Ale docela to uteklo. Jednoznačné mínus a nechtěný (zřejmě?) humor tkví ve skutečnosti, že hlavní hrdinka (t.j. žena) pořád vypadá jako nabušený chlap v paruce a během celého filmu to žádné jiné postavě nepřijde divné.
