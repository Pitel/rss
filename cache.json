A brief synopsis (found below) suggests that the series will be sticking relatively close to the source material, but for a game so defined by its mechanics, there really is room for the story to go anywhere.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Splish-splashing its way onto Switch in stunning watercolour is Dordogne, a nostalgic kayak trip down the metaphorical river of life – and also down the literal river of Dordogne in the south of France. Umanimation, the production company behind the game, specialises in “transmedia universes”, its previous works including a web series and a VR short film. This, its first video game project, combines the airy sweeps of gorgeous watercolours with all the button-pressing fun of gaming - and does so to deliver a deeply touching rumination on loss.\nThe story focuses on Mimi and her paternal grandmother Nora. When Mimi is in her early 30s, Nora passes away leaving behind a letter telling Mimi to visit her old house in the French region of Dordogne. Mimi’s father Fabrice has been feuding with Nora for as long as Mimi can remember. She doesn’t know why, but it dates back to a childhood summer visit to her grandmother’s house. She has hazy, happy memories of the holiday, but also suffers from a mental block. Thus is established an emotive mystery wrapped up in halcyon, sun-drenched memories.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Everywhere you go, there are grey skyscrapers touching the clouds, so they all look like the concrete's puffing on numerous cigarettes. More often than not, cracked paving gives way to an empty lot or a vacuous car park, often with one guy slumped in a little booth ensuring it stays as grey as possible. So, what better way to commemorate grey than with a look at its president, Armored Core 6: Fires Of Rubicon?\nHaving seen a 20 minute presentation of the game at this year's Summer Game Fest, I'd say it struck me as an action game through and through, with the most recognisable bits of Souls soldered onto it when it came to, say, tough battles set to erratic rhythms. Honestly, I would say the hands-off demo is exactly what I expected it to be: lots of fast bits of metal slamming into each other in what was, perhaps, the least surprising FromSoftware reveal I've seen. Here's a piecemeal, slightly chaotic breakdown of the whole experience, coming to you from the frazzled mind of a jetlagged man sitting at a wobbly table.\nRead more",

As you'll have seen from my big preview, the game itself is a 2.5D platformer that mixes 3D character models and environments with sidescrolling action and dramatic camera movements as hero Sargon doles out his suite of special attacks. But as I was playing I became curious whether the team had ever experimented with going all-in on the anime visuals to create a more illustrated look akin to their excellent Rayman games.

Todd Howard wasn't even wearing a leather jacket, which sort of felt like seeing Scooby Doo without his dog collar. Like, I'd still know it's Scooby Doo, but it wouldn't look right, you know? \nAnyway, all this is to say that the presentation was long. If you're still interested in finding out what was revealed but don't have the time to watch it, however, then good news! I have created a shorter video that highlights the 12 most exciting new details Bethesda showcased as part of the Starfield direct. That's cool, isn't it? Who needs Todd Howard when you can listen to me, a tired man wearing an unironed t-shirt, telling you about the game instead.\nRead more",

This is a great price for a card that makes a brilliant upgrade from something like a GTX 1060, RX 570 or RX 580, providing significantly better rasterised performance (up to 2x as fast) while also providing those features that weren't available a few generations ago.

So, having seen roughly 30 minutes of Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora, I can give you the unfettered lowdown of a person who's analysed it with a cold, hard stare. In brief, the game looks rather lovely! If… too lovely. I worry there's a big catch somewhere and I can't put my finger on it.\nRead more",

If only there was a way to get my brain to remember which obstacles were where... Happily, Prince Of Persia: The Lost Crown has an ingenious solution. Aside from shaping up to be one of the best platformers I've played in ages, it also has a very neat feature that lets you pin screenshots to your map screen, meaning you'll never have to pointlessly backtrack ever again. \nRead more",

          "description": "After its big reveal at Summer Game Fest on Thursday, the internet has not taken kindly to Ubisoft's new Prince Of Persia game. There have been reports that The Lost Crown's gameplay reveal trailer (which currently sits across five separate YouTube channels) is continuing to rack up significantly higher dislikes than likes since it got announced, and many seem to have taken issue with the trailer's accompanying rap song and that it doesn't look like a \"true\" Prince Of Persia game, whatever the heck that means. It's disappointing to see a game instantly dismissed like this, not least because, as someone who's actually been to Ubisoft Montpellier to play the damn thing, this is arguably the most exciting Prince Of Persia game in years - and certainly more interesting than the troubled Sands Of Time Remake. \nRead more",

It remains unconcerned with telling groundbreaking stories or delivering breathtaking cinema in its fights - it doesn't care.

I'd got my pass, got seated in the theatre and finally had a chance to take in my surroundings. There were lots of folks, obviously, either excitedly chatting or awkwardly swivelling their legs to let people pass. Many wore Xbox jerseys. One man had an Xbox logo shaved into his head. A photographer asked our section to smile, so I managed the pained grin of a British person who encounters a stranger on a walk, the bunching of my cheeks pulling my lips into a curl. Meanwhile, those dressed in their Microsoft jerseys crossed their forearms and hollered.\nThe countdown flashed up on screen and the crowd started chanting, \"five, four, three!\", and for a second it felt like I was the only one who hadn't supped from a bowl of green liquid or beat my chest to the rhythm of \"Play it day one on Xbox Game Pass\". The crowd was on another plane of existence and, for brief moments, I was there with them. At other times I felt the physical fatigue of the trailer train more acutely than ever.\nRead more",

          "description": "Ahead of the launch of its Steam Next Fest demo next week, I've been playing a substantial early build of Mimimi Games' latest stealth strategy game, Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew. After delighting us with Edo-period Japan in Shadow Tactics: Blades Of The Shogun and the rootin' tootin' tales of the Wild West in Desperados 3, Mimimi have taken a firm step outside their comfort zone with the high seas island-hopping of Shadow Gambit, offering up an altogether different approach to their tried and tested stealth antics. \nAs you might have guessed from the name, its eponymous crew aren't bound by the laws of reality in this latest tactical outing, and their extensive suite of magic abilities really open up the playing field for some creative takedowns. But the canvas on which you're painting these elaborate murders has morphed since the days of Desperados 3, with its handful of islands now offering multiple points of entry, a myriad of different missions and objectives and - for the first time ever - repeat visits to the same locations. It's quite the sea change from Mimimi's previous work, but rest assured: the crown jewels of the Mimimi stealth strategy experience certainly haven't been lost to Davey Jones' locker in the process. If nothing else, this is the most fun I've had with a Mimimi game, period - and I cannot wait to dive back in properly when it launches on August 17th. \nRead more",

An improvement on the creators found in previous Bethesda games, there's nothing here that looks particularly innovative compared to other open-world games of this ilk.

It is not a spin-off I would have expected. Exo Rally Championship is an off-road rally racing game where you'll zoom across exoplanets in a six-wheeled car with manoeuvring thrusters. Soar over low-gravity worlds! Dodge through a meteor shower! Gasp at the pretty landscapes! Have a look in the trailer below.\nRead more",

Announced during the Xbox Game Showcase at this year's not-E3, Towerborne looks much more family-friendly.

          "description": "MMO raids can be some of the most satisfying experiences in multiplayer gaming, so it's a shame that they're so often one of the last things you gain access to after a whole lot of time and grinding. That makes me very interested in 33 Immortals, the newly announced next game from Jotun and Spiritfarer studio Thunder Lotus. It's a 33-player cooperative action roguelikelike which they say offers \"ultra-fast runs through a streamlined distillation of the MMO raid experience,\" with \"pick-up and raid\" matchmaking.

Star Wars Outlaws is, being an Ubi game, an open world adventure where you play as Kay Vess - the Han-Solo-but-a-girl I reference in my headline - and Kay's best alien pal Nix \"as they attempt one of the greatest heists the Outer Rim has ever seen.\" Outlaws was revealed tonight at the Xbox Games Showcase with a trailer that had an extended opening metaphor bit about gambling that was trite enough for me to assume it was a trailer for the Quantic Dream Star Wars game.

Následky jsou podobné jako na začátku roku v kauze \"cz.nic zablokoval doménu T-Mobile\". Nedostupnost části jejich dns je nyní údajně způsobena DDoS útokem. Opět tedy nefungují dns servery vedené pod nextra.cz. Firmy, které u nich mají vedenou doménu, mohou očekávat nedostupnost svých služeb, uvíznutí na globálních emailových aj. blacklistech apod. Horší snad je jen to, že to vypadá (není potvrzeno, jen se to tak z hlediska timeline jeví), že o nedostupnosti části svých služeb se dozvěděli až od zákazníků.",

While the Sands of Time remake is still cooking, the series is going back to its 2D roots with The Lost Crown, an Ubisoft Montpellier project. And after playing a small slice of it, I'm pretty excited about the full game.\nThe Lost Crown feels like it pays homage to the foundation of Prince of Persia. The player takes up the role of Sargon, a new character who's part of an elite band of warriors looking for the kidnapped Prince Ghassan. In the demo I played as part of Ubisoft's presence in Los Angeles during Summer Game Fest 2023, I got a fairly good look at how Sargon's journey plays out. There's a whole lot of running, jumping, parrying, and plenty of spikes to dodge.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3qsC…",

While the video mostly centers on poster boy Luke, (portrayed by Johnny Junkers), and a busy day in the life of a street fighter, we also get appearances from Chun-Li (Caytie Cosplay), Zangief (Bane Armstrong), Cammy (Vamplettes), and Kimberly (Jahara Jayde - No Pout).\nD Piddy themselves also takes to the floor as the tonic-gushing vigilante, Jamie.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjR_iqxgZbY\nLuke's day is busy enough, but it's thrown into full chaos by the arrival of Juri Han (Jane Sin), which leads to a brief throwdown between pals. Additionally, Manon (Kitty Kaboom) does a spot of couture shopping, and even Sakura (Lucky Lai) pops her head up to remind Capcom she needs to be added as DLC. The whole shebang is backed by the official Street Fighter 6 theme song \"Not on the Sidelines\" by Rocco 808 & Randy Marx.\nCheck it out, a lot of wonderful, creative talent on display.\nYou can keep up to speed on more of D Piddy's projects over on their official Twitter.\nStreet Fighter 6 is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms. Be sure to check out our newly launched and ever-growing guide hub for hints and tips on all of the game’s main modes, as well as my thoughts on who needs to join the roster post-launch.\nThe post Rad Street Fighter 6 cosplay video sees World Warriors duke it out appeared first on Destructoid.",

Before the Atari VCS (2600) console even launched, founder Nolan Bushnell sold the business to Warner Communications, which fired him shortly thereafter. It’s traded hands throughout the years, eventually landing with Infogrames in 2000, who gradually rebranded to the Atari name before nearly becoming bankrupt in 2013. They restructured, sold off a number of assets, and managed to come out of bankruptcy.\nSay what you will about the Atari Lynx and Jaguar platforms, but nothing is as bad as post-bankruptcy protection Atari.

As with its predecessor, death is only beginning, and each fallen knight will be replaced by the next in their bloodline, many of whom carry their own unique quirks and abilities, known in-game as \"Traits\".\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiHeilA8k4U&ab_channel=CellarDoorGames\nAdded to the sequel are several new features, including the Metroidvania-type \"Heirlooms\", allowing access to certain out-of-reach areas, and an expanded narrative that runs beyond the original run and into several New Game+ efforts. While the sequel is obviously over a year old, it's a truly golden title, and well worth checking out by all adventure fans, regardless of your experience with the roguelike genre or the Rogue Legacy franchise.

The Animation Digital Network will be co-producing. Right now, we have a short teaser trailer of the prisoner sitting on a pile of corpses attempting to spark their head back to life. This comes complete with the sound of someone flicking a cheap lighter.\nhttps://twitter.com/motiontwin/status/1668982072797454338?s=20\nThat’s not much to go on, admittedly, but despite being a roguelite, Dead Cells has a lot of lore to draw from. It also has a lot of memorable characters to draw from, like, uh, that one lady who dies. Or maybe that guy who… Crap.\nI’m going to be honest with you. I picked up Dead Cells for their Return to Castlevania DLC, and I loved the heck out of it. Once I finished with Return to Castlevania, it was my intention to continue on through the rest of the content. I guess it was a busy time for me because I just didn’t do that. When was that? March? Oh, yeah. I did 12 reviews that month. That wasn’t a very good idea.\nHowever, my time spent with it does leave me convinced that it could be adapted into a very watchable animated series. No word on whether or not you have to start from the beginning if you fail to watch the series from start to finish.\nThe Dead Cells animated series will arrive sometime in 2024. The show will premiere exclusively on French network ADN, before screening worldwide.\nThe post Dead Cells is getting an animated series in 2024 appeared first on Destructoid.",

BPM Rush will task players with battling wave after wave of increasingly tough opponents, with bonus points awards for synching the battle to the beat. Stay on your toes, however, as the BPM will increase with each and every wave, and only the most rhythmic melee warriors will be able to keep the pace in this unique-looking endurance test.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dU394xpvU\nThe second mode Power Up! Tower Up! is a variant of Hi-Fi Rush's Rhythm Tower mode, and adds a slew of power-ups and bugs to the battle. Chai will be able to select from a variety of buffs and nerfs between rounds at the cost (or increase of) their score multipliers and other bonuses. Essentially, it is up to the player to increase their powers in exchange for a higher score, or to conversely reduce their own abilities for the big, big numbers.\nIn addition to the two modes, new challenges arrive that will reward players with clothing for Chai and Korsica, new poses and filters for Photo Mode, and all-new special attacks that see an assist from robo-friendos CNMN and Smidge. Get by with a little help from you friends indeed. You can check out all of this cool content for free when the Hi-Fi Rush Arcade Challenge update drops on July 5.\nHi-Fi Rush is available now on PC, Xbox, and Xbox Game Pass.\nThe post New modes coming to Hi-Fi Rush in Arcade Challenge update appeared first on Destructoid.",

If you managed to check out, and enjoy, the showcases that have been broadcasting recently, you may well be excited for SGF's return in 2024. Actually, the event is even technically over yet, as Annapurna's showcase is still to come.\nNot only is Keighley eager to announce that Summer Game Fest will be back in June of next year, he goes on to say that this year's event was \"record-setting.\" Not quite certain what that means, but it likely refers to the amount of people who attended the event, both in person and online. Given the dry spell from gaming conventions over the past two or three years, it wouldn't be surprising to see the likes of SGF see an uptick in attendees.\nhttps://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1668638357608628225\nCurrently, there are no details about the 2024 showcases, other than it will obviously be hosted by Keighley himself. There will also be the return of Play Days from studio iam8bit, but again, details won't be announced until further down the line.\nSummer Game Fest 2023 saw a lot of content from a variety of studios, publishers, and industry experts. Trailers from the likes of Alan Wake 2, Mortal Kombat 1, Marvel's Spider-Man 2, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, and lots more were on display. There was also the Day of the Dev event, hosted by iam8bit and Double Fine, which gave indie studios the opportunity to showcase what they've been working on.\nWith E3 being cancelled this year — perhaps never to return — that leaves the space open for SGF and other expos to continue their dominance of the summer period.

The new ports appeared on the official site in a CERO ratings listing, which was then followed by an updated trailer.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RycGltKqjg\nWhile this will hardly come as a surprise to most, there were still many only panicking that perhaps the black-and-blue brand would not be making the return journey to Tartarus. Frankly, this wasn't going to happen, not when there is so much cash to be made, but at least those who were concerned can rest easy that they will be revisiting The Dark Hour with Messrs Makoto, Junpei, Mitsuru, and company.\nFirst leaked during Summer Game Fest, before being officially announced during Sunday's Xbox Game Showcase, Persona 3 Reload is a full remake of the 2006 PS2 classic. While fans have been craving this title for some title, the hype has been somewhat quashed by the revelation that Reload will not feature any of the content from expanded edition Persona 3 FES, nor the Persona 3 Portable release, which included the much-loved female protagonist, known to the community as \"FemC\".\nPersona 3 Reload will launch in early 2024 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

As such, Microsoft cannot complete its purchase of Activision Blizzard until the case reaches Federal Court in August.]\nThe United States Federal Trade Commission has requested that U.S. place an injunction preventing Microsoft from closing its proposed purchase of publisher Activision Blizzard before the FTC's antitrust lawsuit, set to take place this August.\nDespite the legal opposition from the commission, as well as the approval rejection from the UK, The FTC believes Microsoft fully intends to go ahead and complete the $68.7 billion merger, and that \"they may consummate the proposed acquisition at any time\". The FTC filed suit against Microsoft back in December 2022, but the case is still yet to be heard in court.\nThe FTC has asked for an injunction preventing the sale from taking place be filed no later than June 15, and that said injunction remain in place until the court makes its decision later this summer.\nIn a statement to GamesIndustry.biz, Microsoft president Brad Smith writes: \"We welcome the opportunity to present our case in federal court. We believe accelerating the legal process in the U.S. will ultimately bring more choice and competition to the market.\"\nThe FTC continues to build its case against the proposed sale ahead of August's hearing. The commission is expected to present arguments that Microsoft's ownership of the Call of Duty and World of Warcraft studio will create something of a monopoly within the industry, limiting player choice and confining popular brands to MS own platforms. Microsoft has repeatedly denied that this is the intent behind its proposed purchase.\nPretrial briefs are expected to take place in July, with the court officially opening August 2.\nThe post (Update) FTC requests injunction to prevent Microsoft/Activision sale from closing early appeared first on Destructoid.",

Soulcalibur V is not a backward-compatible game for modern platforms, nor is it a part of Xbox Game Pass or PlayStation Plus. As such, the delisting only affects the native PS3/Xbox 360 users. Better hold on to those discs, archivists.\nThe most recent entry in the franchise, Soulcalibur VI, launched in 2018 on PS4, PC, and Xbox One.\nThe post Soulcalibur V is being delisted from digital storefronts next week appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "An added golden epilogue\nIt's been just over a year since Square Enix released its HD-2D turn-based tactics game Triangle Strategy. And now, fans who have put some time into the tactics can get a little bonus for their trouble.\nA Version 1.1.0 update has rolled out for Triangle Strategy on available platforms, adding a few different features. For those who want to re-experience the big events of Triangle Strategy, there are replay options for both chapters and story battles.\nBut also arriving as part of the update is an Extra Story option. This bonus chapter appears on the title screen, but only after you've completed the Serenoa route of Triangle Strategy.\nIf you haven't played the game or have only seen it through once, you might not be aware of this route. The Serenoa route is Triangle Strategy's \"golden route,\" where the protagonist Serenoa finds an option to resolve all the great mysteries and conflicts that surround the ongoing war.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nhTJ-Evv_U\nTo get that, you'll need to make certain choices throughout the game, and be ready to see them through. Doing so will unlock this new extra chapter, which serves as a golden epilogue of sorts.\nReturn to the battlefield\nAlongside content updates, Square Enix also says that some battle adjustments have been made for repeat playthroughs. Other options have been added, that all seem to make repeat playthroughs a bit smoother to run through. It's nice, considering many players who are going for the golden route are likely doing so on a second run.\nI'm happy to see Triangle Strategy get this update, though. It's remained a memorable, solid tactics experience both on the Switch and other platforms. Any sort of follow-up or sequel speculation aside, I'm happy to see the Triangle Strategy team is being given the room to make these post-launch updates so far out, as little treats for fans who dug this far into the game.\nThe post Triangle Strategy update adds an extra story chapter appeared first on Destructoid.",

Brett Medlock and company are looking at Star Wars action games: which have a long and storied history dating back to early consoles and the PC platform.\nHaving experienced Star Wars games basically since they started taking hold on the NES, I've seen an unprecedented amount of massive hits mixed with poor decision-making across the board. Star Wars is so massive that Lucas and Disney respectively could not and cannot currently contain it, and licensing projects out to other studios is just a cold reality. But as we moved out of the relatively safe zone of '90s console platformers and PC flight sims, things got a little dicier. If you're curious, yes, the flood of prequel games is covered in the video (that all starts roughly 3:00 in!).\nThankfully, there are tons of bright spots like Dark Forces (which evolved into Jedi Knight, augmenting itself to the very spine of the IP itself) and KOTOR to help carry on the \"Star Wars video game\" name as it were. A lot of that light and legacy also shone through for some of the modern hits, like Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. There is still plenty of room for fun and innovative Star Wars titles, so long as creatives are willing to take risks.\nBut don't just take it from me, watch the video below!\nA visual history of Star Wars action games\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fjdkNo2oBs\nThe post Star Wars action games have a fascinating history: watch it unfold in our new video series! appeared first on Destructoid.",

And we're absolutely getting off on the right foot, with these skins that turn poster boys Luke and Jamie in Darkstalkers' very own night slashers, Morrigan and Felicia.\nAs created by artist and modder Remy2FANG, the new skins bring the spirit of Darkstalkers to the Street Fighter 6 universe, just as we all wanted. Luke ditches his horrendous cuffed pants for the succubus' sultry ensemble, while Jamie shows off more than his usual amount of cheek as melee moggy Felicia.\nThey both look cute af, is what I'm saying.\nhttps://twitter.com/Remy2FANG/status/1668445962791174144?s=20\nThe Street Fighter 6 skins are available over at the Nexus Mods hub, and represent just a sliver of the alt costumes that the talented mod community will no doubt be sending into battle over the coming years. Of course, it goes without saying that modding titles is a strictly unofficial deal, and players will want to make sure that they know exactly what they're doing before they go poking around in the game's source folders.\nEvery Street Fighter title since SFIV has found itself awash in awesome creations, often referencing characters and worlds from the gaming universe.

Not much more has been shown about it, other than that it brings the three entries together into one bundle. I imagine it will be packaged the same as the original trilogy collection was.\nAnd justice for all\nThis compilation is a very intriguing collection of games. While the original trilogy followed the first three games, showing lawyer Phoenix Wright's early career and journey, this second trilogy switches gears and looks towards Apollo Justice.\nApollo is a personal favorite of mine, and I'm really happy to see his trilogy get a collection. These games were part of the 3DS catalogue, so seeing them escape the shutdown is nice. As far as the actual games, I feel like reception on them is a bit more mixed compared to the original Ace Attorney trilogy. That said, I personally enjoy these entries quite a bit. Spirit of Justice actually contains one of my favorite cases in the entire Ace Attorney series!\nHopefully, having three collections at this point—the original, the Apollo games, and the Great Ace Attorney duology—means a new entry is a possibility.

          "description": "But don't mark your calendars just yet\nNo doubt, plenty of you horror fans have been anticipating Bloober Team's upcoming remake of Silent Hill 2. Some of you will be excited, while some of you may be holding back judgment. In any case, it's on a lot of people's lips, and the game may have its release date already.\nAs spotted by Twitter user ResiEvilCentral, Australian website Gaming Gorilla has made Silent Hill 2 available for pre-order, at a cost of $89 AUS (about $60 US). However, the most interesting part about this listing is that it says the \"expected release date\" for the remake down as September 29, 2023.\nNow, given that neither Konami nor the developer has said when it's likely to launch, where Gaming Gorilla got this information is definitely interesting. Last we heard, Bloober Team denied SH2 was ready for release. The fact that both Steam and the PlayStation Store also do not list a release date means this could well have been in error.\nhttps://twitter.com/resievilcentral/status/1668311447212785692\nEither that or someone somewhere has access to information the rest of aren't privy to. As of this moment, there is no official release date for the game, so it's entirely likely that this is just a rumor or someone has made a mistake. At the time of writing, the \"leaked\" release date is still on the retailer's website. However, it's best not to get your hopes up until the studio/publisher either confirm or deny these latest developments.\nSilent Hill enjoys a pretty solid legacy, though it's been lying dormant for too long. The second installment, released in 2001, has gone down as one of the most important survival horror games of all time. Given this, it's not surprising that so many are looking forward to the remake. Whether Bloober Team can pull it off remains to be seen at this stage.\nThe post Retailer may have leaked Silent Hill 2 launch date appeared first on Destructoid.",

He even provided Wright’s voice in the original game. Perhaps the game he is proudest, of, however, is the 2011 (2010 in Japan) DS game, Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective.\nFollowing its DS release, the game was ported to iOS devices, but later this month, it will land on consoles for the first time. Ghost Trick will be available on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on June 30 where it will receive a visual upgrade and the first opportunity to play it without a touch-screen. Ahead of the release we spoke over e-mail with Takumi, producer Shingo Izumi, and the director of the port, Atsushi Maruyama, about Ghost Trick’…",

Next week, PlayStation fans finally get their turn.\nDeveloper Cellar Door Games has announced that Rogue Legacy 2 will make the jump to PS5 and PS4 on June 20. Like the first game, you’ll take a randomly generated knight boasting a mix of strengths and sometimes hilariously crippling weaknesses through a sprawling castle to kill monsters, collect treasure, and uncover new areas. Between runs, you’ll spend hard-earned loot upgrading your town HQ, and unlocking new stores while improving the traits of your lineage of warriors to raise your odds of surviving subsequent runs. \n\n\nWe awarded Rogue Legacy 2 a 9 out of 10 in our review, with former editor John Carson writing, \"Despite my nitpicks, every new discovery unveiled, skills obtained, and boss defeated wipes away any grief and replaces it with deep satisfaction. There’s a lot to clean up with the core progression systems to make the ramp from beginning to end escalate more evenly, but I’ve enjoyed most of my hours struggling through countless generations of my goofy little bloodline. I am overjoyed the entertaining heritage of this series remains firmly intact.\"",

Like the game, the plot unfolds on a cursed island consumed by a devastating plague that has warped its residents into dangerous monsters. Only a flame-headed hero of legend can set things right, even though said savior isn’t entirely thrilled with the idea. \n\n\nDead Cells consists of 10 seven-minute-long episodes that will first air exclusively on the French anime streaming service ADN (which is co-producing the show) before becoming available worldwide. \nFor more on Dead Cells, check out our impressions of its last major crossover expansion, Return to Castlevania. If you're looking for other animated series based on your favorite games, Vampire Survivors and Scott Pilgrim vs. The World are just a couple of titles with adaptations in the works.",

          "description": "Over the past few years, Capcom has steadily been sending their beloved Ace Attorney series to modern consoles. Today, it announced it is completing the collection with Apollo Justice Ace Attorney Trilogy, out in early 2024.\nThe collection includes Apollo Justice Ace Attorney, originally released on the DS, as well as the series' two 3DS games, Dual Destinies and Spirit of Justice. While the games can be played in isolation, they're collectively understood to be entries four, five, and six in the Ace Attorney series, following the events of the original Phoenix Wright trilogy on the DS. The collection will include remastered HD visuals of each of the games while preserving their original styles. This means Apollo Justice Ace Attorney will still be 2D, but the latter two will feature updated 3D sprites.\n\n\nThe Ace Attorney series follows defense lawyers Phoenix Wright and Apollo Justice as they're tasked to defend people accused of murder. The Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney Trilogy was brought to modern consoles in 2019, and The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles (a prequel series set during the industrial revolution) came to modern consoles in 2021. Today's newest collection means all of the series' mainline games will be available to play on modern consoles.\nApollo Justice Ace Attorney Trilogy will be available early next year on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC.",

There's also a look at some of Basim's special powers.\nCheck out the gameplay footage below.\n\n\nNotably, the Assassin's Creed series shifting away from this style of game was, in fact, due to franchise fatigue. 2017's Assassin's Creed Origins took the series towards an RPG slant, furthered by Assassin's Creed Odyssey and Valhalla. But all old things are new again, and fatigue gives way to nostalgia.

          "description": "After a series of closed beta periods, XDefiant is ready for public testing. Announced during today's Ubisoft Forward, the series-spanning mashup shooter will enter into a brief open beta period later this month, from June 21-23. The event will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. \nXDefiant will properly release this summer. The game is free-to-play, and while there's no release date yet, Ubisoft did give us a glimpse into what content will be available in the game's early days. Firstly, everything from the beta periods will be available at launch. This includes 14 maps, 5 modes, and 24 weapons. The game's five factions (Deadsec, Libertad, Phantoms, Echelon, and Cleaners) will be available, as well, though you'll have to unlock Deadsec through gameplay. We also got a quick look at some of the content coming in the game's first year. There will be 12 new weapons and 12 new maps, which is a pretty significant expansion on the game's existing content, but also four entirely new factions. The only clue to each new faction is a series of silhouettes and an XDefiant logo with a different design.\nFor more on XDefiant, check out our preview, or if you want to see some gameplay, our episode of New Gameplay Today.",

The RDA has expanded to the western frontier led by John Mercer, who abducts you and other Na’vi to groom you into weapons to use against your own people. After being placed into cryosleep, you awaken 15 years later to a new world and must catch up on what’s happened to stop the RDA. That involves reconnecting with other tribes and learning what it means to be Na’vi again to regain their trust.\n\n\nThe game is a first-person adventure where you’ll wield native weapons like bows and human firearms while also riding atop native beasts. The open-world game features several settlements and clans that you'll travel to using bonded mounts, both ground-based and flying, which you can name, feed, and customize. Frontiers of Pandora also supports 2-player online co-op. \nWe also got a long-awaited release date: December 7. Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

To set things right, you’ll travel back to key moments in the past where your actions have a Butterfly Effect on Avalon’s future. Hopping between the past and an ever-changing present shows off the game's complex choice-driven storytelling and reactive role-playing, as you'll meet various versions of characters depending on how you tinker with time. \n\n\nThe game is described as featuring a “deep, narrative-driven world” while the action unfolds in the form of first-person gunplay using steam-powered firearms as well as time-bending technology, such as reversing the time-flow of objects. \nClockwork Revolution is being developed by inXile Entertainment, makers of the Wasteland and A Bard’s Tale series, and is coming “in due time” to Xbox Series X/S and PC.

The game is set in the universe established by the Pillars of Eternity, a world called Eora. However, unlike those prior games, this game is likely to draw more direct comparisons to titles like the Elder Scrolls games, or the gameplay perspective of Obsidian’s other successful franchise, The Outer Worlds.\nThe new trailer shows an impressive series of first-person encounters in which we see the lead character wielding both medieval weaponry (and firearms!) along with a potent selection of spells to capture and destroy foes. The accompanying voiceover suggests that the story involves the lead character traveling to an area of Eora called the Living Lands – a part of the world established in the Pillars game as a diverse island to the north characterized by strange weather patterns and strange creatures. The player character arrives as an envoy of the emperor of Aedyr, to look into rumors of an unnatural plague.\nAvowed is coming to Xbox and PC in 2024. Check out the full trailer below.",

This open-world adventure gives players the power to remove textures from the environment itself to slap on other objects, opening the door for some inventive puzzle-solving.\nAs Ruffy, you’re the chosen one with the power of Swap. That means you can mix and match elements of the world as you see fit. Need to climb up a mountain? Rip that patch of vines off a wall and slap it over a waterfall to create an instant climbing path. Change the time of day by switching out the sun and moon. Turn a heavy stone into a floating platform by replacing it with a wood texture. Copy and paste are your best friends and seemingly allow for a number of creative solutions to Riverside's many challenges. \n\n\nIn addition to a primary story campaign, you’ll tackle sidequests given by the colorful residents. Speaking of color, the world sports a great-looking papercraft art direction. Thankfully, we shouldn’t have to wait terribly long to explore Ruffy and the Riverside since it launches later this year for Switch and PC (with other consoles to be announced later).",

Bell's response included allegations of copyright misuse, abuse of process, champerty and maintenance and unlawful means conspiracy. That hasn't gone according to plan.\nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",

          "description": "A stalwart party exploring the unknown, seeking the fabled Inner Sanctum. But all is not what it seems in the world of Varn...\nThe ScummVM Team is pleased to announce full support for the PC version of the first game of the Might and Magic series: Might and Magic Book One: The Secret of the Inner Sanctum. Two modes are supported:\nThe original look and feel of the game (sound, which in the original consisted of merely the occasional beep, is not supported)\nA ScummVM-exclusive enhanced mode, which uses the interface of the later Xeen games, including niceties such as better character screens, automapping, and sound effects. It also integrates the impressive \"Might and Magic 1 Graphics Overhaul Mod\", which provides better in-game map and monster graphics. The xeen.cc file is required from Might and Magic: IV or Might and Magic: World of Xeen.\nBoth modes allow saving your game anywhere outside of combat via the ScummVM Global Main Menu (unlike the original game that only saved a single roster when checking into an inn). So make sure you save regularly, just in case you encounter problems.\nHelp us test both game modes by grabbing a daily build and adding mm.dat to the same folder as your game files. Read through our testing guidelines, and please take some screenshots along the way.\nNow, go forth, and discover the true secrets of the game that started the long running epic fantasy series!\n>",

          "description": "As I write this many of the development team and other members of the community are busy having fun at a meet-up in Brussels. Not me though, I’m stuck here doing a release. We’ve been busy refactoring quite a lot of the underlying code to make future changes easier, but along the way we’ve found and fixed a few more bugs and quality of life improvements that we figured were worth releasing sooner than whenever 14.0 comes along. Notably, OpenTTD will now automatically disable hardware acceleration if it detects that the last crash happened while initialising the graphics driver. While hardware acceleration works well for the vast majority of people, it causes crashes for people that then required command line arguments or manual config file editing to get it to work. This should be a better solution for those users. Additionally, there is a change to the default mouse mode on Linux to improve experience when dragging the map (and often to match expected behaviour in other games). As always, there are plenty of other bugfixes, which you can find in the changelog. While you’re at it, have you seen the post about the upcoming addition of a automated opt-in survey to OpenTTD 14? If you have opinions, we’d like to hear them! Details here. PS: we made a mistake in the Windows release; a 13.2.1 was pushed to address this issue. It is fully network compatible with 13.2, so no need to update unless you want to. Download Changelog Bug tracker",
