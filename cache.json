Well, a couple of years down the line, developer Neognosis has announced that the Switch port is now cancelled as a result of last week's controversial policy changes from Unity (thanks, VGC).\nAs a brief recap, Unity last week announced plans for a 'Runtime Fee' policy, which would effectively charge development studios each time a game made using the Unity engine was installed. This was met with instant backlash, of which BallisticNG's Switch port cancellation is but one example, and the plans were later changed in the aftermath.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

If you don’t know — and there’s a good chance you don’t — Bud Spencer and Terence Hill were a movie duo popularised in the '60s and '70s for their slapstick adventures and at-odds physical profiles. Born in Italy as Mario Girotti and Carlo Pedersoli, they started out in gag-laden spaghetti westerns before changing their names for the Western market, dubbed over successfully enough to build up a large fan following.\nThey’re an odd fit for a modern video game, not least because a large proportion of the market will have no knowledge of their work. At the same time, Trinity Team’s beat 'em up is imbued with such a fantastic sense of spirit, fun, and adventure, that even the uninitiated will find it endearing.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Spoiler: it's bad.\nSo, let's take a look at this technical rundown, shall we? In order to save on download size and get the massive game running on Nintendo's comparatively smaller hardware, the Switch version drops the bit-rate and resolution of story mode cutscenes as well as the fights themselves.

Between dust-ups, you can play basketball and leave crayon graffiti for other players care of a Dark Souls-style messaging system. It's a feast!\r\n\n\r\nThe game was due to launch into Steam early access tomorrow, 27th September, but unfortunately, there's been a delay.

Said commenters might be tickled to know that there is, in fact, a puddle in the game's Akila City that contains infinite loot: by dint of peering into it, you'll magically gain access to a nearby store's inventory. Strip the shelves, then wait a day or two, and you'll be able to do so again, forever and ever. Or at least, that was the case till this week's Starfield patch, a small update consisting of exactly ten bulletpoints, including one that tackles \"an issue that allowed for a vendor's full inventory to be accessible\". Boo! Time to go looking for another convenient in-game metaphor, I guess.

          "description": "About a third of the way through Mineko's Night Market, a young boy dressed as a fish says to his octopus-chopping father, \"What? I just thought sending the local errand kid on missions was how people acquired stuff on this island.\" To many, this will simply be a comic jibe at what you, the aforementioned local errand kid, have been doing for the last eight hours or so. After moving to this rural backwater with your dad in search of a better life, you quickly realise that no one in this town ever gets off their arse to get anything done.\nInstead, it's up to you, Mineko, to fulfil every last one of their desires, whether it's collecting 50 bits of wood so they can construct a frame for their new house (before asking you for 50 bits of paper to give it some flimsy-looking walls), buying and delivering them a sports drink they could have easily got themselves from the local shop, or crafting a flower box for them because, well, they asked you to. As I said, industry isn't exactly their strong suit here, and you'd be forgiven for wondering how any of them functioned as human beings before you arrived.\nBut this line of dialogue also strikes right at the heart of what a joyless experience Mineko's Night Market is. It reveals the cold, lifeless husk beneath its lovely visuals. It's nothing but 'Me, me, me' and 'Take, take, take' in this game, and NPCs offer nothing in return except soul-crushing tedium and a long list of repetitive chores. Animal Crossing this is not, my friends, so don't be fooled. This is about as far from 'cosy' and 'cute' as you can possibly get - and that's despite it having dozens of pet-able cats.\nRead more",

          "description": "Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty is, according to our reviewer Graham, \"perhaps the best expansion pack ever made.\" Feh, small potatoes – Phantom Liberty’s most prestigious achievement is surely how it heralds a new ray tracing feature that makes Cyberpunk 2077 look and run a tiny bit better. On specific settings. And only on GeForce RTX graphics cards. The more expensive ones.\nHello, then, to DLSS 3.5 and its Ray Reconstruction component. Like how DLSS improves visuals and performance with AI-aided upscaling and ant-aliasing, Ray Reconstruction injects some machine learning cleverness into the rendering of ray tracing. Nvidia say Ray Reconstruction cleans up artefacts and reduces the performance impact of RT effects, and judging by how it works in Cyberpunk 2077, I’d say they’re correct – with the caveat that all its enhancements are, ultimately, modest.\nRead more",

          "description": "Dragon's Dogma was the action-RPG for people who wanted to play alone, but didn't want to feel alone. By far its most charming feature was the Pawn system, whereby you'd create an AI-controlled sidekick and hire two others, shared online by other players, to accompany you on your journey through a fantasy wilderness of tumbledown castles and goblin campfires. Pawns make dependable companions in many respects - pinning enemies for you to tag-team kill, healing or resurrecting you, opening chests you've missed, and enchanting your weapons at the outset of each skirmish. But what makes them fun to be around is that they're a bunch of massive buffoons. \r\n\n\r\nPawns talk without cease as you explore: a steady patter of idle observations about well-wrought staircases and the local fish trade, advice about the bestiary and, in the case of Pawns recruited from other players, quest tips based on time in their own worlds - all of it couched in the game's quirky faux-medieval dialect. Pawn dialogue is highly context-sensitive, and very often, nonsensical. They'll climb into fountains and complain that they're wet, and launch into pithy descriptions of monsters even as they're set on fire. It ought to be maddening, but somehow, it never is - probably because the Pawns never actually attempt to be witty like ally characters in, say, Xenoblade Chronicles. They're resolutely straight foils in a realm of lions with snakes for tails, chaotic boulder traps, unpleasantly lusty ogres, and players who push the wrong buttons and make random decisions on the fly. Well, pawns are back in Dragon's Dogma 2, which I recently played an hour of, and they're chattier than ever.\r\n\n \nRead more",

She’s also been beaten, rather soundly, by a man using only his mouth.\r\n\nOr, to be more precise, a QuadStick FPS, a specialised game controller comprised of a mouth-operated joystick and several 'sip and puff' switches. It’s the favoured tool of professional streamer and Guinness World Record holder Rocky \"RockyNoHands\" Stoutenburgh, who in 2022 used it to become the first quadriplegic Elden Ring player to claim Malenia’s scalp. This was a win for a QuadStick as well: a showcase of how adaptive hardware and clever controller design could make games more accessible than ever, enabling players with disabilities to match and exceed the heroics of their able-bodied peers. And yet, there’s little sense – among disabled players, advocacy groups, or even controller manufacturers – that accessible hardware is entering its golden age. While major breakthroughs have been made, high prices and commercial concerns still carry the threat of willing, eager players being left behind.\nRead more",

          "description": "It's been a clear decade since the last entry in this co-op crimeathon FPS series, so I was interested to play Payday 3. Payday is exactly the sort of online multiplayer I can get behind: PvE with clear but theoretically malleable goals (theft!). But although compared to Crime Boss: Rockay City it's a crushing 60st monster truck tyre, Payday 3 isn't really reinventing the Payday 2 wheel. In some respects you might think it's rolling backwards, and while dedicated Payday 2 players may well switch over to the current gen iteration, you get the sense they'll be complaining about things the whole time.\nRead more",

Wētā Workshop and Private Division have announced Tales of the Shire, a \"heart-warming\" experience that will release on PC in 2024. I've got a live action trailer for you, in which a young person doodles pictures of Hobbits, while seated at a desk intriguingly strewn with modern appliances such as laptops and assorted Lord of the Rings paraphernalia. The book she's doodling in contains sketches of celebrated locations such as the Green Dragon pub in Bywater, and there are drawings of dolls, Hobbit-holes and onions.

It is a game happy to leave you lost, confused, misunderstanding, weirded-out, frustrated, and stuck.\"\nYet, Morrowind is loved!

With development being led by former Irrational Games co-founder Robert Fermier and Age Of Empires II lead designer Ian M Fischer, Millennia will see you attempting that classic quad of Xs across ten distinct historical ages, starting in the Stone Age before eventually ending up in a \"post-modern future\", designer Ben Friedman tells me. \nThe twist here, however, is that you've also got what C-Prompt are calling 'Variant Ages', which let you bend the timeline to your will. Some of these variants are more historical in nature, such as an Age Of Monuments where everyone's building Egyptian pyramids, Friedman explains, while others are more fantastical, with the words steampunk, alchemy and space alien invasions all mentioned in the same sentence. I had a good time with it during my demo, but the real delight was seeing my home army of Kyoto go and invade neighbouring settlement Telford, before going on to conquer Rome - as you do.

It's called Spectra, and it's set in the US in an alt-history 1972 where Soviet Union is the dominant military power after President Roosevelt was deposed in a fascist coup. You play as a Soviet agent tasked with infiltrating and fomenting revolution in a fortress city called Hiwatha.\nTucci wants Spectra to meet the criteria players will expect from an immersive sim. \"To me, the immersive sim is the platonic ideal of the video game\" she says. \"I've tried to deliver on that immersion by creating an environment that is extremely interactable and flexible in the ways it can be used.\" She explains that \"a quite frankly silly proportion of the buildings in each map are enterable and that \"you can turn off the lights, set traps, and use things like televisions, radios, or payphones as lures.\"\r\n\n\r\nIt sounds like everything immersive sim fans want. But there's one big difference between Spectra and the games that inspired it. Tucci is making it on her own. And she isn't the only indie developer working in one of the most ambitious, developmentally complex genres in the industry. Games like Shadows Of Doubt, Fallen Aces and Gloomwood are merely the steam rising from the bubbling magma chamber that is indie immersive sim development, Like the recent revival of retro shooters, the indie space is on the verge of an immersive sim eruption.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Run along and watch your silly non-interactive movies and TV shows - but it's quite novel for a fantasy RPG in the BioWare tradition.

The route to this in Stardew Valley is actually quite hard, requiring mastery of several different interlocked systems that each ask a level of expertise that, on most days, I cannot be arsed to work towards. I love Stardew Valley, to be clear, but I hold no expectation of ever getting the most out of the farm space alloted to you as a result of your grandfather's death.\nFae Farm is a Stardewlike with a fantastical veneer and 3D graphics, but importantly it frontloads progress. It's slightly easier, in ways that seem small but cumulatively mean it takes up way less of your brain's runtime on bad days. For example: all activities, including watering your crops, use less energy than in Stardew Valley. This means you can run around clearing farm space and gathering resources, and have a working plot in just a couple of days. Heck, you can have a pretty full day in the mines before you've mechanised your farm. Game changer!\nRead more",

          "description": "Among the chunkier morsels from yesterday's leak of Microsoft documents is an extended email from Xbox CEO Phil Spencer, dating from 2020, in which he argues that today's largest AAA videogame publishers remain dogged by their \"failure\" to adapt to the shift from physical to digital videogame distribution, and especially, subscription models such as Microsoft's own Game Pass. This inability to move with the times, Spencer suggests, has created a situation whereby the largest publishers rely on sheer \"production scale\" to attract and retain customers. \r\n\n\r\nIn turn, this has meant that publishers are unwilling to bet on new IPs - it could be billions down the drain, after all. Instead, \"AAA publishers are milking their top franchises but struggling to refill their portfolio of hit franchises\", while relying on \"rented\" IPs such as Star Wars. This is an older email, of course, and there's an obvious element of self-flattery in the shape of Microsoft talking up Game Pass. Still, it's a persuasive account of recent industry history, bolstered by Spencer's notes from conversations with Assassin's Creed outfit Ubisoft and GTA publisher Take-Two Interactive in particular.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Scumhead's Franzen - released a few days ago on Steam and Itch - has a couple of big draws, straight off the bat. Firstly and least importantly, it's free, which it really shouldn't be. Secondly and more significantly, it's one of those rare RPG miniatures that is both richly imagined and snappy, with a busy and befuddling world in which you have immediate clear motivations that escalate rapidly and breed Dire Implications. It also looks like a 16-bit Pathologic, so consider me firmly on board.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "At first glance, Lies Of P looks like a wannabe Bloodborne reskin, replacing the Gothic edges of Yarnham with a twisted version of a kid's fairytale. There are silhouettes in windows sheltering from an infection that's plagued the populace and puppets who've gone awol. Take damage and you've got a chance to recoup the costs by smacking the baddie back. There's a bit where you platform down a large well, thin planks of wood marking your descent. Survive and you might want to visit your doll-like maiden and spend your souls.\nBut is Lies Of P just another boring pretender to Bloodborne? No! I think it's worked with its Gothic Pinocchio theme remarkably well, and the option to snap and configure your puppet lad to your liking makes its journey feel distinct. Sure, Lies Of P might lack some of the presence of its main inspiration, and not all of its parts come together to form a cohesive whole, but the game is an undeniable must for Soulslikers who crave the dark. It's perhaps the closest any Soulslike has felt to a FromSoft game, in everything from its presentation to the cadence of your character's jog.\nRead more",

          "description": "I dunno if you've heard of this game Starfield, but there's a lot of talk about it at the moment. It is a roleplaying experience where the role you play is not \"Viking-ish warrior who can shout with the power of a million metal frontmen\" or \"wasteland wanderer downing cans of irradiated coke\" but \"person in space following a broadly unexciting A-plot\". Much of the most interesting stuff in Starfield is on the periphery of the main story, as is the case with most Bethesda RPGs, but I find Starfield to be much less whimsical (something I won't relitigate here). As an RPG, Starfield is taking itself seriously, and sometimes this collides with the design game systems and menus.\nAn example of this is that you are supposed to experience the vastness of space, but cannot do so without going through a lot of loading screens. Another is that you have two sets of clothes: a spacesuit for places that are hostile and have no breathable atmosphere, and street clothes for planets that do. And NPCs keep making fun of me for wearing my spacesuit when I don't need to, and I hate them for it.\nRead more",

          "description": "Overnight, in what Edwin called an \"unredacted document oopsie\" related to Microsoft trying to buy ActiBlizz, two things have been revealed that interest me. Well, three. Firstly, Phil Spencer capitalises \"Gaming\", which I hate. Secondly, as noted in that linked story, Phil Spencer wants to buy Nintendo and, in pitying also-ran brackets, Valve, which has some of the same energy as me walking into an estate agent and demanding a six bedroom house with a new fitted kitchen and a hidden library. And thirdly, according to a release schedule from a presentation dated 2020, Bethesda and Zenimax have planned out their next few years of games in depressing MCU presentation-style. Boy, are the next couple of years going to be whelming.\nAs is predictable now, it is largely a list of sequels and remasters, many of them dated quite optimistically, it must be said. This document pegs Starfield for 2021, for example, and obviously that didn't happen. There are also two unnamed games on there for this year (Projects Kestrel and Platinum; 2021's Project Hibiki we know refers to the surprise-released Hi-Fi Rush) and it seems unlikely they're going to appear before the end of the year. We know The Elder Scrolls 6 isn't coming for at least another five years. They're going to remaster Oblivion (but not Morrowind, the weird cousin everyone else likes most, but whose parents aren't sure what job to give them in 2023). And they're going to make Dishonored 3. I'm excited about that! But also fearful.\nRead more",

We've learned that Microsoft are still rather keen on buying Nintendo (and Valve), and that the company had planned out the release of Dishonored 3, an Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion remaster and a Ghostwire: Tokyo sequel during the run-up to its acquisition of ZeniMax. \r\n\n\r\nThe leaked documents also include extensive internal pitch and presentation materials regarding Microsoft's first-party gaming operations all the way to 2030.

No other game sounds like Hypnospace. Featuring a veritable mountain of tracks (most of which was composed by the game's creator, Jay Tholen), Hypnospace’s extensive catalogue stretches across genres both real and imaginary. While Seepage’s Nothing Left For Me is a clear pastiche of Linkin Park, Fre3zer’s Icy Girl is a purposefully poor attempt to mimic Coolpunk, a genre built upon remixes of a jingle for a discontinued soda brand. The most exciting thing about Hypnospace is that its soundtrack is so dense and complex that there's opportunity to hyperfocus on one particular area to an intense - even problematic - degree.\nEnter The Chowder Man, a stetson wearing Kid Rock analogue who makes frequent appearances throughout Hypnospace. A prominent rock musician in the 80s, Erik Helman (portrayed beautifully by musician, comedian and inventor of the Rick Roll Hot Dad) is attempting a last-ditch revival after his music career flatlined, transforming him from Jagger-esque superstar to sold-out jingle writer. The Chowder Man’s in-game discography is strange and varied, spanning from glorious rock ballads to 22 second earworms about a microwavable butter-based dessert. Totalling ten tracks, I have decided that it is my duty - nay, my fate - to rank and review them in their entirety. So let us commence this spiritual journey together, my friends, into the complex mind of The Chowder Man. \nRead more",

Mortal Kombat 1 might be using its conspicuous numeric digit to suggest a reset or rethink of some kind, but in truth it isn't remotely concerned with reinventing its world of misfits. While part of me wishes this surface-level overhaul had been more radical, it's maybe unwise to expect that. For decades this series has embraced its love of brainless ultraviolence and childish storytelling. If Mortal Kombat 1 can be praised for anything, it is unwavering kommitment to the bit.\nRead more",

          "description": "Often when we talk about \"hype\" surrounding a release, it’s in anticipation of shared cultural euphoria more than that of a great gaming experience. Either way, a great RPG game hits different. Recently, Elden Ring and Baldur's Gate 3 have both been landmarks. Not to mention the enduring sweep of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and the Minesweeper-esque ubiquity of Skyrim. When studios get the RPG right, the end result inspires excitement and devotion in ways that feel utterly unique to the genre.\nTo this end I chatted to Dragon Age, Baldur’s Gate, and Mass Effect maestro Mark Darrah, some of the folks at Studio ZA/UM, and the minds behind the two definitive tomes on CRPG history: Matt Barton of Dungeons And Desktops, and Felipe Pepe of The CRPG Book. I wanted to ask these genere experts about all things choice and consequence, player freedom, and Baldur’s Gate 3’s phenomenal success. What turns a niche into a phenomenon? What goes into creating a great RPG? And what makes the genre so special to people? Turns out that last one is a big question to ask.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's part of the surprisingly prosperous genre of \"team up to complete some big unwieldy task with multiple moving parts\" games, and while it hasn't yet hit the highs of Overcooked or reached the terrible depths of Barotrauma, I think the recently launched Early Access build might be worth your time. Amongst other things, it's trying for a curious blend of jolly party game and macabre theocracy work simulator. And it does have some rather swanky-looking ships.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Over the weekend, Starfield players began to share reports of a strange paranormal infestation. There are asteroids in the game that, for reasons known only to gods and/or programmers, follow you from orbit to orbit, flying eerily in formation with your ship, and sometimes even accompanying you to a planet's surface. \"In one of my weirdest Bethesda glitch experiences, I've got a tiny asteroid that's been following me for the past 30 hours,\" user ReverendRoo posted on Reddit, triggering an avalanche of comments reminiscent of UFO chasers spotting each other at a NASA open day. \"I would catch a glimpse of it from time to time,\" wrote fattfett. \"I tried to approach it but you can't. It stays away. I assumed it had a deeper meaning [toward] the endgame.\" Some players, like Blackdius, have multiple asteroids in tow. It seems impossible to blow them up. I've dug up a Youtube video below of one such clingy space boulder from a couple of weeks back. As you can see, it's not just a fixed background point like a screen artefact, but seems to move in response to the player's ship. Most peculiar.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Sony is no stranger to having its private data leaked, sometimes to the detriment of its customers. The company may be in trouble again, as a group called Ransomed.vc claims to have compromised all of Sony's systems. \n\n\nThe group also claims that Sony has refused to pay, and it is therefore attempting to sell the data it has retrieved. Despite the shady activities, Ransomed.vc is attempting to appear as a legitimate business that offers penetration testing and is compliant with GDPR and data privacy laws.\n\n\nCyber Security Connect first reported the story, and it claims that the group has been \"operating since September, despite some links to previous forums and groups.\" No price is given for the data, but there is a \"post date\" of September 28, which could be when the data is leaked. \n\n\nAccording to Cyber Security Connect, some evidence is given but it is not particularly compelling. It features \"screenshots of an internal log-in page, an internal PowerPoint presentation outlining test bench details, and a number of Java files.\" Sony has yet to comment on any hacks or data compromises. \n\n\nIf Sony has been compromised, it won't be the only gaming company to suddenly find its private matters in the public. Recently, through what seems like a bit of clumsiness on Microsoft's part, plenty of Xbox's plans were leaked. \n\nThe post Ransomware group claims to have hacked Sony appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The 3DS housed no shortage of RPGs, ranging from beloved classics to esoteric oddities. While titles in that second category can be easily forgotten, sometimes games just need a second chance in a new market. Case in point, NISA has announced an HD remaster of The Legend of Legacy will hit modern consoles in early 2024.\n\n\n\n\nThe Legacy of The Legend of Legacy\n\n\nFor those who originally missed this one, The Legend of Legacy is an interesting case. Developed by FuRyu, The Legend of Legacy featured several names that worked on Square Enix’s Final Fantasy and SaGa series, including Kyoji Koizumi and Masato Kato. And just like the SaGa series, the game proved to be an acquired taste. Destructoid alumni Kyle MacGregor Burleson scored this a mere 4.5 back in 2015, citing the game’s repetitive combat and rigid progression systems. The similar art style to the acclaimed Bravely Default likely drew unintended comparisons as well.\n\n\nHowever, also like the SaGa series, The Legend of Legacy did attract its share of fans. And for those who like what this RPG is selling, this rerelease should hopefully be a pleasant surprise. As of writing, no gameplay changes have been confirmed for this HD version of the game. However, it certainly looks prettier than its original 3DS incarnation, I’ll give it that.\n\n\nScreenshot via NIS America\n\n\nI never played this one back in the day, and I have no clue if I’d find time to get around to it next year. Not when I have 500 hours of The Legend of Heroes games to play, at least. But for those who did enjoy this one, I hope the remaster delivers.\n\n\nThe Legend of Legacy HD Remastered will release in early 2024 for the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC.\n\nThe post The Legend of Legacy HD Remastered marks the divisive dungeon crawler’s return in 2024 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The Baldur's Gate 3 cast can be summed up as an eclectic cast of weirdos forcibly brought together by fate. Despite their constant life-or-death situations, they find time to bicker and form deep friendships. The idea describes many RPG casts, but Baldur's Gate 3's cast also fits as sitcom characters.\n\n\nA fan named Sho seemed to think so also and recreated the Friends intro using the cast. It honestly works even if the concept is absurd. \n\n\n\n\nSho captures the main cast's varying quirks within a light-hearted 45-second edit using the Friends theme.  If I looked at this from an outsider's perspective, I could tell that someone like Lae'zel is confident and bratty, while Astarion is sass personified as an elf. \n\n\nWord about this clip spread enough that both Baldur's Gate 3's developers and voice actors saw it and complimented the clip. Another top comment complimented Sho for including Lae'zel rolling her eyes, something I agree was amazing to include. \n\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 works as many things, and it works as a sitcom. Players are always finding odd and hilarious moments that sell it as a comedy even if it tackles some heavy subjects.\n\n\nThis is to say that a sitcom edit for Baldur's Gate 3 fits surprisingly well. Fans grow attached to the various fun and lovable characters, something that both describes the game and the best sitcoms on TV. \n\n\nBoth also follow the said lovable cast as each member grows and solidifies a group bond along with individual relationships. Canned laughter is really all Baldur's Gate 3 needs to sell itself as a sitcom in a fantasy setting.\n\nThe post Baldur’s Gate 3 fan recreates the Friends intro with BG3’s party appeared first on Destructoid.",

Timespinner 2: Unwoven Dream looks to bring more Symphony of the Night inspired exploration to consoles and PC. Specific platforms beyond Steam are still TBD along with a release date. In the meantime, you can get yourself acquainted with the new entry in the announcement trailer. \n\n\n\n\nAccording to the official site, Timespinner 2 is set after the events of the first game. Players should expect to see some familiar faces returning along with new characters in the interconnected realm known as Surflynd. In addition to Symphony of the Night—which the previous entry took inspiration from while carving its own niche—this Metroidvania aims to pay homage to other '90s classics. Jeff Ball is once again composing the soundtrack that serves as the backdrop to some beautiful pixel art.\n\n\nScreenshot via Lunar Ray Games\n\n\nBack into the fray with Timespinner 2\n\n\nTimespinner 2 has players taking control of Auria, a retired war hero. After her son runs away to prove himself as the hero destined to prevent the collapse of reality, Auria heads out to save him.

Kamiya’s resignation is effective October 12.\n\n\n\n\n“We are truly grateful for [Kamiya’s] creative ideas, leadership, and contribution to the growth of PlatinumGames from our start-up to this very day,” said the Bayonetta and Nier: Automata developer in a post on Twitter. It goes on to wish Kamiya success “in his future endeavors as a game creator.”\n\n\n\n\nIn a post made to his personal Twitter account, Kamiya elaborated on his decision to leave Platinum, saying “this came after a lot of consideration based on my own beliefs. and was by no means an easy decision to make,” while also confirming in a reply that he will continue to create “in my Hideki Kamiya way.” This, plus the studio’s well wishes, seem to suggest that Kamiya will continue creating games.\n\n\nKamiya has become notorious on Twitter for his liberal use of the block button, making it very clear that, among other reasons, responding to him in any language other than Japanese would earn an insta-block. \n\n\nKamiya’s career began with Capcom, where he served as a system planner for the original BIOHAZARD, known in the west as Resident Evil. He then went on to become the chief game designer and director for the sequel, BIOHAZARD 2 / Resident Evil 2. Kamiya, Viewtiful Joe producer Atsushi Inaba, and the creator of Resident Evil Shinji Mikami would create Seeds in 2006, the studio that would merge with Tatsuya Minami's Odd Inc. to form PlatinumGames in 2007. It was there where Kamiya would work on titles such as Bayonetta, The Wonderful 101, and Astral Chain.\n\nThe post Hideki Kamiya is leaving PlatinumGames appeared first on Destructoid.",

I guess any opportunity to save money is a good thing, but it's getting hard not to add more games to my ever-growing unplayed Steam library.\n\n\nToday begins the Steam SHMUP Fest, a festival that specifically focuses on the shoot 'em up genre.

          "description": "Theorizing over potential and real acquisition deals remains top of mind in the games industry, thanks in no small part to Microsoft's pending buyout of Activision Blizzard. It's easy to forget that not every large gaming publisher is looking to get acquired in the first place. Capcom, for one, recently noted that its active strategy is to remain independent, even though it's open to more collaborative projects should the opportunity arise. \n\n\nIn a Bloomberg interview with Capcom, COO Haruhiro Tsujimoto explained:  \"I would gracefully decline the [acquisition] offer because I believe it would be better if we were equal partners.\" \n\n\nThough Bloomberg's question posed reference to turning away Microsoft, specifically, it is curious that Tsujimoto didn't necessarily single out the tech giant. Instead, the COO spoke broadly in his commentary. In other words, a Sony acquisition is equally out of the picture from the looks of it.\n\n\n\n\nCapcom isn't for sale, says COO\n\n\nAs one of the most popular and widely acclaimed gaming companies in the industry right now, Capcom enjoys a position of prestige in most respects. With Resident Evil, Monster Hunter, and Street Fighter franchises in tow - just to list a few - Capcom has been riding a high for years now. The company's success doesn't seem likely to wane anytime soon, either, with titles such as Dragon's Dogma 2 already on the horizon.\n\n\nIf there's any major publisher poised to tell Microsoft no, then, Capcom is seemingly the one. Perhaps that's good news for fans of Capcom's output over the last several years. The company was able to not only find its footing but also maintained quality output over numerous releases. Having an umbrella third party meddling in things could dampen that success in some way, shape, or form. And from Tsujimoto's comments, it seems he feels the same way, too. \n\nThe post Capcom would ‘gracefully decline’ Microsoft’s acquisition offers appeared first on Destructoid.",

Well, these days are upon us, and horror fans will be pleased to know that Resident Evil Village is coming to Apple products this Halloween.\n\n\nAccording to Capcom, the eighth installment in the Resident Evil series will release for iPhone and iPad on October 30. This continues the long-standing tradition of releasing horror media during the spookiest time of the year.\n\n\nImage via Capcom.\n\n\nAs for which devices it'll be on, it'll be compatible with iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max. Any iPad Air and iPad Pro that has the M1 chip or later can run Resident Evil Village as well. According to a report from Gematsu (which cites screenshots from Capcom's TGS appearance), the game will be priced at 4,990 yen (around $33), while the \"Winter's Expansion\" will be 2,000 yen (approximately $13).\n\n\nAdditionally, a Mac version of Resident Evil Village is available now.\n\n\nResident Evil 4 coming at some point\n\n\nAs well as that, iPhones and iPads will also feature the remake of Resident Evil 4 at some point. At the time of writing, we only know this version of the Remake will arrive this year. The App store listing says it's expected to release on December 31, though the description clarifies this is a placeholder.\n\n\nBoth RE games are coming to Apple devices as the tech giant moves towards products that have the processing power to handle AAA games.

          "description": "Following a particularly fun and delightful bug from the week prior, Destiny 2 was recently beset by something far less entertaining: a possible DDoS attack from an unknown source. According to player reports on Reddit and other Destiny 2 community hotspots, the game has been suffering from a wide array of connectivity issues both minor and major, up until the point that the whole thing became wholly unplayable for a period of time.\n\n\nThe problems have been so pervasive that players faced issues in all of Destiny 2's game modes, from the Trials of Osiris all the way to the humble Lost Sector missions. PvE enemies have been unresponsive to attacks, while rounds of PvP would wrap up in a tie no matter what, leading to widespread confusion and understandable annoyance with the state of the game.\n\n\n\n\nDid someone DDoS Destiny 2 over the weekend?\n\n\nBroadly speaking, it doesn't seem like the game is in real long-term trouble. While it's certainly a big pain that the players couldn't enjoy Destiny 2 over the past couple of days, the odds are good that Bungie already has a handle on the problems. Most seem to be able to jump into Destiny 2 just fine already, and while that's no guarantee that there won't be further issues down the line, it is a good sign, regardless.\n\n\nThis latest batch of problems, notably, might not have been Bungie's fault after all. While the developer is yet to chime in on anything relating to these issues in an official capacity, some believe that the whole mess is the handiwork of an angry hacker, no less. It goes without saying that this entire story ought to be taken with a pinch of salt, as there's no actual evidence of any sort to corroborate it. At the same time, there is, indeed, a possibility that the theory crafting going on in the featured Reddit thread is correct, which would be a heck of a development all on its own.\n\nThe post Destiny 2 just had one of its roughest weekends yet from a stability perspective appeared first on Destructoid.",

While it's generally regarded as a fantastic game, it still has its faults and room for improvement, and one modder definitely felt it needed better visuals.\n\n\nAs spotted by DSO Gaming, Nexus Mods user Halk Hogan PL recently released their \"HD Reworked Project\" for Starfield. This is essentially a texture pack that gives the Bethesda RPG some graphical oomph. Using side-by-side comparisons, and a video, you can see the difference in visuals this mod makes.\n\n\n\n\nThe creator says that their project \"aims to improve the graphics by reworking game assets to better quality preserving original art style and good performance.\" They also released a similar HD texture pack for The Witcher 3, so this is definitely not their first rodeo.\n\n\nWhen the Todd is away, the mods will play\n\n\nIf there was one thing that was certain in the run-up to Starfield's release, it was that modders would be out in force. Indeed, there was already a slew of custom content from the word \"go.\" We've seen DLSS options be added to the game, an attempt to inject a little Star Wars, and more.\n\n\nBethesda's long-awaited space-faring title stands well on its own, but the community shows that the work is never done. Even being one of the most successful video game studios in the world, Halk Hogan PL felt that Starfield could stand to be better in terms of graphics.\n\nThe post Give Starfield a sharper look with this HD texture pack appeared first on Destructoid.",

Beginning life in 2008, the PC storefront is currently celebrating its 15th year with a mega sale event that sees hundreds of games being discounted.\n\n\nIf you head over to the GOG website, you can peruse all the games that have had their prices slashed for the celebrations. There's pretty much something for everyone here, whether you want 40% off Cyberpunk 2077, 75% off the GOTY edition of Fallout 3, or some other percent signs attached to some other game.\n\n\nScreenshot via Destructoid.\n\n\nThere's also a blog post that gives a little bit of history about the service, as well as a few facts about the website. For example, did you know you can use the famous Konami code on the homepage?\n\n\nIntended to preserve PC gaming\n\n\nStarted by CD Projekt around the time it found fame with the Witcher series, Good Old Games was born as a means of digitally distributing PC games.

          "description": "Stardew Valley remains among the most beloved indie games of the past decade, and its content updates over the years help maintain its popularity. Developer ConcernedApe fuels the farming fanfare with additions both big and small, and it looks like he's teasing another. \n\n\nThe newest of these teases is an image of a parrot on top of a blue perch. It's a cute picture, but the bird's demand for money and capital J on the perch implies there's more to it.\n\n\n\n\nFans noted these features and ascribed them to Jojamart, the supermarket chain that works as Stardew Valley's antagonist. Blue is the company's primary color and is transparently greedy just as this bird seems to be. \n\n\nStardew Valley's farm-hungry community also noted the tropical setting, leading some to speculate that Joja reached Ginger Island. Some assume Jojamart expanded into Ginger Island, so its reach goes beyond Pelican Town. Others speculate that the parrot is an upcoming incentive for players to pursue working with Jojamart.\n\n\nWhatever the answer is, ConcernedApe is keeping mum about the situation. Whether it's for Stardew Valley's 1.6 updates or screenshots from the upcoming Haunted Chocolatier, any context given is often vague.\n\n\nIt's an effective way to stir up Stardew chatter, as fans get a look into an upcoming project only to have more questions than answers. I'm among them, so I eat these teasers up while coming up with my own wild theories. \n\n\nPart of me gets annoyed these teasers have no elaboration, but it also adds to the fun of wondering. Whatever the answer is, a parrot demanding money from players fits right in with all of Stardew Valley's oddities. As for when we'll see the bird, no one knows for now. Stardew Valley version 1.6 doesn't have a release date yet. \n\nThe post Stardew Valley tweet teases money-hungry parrot appeared first on Destructoid.",

Project Blue casts you as Blue, a child trying to escape a research laboratory in Neo Hong Kong. The trailer advertises Perfect Blue as being built from 256 screens, which kind of makes it look like the underappreciated Legacy of the Wizard. In fact, a lot of the game looks like a futuristic Legacy of the Wizard, which I am totally down for. The publisher also says that there will be three difficulty levels that will modify the game’s layout, which is pretty spiffy.\n\n\n\n\nIt’s worth noting that you can already grab Project Blue on PC over on Itch. 8-Bit Legit is the publishing arm of Retrotainment Games and Mega Cat Studios, and is just handling publishing on consoles. I know Retrotainment from Garbage Pail Kids, which was a pretty terrific NES release.\n\n\nI’m always on board for a new NES game. We’ve come a long way from the early days of homebrew titles. Now, we’ve got boutique publishers who handle all the curation and quality control. It’s nice to have the option to play it on modern consoles, but given the option, give me that plastic rectangle and let me slot it into my computer-toaster.\n\n\nProject Blue is currently available on PC. The console version will be available for pre-order starting on September 29, 2023, and the retail release will follow on October 6, 2023.\n\nThe post Project Blue is a cyberpunk sidescroller coming to Switch, Xbox, and… NES appeared first on Destructoid.",

But hidden away in 2077 is a reference just for Cyberpunk: Edgerunners fans, and an especially emotional one at that.\n\n\nIt's no surprise that, after the massive popularity of the Studio Trigger and Netflix anime, CD Projekt would find a way to work the world of Edgerunners more into its digital Night City in Cyberpunk 2077. Heck, we've already seen a few additions, ranging from a special gun to David's signature jacket. With the 2.0 update, though, CD Projekt Red put in a tribute to not just one or two, but several different characters who all made Cyberpunk: Edgerunners what it is.\n\n\n(Spoilers will follow for Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, so go watch it if you haven't yet.

          "description": "HoYoverse, the company behind several gacha hits, has announced a follow-up to one in Honkai Impact 3rd Part 2. The next step in Honkai Impact 3rd's journey is due to depart in February 2024.\n\n\nWhile many in the western world became familiar with HoYoverse / miHoYo through Genshin Impact, Honkai Impact 3rd was the game that came before, and still holds a solid playerbase throughout its seven-year lifespan. This new chapter, Honkai Impact 3rd Part 2, heads to Mars.\n\n\nCheck out the first look below to get a glimpse at what HoYoverse is cooking up for this new chapter:\n\n\n\n\nIt seems like Honkai Impact 3rd Part 2 is a direct follow-up to the base Honkai Impact 3rd, but in what manner, I'm not sure. HoYoverse looks to be improving the combat, exploration, and more in Part 2, as well as departing on a new story branch of some kind.\n\n\nI've played some Genshin and actually really dug Honkai Star Rail, but 3rd has eluded me a bit. Still, that might make this new release of Honkai Impact 3rd a good jumping-on point. Taking some of the popularity drummed up by Genshin Impact and Honkai Star Rail, and then funneling it back into the two games' predecessor, would be a good play to grab some curious folks already intrigued by HoYoverse's world.\n\n\nA world away\n\n\nStill, Part 2 isn't the only impending HoYoverse title. Alongside updates to Genshin and Star Rail, the company is also still working on Zenless Zone Zero, a stylish action RPG that's been on my radar for a while.\n\n\nHoYoverse recently confirmed that Z3 (as I call it in Slack) is coming to consoles, alongside a PC and mobile version. It's unclear when that might be, exactly, but it's a nice addition.\n\n\nAnd it's another game to add to the growing roster of HoYoverse titles. Keeping up with them all seems like quite a lot, but if you like the look and charm of these games, it sure seems like you won't be hurting for more of them next year.\n\nThe post HoYoverse announces Honkai Impact 3rd Part 2 for February 2024 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Cozy games have carved a chill little niche for themselves, and you don't get much cozier than the Shire. The home of the Hobbits is the subject of a new game from publisher Private Division and developer Weta Workshop. The two paired up to announce Tales of the Shire: A The Lord of the Rings Game, currently planned for 2024. \n\n\nSpecific platforms weren't announced, but the official Twitter is live and lists the game for consoles and PC. You can see a quick live-action preview in the teaser trailer.\n\n\n\n\nPipe-weed dreams\n\n\nThere isn't much in the way of information beyond what little we see in the teaser. Like anything chill and Hobbit-related, the video shows someone putting the finishing touches on some book illustrations. If said book covers another harrowing journey, we're not likely to take any part of that in this quaint entry. The official accounts describe it as a \"cozy The Lord of the Rings game set in the Middle-earth universe.\" \n\n\nThis all follows last August's news of Private Division and Weta Workshop signing a deal for a new game set in Middle-earth. Weta has worked intimately with J.R.R. Tolkien's world, handling effects for Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings films, among many other projects. Now we'll just have to wait to see exactly how relaxing this take on the material will be once it launches.\n\n\nTales of the Shire is just one of the new projects in the works based on The Lord of the Rings. There's also Return to Moria, which will hopefully wipe the taste of Gollum (yuck, sorry) out of everyone's mouths. \n\nThe post Tales of the Shire to show the cozy side of Lord of the Rings in 2024 appeared first on Destructoid.",

He also directed the first Viewtiful Joe game, and then Okami in 2006 at Capcom's Clover Studio. Capcom closed Clover later that year but Platinum had already been somewhat founded under the name Seeds, Inc. It was later renamed Platinum Games and the rest was history. \nKamiya departs from Platinum more than 17 years after he founded it alongside Shinji Mikami, who is no longer there and departed from Tango Gameworks earlier this year, and Atsushi Inaba, who is the studio's CEO.\nWhile waiting to learn what Kamiya is up to next, read Game Informer's review of Bayonetta and then check out our thoughts on The Wonderful 101.

          "description": "With Mortal Kombat 1 on the horizon, we're revisiting the entry that set the series on its current trajectory: 2011's Mortal Kombat (aka MK 9). Join us today on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. Central as we take a bloody journey through the game's genre-defining story campaign. Episodes will be uploaded to our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel the following Saturday morning. \nAfter 2006's Mortal Kombat: Armageddon seemingly concluded the franchise's main narrative, 2011's entry picked up the bloody pieces. It moved the saga forward by resetting the timeline, serving as a soft reboot that brought Mortal Kombat back to its 2D fighting roots and ushering in the return of the classic roster. MK 9's cinematic story mode served as an epiphany for the series and fighting games as a whole, establishing the blueprint for narrative fighting campaigns still utilized today. MK9's story also serves as the first chapter of the modern trilogy of games that Mortal Kombat 1 builds upon. For a whole lot more on MK9 and its development, you can read this feature on how the reboot saved the franchise.\nJoin editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they battle their way through MK 9 to see how its reimagined tournament holds up. \nPart 1 - Surpr-iced! \nPart 2 - Bringing The Smoke\nPart 3 - Staff Meeting\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

The game is coming to Microsoft’s consoles and Windows PC early next year.\nThe RPG was first released to PlayStation consoles, Switch, and PC in February. Octopath Traveler II, like its predecessor, sees players guide eight adventurers across a sprawling adventure in an HD-2D rendered world. Though similar on the surface, the sequel has been praised for its improvements in storytelling, character development, progression, and navigation. \nIn our review, we scored Octopath Traveler II an 8.5 out of 10, with guest writer Josh Broadwell writing that “Octopath Traveler II does what an excellent sequel should. Instead of breaking new ground left and right, it improves on the original in nearly every way and feels more confident about the stories it tells.”",

This release date was revealed in a new gameplay trailer from IGN for Assassin's Creed Nexus VR, which gives us another look at the game's three protagonist assassins: Ezio from Assassin's Creed II, Connor from Assassin's Creed III, and Kassandra from Assassin's Creed Odyssey. \nIn the trailer, we get a look at how combat and parkour will work in the game. As expected, given the game is a VR exclusive title, everything happens from a first-person perspective. As Connor, players will explore 18th Century America during the American Revolution. As Ezio, players will parkour through 15th Century Italy during the Italian Renaissance, and as Kassandra, players will fight as a mercenary assassin through ancient Greece. \nCheck out the Assassin's Creed Nexus VR gameplay trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Assassin's Creed Nexus VR looks pretty much exactly as you'd expect for an Assassin's Creed game in VR. All the assassin tropes are still there, fortunately, like leaps of faith, hidden blades, parkour, and more. \nAssassin's Creed Nexus VR hits Meta Quest devices on November 16. \nWhile waiting for its release, check out this Assassin's Creed Nexus VR trailer from June and then read our preview after checking out more of the game earlier this summer. \nAre you going to check out Assassin's Creed Nexus VR in November?

Luckily, developer Larian Studios has released two major patches to the game, and while the third was set to release today, it's been delayed to tomorrow. In a post on X, the site formerly known as Twitter, the developers announced the patch would be delayed \"to ensure thorough testing.\" This is likely done to avoid the issue they ran into when they had to roll back a hotfix last month.\nWhile we know the patch has been delayed, before now we didn't have much of an idea of what that patch included. While specific bug fixes are still unknown, Larian tweeted about a new feature to expect tomorrow: the ability to change your character's appearance. This includes details like pronouns, voice actor, and specific facial features, but notably does not allow you to change your race, which could alter the story depending on your choice. \nWith Patch 3 comes the Magic Mirror, which lives in your camp and allows you to change your Tav’s appearance whenever you’d like!\npic.twitter.com/LJ6y9CZ58F\nSeptember 21, 2023\nEven though the patch plans have been derailed, Baldur's Gate 3 still launches on Mac today, so if you've been meaning to grab it on that platform, now's the chance to do so. We'd highly recommend it, and you can read about why in our glowing review of the game.

          "description": "After playing Final Fantasy VII Rebirth for the first time (check out my full impressions here), I then spoke with director Naoki Hamaguchi, producer Yoshinori Kitase, and creative director Tetsuya Nomura to seek answers to some burning questions. That includes how much narrative ground Rebirth covers, the decision behind splitting it between two discs, and if there’s any form of data transfer between Remake and Rebirth.\nHow Did Rebirth's Development Compare To Remake's? \nRebirth launches on February 29, a couple of months shy of Remake’s fourth anniversary. According to Hamaguchi, Remake’s development cycle was around four years, making the turnaround for Rebirth, a much larger game, seem relatively quick. It’s especially impressive since Square developed and released the PlayStation 5-ex…",

          "description": "In an announcement I personally never could have predicted, the 2001 PlayStation 2 Capcom video game Onimusha: Warlords (and subsequent sequels) is getting an anime adaption for Netflix. The reveal is surprising for a number of reasons. The franchise is not one that is particularly well-known or currently popular. Also, the anime seems to have little to do with the original game. Protagonist Samanosuke Akechi does not make an appearance in the trailer. But, like Samanosuke, who was modeled after Japanese actor Kaneshiro Takeshi, the anime's protagonist, Miyamoto Musashi, is modeled after the late Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune. Coincidentally, Onimusha 2's protagonist, Jubei Yagyu, was modeled after Japanese actor Yūsaku Matsuda, who had also passed away well before the game released. It's an odd throughline for the series but is a key element.\nThe other surprise for the adaptation is it is being co-directed by Takashi Miike. Miike is known for films like Ichi The Killer and Audition, but he also has another big Capcom franchise under his directorial belt with Ace Attorney, a film adaption of the Phoenix Wright games.\nI played Onimusha for the first time in earnest when it released on Switch and enjoyed revisiting it and finally beating it. You can find more of my thoughts on that topic here.\n\n\nThe anime premieres November 2 on Netflix.",

          "description": "Sega and Like a Dragon series developer Ryu Ga Gotoku (RGG) Studio held a presentation this morning sharing all kinds of new details for its upcoming games, Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth and Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name.\nFirst up, it shared a 10-minute story trailer for Infinite Wealth, which shared so many details that I am hesitant to write them all here in fear of spoiling potentially major plot beats in the game. The summary is that Ichiban Kasuga is offered the opportunity to find his mother, which means he must travel to Honolulu, Hawaii. Returning characters make an appearance, Ichiban will apparently be fighting sharks and giant squids, taking part in fun Hawaii activities like surfing, and, expectedly, will be getting into all kinds of trouble with the local gangs. Kazamu Kiryu's role also gets somewhat defined in the trailer.\n\n\nSome details not in the trailer include the fact that the playable party now has full freedom of movement while fighting, allowing for more strategy. The game includes a Crazy Taxi-inspired minigame, among many other money-making opportunities. Actors Danny Trejo (Machete) and Daniel Dae Kim (Lost) will also be playing Dwight, the leader of the Barracudas gang, and Masataka Ebina, the ruthless captain of the local yakuza syndicate, respectively. You can check out some additional screenshots for the game below.\n\nAlongside the story trailer, there is also a five-minute gameplay trailer.\n\n\nArguably, the biggest news from the event, however, is Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth's release date, which isn't far off. The game releases January 26 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, and PC. Preorders for the game will net you the Hero’s Booster Pack, to level up faster, and a Special Job Set that includes the Linebacker and Tennis Ace jobs.\nAlongside all the Infinite Wealth details, Sega and RGG also released the full opening cinematic for Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, which you can watch below.",

It's how we learned Xbox head Phil Spencer considered acquiring Nintendo and Warner Bros. Games at one point, that Xbox is planning an Xbox Series X/S refresher for next year, that it might be working on remasters of Fallout 3 and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, and that Microsoft has plans for a next-gen hybrid console in 2028. \nThe leaks were quite extensive, and after some online confusion, we learned via Bloomberg that Microsoft accidentally provided federal courts with confidential (and not redacted) documents. Following news of these leaks, Spencer has now addressed what’s happened with a brief statement on Twitter. \nWe've seen the conversation around old emails and documents.

We will share the real plans when we are ready.\nSeptember 19, 2023\nHe shared that on Twitter, but The Verge has obtained a more in-depth memo sent to Xbox employees. Here it is, in full: \nSomething of note, especially for those particularly excited about something that might have leaked today, is that in both the internal memo to Xbox employees and the public-facing statement posted to Twitter, Spencer says these leaked documents and email are old and plans have changed. He also says the team will share \"the real plans\" when ready. Now, he obviously can't say the leaked information is what's happening and must downplay it as a result, but it's also a reminder to take everything that has come to light with a grain of salt because it's very likely plans have changed.\n[Source: The Verge]",

One of the most important elements in achieving that is through music, and while the Star Wars sound is iconic and well-known, a good video game score has to be more than just an imitation of what came before. The music for Jedi: Survivor was written by Stephen Barton and Gordy Haab, and when I ask them what makes a good video game soundtrack, they answer in unison.\n\"Emotional weight.\"\nOur interview is done on a video call with each composer …",

The big news is that the update is coming this winter.\n\n\nMore immediately, we finally got confirmation that \"Separate Ways\" is coming to RE4. For the uninitiated, Separate Ways was a side campaign starring, you guessed it, Ada Wong, initially released with the PlayStation 2 and all subsequent versions of the original Resident Evil 4. Separate Ways will be released next week, on September 21.\nMoreover, Both Ada Wong and Albert Wesker will be made available as playable characters in the Mercenaries game mode.\nFor more Resident Evil 4 Remake, check out our review.\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story mistakenly identified \"Separate Ways\" as \"Assignment Ada.\" We regret the error.",

The publishers can't currently identify the site's operators but believe they are likely based overseas. Citing  \"staggering\" levels of infringement, the companies are seeking damages and an order that will allow them to seize the site's domains or put them out of action.\nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",

          "description": "Dark Side, the exciting sequel of the groundbreaking Driller, is ready for public testing!\nDark Side, like its predecessor, was released by Incentive Software Limited in 1988, shortly after Driller. The updated gameplay features a jetpack that allows you to leave the ground, providing a new and fresh perspective that emphasizes the excitement and challenges of exploring Tricuspid, the second alien moon of planet Evath.\nThis time, the vicious Ketars have scattered and hidden Energy Collection Devices (ECD) around their base to destroy your home planet. It’s up to you to destroy them first! The tricky part is many ECDs are connected to each other and can regenerate instantly, so you must figure out the right order to successfully complete your mission. \nOur reimplementation of the Freescape engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Dark Side support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC. Additionally, there are two playable demos if you want to test the game. Support for Amiga and AtariST will be available later! Please contact us if you have some other release.\nTo play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.\n>",

Since Lars Sundström, aka lman, joined our team as the iOS porter, we have made significant progress. Thus, you no longer need to compile ScummVM yourself in order to add it to your iOS or iPadOS device. \nIf you want to help by testing this version, just follow this Testflight link and enroll yourself in the test program. This may require installing Apple’s Testflight app. You can find instructions on how to install games and how to play them on our documentation portal.\nWe truly appreciate your feedback. You can share your thoughts with the Testflight feedback feature, where you can attach screenshots and post detailed descriptions. Alternatively, you can use our bugtracker, e-mail us at ios@scummvm.org, or post on our Discord Server. Your help will let us eventually add ScummVM to the App Store.\n>",

These versions were produced by Tetraedge and are built on a completely different engine than the original Windows versions; basically, they are reimplementations, not ports. Now, thanks to the folks from ZOOM-Platform, you can easily obtain these game variants.\n>",
