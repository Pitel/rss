Then I hit some puzzles and thought, \"Ain't no kid figuring this out\".\nThen it hit me. It struggles to balance the fine line between being approachable for tiny tots and layered enough for people who've graduated from \"goo goo ga ga\" to \"oo oo aa aa my back hurts\".

UFO 50 is a kart of 50 games that once existed for an old computer system, all lovingly restored by a gang of coders. The old console, of course, is a fiction. The LX-I never existed. But it's a fun pseudo-history against which to create a grab bag of small games (some throwaway, others mighty) all designed with a distinct 80s look. It's an exercise in adhering to an aesthetic. Like an oil painter working with a limited range of colours, the developers of this bundle have stuck to a 32-colour equivalent of the Zorn palette. Yet play a little of each game, and you start to sense the smirk of chronos. These games aren't stuck in the past, but they are enjoying a holiday there. \nRead more",

          "description": "Why is every blockbuster video game now some kind of live service game? Speaking as a clueless idiot, the explanation I find most convincing is that it's an attempt to bridge the gap between the returns publishers want from video games, versus how much we're able or willing to pay upfront. \"Triple-A\" projects now cost exorbitant sums to develop, partly thanks to wider economic inflation, but also because publishers have spent decades teaching players that every sequel has to be More and Shinier. Premium game prices have not risen in proportion, and investors want growth, as they do.\nLive service games sneak around this difficulty by dragging out the time we spend playing them. Whether premium or free-to-play, they seek to install themselves as habits by means of regular, planned updates and additions. This is time that can be monetised by way of a subscription model, time in which other products may be sold to you, like skins and paintjobs, and time that becomes a commodity in itself, \"engagement\", which can be transmuted and exploited to various end. I'm not sure it's ever been expressed this way in any press release boast about longevity, but the unspoken principle/logical extrapolation seems to be that ideally, a live service game should keep us plugged in and plugging away till we die.\n Read more",

          "description": "Strange Scaffold’s newly released FPS I Am Your Beast is very fun for quite a few reasons, but chief among them is a deep appreciation for the poetry of good videogame violence. I’m not using the big P word just to throw out an overly worthy comparison to something we might associate with craft or beauty, but as a nod toward the game’s playful application of what I previously called ‘a euphoric splurge of murderous game verbiage’ one morning where I had clearly eaten my wordy Weetabix. The way its hurled knives and curb stomps and inexplicable decapitations flow together have an assonant, almost Suessian quality to them.\nBut it’s also, well, just a bit like Mad Libs. You play as Harding, a man who’s mythical lethality is established very early on. The showing is there in the moment to moment, but the telling is conveyed through cute tricks like how everyone you meet is so deeply afraid of Harding that they loudly keep track of exactly what weapon he’s holding at all times. The Mad Libs comes in through the fact that you can draw Harding a route between A and B, and it’s a given that multiple heads are going to come unstuck from necks along the way. You’re sort of just casually filling in the verbs that seem the most fun to you in the moment. One of the verbs is ‘hornet’. Hornet is a verb now.\nRead more",

          "description": "In theory, vampires and immersive sims go together as naturally as bats and caves. Immersive sims tend to involve a balance of stealth, acrobatics, raw strength and crafty manipulation, and vampires are celebrated for all of these things. Despite this, actual vampire-themed immersive sims are rare. My list starts with Vampire: the Masquerade: Bloodlines... and sort of ends there. In a devastating betrayal, Arkane Austin's Redfall wasn't an immersive sim but an open world co-op shooter (a not very good one). The much-delayed Bloodlines 2 was recently downgraded from immersive sim to RPG by new developers The Chinese Room. Arkane Lyon's Blade adaptation seems promising, but it's a ways off. \r\n\n\r\nHere to paper over the immersive vamping gap in the market is Byte Barrel's Trust, \"a new first-person shooter with immersive sim elements\". It takes place in a world where the vampires are hunted for their blood, which has become an everyday human energy source, used for everything from car batteries to streetlights. The irony! I feel like, in the circumstances, the ideal solution would be for humans to let vampires suck their blood in return for vampires letting humans use their blood for electricity, but that wouldn't make for a very thrilling shooter. Anyway, here's the trailer.\r\n \nRead more",

We hope that the developers will treat us to a free-to-play weekend, in which our perhaps-unfounded reservations might be strategically offset by the endorphin rush of not having paid any goddamn money.

          "description": "There are many reasons to play and write about Arco. The Mesoamerican pixelart landscapes, for example - radiant, cloud-hung platters of land with people and buildings reduced to daubs of paint in the foreground. The fact that it's about witnessing and surviving colonial invasion, rather than the more familiar European or North American video game fantasy of searching a New World for plunder.\nThe ensemble storytelling, with four, successively playable characters setting their own lenses to thickly entangled themes of sorrow, vengeance and growing understanding. The sparse, expressive dialogue, each phrase carefully tucked inside its speech bubble. The music. And the little things at the level of how you move, what you do. When you pick a faraway destination on your map, your character makes the journey screen by screen, which gives you a second to lean back and be a passenger, watching the horizon, at least until you're ambushed by a giant beetle. \r\n \nRead more",

One that favours the joyous freeform sightseeing of an Elden Ring or Breath Of The Wild; where you’ll scramble up vast industrial concrete ruins on scavenging missions for inquisitive frogs, instead of being nagged by bothersome checklists?\nOk, rain check on that last point. SandWitch can’t help but eventually funnel the freedom of ambling around in your chuffy yellow van into restrictive collect-a-thons. Still, for much of its breezy runtime, this one’s a real panacea for gaming’s more bloated map-scourers. Plus, even when you are sent off to hamster-cheek scavenged components before making progress, there’s very little in this world that doesn’t feel intentional. Sidequests and storytelling crumbs are deliberately scattered throughout, and each building is a thoughtful concrete puzzle box. It is, in brief, a nice time.\nYou play as Sauge, a spacefarer returned to her planet of Cigalo after receiving a distress signal from her missing sister. Cigalo’s a cheery place, though economically and environmentally devastated after being exploited by an evil spacecorp named The Consortium. It’s populated by small settlements of people, some large talking frogs named the Reinetos, and the occasional friendly robot. Everything’s friendly, as it goes - even gravity itself. There’s no danger, no death, no damage from flinging yourself off the tallest building you can find. Just helping out your desert buds, upgrading your van with more gadgets to solve puzzles, or working on finding exactly where Sauge’s sister has go to.\n Read more",

But then you find an outlaw buddy who offers a new way to shoot human dirtbags. Then another fellow bandit. And another. By the time your spaceship is half-filled with scoundrels and weirdoes shouting at each other, the game has warmed up enough to reveal its central idea. This ain't no grand FPS campaign, nor is it quick as roguelikes go. It's a snacky shootout sim with tumbleweed towns that feels best when you savour the pre-fight suspense.\nRead more",

          "description": "As an existing fan of the Two Point games, I’m very excited for Two Point Museum. It’s nice to have a release date, but Sega and Two Point Studios have announced that the release date is set for March 4th, 2025. That's sort of far off. Maybe if I freeze myself…\n\n\nI didn’t know this even existed until last month, but already the wait has been too long. I yearn for the hapless puppet inhabitants of Two Point County. The upcoming game has you managing a museum, and while it certainly has a lot that harkens back to Two Point Hospital and Two Point Campus, a lot has been changed to make it a fresh experience. I briefly got to touch it, but that has done little to settle my brain.\n\n\nIf you’re not familiar, Two Point Museum is a management game where you’re tasked with running museums. You send out explorers to gather/dig up/steal artifacts and then display them in a way that will convince patrons to empty their pockets into the donation bins.\n\n\n\n\nSega has also announced that preorders will be open starting today, and you’ll get some exclusive items for plunking down money in advance. It’s Sonic the Hedgehog-themed stuff, including Sonic and Shadow outfits for your staff, plushies for your gift shop, and wallpaper, flooring, and statues if your museum needs that touch of marketing. That might all sound weird, but Hospital and Campus both had this sort of product placement. I think someone on staff is a fan since they worked in a Crazy Taxi 3 arcade machine in Campus, for some reason.\n\n\nThere’s also a deluxe “Explorers Edition” which sounds totally Sega. Purchasing that gives you 5 days early access, an exclusive map location, a “pop up challenge museum,” explorer items and cosmetics, and 5000 Kudosh (secondary currency in the game). That sucks, but this is pretty common for Sega deluxe editions.\n\n\nRegardless of your purchasing decision, Two Point Museum is out on March 4, 2025 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. \n\nThe post Two Point Museum is out in March and that’s not soon enough appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "If you've completed the first three Foundations set in EA FC 25, Foundations 4 SBC might not be a hard challenge.\n\n\nThat said, this will be the first time when you'll need to manage player chemistry while submitting a squad. Additionally, you'll also have to keep the nationalities and leagues of the items in mind. Hence, the task is much more complex compared to much simpler challenges like the Foundations 2 SBC.\n\n\nEA FC 25 Foundations 4 SBC tasks\n\n\nLike the three previous sets, Foundations 4 SBC has four different tasks.\n\n\nTask 1 - Hybrid Chemistry 1\n\n\n\nExact 3 Players from the same League\n\n\nExact 3 Players from the same Nation\n\n\n\nTask 2 - Hybrid Chemistry 2\n\n\n\nExact 3 Players from the same League\n\n\nExact 3 Players from the same Club\n\n\n\nTask 3 - Hybrid Chemistry 3\n\n\n\nExact 2 Players from the same Club\n\n\nExact 2 Players from the same Nation\n\n\n\nTask 4 - 10 Chemistry\n\n\n\nMin. Squad Total Chemistry Points: 10\n\n\n\nThere's no set solution, and it's best to use the cards you already have. Hybrid Chemistry 1 and 2 are pretty similar- the first one requires you to use items from the same nation, while the second one requires the use of items from the same league. If you use players in their correct positions, completing the challenges won't be an issue.\n\n\nThe hardest one to complete is 10 Chemistry. You'll need to make a squad of 5 items and achieve 10 chemistry points. The easiest way to do that is to ensure that any 4 items have the same nation and league. That way, the fifth item becomes a surplus, and this is the easiest way to achieve 10 chemistry points.\n\nThe post EA FC 25: How to complete Foundations 4 SBC appeared first on Destructoid.",

Here's a demo solution you could use to complete the SBC but make sure not to go splurging out all your coins immediately.\n\n\n\nStarke ST 77\n\n\nKossler ST 79\n\n\nMonaghan LW 75\n\n\nWeatherholt CDM 77\n\n\nDougherty Howard CM 75\n\n\nBeste LM 78\n\n\nLuhrben LB 75\n\n\nLind CB 79\n\n\nKleinherne CB 80\n\n\nDydasco RB 78\n\n\nBarnhart GK 75\n\n\n\nThe main focus is to go heavy on any two leagues and use filler items to complete the remaining spots.

The release also reiterates a statement provided by Nintendo earlier this year in which Nintendo indicated that it will continue to take necessary actions against any infringement of its intellectual property rights including the Nintendo brand itself, to protect the intellectual properties it has worked hard to establish over the years.\n\n\nPalworld released in Early Access in January this year and sold over a million copies in just 8 hours. By the end of January Palworld had surpassed 19 million total players, becoming one of the fastest-selling games on Steam of all time.\n\n\nThis story is still developing and may be updated in real time as more details become available.\n\nThe post Nintendo and The Pokemon Company sue Palworld developer appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The light machine gun collection gains a powerful addition with the debut of the Kastov LSW in Season 6. Armed with this weapon, you'll transform into an unstoppable force thanks to its formidable fire rates and precision.\n\n\nIf you're ready to take your Kastov LSW to the next level, we'll guide you to the best loadout for MW3 and Warzone, allowing you to adapt to any situation.\n\n\nWhat is the best Kastov LSW loadout in MW3 and Warzone?\n\n\nBy equipping the following attachments, you'll create the best Kastov LSW loadout in Warzone and Modern Warfare 3:\n\n\n\nOptic: Jak Glassless Optic\n\n\nRear Grip: Weave-L7 Grip\n\n\nBarrel: Elevator D20 Long Barrel\n\n\nUnderbarrel: XTEN Phantom-5 Handstop\n\n\nMuzzle: Quartermaster Suppressor\n\n\n\nYou can start improving the Kastov LSW's range with the Elevator D20 Long Barrel. This attachment helps with the LMG's default short to medium scope, permitting it to reach far distances.\n\n\nEven with these attachments, you'll still need to revamp the Kastov LSW's recoil control. Use the Spetsnaz S15 Stock and Quartermaster Suppressor to compensate for this disadvantage. Plus, the muzzle makes you undetectable by radar when firing the weapon.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThe Weave-L7 Grip will be the last attachment that assists with recoil control. Although it decreases Aiming Idle Sway, it isn't as major as some other equipment. Now, you can end it all off with the best Optic in the game: the Jak Glassless. Almost all best-of builds take advantage of this attachment, including the new DTIR 30-06 Battle Rifle.\n\n\nFortunately, the Kastov LSW will always harness exceptional fire rates, no matter what. After all, it is a light machine gun, so there is no need to attach extended ammo capacities. The LMG also works well for Tac Stance takedowns, which can be helpful for medium-range attacks or Warzone's larger map sizes.\n\nThe post Best Kastov LSW loadout in MW3 and Warzone appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The For the Club Challenge SBC is currently available in EA FC 25, and it's a great way to earn some cheap fodder for your Ultimate Team squad.\n\n\nLike all fodder challenges, For the Club Challenge SBC can be completed pretty easily. It only requires a 70-rated squad with 10 chemistry. But you'll need to use items from multiple leagues, and it might not be the easiest task at the start of a new game.\n\n\nEA FC 25 For the Club Challenge SBC tasks\n\n\nThe For the Club Challenge SBC, thankfully, has a single task. Let's take a look at its requirements.\n\n\nTask 1 - For the Club Challenge SBC\n\n\n\nMin. Leagues in Squad: 3\n\n\nMax. 5 Players from the same League\n\n\nMin. 2 Players from the same Club\n\n\nMin. Team Rating: 70\n\n\nMin. Squad Total Chemistry Points: 10\n\n\n\nThis SBC is best solved using your Silver players, as it will be slightly naïve to use all your Gold cards. It's too early, and the market doesn't have enough movement to determine what can be the cheapest solution. However, here's a great strategy you could employ.\n\n\n\n\nYou'll want to use five cards from one league and evenly distribute the remaining two leagues. Make sure to use at least two items that share the same club between them. If you follow this, you won't have to bother too much about the squad chemistry.\n\n\nEA FC 25 For the Club Challenge SBC rewards\n\n\nAfter completing this SBC, you'll unlock a Small Electrum Players Pack. This is an untradeable pack, so you can't sell the items. Usually, a Small Electrum Players Pack doesn't hand out great rewards, but then again, it's the start of Ultimate Team. If you can find a decent 82+ card from it in exchange for fodder you won't need, it's not a bad trade-off at all.\n\nThe post EA FC 25: How to complete For the Club Challenge SBC appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Almost every page of The Plucky Squire involves a puzzle in one way or another, often leaving you boggling with its mysteries. You'll likely have encountered this during Chapter 2, where a stack of books will block you off. Here's how to solve the book puzzle in The Plucky Squire.\n\n\nThe Plucky Squire Chapter 2 book puzzle solution\n\n\nTo make The Plucky Squire book puzzle more accessible, eliminate the nearby foes first. They'll electrify you if you get too close, so use your throwing sword attack to keep your distance. Go to the left side to collect a key, triggering another enemy attack (get rid of them to open the door). An Art Scroll, a valuable addition to your gallery collection, is also hidden in the bottom-left corner. Traverse through the stacked books to grab it.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nUse the key to open the blue door in the restricted area on the right. Hit and pick up the word 'Scattered' and switch it with the word 'Stacked' from the sentence in the center. Once you place down 'Scattered,' the perfectly stacked books will be out of your way. But now, you'll see a gap preventing you from getting across.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThat's why you'll also need to use 'Stacked' with the wordings in the upper-right corner to produce a platform of papers. Ultimately, both sentences should be: 'Pages were stacked on the ground' and 'These books had been purposefully scattered.'\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nPush the stack of papers into the hole to walk across it, thus solving the book puzzle in The Plucky Squire Chapter 2. After this, you'll move onto a unique new stage that'll usher in a surprise. Chop down any trees here to gain some light bulbs, which can be exchanged for rewards at the store. As you may expect, there will be many more puzzles to complete, so check out our guides on all achievements or Chapter 5's pig locations for additional help.\n\nThe post How to solve book puzzle in The Plucky Squire Chapter 2 appeared first on Destructoid.",
