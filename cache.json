He’s found himself stuck in a mansion, investigating the strange happenings within it and why he seems to be trapped in it. Paper Cut Mansion is all about uncovering the truth behind the unusual surroundings and surviving long enough to make it to the next floor. There is an attempt to spice up the typical roguelite formula with unique visuals and setting, but the game falls short of greatness by not polishing up those changes enough.\nThe first thing that you’ll notice about Paper Cut Mansion is the visuals, which are a strange creepy papercraft aesthetic that gives powerful Corpse Bride or Psychonauts vibes throughout. The jazzy soundtrack and occasional musical number that plays as you make your way through the levels of the mansion only add to this feeling. The art design is fantastic and is easily the part of the game that stands out from the plethora of roguelites on Switch.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Hold the jump button and you even charge up a big boosted power charge. Jump off the land and press sprint and you'll dive, briefly powering through the water before smashing out again.

The talking alien guns weren't that irritating and the gun fights seemed solid! And it appealed to my juvenile sense of humour too. Poo and wee? Yeah, you'll get a cheap chuckle from me. I understood then that it might not be for everyone, but hey, I can roll with that if the FPS bit is good.\nHaving now spent a few hours with the final game, I've concluded that my mind must've been chemically altered by the doner kebab I consumed the night before. You can switch off your gun's verbal diarrhea through the in-game menu, but what you'll find behind the brown curtain is a very unimaginative shooter. For a world so colourful and zaney, it's a shame the FPS side can't match it.\nRead more",

I thought it had potential, but it's difficult to determine just how much potential something has when all you've got to go on is footage they'd prepared earlier, like a cottage pie from a Sunday Brunch oven.\nI'm excited to report that I spent over an hour with the game alongside Shiny Shoe's CEO Mark Cooke and creative director Andrew Krausnick, who were not only lovely but put up with my incredible ability to fumble my turns. Still, I was impressed by how the game's speedy combat matched its roguelike needs, as it pushed us through even the trickiest of scenarios - as opposed to other strategy games which can feel like trudging through a sea of glue.\nRead more",

It’s a grisly co-op multiplayer where instead of brawling your way through torrents of gross rat humanoids, you and your rag-tag team are now up against hordes of scabby zombies all in favour of a Imperial fascist overlord.\nSeveral of the RPS Treehouse folk have jumped into the fray, carving their way through Darktide’s industrial world of Gothic factories and towering cathedrals. The verdict? Uninspiring progression systems and short, repetitive missions aside, Darktide still remains a bone-crunching gorefest best enjoyed with pals. Preferably ones with strong stomachs.\nJames: I was actually braced to bounce off this, in the same way I bounced off Vermintide 2 and its monotonously melee-focused ratman slaughter. Nope – I’m 22 hours in and not even close to abandoning interest in my greasy crew of Imperial screwups. I think it might be because Darktide strikes a finer balance of slicing and shooting? Like there’s more of a dynamism to horde fights when you’re switching between the two.

Namely that FF7 hero and perpetual mopey boy Cloud Strife wasn't quite who he thought he was, and that he actually owes a lot of his life (literally and figuratively) to the peppy, squat-loving ShinRa go-getter Zack Fair. (And if you're mad about me spoiling that 25-year-old story beat, wait until you see what they've done with FF7 Remake).\nIt's with FF7 Remake in mind, though, that many of you will probably be wondering where this swanky new remaster of FF7's PSP prequel fits into the increasingly up for grabs timeline of Squeenix's ongoing Remake trilogy. And just as the original Crisis Core was almost impossible to talk about without entering major spoiler territory for the main game of Final Fantasy VII, so it goes for Crisis Core - Final Fantasy VII - Reunion. For the spoiler-averse, I'll say this. If you don't already know the backstory of Zack and his relationship with arch mega villain Sephiroth, this is a perfectly fine action game that's received a lot of welcome polish for a 15-year old PSP title, but is probably still best experienced through a comprehensive YouTube retrospective as opposed to forking out £40 / $50 for it.

They say Christmas is a season for cheer and goodwill towards all but that's not an observation, it's an imploration. Christmas can be difficult for so many reasons, and that is why we must offer people cheer and goodwill. So truly, genuinely I find great comfort and joy in Christmas Pain In Christmas Town, a novelty Christmas song by a fictional washed-up musician from 90s infobahn detective game Hypnospace Outlaw. May this music video bring you cheer too.\nRead more",

It's not super secret, but I almost don't want to say more than that, because this is a game overflowing with possibilities in a way that even Fallout seldom matched.

And let me tell you, the lead-up to a night like The Game Awards is always something else. Fringes of the Tomb Raider fanbase were getting hyped for the announcement of the next game because… well, it just feels like about time, right? The same went for Life Is Strange, but then, Life Is Strange fans have been predicting the imminent reveal of LIS3 literally on a weekly basis ever since True Colors launched, so they're bound to be right eventually. Ace Attorney stans were using numerology to predict that AA7 would finally get announced. Incredible scenes of completely baseless hype, and despite myself, I wanted to believe.\nI genuinely daren't check in on any of those conversations today, because, honestly, it wasn't a massive night for long-running franchises, and I don't think I can handle the lamentations. And, while I'll admit that my initial skim of the trailers for familiar names came up a tad short, I'm not at all disappointed, because it looks like 2023 is going to be a stellar year for devs doing something cool with a new IP while learning a lot from their older projects.\nRead more",

          "description": "Speaking as a grown-ass man, I love trains. Not to the extent that I will ever bother to learn anything about them, or to identify one with any more specificity than “the pointy type”, “the blunt type” and “the chugga chugga choo choo all-aboard type”, but to the far milder extent that I simply enjoy watching them whizz around the place like big metal worms, and hearing their various little noises and honks. It’s trains! \nJust as a train might be lured into a station with the promise of fresh passengers (which are like treats to trains), I have been drawn inexorably toward Choo-Choo Charles, a ramshackle joke-game about a scary train that chases you around. Marooned on a perpetually dark island, you’re stalked by a monstrous locomotive with a set of great big spider legs and an unquenchable thirst for human blood. \nRead more",

          "description": "In the same way that shoulderpads sometimes become cool again, and everyone is buying over-sized hair scrunchies like wot I used to have when I was 11, games journalists are destined to be trapped in repeating discourse cycles of ever-decreasing size. This is why I will often specifically advise people to never, ever pitch me opinions about BioShock. Any opinions about BioShock have already been had. There are no more opinions to have about it.\r\n\r\nMy state of peace in this area was just scuppered by that utter bastard Ken Levine, the creative director and writing lead on both BioShock and BioShock Infinite, when he revealed some of the new game by his studio Ghost Story Games (aka The Developers Formerly Known As Irrational). As observed by everyone who saw the reveal at The Game Awards last night, Judas is basically BioShock in space. The bad news is that this will put more fuel in Thomas The Take Engine, but the good news is that, if it is indeed like BioShock, we can save ourselves a lot of time. When Judas comes out please just return to this article and insert a specific title and delete options as applicable.\n Read more",

This time around we'll be playing as Melinoë, modelled after the Greek goddess of nightmares and madness. She's also Zag's half-sister — yet another of the dozens of children, step-children, and foster-children of Hades knocking about the place — which brings me to my main take-away from the newly-confirmed existence of a Hades sequel: the title character is a really bad dad.\nRead more",

Looks like a lot of familiar faces will be turning up.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_VMGv2kKEI\nThen, at the end of the trailer, we see some of the Paldea region Pokemon from Pokemon Scarlet and Violet.

          "description": "Do you eat whole lemons or pure salt?\nNintendo has dropped the details for the first Splatoon 3 splatfest of 2023! The next battle of squid kids and octolings will kick off in the first weekend of January, and will see players fight it out in another weekend of colorful chaos — hoping to bring home the gong for their team and bag themselves some exclusive rewards.\nThis time around, the topic is — quite literally — a matter of taste, as players will have to choose which is their favorite food flavoring. The options on the dinner table are Spicy, Sweet, and Sour, (a topic that sound suspiciously familiar, and I'm pretty sure that they've re-run the fun for this particular splatfest). It's also worth noting that spicy is a sensation and not a taste ACKSHUALLY. I feel sorry for anybody not on Team Sweet, as I have a feeling the public vote is gonna be running away with this one.\nSo far, Splatoon 3 hosts Big Man and Shiver have both secured Splatfest wins, but poor old Frye is yet to capture glory. Maybe January's event will see her finally crack that losing streak (watch her get Team Sour). The Taste Bud Turf War will commence worldwide on Friday January 6 (North America) and Saturday January 7 (Europe) and will conclude 48 hours later. We'll be sure to give y'all a reminder!\nSplatoon 3 is available now on Nintendo Switch.\nhttps://twitter.com/NintendoEurope/status/1603676732036468736?s=20&t=sZ4kDT5zLu2CJr1c6RZvvQ\nThe post January’s Splatoon 3 splatfest is a question of taste, literally appeared first on Destructoid.",

Well, you have another chance!\nThe event is back on as of last night (December 15), and will run through the afternoon/evening of December 18 (US).

If you received an invite to the second beta, or if you previously partook in the October beta, then you should now be able to download the SF6 Beta client on PS5, PC, or Xbox Series X respectively.\nBetween now and Monday, the lucky participants will be able to let loose in a truncated version of the upcoming sequel. Much like the first beta, there are eight selectable characters, (Ryu, Ken, Chun-Li, Guile, Juri, Kimberly, Luke, and Jamie) and six available stages. Players can take the opportunity to build a custom character, check out the Battle Hub, play some Capcom classics, and jump into training while they wait for an online opponent. The comedic \"Extreme Battle\" mode always makes its return.\nThe Street Fighter 6 second closed beta will end Monday, December 19 at 00:00 UTC.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilw0xDkfk2Q&t=1s&ab_channel=StreetFighter\nIf you were not fortunate enough to receive a beta, whether you were creating wholesome content or otherwise, then I understand your frustration and disappointment. However, it is incredibly likely that Capcom will hold further betas, (very likely open betas), between now and the game's official launch in June 2023. I know it sucks not to receive access, I've felt that pain with other games, but I'm sure you'll be jumping into battle with everybody else at some point in early 2023.\nStreet Fighter 6 launches on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox July 2, 2023. Be sure to check out our other reports on the sequel, including my 50 things I loved about the beta feature, as well as CJ Andriessen’s experience with the \"Modern\" control system.

The team at Motive Studio have just completed the final step before release: they've gone gold! For those who may not know, this simply means that the team has finalized a version of the game that they're happy with, and sent it off to begin the physical manufacturing process to be made into discs, and to get the digital version ready to go up on its various platforms. It's a huge milestone at the end of the development process, and while it doesn't necessarily guarantee the game will come out on its announced release date, it's a good sign that there likely won't be a delay between now and January 27. Woohoo!\nhttps://twitter.com/MotiveStudio/status/1603480192755851278\nThe studio took to Twitter to announce their gold status, announcing \"WE ARE WHOLE AGAIN\" to the entire world. Nothing like an ominous yet celebratory tweet to get me in the mood for some spooky space adventures. I admittedly didn't play the original Dead Space series out of fear, but now that I'm getting better with horror games, I'm thinking this time it's gonna be worth a shot.\nMotive Studio was created by Jade Raymond, an executive known for helping to create the Assassin's Creed and Watch Dogs series, under the larger EA umbrella. Motive created two games within the Star Wars franchise in 2017 and 2020, Battlefront II and Squardons, before deciding to shift their focus back to the beloved Dead Space series. In addition to the remake, Motive also announced that they're working on an Untitled Iron Man game for Marvel, which should be interesting to see as it will likely come around near the same time as Insomniac's Wolverine adaptation.\nDead Space will be available for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S on January 27, 2023.\nThe post The Dead Space remake has gone gold ahead of its January release date appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's currently set to launch in Japan sometime in 2023.\nAccording to a description of the game (thanks Gematsu), Ys X: Nordics will once again follow hero Adol Christin in a new adventure, this time set in the northern Obelia Bay. There are many islands and sea-faring people here, as well as some immortal undead who like to attack humans.\nYs X: Nordics will also let the player control a ship, for the first time in the series. Considering Adol's history with boats, it might not be a wise idea to put him at the helm. But hey, maybe the ship won't wreck this time.\n\nFighting in tandem\nBattles look otherwise very action-y and flashy, as you would expect from a Ys game. The new Cross Action system will allow the player to fight in two modes: Solo Mode lets you control one fighter with automatic attacks and support from a partner, while Combination Mode has the player simultaneously controlling both characters for a series of actions.\nNothing's been formally announced about an English localization just yet. We have eventually received previous entries in the Ys series though, like Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana and Ys IX: Monstrum Nox.

          "description": "We've missed you, Spidey\nAs part of an end-of-year post from PlayStation, Marvel's Spider-Man developer Insomniac has returned to give us the newest update on the game's sequel: a release window. The PlayStation blog is meant to highlight the platform's upcoming highlights for the new year, and what better way to start it off than with Insomniac's announcement that Spider-Man 2 will be coming in fall of 2023. Okay, so that's a pretty big window, and there's always the chance that the game could be delayed. At the very least, though, it's nice to that development is coming along nicely and, for now, we can expect to play the game by the end of next year.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIQ3xNqkVC4\nInsomiac's 2018 title Spider-Man, and its follow-up, Spider-Man: Miles Morales, are some of the best-loved games to come out of the last console generation. Based on the swinging mechanics alone, I have to agree. I've never played a game that made me feel more like a superhero, and I've been known to return to the game even after completing it just to swing my way around Manhattan. While Marvel had already taken over the box office, Insomniac secured the studio's hold on the newest console generation with the best superhero games since the Arkham series.\nI think it's safe to say that Spider-Man 2 has been one of the most anticipated upcoming titles out there, so getting confirmation that it's on the way is going to be a huge boost for fans. We've got plenty to keep us busy in the mean time with all of the awesome releases headed our way in the first half of 2023 (I'm personally keeping an eye on Breath of the Wild: Tears of the Kingdom and Hades II), but I think it's safe to say that when Spider-Man 2 finally drops, we're ready to drop everything to slip back into the suit of our Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man.\nThe post Insomniac’s Spider-Man 2 is swinging into action fall of 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Everything is now available with in-game currency. I always want to give games more chances, and I often feel bad for games that are deemed \"bad\" by everyone, so I figured it was time to try Kingdom Hearts Dark Road again. I downloaded the game once more and played it front-to-back, and I purchased and upgraded every …",

The new multiplatform entry in the story of Lara Croft will receive support and publishing help from Amazon.\nThe announcement today confirms Crystal Dynamics' newest partner on the project, following the studio getting acquired by the Embracer Group. The press release also confirms this will be a single-player, narrative-driven Lara Croft adventure. Crystal Dynamics will continue to develop, while Amazon provides support and globally publishes the still-unnamed Tomb Raider.\n\"Crystal Dynamics has an extraordinary opportunity following our acquisition by Embracer to redefine what a publishing relationship is for Tomb Raider,\" said Crystal Dynamics head Scot Amos in a press release. \"Transformative is what we’re looking for, and with Amazon Games, we found a team that shares our creative vision, ambitions, and values for a Lara Croft universe across the spectrum of possibilities.\"\nThe new Tomb Raider is also being built in Unreal Engine 5. Lara's new adventure is still in early development, but today's news promises there will still be enemies to take down and puzzles to solve in the new Tomb Raider.\nA new benefactor\nFor Amazon, the online shopping giant picks up another publishing deal with this project. Bandai Namco's Blue Protocol is also joining up with Amazon for publishing, helping the online RPG launch sometime next year.\nMeanwhile, for Crystal Dynamics, the deal ensures some support for the next big Croft game.

Players on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox can download a truncated version of the title for free to check out its hi-octane action.\nThe trial kicks off today and will run until Monday, December 19 at 10:00 PT / 13:00 ET / 18:00 BST. During that time, squaddies can check out a variety of Modern Warfare II multiplayer modes including Team Deathmatch, Domination, Hardpoint, and, my own personal specialty, Kill Confirmed. Three maps will be made available for digital pew-pew desires — namely Farm 18, El Asilo, and the recently added battlezone, Shipment, which features a ton of containers and blind corners for all your hide 'n' seek needs.\nLaunching in October of this year, Modern Warfare II was mostly well-received by critics and fans, praising its top-tier visuals and atmosphere, while chastising the franchise's general sense of repetition even when bolstered by the power of the ninth generation of gaming. The campaign mode serves as both a reboot and a prequel to the original Modern Warfare canon, and sees Task Force 141 attempt to take down a global weapons cartel.\nCall of Duty Modern Warfare II is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.\nThe post Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 gets first free multiplayer trial today appeared first on Destructoid.",

In fact, a new update launched today, bringing with it a new stage, a new character skin, and several fun, festive accessories.\nFirst and foremost, \"The Man in Black\" skin is coming for DC anti-hero Black Adam, offering him the cinematic visage of Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson from the recent DCU movie — (which may, apparently, be part of the final hurrah for this incarnation of the troubled big screen series). Alongside Black Adam, a new stage has arrived, based on the sword-swinging series Game of Thrones. The new stage comes complete with a rendition of the show's theme, and finally gives launch character Arya Stark a place to call home.\nLookit her! What a cutie pie!\n\nGetting into the holiday spirit, MultiVersus has also launched a limited-time event known as \"FestiVersus\". For the coming weeks, players will be able to earn special cookies in battle, which can be exchanged for a variety of festive profile items and accessories, including avatars, stickers, and ring-out effects. Additionally, a selection of \"Ugly Sweaters\" will be available for some of the roster, ensuring that everyone is feeling the holiday spirit, whether they'd like to or not.\nThe new MultiVersus update launches today on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

Played with style and panache, this results in a dazzling spectacle of visual effects, played out against the backdrop of virtual skylines and starry nights. It's a simple but fast-paced endeavor, rewarding players with great music and cheerful visuals.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo1vJBQ97to&ab_channel=PlayStationJapan\nThe original Fantavision served as a launch title for PlayStation 2, as the use of color and effects made it a great showcase for the debuting hardware. It would seem that Fantavision 202X hopes to do the same for the incoming unit PSVR2, and, powered by Unreal technology and the might of the PS5 platform, one can only imagine how immersive and entertaining the new game will be when experienced in virtual reality. You just need a mug of hot chocolate and a giant coat and it's like you're right there.\nFantavision 202X will feature the same gameplay as its predecessors but will showcase fully dynamic 3D visuals, a replay mode, and the ability to pause and enjoy the action with a free-roaming camera. The trailer also appears to feature some way out new background settings, including a trip around planet Earth itself, as well as an anime-style space battle.\nFantavision 202X launches February 22, 2023 on PS5 and PSVR 2. Just remember, don't pick up a sparkler once you've dropped it.

The latest big update to the RPG was revealed today, adding the Paladin class, as well as some other tidbits leading up to the full launch.\nWith the addition of Patch 9, Paladin is now a class option in Baldur's Gate 3. The critically over-zealous knights bring a lot of power to the party. Alongside that are two subclass options, adhering to the Paladin's beliefs: the Oath of Devotion, and the Oath of the Ancients.\nBut if you just don't like following the rules, there is always the evil option. Go back on your oath, and you can become an Oathbreaker. Larian's Swen Vincke demonstrated this in today's panel, by breaking his player character's oaths and following in the path of an Oathbreaker Knight that visited his camp.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmi-QrT9br0\nMore features are in today's Patch 9 update too. There's a leval cap bump up to Level 5, the Fly spell has been added, the Reactions system has been revamped, and there's even a ping system. Personally, I'm a big fan of \"characters who attempt to play an instrument they're not Proficient with now fail spectacularly.\" Good update.\nA critical role\nThat's all for Baldur's Gate 3 now. But for Baldur's Gate 3 in the future, there is another update: voice actor Matthew Mercer is joining the cast. Mercer will voice Minsc, who popped up during last week's trailer at The Game Awards 2022.

The locomotive deckbuilder has been very well received, and it would've been easy to fall back into another one. And true enough, Shiny Shoe is making a roguelite again with Inkbound. But its tackling a different style combat, a fresh setting, and altogether interesting new challenge: a co-op rogue game.\nI recently got the chance to run through a chunk of Inkbound, both in solo play and in co-op with the developers at Shiny Shoe. Over the course of a couple hours, I got a decent look at some of what the team is planning, from a seasonal structure to how its thinking about co-op options.

          "description": "They run in a silky smooth 4K/60fps\nFinji Games has been a part of bringing us some of the best indie games of the past few years, including but not limited to Tunic, Chicory: A Colorful Tale, and I Was A Teenage Exocolonist. Now, Finji has just announced that two of their other popular indie titles, Overland and Night in the Woods, are natively available on the PlayStation 5. The real kicker, though, is that both of these games will run on the platform at a \"delicious\" 4K resolution at 60 frames per second, which is a big step up for smaller titles like these. What's more, those who already own these games on the PS4 will receive the new PS5 versions for free.\nhttps://twitter.com/FinjiCo/status/1602731322128187395\nIf you're looking for some nice new indies to play, or you simply enjoyed Overland or Night in the Woods and are looking to start another playthrough, it seems that now is the perfect time. These games don't have any issues running on weaker consoles or PCs, because the reality is that they're simply not all that demanding, but who can turn down the opportunity to play a game in 4K? It's one of those things that may not always be necessary, but it certainly is nice to have regardless.\nIt's cool to see huge games like The Witcher 3 get upgrades for the next gen, but I'm hoping that this move from Finji helps inspire other developers and publishers to make new ports for smaller games as well. Even years after its release, the PS5 library of games could still use some filling out, especially when it comes to indies. Plus, having the games look great and making them more readily available to a wider range of players might mean we see more people playing these indie darlings than before; there's nothing that pleases me more than seeing gamers get into indie games for the first time, because there really is so much amazing stuff out there.\nThe post Overland and Night in the Woods are now available natively on PS5 appeared first on Destructoid.",

In this case, we’re replaying one of the greatest games of the PS1 era, Silent Hill! Join us live on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central as we endure two hours of nostalgic, hair-raising scares. If you can’t catch us live, each episode will be available to watch on Saturdays on the Game Informer Shows YouTube channel. \nIn 1999, Konami put the fear of fog in a generation of players with the release of Silent Hill. The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that's (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later.\nWatch on Twitch!\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes. You’ll also be granted entry to the official Game Informer Discord channel, where our welcoming community members, moderators, and staff gather to talk games, entertainment, food, and organize hangouts!",

Now that he’s reached the top of the mountain, the series is giving the perpetually young hero his last hurrah before kicking off a fresh adventure starring a new cast of characters.\n\n\nThe Pokémon Company announced that beginning January 13 (in Japan), Ash and Pikachu’s final chapter begins. It consists of 11 special episodes serving as a grand send-off celebrating the duo's achievements. It also features some familiar faces from Ash’s past, including Misty and Brock.\nSometime later in the year, a new yet-to-be-titled animated series set in Scarlet/Violet’s Paldea region kicks offs. It stars two young trainers, Liko and Roy, joined by the three starters of that region: Sprigatito, Fuecoco, and Quaxly. The trailer also teases the appearance of a shiny Rayquaza.\nSo this is it. If you spent your childhood following Ash's exploits or have stuck with him for his entire run, how does it feel to finally see the character get his flowers and ride off into the sunset? Are you looking forward to finally seeing a series starring new heroes and storylines? Let us know in the comments!",

The game sees Toys for Bob, the studio behind Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time, step back into the developer role for the Crash Bandicoot series, but with a decidedly different approach in tow.\nCrash Team Rumble puts players in the shoes of Crash, Dingodile, and the Bandicoot's stable of friends and enemies. Each character has their own powers, personality, and playstyle as they duke it out in 4v4 competitions across a wide array of arenas. The teams compete in a variety of activities to bank the most Wumpa fruit in their drop-off zone while simultaneously defending it.\n\"We're so excited to unveil our fresh new take on multiplayer in the Crash universe with Crash Team Rumble,\" Paul Yan, co-studio head at Toys for Bob said in a press release. \"Crash Team Rumble has something for everyone – easy pick-up and play for those who just want to jump in, while also providing skilled gamers the opportunity to leverage and master their hero's unique abilities.\"\nYou can see the reveal trailer below.\n\n\nCrash Team Rumble comes to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in 2023.

While Dontnod is known best for its work on the Life is Strange series, Banishers is an action/RPG, and it might share more in common with the studio's 2018 game Vampyr. For a better look at the game, check out the teaser below.\n\n\nIn the reveal trailer, a man sits across the table from a woman, holding her hand. Another person in the room calls the man a banisher, one who hunts ghosts. Then, the woman at the table dissolves away into a blue light, indicating that she was a ghost the whole time. Afterward, we get a glimpse at what gameplay might look like, with the man and his ghostly companion leaping into battle with an undead creature called a bonewalker.\nOutside that brief trailer, we got a release window.

          "description": "Death Stranding 2 – the sequel to one of the best games of the previous console generation – was announced tonight during The Game Awards. As you might expect from director Hideo Kojima, it was baffling. \nThe trailer begins with Fragile, played by Lea Seydoux (No Time to Die, Crimes of the Future), running from some kind of threat while carrying a BB (a baby in an artificial womb; it's a whole thing) in tow. We then get a brief look at Sam Porter Bridges – the protagonist of the first game, played by Norman Reedus (The Walking Dead) – who Fragile tells, \"It's time for you to hit the road and start a new journey.\" Then everything truly goes off the rails. \nGiant mecha vehicles (not too unlike the titular Metal Gears from Kojima's previous series at Konami, Metal Gear Solid). Primary antagonist Higgs dressed like President Amelie Strand and playing an electric guitar. A BB pod full of tentacles. The ominous question, \"Should we have connected,\" casting doubts on the entire objective of the first game – connecting the United States – all quickly flashes onscreen. If it sounds like a lot, it is. Check it out for yourself below:\n\n\nWe're calling it Death Stranding 2, but from the looks of it, the game is actually named DS2. Also, aside from the previously mentioned movie stars, it features Elle Fanning (The Neon Demon) and Shioli Kutsuna (Deadpool 2). \nDuring a brief interview after the trailer, Kojima revealed he and his company, Kojima Productions, are also working on another video game project and other \"visual\" works.\nNo real release information was given, though the game is once again being published by Sony. The trailer also said the footage was captured on a PS5. So, it might be safe to assume Death Stranding 2, like Death Stranding before it, will have some window of exclusivity on Sony platforms. Guerilla Games will also be acting as a support studio, and its proprietary engine, Decima, will once again be used for the game.",

Conroy made his first appearance as Batman in 1992’s Batman: The Animated Series and has continued to play the character in countless shows, movies, and games. He portrayed Batman in the Arkham games, the series Rocksteady is best known for.\n\n\nUnlike the Arkham games, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is a co-op shooter. Harley Quinn, Captain Boomerang, King Shark, and Deadshot are on a mission to stop the Justice League after supervillain Brainiac corrupts them and forces them to wreak havoc on humanity. While it sounds like a bleak premise, this trailer also gives a good look at the dark humor the Suicide Squad is known for.\nRocksteady also announced that the game would be coming out on May 26, 2023, just a few months from now.

The actor is returning to play the beleaguered Jedi in the sequel, and he was around to follow up after the trailer to discuss his enthusiasm for the game. \nFor fans eagerly anticipating new details, the trailer offers a lot over which to muse.

Longtime Santa Monica Studios lead Eric Williams directed the sequel, which released last month. \nFortunately for all of us, though, Barlog was able to convince Judge that quitting was not the right call. Judge touched on this during his lengthy speech at The Game Awards 2022 after accepting the award for best performance in a video game.\n\n\nHere's what he said: \n\"I think it's kind of common knowledge that we were honored to go to Tribeca after 2018, and when Cory took me outside and said he wouldn't be directing the next one, I literally did quit. I quit. And he said, 'Nah, I vouch for Eric.' And I said, 'Eric Williams better be a beast.' Eric Williams is a motherf---ing beast.\"\nIt's unclear if Judge legitimately quit or if he was just using these words to express his initial disappointment that Barlog was not returning to direct Ragnarök. Nonetheless, Barlog vouched for Williams, and now we have Ragnarök, one of our highest-rated games of 2022 here at Game Informer.",

Hot on the heels of the wild success of Hades, Supergiant is doing something it’s never done before: crafting a sequel.\nAfter its previous work on titles like Bastion, Transistor, and Pyre, the studio’s new game takes us back to the roguelike playstyle of the original game, but with a new female lead fighting their way through hordes of enemies.\nInstead of Zagreus’ attempted escape from Hades, Hades 2 sees players attempting to descend to fight against the titan named Kronos. The character is dubbed the “Princess of the Underworld” but given the previous game’s nod to Greek mythology, there’s a good bet that this new character has some interesting ties to the big players in that well-known pantheon.\nBeyond the intriguing trailer, there’s no word on release date or console platform plans, but we do know to expect new details on Early Access in 2023, and that the game is coming to both Steam and Epic Game Store on PC.",

It's called Judas, and if you're a BioShock fan, you'll be happy with what you're about to see. \nTo say this title follows in BioShock's footsteps would be an understatement. From its industrial sci-fi look to its first-person dual-wielding, superpowered action, Judas sports the familiar trappings of Levine's work at Irrational Games. Ghost Story describes it as a single-player, narrative-driven shooter and provided this tantalizing synopsis:\n\"You are the mysterious and troubled Judas. Your only hope for survival is to make or break alliances with your worst enemies. Will you work together to fix what you broke – or will you leave it to burn?\"\n\n\nLevine formed Ghost Story games in 2014 after he closed Irrational, only taking on a small group of designers from the former studio. They've been working on its first title ever since, though whether that game has always been Judas remains to be seen. After years of mostly silence, many wondered if we'd see anything come out of the studio; it was reported earlier this year that the team's first project had gone through a rocky patch. Thus, it's nice to see the fruits of their labor finally.\nJudas doesn't have a release window, but it's coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

For the full list of characters coming to the base game, head here.\nThe new trailer showed off the World Tour mode, which lets you customize your avatar and travel the world to locations like the US, France, and more.

Evath's moon Mitral has turned into a gigantic gas time bomb. A meteor is also due to impact Mitral in the next several hours. You were chosen to secure each of Mitral's 18 sectors by positioning a drilling rig over the gas pockets in each sector before the meteor strikes.\nSolve challenging riddles by relying on geological clues, intuition, or good old trial and error. To survive your mission, find Rubicon crystals to restore energy and destroy (or avoid) the Laser Beacons and Skanners left behind by the Ketars. Good luck!\nOur reimplemented engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Driller support is limited to DOS (EGA mode), Amiga and AtariST releases, but we hope to be able to add more soon! Please contact us if you have some other release.\nTo play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build.

Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. A new Generate World menu which now includes NewGRF, AI, and Game Script configuration menus.

The ability to clone or share orders with vehicles grouped by shared orders. An improved local authority action window which now shows you actions you can’t afford, instead of hiding them. In addition, some new tools are available to AI and Game Script authors: Scriptable league tables which can replace the default scoring system AI and Game Scripts can now be modified in Scenario Editor for existing scenarios (although not savegames) (As ever, see the changelog for further details).
