          "description": "He better watch out.\nBack in 2014, a team of new developers calling themselves GalaxyTrail released Freedom Planet—a retro style platformer that captured the hearts of many classic-era Sonic the Hedgehog fans. Freedom Planet, in fact, started life as a Sonic fan game, though it established a unique identity for itself as development wore on, and sales were fortunately high enough that the team was able to greenlight the development of a sequel. Now, ten years on, Freedom Planet 2 has finally arrived for consoles, and we’re pleased to report that it is everything you'd hope for from a sequel. The level designs are tighter, the gameplay is more exciting, the graphics have gotten a nice boost; this is all around a much more confident and enthralling release.\nThe story picks up at the same time as the ending of the first game, with the climactic events of that finale causing an ancient Water Dragon named Merga to be released from a magical prison. The plot then jumps forward three years, following original protagonists Lilac, Carol, and Milla as they work to clean up the few robot stragglers left over from the events of the first game. The trio is then recruited by Neera, the new playable protagonist, for a meeting with the Magister, who asks them for help in getting to the bottom of who has been causing the recent robot attacks. Naturally, the ancient threat they unknowingly released has something to do with it, kicking off a lengthy journey to reveal this new villain’s motives and ultimately foil their plans.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Earlier today Tom Betts - founder of Nullpointer and former lead programmer at The Signal From Tolva developers Big Robot - emailed me about his new game The Horror At Highrook. In the space of a single, rollercoaster paragraph, Betts earned my curiosity by describing himself as a fellow Soul Reaver enthusiast, lost it again by criticising Soul Reaver’s camera - such insolence! - and earned it swiftly back by mentioning that he’s from Yorkshire. Then, he upgraded my curiosity into attention by describing The Horror At Highrook as a “clockwork narrative” horror experience that takes inspiration from Poe, Stoker and Lovecraft on the one hand, and from boardgames, wiki-hunting and escape rooms on the other.\nThis is a heady brew indeed. Also, there appears to be a cat in the game called Mr Tubbs, described as a “portly grey barrel of fur”. I entertain suspicions of Mr Tubbs. What fell secrets lurk behind his perfectly groomed exterior? Anyway, here’s the trailer.\n Read more",

Published by Totally Accurate Battle Simulator outfit Landfall, it's sort of like Lethal Company in being about venturing into horrible places as a wibbly-wobbly defenceless explorer, but rather than gathering scrap for resale, you're filming yourself and the monsters in a bid to publish a viral \"SpookTube\" video, with tuber celebrity translating into cash for new equipment. \nEach video is edited together automatically from your footage and accompanying voicechat, once you return from each trip to the Old World, and you can watch it all on an in-game monitor with a mocked-up chat feed and viewcount. It's a pungent, potted commentary on the machinations of Youtube celebrity, with heady notes of \"cautionary tale about algorithmic content generation\" and \"cautionary tale about people endangering or hurting themselves being a dependable source of views\".

Launched back in 2014 after seven years in development, ESO's hybrid of deceptively single-player-ish Elder Scrolls presentation with MMO fixtures attracted a lukewarm response, initially. “At its best The Elder Scrolls Online looks like a faithful addition to the lore,” intoned Brendy in our own launch impressions. “At its worst it is a derivative and uninventive anachronism.”\nZeniMax Online have made big strides with the game over the years, however - binning off monthly subscriptions and introducing a “level-free” format in the One Tamriel update in 2016. ESO has also swelled and sprouted steadily as a work of geography and history, with major chapters introducing areas hitherto only mentioned in dusty collectible tomes, or creatively reintroducing locations from the single player series – the forthcoming Gold Road expansion, out in June 2024, takes us to the West Weald in Cyrodiil, an area last seen in The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Like an aggressively competitive thane at a reindeer-piss guzzling contest, 2D tac-and-slash roguelite Sons Of Valhalla never lets up the pace for even a moment. Whether you’re charging across its pixel-art battlefields slashing and burning increasingly tough-to-crack strongholds, or making quick decisions to get the upper hand in its tug-of-war tactics, the only times Thorald is not doing cool violence, commanding others to do cool violence, or upgrading his camps so that he may act in cooler and more violent ways, is when he’s restoring stamina with a cool slug of mead or violently gnawing at health-boosting meat.\nViking Thorald Olavson is a man possessed. A rival Jarl burnt his village and nicked his wife Raya. In his quest to find her, he’s prepared to do anything - even visit England. As Thorald, you’ll butcher your way up a chain of command in your search for Raya across six stages, each of which sits somewhere between the side-scrolling tactics of Kingdom Two Crowns, the lane strategy of a Warpips, and the slashy/blocky/shooty/dodgy of any 2D ARPG you care to name.\n \nRead more",

          "description": "So, how was everyone’s long weekend? I don’t want to alarm anyone, but I think I may have even sensed the fading ghost of an immeasurably whisper-thin ray of sunshine at one point. Enough! Says a new patch for co-op shooter Helldivers 2. You know who else enjoys basking in the pleasant glow of mildly enjoyable weather when there’s freedoms that need fighting for? Bug sympathisers, that’s who. As such, the developers have gone and added new planetary hazards in the form of blizzards and sandstorms, alongside the usual balance tweaks.\nAlongside these reminders that the war for democracy is never comfortable, the efficiently-named Patch 01.000.200 also includes a host of tweaks. Notable among these are balancing changes to the mission type ‘Retrieve Essential Personnel’, which now sounds more manageable. Enemy spawn points have been placed further away from the objective, “to give players a fairer chance of defending the location.” Additionally, fewer civilians are needed to beat the mission on higher difficulties.\n \nRead more",

Probably because the first weapon you get is a frying pan, which you then use to batter horrible chicken-leg aliens.

Soon static monsters appear in their own isolated windows you'll have to shoot your way towards (their attacks can cross the void between), and before long there are the horrible hateful little blue bastards who sit there passively, soaking up shots and never attacking but actively pulling the edges of the window towards them.\nIt's a clever and great little thing and I sort of hate it as much as I like it.\nRead more",

          "description": "So, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, eh? I liked it a lot. 150 hours a lot. I big cried at least twice and welled up, much like a well, many other times. As much as I’d like to wax emotional about the plot and characters in an endless lifestream-of-consciousness ramble, articles need both headlines and subjects (truly an act of conspiratorial violence targeted at my personal dadaist instincts). So, let’s talk about just the minigames, because I think they’re wonderful for all sort of reasons that might not be immediately apparent.  Naturally, big spoiler potential ahead if, like me, you consider everything you haven’t experienced in the RPG game a spoiler.\nI think one of OG Final Fantasy’s 7 best tricks is how it doesn’t just dish out its strangest distractions as a palette cleanser to the main meal of its action and drama, but actively works them in as an indispensable part of the menu. It also does this all without a shred of shame or self-consciousness, resulting in a cinematic video game with no inner turmoil or resentment toward either part of that equation - a characteristic I feel is suffered from by many of the games for which FF7 lead the way. Take the Gold Saucer. It’s an excuse to dick around and ride motorbikes, sure, but it’s also an essential story beat while the party takes time to relax and enjoy each other’s company away from the stress of travel and battle.\n \nRead more",

This feels doubly important when the game itself is so fleeting in length, its brief and dizzying journey through the dirt, magma, ice and marshy bogs of this strange, treasure-stuffed island coming to a swift conclusion in just over three and a half hours. It left me wanting more the moment the credits rolled, but deep down I know it's also perfectly formed just the way it is.

Plus a straw poll indicates that only one of us would enjoy be at the middle of a maelstrom of chaos and being the Helldivers GM as a job. Bet you can absolutely guess which one of us it was.\r\n\n \nRead more",

We've had a couple of successful outings over the years with the likes of Death's Door and Hollow Knight and company, but anything with pure FromSoft blood running through its veins has always left me cold. Void Sols, however, is an upcoming Soulslike that feels like it might be able to satisfy both sides of the 'git gud' camp, appealing to nervous dodge-rollers like myself while also giving hardened Elden Ringers a run for their money. It's all down to its plentiful supply of approachable customisation options, allowing you to ratchet up the difficulty if you're finding things a bit easy, or knock it down, reapply your stat points, and even create whole new loadouts - each with their own individual stat combinations - to win the day. It's all wonderfully considerate, and having played the free demo that's just launched on Steam, I'd strongly recommend giving it a go if you're feeling in need of a little training ahead of Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree coming out.\nRead more",

Darktide is hard when you start a new character, with weapons that barely scratch some foes and no talents to back them up. It's a challenge unlike the official high difficulty levels, which lean towards drowning you in special enemies. So after hitting level 30 on all four classes and grinding out great gear, I've started a new character who'll never learn skills or get a good gun. She's quite bad, and that's quite fun.\nRead more",

After the recent 1.6 mega-update to the game, which added a whole bunch of stuff, Barone (better known in his developer form as ConcernedApe) Xeeted out a list of fixes in the now-available 1.6.3 update. This makes tweaks to things arising from 1.6 (many of them addressing moss, a new foraging item) and fixes bugs, one of which was causing 'excess trash' to be fished.\nImportantly, 1.6 added more pet animals to the game, and the mini-update has built in a case where if you don't have a pet by year two, for any reason, then you can adopt them from Marnie's.

Now, Hellgate's original creator Bill Roper has announced he's working on a brand new Hellgate game under his new studio Lunacy Games.\nRead more",

Horizon Forbidden West: Complete Edition succeeds where Dragon’s Dogma 2 spluttered, quietly yet capably adapting to handheld hardware. Keeping performance up requires a fair bit of fine-tuning the graphics settings, and a girthsome install size might trouble the internal drives of smaller models, but otherwise, Forbidden West is just as portable-friendly as Horizon Zero Dawn.

The mystery is really just a backdrop, though - a device to better bring forth the themes of family and secrets. Most specifically it's about mother-daughter relationships, as we join single mum Opal and her sixteen-year-old daughter Tess on a short (from our point of view) but bittersweet road trip when, going through Opal's mother's home post-funeral, they discover she may have had an affair decades before. Can you ever really know the people you love? Does it matter? If you left your daughter's early-00s flip phone back at the motel, would you turn around and lose four hours, or hope it's still there on the way back?\nRead more",

Survival MMO Dune: Awakening threatens to bring that back in a big way: the novel and films on which it’s based take place, after all, on an entire planet made of sand. \r\n\n\r\nDevelopers Funcom have various plans for sprucing up the aesthetic, however. For one thing, parts of Awakening are set underground, where there’s actual, canonical vegetation and thus, a wider range of colours. For another, it’s possible Dune: Awakening will ultimately leave the dunes behind and whisk us away on a journey to another planet.\r\n \nRead more",

Geneforge 2 - Infestation is fresh from the rack, yet looks and functions like the CRPGs of the late 1990s. Where most isometric throwbacks these days offer a forced perspective over 3D scenes, Geneforge 2 is the real deal - its flat character sprites gliding across tiled backgrounds, with the elegant shuffle of Shōgun-era ladies-in-waiting.\nThis look is less a nostalgic affectation than it is simply practical. Geneforge 2, like all of Jeff Vogel’s games, was made in the spare bedroom of his Seattle home with the help of his wife, Mariann Krizsan - plus a handful of artists spread more broadly. It’s the latest in a long line of low-budget Spiderweb Software RPGs to achieve sprawling scale and reactivity by leaning on cost-effective and old-fashioned production values. Here there is no voice acting, nor any ambient noise that cannot be sourced from royalty-free soundbanks. In pastoral areas of the map, the impression of grazing livestock is conveyed entirely through a free sound effect called ‘Eating a rusk.wav’.\nRead more",

What does it take to survive as a survival sim, in these days when every other game seems to be a survival sim? What separates the fit from the extinct?

Gaia, said AI, has been turned off and split into different parts, so yours and Aloy's job sequel is to, firstly, reboot Gaia, and secondly collect all these subordinate functions.

The hosts played the game for 5 hours at Ghost Story Games in Boston, then interviewed director Ken Levine. Here’s a crunchy chipstick of a take to kick things off with; Judas is, says Ralph of SkillUp, “Definitely not Bioshock in space”. I...haven't played it, have I, so I'll put my cynicism in its horrible little cage for a bit. Aesthetically, at least, Judas does look to have a lot going for it.\nNot least because of the giant robot dog that takes on the role of Bioshock’s bathysphere this time around. Riding the dog sounds to involve a pixel art minigame that has you collect fuel pickups. You’ll ride the dog between the “districts” of the city-sized spaceship Mayflower. We also got a few details on what exactly those districts might entail. The hosts mention a  “birthing district” and “milk district”. Whatever you think the “milk district” might be in terms of a Bioshock-ian dystopia, it sounds like you’re probably right. The hosts made a face. I made a face. I’m sure you are also likely making a face right now. \n \nRead more",

          "description": "I find myself increasingly turned off these days by simulations that boast of endless butterfly effects. I guess my misgivings can be boiled down to \"a chain of dominoes is still a chain of dominoes even if it's 1000 metres in extent\". Without some reason to care supplied by a narrative or broader question of theming and aesthetics, it all risks being admirable of execution but also like sheer technical maximalism - systems for the sake of systems. What do I care if I can make the 567th domino fall over by kicking the first?\r\n\n\r\nStill, I'm very interested to see more of City 20. In development since 2018, it's the work of Untold Games, a studio hitherto known for VR projects, location-based \"immersive experiences\" and ports of games such as Journey To The Savage Planet. As a piece of mechanics, it's a top-down sandbox survival experience with a highly reactive environment and procedural storytelling, influenced by the likes of Rimworld (and not, the developers insist, created using latter-day generative AI tools). As a story scenario, meanwhile, it's inspired by Cold War conspiracy theories about Soviet \"secret cities\" given over to uranium enrichment and nuclear experiments. The titular City 20 is one such burg, though not a direct recreation. As the game begins, a nuclear accident has led to a radiation spike and a partial evacuation: you play one of the poor suckers who didn't make the last bus out of town.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Good news for people who don’t cringe violently every time they encounter the phrase “Narrative Legos”! We’ve finally got some more details about the extremely Bioshock-adjacent Judas, courtesy of the Ian Games Network, who spent six hours playing the game and chatting to Levine at Ghost Story Games in Boston. It’s a massive interview, but very broadly, it's an FPS game that gives you guns in your right hand and “various organic powers” in your left. It’s got a big focus on story and choosing your own path through character interaction, and it also has roguelike elements. “The ship is different every time you die and come back, the ship layout can be different,\" says Levine. \r\n\n\r\nJudas, it turns out, is the name of the woman you’ve likely already seen in the trailers, who is also your player character. The game takes place aboard the Mayflower, a spaceship the size of a city doing that thing from Hitchhiker’s Guide with the hairdressers, only the Earth seems to have been in actual danger this time. You start the game being resurrected, or “reprinted”. You’ll then start chatting to holographic projections of the three leaders of the ship; all of which have different goals, roles, and Bioshock-ian quirks. They’re at odds with each other, and you’ll get to decide who to work with and against, hence “Narrative Legos” and “No two playthroughs ever…” yadayada, which is a phrase that seems almost quaint in terms of comparative obnoxiousness. \r\n\n\n Read more",

Imagine my glee, then, when an early quest in action RPG Dragon's Dogma 2 not only condoned my weird hobby, but actively encouraged it.\nAlfred is bardic beggar you’ll likely first encounter by Vernworth’s city square water feature. He’s doing a spot of medieval busking, spinning some brilliantly localized rhyming yarns to whoever will listen. He also periodically asks for beer money, even if you think he’s shit, which is a great pitch. Onlookers come and go, but after listening to him gas up the nobility with tall tales for a spell, you’ll likely spot a particularly enthusiastic permanent fixture off to the side. Have a chat, and he’ll tell you he reckons there’s something fishy about Alfred. He never sees much patronage from busking, but he never seems short of coin. Follow him around for a bit and see how he makes his money, won’t you? My annoyance that I’d just given Alfred several hundred gold immediately dissipated at the prospect of some quest journal-sanctioned stalking.\n \nRead more",

You do have to look for it, mind you. The game's art direction at large is an elegant hodgepodge of inspirations that deserves to be unpicked carefully after release.\nMain character Nor Vanek - who is on a mission to massacre various escaped underworld gods - is kind of a Napoleonic superhero. Rakishly attired in braided frock coats and knee-high boots, she can use sparking \"blackpowder\" pistols both to inflict damage and to double-jump or dodge while performing snappily choreographed, one-handed sword and axe combos, straight out of God of War. As regards locations, there are pale medieval citadels with stained-glass windows, coffee shops run by eerie, many-armed \"Hosts\" that glean from the ambience of Turkish bazaars, and certain other fantastical areas and characters - including Nor's spectral fox sidekick Enki - that are influenced by ancient Mesopotamian mythology. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Maintaining the thrum of a finely-tuned citybuilder has to be one of the most satisfying acts of video game plate-spinning around. Nursing that constant flow of foot traffic, produce and profits, all of them teetering on a carefully honed knife-edge, that's the good stuff right there. Of course, it's not always the threat of imminent and total collapse that fuels these mighty engines of urban planning. Sometimes it's the simple pleasure of building itself, watching a scrub of dirt track rise up into an advanced superhighway of architectural wonder. The best of these more relaxed kinds of citybuilders - your Dorfromantiks and your SteamWorld Builds et al - still involve plenty of plate-spinning; it's just that they won't ever fall over if you take your eye off the ball for a moment.\nBulwark: Falconeer Chronicles sits at the citybuilding crossroads of 'relaxed' and 'something more'. It wants to be an easy-going kind of builder, as nothing fundamentally bad happens when the wheels stop turning for a moment. For the most part, you're free to build where and however you please, constructing imposing fortresses jutting out into the ocean from mere scraps of rock. But it also gets more bogged down in the minutiae of resource flow, worker management and conquest and expansion via muddy, ill-defined combat procedures than it probably should. It always feels on the precipice of becoming something bigger, bolder and more boisterous than it ever really achieves, dipping its toes into the murky waters of its lonely Ursee without truly ever getting its feet wet.\nRead more",

We're here to show you how to fix the MW3 and Warzone black screen issue, including details on updates.\n\n\nWarzone and MW3 black screen solution\n\n\nAccording to COD Updates, you can fix the MW3 and Warzone black screen problem by restarting the game. This will provide a new update that fixes the issue. The problem links to a Season 3 server error, but fortunately, it should now be up and running with the latest patch. That means players don't need to go through the hassle of uninstalling and installing it again to get things back in motion. \n\n\nIf the error persists, some Battle.net players suggest changing your region to fix the Call of Duty black screen. Once the area has been adjusted, launch the game and return it to your previous destination. Sometimes, the settings just need a little refresher to get rid of the bug. \n\n\nThe MW3 and Warzone black screen issue appears across multiple devices, including PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. Similar to past Call of Duty launches, new seasons tend to bring out errors like this due to the large number of player counts. During this time, it's best to check for any new updates, as there have been several new patches after Season 3's launch. \n\n\nCheck out the MW3 or Warzone Trello boards to keep track of any errors. Other known problems are present here, such as the Call of Duty not updating bug for Season 3. More fixes will likely arrive sooner rather than later now that the CoD team is aware of the various issues. \n\nThe post How to fix black screen in Call of Duty Warzone and MW3 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Indie game developer Steelkrill Studio, best known for its psychological horror titles with a unique art style, has announced a new anomaly game titled The Stairway 7. In The Stairway 7, players are stuck in a creepy looping stairway with a cat. It's up to players to spot the differences as they ascend the stairway or else risk getting trapped.\n\n\nSteelkrill certainly knows how to do psychological horror, responsible for the development of found footage survival horror game The Backrooms 1998 and World War 1 horror survival game Trenches. Earlier this year it also released the cosmic horror game Rotten Flesh where you descend into a dark sewer system in search of your dog Roy while calling for him using your microphone. All of Steelkrill's titles use a similar washed-out art style that really adds to the horror element, and it seems The Stairway 7 will as well.\n\n\nIt's hard not to draw comparisons to The Exit 8, but seeing Steelkrill's unique art style and charm mixed with this type of gameplay really has me excited. According to the Steam page for The Stairway 7, some anomalies will simply try to trick you while others will try to actually hurt and kill you. The further up the stairway you go, the deeper into the madness of the anomalies you go as well, causing more twisted and perilous environments.\n\n\nWhile there is no specific release date just yet, Steelkrill plans to release The Stairway 7 next month on Steam.\n\nThe post Horror developer Steelkrill announces new anomaly title The Stairway 7 appeared first on Destructoid.",

It looks to be my kind of weird.\n\n\nGreat God Grove casts you as “the Gods’ new mail-carrier,” embuing you with the power to suck up dialogue boxes, which you then deliver to solve puzzles. Apparently, the gods aren’t around to avoid total annihilation, so it’s up to you to prevent “A-POCKY-LIPS.” That’s a lot of pressure for someone on a mail carrier’s salary.\n\n\n\n\nThe trailer released with the announcement shows off the same whimsical art style that helped make Smile for Me so memorable. Including puppets! One of my favorite moments is when the player character sucks up a dialogue box that says, “I’m HAM-HOT for a handsome god!” (aren’t we all?) which is then flung right into the face of a flattered god.\n\n\nA more optimistic Zoey spoke of Smile for Me back in 2021 and found it to be a much-needed non-violent joy-maker in the vein of Chulip or Moon. You might say I was HAM-HOT for it. I also spoke a little bit with the devs, who seem pretty cool. Great times! If you haven’t tried Smile for Me, it was released last year on Switch, Xbox, and PlayStation platforms.\n\n\nGreat God Grove has a vague release window of “2024” and will be coming to PC.\n\nThe post Great God Grove looks to be a suck-tacular adventure from the devs behind Smile For Me appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Paper is one of those items in Infinite Craft that acts as a catalyst for many interesting new recipes on your endless, wordsmithing journey. If you’re looking for how to start paper crafting in Infinite Craft, here's how to make the word Paper in a few simple steps. \n\n\nHow to get Paper in Infinite Craft\n\n\nThe process to get Paper is quite simple. It can be achieved with the simple elements with some easy-to-follow combinations they make. Here’s the sequence of combinations for creating Paper: \n\n\n\nWater + Earth = Plant\n\n\nPlant + Plant = Tree\n\n\nTree + Water = River\n\n\nRiver + Tree = Paper\n\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nCombinations to use with Paper\n\n\nSince Paper is such a plain word in this game, it also acts as a versatile crafting component to get into the more literary, entertainment, and political side of things. For example, here are some combinations we used to get you started:\n\n\n\nPaper + Paper = Book\n\n\nPaper + Book = Library\n\n\nPaper + Japan = Origami\n\n\nPaper + Love = Valentine\n\n\nPaper + Trump = Fake News\n\n\nPaper + Alien = Flying Saucer\n\n\nPaper + Time = History\n\n\nPaper + Thunderbolt = Zeus\n\n\n\nThese are only just a small handful of combinations you can get with Paper. The byproducts of it can be taken even further. For example, let’s use Book as the base:\n\n\n\nBook + Iron = Steel\n\n\nBook + Pikachu = Pokedex\n\n\nBook + Snake = Bible\n\n\nBook + Japan = Manga\n\n\nBook + Romeo X Juliet = Shakespeare\n\n\n\nWith how far we have come along since the beginning of Infinite Craft, it has become significantly more difficult to get a First Discovery. However, with how many wild combinations you can get, and with important crafting items like Paper, there are still many more to be found.\n\nThe post How to make Paper in Infinite Craft appeared first on Destructoid.",

Cyberpunk used to be the pessimistic vision of the future, showing one of the worst-case scenarios for human advancement.

Unfortunately, many players have encountered an issue that has forbidden them from accessing the newest content. So, if you are currently having problems with the network, here's how to fix the Call of Duty not updating issue. \n\n\nCall of Duty not updating solution\n\n\nMW3 and Warzone Season 3 update loads have been running relatively slowly for many users. More specifically, full downloads for Battle.net players are not working. To fix the Call of Duty not updating issue, use the following techniques:\n\n\n\nRestart game\n\n\nEnsure that your internet connection is stable\n\n\nCheck the Call of Duty servers on DownDetector or Activision\n\n\nWait until the servers clear up or a new update arrives\n\n\n\nI ran to the Call of Duty not updating problem, presenting an almost endless loop of a 'Check for updates\" load. However, once I restarted the game, the patch was finally installed after a few attempts. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nIf you've initiated the usual steps of checking your internet connection, you may need to wait it out while the servers clear up. New seasons always seem to cause laggy performances and error codes, especially with the MW3 and Warzone Season 3 release. Currently, Activision Online Services indicate that Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone are experiencing outages with the network.  \n\n\nOn the bright side, the Call of Duty Updates Twitter/X account created a Trello card for the Call of Duty not updating PC issues.

In that time, players have figured out ways to emulate the game on PC, but this will be an official release. Along with improved visuals, the game will also support mouse and keyboard as well as keybinds (unfortunately \"there is no controller support at this time\"). Longtime players will also be able to bring all their progress over by linking their mobile account to their EA account when playing on PC for the first time, and all future updates will release on both mobile and PC platforms simultaneously. The teams says, \"The PC and mobile version will always be in lockstep and release updates at the same time.\"\nBeta access for the PC version will be available for current mobile players in May before expanding to a larger audience. From the developer: \"For those interested, they can head to the Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes website, sign up for the EA App, link their account, and they are now ready to register.

Perhaps that's why InKonbini's reveal trailer has me so excited to play this team's first game; but the game itself looks great, too. \nYou play as college student Makoto Hayakawa who is taking a break from her studies…",

He revealed this during a recent interview with IGN, where he also confirmed Saber took Star Wars: KOTOR Remake with it following its split from Embracer Group. \nLast month, Embracer Group, the company behind the closure of Saints Row studio Volition Games and layoffs at companies like Black Forest Games and Eidos-Montréal, sold Saber in a $500 million deal. It sold the studio, which is also developing the first-person adventure Jurassic Park: Survival, to a group of private investors under Beacon Interactive, which is controlled by Karch. At the time of the sale, the company didn't mention its Star Wars: KOTOR Remake, leaving excited fans concerned for the game, which itself has already gone through some rocky development. \n\n\nNow, thanks to Karch's interview with IGN, we know the game is still in development. \n\"It's clear and it's obvious that we're working on this,\" Karch told the publication. \"It's been in the press numerous times. What I will say is that the game is alive and well, and we're dedicated to making sure we exceed consumer expectations.\" \nThat's all Karch shared about the remake, however, and IGN writes that in an investor call following the announcement of Saber's sale, Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors implied the remake might still be a long ways away. \nFor more about the game, watch the Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake reveal trailer, and then read about how Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic's biggest issue is how it plays. After that, check out Game Informer's big list of upcoming video game remakes. \n[Source: IGN]\nAre you still excited for Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake?

Oxcarts are the easiest, most affordable option, but they're only available in certain cities, and each route only has one of two destinations. They're also prone to attacks. In one extreme case, I got off the cart to slay some goblins, turned around to get back on the cart, and saw it get absolutely decimated by a griffin attack, leaving me stranded in the middle of nowhere.

Hours after the sale, some Gearbox employees announced on social media that they had been let go from the company. Today, Gearbox has confirmed these departures.\nIn a statement to Eurogamer, Gearbox states that an unknown number of employees have been let go but that those affected are not tied to the development of upcoming games. Gearbox stated last week that it has six titles in the works, including a new Borderlands game. \n\"As we strive towards our mission to entertain the world, we are grateful that our talent and capability are of interest to you and your audience,\" says Gearbox as part of its statement. \"The Embracer Group will continue to report on their restructuring program that impacted some parts of Gearbox today that are not tied to the development of Gearbox Software games.\"\nWhile Gearbox has not divulged the number of staff members let go, several employees took to social media soon after the announcement of the sale to announce their departures. Among them, Gearbox PR manager Jennifer Locke stated on X that she and “countless others” had been affected, as surfaced by Eurogamer.  \nEmbracer sold Gearbox (after acquiring it for 1.3 billion in 2021) as part of an ongoing effort to reduce costs after betting on a $2 billion deal with Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group that ultimately fell through last year. Embracer has spent the last few months either selling off its studios, shutting them down, or laying off employees as part of a massive restructuring process to recoup losses from this failed deal. \n[Source: Eurogamer]",

These debates are often full of superfluous apples-to-oranges comparisons and, as a result, are unlikely to come up with a definitive answer everyone will be happy with. But that's what makes them so fun. In that spirit, we took the month of March to hold our own bracket-style tournament, voted on by readers, to determine the greatest video game of all time.\nThough we here at Game Informer assembled the bracket, even that was heavily influenced by our Reader Vote we held in 2018 to coincide with our 300th issue.

          "description": "After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.\nJoin Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

          "description": "Red Candle Games made its name developing psychological horror titles such as Detention and Devotion, but its third game, Nine Sols, sees the studio veer into the action genre. First revealed in 2021, the Sekiro-inspired title is coming on May 29.\nNine Sols sports a hand-drawn art direction and an aesthetic that blends sci-fi, cyberpunk, Eastern mythology (the legend of Hou Yi in particular), and Taoism. Players control a cat-like warrior named Yi, who is awakened after years of slumber in New Kunlun, a city for humans created by nine god-like rulers. New Kunlun may appear to be a utopia, but a secret surrounds it as Yi embarks on a vengeful quest to take down all nine rulers. \n\n\nThe 2D Metroidvania features fast-paced combat and a parry system directly inspired by Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. In addition to a sword, Yi is armed with a divine bow and uses Taoist talismans to make enemies explode. A sprawling, interconnected map features numerous NPCs to assist, secrets, and challenging boss battles. \nNine Sols is coming to PC via Steam (it also has a demo). You can learn more about Nine Sols’ creation and the history of Red Candle Games by reading our studio profile.",

After quietly working on its first project, the team is ready to show the world what it’s been cooking up.\nThe studio released a brief teaser of their yet-to-be-titled first game. A press release states that this mysterious project is a fantasy action-adventure title targeting a 2025 release. We won’t find out more until April 2, when IGN will reveal the game as an IGN First. \n\n\nThe studio also included two pieces of concept art, which you can view in the gallery below.\n\nYellow Brick Games was founded by Thomas Giroux (co-founder/CEO), Jeff Skalski (co-founder/COO), Frédéric St-Laurent B (game director), and Mike Laidlaw (chief creative officer). The team has offices in both Montreal and Quebec City and currently consists of 68 employees. The studio was founded to foster a \"people first\" work culture where employees' wellness takes priority while also focusing on developing titles featuring, according to their website, \"deeply interactive spaces where player creativity can shine.\"\n\"We are thrilled to share this exciting news with our community. Self-publishing is a leap of faith, especially in the current turbulent industry climate, but it’s also an opportunity to take our destiny into our own hands and reach out directly to players and the wider gaming community during this release.” says Mike Laidlaw, in a press release\"Our team has been hard at work for years, and we can’t wait to showcase our debut project to the world. It’s a huge milestone for us, and we see it as just the first step on what we hope will be a long and rewarding journey for the company, charting our own path, and growing our talents and products brick by brick.”",

It wasn’t until 2021, however, that we got our first proper look at Stellar Blade during a PlayStation showcase, where it was shown with its former title, Project Eve.\nFor those not paying close attention to Korean video game news, it felt like it came out of nowhere. In the trailer, a beautiful woman is seen fighting a hybrid monster robot. She uses a sword to break off one of the cyborg creature’s arms to use as a weapon before being thrown through a wall, revealing the fight was happening on a space station all along. As she careens through space further and further away from the station, it is revealed that a much …",

          "description": "If you've been paying attention to our Game Gauntlet, a bracket where our readers decide the best game of all time, you might have noticed one contender has been an unstoppable force – The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. It nuked Fallout 3, omnislashed Final Fantasy VII, felled Elden Ring (without using spirit ashes), and survived the hordes of The Last of Us. Skyrim was a groundbreaking open-world adventure when it was first released, and fans clearly have plenty of love for it in the 13 years since then and now, so it's no surprise the gaming community has been clamoring for news about a sequel for years now. Luckily, we do have a minor update for fans who need something to tide them over just a little longer.\nThirty years ago, The Elder Scrolls series began with The Elder Scrolls: Arena, so Bethesda put together a little celebratory post touring through each game in the franchise. The post, which you can read in its entirety below, ends with a small section about the highly anticipated next entry.\nThe relevant section says, \"Last but not least, yes, we are in development on the next chapter – The Elder Scrolls VI. Even now, returning to Tamriel and playing early builds has us filled with the same joy, excitement, and promise of adventure.\"\nThere's really not much to go on, but as Kotaku points out, this does confirm that the series will stay on the continent of Tamriel rather than venturing off to other areas in the fantasy world, along with the fact that the game is at least in a playable state. That said, there's no telling how far off from release it still is; the last we heard was from Microsoft's private documents that were leaked during its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which put the release date somewhere 2026 or later.\nFor more Bethesda, check out the news about The Elder Scrolls' newest spin-off,  read our Starfield review, and see which Xbox games are coming to other platforms.",

As a result, it might not be able to maintain its current team size; 46 out of 121 employees were given notice they may be laid off in the next 60 days. \n“This is a rough environment for a lot of indie studios, and like them, we are faced with some very hard choices,” Velan writes in the post.

The game earned rave reviews from most critics, including a 9 out of 10 from us. But now that it’s out in the wild, Steam players have bombarded the RPG with negative reviews due to its problematic launch performance and day-one microtransactions.\nIn terms of performance problems, Steam players have reported issues such as framerate drops, freezes, and crashes. Capcom has acknowledged these issues in a Steam blog post where it says, “To all those looking forward to this game, we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience,” and adds, “We are investigating/fixing critical problems such as crashes and freezing.

The new story content opens the door to an entirely new area to explore in Valisthea, but the big draw is the appearance of the Eikon Leviathan. \nBack in December, Final Fantasy XVI players were treated to the Echoes of the Fallen expansion, which took Clive and his companions to a long-abandoned tower created by the Fallen precursor civilization. The Rising Tide will further expand on the game's story, but in a new direction, focusing on Leviathan. In the new story sequence, a letter arrives to the hideaway with a request for help from the Dominant of that long-lost Eikon of Water, and the party must set out to face a new threat. We detailed some of what we learned in a preview earlier this month. \nThe new trailer puts a big focus on combat sequences, giving us a good look at several fights, including Clive acting as Ifrit to battle against Leviathan as they each coast over a massive body of water. The new sights and characters offer a convincing reason to redownload that massive RPG and take Clive for one more big adventure. \n\n\n\nAre you planning to jump back into Final Fantasy XVI for this Leviathan-themed DLC? Let us know in the comments below.",

          "description": "Grasshopper Manufacture announced during its summer showcase last year that its 2011 supernatural action game Shadows of the Damned is getting an encore in the form of a remaster. We now know the title of that update, along with a release window.\nThe newly christened Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered is coming later this year. Unfortunately, the game’s website and Steam page don’t detail exactly how the game has been enhanced from a performance standpoint. Grasshopper did release screenshots, so you’ll have to use those to discern the difference between this re-release and the original. A demo of the game is currently playable at Grasshopper’s booth at PAX East. \n\nShadows of the Damned was first released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on June 21, 2011, and served as a collaboration between Resident Evil mastermind Shinji Mikami (who served as producer) and Grasshopper founder Goichi “Suda51” Suda (the game's writer). It stars Garcia Hotspur, a demon hunter who battles his way through the depths of the underworld to rescue his captive girlfriend, Paula. The game’s fun, over-the-shoulder shooter action combined with its irreverent, absurd humor earned it a 9.25 out of 10 in our original review and a cult following over the last 13 years. EA originally published Shadows of the Damned, and it was never ported to other platforms. Grasshopper is self-publishing the remaster. \nShadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.",

          "description": "For the 17th time, ScummVM has again been accepted for the Google Summer of Code program this summer.\nThe program intends to bring new contributors into open source projects. In the most recent two years this has included both students and non-students as eligible candidates for participation.\nLike last year, participants can apply for working on either short tasks (about 175 hours of work), or large tasks (about 350 hours of work). The coding period typically runs from start of June through August, but there is some flexibility which allows participants to have longer time frames if they are unable to work full time through the summer.\nScummVM is looking for people interested in participating in GSoC with us. A list of suggested projects can be found on this page, but we are also open to your own ideas as well. Please provide the required information in your application before submitting.\nWe also strongly encourage you to join our Discord server, in the #scummvm-gsoc channel. This allows you to engage with our mentors and the rest of the team, to get advice about how to get involved with the project, as well as writing your application.\nBased on our previous 16 years of experience with GSoC, we have put together a Google Summer of Code miniportal to help you get started.\nLooking forward to hearing from you!\n>",

The titans of industry were inspired to produce more goods when I visited their factories. But as the years have passed, so do their eyes pass over me, to eye curiously my replacements. Will you try the new style, ma’am? It’s so much better than that old thing. I’ve watched my friends grow old and die. My brother got caught in traffic and caused a horrific level crossing collision. I get sick more often, wheezing to a halt wherever I am. When I visit the doctor for a spot of renewal, they tell me, “Sorry, I can’t help. You’re too old.” When will I be autoreplaced? Woe is the tale of the Balogh Goods Truck. But what if we could slow or pause the steady march of time? In OpenTTD 14, you can.",

Exactly 21 years ago, I received an ICQ message (look it up, kids) out of the blue from a guy named Ludvig Strigeus (nicknamed Ludde). “Hello, you probably don’t know me, but I’ve been working on a project to clone TTD for a while.” he said, more or less. He didn’t want to release this to the public yet, and wasn’t entirely sure what he was going to do with it. (He’d been working on it since 30th June 2002, so I guess that is technically the birthday of what would become OpenTTD…) Ludde sent me a copy of what he’d been working on, and it was very exciting indeed. It was a fully functional version of Transport Tycoon Deluxe, written in C. Admittedly incomplete at that time, it was still quite remarkable.",
