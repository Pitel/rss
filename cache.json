It showed him using a rune ability and gave us a brief shot of our hero gliding on some metal contraption in the air…four months ago.

Yet there's still hope among Sunshine fans that perhaps F.L.U.D.D might make another appearance in a 3D Mario game. Until then, however, this mod from JustKant might be the closest we'll get for quite some time (thanks, GoNintendo).\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

If you haven't seen the news yet, Thunderful unveiled SteamWorld Build earlier this evening, the next entry in their genre-hopping series of games about colourful robot pals trying to make their way in the world. As the name implies, this one's a citybuilder, and I've been hands on with an early build of, err, Build, to tell you all about it. No, I'm not sure what's going on with the previously announced Headhunter right now either, but in some ways, I'm glad it's Build that's coming out first. \nAfter all, it's been a hot minute since the last SteamWorld game came out, and Build is shaping up to be the perfect reintroduction to what made this series so special. It goes right back to its roots, reframing that classic SteamWorld Dig story of mining for gold and treasure with a new, management-style eye for town-planning, while also paying homage to where it all began for these jolly old rustbuckets way, way back on the Nintendo DSi. That's right. SteamWorld Build may be a citybuilder on the surface, but down below it's a mining and tower defence 'em up - and having lost several hours to my demo build already, it's really something special. \nRead more",

It’s smart, concise, and I can’t stop playing.\nPlaying as your little green knight, you are given five dice each round to place on a game board. Each one represents a certain action, the basic ones being attacking and defending, but ramping up to mass healing and boosting the stats of other dice. Energy points dictate how many dice you can place on the board, with each one costing the number on its face. Placement is key, as different combinations can lead to better outcomes like, for example, how you can place an attack die in a space affected by a booster die to up its damage.\nRead more",

First and foremost, I recall Far Cry 2: Parasitic Pain, which tasks you with running around begging for pills to stave off a growing infection. Next comes Far Cry 2: Buddy Bonanza, which lets you make lots of lovely AI friends, charge into battles together, and then hide while they die. Then, there’s Far Cry 2: Firewatch, which is all about watching fire. It's the best.\nRead more",

Then it became a deep sense of longing for something I'd lost, like a cascade of sand that fell from my palm as I wept gently on an empty beach. The \"it\" is a mobile and Nintendo Switch game called Pokémon Quest (don't laugh), which was the first - and only -  mobile game I've actively obsessed over.\nThe game's an auto-battler where you gather a small trio from the original 150 Pokéfolks, level them up, and then tackle trickier and trickier stages. After a frankly disgusting number of hours, I'd finished all the stages. So, I thought, \"Yes, of course they will add the 2nd generation of Pokéfolks with a bunch of new stages. This is its natural evolution, if you will\". It still hasn't happened and probably never will. And I hate that I can't find anything else that'll replace it.\nRead more",

What begins as a YA coming-of-age tale about a small-town romance quickly gains remarkable momentum, and suddenly you’re dealing with supernatural teens trying to desperately stop a world-ending calamity. Part sci-fi drama, part high school romance, A Space For The Unbound manages to have incredible weight and grandeur while also being poignant, sweet, and honest at the same time.

Such as, for example, my longstanding belief that Dwarf Fortress would never make the biggest and most important change it possibly could, and fit itself with an interface fit for purpose.\r\n\nBay 12 Games have, of course, gone further than that, and released it for general sale on the biggest shop in the business after sixteen years as freeware. There's even a charming new graphics overhaul to replace the famous ASCII symbols which, depending on who you ask, might not have technically counted as \"graphics\" at all.\nI'm not here to discuss the relative merits of this shiny new version and the \"classic\" version. Both will be updated in future, the latter still free, and neither expected to reach a full 1.0 release inside 20 years. All this chips around the edges of what I've been pondering, which is this: What exactly is Dwarf Fortress's place within our culture now, after a decade replete with games that looked to it for ideas?\nRead more",

Looking back, was I naïve? Yes. And was I wrong? I'm delighted to report that I was catastrophically wrong.\nFrom what I've played so far of Persona 3, I reckon it's well worth a whirl if you're a newcomer, or a Persona 5 fan who's concerned that a game from 2009 won't be all that good. Not only does it stand on its own as a fun high school mystery with an alarmingly dark undertone, it almost acts as a fun history lesson too.\nRead more",

Well, three. Camp one was excited for the TV show and camp two posited that there's no point making an adaptation of something if your adaptation is just the same thing. (The third camp was \"eh, I might check it out\" and watched the other two camps duking it out). I was in camp two. If you're adapting something, adapt! Make changes! Otherwise I might as well just consume the original thing again! The Last Of Us has already been released, what, three times?\nThis was made funnier by the fact that nobody on staff had seen the TV show, so we were just arguing about tweets we'd seen that describe the show, the worst way to conduct a discussion outside of e.g. scrawling insults on the side of Teslas and self-driving them into each other's front doors. But it got me to thinking about adaptations, because there have been loads of adaptations of things that aren't games into video games. What goes wrong in the other direction?\nRead more",

There was a lot to take in, from robo-gloves, to sex-dom vending machines, to grannies with bazookas.\nI went in with expectations that it might be a little like BioShock, all steely and serious in its delivery of some vaguely philosophical truth. But I emerged with a totally different impression. Far from polished seriousness, Atomic Heart seems a little disjointed in its ambition, with a main character who almost immediately kills any atmosphere when he opens his mouth.\nRead more",

          "description": "At a time when LucasArts was cheerfully mocking rival developer Sierra's fondness for punishing players with game overs you could trigger at the drop of a hat, Sierra themselves seemed intent to double down. In Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers, not only can the titular protagonist suffer a variety of gruesome fates if you so much as put a foot wrong, but there's a point where you can soft-lock the entire game by failing to pick up an easily missable single snake scale from a busy crime scene — and you won't even know you did anything wrong for several in-game days. I'm not 100% sure this wasn't an oversight on the part of the developers, but at the same time, that's exactly the sort of shit that Sierra liked to pull.\nRead more",

Farlanders is my messy breakup.\nIt's a space colony city builder with a puzzle game mentality - and set on Mars to make things even more enticing. The best part of Farlanders is its story, and while it’s not quite a full-blown commentary on colonialism, it examines what you’re doing and why you’re doing it with a self-awareness that I did not expect at all. That being said, annoying difficulty curves, awkward terraforming, and frustrating progression systems stop this space colony sim from really taking off. A graph charting my enjoyment over time would look like a child’s drawing of a mountain.\nRead more",

You know, as video game TV shows go. I've yet to sit down and watch it myself, but I'll probably be doing so this evening to see what's what. \nA question I've been pondering in the run-up to The Last Of Us' TV debut, however, is this: if I watch the TV show now, will I really be bothered to actually sit down and play Part 1 when it finally comes to Steam at the beginning of March? 'Cause I sure don't have time (or the inclination) to do both. I think that might be too much The Last Of Us... But what about you, readers? Will you be tuning in, or waiting to play it on PC?

          "description": "The fan-favorite mode makes a return\nInfinity Ward tried some new things with the release of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II — some of them stuck like semtex, and some of them didn't. One change that many players are excited to see reverted is the game's Hardcore mode, or more specifically, its return to the game with MWII's Season 2. The news came via the official Infinity Ward Twitter account, where they announced the return of the mode that makes an already-difficult game even harder. In addition, the studio stated that more updates on what to expect from Season 2 will be coming later this week on their blog.\nHardcore mode isn't for the faint of heart, as it gives players significantly less health, reduces the HUD down to a minimum, and turns friendly fire on. As usual, players will be able to access Hardcore mode through a specific playlist, so don't worry about getting roped into these games by accident — although I wouldn't put it past anyone considering how unnecessarily confusing Modern Warfare II's UI is. The mode dates all the way back to the original Modern Warfare in 2007, so I don't really understand why they didn't include it from launch to begin with. Oh well, something to look forward to I guess.\nhttps://twitter.com/InfinityWard/status/1617220677517381632\nSeason 2 has already been delayed two weeks to February 15, as was correctly predicted by known Call of Duty data miner CODSploitz. In addition to Hardcore mode, the update will include the return of Resurgence mode, as well as \"a brand new small map\" and \"new multiplayer maps, new modes, weapons and much more.\"\nThe post Hardcore mode is coming back for Modern Warfare II’s Season 2 appeared first on Destructoid.",

They've teamed up with everyone from Star Wars to Ariana Grande, and now Fortnite is back with their Gaming Legends Series to collaborate with yet another iconic video game protagonist: Isaac Clarke of Dead Space fame. Clarke serves as the player character of all three Dead Space games, and is described as a \"ship system specialist and necromorph slayer\" by Fortnite's blog post. Yeah, that sounds about right to me.\nClarke is coming to Fortnite in the new Strange Transmissions Quest Pack, which will be available in the Item Shop for $11.99. The pack will include the Isaac Clarke Outfit, the RIG Back Blind, the Plasma Cutter Pickaxe (which comes with a built-in Bench Upgrade Emote), and the Strange Transmissions Quests that can earn you up to 1,500 V-Bucks.\nhttps://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1617673934349942785\nThis Fortnite x Dead Space collaboration lands only four days before the long-awaited Dead Space Remake, which is officially out on Friday January 27, 2023.

          "description": "The whole Strange series will be on the Switch\nThe tale of two brothers is making its way to Nintendo's hybrid console. Life is Strange 2 is coming to Nintendo Switch on February 2, 2023.\nConfirmed today, the second numbered game in the Life is Strange series is currently up for pre-order on the Nintendo eShop.\nThe story of Life is Strange 2 jumps away from Arcadia Bay and into the lives of Sean Diaz and his brother Daniel. After Daniel discovers some secret telekinetic abilities in a dramatic incident, the brothers leave home and go on the road. It's an emotional story about family, as the brothers try to make their way to the border and into Mexico.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6-UEpmxrlE\nTwo wolves\nThe arrival of Life is Strange 2 also ensures that the entire series is now on the Nintendo Switch. The Life is Strange: Remastered Collection, which has both the first game and its prequel Before the Storm, arrived last year. And its third entry, Life is Strange: True Colors, hit the Switch in late 2021.\nWith the entire Life is Strange suite playable on Nintendo Switch, that means the supernatural adventures of all these wayward souls are portable and playable on the Switch platform. It's nice to see too, as Life is Strange 2 can feel a little overlooked compared to the other entries in the series.\nWhile it's from the era of episodic narrative games, it looks like Life is Strange 2 includes all the episodes of the second game as well, in one package. So if this is one that you missed, or maybe you hopped on with True Colors and want to see what else the series has in store, there's another option for experiencing the Diaz brothers' story.\nLife is Strange 2 hits Nintendo Switch on February 2, 2023.\nThe post Life is Strange 2 is headed to Nintendo Switch next month appeared first on Destructoid.",

The overall goal is to dig deeper, unearth the goodies, and ultimately escape the planet.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fd_ZTJtAW88\nIt looks similar to games like Dungeon Keeper or Dwarf Fortress, where you're balancing building a world and digging deeper with the impending dangers surrounding you. There are caves to explore, five different SteamWorld-inspired maps with secrets, and it will be controllable with either controller or mouse and keyboard.\nIf you want to try it out for yourself, you can do so right now too. A demo for SteamWorld Build is live right now as part of the Steam Base Builder Fest, running Jan. 23 through Jan. 30, so you can give this game a shot.\nThe wide, wide world of Steam\nEven if city builders aren't your style, there's more SteamWorld games on the way too. While the team wouldn't go into specifics, Thunderful's Brjann Sigurgeirsson confirms there are four SteamWorld games currently in development. The team didn't discuss what those games were, but hey, that's a lot of SteamWorld.\nAs for SteamWorld Build, no firm date has been set yet but it is planned for both PC and console sometime this year. With a demo already available, I'm personally hoping that's sooner rather than later, as I could go for a good city builder with the wonderful theming that SteamWorld frequently gets right.\nThe post SteamWorld Build takes the franchise into the city builder genre in 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

More episodes of NieR: Automata Ver1.1a have been postponed until further notice.\nIn a statement on social media from the adaptation's official account, the delay is attributed to COVID-related issues.\n\"Due to the impact of COVID-19 on production, we have decided to postpone the broadcast and distribution of episode 4 and all subsequent episodes,\" reads the statement. \"Information regarding the broadcast and distribution schedule for episode 4 and beyond will be announced on the official anime website and official Twitter soon.\"\nhttps://twitter.com/NieRA_anime_EN/status/1616843160000385024\nNo further details were given on how COVID has impacted production. As noted, there also isn't an expected date for the series' return just yet. Three episodes of NieR: Automata Ver1.1a are already available on streaming sites.\nFor the glory of mankind\nThe NieR: Automata anime adaptation looks to follow the events of 2017's fantastic game, though with a few twists of its own in store. Yoko Taro has said that the Ver1.1a is affixed specifically because things are being changed around.\nWhile NieR is certainly a series with many mysteries and lore, it looks like fans will have to wait a while longer to see the rest of what's in store. Though no return date is locked in, hopefully the COVID-related issues resolve quickly and without any impact on those making this series happen.\nIn the meantime, you can always take a walk down memory lane and revisit NieR: Automata. The mod that made the infamous church mystery happen might be something fun to mess around with, to keep that inner lore detective happy until more NieR anime is ready to air.

The remake, which launched in September 2022, found itself sitting at the number 20 spot in the physical retail charts after sales spiked a wild 238% in just one week.\nThe HBO adaptation of The Last of Us premiered on the channel to record audiences, pulling in an estimated 4.7 million viewers for its first episode. The series, which stars Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey, recounts the original game's story of a world-weary man and a young girl thrust together in a journey across a dilapidated United States, its places and people torn apart by a terrifying mass fungal infection.\nElsewhere in the UK Charts, Nintendo's shiny new RPG Fire Emblem Engage debuted at No.1, making it the first new number one of 2023. Fire Emblem Engage displaced Electronic Arts' football sim FIFA 23, which has sat comfortably in the top spot for almost a month now. The remainder of the Top 10 is dominated by Nintendo Switch releases, including Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Nintendo Switch Sports, Pokemon Scarlet & Violet, and, of course, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.\nFor more reporting on HBO's The Last of Us, be sure to check out our hub right here on Destructoid.\nU.K. video game sales chart w/e: January 21, 2023\n(Chart reflects in-store physical sales only)\n1. Fire Emblem Engage — Nintendo\n2.

          "description": "I hope you like pins\nWhenever a new first party Nintendo game creeps up, you know it's time for a physical My Nintendo reward. Whether it's a towel or a keychain (which it is in most cases!), something typically is dumped on the My Nintendo system for people to spend their points on. For Fire Emblem Engage, that physical reward is a pin set.\nThis is in addition to the current sweepstakes they're still running.\nHere's the full description from Nintendo:\n\"This reward contains 16 button pins with these iconic heroes from past Fire Emblem series: Emblem Marth, Emblem Celica, Emblem Sigurd, Emblem Leif, Emblem Roy, Emblem Lyn, Emblem Eirika, Emblem Ike, Emblem Micaiah, Emblem Lucina, Emblem Corrin, and Emblem Byleth. The pin set also includes new characters from Fire Emblem Engage: Veyle, Alear, and the adorable Sommie! The reward size: 8\"x 8\" and each pin size is 1.5 inches.\"\n\nPin set price points typically vary, with the WarioWare set going for 500 Platinum Points (for four larger pins), and the heavy-duty Gold and Platinum point pins going for 800. If you really want these as soon as they're available (which is roughly a wait time of 1-2 weeks, sometimes more), aim for having around 1000 points as a buffer.\nAs a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked.\nThe post A new Fire Emblem Engage My Nintendo reward is on the way appeared first on Destructoid.",

In his post, he wishes everyone at the studio well.\n\"These past 19 years have been a life-changing experience to say the least, and it made the choice to go very difficult,\" wrote Walters. \"I’ve worked with so many wonderful people and had the privilege to be a part of the most amazing teams and projects. It’s hard to fathom it all, and I know I’ll be reflecting on it for years to come.\"\nWalters doesn't confirm what his next step is just yet, but did write that \"with a new year comes new adventures.\"\nThe massive effect\nWalters joined BioWare in 2003, as a writer for the martial arts RPG Jade Empire. He'd then serve as a writer on Mass Effect before moving up to lead writer for Mass Effect 2 and 3, and then head to Anthem to be its narrative director.\nHe'd return to Mass Effect with Andromeda as its creative director, was project director of the Legendary Edition. His last role at BioWare was as Production Director for the upcoming Dragon Age: Dreadwolf.\nThe Dreadwolf has been fairly quiet since we got a subtitle reveal last year, with just a few teases to go on. And the next Mass Effect has had even less to go on. No release window has been set yet for either.\nMeanwhile, this marks another departure for a longtime BioWare veteran, alongside others that have left over the last few years like Casey Hudson, Mark Darrah, and Matt Goldman.\nThe post Mass Effect veteran Mac Walters leaves BioWare appeared first on Destructoid.",

As a reader pointed out to me this past weekend, that prior dual release was on November 2, 2022: 82 days ago as of the time of publication.\nThere are a few games that are currently announced and will be coming out this year, but we don't have release dates for any of them. Here's a refresher.\nHere is what's coming to the Nintendo 64 Switch lineup in 2023:\n1080 Snowboarding\nExcitebike 64\nMario Party 3\nPokemon Stadium\nPokemon Stadium 2\nHarvest Moon 64 (Japan-only)\nSo far, that's all we know about. Naturally, more games could be announced, and in a hypothetical situation, all of these could come out before E3: with a bigger dump arriving in the middle of the year toward the end of 2023. We could even see some sort of upgrade for the Expansion Pack service as a whole, but I wouldn't count on it.\nIn the meantime, this slow drip that's very typical of Nintendo retro re-releases has now become a broken faucet. Since the original launch on October 25, 2021 (has it really been over a year since the Expansion Pack came out?), Nintendo has released 21 games in the west (and 21 games in Japan, since they don't get Dr. Mario 64 and Pokemon Puzzle League).\nAre you cool with it?

          "description": "And yet I still can't download the mobile game from Google Play or the App Store\nThis weekend is the annual Granblue Fantasy Fes event in Japan, and as usual, we’re getting some big announcements from the world of Granblue. Specifically, Granblue Fantasy: Versus is getting an expansion that’s launching worldwide this year. Granblue Fantasy: Versus Rising will feature new stages, new characters, and a new story for players to experience. As you can see in the Versus Rising trailer below, it’s confirmed the game will have rollback net code and crossplay between PS4/PS5 and PC via Steam.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ln58g217C4\nSkimming through the game's website, it's confirmed that all 24 characters from the original game will return for this semi-sequel. Additionally, anybody who missed out on Versus will be able to experience an abridged version of that game's celebrated story mode. If you play a lot of Versus online, know that the online lobby will be completely revamped for Versus Rising and will include the all-new \"Grand Bruise Legends\" mini-game mode.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOVAZg3QJF0\nI guess calling it \"Granblue Fall Guys\" would have been a little too on the nose. Either way, all of that looks great, and it's nice to know that Street Fighter 6 will have some competition this year. Expect Cygames and Arc System Works to reveal more details and new features as we get closer to its launch date. Granblue Fantasy: Versus Rising will release worldwide this year for PS4, PS5, and PC via Steam. And if you're still playing the original Versus, know that the final update for that game will release on January 24.\nThe post Granblue Fantasy: Versus Rising set to launch in 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Tanks for the Memories\nOnce again, retro-lovin' publisher Hamster is reaching into the past of legendary studio Namco for another addition to its massive Arcade Archive range — This week sees the arrival of one of the developer's lesser-known '90s hits, Tank Force, now available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.\nReleased to the arcade market in 1991, Tank Force is the third release in Namco's unofficial \"Tank Battalion\" trilogy — preceded by Tank Battalion (1980) and Battle City (1985). This multi-directional shooter sees up to four players battle it out in top-down, caterpillar-rolling action. A total of seven different tanks are available, all featuring their own respective traits and weapons, and a massive arsenal of 15 weapons and power-ups can be picked up to turn the tide of battle in your favor.\nCheck out the warfaring action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber VideoGaming4U.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsRkKaIYdYo&ab_channel=VideoGaming4U\nFeaturing maze-like maps, destructible environments, land hazards, and winner-takes-all gameplay, Tank Force can be seen as something of an alternate to multiplayer hits such as Irem's cutesy hit Bomberman, though it obviously lacks the charm and charisma of the Hudson Soft series. Tank Force would not be ported to the home market of the 1990s, though it would make a reappearance as part of a number of Namco classic compendiums. Today, Tank Force's dynamic, score-attack-based gameplay has helped attract a niche but devoted community, still chasing those '90s high-score dreams.\nTank Force is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.\nThe post Namco’s 1991 release Tank Force rumbles in the Arcade Archives appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Inflation affects yet another title\nFactorio is one of those games that came out a good while ago, but I hear about it everywhere now, as it's continued to gain steam and further garner a player base as the years have gone on. The base-building strategy game originally came out on Steam in 2016, and its continued success just speaks to some solid game design, if you ask me. Now, seven years later, developers Wube Software have announced that Factorio will be receiving a price increase from $30 to $35 on Steam, and have cited inflation as the explanation for the change.\nhttps://twitter.com/factoriogame/status/1616388275169628162\nThe game originally cost $20 when it was in early access on Steam in 2016, and the price increased to $30 with the release of version 1.0 in 2020. This change goes into effect on January 26, 2023, as per the tweet from Wube. The developers also added a comment to their Steam page that reads, \"We don't have any plans to take part in a sale or to reduce the price for the foreseeable future\" -- and this message is in place before the price increase hits.\nWube's announcement comes in the wake of tons of other inflation-driven price hikes, whether they're for other games, consoles, or streaming services. This is the first I've yet to see of a well-known indie game increasing their price (we've seen this in the AAA space for a while now with the new $70 standard), but I have a feeling it's a trend that's gonna catch on.\nThe post Factorio developers to increase price on Steam due to inflation appeared first on Destructoid.",

An update is here!\nIt always makes me happy to see Sea of Thieves in the news — it's one of those games that I think has a great premise and always delivers on the fun, and it's managed to live on despite threats of a shutdown in 2022. The game is not only alive now, but thriving — evidenced yet again by announced a new update for 2023 that Rare announced this week. This release will focus on matchmaking improvements, as well as the addition of Pet Rocks and a brand new live event called The Secret Wilds. It's always been exciting to be a pirate, but now, even more so.\nThe Secret Wilds event will take over right where the previous PvE event The Rogue's Legacy left off, which explored the backstory of an undead pirate named Captain Briggsy. The event will run from January 18-February 2, so players will have a few weeks to delve further into the mystery.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XresgzEZaT0\nSea of Thieves is also getting a whole host of new cosmetics, including the \"Labyrinth Looter\" set of outfits, guns, and ship accessories themed around the Greek myth of Theseus and the Minotaur. There's also a new emote that has players playing with their very own Pet Rock — I guess if you can't have a parrot, a rock is the next best thing.\nArguably the most exciting changes, however, come in the form of improvements to the game's PvP mode, especially when it comes to its matchmaking systems. In an attempt to make queue times shorter, Rare is introducing a system that will pair players with an opponent from the same faction if load times are too long to make sure that players will always be able to get into a game. In addition, Rare is also increasing the number of PvP arenas from six to 50, and the losing crew in a battle will receive more compensation as an effort to make losses less bothersome.

These cuts arrive in a week full of layoffs at companies across the video game and tech industry.\nAccording to a report from journalist Jacob Wolf, the layoffs are largely focused on talent acquisition, recruiting departments, and its publishing arm, though the esports and support units were also affected. The 46 layoffs account for less than one percent of Riot, which currently sits at over 4,500 worldwide employees.\nIn a statement to Wolf, Riot Games says it \"implemented strategic shifts within a few teams to sharpen [its] focus in a number of areas.\"\n\"With these shifts, certain roles were eliminated, impacting a total of 46 Rioters,\" said a Riot spokesperson in a statement to Wolf. \"This is part of our normal course of our business: We periodically make changes to our structure and our teams based on what we believe will allow us to deliver the best content and experiences for players. We never make these decisions lightly and will always start from a place of wanting to retain Rioters and have them focus on our highest priorities. While that’s not always possible, it’s our primary goal.\"\nRiot Games will continue to hire, with a number of available positions posted on its website.\nOngoing industry layoffs\nThese cuts arrive amidst a week full of industry layoffs, at many video game and tech companies.

As expected, it was a massive success, and a tweet from HBO Max confirmed it: the show surpassed 10 million viewers within two days of its premiere, and that only accounts for the viewers in the United States, according to HBO. Those numbers are broken down into 4.7 million streams on premiere night last Sunday, January 15, which means an additional 5.3 viewers tuned in the following day. I'd bet a good percentage of those people saw the hype online and wanted to see what all the fuss was about, because the series has lit up social media like the Fourth of July this week.\nhttps://twitter.com/Variety/status/1615795010540302338\nWith numbers like that, The Last of Us has secured a spot as the second-most watched premiere of a show on HBO since 2010, second only to House of the Dragon with 9.98 million viewers. While The Last of Us had the benefit of a pre-built fanbase of gamers to flock to the streaming platform on opening night, House of the Dragon had the advantage of being a spin-off of another one of HBO's most successful series of all time: Game of Thrones.\nHBO has also stated that numbers tend to grow significantly in the weeks after a show has premiered, with only 20-40% of its total numbers coming from Sunday night viewership. This means The Last of Us can be expected to be seeing even bigger numbers as time goes on, and as a fan of the series myself, I can imagine it's only a matter of time before even the most hardened skeptics cave to the curiosity — especially when it comes to seeing the adaptations of the show's most iconic scenes that are still ahead.\nThe post The Last of Us HBO series hit a stunning 10 million viewers within 2 days of its premiere appeared first on Destructoid.",

You'll need an active save file from finishing the game, and you might need to restart The Callisto Protocol to see it. With New Game+, you can carry over all your weapons, upgrades, and Callisto Credits from your previous run.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT7swHyN8FQ\nAlongside the new mode, there's also a number of updates to the game itself. General performance optimizations have been made across all platforms, and multiple issues where camera angles or paths could cause the player to fall through the ground have been fixed.\nPlayers should also no longer take damage when vaulting over obstacles, making the environment a little less of an enemy. Other crash areas for specific platforms have been addressed, too. You can find the full patch notes on The Callisto Protocol subreddit here.\nAnd now you're back, from outer space\nThe debut survival horror game from Striking Distance Studios has been gradually patching up its game since launch. The Callisto Protocol had some notable launch issues, some of which we experienced ourselves during our review process.\nIt's been nice to at least see some of the technical issues get addressed alongside new options like New Game+ rolling out. If you're someone who's wanted to do a second run through the space-jail horror experience, this seems like a good reason to do so.\nStriking Distance was also the subject of a recent report, where several former developers alleged their names were left off the credits for the game.\nThe post The Callisto Protocol gets New Game+ in latest update appeared first on Destructoid.",

Fans of The Witcher 3 who want to have the game available in physical form for their PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X are in luck, because CD Projekt Red is releasing The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Complete Edition in the European and North American regions next week on January 26.\nhttps://twitter.com/witchergame/status/1616406686734110723\nThe Complete Edition will of course include the base game, as well as the game's previously released DLCs, Blood and Wine and Heart of Stone. This edition will also come along with the the recent next-gen update that the game received in December, which mainly focused on quality-of-life changes, as well as extras like a new quest, a photo mode, cross-platform progression, new outfits inspired by The Witcher's Netflix series, and more.\nWhat's more, we also got news that CD Projekt Red is also working on some improvements to the next-gen PC version of the game, which is in desperate need of a patch when it comes to performance issues. These problems have persisted after a hotfix patch from the studio, and experts have suggested that the game will need a more intensive overhaul in order to run more smoothly on the PC platform.\nThe post The Witcher 3 is getting a physical release for next-gen consoles next week appeared first on Destructoid.",

This allows the Maiden in Black to be posed in a variety of demure and evocative stances, bringing a sense of morose disquiet to anybody's bookshelf or work desk. The maiden comes packaged with a selection of alternate hands, as well as her huge, path-lighting torch. Three variants of her skirt are included, in order to facilitate both sitting and standing poses.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThazDMOKDyY&ab_channel=MAXFACTORYCHANNEL\nA rarity for the Figma format, Good Smile Co. has released a video of our girl, perhaps aware of the maiden's mammoth fan base and the likelihood that she will be one of the more popular Figmas.\nIf you would like to invite The Maiden in Black Figma into the warmth of your home, then you can pre-order her right now over at the official Good Smile Co. store and other import retailers. The Maiden retails for ¥12,800 (or roughly $93 USD) not including shipping or any potential custom charges. Unfortunately, it will take her a long time to make her way from The Nexus to your house, as global shipping is not expected until January 2024. Still, what a wonderful guest to ring in the new year.\nDemon's Souls is available now on PS5.\nThe post Demon Souls’ Maiden in Black is available to pre-order in Figma form appeared first on Destructoid.",

The same day, Halo Infinite creative director Joseph Staten, who joined the studio in 2020 to help bring the game across the finish line, revealed that he was departing 343 Industries to rejoin Xbox Publishing.

That means replaying one of the greatest games of the PS1 era, Silent Hill! \nIn 1999, Konami put the fear of fog in a generation of players with the release of Silent Hill. The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that's (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later.

A statement from the president of Polyphony Games details that “While 2-player splitscreen races are not supported in VR, all other races, including online races, will be available.” In case you missed it, Resident Evil Village will also get a VR update on launch day.\nThis list of 13 joins the existing lineup of 11 VR games PlayStation announced last November and the six games announced in December. Combined with other previously announced titles, like Horizon: Call of the Mountain, PlayStation VR2 will have over 30 games available to play within a month of launch.\nPlayStation VR2 is set to come out on February 22, just over a month from today. A few months ago, we learned that the base model will cost $549.99, with the option to bundle it with Horizon Call the Mountain for an additional $50.\nFor more on Sony’s new VR headset, check out our hands-on preview from last year, or listen to our reactions to the initial launch details.",

That first Scarlet and Violet expansion arrives this March (alongside various changes, including a price increase), but first, we have one more Sword and Shield expansion to get to.\nPokémon Trading Card Game: Sword & Shield – Crown Zenith, out this week, adds more than 160 new cards, including 3 new Radiant Pokémon, five Pokémon VMax cards, eight Pokémon VStar cards, and 70 cards with special Galarian Gallery artwork. The Pokémon Company sent over some of the products in this special expansion, and we cracked them to see what we could pull.\nThough I'm frustrated you can't buy these as individual booster packs (they're only available in larger packs like the Elite Trainer Box and special collections), I absolutely love several of the cards I pulled. In particular, the full-art cards are absolutely striking. I'm very happy with the Radiant Charizard, and the Pikachu and Lucario cards might be among my favorites of those respective Pokémon. You can see the full gallery below.\n\nPokémon Trading Card Game: Sword & Shield – Crown Zenith arrives starting on January 20 with the Elite Trainer Box and Collections starring Regieleki V or Regidrago V.

The game received a special edition release with added in content in 2008 with FES, and was then re-released a third time for PSP in 2010 with the most added content, but some modifications made to run on Sony's handheld platform.\nPersona 4 followed – again a mild hit – but then Persona 5 came along and cemented the franchise's reputation as one of the best RPGs ever made. Fans who discovered the series with 5 have wanted to figure out what they've been missing out on, and longtime players have been demanding the re-release of 3 so that a larger audience could play what many call their favorite. After arguably too long, Atlus is finally ready to make that happen with the re-re-re-release of Persona 3 on modern consoles January 19.\nJoin Kyle Hilliard and Wesley LeBlanc as they look at the game's first true dungeon and chat about perhaps the most controversial Persona game in the series.\n\n\nFor more previews of some of the biggest games of 2022 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for NGTs about Vengeful Guardian: Moonrider, Fire Emblem Engage, Clive 'N' Wrench, Inkulinati, Outer Terror, and more.",

The service began issuing refunds for all hardware last November, but if you haven’t received one yet, information on how to obtain one should have been emailed to the Google account used to make the purchase. However, past Stadia Pro subscriptions will not receive refunds.\nThere's a silver lining for those of you with Stadia controllers and nothing to use them for. You can download an update that will allow your controller to use Bluetooth. However, be warned: this permanently disables wi-fi capabilities, so if you download the update now, you won't be able to play Stadia games before the shutdown. For more details, you can visit the Stadia Help Center.\nStadians, you can now update your Stadia Controller’s firmware to enable Bluetooth Low Energy connections.\nhttps://t.co/o0iU2x0NsV pic.twitter.com/SxzUYJyRrh\nJanuary 17, 2023\nIf you missed the news about the shutdown, last September, Stadia’s VP and General Manager said in a blog post that “while Stadia's approach to streaming games for consumers was built on a strong technology foundation, it hasn't gained the traction with users that we expected so we’ve made the difficult decision to begin winding down our Stadia streaming service.” \nStadia’s struggles were no secret. Its first-party studios were shut down just over a year in, with the service being “deprioritized” a year later. While it was an interesting experiment, some experiments are just destined to fail. Rest in peace, Stadia.",

We look forward to fans around the world enjoying the rest of the season.\" \n\"Our focus was simply to make the best possible adaption of this beloved story for as big an audience as we could,\" Druckmann and Mazin said, according to Deadline. \"We are overjoyed to see how many fans, both old and new, have welcomed The Last of Us into their homes and their hearts.\" \nWhile waiting for this week's episode, read our interview with Druckmann and Joel actor Pedro Pascal about how The Last of Us was changed for TV, and then read about how there are no plans for The Last of Us show to go beyond the games. \n[Source: Deadline]",

Most years have one or two records set, but four is a big deal.\n2023 marks the 14th year that the biannual charity marathon has taken place. They have two main events in the winter and summer, but they also hold smaller events throughout the year.

Since it was founded in 2010, the organization has raised over $43 million for charity.\nAGDQ was initially set to be in person but was moved online due to COVID concerns. Their summer event, Summer Games Done Quick, will be held from May 28 - June 4, though it's unclear whether the event will also take place in person.\nDid you watch this year's AGDQ?

For The Elder Scrolls Online, ZeniMax Online Studios will unveil 2023's major chapter update, \"including the latest regions of Tamriel to become playable in ESO, as well as a major new feature coming in the game's biggest update this year.\" A full \"ESO Chapter Reveal Event\" will follow this Developer Direct.

          "description": "Final Fantasy XVI is due out June 22 exclusively on PlayStation 5, but some fans believe a PC version of the game could release as soon as six months after its console debut. However, FF16 producer Naoki Yoshida isn't sure why. \nDuring a recent Final Fantasy XIV stream, Yoshida, who is a director on that game, was asked about rumors surrounding a PC version of FF16, and he responded, \"I don't know where the notion of a PC version releasing six months after the game is out came from as none of us have ever said that,\" according to a translator, as reported by Eurogamer. He followed it up with two instances urging fans to buy the PS5 version. \nAccording to a translation by Siliconera, Yoshida also said, \"There's been talk that the PC version will come out, but no one on the team has said anything about the PC version. I wonder why people assume the PC version will arrive six months after [the PS5 version], so just go ahead and buy a PS5.\" \nThe talk of a PC version of the game stems from a promotional PlayStation 5 video released last year that says in small print that FF16 will be a \"PS5 exclusive for six months.\" Some extrapolated from this small print that a PC release of the game will come after that six months of exclusivity is up, but if Yoshida's recent comments are any indication, the team has nothing to say in regards to a PC version. \nFinal Fantasy XVI hits PlayStation 5 on June 22. While waiting for more information, watch this \"Ambition\" trailer that reveals more about Valisthea's kingdoms, dominants, and eikons, and then check out our interview with Yoshida about the game's boss fights. \n[Source: Eurogamer]\nAre you picking up Final Fantasy XVI on PS5 or waiting for the rumored PC release?

Here's what Druckmann told THR specifically: \"We have no plans to tell any stories beyond adapting the games. We won't run into the same issue as Game of Thrones since The Last of Us Part: II doesn't end on a cliffhanger.\" \n\n\nDruckmann and TV series writer Craig Mazin have mentioned that a second season of this show might cover the events of The Last of Us Part II (personally, I think The Last of Us Part II could cover two seasons of television). Despite the duo not wanting the show to go beyond the games, there might be a way for the show to cover more ground after the events of The Last of Us Part II. If Naughty Dog were to develop a theoretical The Last of Us Part III, it wouldn't be surprising if the HBO show covered that down the road. Chances seem pretty good considering Druckmann told THR that there is \"more story to tell\" in the world of The Last of Us games. \nMazin also touched on his desire not to extend the show beyond the games in the THR interview, as noted by GameSpot, stating that he doesn't \"have any interest in a spinning-plates-go-on-forever show.\" \n\"When it becomes a perpetual motion machine, it just can't help but get kind of...stupid,\" he continued. \"Endings mean everything to me.\" \nFor more about The Last of Us on HBO, read our interview with Joel actor Pedro Pascal and Druckmann about the changes made for this TV show. Check out this new piece of concept art from The Last of Us multiplayer game that Naughty Dog is currently developing after that. \n[Source: GameSpot via The Hollywood Reporter]\nWhat scene are you most excited to see in The Last of Us on HBO?
