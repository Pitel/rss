          "description": "From strategy tributes to puzzle RPGs...\nWith the closure of the 3DS eShop fast approaching, it's got us feeling a little bit nostalgic here at Nintendo Life — particularly for games that we never got our hands on here in the West.\nIt's a tale as old as time at this point. Many Japan-only games never get localised, and that's been the case for a long time, but the 3DS has some truly special and unique titles that we've been begging for over the years. We've talked about Virtual Console games in Japan before, but now it's time to look and pine after those that were available both on the shelves and on the eShop, but that we were never lucky enough to see get an official English release.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "\"Our priority now is to start on the homework that has been piling up\".\nIn a recent interview with Nintenderos, Vanillaware president George Kamitani admitted that he wants to bring Wii Metroidvania Muramasa: The Demon Blade to modern consoles one day. However, there are things stopping it.\nVanillaware has been on a bit of a roll lately with Switch ports. In 2022, the critically acclaimed sci-fi adventure game 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim got a near-flawless port on the console, and in a few months' time, PS2 RTS GrimGrimoire is getting an enhanced rerelease called GrimGrimoire OnceMore. And while Kamitani wants the beautiful Edo Japan-set Metroidvania to join those two titles (Odin Sphere and Dragon's Crown have both also received ports on other consoles), it's not so easy.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

When we first saw the trailer for Shoulders Of Giants, a few people on team responded with murmurings of \"What the hell is this?\", which increased in frequency and volume as more bizarre things appeared on screen. I sort of did what the Goonies do when they first find the map to One Eyed Willie's treasure, or what anyone in Pulp Fiction does when they open the briefcase: \"Wooooaaaah.\"\nConsider the progress of information. It's a sci-fi roguelike best played, I think, in 4-player online co-op. You play a sword-wielding combat mech. You also control a small frog standing on the mech. You drop onto proc-gen planets overrun by a kind of magical accelerated entropy, that turns everything black and pink and grey. By destroying totemic altars orbited by floating eyeball robots, you start to re-energise the planet, so areas have grass and butterflies. Eventually you will destroy enough totems to get to a planetary boss fight, which might be against, for example, a giant ghost samurai or a floating purple hand with an eyeball in it. It's mad, but I sure do wish more games were like this.\nRead more",

You wander around your home for the last time, choosing five objects which inspire deep memories that spur each of the five senses. You then place them into a cauldron one by one, your mother keeping a watchful eye. The ritual comes to an end and the result is a small glowing pendant that will protect you from the dangers of the outside world. “You must promise me never to take the pendant off,” your mother says. The Goodbye ritual is finished, and you leave, knowing you’ll never see your mother or your hometown ever again, all as the prophecy foretold.\nIt’s a fantastic - if sad - start to Season, and gets straight to the heart of the adventure ahead of you. This is a world where prayers, rituals, and prophecies hold great weight, and where you'll be exploring the fragility and fickleness of memory. Underpinning everything is a deeply profound sense of melancholy - and here I was expecting some relaxing two-wheeling through lovely-looking landscapes. Well, turns out Season is a lot more than a pretty travelogue.\nRead more",

One that doesn't feature on that list but has attracted strong reviews elsewhere is the Edifier R1280T, a 2.0 studio speaker set that delivers excellent sound for the money. These speakers are normally normally around £100, but today on Overclockers you can grab a pair for £84 - lower than they've ever been before. \nRead more",

While Alice Bee hammers her review together, I’ve been on my usual hardware bullshit, mainly investigating the peculiar system requirements that were released last week. \r\n\n\r\nThese aren’t just an odd collection of specs because of the sheer weight and breadth of their demands; they also overtly target resolutions and framerates that hardly anyone is going to be engaging with. Who on desktop plays at 1280x720? Fewer than 0.3% of Steam users, apparently. And personally, if I’ve spent the cash on a 1440p gaming monitor, I probably wouldn’t be satisfied to watch it display my games at just 30fps. I’ve therefore been finding out what PC hardware Forspoken actually needs to run both smoothly and at more realistic resolutions. Maybe then we can update those system requirements to create some very-much-unofficial, but hopefully more useful, spec guidelines.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The type of thing that fell very much into the 'touch anything and you're dead' bracket of early adventure games. Getting eaten by sharks, burned to death by a dragon, and the awkward fate of being dragged into space through a shattered mirror were just some of the ways you could cop it on the black and white Apple Macintosh original. Heck, if you lost your torch while exploring, you'd also fall and break your neck within minutes. Happy days! No doubt, then, that you'll be pleased to hear that the original creators are now making a Shadowgate sequel for PC, more than 35 years after its initial release. Beyond Shadowgate is launching a Kickstarter campaign on February 18th, and promises lots more ridiculous ways to pop your clogs. \nRead more",

But secondly, that some people really put a lot of store on interactivity. Including me!

          "description": "Most deckbuilding strategy games see you create a single deck of cards over the course of the game. With every completed stage, you're given the chance to add in new cards and take out old duffers, carefully honing those rough edges until it's your very own death by paper cut machine. Mahokenshi isn't most other deckbuilders, though. Here, you're tasked with creating a fresh deck of cards each time you start a new mission, bolstering your initial crop of starter attacks and movement cards with new, more powerful attacks on the fly as you move around its hex-based landscapes. Some can be found out in the wild, but most of them you'll be buying from village merchants, before upgrading them at dojos dotted around the map. And at the end the mission, they're all swept away. \nIt's certainly a refreshing take on deckbuilding, and it lends itself to even more spontaneous wins and comebacks than the usual frisson of tension you get from simply drawing a good or bad hand. But with main story missions quickly ramping up in difficulty, that scramble for bigger and better cards up front is often Mahokenshi's undoing. The whims of chance are felt more keenly than ever in Game Source Studio's debut deckbuilder, and they never quite felt like they're tipped in your favour.\nRead more",

If you haven't seen the news yet, Thunderful unveiled SteamWorld Build earlier this evening, the next entry in their genre-hopping series of games about colourful robot pals trying to make their way in the world. As the name implies, this one's a citybuilder, and I've been hands on with an early build of, err, Build, to tell you all about it. No, I'm not sure what's going on with the previously announced Headhunter right now either, but in some ways, I'm glad it's Build that's coming out first. \nAfter all, it's been a hot minute since the last SteamWorld game came out, and Build is shaping up to be the perfect reintroduction to what made this series so special. It goes right back to its roots, reframing that classic SteamWorld Dig story of mining for gold and treasure with a new, management-style eye for town-planning, while also paying homage to where it all began for these jolly old rustbuckets way, way back on the Nintendo DSi. That's right. SteamWorld Build may be a citybuilder on the surface, but down below it's a mining and tower defence 'em up - and having lost several hours to my demo build already, it's really something special. \nRead more",

It’s smart, concise, and I can’t stop playing.\nPlaying as your little green knight, you are given five dice each round to place on a game board. Each one represents a certain action, the basic ones being attacking and defending, but ramping up to mass healing and boosting the stats of other dice. Energy points dictate how many dice you can place on the board, with each one costing the number on its face. Placement is key, as different combinations can lead to better outcomes like, for example, how you can place an attack die in a space affected by a booster die to up its damage.\nRead more",

You'll have two chances in total, so don't miss your opportunity to grab it! Here's how to start (and finish) the process of unlocking it, and how to locate it.\nHere are when the Pokemon Scarlet & Violet Greninja events start\nJanuary 27-January 28, 2023\nFebruary 10-February 12, 2023\nFirst you need to unlock high-end raids\nIf you haven't already, finish up the game (quick, you only have a few more days!), and clear the required post-game questline. This will enable seven-star raids, which can be found on the world map or joined via online play.\nWe have a full guide on how to unlock them here.\n[gallery link=\"file\" columns=\"2\" size=\"large\" ids=\"360012,360014\"]\nLocate the Greninja raid on the main map, and host a raid yourself\nWhen you have the proper requirements unlocked, seven-star raids will appear on your map. You can locate them via flashing poison icons (more info on how to discern specific icons here).\nJust head there and interact with the raid den to start a Tera Raid battle. You'll want to go online, and use strong Pokemon for seven-star raids: preferably at level 100.\n[gallery link=\"file\" columns=\"2\" size=\"large\" ids=\"360010,360011\"]\nSearch for a Greninja raid, even if you don't have one available\nAlternatively, if you don't want to host a raid (or don't have any available to trigger), you can search for them online.\nConnect to the internet, then select the Poke Portal in the main menu. Select Tera Raid Battle, then search for a Greninja on the list (image silhouette above). As soon as you see it click it: as you'll get a lot of competition from would-be players trying to join.

The story took place in the mid-90s, as characters hitchhiked across the fictional nation of Petria in order to escape its authoritarian regime. While the game didn't always stick the landing, it was generally well received, and was considered a successful experiment in trying something totally new when it comes to storytelling in games.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fYO2XC33tQ\nNow, two years after Road 96's release, developers Digixart have announced that they're working on a prequel, which is titled Road 96: Mile 0 and will take place right before the events of the first game. The story will follow two teenagers, Zoe and Kaito (the former is a character players will recognize from the original Road 96), and will switch between them as their journey challenges \"their friendship and everything they believe in.\"\nMile 0 will also deviate from its predecessor in that it will include playable musical sections, and if that music is anywhere near as catchy as the song playing over the announcement trailer, we'll be in for a treat. Road 96: Mile 0 will release on April 4 for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and PC.\nThe post Digixart announces Road 96: Mile 0, a musical prequel to the acclaimed procedural narrative adventure appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Check out Abzû's chill older brother\nIf you've yet to play Giant Squid's gorgeous action-adventure title The Pathless, now's your chance, because it's finally getting a port to the Nintendo Switch and Xbox next week on February 2. The game is already available to play on pretty much every other platform, including PlayStation, Steam, Epic Games Store, and Apple Arcade. Porting it out to the two remaining major consoles will make The Pathless as widely accessible as it gets, which is a pretty big deal for an indie game.\nhttps://twitter.com/A_i/status/1618655130026393614\nIn the game, the player takes on the role of the Hunter, \"a master archer who travels to a mystical island to dispel a curse of darkness that grips the world.\" There's an emphasis on smooth, acrobatic-like platforming and making slick trick shots alongside an eagle companion who will help you along on your journey. The game even offers some boss fights to add a bit of challenge, but overall, exploring the open world entirely uninhibited will lull you into a soothing flow state in no time.\nGiant Squid is also the developer behind the calming diving game Abzû, and they've managed to further build upon their gameplay systems to create a relaxing yet engaging experience with The Pathless. If you're looking for a short experience to dive into for an evening, The Pathless is a great bet with the average playthrough coming in at around five hours.\nThe post The Pathless is coming to Nintendo Switch and Xbox in February appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The Last of Us is still a little up in the air, though\nIt sounds like Naughty Dog could be getting past Nathan Drake. In a new interview, co-president Neil Druckmann says the studio is \"moving on\" from the Uncharted series.\nSpeaking to Buzzfeed, Druckmann started off discussing a potential The Last of Us Part 3. He says Sony has supported the studio in following its passions. Despite the success of certain games, Druckmann says, there hasn't been pressure to keep a series going.\n\"That's not the case,\" said Druckmann. \"For us, Uncharted was insanely successful—Uncharted 4 was one of our best selling games—and we're able to put our final brushstroke on that story and say that we're done. We're moving on.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hh5HV4iic1Y\nFor Naughty Dog at least, that sounds like a lid on the Uncharted series, or at least for Nathan Drake's portion of it. Though, for The Last of Us, the situation's a little different. The team is currently working on its multiplayer experience set in The Last of Us universe, which it plans to share more info on this year. But The Last of Us Part 3? That's a different question.\n\"Likewise, with The Last of Us, it's up to us whether we want to continue it or not,\" said Druckmann. \"Our process is the same thing we did when we did Part 2, which is if we can come up with a compelling story that has this universal message and statement about love—just like the first and second game did—then we will tell that story. If we can't come up with something, we have a very strong ending with Part 2 and that will be the end.\"\nThe last Last of Us\nWhile Druckmann's comments indicate Naughty Dog is moving on from Nathan Drake, it could still leave the window open for other studios to pick up the series. Either way, The Last of Us multiplayer is what we know Naughty Dog is working on for sure, as its adaptation keeps rolling on over at HBO.\nThe post Naughty Dog is ‘moving on’ from Uncharted appeared first on Destructoid.",

While most of the Lunar New Year cosmetics are time-limited, these three skins are permanent additions to the Dead by Daylight catalog.\nAside from the Resident Evil content, Dead by Daylight will also be celebrating the Lunar New Year with the new Moonlight Burrow event. This will see the realm decorated in creepy, rabbit-themed iconography, while affording players boosted Bloodpoints and themed rewards. Be sure to keep an eye out for the returning Red Envelopes, which will feature a variety of rare prizes and in-game bonuses. For full details on this new event, check out Behavior Interactive's official blog...

I've been following its development for years at this point, and have become a regular lurker on the Witchbrook subreddit, which mostly exists to speculate about when the game will be coming out.  The title is basically a combination of Stardew Valley and the wizard school franchise that shall not be named, and as a fan of cozy simulation games, that's a match made in heaven for me.\nToday, the team at developer and publisher Chucklefish — who was also the original publisher of Stardew Valley — took to Twitter to let us know that yes, they're still working on Witchbrook. They also made sure to emphasize in the thread that their in-house studio has a no-crunch policy, hence the long development time. Hey, if waiting a little while longer means no one is pushing themselves too hard trying to get the game out, I am perfectly happy to wait.\nhttps://twitter.com/Witchbrook/status/1618646484601405441\nThe most recent update we got was in June of last year with some new screenshots and a Steam listing, and even that was the first news we had heard about the game in two years. We still don't have any idea how far out Witchbrook really is, but thankfully I have some other cozy games like Disney's Dreamlight Valley to tide me over for a while. If you're interested in checking it out, you can wishlist the game on Steam and follow along on Chucklefish/Witchbrook's socials to keep up with any more news that might be coming our way.\nThe post Chucklefish popped in to reassure fans that Witchbrook is still in development appeared first on Destructoid.",

Melodies of Steel 2 will see the surviving crew members of the first title as they continue their journey through the battlefields of an alternate World War II — living out their lives in and around the aging battle tank, Taranis.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hydneoxIkJ0&ab_channel=CyberConnect2OFFICIALCHANNEL\nThe original game was highly praised for its grim themes of loss, bravery, and sacrifice, portrayed by a cast of interesting characters and daubed in a fanciful art style. It is expected that Melodies of Steel 2 will retain the taut drama and never-say-die spirit of the original game, bolstered by improved and expanded combat mechanics, new characters, and hazardous new locales. One can likely assume that the powerful, all-consuming Soul Cannon will once again be ready to lock 'n' load. Wanna draw straws?\nFuga: Melodies of Steel 2 launches May 11 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms. It will arrive on Xbox Game Pass on launch day. In addition, a Digital Deluxe Edition will feature a selection of bonus items, including a digital art book and soundtrack and a variety of alternate skins, in-game items, and a \"Dummy Soul\", allowing for a single stay of execution when matters look bleakest.\nThe post Fuga: Melodies of Steel 2 brings high drama May 11 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Players can participate in a public vote for their team of choice before fighting it out for Clout Points in a weekend of super-sticky mayhem. Our hosts will then reveal the grand winner when the curtain falls on February 13. Who you got? Don't bet on white. It's not going to win.\nhttps://twitter.com/NintendoEurope/status/1618539655586095106?s=20&t=8Wdawb8Bia4Zx4QWq2FNmw\nI'm a Dark chocolate fan, myself, though that's more of a medicinal thing — my stomach hates milk, y'see — but I can imagine this particularly sweet battle could be fairly heated. And it will also be interesting to see how global tastes differ from each other. To celebrate the announcement of this new splatfest, I'm probably going to eat some chocolate every day in the lead up to the event, and during, and then after.\nWe'll be sure to give you a reminder when the big weekend approaches. Until then, take a look at the results for the last splatfest, which saw Frye bag her first-ever victory, after campaigning for Team Sweet.\nSplatoon 3 is available now on Nintendo Switch.\nThe post Splatoon 3 next splatfest set to tickle your chocolate tastebuds appeared first on Destructoid.",

Following in the wake of the big-budget revival of Doom in 2016 and the indie hot flash of Dusk in 2018, there are now a tonne of indie games vying for recognition in the genre. It’s a bit overwhelming, to be honest. It’s a favorite genre of mine, but it seems hard to separate the wheat from the chaff. My current approach is to just dump milk over all of them and dig in.\nDread Templar is in the bowl. Having entered Early Access back in August 2021, it’s finally time for it to get its 1.0 and get kicked out the door. I wasn’t quite sure what would make it stand out back in its initial test period, and now I’m even less sure.\n[caption id=\"attachment_359682\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot…",

The roughly 45-minute showcase spotlighted a taste of the year ahead for Xbox studios, running the gamut from updates on big launches to an out-now surprise.\nIt was, I think, a pretty solid showcase. Direct and to-the-point, the studios under Microsoft's banner showed off just what's in store in the coming months and year. Granted, this isn't all that Xbox has in store; we didn't see Starfield, though we knew we wouldn't going in.\nThis felt like a nice check-in for the new year.

Fans have been anxiously awaiting their newest release, vampire FPS Redfall. The game will feature a roster of playable characters who all utilize unique abilities to take down the vampires that are terrorizing the isolated town of Redfall. We got an in-depth look at what to expect from the gameplay during today's Xbox and Bethesda Games Showcase, including character skill trees, a whole host of weapons and gadgets, and encounters that players will come across in the game's \"immersive open world.\" The most exciting news of all, though, is the official release date for Redfall, which the developers from Arkane announced as May 2, 2023.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR8GVePOdpY\nFrom where I stand, Redfall really looks like a culmination of everything Arkane has created so far, such as the studio's focus on complex problem-solving with multiple ways to approach any given situation, allowing players to truly craft their build around how they want to play with different items and skill trees, and of course their endlessly-compelling means of storytelling through complex characters and environments.

The whole world, from its action and combos to the traps and scenery, moves to the rhythm.\nPlaying as Chai, a \"defect\" who can detect the rhythm of the world, you team up with pals to take on your enemies. It's got a vibe similar to something like Sunset Overdrive, and I'm very much down for it.\nhttps://twitter.com/TangoGameworks/status/1618344785357447221\nThe team wants it to be playable for those who aren't so rhytmically inclined too, though. Chai's cat, the appropriately named 808, can keep the beat for you as a little helper drone. And a marker at the bottom of the screen can also track the BPM for you.\nWhile Tango Gameworks may be known for series like The Evil Within or the more recent Ghostwire: Tokyo, which falls more into the dark and scary, Hi-Fi Rush is a bit of a departure.

Join host Marcus Stewart with Kyle Hilliard on the sticks as the pair get to the bottom of whatever the heck is happening on this island and blast these critters back to extinction. \nWatch on Twitch!\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

In addition to detailing how players will liberate the town of Redfall from its vampiric captors, the team also shared a release date: May 2.\nThe bulk of the presentation showed off how players, either alone or working with up to three other friends, will cleanse Redfall of vampires neighborhood by neighborhood. In addition to gathering intel about the island and completing side quests, such as rescuing human hostages, you’ll capture safehouses. These become additional human HQs, and gaining more brings you closer to battling the area’s ruling vampire underboss. These elite enemies boast unique attacks and require your full might, along with your team’s efforts, to kill for good.\n\n\nWe also got a look at vampire nests. A giant heart fuels these otherworldly dens, and infiltrating one means cutting the heart from the body. Swarms of vampires will try to stop you, of course, but succeeding causes the collapse of a nest, meaning you’ll have to get out fast. Additionally, Arkane showed off the Shroud enemy type, a vampire that can blanket areas in pitch darkness, fire projectiles, as well as phase through floors to evade danger. We also saw a little more of the heroes’ specialized abilities and upgrades, such as granting Layla’s umbrella with a perk that allows it to absorb and fire incoming bullets. \nRedfall will be available on Xbox Series X/S and PC and will be available on Game Pass at launch.",

And if you know anything about the studio's previous games, it's a shocking departure in style, tone, and gameplay. \nHi-Fi Rush is a rhythm action where combat, traversal, and even cutscenes all play to the beat of the game's soundtrack. Aesthetically, Hi-Fi Rush sits somewhere between Insomniac Games' Sunset Overdrive and a Saturday morning cartoon – which is to say, bright, over-the-top, and colorful. A far cry from Tango's other outings, such as The Evil Within series and last year's Ghostwire: Tokyo, which both emphasize horror and the supernatural. \nCheck out the trailer below:\n\n\nHi-Fi Rush is available later today on PC and Xbox consoles via Game Pass. It's directed by John Johanas, who previously directed The Evil Within 2. It features licensed music from Nine Inch Nails, The Black Keys, The Prodigy, and more.",

In addition to new details on PvP, we learned the game is coming to Xbox and PC on April 18, just a few months from now. Like most first-party Xbox titles, it will be available on Game Pass day one. We also got a new gameplay trailer, which you can watch below.\n\n\nIf you're unfamiliar, Minecraft Legends is an action strategy game where players explore a procedurally generated world to find resources, build bases, and save the overworld. In the campaign, which can be played solo or co-op, players work together to stop Piglins from invading their world from the Nether. While traditional Minecraft gameplay has the player placing each individual block, this game allows you to build on a larger scale, placing walls, traps, and turrets. \nIn the PvP mode, two teams of up to four players will face off in a battle to destroy the other team's base. Like the campaign, the world is procedurally generated, so every match is different. Throughout the showcase, developers at Mojang and Blackbird Interactive detailed their favorite strategies, like layering walls with traps in between or exploring the world to find rare mobs. Multiplayer also features cross-platform play and online matchmaking.\nA blog post on the Xbox website also announced that a Deluxe Edition would be available at launch. It includes the base game and a bonus pack of skins.

          "description": "Last week, The Last of Us' premiere scored HBO's second largest debut for an original series since 2010. And now, Episode 2 of The Last of Us, \"Infected,\" has broken another HBO record.\n\"Infected\" brought in 5.7 million viewers across HBO and HBO Max streams, marking a 22% increase over last week's 4.7-million premiere. That increase is the largest audience increase from a first episode to a second episode for an original drama series on HBO in the network's history, as first reported by Variety. HBO calls it the \"largest week 2 audience growth for an HBO Original drama series in the history of the network,\" which speaks further to the wide success of The Last of Us. \nWeirdly enough, even though HBO is usually quick to capitalize on series success with an announcement of a second or sequel season, it has not yet done that for The Last of Us, although every sign points to a greenlight for a Season 2. \nEpisode 1 of The Last of Us crossed 10 million viewers after just two days last week and now, Variety reports that it is tracking 18 million, which is nearly four times its premiere night audience. \nWhile waiting for this week's episode, read our interview with game co-creator Neil Druckmann and Joel actor Pedro Pascal about how The Last of Us was changed for TV, and then read about how there are no plans for The Last of Us show to go beyond the games. \n[Source: Variety]\nDid you like Episode 2 more than Episode 1?

The same day, Halo Infinite creative director Joseph Staten, who joined the studio in 2020 to help bring the game across the finish line, revealed that he was departing 343 Industries to rejoin Xbox Publishing. Some saw this as a final blow of sorts to Halo Infinite and 343 Industries, but there's no official indication that Halo Infinite's course is changing following these layoffs. \nStill, rumors on the back of a report claimed that 343 Industries would no longer be developing Halo games, as other developers would do that in the future, while the studio served more as an overseer to the franchise. However, 343 Industries studio head Pierre Hintze was quick to get ahead of this rumor and posted the following on Twitter over the weekend: \npic.twitter.com/03Xm3a9s59\nJanuary 21, 2023\nIt's a short and sweet way for Hintze to say that the reporting is false, as are the rumors, and that future mainline Halo games will continue to be developed by 343 Industries, which has developed Halo 4, Halo 5: Guardians, and Halo Infinite. \nFor more, read Game Informer's Halo Infinite review. \nDo you think 343 Industries should continue to develop Halo games?

          "description": "We concluded 2022 by returning to our Super Replay roots by tackling an old-school survival horror game. That means replaying one of the greatest games of the PS1 era, Silent Hill! \nIn 1999, Konami put the fear of fog in a generation of players with the release of Silent Hill. The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that's (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later.

A statement from the president of Polyphony Games details that “While 2-player splitscreen races are not supported in VR, all other races, including online races, will be available.” In case you missed it, Resident Evil Village will also get a VR update on launch day.\nThis list of 13 joins the existing lineup of 11 VR games PlayStation announced last November and the six games announced in December. Combined with other previously announced titles, like Horizon: Call of the Mountain, PlayStation VR2 will have over 30 games available to play within a month of launch.\nPlayStation VR2 is set to come out on February 22, just over a month from today. A few months ago, we learned that the base model will cost $549.99, with the option to bundle it with Horizon Call the Mountain for an additional $50.\nFor more on Sony’s new VR headset, check out our hands-on preview from last year, or listen to our reactions to the initial launch details.",

That first Scarlet and Violet expansion arrives this March (alongside various changes, including a price increase), but first, we have one more Sword and Shield expansion to get to.\nPokémon Trading Card Game: Sword & Shield – Crown Zenith, out this week, adds more than 160 new cards, including 3 new Radiant Pokémon, five Pokémon VMax cards, eight Pokémon VStar cards, and 70 cards with special Galarian Gallery artwork. The Pokémon Company sent over some of the products in this special expansion, and we cracked them to see what we could pull.\nThough I'm frustrated you can't buy these as individual booster packs (they're only available in larger packs like the Elite Trainer Box and special collections), I absolutely love several of the cards I pulled. In particular, the full-art cards are absolutely striking. I'm very happy with the Radiant Charizard, and the Pikachu and Lucario cards might be among my favorites of those respective Pokémon. You can see the full gallery below.\n\nPokémon Trading Card Game: Sword & Shield – Crown Zenith arrives starting on January 20 with the Elite Trainer Box and Collections starring Regieleki V or Regidrago V. New Tins and Collections will arrive through May. For all things Pokémon Trading Card Game, head to our special hub by clicking the banner below!",

          "description": "Persona 3 released in North America in 2007 on PlayStation 2 and was a mild hit. The dark, teen drama RPG had a niche audience, but those who found the game adored it. The game received a special edition release with added in content in 2008 with FES, and was then re-released a third time for PSP in 2010 with the most added content, but some modifications made to run on Sony's handheld platform.\nPersona 4 followed – again a mild hit – but then Persona 5 came along and cemented the franchise's reputation as one of the best RPGs ever made. Fans who discovered the series with 5 have wanted to figure out what they've been missing out on, and longtime players have been demanding the re-release of 3 so that a larger audience could play what many call their favorite. After arguably too long, Atlus is finally ready to make that happen with the re-re-re-release of Persona 3 on modern consoles January 19.\nJoin Kyle Hilliard and Wesley LeBlanc as they look at the game's first true dungeon and chat about perhaps the most controversial Persona game in the series.\n\n\nFor more previews of some of the biggest games of 2022 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for NGTs about Vengeful Guardian: Moonrider, Fire Emblem Engage, Clive 'N' Wrench, Inkulinati, Outer Terror, and more.",

          "description": "The Last of Us, the highly anticipated TV adaptation of Naughty Dog's hit game of the same name, finally premiered Sunday and it's looking like a massive hit for HBO. \nThat's because The Last of Us' premiere was the second largest debut for an HBO series since 2010, beaten only by last year's House of the Dragon, the first TV spinoff from HBO's Game of Thrones series. The Last of Us drew in 4.7 million views, according to a Deadline report, coming in second to House of the Dragon's 2022 premiere which pulled in 9.986 million watchers. The Last of Us is matched by HBO's Boardwalk Empire, which premiered in 2010 to 4.81 million viewers. \nDeadline writes that HBO says Sunday night viewing usually represents 20 to 40% of a given show's gross audience per episode (HBO shows typically release episodes on Sunday nights). \n\"We are thrilled to see fans of the series and game alike experience this iconic story in a new way, and we extend our gratitude to them for helping to make it a success,\" CEO and chairman of HBO and HBO Max Content Casey Bloys said, according to Deadline. \"Congratulations to [showrunners Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann, who is also a co-creator of The Last of Us], and the brilliant cast and crew who worked tirelessly to bring this show to life. We look forward to fans around the world enjoying the rest of the season.\" \n\"Our focus was simply to make the best possible adaption of this beloved story for as big an audience as we could,\" Druckmann and Mazin said, according to Deadline. \"We are overjoyed to see how many fans, both old and new, have welcomed The Last of Us into their homes and their hearts.\" \nWhile waiting for this week's episode, read our interview with Druckmann and Joel actor Pedro Pascal about how The Last of Us was changed for TV, and then read about how there are no plans for The Last of Us show to go beyond the games. \n[Source: Deadline]",

For the unfamiliar, GDQ is a 24-hour charity live-stream where dedicated gamers show off speedruns of their favorite games.

Most years have one or two records set, but four is a big deal.\n2023 marks the 14th year that the biannual charity marathon has taken place. They have two main events in the winter and summer, but they also hold smaller events throughout the year. One of these is Frost Fatales, an all-women speedrunning event, which will take place from February 26 - March 4, 2023 on Twitch. Since it was founded in 2010, the organization has raised over $43 million for charity.\nAGDQ was initially set to be in person but was moved online due to COVID concerns. Their summer event, Summer Games Done Quick, will be held from May 28 - June 4, though it's unclear whether the event will also take place in person.\nDid you watch this year's AGDQ?
