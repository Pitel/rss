After all, the pioneering action-survival horror first found its home on a Nintendo platform back in 2005 with the GameCube (and don't you forget it!).\nAlongside the standard trailers and coverage that's been popping up over the past few months, Capcom has just released a new animated short based on the game, and it's... well, it's disturbing. Not overly disturbing in an oh-my-god-I-can't-sleep-at-night-now kind of way, but the cute art style mixed with the blantant violence in the latter portion of the video is certainly unsettling.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

We're talking practical, preventative health tips borne of life experience; things that could have saved us physical discomfort — if not downright pain — and put our now-30-something bodies in better stead for the decades ahead. Tips like 'invest in an electric screwdriver!', for instance. We ended up assembling an enormous amount of IKEA furniture in the last decade or so and would have saved ourselves a lot of time and hand, wrist, and arm strain by shelling out for a decent 18W Black+Decker years ago.\nOne such piece of advice to save our aching back would be to invest in a decent chair for work and play. Enter Herman Miller and Logitech G with their latest gaming offering, the Vantum. Following on from the Embody — the first collaboration between the companies to offer gamers a premium gaming chair (a $1,695 / £1410 premium, no less) — the Vantum is billed as their \"first-ever performance chair made specifically for gamers\".\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

If you buy it from Corsair's US web store, add a PC case like this one and then use code NEWBUILD, you can pick up the laptop and the case for significantly less than the cost of the laptop alone. \nIn fact, this $1800 laptop that debuted in December last year for $2300, complete with Ryzen 9 CPU, 32GB of DDR5 RAM, 2TB of NVMe storage, a 16-in 2560x1600 (16:10) 240Hz display and Radeon RX 6800M graphics card, goes down to just $1536.

          "description": "Layers Of Fear — recently quietly renamed from its working title Layers Of Fears — is a game that requires a bit of explanation. It shares its title with the 2016 game of the same name, and is being overseen by original developers Bloober Team. But it's neither a remake nor a reboot; although, in some ways, it's both of those things. It's more a \"reimagining\" of the whole Layers Of Fear series to date, as well as its apparent swansong. It incorporates ground-up remakes of the two-and-a-half existing games in the series in Unreal Engine 5, alongside a new gaiden chapter complementing the first game, and a brand-new framing narrative tying the whole lot together. \nI recently sat in on an early preview presentation of Layers Of Fear, chatting with creative director Damian Kocurek. Listeners to one very specific episode of the EWS podcast might recall that I'm something of a Layers Of Fear lore theorist, so of course I was delighted to nerd out over what this new(ish) game is all about. Similarly detail-oriented horror fans out there will hopefully share my excitement when I tell them that yes, the rats are back, and you can even catch a brief glimpse of the Rat Queen.\nRead more",

          "description": "In the run-up to its original 2005 release, Capcom was refreshingly - and publicly - clear about their intentions for Resident Evil 4. Feeling that the classic fixed-camera formula that had seen the series thrive during the 90s had grown stale, this follow-up was to be a total reinvention of survival horror as a concept. Something fresh. Dynamic. Exciting. The slate was wiped completely clean, and from that blank canvas, something exceptional was created. A game that not only redefined the franchise, but third-person action games as a whole.\nFor eighteen tumultuous years, Capcom has tried to surpass the success of Resident Evil 4. The fifth and sixth entries doubled down on the action to mixed results, while seven and eight focused on scares as seen from a first-person viewpoint. Meanwhile, 2019’s Resident Evil 2 remake looked to the past for its inspiration, delivering a masterful retread that blended responsive third-person combat with the exquisite production values of the series’ more modern titles. But with the release of Resident Evil 4 remake, Resident Evil has finally come full circle. Whereas the original release was a rejection of the games that came before, this remake is instead a celebration of where the series went next. Action-focused combat. Photo-realistic environments. Gooey monsters, hammy characters, ridiculous storylines. What better way to remake the highest peak of the series, than to build it upon the foundations of the very games it went on to inspire? Resident Evil 4 is a rambunctious thrill ride that is as good - if not, dare I say it, a bit better - than the original game.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Dodgy reseller listings aside, the Steam Deck has spent its entire life thus far without even a temporary price drop. That ends today, as the Steam Spring Sale has launched with the first official Steam Deck savings - a 10% cut across the range - alongside the more expected dealsplosion of discounted games.\nWhat’s more, this sale could also be the last time that the Steam Deck joins in a Steam sale, at least for a very long time. Lawrence Yang, a Valve designer who recently spoke to us about the Deck’s first year in the wild, has also told me that the company are \"looking at this as a one-time deal in celebration of Steam Deck's anniversary.\" You’ll therefore have until March 23rd, when the Spring Sale ends, to seize a saving on the handheld PC before it returns to base pricing – maybe for good.\nAll three Steam Deck versions are part of the sale, shedding exactly 10% apiece. The 64GB model is down from £349 / $399 to £314.10 / $359.10, the 256GB model drops from £459 / $529 to £413.10 / $476.10, and the top 512GB model falls from £569 / $649 to £512.10 / $584.10. Unlike the sad old days of 2022, there’s no lengthy waiting period once you put your order in, though I wouldn’t be surprised if it takes the full two weeks of Valve’s one-to-two week delivery estimate, what with the likely surge in demand.\n Read more",

Since then, the studio have been tight-lipped about their current projects, an “online fantasy RPG” and their mysterious James Bond game - until now. Speaking with Eurogamer, IO co-owners Christian Elverdam and Hakan Abrak shed some light on the Bond project, letting us know that it’s an origin story and that it’ll follow a brand-new 007.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Cut to a couple of weeks after release and I’m having an absolute whale of a time in Endnight Games’ survival horror - and it’s all thanks to sweet, succulent blueberries.\nIt all started when I learned that Sons Of The Forest has a peaceful mode, which completely removes all the gross, yucky cannibals, leaving you to grapple with survival in relative peace and quiet. The first time I met up with Kelvin and we got to work, casually making our shitty shelter and stick storage, I perused the guidebook to see what’s next, and I spotted a planter. A planter? Okay, so I assume you can plant seeds and grow food, then? That’s really co-WAIT, wait, wait. You're telling me this is basically a farming sim?\nRead more",

          "description": "The latest Steam Deck client update has added Valve’s local network game transfers feature – previously only available in beta form – to the Stable branch, marking a full launch for one of the most useful Steam Deck feature upgrades in months.\r\n\n\r\nIf you missed the local transfers beta release last month, know that the name is quite literal: it lets you transfer Steam game installs between your PC and your Steam Deck over a local network, rather than having to re-download them onto every device you own. It also works when transferring between a Steam Deck and another Steam Deck, or between two PCs. Valve have a little explainer here, but it’s simple enough that – for example – hitting the Install button for a game on your Steam Deck will automatically detect if your PC is on the same network, and start transferring as much as it can from the desktop instead of downloading the whole thing from scratch.\r\n\n\r\nYou can even opt into sending/receiving game data from PCs and Steam Decks owned by other people, so long as they’re also connected to the same local network. The biggest benefit seemingly comes to those with monthly data caps (morning, Yanks), as these transfers won’t usually involve any extra downloads. Even so, it’s a helpful addition for anyone on all-you-can-eat data as well, since local transfers are much faster than old fashioned installs. \r\n \nRead more",

Its twists and turns from the get-go have my brain doing mental gymnastics, not just in the game but in trying to figure out how to write around them for this review. I’m not going to spoil everything, but keeping your expectations completley wide open lets Paranormasight snake right on in and surprise you when you least expect it to. \nHere’s a quick elevator pitch: Paranormasight is a Squeenix-developed horror mystery visual novel about deadly rituals, ghost stories, curses, and the occult. Its subversive approach to classic visual novel staples make its puzzles feel smart and its horror scares hit hard. If you’re a fan of the thrills found in the Danganronpa and Zero Escape games, Paranormasight is like a bite-sized version of those two behemoths. It’s short, smart, and will keep you on your toes until the end.\nSo yeah, if that sounds like your thing, then have at it. From here on in, I'm going to be gabbing abut it in-depth.\nRead more",

In this way it seems a lot like my beloved PowerWash Simulator (washing things; time travel).\nThe main thrust of the game I can really get behind - peeling apart big metal ships like clanky onions - but the more literal thrust, i.e. the moving around in zero gravity using a jetpack, is awful.

          "description": "To track the public understanding of modern-day indie gaming is to look at the small-scale independent development scene through an Anglo-centric lens. While it would be unfair to ignore the hobbyists programming experiences in BASIC on their ZX Spectrum or similar, it’s commonly accepted that indie gaming as we recognise it today has its roots in the early days of the internet and the Y2K boom, when Flash, Gamemaker Studio and similar tools allowed things like Cave Story and N to grow. With online distribution further helping games like Bastion, Journey and World Of Goo to flourish, the definition of the indie game became: a title with big ambitions and creativity grown from small budgets and teams.\r\n\n\r\nIt's not entirely wrong, but it has obscured decades of hobby development that was once at the forefront - not just the stories of BBC Micro solo-development stars, but similar ones of hobby development from around the world. In Japan, the doujin markets of Comiket and beyond serve as a home for hobbyists to make, sell and share their creations. It is the doujin gaming scene that helped major studios like Fate/ studio Type-Moon, and franchises like 07th Expansion and Touhou Project, flourish in a way that would never be possible otherwise.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Last week, I was given a preview build of the upcoming first-person zombie-smasher and played about the first five hours of it in single-player, taking in sights like a community of gated millionaire mansions, a slightly less palacious but still ridiculous neighbourhood, and an upmarket hotel styled after the famous Beverly Hills Hotel. They're all full of weird stuff.\nThere's a panic room where a guy turned into a zombie mid-demo tape recording. Actress Emma, who you're battening down the hatches with, has a truly awful full-length Burt Reynoldsian portrait of herself. A shared house called the GOAT PEN, where a team of influencers all live together, has a set for a video series called LIT OR SH!T, and a whiteboard with the script for an apology video. I ask the game director David Stenton if it's low hanging fruit, or if there's no such thing with Hollywood rich people. \"Of course, it's low hanging fruit!\" he says, laughing. \"And also, there's no such thing.\"\nRead more",

Your job is to smash a lot of them to pieces with a hammer, like so many sausages and balloons full of blood held together by sellotape.

          "description": "Until recently, the story of Intel’s Arc GPUs has been a litany of mild disappointments. After years of it being easier to buy an original O’Keefe than a reasonably priced graphics card, the Arc series brought hope that it might actually be possible to get a decent PC upgrade for less than £500. Then they were repeatedly delayed, confirmed to possess some unwelcome technical quirks (like wanting Resizable BAR on at all times), and ultimately released with merely decent-ish performance. Nothing awful, but nowhere near as special as they once seemed like they could be.\nIn 2023, however, Intel Arc may be on a redemption... arc. A series of driver updates, Intel claims, have improved average FPS performance by up to 87% since launch, with major gains in frame times (the time between each new rendered frame) as well. The specific model we have here, the Arc A750 Limited Edition, has also had its price cut from £330 / $289 to  £250 / $250. More power for less money? I’d say that’s worth a fresh evaluation.\nRead more",

Yesterday’s patch added a mid-game boss, a bucket of balance tweaks, multiple fixes for everyone’s absolute best friend Kelvin, plus much more.

I have no idea how old they are supposed to be and for some reason that’s not surprising.) survivors and a stalwart detective revisit the ruins of a hospital that was once home to a haunting ceremony. They all have amnesia, of course, because that’s a low-effort way to generate an air of mystery. Well, except the detective, who is just confused because he never really figured out what was going on in the first place. \nOverall, it’s a thoroughly okay game from 2008 that’s been papered over with some hazy lofi graphics to justify selling it at full price in 2023. It’s up to you if you think that’s worth it – I bought the Mass Effect remaster, so I’m hardly one to judge – but while the graphics have been thoroughly airbrushed, that’s no cure for Fatal Frame’s dated gameplay and undead pacing. \nRead more",

Bedtime Studios’ follow-up Figment 2: Creed Valley keeps very close to the beat of the first one. You don’t need to have played Figment 1 to enjoy this sequel, but I almost feel like you’d be missing you if you didn’t (especially as it’s free on Steam right now, for today only).\nFigment 2 has all the visual flair and catchy sing-songs of the first, but it feels weirdly smaller. Both games will run you about 5 hours each, but Figment 2 is a little less punchy, a little less diverse, and feels more like an encore rather than a dazzling comeback album. That’s not necessarily bad; I love an encore, and I enjoyed seeing more of Figment's surreal, subconscious mind-world. But, yeah, it’s very much the same as the first game, but with less scope and fewer fart clouds.\nRead more",

And that's coming from someone who recently reviewed Team Ninja's Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, a game that's mighty good at grinding people into paste. I'm not trying brag; I'm being vulnerable with you. I have a case of the Ben Affleck blues, where most sessions of Clash's third-person action-adventuring have me veering from elation to being slumped against a wall with Affleck's signature grimace on my face.\nAside from being really difficult, I'm a bit undecided on how I feel about Clash in the portions I've played so far. It looks fantastic and puts some brilliant spins on combat, but levelling is a bore and exploration has a confusing edge. It's at once both a grand time and an annoying one. The surreal lands of Zenozoik, it turns out, aren't all sunshine and turkey men. There are a lot of turkey men, though.\nRead more",

That's because the SSD offers excellent performance while working within the confines of the SATA interface, with straightforward TLC NAND flash and a DRAM-equipped design that ensures strong sustained performance - something lacking in QLC DRAM-less designs. \nToday, the Crucial MX500 in its 2TB capacity is down to $102.99 at Amazon US, making it nearly 50% off its MSRP and the lowest price we've ever recorded. \nRead more",

Although it was announced as part of a promo event for AMD’s Radeon RX 7000 GPUs, Infinite’s ray tracing works on any graphics card that can usually handle RT effects; all you need to do is download the update and flick it on in the display settings.\nGranted, it’s not the most visually sumptuous form of ray tracing I’ve clapped a visor on. Reflections and global illumination are unchanged, as it’s only sun shadows – shadows cast using a simulated sun as the light source – that get the RT treatment.\nRead more",

It works out incredibly well for our young hero, as you can imagine. But why waste your time reading about it when you could simply be watching it. Are you sitting comfortably?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lppo5cNxrhk&ab_channel=capcomasia\nIt would be a safe assumption that we will see other anime shorts during the Resident Evil 4 launch period, and nobody would blame you for having the strange feeling that we've been here before. In one of the best marketing campaigns in gaming history, Capcom supported the launch of 2021's Resident Evil Village with a delightful series of shorts featuring puppet variations of that game's main villains. (And boy, I really miss those puppets). Clearly, Capcom has decided that the \"creepy cute\" aesthetic is the way to go when it comes to promoting its flagship survival horror franchise.\nWe'll be sure to post all of the Leon and the Mysterious Village episodes here on Destructoid as they premiere. Resident Evil 4 launches March 24 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.\nThe post Capcom debuts bizarre-but-cute Resident Evil 4 anime series appeared first on Destructoid.",

Flash forward nearly 16 years later, and most of the enduring, popular new intellectual properties since then haven't come AAA at all, and instead hail from what you might call \"B budget\" developers. Human Fall Flat, Five Nights at Freddy's, Genshin Impact, Among Us, Fall Guys, Fortnite, Vampire Survivors, and Rocket League are just a few of the non-AAA games that went on to find big, sustained audiences since then.\nThe list of games like this to both launch well and continue to perform well is a lot longer than the list of new, multi-million-dollar, AAA franchises that achieve the same goals in a similar timefr…",

Devised as Namco's answer to Sega's hugely successful Space Harrier, Thunder Ceptor II features similar gameplay, (though nowhere near as fast), although it does include a rudimentary HUD, offering up information such as weapon selection and enemy position.\nCheck out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber Replay Burners.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeTC9pVdt44&ab_channel=ReplayBurners\nIn the arcades, 3D Thunder Ceptor II turned heads due to its groundbreaking use of stereoscopic 3D. The cabinet itself utilized a variety of layered windows in order to create false depth, making the enemies seemingly leap off the screen and toward the player. While the game itself wasn't widespread, its utilization of 3D technology was praised, with other developers following with their own 3D titles in the following years, including Namco's own Starblade. Of course, it goes without saying that the Arcade Archives release does not include 3D support, kind of removing a key element of game's concept.\n3D Thunder Ceptor II is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.\nThe post 3D Thunder Ceptor II comin’ atcha in the Arcade Archives appeared first on Destructoid.",

Nitrome and Yacht Club Games have announced a free DLC update for Shovel Knight Dig dubbed \"Fate and Fortune,\" out now for PC and Apple Arcade, arriving later on console.\nThe Fame and Fortune DLC brings Black Knight into the fray. The shadowy dark knight teams up with Shovel Knight to help uncover the true Knightmare, unlocking Knightmare Mode once players have completed the base game.\nThis mode is a special challenge, where each stage will introduce new challenges. Enemies could hit harder, resources may become scarce, or the stage may even get longer. Each one stacks too, so expect some exponential escalation of difficulty.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PL9-Rorp3k\nIt's not all doom and gloom, though. A new pal Fetcher is also here, who will be waiting at the end of each stage. For a price, he'll give you a chance to exit the well mid-run, saving your gold and returning the Knight to the Hub.\nPlus, there are some Mementos awarded to players for their accomplishments, with which they can decorate the Hub. Add in a new Compendium, new music track, and some quality-of-life adjustments, and it's a pretty solid update. Additionally, the crew notes on the announcement page that more free DLC is planned for Shovel Knight Dig.\nHeading down the well\nShovel Knight Dig was one of several Shovel Knight spin-offs to arrive over the last few years. And with both Dig and Pocket Dungeon, it's been interesting to see Yacht Club Games let others take a stab at the franchise and see what results come up.\nWhile Yacht Club works away at Mina the Hollower, this new Dig update seems like a good way for eager spelunkers to dive back into the world of Dig. The update is out now on PC and mobile, and will arrive at a later date for consoles. And if you're eager to pick it up now, it's on sale on Steam right now for 40% off.\nThe post Shovel Knight Dig gets free Fate and Fortune DLC appeared first on Destructoid.",

Beyond the fact that it will be coming to PC via Steam, no release window has been given.\nCorpoNation: The Sorting Process casts you in the role of a new employee of Ringo CorpoNation, where you must sort their genetic samples. It’s being billed as a “linear dystopian narrative,” and features tactile desk-based gameplay. Despite being a linear narrative, you’re able to customize your room and unwind after work to make your existence feel less meaningless and empty. You can also chat with your co-workers about the latest conspiracies. Check out more in this appropriately creepy trailer.\nhttps://youtu.be/_PLdIVrJNV4\nThis is probably one of my favorite genres to spring up in the last decade. Following the way-too-depressing-for-me hit, Paper’s Please, smaller developers seem to have caught on that there is a lot of satisfaction when it comes to desktop busywork. The fact that you can enjoy the satisfaction of a job well done, and be rewarded with tangible progression, and not have to spend 40 hours a week doing it is enough to strip out all the soul-sucking parts and leave pure bliss.\nOn the other hand, CorpoNation: The Sorting Process looks like it’s going to be a small project. Its linear narrative and overt themes leave little room to really get transcendental, but that doesn’t mean it’s not going to be a fun and interesting experience.

Deck tinkerers quickly discovered, though, that you could go into the files of the Steam Deck and alter what played for the start-up.\nOriginally, Valve acknowledged this with a little Beta update, expanding the possible maximum length of boot videos from 10 to 30 seconds. But in a new update, Valve is making that functionality official.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELtzcpb_j38\nThe Steam Deck manufacturer is also putting up some startup movie options of its own. You can find the new items in the Points Shop over here. There's everything from a Turret Factory to papercraft and a flashing, form-changing one that feels reminiscent of Everything Everywhere All At Once.\nAll hands on Deck\nAdditionally, as part of the birthday festivities, the Steam Deck is currently 10% off. This sale will last through the duration of the currently ongoing Steam Spring Sale, up until March 23 at 10 a.m. PT.

Over on this site, you can play Banshees: The Game, a pixel-y game based on the Academy Award-nominated film.\nCreated by Cogs & Marvel, this little retro-style game does indeed take after The Banshees of Inisherin. It's got some lovely pixel work, including great illustrations of Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson.\nHow exactly does it play? Well, it's basically Pac-Man. And that leads me to my first big point: for full disclosure, I have not seen this film. I'm only vaguely aware of The Banshees of Inisherin, mostly in that it stars Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson, is a bit of a dark comedy, and is set on a fictional Irish isle. It's also, as I've learned in the course of writing this article, from the same star pairing and director (Martin McDonagh) that created In Bruges, which has certainly piqued my interest.\nThat unfamiliarity did not help when I found that this video game is essentially Pac-Man, but with Brendan Gleeson's character steadily picking up fingers before heading to the pub. Certainly a far cry from little dots and cherries.\n[caption id=\"attachment_369326\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot by Destructoid[/caption]\nYeah, I've got no clue. Now, at this juncture, I must assume that The Banshees of Inisherin is about Brendan Gleeson desperately trying to reclaim the fingers he needs to hold his pint at the pub, before Colin Farrell catches up to him.\nAs deeply relatable as that sentiment is, I'm sure folks who have actually seen and enjoyed this award-nominated film find some dark humor in this set-up. It's certainly made me curious what it's all about. And really, a Pac-Man clone where you pick up fingers isn't even close to scraping the depths of movie-to-game adaptations. You can play Banshees: The Game yourself here.\nThe post The Banshees of Inisherin gets transformed into a retro browser game appeared first on Destructoid.",

Additionally, Chess Ultra supports 4K resolution, as well as VR through Oculus and HTC Vive.\nhttps://youtu.be/FrONtYp6Pic\nAlongside Chess Ultra, the new Epic Games Store update will also offer up free DLC for the long-running strategy title World of Warships. The World of Warships — Starter Pack: Ishizuchi features the titular Tier IV battleship, as well as 11 Epic camouflage patterns, five award containers, and a variety of in-game boosters and currency packs. The DLC usually retails for around $20, so if you're a WoW fan, be sure to jump on this bargain while you are able.\nChess Ultra and WoW: Ishizuchi will be available to download free from Epic Games Store from March 16-23. Until then, you still have time to pick up Warhammer 40,000: Gladius – Relics of War.\nThe post Chess Ultra leads next week’s Epic Game Store freebies appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Bow to the King\nThere are many great characters in the Tekken series, but few as recognizable as King. The jaguar-masked wrestler has been a staple of Tekken since the series' beginning, delivering high-flying, devastating destruction. And King is looking absolutely fantastic in the latest Tekken 8 gameplay trailer.\nBandai Namco has been gradually spotlight each Tekken 8 combatant with a gameplay trailer of their own, and King is the newest one in the arena. What more do I need to say? It's King. He's got powerful punches, leaping kicks, and chain combos with grapples that seem like they do some real, real damage. I spied a taunt of some kind as well, with King baring his chest, daring the opponent to take a swing and find out what happens. The result? Not good for them.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OII3DNh4iaE\nThere's something electric about the way King plays that's just fun to watch. I'm normally not a grappler player, but King feels a bit more acrobatic than his throw-happy counterparts in games like Guilty Gear or Street Fighter. In the trailer, we can see the new Paul, with much less hair product than usual, getting absolutely demolished by King's knee. It's fantastic.\nWhether it's talking it up on the mic or delivering devastating destruction, King always brings it. If there's one constant in Tekken, as even characters like Jin start to change and adapt for Story Purposes, I'm glad it's King.\nTekken 8 is currently in development for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. No firm release date or window's been locked in yet.\nRelated: All Characters Confirmed for Tekken 8 on PrimaGames\nThe post King brings the pain in new Tekken 8 gameplay trailer appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Banned from the NBA\nRed Wing Shoes have shown off their pair of replica kicks made in celebration of the upcoming Super Mario Bros. Movie. Unfortunately, they’re not selling them.\nThe company shows the creation process in a video that would be effective ASMR if they didn’t underline it with dramatic music. With painstaking stitching, a bit of hammering, and some good old-fashioned glue, they put a bunch of dead cows together to create the sort of shoes that kids get made fun of for wearing at school. The shoes appear to be officially sanctioned by Nintendo, but if not, this company is very excited about the Super Mario Bros. Movie.\nhttps://youtu.be/YAm8GK47cDw\nOnce again, the caveat here is that you cannot buy these shoes, not in the usual shoe sense where they were all bought up by scalpers and are being resold for a few jillion dollars, but in the literal sense where they’re simply not up for sale. This is possibly because the Mario games have shown that they are deadly weapons capable of crushing anything without a hard shell.\nNot that I would personally want to. They have laces. No one has time for laces. Do kids even know how to tie laces anymore? Kids these days…\nOn the other hand, this is great advertising for Red Wing Shoes.  I had never heard of them, but there are some nice boots here! This may surprise you, but video game people like myself don't have much need for a practical pair of work boots. I do stub my toe sometimes, but not enough that I need some safety-toed boots to wear at my desk.\nThe post Red Wing Shoes made a real pair of Mario clodhoppers, but you can’t have them appeared first on Destructoid.",

While LCD displays have largely led to a major decline in light gun games, House of the Gundead uses a pair of shiny Shinden light guns for allegedly pixel-perfect aiming. It also has some absolutely fab cabinetry, with great artwork and a big, big 43” screen.\nNot only that, but the game itself looks fun. Drawing from the cute, cartoony style of Enter the Gungeon, it’s a far cry from your usual Time Crisis. I’m honestly having difficulty saying more about it because I’m taken in by its visuals.\nI really want to play it. It’s too bad arcades are a myth.\n[embed]https://youtu.be/N1R4eVLxTP4[/embed]\nI’m hoping House of the Gundead gets ported eventually. I recently put money down on a Sinden light gun because if it does what it says on the box – and I have no reason to believe it doesn’t – then it’s an exciting prospect. I’m not a gun person by any means, but I love the physicality of the experience. At least I can afford one of those. I’m not sure where I’d put an arcade cab in my postage-stamp-sized apartment, but if Devolver would like to send me one for review (wink wink), I would be willing to throw my husband out to make space.\nHouse of the Gundead is available for order right now in arcade cabinet format only.\nThe post Can someone lend me $5500 to buy this House of the Gundead arcade cabinet? appeared first on Destructoid.",

Mechanics that were refined in the title, such as the aiming and over-the-shoulder camera, became widespread in the console generation that followed. QTE events caught on in a big way, and set-piece moments became focal points in many big titles. Some of the best and worst parts of modern game design were first popularized in the 2005 title. As meandering and unfocused as it could be, it's an important and well-loved title.\nWhen the Resident Evil 4 remake was announced, like many people, I wondered how Capcom would approach the most over-the-top and ridiculous elements that seem so out-of-place in the drab, monotonous high-budget market.

I know y'all can’t sleep until we report whether the newest 7-Star Raid Pokemon can breed or not, and I’m here to deliver you the good news. Decidueye can, in fact, lay eggs. Here’s what you need to do.\n[caption id=\"attachment_369210\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot by Destructoid[/caption]\nBring Decidueye and Ditto to a picnic\nJust like with Greninja and Cinderace, you can get a Rowlet egg by bringing Decidueye and Ditto to a picnic. For best results, remove all other Pokemon from your party to ensure Rowlet will appear as an egg. This effectively circumvents the “only one Decidueye can be caught per save file” rule of the 7-Star raid, though baby Rowlet won’t have the Mightiest Mark title. Use this trick to hook your friends up with Decidueye if they miss the event!\nFor more information, check out our guide to find Ditto here. We also have a detailed guide on egg hatching here. If you plan to hatch a lot of eggs, consider getting a Pokemon with the Flame Body ability as well. I've maybe written too much about this video game.\n[caption id=\"attachment_369211\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot by Destructoid[/caption]\nIn Pokemon Scarlet & Violet, Rowlet still evolves into Dartrix at level 17, and Decidueye at level 34\nAs always, all you need to evolve your Rowlet is good old level grinding. For best results, use your EXP candies on Rowlet to level it up fast. If you’ve run the 7-Star Decidueye Raid, there’s a good chance you have more than a few EXP items to spare.\nThis has been your Tim “The Poké-man” Monbleau PSA of the day.

          "description": "That planet is cracked\nDying Light studio Techland has published a teaser for its next project. Though still unnamed, the new fantasy title got a slice of concept art today.\nOn Twitter, Techland shared the art of its newest game. It's set to be a narrative-driven fantasy epic, with an \"exotic open world\" to explore.\n\"We strive to create a compelling story-focused AAA title that combines and refines the best aspects of gameplay that Techland is known for,\" reads the post.\nhttps://twitter.com/TechlandGames/status/1636378215550976001\nWhat can we see? Well, we've got a man holding onto a tree, observing a far-off city. There's some wildlife about, and some waterfalls, and off in the distance is a big, cracked planet. Not too much to go on for now other than vibes, though vibes seem squarely set in the sci-fi fantasy realm. And given Techland's proclivity for movement in the Dying Light series, probably some free-running at some point.\nSweet, sweet fantasy\nIt's interesting to see Techland turn to fantasy, after doing so much work in the zombie genre. But I do like the idea of some of that parkour-centric development bleeding over into a more out-there world. It reminds me of the new project from IO Interactive, where the team over there is also working on its own fantasy title.\nTechland had teased an open-world fantasy game with RPG elements back in 2016, though it clarified that it has RPG elements, but is not an RPG game. Whatever the case may be, I'm definitely interested in seeing what Techland has been cooking up for its fantasy project.\nThe post Techland shares a teaser of its upcoming ‘story-focused AAA title’ appeared first on Destructoid.",

Of course, you're probably wondering whether or not it's worth the full $60 price point. Well, we have a review for that! Some of you may want to wait for a price drop, but others will have a pretty good time diving into this storybook adventure.\nHave a Nice Death is also worth a look, and has been in Early Access on PC for a bit. It deals with a business-oriented put-upon cartoon version of Death, who needs to \"restore order\" with the help of Death Inc and his associates. Both of these are in addition to...well...a ton of other games coming to the eShop this week (vaguely gestures to the bottom of this article).\nOf those, Unmatched: Digital E…",

His movie credits include the \"John Wick\" franchise (he was promoting the latest, \"John Wick 4,\" which hits theaters soon, just this week), \"Godzilla Vs.

Now, he's branching out into something he's never done before: mobile game ads. Following in the footsteps of actress Kathy Bates, Pascal has recently appeared in a series of promotional shorts for a mobile game called Merge Mansion, and Game Informer can exclusively reveal the latest installment. Check it out below:\n\n\nIn this series, Pascal plays a detective named Tim Rockford, who's trying to figure out what exactly is going on with the mysterious grandma in Merge Mansion. It's an enigma so elusive that he never even says exactly what he is he's investigating, though from the collection of knives he has in his evidence room, it seems an act of violence was committed.\nIn a press release, Pascal had the following to say about this role.\nWhat exactly is Tim Rockford investigating? What is grandma putting in her pies? Will Pedro Pascal become a playable character in-game? You'll have to play Merge Mansion, available on iOS and Android devices, to find out.\nWhich extremely high-profile actor do you think will appear in a Merge Mansion ad next?

Strayed Lights continues to look great visually, and the action looks awesome. \nCheck it out for yourself in the new Strayed Lights gameplay trailer below: \n\n\n\"In Strayed Lights, you travel through otherworldly regions of misty woods, glowing ruins, and corrupted cities while pursued by eerie shadow creatures,\" a press release reads. \"You also take on boss fights with colossal creatures wrought with unbridled emotion. Your tiny light will grow, picking up new abilities and increasing in size, before eventually evolving into a pseudo-mystical entity imbued with vivid powers. \n\"Meanwhile, you'll get a glimpse at the mysteries of the surrounding world, whether through other strayed lights like yourself, or different creatures entirely. The game is set to an atmospheric soundtrack that reflects states of feeling in creatures you encounter, by Grammy-award-winning composer Austin Wintory – whose previous projects include Journey, Abzu, and The Banner Saga Series.\" \nAs for the new Steam demo, Embers calls it a \"limited time\" experience so if you're interested in checking the game out, do it as soon as you can because there's no word on when the demo will no longer be available. \n\n\"We are thrilled to be able to share our new gameplay trailer and demo with fans of Strayed Lights,\" Embers co-founder and creative director Alexandre Arramon writes in a press release. \"We've been working hard to create a game that is both engaging and visually outstanding, and we can't wait for players to experience it for themselves.\" \nStrayed Lights hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on April 25. \nAre you going to check out the Strayed Lights demo?

          "description": "Last November, Game Freak released Pokémon Scarlet and Violet on Switch. The game quickly became one of the top-selling games in the history of the popular console, and now, it's time for the new generation to kick off within the popular Pokémon Trading Card Game. The inaugural Pokémon Scarlet & Violet expansion does more than just introduce the ninth generation of Pokémon into the TCG; it also implements a whole host of changes, not the least of which is a higher price tag for most items. \nHowever, along with that price increase come several benefits, including a new guarantee of three foil cards in every booster pack, plus the introduction of the silver border in the U.S. and other quality-of-life improvements with regards to the designs. The Pokémon Company sent over several booster packs for us to crack open and see what we could pull. While I was less frequently blown away by the big cards I pulled, this is one of the most robust galleries of \"the coolest cards\" articles I've done in a great many expansions. Partially, that is due to me enjoying seeing some of the newer Pokémon from Gen IX getting their first cards, but I can't help but think the increase in foil cards was to thank.\nIn total, the Pokémon Scarlet & Violet expansion introduces more than 190 new cards, including more than 10 new Pokémon ex cards, more than 30 Trainer cards, new Tera Pokémon, and tons of special-illustration Pokémon and Trainer cards. You can see the coolest cards we pulled from this expansion in the gallery below:\n\n Pokémon Trading Card Game: Scarlet & Violet is available starting on March 31.

The developer made the announcement on its Kickstarter page, writing, \n“Since the very beginning, we were secretly hoping to be able to cover all current and previous generation consoles. With production being a world of curve balls, we had to leave the messaging at 'PC and Consoles' to avoid having to walk some things back.

Atari simply says it has acquired a \"dozen retro arcade games\" so it's likely the other 10 properties are from the same era of arcade games as Berzerk and Frenzy. \n\"Atari...announced today the acquisition of a dozen retro arcade games, including the '80s classics Berzerk and Frenzy,\" the press release reads. \"Atari will seek to expand digital and physical distribution of the classic titles, create new games based on the IPs, and explore brand and merchandising collaborations.\"\nAtari says Berzerk is \"a top-down, multidirectional shooter designed by Alan McNeil that was released for arcades in 1980.\" It's perhaps best known for being the first arcade video game with speech synthesis. Following its arcade release, Berzerk was ported to the Atari 2600 and Atari 5200 by the console maker. Frenzy is actually a sequel to Berzerk first released in 1982. \n\"Berzerk is one of those foundational games that so many people first encountered playing on an Atari console,\" Atari CEO Wade Rosen writes in the press release. \"Berzerk, and the other titles included in this acquisition, are a perfect fit for our strategy of commercializing classic retro IP.\"\nWho knows if we'll learn what the other 10 retro arcade properties Atari has acquired are – only time will tell.

The game will launch with all of its DLC on PlayStation, including Episode 1: Flux, Episode 2: Refuge, and the upcoming Episode 3: Purge. \nI reviewed Citizen Sleeper last year, giving it a 9 out of 10 and calling it a Game Informer Must Play game. You can find out why in my review here. It was also in Game Informer's top 10 games of 2022, and you can read about where we placed it here. \nAre you going to play Citizen Sleeper on PlayStation?

The reimagined classic arrives on May 30.\nFor those keeping score, this announcement also acts as another delay, as System Shock had been scheduled to release this month. The game will be available first on Steam, The Epic Store, and GOG for $39.99, while the PlayStation and Xbox versions will release at an unspecified later date. \nSystem Shock has been in the works in some form since at least 2016, beginning life as a crowd-funded passion project that aims to revitalize the 1994 classic. The remake overhauls the adventure with modernized graphics and controls, a redesigned UI, and more, but the villainous A.I. SHODAN is still voiced by her original performer.\nAre you planning to play System Shock? Let us know in the comments!

Presumably, people have been speculating that the game might come to Game Pass as Blizzard Entertainment and Xbox are close to teaming up by way of Microsoft's pending acquisition of Activision Blizzard. \nIt's awesome seeing the excitement around the Diablo IV Beta, and our Wolf Pack puppy! We’ve been getting some questions about D4 on Game Pass and I want to let you know we have no plans for that. See you in Sanctuary during the Beta Early Access weekend starting on March 17!\nMarch 13, 2023\nAs you can see in Fergusson's tweet above, there's no plans for Diablo IV to come to Game Pass. But Diablo IV is out June 6; perhaps there's time for plans to change (although I'm not betting on it, personally). \nIn the meantime, if you preorder the game, you can hop into a closed beta starting tomorrow, March 17. That closed period runs until March 19 and then starting March 24, there will be an open beta that anyone can jump into. It runs until March 26. \nWhile waiting for these betas, read Game Informer's exclusive guided tour through Diablo IV's Sanctuary. \n[Source: Video Games Chronicle]\nAre you hopping into one of Diablo IV's betas?

The game puts you in the metallic shoes of Alex Murphy as you explore Detroit in what appears to be a high-octane, technologically advanced first-person shooter.\nRoboCop: Rogue City not only gives you the tech-enhanced combat capabilities of the eponymous protagonist but also gives you the ability to make dialogue choices as you meet new characters. This lets you decide how to fulfill your objectives, but as you might have guessed, the developers intend to throw various twists in a story about corruption and greed. Actor Peter Weller, who portrayed Murphy in the original films, is scheduled to reprise his role in the game.\nYou can see the action unfold for yourself below.\n\n\nDeveloper Teyon was founded in 2006 and has released nearly 100 games since. Its most noteworthy releases include other licensed titles starring '80s action IP, including 2014's Rambo: The Video Game and 2019's Terminator: Resistance. RoboCop: Rogue City arrives in September for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

          "description": "As part of our Resident Evil 4 cover story last month, we showed off a slice of Chapter 5 gameplay in which some fans called out the heavy rain effects for being too intense and distracting. Capcom has heard those complaints and plans on changing the rain to make it more palatable. \nIn an interview with Press Start Australia (thanks IGN), the outlet asked RE4 producer Hirabayashi Yoshiaki if the team was aware of the negative response to the rain, and he had this to say: \n“We’ve seen everyone’s reaction to the rain effects, and we are working on a day-one patch to make adjustments”\nSo there it is. It looks like “raingate” will soon be a thing of the past, and it’s nice that Capcom recognized the complaints ahead of Resident Evil 4’s release.  \nResident Evil 4 launches on March 24 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC.

He reiterates that Starfield is a unique experience that also has many of the hallmarks fans expect from a Bethesda title.

The main story unfolds across three interconnected campaigns set on land, the sea, and the sky and features a new cast of commanders. It also features a new roguelike campaign called Conquest that tasks players to complete a series of smaller battles while making permanent choices and relying on the same pool of units, health, and resources. \n\n\nWargroove 2 features four-player co-op and versus battles (local and online) along with rule customization and asynchronous play. An in-game editor allows players to create custom maps, campaigns, and even cutscenes to share with other players. \nThe first Wargroove was lauded as a fun throwback to Advance Wars when it launched in 2019, so we’re excited to see what Chucklefish has in store for the follow-up. Wargroove 2 doesn’t have a release window, but it’s slated to launch on Switch and PC. You can read out review of the first game here.",

Their revolution will shatter Damcai's deceptive peace – a peace built with the blood and sweat of mages. The Mageseeker provides an action-packed fantasy gameplay experience for those looking to experience a story of power, identity, and justice.\" \nRiot Games also revealed today that it is selling a physical Collector's Edition of the game for $169.99. It includes a Sylas statue, an art book, a deluxe art print, the Lux Comic (special edition hardcover), Sylas & Lux enamel pins, and a vinyl soundtrack. All of this comes housed within an exclusive custom box. \n\nThe Mageseeker follows the release of 2021's League of Legends Story game, Ruined King.
