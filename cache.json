The stylish rhythm game, clad in the smoky browns and oranges of the era, has finally got a release date: March 3rd, 2022.\nA Musical Story is a groovy tale about a young man exploring his memories through music, with an original 26-song soundtrack that slowly unwinds his story — as long as you get the rhythm sections right, baby.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Not Melody of Memory, that's a half-measure. We wanted the full shebang, 1.5 + 2.5 ReMix. And now we've got it... in the most cursed form possible, a Cloud Version.\nDon't worry, we're not going to spend the whole review complaining about this means of delivery, though we probably could. Let's just take the drawbacks as read; an unstable or weaker internet connection will hamper performance (stuttering, hitching and freezing), introduce significant input lag or, worst of all, simply kick you back to the menu, potentially losing extensive progress. This is far from an ideal way to play Kingdom Hearts, and in truth, we don't understand why 1.5 + 2.5 ReMix couldn't simply have been ported to a system that could plainly handle it. Square Enix certainly has the resources, and it's incredibly disappointing for fans of this series to see that the company simply wasn't willing to invest the time, effort and funds to make a native port a reality.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

There's little doubt that meeting 2022 expectations around visuals and performance will be a challenge for the system, but an interesting license related to the upcoming Nintendo Switch Sports points to a potential avenue for Nintendo to maximise the hybrid's capabilities.\nAs spotted by @NWPlayer123 in the test version download of Nintendo Switch Sports, the game is utilising a license for AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution technology. This is actually open source and free to use, but monetised projects still need to acknowledge its use in license pages like those below. Right now Nintendo seems to be just utilising it in this particular game, but if the results are good it's not inconceivable that it could be used in other projects.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Possibly one of the most important losses.\nThe upcoming closure of the Wii U and 3DS eShop for new purchases and downloads has been notable news today, with plenty pointing out various download-only or DLC classics that will be lost when the stores close. You will be able to redownload content you already own for the foreseeable future, but you won't be able to add funds on either store from 23rd May 2022, while purchases will fully end at the close of March 2023.\nOne particularly notable loss, in a major Nintendo IP no less, will be Fire Emblem Fates: Revelation. Much like the more recent Fire Emblem: Three Houses, Fates had multiple campaigns to dive into - Birthright, Conquest and Revelation. The first two saw you take different sides at a key point in the story, and each had differences in difficulty and the sorts of missions you faced. The structure of how you bought the campaigns was interesting too, with a Pokemon-style approach of a dual pack or individual retail versions for Birthright and Conquest.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

On one hand, this isn't all that shocking; it's perhaps naive to expect Nintendo to keep digital storefronts alive on platforms that are no longer its main focus, but on the other hand, the Japanese giant just sent hacker Gary Bowser to jail for three years for enabling piracy on its Switch console – as well as getting him to cough up $4.5 million to Nintendo of America as restitution, and a further $10 million as \"monetary relief\".\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Freud would be proud.\nNot even a year ago, FuRyu revealed a curious new game called Monark that was heavily marketed as being the lovechild of several ex-Atlus staff who were instrumental in the early days of the Shin Megami Tensei and Persona series. Monark has certainly managed to deliver on that promise, as this is a title that retains the dark vibe and somewhat philosophical focus of those older titles, while bringing in some interesting new ideas that help it to stand on its own. It's definitely rough around the edges, but we think this is still worth giving a fair look.\nMonark cuts right to the chase in getting its story going, skipping any semblance of exposition or setup in favor of just tossing you in and letting you figure things out as you go. You’re placed in the role of an amnesiac high school student who wakes up in Shin Mikado Academy, an institution that seems to be struggling with a paranormal problem. Nobody can leave and most parts of the school have been overrun by a mysterious mist, which slowly causes madness if anyone spends too long breathing it in. The few survivors have barricaded themselves into the few remaining safe places, while the ever-encroaching mist threatens to waft in from all sides.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Core Design managed the same thing with the original Tomb Raider back in 1996, too. Nobody really talks about it now, while the Mario story endures. Possibly because Nintendo didn’t make umpteen identikit sequels over the following decade or splash Mario’s stretchy mug on the cover of The Face. \nReally though, the Italian plumber and English graverobber were equally confident that if all their moves were available right from the start with no unlocking needed then that was enough. Both games were – are still, after a quarter of a century – the Platonic ideal of their characters. And they had bloody good swimming sections. \nRead more",

          "description": "Skateboarding sim Session has added a lot in the past two years, but also lost some of its ragdoll charm. Since last year's total physics overhaul, you no longer bail with every failed trick, instead teleporting off your board in a strange, stiff way that saves time but (for me at least) replaces one unrealistic motion with another, less funny one. I want to get that gripe out of the way, because otherwise it's still gunning to be the sim for darksliding anoraks. \nThe next update will add two new areas, which I got to try out recently, and some new pro skater faces. If you can ignore the frequent wacky physics hiccups and the rigid, nonplussed reaction your character has when they should, by all rights, be landing flat on their face, you'll find a surprisingly chill skating game. It's less about hoarding points with as many tricks as possible and more about pushing languidly around a city as viewed through a seasoned kickflipper's fisheye goggles. \nRead more",

To both my relief and, I think, the relief of the Carpet Man, it wasn't grey. The shade that, for whatever reason, most people like to walk on.

          "description": "Baldur’s Gate’s most famous barbarian wasn’t actually a barbarian at all. Technically speaking, Minsc was a ranger - a man of the woods who just happened to spin into a rage during battle, hitting friend or foe for extra damage, while ignoring blows that would fell a tree. It was a classification that came with its benefits: since every ranger was entitled to an animal companion, Minsc had justification for his connection to Boo, the “miniature giant space hamster” that lived in his inventory. But the primary reason for the misnomer was a gap in the rules of Dungeons & Dragons.\r\n\n\r\n“Second edition didn’t have the barbarian class,” remembers lead designer James Ohlen. “Baldur’s Gate 2 used third edition classes, but by then, it was too late.”\r\n\n\r\nLarian Studios, the current custodians of the series, don’t have any such issues. Working with D&D’s fifth edition, which has full and flavoursome rules that allow players to embody barbarians, the developers have adapted the class for use in Baldur’s Gate III. It’s a typically meticulous transposition that holds true to the tabletop game’s definition of what makes a barbarian boil: “More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea.”\r\n\n \nRead more",

In virtual reality, Demeo seeks to recreate the feeling of playing a TRPG strategy game, huddled around a table with three pals and a load of cheesey crisps. Soon, though, you won't need a headset to play it, as Demeo is also getting a standalone PC version. I got invited for a little hands-on of the PC build, and thought that since I am a tabletop-game-playing person, it'd be interesting to bring Ed along with me. Ed likes multiplayer PC games more than me, but in the kind of kill-streak, headshot, battle-royale way. Thus, as a team, we are perfectly poised to assess how Demeo stacks up as a co-op PC game.\nWe played a single level in Demeo's first adventure module, The Black Sarcophagus, although when it launches in early access a complete game will stretch to three. Demeo will also have all the other adventures released for the VR version, including the most recent forest-set Roots Of Evil, but The Black Sarcophagus placed us in a creepy stone dungeon and/or crypt. The goal was to find the monster carrying the crypt key, remove the key by force, and then unlock door to the next level. Our team of four was completed by Tommy Palm, CEO and founder of Resolution games (and owner of a truly top-tier cardigan) and producer Gustav Stenmark (no cardigan visible sadly, but he seemed cool). Here's how we got on.\nRead more",

          "description": "Easily one of the standout PC reveals from last year's Game Awards, Dune: Spice Wars is an upcoming real-time 4X strategy game about everyone's favourite doomed sand planet. Based on Frank Herbert's acclaimed novel and made by the same folks behind Northgard and Wartales, Dune: Spice Wars will see players step into the boots of one of four factions when it launches in early access later this spring, and I've had a chance to see how one of them works in action. \nIn a hands-off presentation, developers Shiro Games showed us how the (sadly Chalamet-less) Atreides family will be going about their fight to control Arrakis' most coveted substance - the all-important spice melange - although players will also be able to choose from the shady Harkonnen clan at launch, plus two more unannounced factions that will be revealed in the coming weeks. There's a lot to take in, but if you've been waiting for a Dune game to succeed the 1992 RTS epic that was Dune II: Battle For Arrakis, well, you better pull your head out of the sand and strap on your hydro-cycling stillsuit. The battle for this year's best strategy game is about to get spicy. \nRead more",

It’s utterly massive in itself, with eight hulking single player campaigns at launch, not to mention a greatly expanded range of multiplayer and PvE skirmish options. But that’s just the start of it. For indeed, just like beloved Warhammer villain Ebeneezer Scrooge, any attempt to form an opinion on this game has to contend not just with the present, but with the bedevilments of its past and future to boot.\r\n\n\r\nWhile it is very much a game you can buy and enjoy on its lonesome, TWW3 is perhaps better considered as the last, grand instalment of a game whose release began nearly eight years ago with Total War: Warhammer. It’s a genuinely epic construction; a proper Pillars-Of-The Earth-level feat of game development. And here’s where the future sticks the boot in. Because while the last stones of this electric cathedral have been lowered into place, the phone line to God hasn’t been wired in yet.\nRead more",

          "description": "It's tempting to think that a city builder should focus on covering more ground, simulating a wider range of those elements in a bid for authenticity, or comprehensiveness.\nPower To The People takes the other approach. You're the decision maker of an energy company, tasked solely with providing electricity to towns you have no control over. Do a good job and you'll make enough money to scale up alongside the village/town/city. For such a simple premise it's surprisingly good at engaging the part of your brain that covers strategy and puzzles. Considering that power lines are normally an annoying hassle in games that simulate them at even a basic level, I'm also impressed by how entertaining it is.\nRead more",

          "description": "Whenever a game like Lost Ark comes out, it shows the public is still hungry for something that looks and sounds and plays even a tiny bit like Diablo. Lost Ark does provide what is the crudest part of the appeal of something like Diablo - i.e. a thousand chittering enemies flying at you at once as you vaporise them with minimal clicking - but I wouldn't say it's a lovingly crafted version of it. Like the difference between the Wicked Witch in Snow White and a Halloween costume in a plastic bag labelled Legally Distinct Evil Magic Stepmother. But there are also things I appreciate about Lost Ark in general, and its version of [flaps hands] whatever this is.\nIn the spirit of Lost Ark's slightly older (one might even say dated?) sensibilities, I'm going to break it down like I'm reviewing the game in a 90s game mag, separating the game into its constituent parts - just as one can remove the egg from a cake after baking it. Although I should make it clear I'm not doing our proper Lost Ark review. That honour falls to Ed, who is more plugged in to modern MMORPGs than I am. I'm just here to talk about how Lost Ark does and does not compare to Diablo - specifically Diablo II, because that's the best one.\nRead more",

          "description": "Just for a second, as you hit the apex of a particularly audacious jump, the bottom end of Dying Light 2’s audio drops out. It’s as if bass were a grounded concept you’d momentarily left behind - an earthy comfort for mortals. Then the tumble begins, and you’d better have already picked out a nice, safe spot to land. This is the irresistible dichotomy of the parkour game, as first defined by Mirror’s Edge in 2008 - an invitation to soar, with the understanding that true freedom doesn’t come for free. Height is earned, momentum is managed, and mistakes are punished with a 30 foot plunge.\nPerhaps you’ve seen footage of Dying Light 2’s rooftop running and wondered, “How much of that is me?” In a medium where climbing systems are typically automated rather than simulated, and first-person control tends to end at the waist, it’s natural to suspect that what you’re seeing is a fancy set of animations, triggered by pointing your character in a given direction and holding down the parkour key. I’m here to tell you that Dying Light 2 is not that game: it’s the real deal. It is, among many other things, Mirror’s Edge.\nRead more",

He may be referring to his own pockets, but it can't be a coincidence that he's perfectly summed up yet another of my early hands-on sessions with FromSoftware's action-RPG Elden Ring.\nThat's because I've now been able to return to the starting area of Limgrave, this time on PC and with unfettered access to all the nooks and crannies we'll be exploring in just a couple of weeks time - and I found it to be richer and more vast than, well, it had ever been. FromSoftware have tweaked some things and removed some barriers from last year's closed network test, so in a single six-hour excavation, I discovered just how ambitious this game really is. Limgrave is way bigger than I first thought. Here's what I found.\nRead more",

Some feared this hole might be present in Elden Ring too. Bamco now say that Elden Ring is fine, but those Dark Souls servers won't come back down until after FromSoftware's new game launches.\nRead more",

Sadly, in both the review build I tested and at launch, even the highest quality DLSS setting looked uncharacteristically lower-res. It was still worth using, especially if you fancied clambering over Villedor’s rooftops at 4K or with ray tracing effects, but there was a nagging sense that DLSS can do better. And now it can, for Dying Light 2’s 1.04 update is live, and sharpens Nvidia’s upscaling tech to close that gap between the rendering and native resolutions. \r\n\n \nRead more",

Specifically work at, rather than participate in. They serve drinks and clean wipe-down sofas for minimum wage, and they don't particularly want to be wearing a latex catsuit, but here we are. \nFor example, I'm pretty sure my gunslinger character works at a steampunk cowboy themed erotique parlour. I actually quite enjoy her attack style, a sort of hyper-aggressive DPS that allows her to switch between three different gun stances (pistols, shotgun and rifle). The dual pistols in particular come with a load of crowd-control AOE attacks like explosions and spinning  bullets firing smaller bullets, or something. And while there is some kind of story involving demons and a war and bits of stone (something something destiny), my gunslinger's quest is, currently, the single-minded pursuit of a pair of trousers.\nRead more",

It's an interesting story about how weird game development it is, how weird games themselves are as technical objects, and about creativity within technical constraints.\nRead more",

The poor thing was clutching a Vox Stave, and so removing his arm removed the use of his scariest abilities - although in this case the dismemberment proved academic, because it also left him exposed to immediate melee execution. That left our Interceptor free to shoot a nearby statue down on top of a cultist before stabbing him and his friend to death, which in turn gave our Apothecary enough space to chuck a grenade at a bridge and send three Poxwalkers plummeting to their doom. \nI’m no Warhammermun. Those proper nouns are all cosmic Greek to me, but I’m relieved to report they didn't obscure the promise within the 30 minutes of Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters I was shown last week. This is fast-paced XCOM in space, with extensively destructible terrain, an intriguing dual focus on ranged and melee combat, and not a miss chance in sight. That should sound enticing to just about anyone.\nRead more",

And so what better game, I thought, to test out the new cloud gaming beta on the Xbox this weekend? (In fact, I ended up downloading the game because it streamed fine at like 10am but at peak times it went all pixely, like someone had huffed on my glasses.)\nReader, I bloody love Death's Door. Like Katharine said, it's kind of a more gentle Soulslike, with a Studio Ghibli-esque flair to the character design and world. Also, there are fun jokes like a gravedigger being called Steadhone and stuff. But I also hate Death's Door, because it's still not an easy game, and I think I ended up playing it improperly this weekend.\nRead more",

They're sustained by fans' hopes and dreams of what the games might one day become but this is a double-edged sword. The developers, Cloud Imperium Games have now decided to make their public development roadmap for future updates more vague, because some players get dead narked about delays. I can see that happening after nine years.\nRead more",

Well, Agent 47 clearly needs to make the next stop on his international mission list a nice, relaxing retreat on the Mediterranean island of Pinar del Mar. Not to murder anyone, of course. But to hang out with Alba for some all important frolicking lessons. She's a pro at this skipping marlarkey. If she's not throwing her arms out like an aeroplane when she's running up and down the yellowing hills of this sleepy little island village, she's doing a jolly little skip that is probably the most delightful thing I've ever seen in a video game. In fairness, the whole game is just pure joy distilled into a chill wildlife photography adventure, but man alive, the skipping is something else. More of this please, developers.\nRead more",

This has made some fans ornery, wondering if they'll just keep on plugging away at GTAO forever, especially with GTAV coming to next-gen consoles this year.

You're the leader of a defeated army regiment, retreating across a series of regions to a stronghold where your king plans to make a last stand. It's sort of roguelike, with a hint of something like Reigns in balancing your forces and reputation, with light interactive fiction parts. I'm a little bit annoyed that I like it.\nRead more",

          "description": "Ghostwire: Tokyo is an upcoming action-adventure game from Tango Gameworks (aka the folks behind The Evil Within), which means it has ghosts and ghost-adjacent monsters in it. Last night Bethesda showed off a bit more of the game with a streamed showcase, with a ten minute breakdown of the game in action. I, however, was privy to a hands-off presentation that comprised a whole half an hour of Ghostwire Tokyo being played. What luxury!\nIt reminded me much less of The Evil Within than I expected. It has a lot of horror elements, don't get me wrong, but Ghostwire: Tokyo is much more of an action game using the language of horror to convey its themes than the other way around. Rather than spending most of your time on the back foot, creeping around in the hope you can get past a lumbering ball of dead lady limbs with most of your health intact, time in Ghostwire: Tokyo is more likely spent one-shotting headless demon schoolgirls with a bow and arrow. The general vibe, if not the specifics, reminded me a lot of classic, thundering 90s and 00s action films like Blade. So, in other words, Ghostwire: Tokyo looks rad as hell. Even better, it's also unashamedly strange.\nRead more",

After a stint working on VR games for Facebook, he's currently the chief creative officer at Bad Robot Games, the game-centric offshoot of J.J. Abrams' Bad Robot film and TV production company. But, not content with having one job at a time, Booth has also been working at Resolution Games on the VR tabletop RPG Demeo.\nA streamlined, high production values version of Dungeons & Dragons, Demeo won a lot of \"best of\" accolades in VR game round-ups. But soon it's coming to regular ol' PCs, with early access starting on April 7th. I spoke to Booth about Demeo, but also the future of co-op games. He had quite a lot to say.\nRead more",

          "description": "While it feels like we've been hearing about the TV series based on The Last of Us for quite some time, it looks like the show is further down the road than we realized. In an interview with Deadline, HBO and HBO Max chief content officer Casey Bloys revealed the show is set to debut as early as next year.\n“It’s not going to air in 2022 — they are still shooting in Canada. I imagine you will see it in ’23,” said Bloys to Deadline. \"Craig [Mazin] did Chernobyl for us, he is a fantastic writer and director. What I’ve seen looks amazing, so I’m excited for it, but it will not be in ’22.\" While it's unfortunate that we won't see The Last of Us adapted this year, it sounds like everything is very much still in production and on track to be completed by sometime in 2023.\nAnother interesting quote from the interview came from Deadline asking whether The Last of Us was seen internally as the next Game of Thrones. To which Bloys replied, \"There is no next Game of Thrones. I’ve been here long enough that I’ve been through, what’s the next Sopranos, what’s next Game of Thrones, now what’s next Succession. There is no next Game of Thrones.” \nThe Last of Us follows Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) as they try to survive in a post-apocalyptic world. Not only are the horrific zombie-like Infected an ever-present threat, but so too are other remaining humans scratching and clawing to stay alive or stay in power. The duo must traverse the United States to deliver Ellie to a promised destination. Other cast members include Anna Torv as Tess, Nick Offerman as Bill, Murray Bartlett as Frank, Gabriel Luna as Tommy, and Merle Dandridge as Marlene.",

Stranger of Paradise boasts 27 jobs and three of them are brand new to the series. The PlayStation Blog provides a rundown of what some of these jobs entail, including the ones exclusive to the title.\nThe jobs unique to Stranger of Paradise are Breaker, Void Knight, and Tyrant.  \nBreaker lets players wield the legendary sword Zantetsuken (famously wielded by classic FF summon Odin) to smash through defenses and potentially land one-hit kills. Square describes this as a trickier playstyle to master but one that can have big payoffs.\nVoid Knight allows you to counter enemy magic attacks, either by absorbing and converting them to MP or turning back against their casters.  \nTyrant buffs your normal attacks with elemental attributes to devastate enemies vulnerable to a particular element. \nOther classes revealed so far include Swordsman (which protagonist Jack begins as), Dark Knight, Black Mage, Sage, Ninja, Paladin, and Thief. At their core, these jobs function the way old-school fans would assume but expect a more action-oriented slant. For example, Sage lets you quickly swap between white and black magic for some fast-paced spellcasting.\nYou can read more details on each revealed class by visiting the PlayStation Blog. Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin launches March 18 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. You can watch the latest Frank Sinatra-themed trailer here.",

There’s no word on who will be involved, but one would imagine the main cast will stick around along with director Jeff Fowler. Sega and Paramount did not share a release window. \nThe live-action TV series features Idris Elba’s Knuckles, who makes his debut in Sonic the Hedgehog 2, and will premiere in 2023. It’s unclear if Knuckles is the star of this show or is just the first character confirmed for it but the former sounds more likely. This adds another video game series to Paramount+'s line-up alongside its soon-to-premiere Halo. To avoid potential confusion, this Sonic TV show is a separate project from Sonic Prime, the animated series that debuts on Netflix sometime this year. \n“We’ve got a remarkable partnership with Paramount, and we are excited to continue expanding the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise with them,” says Sega CEO Haruki Satomi in the press release. “2022 is shaping up to be a significant year for the franchise with the second film being released this April, as well as Sonic Frontiers, the highly anticipated video game title, coming this holiday.” \n2022 is indeed a big year for Sonic. As previously mentioned, his first open-world game Sonic Frontiers is slated to arrive later this year. You can read about how that game was originally intended to release in 2021 here.",

          "description": "Variety is reporting that Paramount Plus has a few more missions for Master Chief to go on for the streaming network. The television adaptation Halo, based on the game franchise of the same name, is getting a second season prior to the airing of its first season. \nAlong with the early renewal of the series, a new showrunner is taking over for the sophomore suite of episodes. According to Variety, Brave New World creator and Fear the Walking Dead co-executive producer, David Wiener will be helming the show moving forward. He'll be taking the place of former showrunners Kyle Killen (who left partway through season one) and Steven Kane. Kane reportedly departed the project after completing the first season due to the \"massive scope of the series\" and the two years of production it took the first set of episodes to film due to COVID complications. \nThere's no word on what kind of threats the UNSC and Master Chief will face in season two of Halo, and we likely won't know until credits roll on the debut season. Halo stars Pablo Schreiber as Master Chief/John-117, Natascha McElhone as Dr. Halsey, and Jen Taylor will reprise her role as the AI Cortana. The show also stars Bokeem Woodbine, Shabana Azmi, Bentley Kalu, Natasha Culzac, Kate Kennedy, Danny Sapani, Olive Gray, and Charlie Murphy.\nHalo premieres on Paramount Plus on March 24.

Every wrestling fan knows that the quality of the roster makes or breaks any wrestling game but that's become especially crucial for 2K22. The game arrives in the wake of a pandemic era that saw over 100 wrestlers fired by WWE, leaving fans worried and skeptical about who's left to plug up the holes. \nUsing 2K’s official roster list, as well as combing through trailers and marketing materials, we’ve put together a list of over 70 confirmed superstars for WWE 2K22. It’s worth noting that 2K’s own roster lacks names that have appeared in trailers while other faces have been confirmed via their character portraits instead of an in-game model. We're also sure you can use this list to connect the dots on who will appear (such as missing tag team partners) that have not been formally announced. We’ll update this list as new wrestlers make the cut. \nUpdate 2/14: The following superstars have been confirmed: Dakota Kai, Elias, Io Shirai, Jinder Mahal, Lacey Evans, Mandy Rose, Mansoor, Pete Dunne, and Roddy Piper. \nThe confirmed roster so far: \nAJ Styles\nDakota Kai\nKane\nSami Zayn\nNote: Jeff Hardy and Samoa Joe were previously confirmed, but given both have since been released from WWE, there's a good chance they’re no longer in the game.\nWWE 2K22 launches March 11 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.",

And if you’d rather listen to your books based on blockbuster films based on triple-A video games, Variety reports that the audiobook version has an added dose of authenticity since it’ll be narrated by the original Nathan Drake himself, Nolan North. \nUncharted: The Official Movie Novelization goes on sale on February 15 and puts the exploits of Tom Holland's Nathan Drake and Mark Wahlberg's Victor “Sully” Sullivan from screen to page. The book is written by sci-fi and horror author S.D. Perry, who previously penned a series of books based on Resident Evil, Alien, Star Trek, and other properties. North, who brought Nathan Drake to life throughout the Uncharted video game series, will lend his talent to the film’s younger spin on the hero. Per Variety, North says he won’t be imitating Holland’s performance one-to-one, saying “I kind of just did me. I tried to young him up a little bit.” North also provides his spins on Walhberg’s Sully as well as its other characters including Antonio Banderas' villain, Moncada.  \nNow that we're a week away from the film premiere, you can whet your appetite by watching Uncharted's airplane scene in its entirety here. You can also read about how the movie's director has his sights on Jak & Daxter for his next project here. Lastly, be sure to check out our new season of our Video Gameography podcast which provides a deep dive into the making and storytelling of Uncharted: Drake's Fortune. \n[Source: Variety]",

Most trailers have been about specific things within the sequel, such as salvage contracts and challenges, or new looks at gameplay running on different PlayStation consoles. Today’s trailer, however, is the most cinematic look we’ve received of Forbidden West yet and you can watch it below: \nClick here to watch embedded media\nAs you can see in the trailer, it shows Aloy’s journey across the Forbidden West. It starts in somewhat familiar territory before we see Aloy encounter some vicious dinosaur machines. We then get a new look at swimming mechanics in Forbidden West as well as a glimpse at a fight against one of the game’s new Elephant machines. Throughout the entire journey, Aloy narrates what is her biggest hunt – unknown to us at the moment – that takes her to the Forbidden West. \nIt’s a great trailer and certainly one worth watching if you’re excited about this sequel. After watching it, watch this “Meet the Cast” of Horizon Forbidden West trailer and then read about how Guerrilla Games is taking Aloy to new places in Horizon Forbidden West. Check out this story about how Horizon Zero Dawn has surpassed 20 million copies sold, just a week before the release of Horizon Forbidden West, after that. \nAre you excited for Horizon Forbidden West?

Over the next several weeks, we'll examine all of the mainline entries in Naughty Dog's blockbuster action series, so sit back and relax as we kick the season off with Uncharted: Drake's Fortune.  \nDeveloped by Naughty Dog, Uncharted: Drake's Fortune was a big release for Sony's PlayStation 3 console. Released on November 19, 2007, Uncharted brought Naughty Dog into a bold new era of \"mature\" game development. In this week's episode, we talk about Naughty Dog's history developing titles like Crash Bandicoot and Jak and Daxter, how the studio was largely unprepared for the challenges of Uncharted's development. We also talk about how Naughty Dog almost designed a game similar to BioShock, how Johnny Knoxville served as inspiration for Nathan Drake, and how Gears of War's release changed Uncharted's design for the better. \nJoin hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and ex-Game Informer editor and host of the CrossFade podcast Matt Helgeson (@MattHelgeson) as we unpack the history and impact of Nathan Drake's video game debut.  \nIf you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com.

          "description": "The first Pokémon Trading Card Game expansion of 2022 is finally ready to launch, and as such, we're here to crack open a ton of booster packs for the Sword & Shield – Brilliant Stars expansion. The expansion includes more 170 cards, including 4 Pokémon VStar cards, 20 Pokémon V, and 3 Pokémon VMax cards. In addition, Brilliant Stars features 30 Trainer Gallery cards with special art, more than 20 Trainer cards, and a new Special Energy card.\nWe were sent a ton of booster packs for the Sword & Shield – Brilliant Stars expansion. When I opened up all the packs and sorted through my pulls, I was pleased with the generational spread. While Kanto and Galar Pokémon continue to be well-represented, I noticed more Sinnoh monsters this time around. With Brilliant Diamond & Shining Pearl hitting just last year, and Legends: Arceus launching last month, this feels like a smart move.\nMy favorite cards this time around happen to fall into the Gen I category. While it's true I hold Gen I in the highest regard (thanks mostly to nostalgia), I like to think that these cards are my favorites not because of that nostalgia, but instead due to the classic-facing designs of these full-art cards. The clean art of the Pikachu V and Raichu V cards immediately caught my eye, and I always consider it a great day when I can pull a Charizard. Of course, having just put a ton of hours into Pokémon Legends: Arceus, it was cool to also pull the titular Pocket Monster from these packs. I also really like some of the Trainer cards included in this expansion, which is not something I can say about every set.\nYou can see the more than 20 cards I deemed my favorites in the gallery below.\nClick here to view embedded media\n \n\nThe Pokémon Trading Card Game: Sword & Shield – Brilliant Stars launches on February 25.
