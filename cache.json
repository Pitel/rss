Today, one that straddles both camps has been brought to our attention.\nAs flagged on BlueSky by Daniel Vuckovic, the eShop is now home to a title called 'Unpacking: Deluxe Edition'. Now, you may reasonably assume this is some kind of expansion to 2021's indie darling, Unpacking, but you would be wrong.

Whether it was to celebrate its 20th anniversary, reaffirm it as my favourite system of all time, or simply help me forget that it has been two decades since I first played Nintendogs, I can't be sure. But what I do know, is that I've been having a blast.\nNaturally, I went back to a handful of the classics first — there's nothing like a bit of Brain Training to get the blood pumping — but after proving that I had the mind of at least a 50-year-old (win!) and that I could no longer speed round a lap of Yoshi Falls with my eyes closed (lose!), I thought I'd make the most of the DS Lite's GBA cartridge slot and blast through some real nostalgia picks.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "The genre of 'Action RPG' is supremely annoying to write about, because the term can mean different things to different people, but here’s how I see it: Diablo 4 and similar games, such as Path Of Exile, are 'ARPGs'. Which stands for 'Action RPG'. But Zelda games are 'Action RPGs', which is a totally different genre that you could, if you felt like it, also shorten to 'ARPG'. So, to summarise: ARPGs and ARPGs are two different things, and both are Action RPGs. Got it? Great.\nIt’s because of this kerfuffle that I’m not exactly mad at Diablo boss Rod Fergusson recently suggesting that we just call games that are similar to Diablo 'Diablo-likes'. I just find it very funny that he’s the one saying it, in a bold faced act of admittedly very inconsequential linguistic colonialism that carries the unspoken connotation that something is \"like the game I make, but a bit crap\".\nRead more",

I'm sure for some this is riveting, but for me, it's something I tire of within seconds.\nAnd so it's with a heavy heart I say that Towers Of Aghasba suffers from the same starting gamut of sticks and stones. There's a hint of some interesting ecosystem stuff springing up a bit later, and judging by the trailers, an ability to clamber on massive flying creatures made of what looks like elephant skin and hair.

          "description": "I've gone on record as not being a huge fan of the artstyle choices used in the new Warcraft I & II remasters. It's crisp and readable, sure, but I'm never exactly thrilled to see all the roughness of older sprites completely done away with, especially when I always felt some of that ruggedness was the point. The tendency of remasters to treat every characterful oddity as a blemish is a wider topic than the scope of this article, but one day, Bluepoint will remaster Bloodborne, and the world will feel my pain. \nAnyway. Nowadays, I'd say Blizzard - or, World Of Warcraft, at least - is pretty much synomous with a softer, more colorful approach to fantasy worlds. While I don't pine for a return to the more boobily ridiculous elements of Frank Frazetta's style, I do often wish that some of the more expressive, pained, and physically grounded elements of classic Sword And Sorcery art was a bit more common. I'm no art scholar, and there's undoubtedly a bit of tunnel vision of my part to this assertion, but as far as as pop culture goes: I see the Blizzard version of fantasy more than I see the Frazetta version, and I don't exactly love it. Same goes for the older, punkier, less uniform sci-fi art from things like 2000 AD and Warhammer 40,000. Edwin touched on some of this in his excellent Space Marine piece. \nAnyway, a valued RPS community member on the Discord shared an older bit of art by Blizzard's Chris Metzen, from the original Starcraft manual. I figured a few of you might enjoy seeing these older pieces, considering how much the overall look of their games has changed over the years. \nRead more",

          "description": "It's often claimed by liars and fools that our website's title is a clever reference to the ancient Chinese game of shoushiling - or \"rock paper scissors\", as it's known overseas. The orthodox interpretation is that \"Rock Paper Shotgun\" is a folksy regional variation on this, with a \"shotgun\" instead of the \"scissors\". But friends, this is patently absurd. Think about it: a game that pits a shotgun against a rock or piece of paper would be incredibly one-sided. It goes against reason!\nThe sad reality is that the origins of our website's title have been deliberately obscured, allowing cold hard fact to slither back into legend. Behind that mockingly nonsensical moniker sleeps an eldritch truth of such gravity it would make Gandalf spill his mead. Friends, the Rock Paper Shotgun is real. The Weapon exists. Or at least, it once did - and will, for I mean to fashion it anew by combing the writing of RPS writers gone by for raw materials. And in this endeavour, I will naturally need your aid.\r\n \nRead more",

If the likes of chairs, glasses, and chewing gum can be painted stealth-bomber black and prefixed with the G word, why not something that can actually get off its harshly angled bum and help pipe the games themselves into your head?\nThen again, maybe gaming earbuds were just waiting for their moment. Obviously the Nintendo Switch is the Nintendo Switch, but the rise of handhelds like the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally has driven desires for more portable (yet games-friendly) noise-deliverers 'round these PC parts as well.

Being given my notice transformed the place from a transient pile of cadaverous lino and spasmodic plumbing into something mythical and unnerving – a whole chapter of my life completed and reduced to a piece of masonry in the rearview mirror, a relic I had been living in for years without quite realising.\nA few video game developers have investigated emotions like these by recreating their current and prior homes as virtual environments: places of mingled memory and invention, expressive of both nostalgia and surprise. At this year's Game Developer Conference in San Francisco, I interviewed a couple of teams who are coming at this premise with very different objectives, and somehow, meeting in the middle. One of the games in question is a work of daydreaming fondness, the other of comical anger.

If so, consider the compact, multifunctional ModCase, which is down to just £24 / $24.

Far from being a premeditated ambush by intelligent AI-controlled soldiers, this is just a result of the game's janky spawns. Those botched encounters are unlike previous games, where roaming bands of factional murderfolk would patrol the radioactive wastes, seemingly according to their own whims. Back in the day, this wandering baddies feature was dubbed \"A-life\" by developers GSC Game World - basically a jargon word for the simulation of enemies that would lead to \"emergent\" moments of violence and conflict. It was promised as a feature in Stalker 2 but many players have noticed it seems to be absent. Over the weekend, GSC insisted the simulation is technically present in the sequel. It's just broken.\nRead more",

Even if it’s you’re first time hearing his name, you’ll be familiar with his fingerprints on some of the setting’s most defining artwork. He’s responsible for that iconic imagine of the emprah - the one the best shows off the dark irony of a such a wretched figure becoming an idol of worship. While the term ‘grimdark’ originates from 40k’s \"in the grim darkness of the far future…\" tagline, grimdark as an aesthetic is one Blanche pioneered. There’s even a style of miniature painting - Blanchitsu - named after him.\nBasically, even games that don’t use the 40k license owe an incredible amount to Blanche’s work. That’s not to mention his influence on the fantasy setting of the Total War: Warhammer series either. His piece Harry The Hammer was the cover for the first edition of Fantasy Battle - recently added to the strategy game as chaos hero Harold Hammerstorm. I could go on, and I might do so in a bit, but here’s the news: Trademark Films are making a documentary on Blanche’s work, starring Napoleon Dynamite actor Jon Heder. It’s called The Grim And The Dark: The Search For John Blanche, and it’s out next Spring. Here’s a trailer:\nRead more",

Speaking at the G-STAR Conference in Busan earlier this month, recently appointed chief executive officer Shams Jorjani confirmed that Arrowhead are looking into such collaborations, giving the example of refitting your dropship to look like one of Halo's Pelicans, or introducing the Zerg from Blizzard's Starcraft as an enemy faction. \nJorjani cautioned listeners, however, that these injections of third-party DNA need to look and feel appropriate to the setting. After all, if you start fecklessly chucking the Zerg, Chaos Space Marines or Fifth Element's, er, flying taxis into Helldivers 2, it might spoil the meticulous coherency of a game in which saluting protects you against lethal falls and some guy called Joel is running the universe. The funny part is that according to Jorjani, Arrowhead once envisaged a system that would get round the problem of inconsistency by essentially making third-party cosmetics, including whole map skins, visible only to players who have them enabled. To put that another way, Arrowhead once envisaged a system in which individual Helldivers would hallucinate other licenses.\n  \nRead more",

The game in question, Boktai: The Sun Is In Your Hand, is a Game Boy Advance title from 2003, in which you play a vampire-slaying gunslinger. The gun you're slinging is a \"solar-powered\" pistol, which you could charge up using a cartridge-mounted photometric sensor by physically standing in sunshine. This was 13 years before the launch of Pokemon Go. Sadly, Boktai's debut didn't result in city parks or rooftops being flooded by crowds of GBA-wielding undead killers. But it was a fun gimmick and the game itself is good enough to carry it - an isometric dungeon-crawler in which you have to find a vamp's coffin and drag it to the surface for purgation.\n Read more",

          "description": "Upon some serious soul searching following a little time with the early access build of open world game Vivat Slovakia, I have unfortunately had to admit to myself that it is probably not the GTA 6 killer I was hoping for. This upsets me slightly, because I find Rockstar’s constant self-assured bloviating to be quite irritating, even though I’m sure I’ll play their game for a billion hours. What Vivat Slovakia is, then, is a very ambitious homage to the Grand Theft Auto series that isn’t shy about it, right down to the font choices. I’m not sure if you should play it, but I do feel enriched for learning of its existence. Here’s a trailer.\nRead more",

It casts you as one of several jellybaby pugilists, fighting for dominance over such locations as Ferris wheels and the tops of speeding vans. All of the characters are 1) seemingly drunk, and 2) subject to real-time physics. Your abilities consist of 1) punching, headbutting or kicking people, perhaps knocking them out for a few seconds, and 2) grabbing people and things and either hoisting them skyward like a wrestler, or hoisting yourself skyward like a toddler climbing onto Mummy's head. The only way of defeating people is to hurl them off-map.\n Read more",

You die a bunch and say: \"ah, that was good.\"\nSo what happens when you rearrange the molecules of this run and/or gun 'em up into an isometric turn-based strategy game?

          "description": "I've been trying to work out if I'm keen on Soulframe only because I feel guilty about missing the boat with Warframe. I reviewed Digital Extremes' hit free-to-play shooter in 2013, back when people were still calling it a spiritual successor to the developer's boomerang-throwing action game Dark Sector. I didn't like Warframe much at the time. Think I gave it a 6/10. Warp forward a decade, and that 6/10 game has become a thriving live service phenomenon - fifteenth on the Steam Most Played charts at the time of writing, and profitable enough to spawn its own annual TennoCon expo. It's also become an intoxicating, confusing morass of dynastic sci-fantasy politicking and genre-shifting expansions, ranging from capital ship mechanics to questions of time travel, wrapped in layers of cosmetics that make Destiny look about as colourful as Gears Of War. \r\n\n\r\nI definitely didn't see all that coming. I doubt Digital Extremes saw it coming either. Warframe today feels like a lab experiment run amok. I love its appetite for novelty, but there's a lot for a returning player to catch up on and, frankly, it feels like homework. As such, I had a couple of broad motivations for playing Soulframe's pre-alpha \"prelude\": I'm keen to see what Digital Extremes can do when they aren't encumbered by 10 years of world-building, and I want to get in on the ground floor before they absolutely swamp this thing in updates.\r\n \nRead more",

These include things like Nazi symbols in profile pictures, white supremacist slogans in group names, and yet more discriminatory spew in user posts. The senator has noticed this report, and now writes directly to Gabe Newell, demanding that Valve \"bring its content moderation practices in line with industry standards\" or risk \"intense scrutiny\" from the government.\nRead more",

That is, coming up with a set of game inputs that can win billions of possible permutations of the game, as determined by its RNG, when played simultaneously. It's an impressive feat, but the video itself is great too, patiently breaking down the process with motion graphics and video editing flair. Delightful.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "The Pumpkin Soup Disney Dreamlight Valley recipe is a magnificent appetizer for your pals like Mickey or Remy. It counts as a four-star dish, which will help you finish some Dreamlight tasks. \n\n\nPumpkin Soup Disney Dreamlight Valley ingredients\n\n\nTo create Pumpkin Soup, you'll need to find the following ingredients, and thankfully, you won't need any of the DLC like The Storybook Vale: \n\n\n\nPumpkin\n\n\nGinger\n\n\nAny vegetable\n\n\nMilk\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\n\nPumpkin Seeds or, if you're lucky, the squash vegetable itself can be bought from Goofy's Stall in the Forgotten Lands. The seeds are 275 Star Coins, while the vegetable is 996 Star Coins. By the way, if you plant many Pumpkins, they are a great way of making money as there's a lot of profit in selling these to Goofy. \n\n\nGinger can also be found in the Forgotten Lands. This time, it doesn't require your wallet. Look to the ground, and you'll find the ingredient planted in the ground. Look for a long green stalk poking out of the ground. Pick up the crop.\n\n\nMilk can be bought at Chez Remy for 230 Star Coins. You'll need to finish the quests from the Ratatouille realm to unlock the restaurant. You can find the realm in the castle. For the vegetable, you can use another Pumpkin or grow a crop that grows quickly like a Carrot from Goofy's Stall in the Peaceful Meadow. \n\n\nOnce you have all four ingredients, go to a cooking station like your house or Chez Remy. Throw all of them into the pot, and you'll have a lovely Pumpkin Soup in your possession. You can sell it for around 1,461 Star Coins (depending on the vegetable you choose) and eat the dish for 1,591 Energy. If you have the Storybook Vale DLC, you can also make Stuffed Ring Squash.\n\nThe post How to make Pumpkin Soup in Disney Dreamlight Valley appeared first on Destructoid.",

It can help you make several blue-themed items like the Blue Retro Portable Radio and others. \n\n\nBlue Star Lily Disney Dreamlight Valley Location\n\n\nYou can find a Blue Star Lily from the original valley within the Forest of Valor. Thankfully, you won't need any of the DLC like The Storybook Vale. \n\n\nScreenshots by Destructoid\n\n\nRun around the Forest of Valor (you can also find Emeralds here) and look for a blue flower growing from the grass. You don't want the bell-shaped flowers; the Blue Star Lilies have normal petals. \n\n\nYou'll be able to find around three or four of the flowers at one time. One respawns every 30 minutes, so it will take some time to craft the items you need, unfortunately. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nWhat can you craft with this flower?\n\n\nOne cute item you can make with the Blue Star Lily is a Blue Retro Portable Radio. You'll get the instructions on how to create it after picking up a Blue Star Lily. Collect the following materials and then head to a crafting table at your home or at Scrooge's shop. \n\n\n\n1 Blue Lily\n\n\n5 Softwood\n\n\n1 Iron Ingot\n\n\n\nYou can also craft Iron Ingot by collecting five Iron Ores and one Coal Ore, which you can get from mining nearby rocks. Once you have the Blue Retro Portable Radio made, you can place it as furniture inside your home. It will put on some familiar music if you interact with it.\n\nThe post Where to find Blue Star Lily in Disney Dreamlight Valley appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Palworld, or, like many call it, Pokémon with guns — or even Pokémon but cruel — is getting a massive new update. Pocketpair is teasing a new area six times larger than Sakurajima that will come packed to the brim with exciting new stuff.\n\n\nThe studio says the new update will also feature new Pals, trainers to fight against, new bosses, and will serve as a new high-difficulty challenge for fans of the original experience. The update will roll out sometime in December, with more details pending soon.\n\n\nPalworld has recently also announced a huge Terraria crossover, which we also don't know much about. Pocketpair merely released a photo of a character from Palworld shaking hands with Terraria's main guy. Will we see Palworld make the jump to 2d? Will we get to dig and build incredibly intricate torture, I mean, productivity devices in Palworld? Pocketpair promises more details will emerge soon on that one as well. \n\n\n\n\nThough we're yet to see any concrete details regarding either big update, the announcements at least prove the surprise mega-hit is far from dead. And it really needs to show its teeth, as Pocketpair is still preparing for a tough copyright battle with Nintendo over the similarities between Palworld and I'll let you guess what.\n\n\nNintendo is accusing Pocketpair of, among other patent infringements, stealing the concept of throwing a ball to capture wild creatures. Palworld sure does feature that, but Pocketpair has already stated that the studio will fight the lawsuit.\n\n\nYou can currently get Palworld for 25% off as part of Steam's Autumn sale, so this might be a great time to check it out and pick your side in the big copyright war of our times.\n\nThe post Palworld announces huge update and a Terraria crossover appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "I really enjoyed the grab bag that was Taito Milestones 2. It featured some predictable hits but then flanked them with some hilariously dreadful games, or, as I put it in that review, “bad in an almost impressive way.” So, I’ve been looking forward to Taito Milestones 3 for another injection of titles.\n\n\nThis collection is dominated by a coalition of the Bubble Bobble and Rastan series. But, like before, there is also a smattering of more obscure titles. However, this time around, I wouldn’t say any of them are “impressively bad.” But rather than just talk about them vaguely in the preamble, I’m going to take the approach I’ve started doing with arcade collections, and I’m just going to do a short review of every game in the collection. There are 10, so brace yourself.\n\n\nTaito Milestones …",

After creating their own worst enemy by screwing Sony in an effort to make a CD expansion for the Super Nintendo, they were struggling with getting their own next-generation console to the market. A lot of other companies were touting their fancy 32-bit monstrosities, and Nintendo needed something to convince people that they were still on the cutting edge. Otherwise, they might turn to Phillips, Atari, or 3DO to satiate their need for extra bits.\n\n\nSo, they turned to the inventor of the Game Boy, Gunpei Yokoi, had him put a bow around that virtual reality thing he was tinkering with, and shoved it out …",

          "description": "Surge is a legendary brawler in Brawl Stars who was first available through the Brawl Pass in Season 2: Summer of Monsters. His main attack is to shoot a juice projectile that splits when it hits enemies. \n\n\nWhat’s even better is that his Super lets him leap over walls, deal damage, knock back enemies, and upgrade his attacks and movement. With his Hypercharge, he even gets a fourth-stage upgrade that makes his shots stronger and split more often.\n\n\nHowever, like any other brawler, he also needs some enhancement in the form of a gadget, a star power, and gears. To help you with that, here is a comprehensive guide on the best build of Surge in Brawl Stars.\n\n\nBest build for Surge in Brawl Stars\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\n\nGadget: Power Surge\n\n\nStar Power: To the Max!\n\n\nGear 1: Speed\n\n\nGear 2: Damage\n\n\n\nStarting with the gadget, you can use the “Power Surge” as it increases the Surge’s Stage by one for ten seconds. However, there is a downside: Surge cannot use this gadget if he is at stage three. \n\n\nIn terms of star power, you should try on “To the Max!” as his main attack will now be split into two halves if it crosses any obstacles like walls. What’s even better is that it will split into six halves if you are in stage three.\n\n\nYou can use speed and damage gear, which will make Surge an absolute beast. Once you equip the speed gear, Surge will move 15% faster in bushes, as he is an easy target for any throwers in Brawl Stars. \n\n\nWith the damage gear, Surge will deal 15% more when his hit points are less than half. However, you can only inflict extra damage on the enemy brawlers, not any spawnable objects like Nita’s bear. So it is advised not to use this gear around them and wait for the right time to unleash your attacks.\n\nThe post Best Surge build in Brawl Stars appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "CP is one of the easiest resources to earn in UFL, but it's also the most important item you'll need to improve your squad in the latest football game.\n\n\nUnlike other titles like eFootball 2025 and EA FC 25, UFL doesn't have a gacha for unlocking footballers. There's no trading or auction market, and you have to buy cards directly. For that, you'll need RP and CP. Let's take a look at how you can get more in-game currency.\n\n\nHow to get more CP in UFL\n\n\nThe easiest way to get CP is by playing in the Ranked Mode. Every game you complete will help you earn CP, and the rate will double if you've activated Premium. The return will increase further if you're using a CP boost. At the time of writing, no other game mode will help you get this resource.\n\n\nAnother great way to get CP is by selling cards that you won't need. Your squad will have limited slots, and you can't have an unlimited number of cards. Instead of expanding the total slots, it's better to release the cards that you no longer need. This will also help you get RP, which is needed to sign new players.\n\n\nImage via Destructoid\n\n\nThe Star Pass is currently available at the launch of early access. It's very easy to activate the Premium track, which has better rewards. Some of these rewards will grant you CP boosters, which will fetch you more resources whenever you're completing a match in a competitive mode.\n\n\nCompleting daily objectives is key. As of writing, weekly objectives aren't available, but completing the daily tasks will help you get SP, LP, and CP. All three items are vital if you want to quickly improve your squad.\n\n\nUFL might be a free game, but you can spend real-life money to buy CP directly from the shop. You can't buy RP directly, so spend accordingly and try to even out your expenses to build your squad in a balanced fashion.\n\nThe post How to earn CP in UFL appeared first on Destructoid.",

The challenge was to develop a solution to prevent non-approved 'pirate' set-top devices from functioning in people's homes. The team say they were able to remotely transfer code which completely disabled a target device. Once implemented, \"there will be a general failure in most of the irregular boxes in use,\" the hacker predicted.\nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",

          "description": "Castle Master, the haunting conclusion to the Freescape engine saga, is now ready for public testing!\nPrepare yourself for a perilous adventure as you lower the drawbridge to enter the Castle Master’s domain. Released in 1990 by Incentive Software, Castle Master became popular for its technical innovation and challenging gameplay. The game inspired countless 3D adventure titles, and the Freescape engine itself marked a technological milestone, enabling groundbreaking object interaction and spatial puzzles.\nNotably, Castle Master was one of the first games to let you choose to play as either a prince or a princess, offering a different experience depending on your choice.\nYour mission: rescue your twin, imprisoned within the eerie depths of Castle Eternity by the evil Magister. This sprawling, foreboding castle is filled with traps, monsters, and puzzles blocking your path. Gather items, unlock doors, and solve complex riddles as you navigate the labyrinthine halls and confront the dark forces within.\nThis modern reimplementation showcases enhanced graphics using OpenGL, with initial support for the DOS and ZX Spectrum releases. If you’re eager to embark on this dark journey, a playable demo is available to test your tenacity.\nTo participate in the testing, ensure you have a daily development build. We encourage all players to submit feedback and bug reports through our issue tracker.\nWill you brave the creepy corridors of Castle Eternity and free your sibling, or will you fall victim to the Magister’s curse and join his army of enslaved spirits? The adventure awaits!\n>",

The support is announced for:\nWait for it! Issue 3. Song for a Hare, (Russian: Ну, погоди! Выпуск 3. Песня для зайца, Lithuanian: Na, palauk!

День рождения морской крысы, Polish: Były Sobie Myszki Trzy: Urodzinowe Śledztwo)\nOther games do work; however, we haven’t playtested them. You may find more information on our Wiki. Also, we are looking for the Lithuanian version of Little Longnose and Polish releases of Little Mice games and Wait for it! game. If you happen to have a copy, please contact sev.\nWe continue the active development so that support for other games will follow shortly. The primary constraint is playtesting.\nTo run these games, you need the latest daily build of ScummVM. If you encounter any hiccups during your quests, please file them on our issue tracker.\n>",

          "description": "Nevím, co je \"legálně\" zapotřebí k tomu, aby se mohl film nazývat \"dokumentem\", ale tohle působí jako zcela standardní nízkorozpočtový hraný film. Je to hořká komedie, která těží z atmosféry jednotlivých scén (velmi rozvláčných), aniž by měla jakýkoliv podstatný děj, směřující k nějakým pointám. (Ilča 40 %)",

          "description": "Dokument, který je profesionálně natočen, tzn. má tempo a atmosféru, je přehledný a dobře se na něj dívá. Co je to ale platné, když film zcela selhává v tom hlavním, tzn. v tom, aby nám nastínil, co se vlastně tehdy tomu děvčeti stalo a proč bychom se o to měli zajímat. Je nadhozeno několik navzájem si odporujících teorií (z nichž žádná není nijak překvapivá), nic se neprokáže, nic se neodhalí, a je konec. (Ilča 30 %)",
