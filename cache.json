Having given it more thought, I think there are two metaphors: 1) It plays quite like Persona. 2) Its story is like a commentary on our society… or something to that effect.\nMetaphors aside, though, the game is a gigantic fantasy RPG that's technically better than Persona 5 in a lot of ways. Structurally, it feels less repetitive. It has more animated cutscenes that elevate those key story moments. You can brush aside weaker enemies in real-time combat, rather than face them in tiresome turn-based tangoes. And overall, I think it's the best game Persona or Persona-like Atlus have put out - it really is brilliant. But there's a part of me that feels like it's missing something that'll leave it less ingrained in the memory than Persona 5 once its final chapter has closed.\nRead more",

          "description": "There’s a genre of lesser fun that only makes itself known to me once I’ve completely given up on enjoying a game in any traditional sense, lurking under the surface like a silly icon on a losing scratchcard. I’ll call it ‘system tourism’ in lieu of something better. It’s not like the actually fulfilling virtual tourism you might do in something like Yakuza’s Kamurocho, where you’re scarfing down deep fried whiskeys, entranced by the lights. It’s more like doing a Google street view tour of Venice’s canals to see if you can spot someone taking a leak off the side of a gondola - hunting for anarchic anomalies because, honestly, the sights just aren’t grabbing you.\nAt the risk of sounding like some sort of horrible joy-mathematician: My experience with open world zombie survival game Dread Dawn involved precisely two and half discrete instances of fun, plus some additional appreciation for a few genuinely good ambient bits I’ll get into shortly. With a significant overhaul of basically every player interaction Dread Dawn offers - from the abysmally tedious looting to the rusty combat -  it might some day be worth your time. It harbours some incredible ambition, though it’s surrounded by murk and detritus, like a dictatorial rat in a toilet bowl. Mostly, though, I can only give you advance warning to avoid it.\nRead more",

          "description": "My default movement mode in horror games that actually scare me is: meandering. I seek to approach without approaching, scooting back and forth across the path like a stray hamster, worrying at the corners and avoiding clear perspectives of the route ahead, while keeping the route behind me in my peripheral vision. I have been trained to do this especially by Amnesia, where tilting your gaze too decisively at anything nasty drives your character nuts.\nLurks Within Walls has no time for my hamstery antics. Developed by Here Be Monsters, it's a grid- and turn-based first-person dungeon crawler - a long-lost cousin of Etrian Odyssey that has wound up in an asylum jammed with internet cryptids, reminiscent in cinematic texture of F.E.A.R. In keeping with other grid-based dungeon crawlers, it only lets you turn the view by 90 degree angles and travel in straight lines. Going by the demo, it's a promising restraint for a horror game, though they really do need to expand on the combat, which is currently a slight waste of some terrific creature art. \r\n \nRead more",

Its visuals are stark and foreboding, its dialogue delivered in riddles, and its haunting choral music sounds like it's been recorded in a wind tunnel. It’s a point-and-click that calls back to early 90’s Lucas Arts adventure games, and while it shares the same frustrations, the presentation makes it feel entirely contemporary. What begins as a standard detective game - chatting to strangers, rummaging through junk, finding addresses found on the net - soon spirals into something else entirely. I’ve finished it twice and I’m still not sure I totally understand what it all means.\nRead more",

Neglect to do so, and you'll pop your clogs. It's the kind of mechanical tomfoolery you'd associate with Peter Molydeux, but in this case, it's all the fine work of Stephen's Sausage Roll developer increpare and Quadrant developer undef. The developers have somehow gotten 50 levels out of this meme-ish premise, and it looks like quite an elaborate hop-and-bopper with some less-cheerful political overtones.

While we await his verdict, here's another excerpt from a chat with Bloober earlier this summer, in which I pop the extremely imaginative question of what they'll do after remaking Silent Hill 2. The answer, in brief, is more games with a manual third-person view that rely on ambience, suspense and the thrill of the unknown, rather than monsters going \"boo!\"\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's a wildly camp musical and B-movie homage for stage and screen, in which two homely, heteronormative Americans seek shelter in a castle run by Tim Curry's high-kicking mad scientist Dr Frank-N-Furter. I can't speak for how well it has aged, but it was a hit work of sexual counterculture in the 1970s, and is absolutely Curry's finest hour outside of Command And Conquer. \r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "I do not wish to dwell overly long on the incredible stop motion sheep in the trailer for folk horror game Daemonologie, because it’s got so much else going for it - from the gorgeously haunting vocal and string melodies to the extremely dark character interactions that offer your witch finder the choice between 'talk' and 'torture'. And yet, living in Wales for the last decade must have rubbed off. The sweet sheep, they sing to me. The relative rarity of stop motion and other practical effects in horror media is surely one of the greater tragedies of our age, although not too surprising given the incredible amount of work it takes. Flock toward the trailer below, and I’ll see you on the other side of the pasture, hopefully as deeply altered by the experience as I was.\nRead more",

The latest to catch my fancy is party-based RPG Banquet For Fools, out in Early Access today with a demo. Created by two-person Hannah and Joseph Games, it casts you as one of the Vollings - a race of gaunt elven humanoids, hailing from the same school of manky action-figure as Judero, who have been shunned by their gods and have accordingly turned to paganism. \r\n\n\r\nSpecifically, you're a lord who has set up a spice farm on a \"cursed\" island, the former home of a long-dead civilization. This certainly sounds like a foolish thing to do, and it's no huge surprise that everybody on your farm has gone missing. So off you trot with a team of four custom-generated companions to solve the mystery, and also make up gnarly spells by daubing your blood on trees.\r\n \nRead more",

There are noticeable additions - particularly new tactics controls and a 5v5 Rush mode - and I’m glad they’re here.

Make some duplicates, invent a few rules and lo, you have systems. \r\n\n\r\nConversely, the great drawback of cards - especially in those roguelite deckbuilders people have been churning out since Slay The Spire - is that everything can be reduced to them. For example: last night, I played a round of Fungi with my partner, Fungi being a charming tabletop foraging sim in which you gather scrumptious chantarelles and boletus from the forest floor. This morning I resumed playing Breachway, out now in early access, in which you guide a starship through a series of wartorn solar systems, with battles unfolding as a turn-based exchange of cards corresponding to ship components. \r\n\n \nRead more",

I’ve got the weekend to sort this garden, and a cosy little shed to sleep in, so I really should just get on with it. Again, though, I must reiterate: I keep digging up… objects.\nI go to clean some rubbish from the bathroom. I interact with the mirror and the game says: “You do not see anything in the mirror”.

          "description": "Experimental, feature-length simulation game Apartment Story is not especially brilliant, but it does feature a home invasion that’s stressful in several, systemically tangible ways I’ve never quite felt in such a specific combination from a videogame before. It’s partly a story about mental health, partly about the absolute horror of not just managing a Sim but actually being one, and partly about seeing how many wanks and cheese sandwiches you can fit into a single morning. Yes, I washed my hands afterward. Ah, but after which?\nRead more",

Stone's forthcoming Known Mysteries is a ritual of the sun, I guess. Slated for launch on 23rd October, it's the first of several, creatively low-carbon projects that will run off a custom, solar-powered server Stone has set up on her apartment balcony in Calgary, Canada.\n Read more",

For those who don't know the game, this third-person helljaunt sees its players wandering through the battlefields of an endless conflict between three major world powers. Mechs stomp past you, ignoring you in favour of decimating enemy soldiers. Bug-like drones hover overhead, scanning for prey. And horrifying mommy harvesters scavenge bodies from the debris. As a collection of imagery, it's powerful stuff. As a game that you can play (with up to three pals) it is very rough, and not just around the edges. \nRead more",

You play a detective out to stop a serial killer with a grisly pattern who's preying on the young women of an unnamed US city. On top of the obligatory tank controls, it aims to have \"consequential dialogue choices\" and a \"Time Event system where you must meet certain people at specific times to forward different story threads\".

          "description": "Last year we reported horror game Alan Wake 2 would be getting a couple of expansions. We've already had one of these in the form of Night Springs. And Edwin noted that the other would probably be a crossover with Remedy's other big game, Control, featuring secret government agency, the Federal Bureau of Control. He was right, judging by the trailer shown at yesterday's PlayStation Showcase. \nThe Lake House DLC is due out in October, and does indeed feature a facility run by the shady organisation whose job it is to keep powerful \"altered items\" from running amok. But it looks like somebody let a messed-up oil painting out of its cage.\nRead more",

They have just released GreedFall 2: The Dying Land into early access. For those who don't remember the first GreedFall, it was a colonial-styled RPG about landing on the magical shores of another continent and getting into scrapes with monsters and frontiersfolk. This time the story is furthering the fantasy Columbian exchange by putting you in the role of a native who's been uprooted against their will and taken to the \"old world\". The game's release comes against a backdrop of dissatisfaction in the studio. But workers have gained some concessions in talks. \nRead more",

          "description": "The long-awaited first expansion for Diablo IV, Vessel of Hatred, is finally here. However, the new expansion is giving players an Unable to find a valid license for Diablo IV error at launch. Here is how to fix the Unable to find a valid license for Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred at launch time.\n\n\nHow to fix Unable to find a valid license for Diablo IV\n\n\nIn order to fix the Unable to find a valid license for Diablo IV error that's occurring at the launch of Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred, you're just going to have to hang tight and wait it out. Unfortunately, Blizzard issued a last-minute slight delay for the highly anticipated expansion, indicating the company needs additional time to ensure a simultaneous launch across platforms.\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Diablo Global Director of Community Adam Fletcher, the goal is still to launch this evening and he anticipates a delay of no more than a couple of hours. At approximately 7pm EST, Adam indicated that the login servers were locked and that Steam players could now download the 2.0.2 patch for launch.\n\n\nUntil the servers come back online, and Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred officially launches, you will not be able to login to access the game and will continue to receive errors such as Unable to find a valid license.\n\n\nWe will update this post in realtime throughout the evening as we join you in the excitement for the first Diablo 4 expansion launch! What class do you plan to go first? Spiritborn, right?\n\nThe post How to fix Unable to find a valid license for Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred appeared first on Destructoid.",

The Standard Edition, originally priced at $39.99, is now $30 cheaper. You can make it yours by just paying $9.99. In terms of discount on offer, it's certainly one of the cheapest prices of all time.\n\n\nIs the Death Stranding Sale on Best Buy worth buying?\n\n\nIn one word - yes. Death Stranding is a kind of video game that might not be suitable for everyone. It's not a typical run-of-the-mill RPG with a linear system. Instead, it's an amazing experience where you'll have to enjoy everything that's happening around you.\n\n\nThe Standard Edition has a few shortcomings compared to the more expensive Director's Cut. To get the Director's Cut, you'll have to shell out $40 extra, as you'll have to get it at $49.99. At $9.99, it certainly allows you to experiment as well. Even if you don't like Death Stranding after playing the game, you've only spent a fraction of its original price.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, Death Stranding 2 is in the making, and it's set for a release in the future. We have no idea as to what the exact storyline will be, but there's confirmation about it being a sequel. There's no better way to set yourself up for it than to play the first title. With the Best Buy deal and a festive season coming up, there's no better time to grab your copy of Death Stranding on PlayStation.\n\nThe post Death Stranding is Now on Sale with a Massive Price Drop for PS4 and PS5 appeared first on Destructoid.",

During the Halloween season, you can now listen to some chill music inspired by the horror title while studying or working. \n\n\nLofi Girl Alien Isolation collab's taken some by surprise\n\n\nThis is \"a collab I was not at all expecting,\" said YouTube user @Owlgineer with the top-rated comment. \"At least now I can vibe out while hiding from Xenomorphs.\"\n\n\n\n\nIt may seem like a strange collab out of the blue, but it has been published on SEGA's YouTube channel as part of the publisher's 10th anniversary celebrations for the hit horror game. \"Put on your headphones and relax through space… but don't forget to check your motion tracker,\" warns SEGA in the video's description. HoKø has created the music, which successfully chills you but at the same time, maintains its horror-like essence with odd atmospheric sounds sprinkled in.\n\n\nSEGA also announced on Monday that an Alien Isolation sequel is in the works. The creative director Al Hope returns with the game's original studio Creative Assembly back to develop the title. It's currently in early development. \"We look forward to sharing more details with you when we're ready,\" said Hope in a social media message released Monday. \n\n\nAlien Isolation is a beloved horror game from 2014 that has high critical praise. It has an 81 Top Critic rating on OpenCritic. \"Isolation has some flaws, but it’s faithful to the film series, and I’d love to see a follow-up with a few extra alien evolutions,\" said our 8.5/10 review from Destructoid's Editor-in-Chief Chris Carter, who will likely get his wish.\n\nThe post Lofi Girl and Alien Isolation collab for 10th anniversary appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Throne and Liberty is currently one of the biggest games on Steam, but an issue has been ruining the otherwise great experience to a lot of players. I'm talking about of \"Different Milestones\", an ominous and mysterious message that shows up before players get barred from joining one of the game's servers. What's that all about?\n\n\n\"Different Milestones\" pertains to a problem stemming from the early access version of the game's integration with the launch version. If you created your character and started your quest during the early access period, you might not be able to join a server running the final version of the game. That's because some of the milestones you've achieved in the early access period of the game are not compatible with the launch server.\n\n\nImage via Reddit\n\n\nEven worse, some players are complaining that characters created in Launch Servers can join Early Access servers, but won't be able to return to Launch Servers. I do not know if this will happen to all accounts or has to do with the amount of progress achieved, but I advise against risking it for the time being.\n\n\nTo avoid the problem altogether, you should just create a new character in the launch server and avoid ever switching to the old ones. \n\n\nThis issue is bumming a lot of players, as many paid for early access and already had a lot of progress from the early days of Throne and Liberty. It's possible that Throne and Liberty's devs at NCsoft will at some point fix this issue and allow players to join with their characters made in early access, but there's no guarantee of when or if it will happen.\n\n\nIssues between early access and final versions aren't unique to Throne and Liberty, but they're a bummer that can totally be prevented. Larian, for example, managed to gracefully avoid similar issues before the release of Baldur's Gate 3\n\n\n\nThe post Throne and Liberty: Different Milestones server issues explained appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Destiny 2 has a lot of materials for you to collect for one reason or another. Sometimes that'll be something short-term like a season reward, but other times that material lasts much, much longer. Take Ascendant Shards for example, which are useful for masterworking certain pieces of gear.\n\n\nOne such resource can be either easy or difficult to get depending on what sort of content you do, but is always useful. Here's how to get Spoils of Conquest in Destiny 2.\n\n\nWhere to find Spoils of Conquest in Destiny 2\n\n\nImage via Bungie.\n\n\nSpoils of Conquest are earned upon completing any raid encounter. This can be from whatever raid you wish, though the weekly featured raid will be the best way to earn them. This is because, while you can run a raid once a week on each character, the featured raid of the week will drop loot on every encounter regardless of how many times you've run it that week. This means you can farm a specific encounter like the final boss of that raid since many others will be running it as well.\n\n\nWhat are Spoils of Conquest used for?\n\n\nYou can spend the Spoils of Conquest you get from these raid encounters on weapons and armor from those raids. To do so, defeat the final boss of any raid and interact with the object that appears after the boss is defeated. This will open a menu where you can spend your Spoils on whatever you want. Any weapons you purchase will have random perks, while any armor will have a random stat distribution. If you want to farm god rolls from a raid, this is a massive helping hand.\n\n\n\nThe post How to get Spoils of Conquest in Destiny 2 appeared first on Destructoid.",

It can be found in two separate biomes in this Disney title. \n\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\n\nTuna Disney Dreamlight Valley location\n\n\nTuna can be spotted in the Glade of Trust and Forgotten Lands, just like Squid. However, you'll find Tuna from white ripples within the waters of these locations, not blue. Search the rivers and ponds of these biomes and get your rod out to catch the Tuna you require. You should be able to find the fish fairly easily. If you don't see a white ripple, however, try to catch a fish from a different colored ripple for a chance of a white ripple appearing straight afterward.\n\n\nIf you catch a Tuna, you can sell it for 95 Star Coins and eat it for 350 Energy. You'll likely want to make a dish with the Tuna, on the other hand. This ingredient is also collected for one of Nala's quests. \n\n\nHow to make a Tuna Burger\n\n\nYou can make a Tuna Burger fairly easily in Disney Dreamlight Valley, and it's surprisingly a five-star meal. You'll require the following:\n\n\n\nTuna\n\n\nLemon\n\n\nWheat\n\n\nOnion\n\n\nA vegetable of your choice (Carrots, for example)\n\n\n\nLemons grow on trees in the Glade of Trust and Forest of Valor. Wheat is purchased from Goofy's Stall in the Peaceful Meadow. Onions and Onion seeds are bought from Goofy's Stall in the Forest of Valor. You can then use any vegetable of your choice, such as a Carrot, Lettuce, or Potato. After piling them all into a pan at a stove in Chez Remy or your house, you'll finally have a Tuna Burger in your grasp. You could also make a Vegetarian Stew if you'd like.\n\nThe post Where to find Tuna in Disney Dreamlight Valley appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Destiny 2's exotic weapon sandbox is vast, with plenty of different toys playing with one another. One great example of this is exotic hand cannons, which play well into the Hunter's Lucky Pants exotic leg armor.\n\n\nHowever, the Lucky Pants hand cannon combo is far from the only combo you can pull off. Another great combo involves an SMG from a few expansions ago, though one that still holds its own. Here's how to get the Osteo Striga exotic SMG in Destiny 2.\n\n\nWhere to find the Osteo Striga in Destiny 2\n\n\nImage via Bungie.\n\n\nThe Osteo Striga can be earned by completing the Witch Queen campaign. This requires you to own the Witch Queen DLC, so you'll need to purchase it first if you haven't already. Once you've finished the campaign, you'll receive a blueprint for the Osteo Striga which can be taken to the Enclave. Head over to the crafting station there, and you can craft yourself the Osteo Striga.\n\n\nLike many other exotics in modern-day Destiny 2, you can change the attachments of the Osteo Striga to suit your needs. If you want to customize it yourself, the following build is considered the best by the community:\n\n\n\nBarrel: Polygonal Rifling\n\n\nMagazine: Flared Magwell\n\n\nStock: Hand-Laid Stock\n\n\n\nThe attachments above give the Osteo Striga better stability and faster reloads, meaning you'll pump out damage on target much more easily.\n\n\nIs the Osteo Striga worth using?\n\n\nThe Osteo Striga's intrinsic trait is Screaming Swarm, causing bullets to track whichever target you're firing. When these enemies are killed, they will cause a burst of poison that infects nearby targets, dealing damage over time. While this on its own is excellent for ad-clear, it's especially great for Warlocks running the Necrotic Grips exotic arms. These cause those poisoned targets to spread their poison further when they die, adding to the ad-clear potential.\n\nThe post How to get the Osteo Striga exotic SMG in Destiny 2 appeared first on Destructoid.",

When I say “poor sales,” I want to stress those quotation marks since it reportedly sold 2.11 million units in its first six months. To me, that sounds like an awful lot, but Sega deemed this to be a failure in the AAA market, probably because of its budget.

You can download the Cloud Strife Clive outfit here if you'd like. Here is Jill's outfit on Aerith, which was posted on Sunday.

Fingers crossed. We'll likely see more mods for Final Fantasy VII Rebirth if and when the game launches on PC. It's currently a PS5 exclusive and has underperformed sales-wise for its publisher Square Enix. \n\n\nAccording to Square Enix President Takashi Kiryu (via Bloomberg), Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Final Fantasy XVI, and Foamstars all \"fell short of the Japanese game publisher’s expectations in both revenue and profit.\" Square Enix shares as a result fell 16% in May.\n\n\nDespite reportedly poor sales, there's much fan support for Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and Final Fantasy XVI. In fact, it was nominated for Console Game of the Year at The Golden Joystick Awards.

And, in fact, it appears to have been successful enough to warrant a sequel, which is due to launch in 2026 according to new sources.\n\n\nThis information was spotted by Eurogamer in the publisher CI Games' latest product roadmap document, which spells out some really good news for the studio in the short term. Broadly, CI Games is currently enjoying fairly solid financial positioning with a good idea of where it needs to go next. The focus appears to fall squarely on two of its intellectual properties: Lords of the Fallen and Sniper: Ghost Warrior, both of which are due to receive new entries over the next couple of years.

          "description": "There are two types of Counter-Strike 2 players. Those who have Prime, and those who don't. No, not Amazon Prime - Counter-Strike 2 Prime, an account status that comes with a bunch of benefits for players who own it.\n\n\nBut is CS2 Prime Status actually worth the money? Let's take a look.\n\n\nWhat is Counter-Strike 2 Prime Status?\n\n\nImage via Valve\n\n\nCounter-Strike 2 Prime Status is an optional extra that you can pick up from the Steam Marketplace. While Counter-Strike 2 is usually free-to-play, there are a slew of benefits you gain from picking up Prime Status.\n\n\nFor a one-time purchase of $14.99, you gain access to XP, competitive skill groups, and Premier Mode. You also get a weekly in-game drop by playing matches, giving you a skin and a free CS2 case to open.\n\n\nAll of that is great, but those perks aren't the real selling point of Counter-Strike 2 Prime Status. You see, Prime players can only be matchmade with other Prime owners. Why is that important? Cheaters. Naturally, cheaters use free-to-play servers to avoid losing money if banned, and Prime Status circumvents this entirely.\n\n\nIs Counter-Strike 2 Prime Status worth it?\n\n\nImage via Valve\n\n\nIn a word, yes. I'd go as far as to say Counter-Strike 2 Prime Status is essential if you want to have fun in the game at the moment.\n\n\nThe cheating problem in CS2 remains so, so bad, even in Premier Mode, where Prime is required. Valve continues to iterate on VAC, but until it is perfected, cheaters will continue to run rampant in Counter-Strike 2. This is amplified on non-Prime servers, where accounts don't need to pay a $14.99 entry fee to get involved. If they do get banned, they can just create another and try again!\n\n\nCheating issues aside, Prime Status pays for itself eventually, anyway. You can sell the free weekly drops you earn instead of using them. If you're someone who plays a lot of Counter-Strike 2, this will add up to the amount you paid over a long period of time. \n\nThe post Is Counter-Strike 2 Prime Status worth it? appeared first on Destructoid.",

Prior to the grand final of the Halo World Championship 2024 eSports tournament, the developer confirmed that it has rebranded to Halo Studios, turning a new page for the legendary franchise.\n\n\nIt also revealed that Halo Studios will move to Unreal Engine 5 for all future projects, of which several are in development. This marks a move away from its proprietary game engine, the Slipspace Engine, making it easier for new developers to come in and hit the ground running.\n\n\nImage via Halo Studios\n\n\nHalo is making the jump to Unreal Engine 5\n\n\nHalo Studios revealed the news with an impressive UE5 video showcase titled Project Foundry, hitting all the classic Halo notes: Master Chief, Elites, Energy Swords, and even the Flood.\n\n\n\n\nNothing was officially confirmed, but given what was shown, it looked suspiciously like the Halo: Combat Evolved remaster that was rumored back in June. Are they teasing it right in front of our eyes? Only time will tell. Regardless, it looks stunning, with mind-blowing environments that look closer to Blur Studios' Halo 2: Anniversary cutscenes than any real-time gameplay seen before in the series.\n\n\n\nImage via Halo Studios\n\n\nImage via Halo Studios\n\n\nImage via Halo Studios\n\n\nImage via Halo Studios\n\n\n\nAs 343 Industries, the studio has developed three mainline Halo games since being founded in 2007: 4, 5: Guardians, and Infinite. Each title had positives and negatives, although it's generally agreed that the series hasn't quite reached the dizzying heights of its Bungie days. Can this rebrand and move to Unreal Engine 5 help secure a brighter future for Halo?

Hutná atmosféra, tvořená novými permutacemi starých klišé, bez nutnosti uchylovat se k lekačkám a stříkající krvi. Nepotřebuji to vidět znovu, ale dlouho jsem něco tak kvalitního neviděl a nevšiml jsem si mnoha věcí, které by se daly zlepšit. (Ilča 80 %)",

          "description": "Velmi příjemné překvapení. Dobře napsané i zahrané scény mezi lidmi, kterým poněkud nefunguje komunikace a navzájem si připadají \"trochu divní\". Fungovalo by to dobře jako normální (nehororové) současné drama. Ke konci se to trochu zvrhne do standardní vyvražďovačky, ale pořád výrazný nadprůměr s několika výbornými scenáristickými nápady. Neviděl jsem dánský originál. (Ilča 60 %)",
