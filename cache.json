          "description": "To kick off with some extremely half-arsed mytho-geometry, the original Frostpunk was a testament to both the design utility and the inexhaustible political symbolism of circles. When people wish to found a community of equals they commonly form a circle, with each participant visible and audible to the rest. A circle is also the best shape for defending against an engulfing ambient threat such as a global ice age, because it has no weak points, and it makes a great centrepiece for a videogame interface, a symmetrical motif that can be tuned and adorned to either suck your attention into the screen or distribute it evenly in all directions.\nCreated by Polish developers 11 bit, Frostpunk takes place in the middle of a circle, an Arctic crater with a huge coal generator at its heart. Your city rises in rings around that generator, each additional layer of dwellings corresponding intuitively to decreasing temperature, and the result is one of the most focused and thematically consistent specimens of its genre - a building game that feels as intimate and urgent as tending a campfire. Frostpunk 2's new campaign mode breaks the circle open. It starts where you (hopefully) ended, with the crater now fully colonised and evolved into a glaring, blue-orange geode of high-density housing and clustered chimneys. But the view has been pulled back, and construction now unfolds along the plains and canyons beyond the crater, which consist not of circles but of hexagons - another UI designer's favourite - on which you'll plot out upgradeable districts rather than assembling individual buildings. \r\n \nRead more",

You’ll quickly realise this a school-with-no-trousers-esque dream sequence, but the matted mess of thick black cables that carpet this dingy side-stage is painfully accurate. Pissing around with gear is roughly 70% of the band experience, in my limited experience of being in bands. This probably changes when you’ve got roadies or dedicated tech people, but we did not, because we were skint. And also terrible.

Still, if we take for granted the idea that a review is only really valuable as an insight into the experience of the player: I haven’t been feeling especially great this week. That in mind: Splintered Sea is more Besiege, thoughtfully applied to its already expansive toolkit. More importantly, it's currently bringing me deep and deeply needed moments of untainted, childlike, vaguely-Orkish joy.\nRead more",

Innocent times and places like the prologue for Baldur's Gate, which unfolds in the vast, fortified monastery of Candlekeep (beware spoilers from this point on).\nBioWare's first ever RPG opens with your unsuspecting Chosen One learning the ropes from the old sage Gorion. There are fetchquests that take you around the enormous citadel, bits of combat training to do, cosy formative chinwags to have with characters like your childhood friend Imoen. But it's not to last, of course: Gorion is murdered, and you must rove the Sword Coast in pursuit of his killer. When you return to Candlekeep later in the game, this once-proud bastion of learning has been filled with doppelgangers of Gorion and other acquaintances, a parade of chatbots waiting to stab you in the back.\r\n \nRead more",

The kind that probably has twelve artists dedicated to the recreation of visible pores, that sort of thing. It’s so focused on looking pretty that it hasn’t even noticed the title and subtitle got mixed up.\nSure enough, Hellblade 2 is a harsh test for older hardware, with a heavy reliance on DLSS or FSR upscaling to keep performance sweet. That said, it’s no Dragons Dogma 2-style technical horrorshow either. A happy balance of visuals and smoothness is attainable on plush PCs and low-end laptops alike, while DLSS 3 frame generation can deliver an effective kick in the framerate pants on RTX 40 series GPUs.\nRead more",

After some games arrived on the Epic Games Store in 2021, Squeenix have confirmed that multiple Kingdom Hearts games are coming to Steam next month, on June 13th. Unlucky for some, maybe, but not Donald Duck and Goofy, two of the main characters. Long has Goofy been seen as just a joke character in the minds of people people who didn't watch A Goofy Movie.

All very upbeat. Well, hold that thought, because on the 21st, it's time for Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2, another slice of Celtic sort-of-psychosis from Ninja Theory, which is as grim as the accompanying Paper Trail is *checks Nic's review* incredibly annoying?\n  \nRead more",

          "description": "I've clocked up nearly 400 hours playing BioWare's big fantasy RPG Dragon Age: Inquisition, which is not a stat I'm particularly proud of. I'm not ashamed either, partly because, as has been identified by artist Corey Brickley, via the Maw, there's a lot of filler. Brickley has collated a list of suggested mods to slim down Dragon Age: Inquisition from a potentially 80 hours-long epic to a trim 40 hour story-focused romp, which means you might be able to play through it again in time for the launch of Dragon Age: Dreadwolf - which is a direct sequel to Inquisition.\nI find this list of mods interesting! It's a way to change the game quite substantially without exactly transforming it, and it's very in-keeping with my campaign to make games 60% smaller.

Easily doable, for most aspiring galactic admirals.\nOnce a battle gets underway, however, Homeworld 3’s performance can start tanking, turning an initially smooth engagement into a more stutter-prone light show. The good news? You can more than double your framerates with a relatively small handful of graphics setting changes, even if some these (including the DLSS and FSR 2 upscalers) can be a tad inconsistent in their own right.\nRead more",

          "description": "Last week, I watched one of my favourite badminton players Kento Momota play his final match. As he stepped off court for the last time, I found myself welling up. He doesn't know me - of course he doesn't - and I don't know him. But for ten years I'd watch him at every opportunity and see him grow into one of the all-time greats. For me, his retirement wasn't only devastating in the sense he was a great ambassador for the sport: a positive soul, a good speaker, a hard worker. No, it also spelled the end of us being able to witness something impossible to replicate, a 'game' of badminton uniquely his. And for a magical two years, he had the best game in the world.\nRead more",

The first is that it's a brighter, glitzier version of Toby Fox's Undertale that looks like it belongs on Gameboy Advance - a retro parody created in GameMaker whose turn-based combat houses many an inventive minigame, and whose writing doesn't so much break the fourth wall as moonwalk along the parapet, showering the player in poop, anime tropes and off-colour mental health advice. \r\n \nRead more",

And that's alongside promised tweaks to how progression works, too. Huh. It's often you see paid games go free-to-play, but this is an unexpected switcheroo.\nRead more",

The Musk era has transformed what was already fondly known as a hellsite into something at once more obnoxious and sadder, whether you're talking about the web3 grifters or the resurgent debate-me cryptofascists or the recommendation algorithm's perceptibly greater enthusiasm for quote-tweet flamebait.\nStill, there are lights in the darkness. Yesterday, Graham pointed us towards a thread started by The End Is Nigh developer Tyler Glaiel in which he challenged other developers to \"take a short break, pick a number in your code or data files, multiply it by 1000, and post the results\". Other developers have heeded the call. Here's a round-up of the results that doubles as a watery echo of Alice0's (RPS in peace) old Screenshot Saturday Monday features.\n Read more",

I’ll go with ‘caffeinated’ I think. Like the Adult Swim cartoons it reminded me of, it’s got a sense of the sardonic and a penchant for violence, but still comes from a place of having recently devoured several bowls of suspiciously colorful cereal.

          "description": "Andariel is the latest Uber boss to join all the other summonable ones in Diablo 4 Season 4. He’ll appear at level 100, joining Lilith and Duriel to be the highest-level bosses at the base level. If you want to know how to summon Andariel in Diablo 4, here’s how.\n\n\nThere are a few steps to do this, so we’ll lay out those requirements for Andariel, like dungeons, World Bosses, and the like. \n\n\nHow to summon Andariel in Diablo 4\n\n\nTo summon Andariel in Diablo 4, you have to unlock World Tier 4, go to the Hanged Man’s Hall, and use two Pincushioned Dolls and two Sandscorched Shackles.\n\n\nSo first, start with getting to World Tier 4. Level your character high enough to clear the Capstone Dungeon, the Fallen Temple, at the Chambatar Ridge area of the Dry Steppes region. \n\n\nWith World Tier 4 unlocked, you now have to collect the items needed to summon Andariel at the Hanged Man’s Hall. These two items have some different sources, so here they are:\n\n\n\nSandscorched Shackles (x2, x6 for Tormented)\n\nWorld Bosses, Lord Zir\n\n\n\n\nPincushioned Doll (x2, x6 for Tormtented)\n\nWorld Bosses, The Beast in the Ice\n\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nWhile World Bosses can be farmed a bit more frequently, they aren’t the most consistent. It’s best to farm the actual bosses that drop the components to summon Andariel. So, here are the resources to get those bosses:\n\n\n\nLord Zir (need 5 for a summon)\n\nElites, Events, Treasure Goblins, Whisper Caches, Hellborne, and Blood Maiden\n\n\n\n\nThe Beast in the Ice (need 9 for a summon)\n\nElites, Events, Treasure Goblins, Whisper Caches, Hellborne, Blood Maiden, and Tier 30+ Dungeons\n\n\n\n\n\nAndariel loot pool, rewards for the Diablo 4 boss\n\n\nThe possible loot you receive from Andariel is the same as when you fight Duriel. That means you have another source to receive Uber Uniques from. Their drop rates are the same, but if you are missing some Duriel parts, you can alternate and use some for Andariel.\n\nThe post How to summon Andariel in Diablo 4 appeared first on Destructoid.",

But history could have been much different. Back when the series was originally pitched, Sega \"flat-out rejected\" it.\n\n\nIn an interview (via Automaton) with Like a Dragon series creator Toshihiro Nagoshi, the former series head recalled the time Sega smacked the idea off the table like a curmudgeonly cat. According to Nagoshi, Sega was desperately seeking new video game ideas with worldwide appeal. \n\n\n\"This led to a mindset of making games that would appeal to the masses, games that could sell anywhere and to anyone.

Either way, today game director Quinn Duffy has said via Linkedin that the team at Intercept are out of a job as of June 28.\n\n\nIt’s pretty frustrating. When previously asked directly about the status of Roll7 (developer of the acclaimed OlliOlli World and Rollerdrome) and Intercept Games (Kerbal Space Program 2) during an interview with IGN, Zelnick stated, “We didn't shutter those studios, to be clear.”\n\n\nDespite the choice of words, this seems hardly clear.

          "description": "Even if you don't know much about the band Slipknot, it's nearly impossible that reading the name doesn't immediately make the images of various immensely cool and gruesome masks flash in front of your eyes. These masks aren't just bought in a secret section of a Halloween store than only metal musicians have access to. They are are designed by, among other wizards of gore, this man called Jim Ojala.\n\n\nOjala stepped out of his comfort zone - Hell, I'm assuming - to accept Atlus' challenge and create masks based on a few characters from the upcoming Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance. You can witness the process and the results below:\n\n\n\n\nOjala explains the steps of his process, which is great, but some of the results look just too good for the common mortal to achieve. Gurulu's mask, for example, looks like it's made from the actual skull of a fantastical creature that Ojala just captured and butchered somewhere. It's neat, and wise that Ojala has made this cool video to prove his demon-slaying innocence.\n\n\nLoup-Garou's mask also looks cool, probably the most Slipknot-ish one of the bunch, as it looks like a spicier version of your regular Werewolf. The coolest takeaway for me, however, is that some of his masks look even scarier on the inside. Check out how Daemon's insides provide just the perfect blueprint for an evil version of Sonic The Hedgehog:\n\n\nImage via Atlus\n\n\nYou will be able to experience Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance, when it comes out on June 14 for Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

The dregs of humanity hang onto life and go to war over the remaining food, fuel, and shelter. The humans in Mad Max also spend a good chunk of their time creating spike-covered vehicles that can patrol the wastes and duke it out in high speed battles.

Many players have been stuck in offline mode and have yet to find a reason why. But fear not; we're here to guide you on what this could mean and possible fixes.\n\n\nMultiversus stuck in offline mode, explained\n\n\nOne of the primary reasons you may find yourself stuck in Multiversus' offline mode is due to an age restriction. If your WB Games account is under 18, you can only access certain features, which keeps you offline. This restriction is likely in place to prevent younger players from making in-game purchases.\n\n\nImage via Player First Games\n\n\nIt's important to note that you can't change your age directly in-game, as this feature seems to be tied to your WB Games account. Additionally, if you haven't updated the game file, you may encounter this issue. Multiversus was initially set to offline mode before its full release, so installing the necessary updates is crucial. This method is mostly catered towards those who have previously installed the game during its Early Access.  \n\n\nIt's important to remember that Multiversus is still in its early stages, and errors like this are more common at this phase. That said, it could mean that servers are currently down when attempting to join online. Follow the Multiversus page to stay updated on issues, including server downtimes.\n\n\nIf all else fails, check to see if your internet connection is stable. LAN connections work best, too, to help with laggy performances.\n\nThe post Why is my Multiversus in offline mode? appeared first on Destructoid.",

Diablo 4 became the first Activision Blizzard title to join subscription service in March, and players started speculating which franchise would be next. As rumors intensified, Microsoft reportedly had internal debates about putting Call of Duty on Game Pass because there was a risk it would hurt the revenue generated by yearly releases. \n\n\nPlaying games on day one requires an Ultimate Game Pass subscription, which costs $16.99 monthly. Call of Duty games typically cost $69.99 or $99.99, depending on which version you purchase. The cost discrepancy forced Microsoft to weigh the benefits of each option, but a choice has now been made. \n\n\nIs Call of Duty Black Ops 6 on Xbox Game Pass?\n\n\nImage via Activision\n\n\nMicrosoft confirmed that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will be available on day one with an Xbox Game Pass subscription. As for the rumored price increase, Microsoft did not mention a new price for the subscription service in the press release. \n\n\nActivision plans on sharing a first look at Call of  Duty: Black Ops 6 gameplay during the upcoming direct event on June 9 at 10 AM PST. The series of teaser videos has already hinted at it. Still, the next Call of Duty will reportedly be set in the Gulf War, “with a strong focus on the CIA,” and rumors suggest that Black Ops 6 will launch in late October.\n\nThe post Is Call of Duty Black Ops 6 on Xbox Game Pass? appeared first on Destructoid.",

Listen!\n\n\nWhen did LEOG builds get so expensive?

It's a bit too steep for me, even though it would look pretty nifty as a piece on my shelf.\n\n\nThose who pre-order by June 7 will also get a free Water Park gift, which absolutely does not fit with the theme of The Legend of Zelda or the Great Deku Tree, but hey, more LEGO I guess.\n\n\nThe Great Deku Tree confirms long-withstanding rumors that LEGO was indeed working on a Zelda set.

Editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard do just that, exploring Marcus' custom dungeon to show off some of the game's toolset before playing a (far superior) community creation. \n\n\nHead over to Game Informer's YouTube channel for more previews, reviews, and discussions of new and upcoming games.

The Polish politician and karate master will bolster the roster this summer.\nFirst introduced as a DLC fighter in Tekken 7: Fated Retribution, Lidia is the prime minister of Poland and a practitioner of traditional karate. The formal and proud fighter clashes with fellow karate practisioner Jin Kazama in the trailer and humbles the arrogant Reina by dishing out her new Rage Art. \n\n\nLidia follows on the heels of Eddy Gordo as the two revealed Year 1 season pass fighters. Owners of Tekken 8’s Deluxe, Ultimate, or Collector's Editions automatically receive these fighters. Each can also be purchased individually for $7.99. Two more fighters remain in the Year 1 pass, who will be added during the fall and winter\nFor more on Tekken 8, check out our review.",

          "description": "One of the biggest reasons Xbox acquired Activision Blizzard was for the Call of Duty series, a first-person shooter that has dominated the best-selling games list for decades. This would make it the perfect candidate to launch on Xbox Game Pass, Microsoft's gaming subscription service, in order to bring new subscribers in. Black Ops 6 was officially revealed last week, and while it was reported to be in consideration for a Game Pass launch, today, the news was confirmed from Xbox itself. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will launch on Game Pass day one.\nWe don't know much about the game yet, but two live-action teasers have been released so far. The first features a group of people covering the faces of Mount Rushmore with blindfolds that say, \"The truth lies.\" The second, released today, can be seen below.\n\n\nIt features world leaders' black and white camera footage speaking in hushed tones about a grand conspiracy about manufactured wars and the elusive nature of the truth. The trailer ends with the game's full title, along with a reminder that the full reveal will come on June 9, after Xbox's summer showcase.\nFor more Call of Duty, check out our reviews for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III and Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War.",

It met great success and charted in what was then only a burgeoning mobile game ecosystem. Canabalt popularized the infinite runner genre and would ultimately put its designer, Adam Saltsman, on the map.\nNow working under the name of Finji as its creative director, Adam’s rise as a designer as well as his partner’s, Bekah Saltsman, as both a publisher and CEO, has been stunning to watch, especially considering the simplicity of that first big hit.

Following that March reveal, developer A Heartful of Games and publisher Outright Games has largely gone quiet. Today, the publisher revealed what players can expect from the Deluxe and Collector's Editions of Mutants Unleashed if they want to splurge on the game when it arrives later this year.\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed allows you to take control of the four turtles in a 3D brawler/platformer for up to two players. The premium editions of the game will provide additional physical goodies for fans of the franchise. The Deluxe Edition includes the game, an exclusive steelbook, four pin badges, four keychains, and an artbook. Meanwhile, the Collector's Edition includes the game, Season Pass, pizza van statue, LED sign, five pin badges, four patches, a mouse mat, notebook, pen, artbook, poster, stickers, and a collector's box. The Deluxe Edition retails for $60, while the Collector's Edition will set you back $200.\nOddly enough, both the Deluxe and Collector's Editions are exclusive to the PlayStation 5 and Switch versions of the game. If you're not planning to experience this title on those systems, but still want to at least play through the game, you're in luck, as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleahsed arrives on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC later this year.\nFor more on Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in video games, be sure to read our in-depth feature on the history of the video game franchise here, and if you want something else to look forward to, read a comment from TMNT co-creator Kevin Eastman on the upcoming video game based on The Last Ronin here.",

While the prime example on everyone's mind is likely Xbox's recent acquisition of Activision Blizzard, several have already occurred in 2024. The latest was announced today by Atari, which confirmed it is acquiring its longtime rival, Intellivision.\nAtari announced it has purchased the Intellivision brand and more than 200 games from Intellvision Entertainment. As part of the deal, Intellivision Entertainment will rebrand and continue developing and distributing the Amico game console with a license from Atari to distribute new versions of Intellivision games on the console. Atari will also look to expand digital and physical distribution of legacy Intellivision games, potentially create new games, and explore licensing opportunities. \n\"This was a very rare opportunity to unite former competitors and bring together fans of Atari, Intellivision, and the golden age of gaming,\" chairman and CEO of Atari Wade Rosen said in a press release. \n\"Atari has been a valuable partner and we have every confidence they will be a responsible steward of the storied Intellvision brand,\" CEO of Intellivision Entertainment Phil Adam said. \"We look forward to our expanded collaboration and bringing a broad array of new Atari and Intellivision titles to the Amico and Amico Home family gaming platforms.\"\nAtari has been experiencing a bit of a re-emergence in the public consciousness lately. In addition to other acquisitions, such as Nightdive Studios and Digital Eclipse, Atari has also published well-received games like Mr. Run and Jump and Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration. For more on Atari's outlook and current strategy, be sure to listen to a 2023 episode of All Things Nintendo, which featured an in-depth conversation with Wade Rosen right here.",

Druckmann is expectedly vague about Naughty Dog's next big project but offers an enticing tease, saying, \"I'm eager to see how this new game resonates, especially following the success of The Last of Us, as it could redefine mainstream perceptions of gaming.\"\nThe interview, however, primarily focuses on technology and how it improves and makes it easier for creators to tell unique stories. Regarding AI, Druckmann says, \"AI is really going to revolutionize how content is being created, although it does bring up some ethical issues we need to address. With technologies like AI and the ability to do motion capture right from home, we're reducing both costs and technical hurdles, opening the door for us to take on more adventurous projects and push the boundaries of storytelling in games.\"\nHe also briefly touches on the future of The Last of Us TV show, citing that modern technology has allowed him to oversee the TV show's second season remotely from Los Angeles while it shoots in Canada.\nYou can read the full interview here.

Immediately following the presentation, there will be a second livestream to highlight an upcoming game in a \"beloved\" series. Today, the subject of that showcase has been revealed, and surprising no one, it's a new Call of Duty game.\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 6 is a title that might confuse some, seeing as there technically isn't a game titled Black Ops 5. This is because the fifth entry of the sub-series, which launched in 2021, was Black Ops Cold War, temporarily removing the numbered naming convention. The news was announced on social media, but was accompanied by a teaser on YouTube that seems to hint at the events of the game's campaign.\n\n\nThe 40-second clip follows a group of people sneaking onto the top of Mount Rushmore, where they place blindfolds over the eyes of the presidents carved into the mountainside. The first three blindfolds read, \"The truth lies,\" while the fourth features a three-headed wolf logo that was used in the initial redacted teaser of the game.\nThe game will be revealed in full during a presentation on Saturday, June 9, immediately following the Xbox showcase that will start at 10 AM PT/ 1 PM ET. Microsoft is reportedly debating on whether or not the launch the game on Game Pass.\nWhat are you hoping to see from the newest Call of Duty? Let us know in the comments!",

Today, Netflix released the first teaser trailer for Season 4 giving fans their first look at Hemsworth in the role.\n\n\nUnfortunately, Hemsworth doesn’t speak in the brief clip, so we still don’t know how his Geralt voice compares to Cavill’s (or the games, for that matter). But he definitely doesn’t look out of place as the White Wolf and, hopefully, won’t be too much of a distraction in this new season.\nSeason 4 is currently in production in the UK and will be filmed back-to-back with Season 5, which will also be the show's finale. It has no release date but is speculated to premiere in 2025. These last two seasons will cover the three remaining Witcher books: Baptism of Fire, The Tower of the Swallow, and Lady of the Lake. The returning cast includes Anya Chalotra (Yennifer) and Freya Allan (Ciri). \nFor more on The Witcher games, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt got its official PC mod tools this week.

This update was first announced last September and will essentially force last-gen players to migrate to current consoles to continue playing the popular shooter. \nIn a developer update, general manager David Fifield announced that the CryEngine 5.11 Update will go live on August 15. This update is treated as a “significant relaunch” that brings native PS5/Xbox Series X/S support along with a host of technical improvements. However, it also means the PS4 and Xbox One versions will become unplayable.\nThat means these players must upgrade to current hardware to continue playing their copies of the game. Crytek assures these players that if they decide to upgrade, player accounts, entitlements, and all owned DLC will transfer to the new-gen version for no extra cost. \n\n\nIn addition to technical improvements, the 5.11 Update also introduces a new map and biome. In the months leading to 5.11’s launch, Crytek plans to address community and survey feedback. That includes improved reporting systems to address cheating and toxic player behavior, design reworks tackling hunter revival, health chunks, restorations, burning down hunters, and reducing stalemates. The game is also getting a new user interface, and Crytek will continue evolving the game's recruitment and prestige progression requirements. \nHunt: Showdown first launched for Xbox and PC in 2019, with the PS4 version arriving in 2020. The PvPvE first-person shooter is set in 1865 Louisiana as players, either alone or with two or three friends, hunt supernatural bounties in the bayou while fending off other player-controlled bounty hunters. \nFor more on Crytek, you can read about the studio's next big project, Crysis 4.",

The pre-rendered trailer features no gameplay (as near as I can tell) and tells the story of Miquella and the war that sent them to the Land of Shadow. The footage hints at a location around the Lands Between that you and others will presumably visit.\n\n\nElden Ring's Shadow of the Erdtree DLC will be released on June 21 and will not be a standalone expansion. It requires ownership of the original game and will cost $39.99. A physical collector's Edition of the DLC package will also be available for $249.99 and will include a statue.

But it seems like the fallout from this recent boom in popularity hasn't died down quite yet. Thanks to a teaser shared on Fortnite's official social media pages, we know that Fallout will be coming to Fortnite pretty soon\npic.twitter.com/AKjFXVnHST\nMay 17, 2024\nThe teaser image shows power armor in a cloud of orange dust, accompanied by what appears to be some sort of industrial building. Other than that, there's not much to go on, but we can make educated guesses. For one, Fortnite's current season will end on May 24, so this is the perfect time to tease the skins that might be coming in the next battle pass. And if it's anything like the recent Avatar: The Last Airbender and Star Wars crossovers, we might see Fallout-themed mechanics or areas appear on the battle royale map itself.\nIt will almost certainly involve some sort of cosmetic pack as well, which could include characters from the games, the Amazon Prime show, or both. Thanks to the teaser, we know power armor will be making an appearance, but it's unclear whether it will be an item to equip in-game or a skin that can be unlocked or purchased.\nFor more Fortnite news, read about its recent crossover with Billie Eilish, its decision to allow players to block certain emotes, and its huge and mysterious collaboration with Disney.\nWhat are you hoping to see included in this crossover?

The first of those patches came today, and it adds a few small quality-of-life improvements.\nOur first Early Access patch for Hades II is out now on Steam and the Epic Games Store!! We're very grateful for all the feedback so far, which inspired this first set of targeted improvements and fixes.\n\n🌒Full Patch Notes: https://t.co/HDQRCANrv1 pic.twitter.com/RJO0ayFb8c\nMay 16, 2024\nThe first change comes to the sprint mechanic, a feature the original Hades did not have.

          "description": "Microsoft is reportedly planning to launch this year's Call of Duty on its Xbox Game Pass subscription service, according to The Wall Stree Journal. This follows reports in previous weeks indicating Microsoft and Xbox were mulling over whether or not to launch the next iteration in the franchise on Game Pass, out of fear it might hurt sales. \nAfter acquiring Activision Blizzard for a colossal $69 billion last year, fans and analysts have speculated about how Microsoft will handle the Call of Duty franchise moving forward. It will obviously be a big draw for Xbox Game Pass, pulling in new subscribers, but most every year, the new Call of Duty is the best-selling game of the year – save for last year, where Hogwarts Legacy took that crown – and a Game Pass launch could affect those sales numbers. \n\n\nHowever, this new report from The Wall Street Journal seemingly clears the air around that topic. \n\"Microsoft plans a major shake up of its video game sales strategy by releasing the coming installment of Call of Duty to its subscription service instead of the longtime, lucrative approach of only selling it a la carte,\" the story reads. \nOf course, things could change so we'll see what happens. It's likely we'll be learning what the next Call of Duty game is next month as part of the gaming showcase summer that includes Summer Game Fest, Ubisoft Forward, and an Xbox Games Showcase followed by a secret direct that is probably focused on Call of Duty.\n[Source: The Wall Street Journal]\nWhat setting do you hope the next Call of Duty takes place in?

          "description": "2K will reveal the next iteration of one of its biggest franchises at Summer Game Fest. Fans online are already speculating what it could be, considering some of 2K's biggest franchises are prime for a new game. \nAs for when to expect this new game, the official SGF X (formerly Twitter) account says it will be announced on June 7, during the Summer Game Fest livestream that begins at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET. That's less than a month away so we don't have to speculate too long on what this mystery iteration could be. \n2K plans to reveal the next iteration in one of 2K's biggest and most beloved franchises at @SummerGameFest on Friday, June 7. pic.twitter.com/1vyFXE2N4z\nMay 16, 2024\nWhile there are plenty of 2K franchises that fit the bill, our eyes are on three franchises: Borderlands, Mafia, and BioShock. \nThe last mainline Borderlands entry – Borderlands 3 – hit PlayStation, Xbox, and PC in 2019, and with the live-action Borderlands movie hitting theaters this August, a new game would make sense. However, we did just get New Tales From The Borderlands in 2022, if you're looking for something to play through in that universe. \nOn the Mafia front, the last mainline entry was Mafia III in 2016, although 2K released Mafia: Definitive Edition – a remake – in 2020. And we know the next Mafia game is in development, too, so it might be time for an announcement. \nBioShock has been dormant since BioShock Infinite in 2013, unless you count the 2016 remasters, and we know 2K created Cloud Chamber in 2019 to work on the next entry in the franchise. It's been almost five years since then, so SGF seems like a great moment to announce the next BioShock. Speaking of, here's what we want in a BioShock 4. \nSGF returns to Los Angeles next month, with the live showcase happening on June 7. For more, check out some of the studios, publishers, and partners to be featured during the event, and then check out Game Informer's summer gaming showcase schedule. \nWhat do you think this new iteration will be?

While the launch seemed more in reach now that we’re nearly midway through 2024, it appears we’ll have to wait another full year before playing it.\nPublisher Take-Two released its 2024 year-end financial report today (thanks, PC Gamer), in which it states that Rockstar is targeting a Fall 2025 release window for GTA VI. This timing is reiterated in a calendar of the publisher’s upcoming releases, posted below.\nRegarding GTA VI, Take-Two states, “We are highly confident that Rockstar Games will deliver an unparalleled entertainment experience, and our expectations for the commercial impact of the title continue to increase.” The game is slated to release for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. A PC version has yet to be mentioned. \nGrand Theft Auto VI takes players to a modern-day Vice City (the franchise's parody of Miami, FL) and stars two protagonists, a female inmate named Lucia and her still-unnamed criminal male partner. To say anticipation is high would be an understatement; the premiere trailer garnered over 100 million views in only 24 hours, breaking a YouTube record. \nAs we continue the long wait for Grand Theft Auto VI’s launch, check out our video of Game Informer’s two resident Florida Men reacting to the debut trailer. You can also read about Take-Two's recent closure of developers Roll7 (Rollerdrome, OlliOlli World) and Intercept Games (Kerbal Space Program 2).",

It's a fantastic game that should be welcomed with open arms as it makes its way to a new platform, but we were specifically curious about how it performs on Steam Deck. The game is not Steam Deck verified primarily because certain features are not supported on Valve's handheld, or other comparable mobile PC game platforms. However, the offline content (the single-player campaign and the expansion) has been specifically adjusted to play well on Steam Deck. You can read port studio Nixxes Software explanation here. And spending a little time with the game shows that the single-player campaign does, in fact, play well on Steam Deck. It's not without its shortcomings – a high-end PC or a PlayStation 5 are still the best ways to play the game – but Steam Deck appears to be a great way to play the game if that's your only option or you want a portable version.\nYou can check out some gameplay with commentary from myself and Wesley LeBlanc below.\n\n\nHead to Game Informer's YouTube channel for more previews, reviews, and discussions of new and upcoming games.
