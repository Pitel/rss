Its association with indie publishing label Bigmode, run by popular YouTuber Jason 'Dunkey' Gastrow, added to the excitement.\nFortunately for Gastrow and solo developer Billy Basso of Shared Memory, they have a true indie darling on their hands that not only lives up to the hype but relishes in the fact that its labyrinth of secrets aims to challenge players for years to come. Animal Well is the product of seven years of development by a single person, and we are delighted to report that the wait was worth it.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Its zany premise of broomsticking across badlands in search of delicious candy, coupled with a magical mix of coloured gem grabbing, weapon power-ups, flashy bomb attacks, and mouthy fairies, have been staples in every instalment since the beginning.\nBar one pachinko outlier, most Cotton games follow the same 2D horizontal shooting format, including 2021's Cotton Fantasy: Superlative Night Dreams. But with Panorama Cotton, a 1994 Mega Drive exclusive and one of the system’s most technically impressive titles, Success switched the action to a 3D perspective, plotting the camera behind Cotton's back. It delivered a Space Harrier-style dynamic across eye-bleedingly colourful stages, occasionally with varying paths. Despite being a graphical showcase for the system, it wasn't as critically well-received as its predecessors, never appeared overseas (until 2021), and had a famously low print run.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "I spent this morning being pseudo-profound about Animal Well and pseudo-elegaic about Tango Gameworks, so now it's time to get back to the Real Business - being a pseud on the subject of videogame gun balancing.\nThe game in question is cheery co-op shooter Helldivers 2, over which Aunty Sony recently upended a can of furious worms by abruptly insisting that Steam players have a PSN account for security reasons and so, blocking players in regions where PSN isn't available. Sony have subsequently walked back the requirement following a backlash of truly hellish proportions, though I understand that the game remains unavailable on Steam in certain regions. By comparison, Arrowhead CEO Johan Pilestedt's remarks overnight that the developers might have been \"removing the fun\" with their gun balancing seem pretty innocuous.\nRead more",

So we wanted to talk about the game, why we're enjoying it, some of the new aspects over Hades the first, and just generally go 'Ooh, this game is fun, innit?'. Not a complex podcast this week.\nJames isn't here, so Nate makes up some hardware news that's very exciting and yet disturbing, while he does have a mythology-themed mini game in the tower of jocularity. Plus: the games we've been playing this week, including a cute survival horror and RimWorld, still. Also, Nate asks me to explain what the hap was heckening with Helldivers 2, and if Joel remains safe.\nYou can listen above, or on on Spotify, iTunes, Stitcher, or Pocket Casts.

I confess, I found this response annoying - partly because I was hoping Johanas would bring up some obscure indie composer I could then namecheck at parties, and partly, because I have spent years waiting for Tango to escape Mikami's shadow after essentially announcing themselves as a Mikami fan project back in 2010. \r\n\n \nRead more",

A little further up the food chain we find \"worms\", like the Creeper that once invaded the ARPANET, and \"gophers\", a directory/client system written in 1991 for the University of Minnesota. There are computer animals spawned by branding - foxes of fire and twittering birds and the anonymous beasts that haunt the margins of Google documents. There are computer animals that are implied by the verbs we use in computing - take \"browser\", derived from the old French word for nibbling at buds and sprouts, which suggests that all modern internet searches are innately herbivorous. \r\n\n \nRead more",

He was way more online when he was younger, and is the one who got me into the games of Lucasfilm, Troika and Blizzard, but these days he plays the games he likes a lot and does not read specialist websites that tell him why he shouldn't like them. He used to play loads of League Of Legends, but the game he was most into more recently was Hades. This is because he studied Classics.\nI won't tell you how many years its been since he was at university, but for many years - and still sort of now, to be honest - \"liking Apollo\" was a key part of his personality.

It ends up as something I feel is going to be a lot more approachable for players who like the idea of massive medieval simulations but don’t care to spend time reading a Magna Carta-fat wiki to learn exactly what pop growth percentage is.

I've seen loads of vids from big FPS YouTubers pivoting to it as the next big thing, especially for the Escape From Tarkov-likers. So I gave it a whirl, both as someone who wanted to see what these more hardcore extraction shooters were like and to play a video game that worked.

Unfortunately, in its attempt to eat Escape from Tarkov’s lunch – a timely one, given that game’s self-inflicted DLC misery – it’s currently choking on the wishbone of some truly dire performance issues. Even players with tip-top graphics cards are seeing heavy stuttering while out in the field, and none of the updates released thus far, including today’s Hotfix #3, have done much to soothe it.\nSaid hotfix does include some fixes for other widespread problems, including a second attempt at preventing players from becoming headless when rejoining a server (an amusing though resilient glitch, given a previous hotfix had also tried to nix it). But having played a bit of this third patch on a usually reliable RTX 4060, there’s clearly an awful lot of work left to do before Gray Zone Warfare performs acceptably.\nRead more",

Honestly, it fits the dinky PC so well you’d have thought Supergiant had decided to make this roguelike sequel a Steam Deck game that just happened to run on desktops by accident.\nHades the first was much the same, taking to the Deck like Hercules to Augean shit, but Hades 2 barely even gives away that fact that it’s unfinished. It doesn’t crash, stutter, or hang, and there’s no point in talking about settings when it runs at a practically perfect 60fps on max quality. Make that 90fps on the Steam Deck OLED, too. It’s just a fabulous game for handhelds, even in its earliest of early access days.\nRead more",

Amongst other things, they'd reach over and flick the power off while I was playing The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening. I didn't finish that game for 15 years. I'd flown the family nest before I braved the Eagle's Tower. Can you imagine what my friends would have done if I'd owned a Game Boy Camera? Probably, they'd have taken photos of... bottoms with it, and such. \nI'm aware I'm not making a great case for being a graduate of the School of Hard Knocks. The point is: I didn't have a Game Boy Camera then, so I'm delighted that the Game Boy Camera has caught on among a later generation of indie PC developers - prominent among them artist and educator Catharine Graffam, whose GB Camera Gallery: Mystery Show you can play for free in a browser.\n Read more",

Then you watch its trailers and find surrealist imagery, genre-hopping, and a bleak sense of humour are part of its arsenal, and suddenly it seems, to me, irresistible.\r\n\nIt's out now.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's often invoked as an archetype for the humanist worldview of Man the Measure and Centre of all Things, holding a perfectly proportioned universe in shape. Rin D'Lorah, the heroine of new narrative RPG Sky Of Tides, is a bit like the Vitruvian Man, and the result is a game I find at once bewitching and powerfully offputting in its refusal to satisfy the conventions of the genre. \r\n\n \nRead more",

The answer, apparently, is: pretty good, because Styczeń has a healthy approach to early access development in keeping players close, without quite handing them the wheel.\r\n \nRead more",

Me too! Must have been the direct influence for Sea Of Thieves' new Season 12, which launched earlier this week with a bang - from two smoking barrels! Among the additions in this season of the ever popular salty sea-dog open-world adventure are double barrel pistols. They deal less damage per shot but have higher rate of fire, and you can charge them up to fire both barrels at once. \nOn the other end of the weapon scale are new throwing knives, capable of sneak attacks, light slashes, or, you know, throwing. You can nab any throwing knives you see lying around, too, which is fun. But honestly, the Bone Caller tool (the aforementioned jar of skeletons, which has a great Jason and The Argonauts vibe) and the Horn Of Fair Winds are are probably more useful. The winds from said horn can make your ship go faster, but can also put out fires or crowd control enemies, or for some reason make you swim faster? I don't think that makes sense, to be honest, but the horn has limited uses so as not to make you an unstoppable wind machine. \nRead more",

          "description": "Last week a Catholic media ministry (not sure what that is but okay) called Catholic Answers created a generative AI priest chatbot called Father Justin. Fr. Justin used a large language model to answer questions about the Catholic church and Catholic orthodoxy, and if you have any familiarity with how people love to test AI chatbots - or you read the headline of this article - then you know where this is going. Fr. Justin, who was already kind of controversial anyway, offered the sacrament and claimed to be a real priest to Futurism, and gave the thumbs up to baptising a baby in Gatorade in an emergency.\nCatholic Answers (who have the domain Catholic.com; gotta imagine His Holiness wishes he'd moved quicker on that one) then defrocked Justin, making him  a lay theologian in a suit jacket, jeans and an open collar shirt that gives him a \"me and my wife saw you across the bar\" kind of vibe, when before he had the whole dog collar kit and caboodle.\nRead more",

Those lord packs are now the three top rated expansions in the series’ history, and the base game itself saw a huge uptick in positive reviews. The last day also saw a peak player count of around 66,000, putting it ahead of giants like Palworld, Rimworld, and Fallout 76.

Softwarový gigant, kterému krutě ujížděl vlak na poli mobilních platforem si koupil telefonního giganta, kterému také krutě ujížděl vlak. Nokia skončila se Symbianem a přešla na nově vznikající systém Windows Phone. Výsledek se dostavil o 4 roky později, kdy Microsoft definitivně vydáním posledního telefonu s Windows Phone současně celou akvizici za 7 miliard dolarů odepsal a začal se soustředit na jiné cesty jak vydělávat v mobilním světě.",

          "description": "With the amount of things that go on in our missions for democracy in Helldivers 2, we don’t know too much about all the enemies. We only focus on those that kill us so many times, like Chargers and Devastators. What about the Warrior enemy? We’ll tell you what the Warrior is in Helldivers 2 and how to complete the Personal Order related to it.\n\n\nWhat is a Warrior in Helldivers 2?\n\n\nA Warrior is a common enemy when fighting the Terminids on any of the planets to the East. They look like Brood Commanders but appear grey in color. They can actually be summoned by the Commanders, making it easier to get more kills for the daily.\n\n\nTheir weak spots are under the hard carapace or on their legs. Most primary weapons can deal with them easily, with shotguns excelling at taking them out in one or two shots.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nHow to kill 35 Warriors in Helldivers 2 for the Personal Order\n\n\n35 Warrior kills might sound like a lot, but it really isn’t. Luckily, this enemy variant appears in all mission difficulties. Also, with there being a focus right now on Terminid planets because of the Major Order, you can easily farm this order in a mission or two if you’re playing on difficulty 6 or higher.\n\n\nAs long as you or someone in your squad gets the killing blow on a Warrior, it’ll count towards your Personal Order. If a Charger, Bile Titan, or Spewer kills them as collateral damage, it will not count. \n\n\nIf you want to get this done quickly, find a fast mission like Eradicate the Terminid Swarm or a Blitz, you can get this done in one or two sessions. Missions with less time will spawn more enemies, heavily increasing the chances of Warriors to spawn. Just bring proper equipment to deal with other headaches the Swarm throws at you. \n\nThe post What is a Warrior in Helldivers 2?

In this guide, we'll focus on V Rising's Brutal Difficulty to give you an idea of what to expect. \n\n\nWhat is Brutal Difficulty in V Rising?\n\n\nBrutal mode is the most challenging Difficulty setting in V Rising, primarily reserved for veteran players. If you've already mastered the game's world, this mode offers a fresh, intense experience. V Blood bosses have evolved, forcing Vampires to change up the strategies they established in Early Access. \n\n\nImage via Stunlock Studios\n\n\nThe mode is not just about increased difficulty; it's about strategic mastery. V Blood Bosses now have a variety of moves on the battlefield, and their health and damage rates have also been amped up. With their higher levels, they'll pose a significant challenge, demanding careful planning and execution. Enemies, in general, are going to be brutal, with damage rates boosted all around. \n\n\nWhile Brutal mode may appear daunting, Stunlock Studios has included several advantageous features. You can anticipate more frequent loot drops and slower item durability depletion. Of course, enemy forces will still be difficult to handle, but the improved materials will provide a solid foundation for survival. \n\n\nHosts can embark on Brutal Difficulty mode whenever they are setting up a server. Various modes are available here, such as PvE and PvP Squad servers. Relaxed and Normal settings are also available if you ever want to take a breather at any point. While Relaxed primarily focuses on exploration and building, Normal features a balanced experience with much more combat. \n\nThe post V Rising Brutal Difficulty, explained appeared first on Destructoid.",

These new camos are unlockable in-game by anyone, not for purchase. So when you see someone with a shiny gold-leafed gun you've never seen before, here's how to unlock it yourself.\n\n\nHow to get weapon prestige camos unlocked\n\n\nScreenshot from Destructoid\n\n\nWeapon prestige camos in Modern Warfare 3 are unlocked by doing one thing: using a gun a lot. The only way to get the one available camo right now is to earn a tremendous amount of XP with a single weapon. Doing so will unlock the camo just for that weapon. Unfortunately, that means you'll have to earn that XP repeatedly for every weapon you want the camo on. \n\n\nThe 'One Trick' gold camo can be found and tracked under the 'Weapon Prestige' tab while viewing a weapon's camo options. It's unlocked by completing a challenge, which is to earn 150,000 weapon XP. Though it sounds like a lot, if you play the game fairly often and always use the same weapon, it won't take too long. Unlocking it for every other weapon, however, might be a bit of a grind.\n\n\nCan you unlock the classified weapon prestige camos?\n\n\nWhile viewing the weapon prestige camos for a weapon, you can see there are a few more listed. Though each one is blocked out with 'Classified' written over it. When hovering over each of these options, it says they'll become available in future seasons. It looks like we'll get a single weapon prestige camo per season, as one says Season 4, another Season 5, and so on. \n\n\nFor now, the One Trick weapon prestige camo is the only one you can earn by getting 150,000 XP per weapon. XP is earnable faster by completing challenges with the weapon of your choosing, which includes challenges for other camos on each weapon, if you don't already have them all. \n\nThe post How to unlock weapon prestige camos in Modern Warfare 3 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Ten years on and the Elder Scrolls Online still has a healthy player count and is getting frequent updates and improvements as the team at Zenimax Online continues to put their fingerprints all over Tamriel. If you’re thinking of getting into it with friends, you might wonder if it’s cross platform.\n\n\nNo, not really.\n\n\nI’m basing this off the definition that cross platform means that players on PC can interact with ones on the game’s two console releases. That’s not possible. However, you can play with players on other systems in the same console family.\n\n\nThat is to say, if you have the PlayStation 5 version, you can play with someone who is using a PlayStation 4. Likewise, Xbox Series X|S players can still interact with the Xbox One player base, and PC can play with Mac.\n\n\nHowever, PC gamers can’t play with PlayStation users, and PlayStation people don’t inhabit the same world as those on Xbox.\n\n\nDoes Elder Scrolls Online have cross platform progression?\n\n\nThe logical next question might be whether or not your progress carries in Elder Scrolls Online  between platforms. If you start playing on PC and find your friends prefer PS5, can you simply move over to the PS5 and still have access to your characters and unlocks?\n\n\nNo, you can’t do that either.\n\n\nWhile you can sign into ESO using the same account on all platforms, that’s merely for login purposes. Progress is, once again, locked to one family of platforms (PS4/PS5, Xbox One/Series X|S, PC/Mac). Crowns, experience, and purchased items are locked to where they were originally granted.\n\n\nOn top of that, it isn’t possible to transfer characters between platforms. Even if you submit a ticket to Zenimax, the staff there are unable to move characters across servers or platforms, even in the back end. You’re stuck with the platform you choose.\n\nThe post Is Elder Scrolls Online cross platform in 2024? appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The monstrous Hollows harness a unique ability to transform into the Arrancar. This technique opens various Cero paths, each providing a unique power. Here is the best Cero path to use in Type Soul. \n\n\nWhat is the best Cero path in Type Soul?\n\n\nOf all the abilities, Cero Cornea is the best Cero path in Type Soul due to its heavy damage rates and versatile range. When active, players can move a circular radius to anywhere they desire, blasting the enemies into oblivion on impact. It can be placed up close or at a distance, perfect for any scenario.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nFollowing closely behind the Cero Cornea is the Tri-Cero. This power illuminates the battlefield with its three lethal beams, inflicting damage on the left, right, and center positions. It covers a significant portion of the area and can be even more devastating when combined with Kendo powers (similar to Cero Cornea). \n\n\nType Soul Cero path tier list\n\n\nWe've compiled a tier list for a comprehensive view of all Cero paths in Type Soul. This list ranks the Cero paths based on their effectiveness and versatility, providing you with a guide to choosing the best path for your playstyle.\n\n\nS Tier\n\n\n\nCero Cornea\n\n\nTri-Cero\n\n\n\nA Tier\n\n\n\nCero Grab\n\n\n\nB Tier\n\n\n\nBlade Cero\n\n\n\nC Tier\n\n\n\nFinger Cero\n\n\n\nWhile Tri-Cero and Cero Cornea dominate the field, the other Cero paths cater to specific playstyles, offering a variety of choices. For instance, Cero Grab is a boon for melee users, allowing them to seize an enemy and deliver a fiery blow. On the other hand, Blade Cero is a precision striker's dream, unleashing a brutal attack in a single line. \n\n\nEven if Finger Cero is in the C tier, it can still be considered one of the best paths to use in Type Soul. Its speed and counters make up for its weaker damage rates. You'll likely need to practice around with Finger Cero to get the hang of it, giving you more power in the palm of your hands. \n\nThe post Best Cero path in Type Soul appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Hades 2 can be a bit weird about its resources since you’re never guaranteed to see them in a single run. Because their appearance is somewhat random, multiple runs could leave you still unclear about where to find certain things. G Rock, an item needed to create the Argent Skull weapon is one such example.\n\n\nTo be clear, “G Rock” isn’t what the resource is actually called. It’s Glassrock. As of right now, when listed as an ingredient, some items get abbreviated. It’s just kind of strange that the most important qualifier in the name was what squished down so much.\n\n\nIn any case, Glassrock is a mineral, which means that, just like silver, you need the Crescent Pick to extract. You almost certainly have it by now.\n\n\nYou find Glassrock (G Rock) in the Fields of Mourning, which is the third area on the descent route. This means you will need to be able to handle Hecate, as well as Scylla and the Sirens.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThe good news is that once you reach the Fields of Mourning, Glassrock is hardly a rare resource. The bad news is that the areas are, true to their name, largely wide open areas where it’s easy to overlook something. If you have done the Reagent Sensing incantation, that helps, as it will point you in the direction of any resources once you’ve cleared the area.\n\n\nYou’re probably familiar with resources by now, so Glassrock (G Rock) looks like sharp, black rocks. They have a shine to them which signifies that they’re harvestable, but because of their dull color, they can be easy to overlook.\n\n\nOnce you have Glassrock, the most obvious usage for it is to create the Argent Skull. However, afterward, you’ll also find that G Rock is important in creating some of the Aspects, such as the Aspect of Thanatos and the Aspect of Artemis. For now, it might be best to just stock up, which means taking the crescent pick with you to the Fields of Mourning.\n\nThe post Hades 2 G Rock location appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Stray Gods: The Role-Playing Musical, a creative and ambitious attempt to fuse musical theatre with interactive fiction, launched last August, but that's not the last time fans will get to experience that modern take on Greek myth. Announced today at LudoNarraCon, the game is getting DLC called Stray Gods: Orpheus, which follows the titular character through a new adventure. Check out the reveal trailer below.\n\n\nOrpheus (played by Rent star Anthony Rapp) appeared in the base game, but only briefly, so this expansion will give players a better idea of his backstory and personality. The trailer also features Hermes (played by Erika Ishii), though their exact role in the DLC isn't clarified. The experience is roughly two hours long with six new interactive tracks and features some returning songwriters, including Austin Wintory, Simon Hall, and Montaigne, but also adds comedic musician Tom Cardy to the mix.\nAs for the plot, the following excerpt from a press release explains what to expect. \"When the curtain has fallen and the show is over, who do you go home as?\" it reads. \"Choose to reject, embrace, or rewrite the stories the world expects of you. Is the mortal world ready for the return of Ancient Greece’s most infamous bard?\"\n\nStray Gods: Orpheus hits PC on June 27, with a console release date \"coming soon.\" For more Stray Gods, check out our feature on how it was made.

          "description": "More cuts at Xbox are reportedly on the way, with some staff at ZeniMax getting offered voluntary severance agreements this week. This news comes from a Bloomberg report that says employees across the Xbox organization have been told to expect more cuts. \nThese potential layoffs would follow Xbox's decision to shutter four Bethesda studios earlier this week, including Hi-Fi Rush team Tango Gameworks and Redfall developer Arkane Austin. As for the staff offered voluntary severance agreements, Bloomberg reports that producers, quality assurance testers, and other staff at ZeniMax are receiving them. \n\n\nThe publication also reports the reason Tango Gameworks and Arkane Austin were shut down this week is that they were in the process of pitching new projects and hiring additional staff for said projects, something suggested by ZeniMax head Jill Braff and Xbox president Matt Booty during a town hall held this week. Xbox and ZeniMax chose to shut these studios down – both in the beginning processes of creating new games – instead of closing a studio deeper in development on projects. \nElsewhere in Bloomberg's report, which details an internal town hall held at Xbox following the studio closures this week, Booty reportedly described its studios as spread too thin, like \"peanut butter on bread,\" and that leaders across the company felt understaffed. Xbox closed three studios and had ZeniMax Online Studios absorb Roundhouse Games to free up resources. Braff said during the meeting, \"It's hard to support nine studios all across the world with a lean central team with an ever-growing plate of things to do. I think we were about to topple over.\" \nThese studio closures follow the January layoffs of 1,900 employees at Xbox, Activision Blizzard, and ZeniMax, which add to the total of more than 10,000 laid off in the games industry just this year. \n[Source: Bloomberg]\nHow do you feel about Xbox?

However, its release arrives at a rocky period for Xbox, which just shuttered four Bethesda studios, including Hi-Fi Rush team Tango Gameworks and Redfall developer Arkane Austin. As a result, Xbox players have wondered how safe Hellblade II developer Ninja Theory might be after its sequel's release, given Hi-Fi Rush was a \"break out hit\" for the company but wasn't enough to keep Tango open. \nPerhaps to help boost Hellblade II's sales, Xbox is reportedly considering bringing the game to PlayStation 5, according to The Verge. The publication's Tom Warren writes, \"I understand Hellblade II is another game that Microsoft has been considering for the PS5. If that ever happens, at this point, it's not clear if even that would be considered a success.\" \n\n\nHellblade II coming to PS5 wouldn't be out of left field, considering Xbox has brought previously exclusive games like Grounded, Sea of Thieves, and Hi-Fi Rush to PS5 this year. However, with the launch of Hellblade II happening in just a few weeks, it seems if it does come to PS5, it will be post-launch, which lines up with Xbox's strategy in this realm thus far. \nSenua's Saga: Hellblade II hits Xbox Series X/S and PC on May 21, 2024. \nFor more about the game, check out the Senua's Saga: Hellblade II PC specs and system requirements, and then read about how Senua's Saga: Hellblade II will be locked to 30 FPS on Xbox Series X/S. After that, read about how the game will have a photo mode at launch. \n[Source: The Verge]\nDo you hope Xbox brings Senua's Saga: Hellblade II to PS5? Let us know in the comments below!",

Even better, Mark Hamill is voicing the Clown Prince of Crime once more.\nThough we don’t see gameplay, a cinematic trailer sets up a dramatic confrontation (and likely emotional reunion for fans) between Batman, voiced in the game by the late Kevin Conroy, and his archnemesis. \n\n\nThis marks the first game to feature both Batman: The Animated Series actors together as their respective characters since 2018’s Lego DC Super Villans. Conroy passed away in 2022, and prior to 2024's Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, MultiVersus was the final game to feature his Batman performance. Following his death, Hamill had alluded to retiring the Joker role for good. However, dataminers uncovered Joker’s existence in MultiVersus in 2022 and found audio files revealing Hamill’s performance. This means he likely recorded his lines before Conroy’s passing. \nJoker is the first new character to join the existing line-up of fighters, but he won't be the last. We're curious to see who else joins the fray after MultiVersus re-launches on May 28 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.",

          "description": "Arkane Austin was reportedly set to release a big Redfall update this month that would have added offline play to the always-online game before Microsoft suddenly shut the studio down, according to IGN. This follows yesterday's news that Microsoft was shutting down Arkane Austin, Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks, Mighty Doom studio Alpha Dog Games, and absorbing Roundhouse Games into ZeniMax Online Studios.\nThis offline play update would have addressed one of players' biggest complaints with the game – that Redfall always requires a connection to the internet – but now that update will never see the light of day. It's an especially concerning detail considering now that Arkane Austin is closed, the day when Redfall servers are no longer live, rendering the game unplayable, seems closer than ever before. \n\n\nIGN also reports that it was told the now-canceled Hero Pass, which would have added two additional playable characters to Redfall, was scheduled for release around Halloween. It obviously won't be released now – Bethesda says those who purchased the Hero Pass will be eligible \"to receive the value of the upgrade\" – but if it had hit the game around Halloween, that would have been roughly 18 months after Redfall's launch. \nRedfall hit Xbox Series X/S and PC on May 2 to poor reviews from critics – read Game Informer's review here – and players alike, and the first-person multiplayer vampire shooter failed to recover, with Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer saying, \"I'm upset with myself,\" when asked about its launch.\nAccording to reports, some of Arkane Austin's staff hoped Microsoft might cancel Redfall or reboot it as a single player game, following the former's acquisition of ZeniMax Media in 2020 for $7.5 billion. Arkane Austin director Harvey Smith said Microsoft canceled a PlayStation 5 version of Redfall following this acquisition. \n[Source: IGN]\nHow do you feel about Microsoft shutting down Arkane Austin?

          "description": "The success of Marvel Snap rolls on, as does the seasonal structure of the free-to-play, deck-building card-battler from Second Dinner. Recent seasons have been themed after corners of the Marvel Universe, like Avengers vs. X-Men or Thunderbolts, but this season leans a bit more into the Marvel Multiverse with Blink and the Exiles. This season, titled \"A Blink in Time,\" introduces five new characters, two new locations, and more.\nThe new characters joining the game in A Blink in Time are as follows:\nBlink (5 Cost, 7 Power)\n\n\t\nOn reveal, swap the last card you played with a higher-cost card from your deck.\n\n\t\nNocturne (3 Cost, 5 Power)\n\t\nYou can move this once. When this moves, replace its location with a random new one.\n\n\t\nSage (3 Cost, 0 Power)\n\t\nOn reveal, +2 power for each different power among all other cards here.\n\n\t\nNamora (5 Cost, 6 Power)\n\t\nOn reveal, give +5 power to each of your cards alone at another location.\n\n\t\nSasquatch (6 Cost, 10 Power)\n\t\nCosts 1 less for each card you played last turn.\n\n                  \n\nOn top of those all-new characters joining Marvel Snap collections, there are two new locations: Panoptichron, where cards that didn't start in your deck get +2 power, and Cancun, where power at that location doesn't count toward winning the game. New albums featuring Dan Hipp and Rian Gonzales also further incentivize Variant collections by rewarding items themed after Werewolf By Night, Silk, and Iron Lad. Finally, we know the dates of the Series 5 releases of this season. Baron Zemo and Nocturne get their Series 5 release on May 7, Sage arrives on May 14, Namora on May 21, and Sasquatch on May 28.\nMarvel Snap's May season, A Blink in Time, kicks off today.

This news arrives at the same time Nintendo has revealed it will announce the Switch successor by March 2025, meaning there's still some time for the Switch to catch up to Nintendo's best-selling console: the Nintendo DS. \nSince the last financial results call, the Switch has sold an additional 1.96 million units, bringing its grand total up to 141.32. That keeps it in second place, only behind the Nintendo DS' massive 154.02 million. It's possible the Switch surpasses the Nintendo DS, especially considering the Switch will likely continue to sell even once its successor is released, but that's a big 13 million-unit gap to close. \n\n\nElsewhere in the financial results, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has hit 20.28 million units sold, Super Mario Bros. Wonder has sold through 11.96 million, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe another 6.79 million, and Pikmin 4 3.33 million. The fiscal year ending with March 2024 was a strong one for Switch software, selling 163.95 million units in Q1 through Q3 of Fiscal Year 2024. However, compared to the same quarters for Fiscal Year 2023, Switch software is down 4.7%. \nWith the Switch successor on the horizon, that number will likely be way up this time next year. \nIn the meantime, read about the Nintendo Direct happening next month, and then check out Game Informer's top 10 Switch games.

However, the company says there will be no mention of this successor during a Nintendo Direct it is holding in June; this Direct will instead be focused on the games coming to Switch in the second half of 2024. \nWhile this isn't the first hint of a Switch successor from the company, it is the most direct and comes from the same financial results where we learned the Switch has sold an additional 1.96 million units since the last one, bringing its total up to 141.32 million.

Oceanus is generally more difficult to navigate than Erebus, the first area, due to explosive hazards, more powerful ranged enemies, and darting schools of swordfish. The level culminates in a musical boss fight against a rock band of sirens led by Scylla, a well-known sea monster from Greek myth. Scylla sings while her keyboardist and drummer back her up. Despite sharing one health bar, the individual monsters can be stunned and knocked out of the fight, muting the appropriate instruments in the active music track.\nSee Oceanus And The Scylla Boss Fight In Action:\n\n\nHead to Game Informer's YouTube channel for more previews, reviews, and discussions of new and upcoming games.

After playing several hours of the Early Access build (which is publicaly available as of today), we traveled to Supergiant Games' studio in San Francisco to interview several of the core team members – creative director Greg Kasavin, studio director Amir Rao, art director Jen Zee, composer Darren Korb, and voice actor Logan Cunningham – to get the full story of the game's creation. The cover story reveals why Supergiant decided to create its first sequel, how it chose a new protagonist in Zagreus' sister, Melinoë, along with her mythological origins, and how the team is changing its approach to early access and the content it has planned for the future. It also features an in-depth breakdown of Hades II's new features and our impressions …",

However, a PSN account will be required to play through Ghost of Tsushima's multiplayer Legends mode, or if you want to use the new PlayStation PC overlay to acquire trophies and more. \nThis follows news from last week where PlayStation announced (and later walked back) that Helldivers 2 players will soon be required to link a PSN account to their Steam account, leading to widespread anger in the game's community. It seems Sucker Punch is looking to get ahead of this by revealing its PSN plans ahead of the game's launch in 10 days. \nThank you for your feedback.\nMay 3, 2024\nIf you're unfamiliar with Ghost of Tsushima: Legends, it's a standalone multiplayer experience that allows you and up to three other players to fight enemies in special missions, defeat waves of foes, and complete raids. A PSN account will be required to play Legends, but if you want to play through the game's story (and Iki Island expansion), you won't need one. \nGhost of Tsushima hit PlayStation 4 on July 17, 2020, before launching on PlayStation 5 with a Director's Cut on August 20, 2021. This is the version of the game hitting PC in 10 days on May 16, 2024.\nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Ghost of Tsushima review, and then read about why the Director's Cut of Ghost of Tsushima is a must-play for fans. \n[Source: VideoGamesChronicle]\nAre you going to play Ghost of Tsushima on PC?

Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days.

The studio’s two founders are the only remaining employees.\nFounders Keon Deetman (CEO) and Paul Deetman (managing director) announced on social media that after the studio failed to secure funding during the Game Developer’s Conference (GDC) in March, it had “exhausted all our possible options for publishing, work for hire, and co-development.” As a result, the remainder of its staff has been let go. GameIndustry.biz confirmed that 13 employees were affected, 11 of which were full-time and 2 freelance contractors. \nThe Deetmans have made a call for any studios with open positions to hire its affected staff. The founders plan to stay in business and have vowed to rebuild, which includes launching a Kickstarter to crowdfund Deliver Us Home,  a sequel to Deliver Us Mars. \nIt was clear Keoken was in trouble when the founders posted a video in March revealing it had been unable to land a publishing deal after spending two years pitching five games to over 40 publishers. Instead, the founders decided to publicly reveal these projects to help garner interest, one of which was Deliver Us Home and two were Deliver Us The Moon spin-offs, including a VR game. \nKeoken once employed 45 employees, but the headcount was reduced to 20 by March 2024 before four more employees were let go that month. In an interview with GameIndustry.biz, the Deetmans revealed they had gone months without collecting a salary to help stay afloat.",

In it, the company confirms the land will have three rides, including the Donkey Kong Mine Cart Madness coaster that's expected to open later this year in Osaka, Japan's Super Nintendo World. \nThe video includes digital fly-overs of the park, showing viewers what it will look like when it opens next year. If you've seen Super Nintendo World in Japan, this park looks nearly identical, with both the Donkey Kong Country (and mine cart coaster) section and the Mushroom Kingdom with Peach's Castle, Mt. Beanpole, the Mario Kart: Bowser's Challenge augmented-reality ride and Yoshi's Adventure dark ride. \nCheck it out for yourself in the new Super Nintendo World overview video below: \n\n\nAs you can see, the Donkey Kong Mine Cart Madness coaster will feature state-of-the-art track technology that allows it to create the illusion that riders will actually jump off the tracks, just like in the Donkey Kong Country games. \nLike in Hollywood's Super Nintendo World, which does not have the Yoshi's Adventure ride or the Donkey Kong expansion as a result of space at the location, and Osaka's Super Nintendo World, guests can purchase Power-Up Bands to play in interactive Key Challenges to earn coins and more. Plus, returning locations like the Toadstool Cafe restaurant and more will be at Orlando's iteration of the park. \nHere's a look at some of the locations to expect when Universal Epic Universe opens next year: \n\nFor more details about the park, read Game Informer's breakdown of everything coming to Epic Universe next year. After that, check out photos from our visit to Japan's Super Nintendo World, and then watch this vlog of our day at the theme park. \nAre you excited for Epic Universe and Orlando's Super Nintendo World?
