Many musical composers take heavy inspiration from their favourite music, sometimes on purpose, sometimes without even realising it. It's called interpolation, and it's a common musical technique in which a musician uses borrowed melodies to craft their own song. It's functionally different from sampling, which is taking a direct sample from another song, and more importantly, it's not stealing!\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The big story is that the PlayStation 5 has outsold all Switch models to be the best-selling hardware of the week of 23rd - 29th January. Sony's console sold an impressive 53,256 units this week, edging past the combined sales of the Switch OLED, the normal Switch, and the Lite (51,108).\nMore on those console sales in a bit, however. In terms of the software charts, the Switch has dominated as usual, and we have another new number one this week.

Chief amongst these is the hope for some Zelda sets which, in the build up to Tears of the Kingdom, have kept the rumour mill churning over the past few months in particular.\nJust last month we heard of a Breath of the Wild set that had qualified for official review (presumably slipping in before LEGO blocked any further Zelda-themed submissions) and now we have seen yet another design that is doing the rounds on LEGO forums (thanks, Nintendo Everything). Before we dive into the details, it is worth bearing in mind that this is still heavy rumour talk.

          "description": "With the world continuing to disintegrate around us in real-time, it can be tempting to cast our eyes skyward in the hope of finding a better future. If KeokeN's Deliver Us games are anything to go by, though, life in outer space isn't all that peachy either. In Deliver Us The Moon, you may remember the scientists in charge of the moon's Earth-saving energy beam tech ended up having a bit of a Rapture moment, sabotaging all their good work (and the future of Earth in the process) and buggering off to goodness knows where to start life afresh in their newly birthed utopia. In its sequel, Deliver Us Mars, you find out those rogue astronauts didn't actually go that far at all. Yep, they hopped on over to the red planet and set up shop there, and when a strange transmission comes through revealing their location, it serves as the catalyst to send yet another crew into space to go and investigate. \r\n\nThis time, though, you're right at the heart of its central conflict. By casting players as Kathy, the daughter of one of those rogue astronauts, Deliver Us Mars tells a much more fraught and personal tale of what kind of future humanity should be pursuing: should we, in fact, be turning our efforts toward a life in outer space, or should we be doing everything in our power to try and save the dire, pretty much almost dead husk of a planet we call home? \nRead more",

Indeed, just like the 2K Launcher last year, with the added irony that the affected games (which include The Division 2, Watch Dogs Legion and Ghost Recon Breakpoint) only arrived on Steam in the past few weeks. \nRead more",

I might smugly write something like “it elevates the genre” while sipping wine and eating cheese, musing on how a game pushes the media forward as an art form. Other times I just want to write that a game is really bloody good, actually, and I like it lots.\nHi-Fi Rush falls into the latter category. Developer Tango Gameworks shadow-dropped the rhythm-action game out of nowhere shortly after an Xbox presentation, jettisoning The Evil Within’s murky mental hospitals and Ghostwire: Tokyo's supernatural shinanigans for something markedly different: bright pulsating neon colours and a gang of loveable anime ruffians, where every whack and dodge is underscored by a beat. \nHi-Fi Rush is an action-adventure game with a mechanical core fuelled by musical beats. Protagonist Chai has undergone a risky medical procedure and emerged from the other side with a robot arm and an iPod accidentally implanted in his chest meaning his every waking moment is punctuated by a catchy beat. We too see these rhythmic motions, as Hi-Fi Rush's soda pop-infused world moves to this steady pulse - platforms move in time with the music, lights flash in pleasing rhythmic patterns, and enemies attack to the beat of the drum. \nRead more",

To echo AliceB’s sentiments upon revisiting Portal, it’s fuckin’ Minecraft.\nIn fact, I think I could take her Portal revisited intro, replace every instance of “Portal” with “Minecraft”, and call it a day. It’s Minecraft! Of course it was game of the year. It was arguably the game of the decade, an absolute all timer. I won’t spend many words explaining why it is good, because those words would be redundant fodder, like the bloke fighting a soaring dragon by poking the ground under his feet with a sword. I’ll give it a fair go so that Alice can’t say I didn’t try, and swiftly move on to reading all of your (hopefully) lovely comments about why you also like Minecraft.

But Yaza Games have taken a bit of a different direction with Inkulinati's vibe by adding a whole heap of cheeky humour. You wouldn't think it would suit the stuffy nature of religious manuscripts, but actually those monks were pretty cheeky blokes, and Inkulinati's humour is done in a way that stays completely loyal to the source material, fart jokes and all.\nRead more",

          "description": "A Bloomberg report from yesterday has revealed new details on the state of the Halo franchise and the turmoil at developer 343 Industries. This news comes after 95 employees lost their jobs, following mass layoffs across Microsoft. The layoffs affected long-time 343 devs, as well as contractors who only had a few days' notice. Halo Infinite has been trying to find its footing after a rocky first year, but this report doesn’t inspire much hope from fans, at least for the series’ short-term future. The report delves into the studio’s switch to a different engine, an upcoming battle royale game, and most importantly, the lack of any single-player content in development. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Jett: The Far Shore was, like the jagged colossi that roamed its lavender skies, an odd beast. When it emerged on the Epic Game Store in the autumn of 2021, you could see the conflict roiling in its belly - between the linear science fiction short story on the surface, and the freeroaming “Metroid snowboarding game” fighting to get out from underneath it.\n“Once the story finished, I hoped an endgame would open up and allow me to play freely in its world,” I wrote in our Jett review. “That I’d have more opportunities to watch great Ghoke, the red sun, rise in real time, and to ponder the Far Shore’s fascinating mysteries at length. Instead, I could only replay previous chapters. If only Jett had embraced a rhythm as organic as its inspired ecosystem.”\r\n\n\r\nWhen the Jett team read that review, they didn’t disagree. “You put your finger on it more accurately than anybody else, which was, ‘It really feels like this is building up to some sort of systemic-focused, open world endgame,’” says Superbrothers founder Craig Adams. “And internally we were like, ‘Yeah, it is.’” What they knew, and I didn’t, was that The Far Shore was just the first part of a two-campaign story. That journey has now been completed with the launch of Given Time, a bonus 12-hour adventure that coincides with Jett’s long-awaited Steam release. \r\n\n \nRead more",

With that in mind, I dove into the game's recent technical test with fellow RPS Treehouse-dwellers Ollie and James to sample the game at a more leisurely pace, and to draw upon their greater strategic expertise. Did the combat hold up? Were they pleased to be dragged into a co-op session with me? Yes... and no. We had fun, but it didn't come quite as naturally without the guiding hand of the developers showing us the ropes.\nRead more",

There's the eldest, who will always be heaped with praise because no matter what the others achieve, she did it all first. Her twin is always keen to remind you that even though she's the younger and perhaps not quite as accomplished half of the duo, she's more charismatic and less coy about who she is and what she wants. Then there's the youngest, who's extremely likeable, in large part because she's learned what behaviours to avoid just by watching the others make mistakes; even if she's modelled herself on the eldest a bit too closely in her quest for approval, and so hasn't really forged her own identity.\nThen there's Life Is Strange 2: the awkward middle child. Still very recognisably a member of the family, but the one that stands out in all the photos because he's just a bit gawky. He's experimented a lot with his storytelling and plotline in an attempt to make himself stand out, and it's only sort-of worked. His romantic subplots are underdeveloped, his villains are one-dimensional, and his attempt at tackling a Very Serious Issue has grown in all crooked.\nRead more",

After an eight-year absence, the next entry in Ubisoft’s beloved city-building series was finally revealed in 2018, only to be delayed indefinitely two years later. The game then reemerged in a fresh new form in 2022, but a less than favourable reception from long-term fans to its closed beta saw the game delayed indefinitely once again.\r\n\n\r\n12 months later, The Settlers: New Allies is all the better for it. An extended delay is never an easy decision to make, yet the team at Ubisoft Düsseldorf (formerly Blue Byte) has seen this additional development time as an opportunity to reach out to those most familiar with the series. “We learned [more] than just what was needed for the game,” creative director Christian Hagerdorn tells me during a recent preview event. “One of our biggest focuses was to be absolutely transparent with the players. Not just on where we were standing, but where we were going. We've been collecting the feedback as we were developing”.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "A series of senior job listings have revealed some details about The Molasses Flood’s upcoming Witcher game, codenamed Project Sirius. The studio behind Flame In The Flood were acquired by CD Projekt Red back in 2021, and CDPR first mentioned Sirius in an investor call last October. The project was initially described as \"an innovative take on The Witcher universe telling an unforgettable story.” We now know that this “unforgettable story” could potentially be told inside of a multiplayer game, or at least a game with multiplayer and social elements.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The crossover pack’s announcement (via the Square Enix Extreme Edges Twitter account) did tease a few of the things we can expect to clean up, including the Seventh Heaven bar, and FF7’s first boss the Guard Scorpion.

Others, like Randy Smith, simply show up on their first day and find they’re exactly where they’re meant to be.\r\n\n\r\n“The approach that Looking Glass had to creating games was pretty unique,” he says now. “Even to this day, there are few studios who have that same ideology and mindfulness in how videogames are made.”\r\n\n\nThief: The Dark Project had a great director, in the form of Greg LoPiccolo, who later became a pioneer in the world of music games with Guitar Hero and Rock Band. And before him, Ken Levine had laid down the cobbles of Thief’s setting, defining its noir-ish tone before heading off to work on System Shock 2. Yet Looking Glass games weren’t driven by a singular 90s auteur. In fact, the very absence of ego in the studio’s culture meant its many “bright stars” were happy to adhere to a shared vision.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Still, some lingering performance woes on the Deck mean I’m probably going to continue Isaac Clarke’s first and worst job on desktop alone.\nTo be fair, the remake is playable on Valve’s handheld. It’s not outright broken, despite having been so on launch day, with problems ranging from drastic FPS dips to outright hard crashes. Following some impressively fast work from Valve themselves, focusing on hotfixes for SteamOS’ Proton compatibility software, Dead Space’s Deck performance has become more or less manageable.

          "description": "Above the Berlin Samurai Museum's gift shop and flanked by ornate helmets of fearsome warriors of a bygone era, I played a few hours of Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio's remake of historical Yakuza spin-off Like A Dragon: Ishin this week. The original was a Japanese-only release back in 2014 on the PlayStation 3, but what a fever dream it was to be dropped into Chapter 3 of the story and let loose on an Edo period Kyoto as none other than Ryoma Sakamoto (multiverse Kiryu). I almost cried, I raced chickens, I caught a big eel, and I've come away with a warm fuzzy feeling inside.\nFrom what I've played of the game's earliest portions, it's Yakuza through and through, to both its benefit and detriment. I don't expect it to convert those who dislike the series, but if you're a fan or a newcomer, it's looking like it'll both be a celebration of its cast, and a remake that feels like an old-school spin on the excellent Yakuza 0. In other words, the perfect introduction point to this mad, but beautiful action series. \nRead more",

Now, developers Behaviour Interactive have announced the FPS will see an open beta from February 6th to February 13th on Steam, ahead of its release in April. You’ll need to construct your own outpost to ward off other intrepid players who’re after your genes to splice, and set off on your own incursions to try the same yourself.\r\n\n \nRead more",

He’s also handy around a toolbox and is more than familiar with high-risk equipment like the Plasma Cutter. Oh, and he’s remarkably good at slicing and dicing necromorphs into juicy squelchy lumps. What a resume!\nBut did you know that our favourite space engineer also has lots of secret talents too? When Dead Space originally came out in the back end of 2008, his corporate overseers at EA sent Mr. Clarke to do all sorts of odd jobs before he popped off on the believeable, but bleak USG Ishimiura. Golf caddy, professional skateboarder, even a part-time dragon slayer. Heck, he's recently been back on the second gig train with his stint in Fortnite just earlier this week. The poor dude is in desperate need of a vacation. Until then, though, come and marvel at Isaac's many talents and see what a hard worker he is.\nRead more",

I sort of did what the Goonies do when they first find the map to One Eyed Willie's treasure, or what anyone in Pulp Fiction does when they open the briefcase: \"Wooooaaaah.\"\nConsider the progress of information. It's a sci-fi roguelike best played, I think, in 4-player online co-op. You play a sword-wielding combat mech. You also control a small frog standing on the mech. You drop onto proc-gen planets overrun by a kind of magical accelerated entropy, that turns everything black and pink and grey. By destroying totemic altars orbited by floating eyeball robots, you start to re-energise the planet, so areas have grass and butterflies. Eventually you will destroy enough totems to get to a planetary boss fight, which might be against, for example, a giant ghost samurai or a floating purple hand with an eyeball in it. It's mad, but I sure do wish more games were like this.\nRead more",

You wander around your home for the last time, choosing five objects which inspire deep memories that spur each of the five senses. You then place them into a cauldron one by one, your mother keeping a watchful eye. The ritual comes to an end and the result is a small glowing pendant that will protect you from the dangers of the outside world. “You must promise me never to take the pendant off,” your mother says. The Goodbye ritual is finished, and you leave, knowing you’ll never see your mother or your hometown ever again, all as the prophecy foretold.\nIt’s a fantastic - if sad - start to Season, and gets straight to the heart of the adventure ahead of you. This is a world where prayers, rituals, and prophecies hold great weight, and where you'll be exploring the fragility and fickleness of memory. Underpinning everything is a deeply profound sense of melancholy - and here I was expecting some relaxing two-wheeling through lovely-looking landscapes. Well, turns out Season is a lot more than a pretty travelogue.\nRead more",

          "description": "Spoilers inside!\nIf you've played through Bayonetta 3, odds are you noticed the soundtrack while blasting away demons and angels alike: and that includes the song \"We Are As One.\"\nPerformed by Rachael Hawnt (who also worked on the lyrics, with music by Hiroshi Yamaguchi), the video is a whopping seven minutes long: mixing in real-life footage of Hawnt and musicians performing the song, on top of cutscenes from Bayonetta 3. Note that the video (as Nintendo warns) does contain spoilers for the game. We won't mention them specifically here, but it does flash through scenes from mid-to-late game Bayonetta 3 story moments amid the footage of the performance. Folks who have finished the game already will likely get more out of it, especially given the emotional resonance of the song itself.\nThis is all great timing, as the powers that be are planning a full OST release for Bayonetta 3 this April, with a whopping 250 tracks across eight CDs. Here's the full breakdown of what the mega-release contains: \"It is the largest in the series, containing more than 250 tracks on 8 CDs. Liner notes are included, including explanations of all tracks and comments from the creators and directors. Beautifully packaged in a three-sided decorative box. Fully supervised by the game developer, Platinum Games.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7Orapv0MI\nThe post Nintendo just dropped a Bayonetta 3 music video appeared first on Destructoid.",

My memories of it are suitably hazy outside some key scenes, but I remember the visual appeal, its interesting setting, and the fact that its narrative came so damned close to being satisfying and just falls slightly short. The important thing is I wanted more, so I was excited when Eggnut announced their next game would continue the series.\nTails: The Backbone Preludes is exactly that: a set of four short stories that flesh out Backbone’s characters. While it gives more context to what goes on in the narrative of Backbone, what I feel is more important about it is it’s another excuse to descend into the discomforting, roiling pot of pitch-noir narrative that the series is going for.

It could perfectly pull off every other detail except the face! It was almost horrific when the Pokémon would turn around and have this blank face, but at least it was easy to tell that it was Ditto. In the games, this little quirk is not present. If you're searching for a Ditto in Pokémon GO, unfortunately, there's no way to distinguish one in disguise from just a normal Pokémon. So how in the world do you catch one?\nHonestly, you just have to get lucky! That's a sucky answer, I know. Unfortunately, you won't know if a Pokémon is a Ditto in disguise until you catch it. Only once it is safely captured in the PokéBall will a little question pop up. Then Ditto's true form will be revealed. Of all of the Pokémon to catch, that has to be the most exciting then!\nThese tricky little blobs are pretty rare, and their shiny counterparts are even rarer. Don't worry though, a shiny Ditto will not be disguised as a shiny Pokémon. You don't have to be afraid that when you finally catch a shiny you've been looking forward to it will turn out to be a blue blob of putty.\nNiantic, the team behind Pokémon GO, doe not release an official list of Pokémon each month that are likely to be the shape-shifter. The whole idea is to have the illusion that it could be any of them. However, some sites, such as IGN, have a running list of likely disguises each month based on anecdotal evidence. People catch Ditto and seem to find monthly patterns, which makes sense from a tech standpoint.\nYou can't really train Ditto, and it's useless in battles, so you might as well just enjoy the lottery. Maybe you'll get lucky, maybe you won't. If you want more concrete tips on catching Pokémon in the mobile game, we have guides on how to catch Leafeon and Glaceon as well as how to catch Kecleon.\nThe post How to catch Ditto in Pokémon GO appeared first on Destructoid.",

Kaizou Choujin Shubibinman Zero (hereby known as Shockman Zero) is an entry in the Shockman series of games. While the series is better known for its entries on the PC-Engine/Turbografx-16, it got its sole Super Famicom release in 1997 via the Satellaview. Over here in the west, we only received Kaizou Choujin Shubibinman 2 in 1992 as Shockman, though it later saw re-release on Nintendo’s Virtual Console service on Wii and Wii U.\nThe Satellaview was an early digital download platform for the Super Famicom, which meant that after that service went offline, the title was no longer available. However, it got re-released in cartridge format via Columbus Circle in 2017. You can still find it available in some places if you’ve got a Super Famicom to stick it in.\n[caption id=\"attachment_360788\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Romhacking.net[/caption]\nShockman Zero is a delicious mix of Mega Man-style platformer and beat-’em-up. It’s as if the Blue Bomber defeated Fist Man and learned to throw hands. It has a distinct Japanese flavor that reminds me of Gunstar Heroes. It’s also a co-op, so you can smite baddies with a friend.\nThe translation comes courtesy of homebrewers Svambo and Anonymousse However, as this was a Japanese-only release previously, this might be the closest we ever get to an official translation.

One or two players will lead the Kazimono sisters deep into the dark dungeons of a demonic castle, determined to purge its evil from their village school. Younger sibling Maya will be looking to bring down a battalion of hellish opponents with her lethal *checks notes* origami skills, while her older sister Shinobu is, somewhat more traditionally, going with good old-fashioned lead — delivered accurately and with speed.\n\nInti Creates' stylish-looking title shifted onto my radar at the end of the era, thanks to its cool pixelated visuals, cheesecake anime style, and interesting mix of magic and bombastic action.

          "description": "Full Scarlet & Violet support is still on the way\nThe last time Pokemon Home got a major update was all the way back in October, but as of today, version 2.1.0 has hit mobile devices. This February 1, 2023 update addresses Pokemon Scarlet & Violet, but it doesn't quite add full Home support just yet.\nPrimarily, it looks at adding ranked battle info in the mix, as well as battle results from Sword & Shield (remember those?!). The catch is that you'll need to link your Home account to a Nintendo account with data from the newest generation: otherwise you won't be able to view said data. This is alongside of the typical \"other issues/various fixes\" vaguery in many AAA franchise patch notes.\nAs a reminder, full Scarlet & Violet access is still on track for \"spring 2023\" according to several listings on The Pokemon Company websites. It can't come soon enough! So far in terms of \"off book\" Pokemon releases we've gotten Charizard, Cinderace, and Greninja: as well as the full evolutionary lines for all three.\nPokemon Home version 2.1.0 full patch notes:\nAdded Ranked Battles information from Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet to the Battle Data feature.\nIf you've linked Pokémon HOME to a Nintendo Account with data from Pokémon Scarlet or Pokémon Violet, you'll now be able to view results from your Ranked Battles in Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet.\nYou can view your battle results from Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield by choosing View Past Battle Records.\nOther issues have also been addressed in order to ensure a user-friendly experience.\nThe post Pokémon Home was just updated to support Scarlet & Violet ranked data appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "You got Wang\nDevolver Digital has announced that the latest entry in the Shadow Warrior series is getting a glow-up in the form of a definitive edition on February 16. Bringing forth some performance upgrades and new features, Shadow Warrior 3: Definitive Edition could be seen as the next-gen version. Existing owners of Shadow Warrior 3 will be getting a free upgrade to the new version.\nOriginally released in 2022, Shadow Warrior 3 took series protagonist Lo Wang back to his single-player roots after the more four-player co-op-focused Shadow Warrior 2. While it’s a more linear take than Flying Wild Hog’s previous games in the revival series, it introduced more movement options with dashing and wall-running.\n[embed]https://youtu.be/GL0mpzLbu1Y[/embed]\nThe headlining features are a survival mode, hardcore difficulty, and new game plus. Survival mode unlocks after you’ve beaten the main storyline and offers up some weapon skins if you can, uh… survive. Hardcore difficulty is, as the name suggests, a more challenging way to play through the game. Meanwhile, New Game Plus is a little less clear, with Devolver Digital saying that it allows you to “Enjoy additional challenges, rewards, and skins to give Lo-Wang that much-needed confidence boost.” They haven’t really said if you get to keep your upgrades for the second playthrough.\nAlong with these additions is hero mode, which introduces a life system to the gameplay. There is also a chapter selection, allowing you to replay your favorite slices of the game.\nIn terms of stepping up to the current generation of consoles, on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, there will be a performance mode for 60fps gameplay, or you can trade that for 4K visuals and 30fps.\nShadow Warrior 3 is currently available for PC, Xbox One, and PS4. The Shadow Warrior 3: Definitive Edition upgrade will add native PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions to the mix on February 16, 2023.\nThe post Shadow Warrior 3: Definitive Edition coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Oh yeaaah, dig it!\nThe release of WWE 2K23 is fast approaching its March 17, 2023 date with retail, and to get you in the suplexing mood, 2K Sports has released a trailer showing off its WarGames mode. This mode features two rings, side-by-side within a steel cage, and has two teams facing off with each other with three or four members a piece. The members of each team are let into the cage in an alternating fashion, and the winning team is decided by pinfall or submission once everyone is inside.\nWarGames started off with Jim Crockett Promotions, which would become WCW. It would continue appearing throughout WCW’s run, which ended in 2001 when WWE (WWF at the time) bought them out. WarGames was then brought back in 2017 with the NXT brand, albeit with some minor changes.\n[embed]https://youtu.be/P529mRa_cog[/embed]\nWith the inclusion of two rings, this is actually a pretty big addition to the series. I expect to see many limitations in terms of what venue and mode it can be played in, but it could be a fun way to mix up multi-player. I just don’t want to see what the load times look like when you have two teams full of custom wrestlers.\nMore importantly, though, the trailer shows that “Macho Man” Randy Savage is once again on the roster this year for WWE 2K23. He looks about the same as he did in WWE 2K22, but my enthusiasm for the release would be significantly diminished if he wasn’t in it.\nWWE 2K23 will be available for PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam on March 17, 2023. It will arrive in Standard, Deluxe, and Icon Edition flavors.\nThe post New WWE 2K23 trailer shows off WarGames mode, confirms Macho Man appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "EA and FIFA set to part ways\nElectronic Arts announced its financial earnings for its third quarter of the fiscal year, revealing that the latest, and last, entry in its long-running FIFA franchise, FIFA 23, is on track to be the best-selling release in the franchise's entire history.\nSpeaking in a conference call, transcribed by VGC, EA CEO Andrew Wilson noted that North American sales of the football sim are up a huge 50% on last year's release, and as such the title is \"pacing to be the biggest title in franchise history\". As we previously reported, Electronic Arts FIFA 23 had an incredible launch week, racking up an incredible 10.3 million players within one week of its September 30, 2022 launch date.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tIW1X2dv0c&vl=en&ab_channel=EASPORTSFIFA\nIn a strange irony, what could prove to be the most successful Electronic Arts FIFA title of all time will also be the last collaboration between the game publisher and international football's statutory body. As of next year, Electronic Arts will launch its new brand, EA Sports FC, while the Federation Internationale de Football Association itself is hoping to find success with its own football simulation series.\nDespite the insistence by FIFA president Gianni Infantino that the new, official FIFA game will be \"the only authentic, real game\", and \"best one available for gamers and football fans\", I think we know where the development talent and marketing savvy really lie. And, given the skyrocketing success of FIFA 23, The FIFA federation may soon regret pricing itself out of one of — if not the — most consistently performing franchise in the entire history of video games.\nFIFA 23 is available now on  PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.\nEA says FIFA 23 is on track to be the biggest title in franchise history [VGC]\nThe post Electronic Arts’ FIFA 23 set to become franchise’s best-selling entry appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It'll be tough to match the excellence of Tomb Raider GO\nYesterday, we told you about the upcoming Street Fighter game that's launching on mobile. Today, it's Tomb Raider's turn. Lara Croft is set to return to iOS and Android devices this month with Tomb Raider Reloaded. Featuring the voice talents of Keeley Hawes and a look that harkens back to the golden era of this franchise, Reloaded sees gaming's most famous treasure hunter pillaging more ancient ruins in search of stuff to keep at her mansion. This time around, the locations she'll explore–which include famous locations like St. Francis' Folly and the Lost Valley–are procedurally generated. That's right, this game is a roguelike, and as you can see from the Tomb Raider Reloaded trailer below, it doesn't look too bad.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU9LTV1qvY0\nAfter having Lara Croft go through more \"realistic\" adventures, it's nice to see her back doing what she does best: fighting dinosaurs. Developed by Emerald City Games in collaboration with Crystal Dynamics – Eidos, Tomb Raider Reloaded will feature all the acrobatics Lara Croft is known for, as well as classic enemies, traps, and puzzles. Players will be able to upgrade Lara with new equipment and XP, and like every other free-to-play game on mobile, the developers hope to keep you booting the game up daily with events and challenges. Cellist Tina Guo, who was a featured soloist on the Grammy-nominated Journey soundtrack, is spearheading orchestral recordings of classic Tomb Raider songs for the game.\nTomb Raider Reloaded will launch worldwide on February 14, 2023. You can download it for iOS or Android, and if you have a Netflix subscription, you can access the game without any of the ads and microtransactions found in the free-to-play version.\nThe post Lara Croft is taking another shot at mobile this month with Tomb Raider Reloaded appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Strut Your Stuff\nIf you have your eye on Street Fighter 6 newcomer Manon, then you aren't alone, as the dancer, model, and martial arts master has turned more than a few heads since she made her presence known as part of the upcoming scrapper's roster — Capcom released a new matchup of the French fighter in action, alongside the debut of her in-game theme.\nhttps://youtu.be/nkmtV54XsJo\nYou can check out the fight above, which sees Manon severely outweighed and outgunned by another SF6 newcomer, Marisa. Still, with a  mastery of poise and balance, as well as her innate acrobatic ability, Manon still manages to get more than her fair share of licks in — demonstrating her deceptive reach, a physics-defying arsenal of grabs and throws, and a frankly bizarre \"splits-slide\".\nManon is definitely shaping up to be one of SF6's most interesting newcomers, from both a design and gameplay perspective.\nManon - Walk With Grace\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k5XctUu0Dw&ab_channel=StreetFighter\nManon's theme, \"Walk With Grace\" is a smooth, modern effort, clearly composed to reflect not only the character's personality but also the many strings in her talented bow. The tune starts out with a melody as mysterious and as intriguing as the woman herself, before transitioning to a rhythmic \"stride\" — a beat that conjures up visions of confident models powerfully marching down a catwalk, or the red carpet. As a hybrid superstar, Manon has been afforded a tune that is a blend of her talents, synergizing together her celebrity status, her graceful motion, and her natural, somewhat aloof, sense of mystery.\nStreet Fighter 6 launches June 2 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox. Be sure to check out the themes for Ryu, Chun-Li, Luke, and Jamie, Juri and Kimberly, and Blanka and Dhalsim, in our previous articles.\nThe post Check out Street Fighter 6 star Manon in her latest matchup appeared first on Destructoid.",

Roughly 50 people were on the team working on this game and EA will reportedly attempt to find positions for these employees elsewhere within the company. If positions cannot be found, some might be laid off with severance packages, according to Bloomberg. \n\n\nThe publication says Mohammad Alavi (Titanfall 2, Apex Legends designer) was set to direct this now-canceled game, but he left the company in 2022. \nIt's likely this canceled single-player game set in the Apex Legends and Titanfall universe was the one hinted at back in July in job postings that referred to the game as an \"Apex Universe FPS Incubation Title.\"\nWord of this cancelation comes shortly after EA announced it was shutting down Apex Legends Mobile and Battlefield Mobile, and shuttering the latter's developer, Industrial Toys, as well. Plus, in the same financial results where EA revealed it was shutting these games down, the company revealed that Respawn's upcoming single-player Star Wars game, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, had been delayed to April. \n[Source: Bloomberg]\nDo you think we'll ever get Titanfall 3?

          "description": "Sony's latest financial results covering Quarter 3 of Fiscal Year 2022, which consists of the last three months of the year, reveal the PlayStation 5 had its best quarter on the market yet. \nThe company has surpassed 32 million PS5 units shipped, sitting roughly at 32.1 million, after shipping 7.1 million during the last three months of 2022. It's important to note this isn't a sell-through number so theoretically, there could be consoles sitting on shelves still. But a company ships more units when the demand is there, so it's likely that the majority of these shipped consoles were sold. \nPlayStation did just as well on the first-party software side of things, selling 20.8 million during Q3 of Fiscal Year 2022, which is almost more than double the 11.3 million sold during the same period in 2021. Of those 20.8 million, roughly 11 million were of God of War: Ragnarok, which was the console's big holiday release. \n\n\nIncluding both first and third-party software, 86.5 million units were sold for the PS5, which is less than Q3 of Fiscal Year 2021 (92.7 million) but still an impressive number nonetheless. Sixty-two percent of the software sold this past quarter was digital. \nPlayStation Plus subscribers reached 46.4 million in Q3, which is up from Q2's 45.4 million but down from Q1's 47.3 million. The peak in the PS5's lifetime happened in Q3 of Fiscal Year 2021 at 48 million subscribers.\nIn terms of monthly active PlayStation users, Q3 reached a new peak for the current generation of PlayStation, hitting 112 million. That's up 10 million from the quarter before it and roughly 1 million more than the same quarter in 2021. \nAll told, Q3 of Fiscal Year 2022 was the PS5's best quarter yet. \nDid you pick up a PS5 this holiday season?

Sony didn't provide a reason for why it's closing the collection, but it also clarifies that other PS Plus perks, such as the monthly games, will not be affected. Here’s the full message below:\nThe PlayStation Plus Collection launched alongside the PS5 as an added bonus to those owners. In a way, it served as a mini-version of Xbox's Game Pass, albeit only featuring last-gen titles. The collection has remained largely the same since 2020, with a couple of titles joining the roster and only Persona 5 being removed from the original line-up last year. The PS Plus Collection currently consists of the following titles: \nBatman: Arkham Knight\nBattlefield 1\nBloodborne\nCall of Duty: Black Ops III: Zombie Chronicles Edition\nCrash Bandicoot N.Sane Trilogy\nDays Gone\nDetroit: Become Human\nFallout 4\nFinal Fantasy XV: Royal Edition\nGod of War (2018)\nInfamous: Second Son\nThe Last Guardian\nThe Last of Us Remastered\nMonster Hunter: World\nMortal Kombat X\nRatchet & Clank (2016)\nResident Evil VII: Biohazard\nUncharted 4: A Thief's End\nUntil Dawn\nLast year, Sony added two premium PlayStation Plus Subscription tiers that give those members access to a much larger (and more regularly updated) library of games across multiple generations of PlayStation. Premium members can access most, though not all, of these titles now, so perhaps Sony wants to incentivize standard PS Plus subscribers to upgrade. Regardless, be sure to nab these games now if you haven't already before the May 9 deadline sneaks up on you.",

It is for this reason, after months of working with our development partner, that we have made the mutual decision to sunset our mobile game. Although disappointing, we are proud of the game we launched, are grateful for the support of the Apex Legends community, and are confident that this is the right decision for players.\" \nAll real-world money, in-app purchases have been disabled and the game has been removed from webstores.

For years, we dreamed about a lively city filled with people fighting to become a champion. We strived to create a vibrant place that celebrated the competitive spirit. Our goal was to bring joy back to online multiplayer gaming. The people who gave Rumbleverse a chance and took it on as a new hobby have validated every day that we put into bringing our ideas to life.”\nRumbleverse’s online servers shut down on February 28 at 10 a.m. CST. Players who spent any money on or within the game will receive refunds. That includes the Rumbleverse Battle Pass or Brawlla Bills on any platform. The current battle pass will also be given to all players free of charge with double XP gain. Certain emotes and accessories have been made free to acquire as well. Today, Iron Galaxy will close the in-game store and will release the final update. \nRumbleverse was first announced during the 2021 Game Awards and offered a unique spin to the battle royale with its emphasis on melee combat. After holding various beta tests throughout the first half of 2022, the game fully opened its doors in August to a generally warm reception from players and critics. You can watch us take it for a spin in this episode of New Gameplay Today Live. \nIn similar news, today Konami announced it's turning off the lights to its 2022 social deduction game, Crimesight.",

          "description": "Crimesight, a social deduction game released last year, got a surprising update on its steam page last night. Despite being out for less than ten months, Konami is ending support for it — and making the game unplayable.\n“Thank you for playing CRIMESIGHT,” the news post reads. “This service has continued to operate with the support of many users since its launch in April 2022, but due to various circumstances, we have decided to terminate the service on Monday, May 01, 2023 at 00:00 PDT.”\nSupport for an online game is bound to end at some point, but seeing the service cut off so quickly has many fans caught off guard. This is also the end of more than just the online modes. At the end of the post, Konami writes, “Also, the game itself won’t be able to play.” As a result, recent Steam reviews have a score of “Mostly Negative,” as players warn future buyers from purchasing a product that will soon be unplayable.\n【Important】 Service Termination Announcement\nhttps://t.co/v71WmsKCzE\nJanuary 30, 2023\nCrimesight is a multiplayer social deduction game set in a futuristic London. Moriarty's team seeks to commit a murder, and Sherlock's team tris to stop that from happening. While it was generally received positively by those that did play it, it didn't gain much traction. With only a handful of reviews on Metacritic and extremely low stats on SteamDB, a site that tracks concurrent player count, it's safe to say that one of Konami's \"various circumstances\" for canceling it is the size of its playerbase.\nIf you want to try it out, you've got until February to buy it, and until May before it stops working. If you want to try playing a different social deduction game, I've heard Among Us is good.\nDo you think Crimesight should stay on Steam? Let us know in the comments!",

However, Capcom and Crunchyroll Games are piling on with a new free-to-play mobile RPG called Street Fighter: Duel. If character collection games like Summoners War, Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, and Marvel Strike Force appeal to you, Street Fighter: Duel sounds like it shares many elements with those popular mobile titles.\nStreet Fighter: Duel includes more than 40 Street Fighter characters for players to recruit with the objective of building a team from across the franchise. Each team consists of three fighters who can be leveled up and customized with new skins. These fighters, who include characters like Ryu, Akuma, Chun-Li, Cammy, and more, all feature signature abilities and can pull off various combos through real-time 2D RPG combat or auto-battle mode. In addition to taking on Shadaloo, players can also look forward to head-to-head combat against other players.\n\n\n\"Street Fighter has been an iconic game for generations, and we know anime fans love to go on exciting adventures with beloved characters,\" Crunchyroll Games general manager and Crunchyroll senior vice president of emerging business Terry Li said in a press release. \"We're excited to collaborate with Capcom to bring Street Fighter: Duel and its incredible roster of iconic fighters to anime and gaming fans alike.\nPre-registration for both mobile platforms is available now through the official website. Those who pre-register will be gifted free in-game currency when the game arrives. Street Fighter: Duel is set to launch on iOS and Android in February.",

It came as a total surprise; Castlevania hasn’t had a new release in years, and most of Dead Cells’ other collaborations never amounted to much more than referential skins and a few weapons. To take such a big leap – and to do it with the series that inspired the game in the first place – is a huge step for the indie roguelike.\nWhile Dead Cells was developed by Motion twin, the Castlevania DLC is being developed by Evil Empire, an indie studio made of ex-Motion Twin employees that have handled most of the game’s post-launch content.

The game’s phenomenal blend of action and horror combined with its revolutionary over-the-shoulder gameplay cemented it as a bonafide classic, a magic Capcom hopes to recapture with a modernized remake. That reinvention graces Game Informer’s cover this month. \nWe visited Capcom’s headquarters in Osaka, Japan, to play Chapters One and Five of Resident Evil and speak to its principal designers, including directors Yasuhiro Ampo and Kazunori Kadoi, who previously led the Resident Evil 2 remake. You’ll read 12 pages sharing new details on the opening section, breakdowns of Ashley’s gameplay and other new tweaks, plus impressions of the church, cemetery, and house battle segments.\nIssue 353 is also our 2022 Game of the Year issue!

On top of that, we have a great feature detailing the localization process of MMORPGs and previews for anticipated titles such as Death Stranding 2, Armored Core VI, and Hades II. \nYou can also try to nab a Game Informer Gold version of the issue.

As previously promised, the wait is over because Marvel Snap’s new Battle Mode allows players to take on their buddies, and it goes live today.\nBattle Mode allows players to share battle codes with each other for private one-on-one bouts. This match-up consists of multiple back-to-back games with players using the same decks throughout. Players start with 10 health each and whoever wins a game deals 1 point of damage. However, this damage can be doubled by snapping. A player loses when their health hits zero, and there’s no round limit. Developer Second Dinner states that Battle Mode will receive updates expanding its features over the coming months. \nFor more on Marvel Snap, check out its spot on our Top 10 Games of 2022 to find out what makes it so special.

Made up of multiple netherworlds, the underworld residents followed the bushido code of honor until a tyrannical regime took over to promote a code of destruction. A pair of unlikely allies must team up to stop this threat: a lazy samurai named Futo and a hyperactive otaku girl named Pirilika. \n\n\nDisgaea 7 boasts over 40 character classes, including four new ones: Maiko, Bandit, Zombie Maiden, and Big Eye. It also retains the 3D sprites introduced in Disgaea 6. New mechanics include Jumbofication, which turns characters into super-sized versions of themselves to inflict massive attack damage. Item Reincarnation lets you transform equipment and items into new forms, such as turning a weapon into a healing item. Auto-battles have been improved with deeper character customization. Now, your forces can stand a better chance against other players' troops in the new online ranked battles. \nUnlike Disgaea 6, a Switch exclusive at launch, Disgaea 7: Vows of the Virtuless will be available on multiple platforms on day one.

The release year image features Monkey D. Luffy, played by Iñaki Godoy, raising his fist up in the air. You can see Netflix's One Piece logo in the image below as well: \nAdventure is on the horizon! One Piece sets sail in 2023 https://t.co/5YhPXFt8GS pic.twitter.com/GQH2MSAvCF\nJanuary 30, 2023\nAlongside the image above, Netflix has also released a new poster for the series, which features, from left to right, Taz Skylar's Sanji, Emily Rudd's Nami, Godoy's Luffy, Jacob Gibson's Usopp, and Mackenyu's Roronoa Zoro, standing on a beach in front of the crew's ship, the Going Merry. Check it out below: \nWhile these two images (and the casting) look great, we still haven't seen Netflix's One Piece show in motion so here's hoping we get a trailer sooner than later. One Piece begins sometime this year. \nWhile waiting for more, read Game Informer's review of One Piece Odyssey, the recently released One Piece JRPG. \nAre you excited for this show?

She was 45. \nWersching was diagnosed with cancer in the summer of 2020 and she died following a two-year battle against it yesterday, January 29. She is survived by her husband Stephen and her three children, Freddie, Ozzie, and Archie. A GoFundMe has been created to help raise money for Wersching's family. \nIn the video game industry, Wersching is perhaps best known for her role as Tess in Naughty Dog's 2013 hit, The Last of Us, but she was also known for her roles in 24 and Bosch, as reported by Variety. Many shared their love of Wersching yesterday following the news of her death, including The Last of Us co-creator and director Neil Druckmann. \nI miss my silly friend who helped bring Tess to life. Annie, you left us way too soon. You will forever be part of the TLoU & Naughty Dog family! 💔\nhttps://t.co/3QTnZtBY4B pic.twitter.com/baNHc1wdCT\nJanuary 29, 2023\nWersching was born in St. Louis, Missouri, and Variety reports that her first screen credit happened at 24 years old in a 2002 episode of Star Trek: Enterprise. From there, Wersching appeared in shows like Frasier, Supernatural, and Charmed, before she received recurring roles in General Hospital and 24. She played Tess in The Last of Us in 2013 and was hopefully able to watch Anna Torv's depiction of her character in HBO's The Last of Us over the past two few weeks. \n[Source: Variety]\nThe staff at Game Informer extends their condolences to Wersching's family.",

Movie, which hits theaters on April 7. In it, we see Donkey Kong begin to pummel Mario, which is a clip we've seen before, before Mario hits a yellow \"?\" block. This gives him the cat suit powerup and while it's useful in the game, that doesn't appear to be the case here as Rogen's Donkey Kong begins to make fun of the suit and Mario's reliance on it. \nCheck it out for yourself in The Super Mario Bros. Movie clip below: \n\n\nAs you can see, this is the most Donkey Kong dialogue we have heard in a teaser for The Super Mario Bros. Movie yet, and it reveals that Rogen's character is basically just him, complete with his signature laugh, too. This clip is yet another that looks great and we can't wait for this movie to hit theaters in a few months on April 7. \nFor more, check out this trailer from last year that showcases Anya Taylor-Joy's Princess Peach. \nWhat do you think of this new clip?

Today is that long-awaited day, as one of the most beloved and influential games from its era is available now on both platforms. While these versions are both largely faithful recreations of the seminal console FPS, key differences exist in ways that don't immediately surface one as the clearly superior version.

Season 1, so far, has been largely viewed as a success by critics and viewers alike. News of a second season isn't surprising because The Last of Us' premiere was the second largest debut for an HBO original series since 2010, and its second episode had the largest audience increase from a first episode to a second episode for an HBO Original drama series in the history of the network. \nCheck out the Season 2 announcement for HBO's The Last of Us below: \nThe journey continues. #TheLastOfUs will return for another season on @HBOMax. pic.twitter.com/FQNG6vhk1d\nJanuary 27, 2023\nAs for what to expect in Season 2, that remains unknown, but considering Season 1 is covering all of The Last of Us Part I, it's likely that the second season will cover at least part of The Last of Us Part II, if not all of it. A release date for Season 2 has not yet been revealed. \nEpisode 3 of HBO's The Last of Us airs this Sunday and is set to feature Bill, played by Nick Offerman. \nWhile waiting for this week's episode, read our interview with game co-creator Neil Druckmann and Joel actor Pedro Pascal about how The Last of Us was changed for TV, and then read about how there are no plans for The Last of Us show to go beyond the games. \nWhat do you think Season 2 of The Last of Us will cover?

In addition to detailing how players will liberate the town of Redfall from its vampiric captors, the team also shared a release date: May 2.\nThe bulk of the presentation showed off how players, either alone or working with up to three other friends, will cleanse Redfall of vampires neighborhood by neighborhood. In addition to gathering intel about the island and completing side quests, such as rescuing human hostages, you’ll capture safehouses. These become additional human HQs, and gaining more brings you closer to battling the area’s ruling vampire underboss. These elite enemies boast unique attacks and require your full might, along with your team’s efforts, to kill for good.\n\n\nWe also got a look at vampire nests. A giant heart fuels these otherworldly dens, and infiltrating one means cutting the heart from the body. Swarms of vampires will try to stop you, of course, but succeeding causes the collapse of a nest, meaning you’ll have to get out fast.

          "description": "Most new visitors don’t know about Mrs. Riddenbutter’s, but you should do yourself a favor and enjoy some of her hospitality and a tankard or two of her ale. Double-click on her door to open it, and step inside. Riddenbutter works the bar, and the smart traveler should speak with her. Drop an idea on her to get her chatting. Like most people, she likes to talk about this and that and the other thing, and she’ll also frequently respond with information that’s more local in nature.\nYes, the ScummVM team announces support for Halls of the Dead: Faery Tale Adventure II, a marvellous work by our GSoC’21 student Yuri Guimaraes aka a-yyg, who ported the original SAGA2 engine from 1997 by The Dreamers Guild.\nPlease assist us with testing this game. Take your old dusty CD and feed it to the ScummVM. As usual, you will need the latest daily build of ScummVM. If you encounter any bugs or problems during your gameplay, please file them on our issue tracker.\n>",
