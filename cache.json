Many licensed horror games are sadly relegated to genres that require a specific setup, such as asymmetrical multiplayer or short VR experiences, but The Thing — a third-person squad-based shooter — dared to go one step further, telling its own unique story that serves as a proper sequel to John Carpenter's 1982 movie masterpiece.\nIt's not a game that frequents mainstream remaster wishlists, but Nightdive Studios is nevertheless delivering what few of us realised we wanted with The Thing: Remastered. Announced during IGN Live and scheduled to land on the Switch later this year, Computer Artworks' original is getting the full revamp treatment, with updated visuals, improved lighting, numerous quality-of-life tweaks, and more.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

For one individual, however, carrying a replica Master Sword around in real life has led to a rather unfortunate jail sentence.\nAs covered by Eurogamer, a man named Anthony Bray from Nuneaton, England, was caught with a six-inch replica of the Master Sword while wandering about in public. According to Bray, it was intended to be used as a fidget toy, however, arresting officers stated that it \"was in fact a sharply pointed item which could be used as a weapon and might put others in fear of it being used against them\".\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

That much you could divine from its key art alone, with a girl on a raft sailing through crisp, blue waters towards sparkling white sands. It was only an hour or two into the game before we started to understand that Tchia is much, much more than that.

I have a lot of material, oodles of interviews with developers of all shapes and sizes - big shops like Remedy and CD Projekt, smaller studios like Ace Team and Awaceb, all holding forth on such topics as whether Elden Ring or Zelda did bandit camps better, and how you make a forest feel endless. There is so much you could talk about, so many trails heading off in all directions, but perhaps it's best to begin with the more personal and superficial question that inspired this investigation: how did the open world game get so boring? \r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "You may or may not have seen Black Myth: Wukong impressions floating around as of late. Some claim it's not a Soulslike, or is merely Soulslike-adjacent. Some say it's a \"boss rush\" with a world that lets it down. Having spent 90 minutes with it myself, I'd like to add my ferocious take to the pile: you play monke = is good. But no seriously, I think no matter if it's a bit Soulsy or not, my key takeaway is one of relief. There's a lot more substance to back up the style than I thought there would be, alongside it feeling a lot more compact than the behemoth I envisioned in my head. All good signs for the complete package, which strikes me as living up to the crushing pressure of its number one Steam Wishlist spot.\nRead more",

          "description": "Besides giving The First Descendant the ol’ benchy marks on desktop, I was curious to see how this gleaming looter shooter would run on the less flexing hardware of the Steam Deck. The answer: it didn’t, at first. Luckily, a semi-quick fix was enough to get me in, where I found a game that for all its ray tracing inclinations, is comfortable with life on the Deck. Reasonably. Most of the time.\nWith any luck, my issue could be purged completely by the time The First Descendant releases on July 2nd. Partly because I was using a technically non-final preview build, and partly because the problem itself was a silly one: launching was blocked by a case of missing Visual C++, something that the Steam Deck’s Proton compatibility witchcraft usually takes care of. Come on, Proton lad, you’re kinda dropping the ball here.\nIf this ever happens to you, in The First Descendant or any other game, I heartily recommend YouTuber JD Ros’ video tutorial on fixing it. The method boils down to installing the latest C++ versions via the Steam Deck’s Desktop Mode, then adding their executables to the game’s launch options. This worked a treat for me, and I didn’t suffer any further compatibility headaches from there on out.\n Read more",

The more than 100 games included at launch was far from stingy, with an extra dozen being added in a free update at the end of last year.

There's no ocean of online interactions, corroding the everyday from all directions, just 1-to-1s through boxy, retro-futurist screens that are so dingy and inadequate it feels like Ripley and Burke are peering at each other through a letterbox. Small wonder, given that Aliens was released in 1986, when what would become the internet was still mostly the province of universities and the military. \r\n \nRead more",

As Nic wrote earlier in the week, a portion of the negative feedback is aimed at the expansion's difficulty, which is certainly a Thing To Hear after years of being told by kindly gamers that I only hand out low review scores because I can't press the buttons in the right order.\nAs publishers Bandai Namco have sweetly observed, struggling players are perhaps forgetting that you can raise your overall power level by gathering Scadutree Fragments, a system of collectibles designed to ensure a tough challenge even for endgame players, while giving you the option of effectively rebalancing the expansion through exploration. The downside there, as a few people have pointed out, is that some players don't want to hunt for collectibles before they can topple the bosses.\n Read more",

The Elden Ring DLC is currently metacritic’s highest rated expansion of all time at 95, beating out the The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt’s Blood And Wine’s 92. However, roughly a third of the 41,000 user reviews on Steam are negative.\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Nintendo has added seven new games to their NES channel on their Nintendo Switch Online subscription. While some of these are expected first-party games, there are a few in the mix that are rather surprising.\n\n\nHere’s the full list:\n\n\n\nUrban Champion\n\n\nGolf\n\n\nDonkey Kong Jr. Math\n\n\nMach Rider\n\n\nThe Mystery of Atlantis\n\n\nSOLAR JETMAN\n\n\nCOBRA TRIANGLE\n\n\n\n\n\nThe one that stands out is Mystery of Atlantis, which was never released in North America. Mystery of Atlantis isn’t even the name on its birth certificate; it's Atlantis no Nazo (which really does translate to Mystery of Atlantis), a questionably challenging game from Sunsoft. It features 100 levels, but they’re not sequential. Figuring out how they connect, discovering bizarre secrets to find new exits, and eventually reaching the end is where most of the fun lies. And when I say bizarre secrets, there are instances where you have to jump into what is normally a bottomless pit and another where you have to blow yourself up in a specific spot. It’s not for everyone.\n\n\nOn top of that, we also have the also-questionable Urban Champion, an early fighting game. There’s Donkey Kong Jr. Math if you need to brush up on your arithmetic. Mach Rider and Golf round out the first-party offerings. Then there is also Solar Jetman and Cobra Triangle from Rare’s early days.\n\n\nIt's not exactly the most top-shelf selection of games from the console, but most of them are worth trying out. Maybe not Donkey Kong Jr. Math if you’re out of your grade school years.\n\nThe post Nintendo Switch Online gets seven new NES games including a previously Japan-only release appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, there's one feature that keeps cropping up in a less-than-favorable way. \n\n\nOf course, I'm talking about dye channels. The expansion brought two dye channels to the game, allowing players to create custom armors and set themselves apart from the crowd.

          "description": "Billy Kid is one of the starter characters in Zenless Zone Zero. A member of the Cunning Rabits, he takes jobs that send him into the Hollows to do all kinds of things, from saving people to bringing back lost items. He is also quickly becoming a fan favorite, but there is one question people seem to have about him, and that is whether he is even human.\n\n\nIs Billy Kid a robot in Zenless Zone Zero?\n\n\nBilly Kid is a cyborg, not a robot, and there is an important distinction. A robot is an artificial human being, usually housing some form of AI, and cannot be considered human in origin. A cyborg, on the other hand, is a human being that has undergone surgical procedures to have various parts of them replaced with artificial parts, as well as potentially undergoing other biochemical or electronic modifications. \n\n\nBased on his character design, it looks as though much of Billy's body has been replaced by metal parts. We can clearly see that both hands are mechanical, and his entire upper body appears to be as well. It's hard to know if his head has been replaced or if he is just wearing a mask, but we can tell that the excellent hair is certainly still real. \n\n\nWe know that Billy is a huge fan of a fictional show called the Starlight Knights, so it seems likely that his modifications were done to bring him closer to the level of his fictional heroes. Hopefully, as time goes on, we will learn more about Billy and what caused him to want to change his body, or forced him to.\n\nThe post Is Billy Kid a robot in Zenless Zone Zero? appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Before Zenless Zone Zero launched globally, you could pre-register for the game, participate in closed beta tests, and wait in anticipation of its arrival. By doing this, you contribute to the game's pre-registration milestones and, over time, help unlock various rewards. Following Zenless Zone Zero's release, you can claim these pre-registration rewards shortly after starting your playthrough.\n\n\nHow to obtain pre-registration rewards in Zenless Zone Zero\n\n\nClaiming pre-registration rewards in Zenless Zone Zero requires completing the game's first few tutorial areas and loading in as your starting playable character. After defeating the tutorial's boss and spawning in as your default character, open your game menu, select More at the bottom of the screen, and open your mail to view the global pre-registration milestone reward notification.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nFinishing the tutorial doesn't take long, as it mainly includes some cutscenes and battles. Depending on whether you skip the cutscenes and read the story's dialogue, you can expect to get through the tutorial in about 10-30 minutes.\n\n\nWithin the global pre-registration reward message, you'll find a message of gratitude from miHoYo alongside a list of items. Below is every reward you'll obtain:\n\n\n\nMaster Tape (20)\n\n\nBoopon (5)\n\n\nCorin (1)\n\n\nDenny (30,000)\n\n\n\nIn short, as a thank you for pre-registering for Zenless Zone Zero, you'll get various rewards, including Corin Wickes as a free playable agent and some money.

The hulking statue will be on display from 10AM - 10 PM local time from July 4 through July 7 for fans looking to visit.\n\n\nImage by WoW on Weibo\n\n\nIn Warcraft lore, Gorehowl is a legendary two-handed axe wielded by the orcish Hellscream family. In the games, Gorehowl was originally wielded by Grommash Hellscream before being passed on to his son, Garrosh, who wielded it through the Mists of Pandaria expansion before discarding it for an Old God replica of the weapon called Xal'atoh, Desecrated Image of Gorehowl. Players can acquire their own version of Gorehowl from the final boss of Karazhan, Prince Malchezaar, though canonically it's not actually the Gorehowl weapon.\n\n\nThe statue is celebrating the return of World of Warcraft to China which is scheduled co commence this summer. The popular MMORPG was taken offline in China last year after Blizzard and NetEase failed to reach a new agreement. NetEase had originally built a replica of the Gorehowl weapon back during the Warlords of Draenor expansion release in 2014, but dismantled it after the two failed to come to an agreement. The new \"Lightforged\" variant of Gorehowl that is now on display represents a resurrection of sorts, which is fitting for the new agreement.\n\n\nThe first 5,000 visitors to the site each day can complete a \"photo-taking quest\" to earn a commemorative inflatable Gorehowl to help them remember the event.\n\n\nThe next World of Warcraft expansion, The War Within, is set to release next month on August 26. The MMORPG will become available again in China on August 1, just in time for players to reacquaint themselves ahead of the expansion launch.\n\nThe post Blizzard China reveals massive Lightforged Gorehowl statue celebrating return of World of Warcraft appeared first on Destructoid.",

You get a mount simply for finishing the MSQ, and there’s also a miniature minion version up for grabs if you know where to look. \n\n\nHowever, in order to get the Alpaca Cria minion, you’re going to have to put in the effort when it comes to Shared FATEs. In this case, you’ll need to complete a set number of FATEs within Urqopacha before you can unlock the Alpaca Cria minion. \n\n\nHow to get the Alpaca Cria minion in Final Fantasy XIV\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nIn order to get this little bundle of fluffy joy, you’ll need to complete at least 66 FATEs in Urqopacha. While this may seem like a lot of FATEs, the number needed to complete Rank 3 of Shared FATEs has been reduced compared to both Shadowbringers and Endwalker, so the grind isn’t as bad as it used to be. \n\n\nOnce you’ve done this, you should have stocked up a fair amount of Bi-color Gemstones, considering you earn a minimum of 16 per FATE completed with a Silver or higher rating. With these in your back pocket, head straight to Wachunpelo. \n\n\nYou’ll find the local Gemstone Trader at (X:27.5, Y:11.7), directly next to the main entrance to the settlement. \n\n\nAs long as you’ve reached Rank 3 in the area, you’ll be able to purchase the Alpaca Cria minion for 700 Bi-color Gemstones. Achieving Rank 3 also unlocks the Windswept Echoes Orchestrion Roll for 450 Bi-color Gemstones.\n\nThe post How to get Alpaca Cria minion in FFXIV Dawntrail appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "So you’ve hit level 100 in Final Fantasy XIV, completed the Dawntrail MSQ quests, and now you’re feeling a little lost. It can seem a little daunting, at first, to have a whole new world to explore, but worry not. \n\n\nFirst of all - take a break. It’s been an emotional journey filled with ups and downs, laughter and tears. Switch the game off, go outside, and soak in the real-life sunshine for a moment. Take a nap and eat some proper food - you’ve just saved Tural, so it’s not as if it’s going anywhere. \n\n\nAfter that, there’s actually a lot you can do. There’s no end of side content out there, especially if you know where to look. But, with that said, here’s the 10 things I start to focus on once the MSQ is behind me, in no particular order. \n\n\n1. Unlock the Dawn Hunt\n\n\nScreenshot by Destru…",

          "description": "EA has announced that it will delist three Battlefield titles from the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 digital storefronts at the end of the month. \nOn July 31, the PS3/Xbox 360 versions of Battlefield 3, Battlefield 4, and Battlefield: Hardline, along with their associated DLCs, will be removed from sale. Owners of these games will still be able to play their single-player content, but online support for these titles will end on November 7. The embedded announcement post on X also includes a link to an FAQ to answer additional questions about the sunsetting process. \nhttps://t.co/2W8dLlGjBM\nJune 28, 2024\nWhile the digital PS3/Xbox 360 versions of these games are going away, Battlefield 3 will still be available to purchase on PC. The same is true for Battlefield 4 and Hardline, and these two titles will also remain on sale for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The PC/PS4/Xbox One versions will remain unaffected by today’s updates.\nIt never feels good to see games get removed from sale like this. The reason likely has to do with EA sunsetting online support; it wouldn't be right to continue selling games with popular online modes if that component doesn't work anymore. For those still logging into Battlefield matches on PS3 and 360, you've got a few more months to enjoy the ride.\nFor more on Battlefield, you can learn about how the next entry is shaping up (which is being made with help by Dead Space remake developer Motive Studios) here.",

And it continues to look like a scary new addition to the A Quiet Place movie universe. \nThough there's still no release date – it's launching sometime this year on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC – this story trailer reveals more about the state of the world in The Road Ahead. It seemingly begins on Day One, when the aliens, which possess incredible hearing that requires people to remain silent to survive, attack Earth. It then jumps ahead to Day 105, with Alex, an asthmatic college student trying to survive the end of the world with her boyfriend Martin, on the hunt for supplies and more. \nCheck it out for yourself in the story trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead below: \n\n\nAs you can see, it seems Alex might be pregnant, which, if you've seen the first A Quiet Place movie, can make trying to remain silent in this world quite difficult. We'll have to wait a little longer to find out how the story of A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead plays out because it launches later this year on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. \nFor more about the game, watch the reveal trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead. \nAre you excited for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead?

It's easily the best character creator in series history and possibly the most robust I've ever seen in a video game.

Robust enough, even, that BioWare used it to create most of the NPCs in the game, save for mainline characters like companions.

And last week, we traveled to California to go hands-on with the game. You can read Game Informer's full Concord preview thoughts here, but in short: it feels great and we're excited to play more. \nWe have a lot of questions remaining about the game's progression, seasonal content, narrative emphasis, and more, but if the handful of hours we've played of Concord are any indication, developer Firewalk Studios has, at the very least, created a fun and great-feeling shooter.

Originally slated to launch next month on July 25, the upcoming narrative-driven city-builder is now arriving on September 20.\nDeveloper 11 Bit Studios sates that following a recent beta, the team wants to take extra time addressing feedback to ensure the best possible experience. In a press release, design director Jakub Stokalski and art director Lukasz Juszczyk issued the following statement:\n“Based on the surveys we received after playing Beta, the average rating you gave us was 8 out of 10. We’re super grateful for that! At the same time, it was only a small slice of a work-in-progress, still-growing game. While our backlog is plentiful, it was an opportunity for us to listen to what you enjoyed, and what didn’t quite land yet”. \n“This allowed us to prioritise things better, and bring upfront the features and modifications we were already working on. But we also realised that to guarantee the best possible experience on launch, we need more time to finish the development of Frostpunk 2. That’s why we made the difficult decision to postpone its release to September 20th, 2024”.\n11 Bit States that it plans to work on new additions to existing game mechanics and improve the UI and UX, among other things. \nFrostpunk 2 will launch first for PC on September 20. PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions are planned to arrive later. We recently played the game, and you can read our extensive preview here.",

More specifically, it hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via Steam) on August 1, and it brings with it updated visuals and controls and a new skin that harkens back to the original game's most infamous easter egg. \nIn the reveal trailer, we get a look at the graphical improvements Aspyr has implemented in Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, but the game still retains that 2002 PlayStation 2 and GameCube charm. This re-release follows a limited PlayStation 4 physical run that launched back in 2019. \nCheck out the Star Wars: Bounty Hunter announcement trailer below: \n\n\nIf you're unfamiliar with Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, you play as Jango Fett throughout the story, which itself is a prequel to Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones. \nIn the original game, there was an easter egg message that said, \"Cash in all bounties to play as Boba.\" However, cashing in all bounties did not let you play as Boba. To make good on that original promise from 2002, Aspyr media has included a Boba Fett skin in Star Wars: Bounty Hunters you can use after completing the game's campaign. \nStar Wars: Bounty Hunter hits PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on August 1. \nWhile waiting for its launch, check out this lengthy gameplay demo of Star Wars Outlaws, another mercenary-centric Star Wars game launching this year.

Though the once previously Xbox-exclusive game has since made its way to PlayStation and PC platforms, it remains unclear which platforms this remaster is coming to. And there's no word on when to expect the remaster either. \nRevealed with a short 47-second teaser trailer, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster looks great, almost more like a remake than a remaster. It's unclear if this is a remaster of the original 2006 game or the HD version of Dead Rising that launched on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC back in 2017. Regardless, we're stoked to head back into a zombie-infested mall with journalist Frank West whenever this remaster launches. \nCheck out the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster teaser trailer for yourself below: \n\n\n\nAre you excited for Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster?

Now, just a few days later, developer From Software has released a new patch for the game that should make Shadow of the Erdtree a bit easier. \nNow live, Calibration Update 1.12.2 targets the scaling of the attack and damage negation given to players with each Shadow Realm Blessing upgrade. Here's what's changed: \nThe attack and damage negation has been increased for the first half of the maximum amount of Blessing enhancements, and the second half will now be more gradual. \nThe attack and damage negation granted by the final level of Blessing enhancements has been slightly increased. \n\n\nThis patch should apply automatically like any other Elden Ring update but if it doesn't – the Calibration Version listed at the bottom right reads \"1.12.2\" if it has – select \"LOGIN\" and that will apply the latest version of the game. \nThe only other thing this update contains is word from From Software on a confirmed bug where the raytracing settings of Shadow of the Erdtree are automatically enabled (if you've previously loaded save data from previous game versions), which is causing framerate issues for some players. If you're encountering said issues, check to see if you have raytracing on or off in the game's system graphical settings. \nThis patch arrives after one that hit the game last week, which added new hairtsyles, inventory features, balance adjustments, and more to Elden Ring ahead of Shadow of the Erdtree's launch. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree review, and then check out this interview where From Software's Hidetaka Miyazaki discusses his approach to difficulty in games. \nWhat do you think of this update?

To access it, go to \"Settings\" on your PS4 version of Minecraft while playing on a PS5 and select \"Preview.\" This preview includes the new Tricky Trials update, so you can venture into the trial chambers, meet a breeze, craft a mace, and more. \nMojang asks that players who encounter bugs during this preview report it to the developer, and more generally, provide any feedback they might have. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Minecraft review, and then check out this story about how actor Jack Black has all but confirmed he's playing Steve in the upcoming live-action Minecraft movie.

Though other characters appeared in Sonic Generations, Sonic – in both his Classic and Modern forms – was the sole playable character. Now, 13 years later, the well-liked celebratory release returns as the latest Sonic remaster, but it's not simply the same package with performance enhancements. Sure, those are there, but perhaps the biggest selling point is the inclusion of Shadow the Hedgehog as a playable character. \nBut Shadow is much more than a reskin of Sonic.

From Dragon Age: Origins' real-time strategy RPG approach to Dragon Age II's mostly-set-within-one-city action experience to Dragon Age: Inquisition's strategy-action mix, BioWare hasn't quite defined the franchise's combat. However, a through-line is apparent from Origins to Inquisition: BioWare seemingly wants this franchise to be action but has attempted to shift to that without abandoning its longtime fans. \nWith Dragon Age: The Veilguard, BioWare has completed its transition from strategy to real-time action, but thanks to an optional tactical pause-and-play combat wheel that harkens back to the series' origins, I feel it's found a great (battle)ground …",

But something about that game has stuck with players. In addition to resonating with a wider audience than many of From Software's most iconic titles to that point, Bloodborne delivered an engrossing world full of mystery and challenge, causing it to remain top-of-mind for many Soulslike fans even today.

No, it’s not the key on your keyboard. Rather, it’s a detective story set on a distant planet. Important data has been stolen, and the perpetrator is a shape-shifter laying low in a spaceport dive bar until he can flee off-planet. You play a hard-boiled detective who has the skill to psychically visit bar patrons’ memories to gather clues and narrow down suspects.\nThis is thanks to the kind people at ZOOM Platform, who provided us with the original game sources to work with. Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game features a lot of options to chat around with bar patrons’ and do various actions in the different flashbacks. So we really need people to spend time experimenting and make sure everything works correctly. And please take some screenshots along the way.\nIf you don’t own The Space Bar, you can try one of the free demos or purchase it digitally from the ZOOM Platform. Testing is also available on Steam via a beta branch, check the Steam announcement for more details.\nNow, good luck, and fingers crossed you can find the perp. Otherwise, your bureau chief will have you getting up close and personal with toilet duties for the rest of your career. Oh, and PS: The viewpoints of different aliens differ. For the Bartender, who has segmented eyes, even the original developers felt it was difficult and left in a cheat key of ScrollLock to switch back to a single viewpoint. Feel free to use it if, at any point, the flashback becomes too much for you :)\n>",
