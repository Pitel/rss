It will stand as the first major video game project for Wētā Workshop, a company that most famously worked extensively on Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy, creating everything from sets to armour and weapons. It created a games development division back in 2014.\nDespite Wētā's familiarity with the movie adaptation of Lord of the Rings, Private Division's announcement states that \"Middle-earth Enterprises have licensed the literary works of the series, providing Wētā Workshop with the broadest creative license to interpret the underlying lore of the books\".\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

A narrative RPG with card-based battles, it sees you growing up in an off-world colony, with all the hardship that brings in addition to the more familiar and typical difficulties associated with navigating your teenage years into adulthood.\nIt's a coming-of-age \"sci-fi life sim\" with card-based bits, then, but one which doesn't shy away from mature themes and seems to gently reflect some of the existential crises we're increasingly facing in the real world, albeit in a cosier, less unremittingly bleak manner than the many and various survival game press releases that drop into our inbox on a weekly basis.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

As part of its recent Direct Presentation, it was revealed that a new trio called 'Deep Cut' would be handling the in-game news items, replacing the 'Squid Sisters' from Splatoon 1 and Pearl and Marina from the last game. The group consists of Shiver, Frye, and Big Man, with the former proving to be a popular talking point amongst fans, many of whom believe that Shiver may be Nintendo's first major non-binary character.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Spilling colour, nostalgia, and a little bit of childlike glee onto the pages of a notebook, this is a heartwarming tale of two friends at the end of a school day and a humorous take on a heroic adventure.\nThe story is set out by Kenta, a ten-year-old aspiring game developer with unmatched ingenuity. The construction of Cardboardia, alongside a cast of unforgettable characters, resides on the desk in a classroom, and each element of the game adopts a lovingly handmade appearance. Comprised of puppets, cardboard cutouts, and some pretty incredible origami, Kenta is keen to share the tale of Wright with the player from the moment you boot up the game.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

For those not residing in that modest nub of the Venn diagram, let’s see if you’ve moved there by the end of the page.\nSo let’s start with the “making sense” bit. “Kureshin” is the Japanese shortened name for Crayon Shin-chan, a manga series and anime sitcom about a two-kids-and-a-dog Japanese family, focused on Shinnossuke (Shin-chan), their impish five-year-old. It’s been running since 1990 and uses a distinctively wonky art style, a long way from the wet-eyed haircuts grimacing against strobing parallax some exported anime brings to mind. Shin-chan spends his time infuriating his parents, causing arguments, leaping into wild make-believe, repenting and making up, in a neat loop of boisterous hyperactivity and happy sentimentality.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Your reputation precedes you: before the accused can even sit down, they call out your unusual ability to hack into the minds of people to ‘patch’ their flaws, turning their nefarious intentions into fields of flowers. But it’s ok, isn’t it? After all, the person in front of you has committed a crime and must be rehabilitated; reckless driving, hit and run, and arson.\r\n\n\r\nSo, you get to work. Talking to Unid allows you to build a rapport and understand their motivations. You learn about their past. They talk of their difficult childhood, pets, a lack of support - broken systems that left them behind and put them on their current path. It doesn’t matter. You have a job to do. And now, with that bit of knowledge, you’ve found the 'bug' in their programming. After initiating a hack on their brain, you eradicate this flaw, forcefully transforming their mind into a paradise of purity. Unid will never commit another crime again. Have you done the right thing?\r\n\n \nRead more",

But after playing a preview of the game’s first mission, there's more than meets the eye in this part steampunk RPG, part circus tycoon management sim.\nYou play as Amelia, a young, bold journalist returning to London to cover the grand re-opening of the Circus Electrique. A metaphorical spanner gets lobbed into the works, however, as the ceremony is interrupted with news that London’s citizens have started attacking each other (more than your average fisticuffs to get on the tube). Oddly, this doesn’t seem to have affected Amelia and your motley circus troupe, who venture out into London’s dangerous streets to find answers.\nRead more",

          "description": "As many of you well know, I rather enjoyed cat adventure Stray recently. As an owner of two tortoiseshells myself, it was right up my alley. I do, however, have a confession to make. When I started seeing other real life cats enjoying the game alongside their respective humans, I began to feel sad and a bit left out. You see, my cats Maple and Midna (still!) haven't shown any interest in Stray whatsoever, not even flicking up their ears in response to the cat's in-game meow. I'm not gonna lie, it kinda broke my heart a little bit.\nHowever, I'm beginning to think their (clear and apparent) hatred of video games goes further than simple disinterest. I was playing A Plague Tale for the first time last week, a game famous for its swarms of screeching rats, and STILL nothing. They love hunting rats and bringing them home to leave as little presents for us on our back door step. Heck, they'll even wig out and go into prowl mode when they hear them scrabbling away underneath our floorboards (yes, we do have a rat problem in our house). But clearly, their ice cold little murder hearts are unmoved by their video game equivalents. Is this what it's like when your children reject your hobbies and go and sulk in their rooms for the rest of the day? Because it sure does feel like it.\nRead more",

You move by skittering about on wobbly green tentacles, leaping and climbing and clinging and lashing out at living things with them, then absorbing the green muck that bursts out, and periodically consuming a creature powerful enough to be worth assimilating. And wearing its skull in the centre of your tentacle mass, because why not.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I even played Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions, which had four different web-dudes and later inspired the Spider-Verse storyline in the comics. Point is, I'm standing on pretty solid ground to judge Spider-Man games. Marvel's Spider-Man, originally released onto Sonyboxes in 2018, is finally coming to PC in a Remastered form, and let me tell you: it is a great Spidey game.\r\n\nYou know Spider-Man. He's a dude named Peter Parker who was bitten by a radioactive spider and can now climb up walls and punch criminals really well. Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered lets you roleplay being Spidey against the backdrop of a big, living New York city. It is, if you'll excuse the pun, amazing. Now, is it the best Spidey game? Nah. I reckon that's its spin-off/sequel Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, but that's not on PC yet. This means Marvel's Spider-Man gets to be the best wall-crawler game on PC for another few months, which isn't a bad consolation prize. \nRead more",

A cluster of other followers are busy dancing around a shrine in the centre of the village, but they all stop to witness a fight between the two oldest members of the cult - Alice0 and Liam. Ritual combat of the elderly is a staple of CultPaperShotgun, and as Alice0 delivers the final blow to an ailing Liam, cries of euphoria reverberate about the camp as his spirit (and chunks of flesh) are donated to the cause.\nWhere am I in all this, you ask? I, the Lamb, the glorious leader of our cult, the holy vessel of Death itself, and the sworn enemy of the Bishops of the Old Faith that are destined soon to die by my blade?

Its vibrant cartoon visuals immediately caught my attention when I first sampled its Steam Next Fest demo earlier in the year, and I'm happy to report that the full game, out today, is just as captivating as it was back then. \nIt tells the tale of Toto and Gal, a pair of rambunctious siblings who end up far from home after getting lost inside a fantasy world of their own imagining. If they don't find a way back before nightfall, though, they'll be stuck there forever. A classic kids adventure story, in other words, but one that really relishes in its own sense of playfulness. Over the course of their four-odd hour adventure, they'll meet monster fighting frogs in a dark forest, board game-playing seagulls on the high seas, orc mechanics in a vast desert and even a heavy-metal loving sheep on a floating island in the sky as they make their way home  to their messy childhood bedroom. It all makes for some memorable puzzling backdrops, but be warned: if you're planning to play this with little ones, then you'll definitely need a puzzle savvy adult in the mix, as some of its brainteasers aren't quite as child-friendly as you might expect.\nRead more",

All he wants to do is study clouds: their different formations, their flight paths, their properties, everything.  He can’t get enough of them, and finds them fascinating enough to be the subject of his 100-page PhD thesis. It’s a poetic subject and one that matches his temperament as a boyish and awkward researcher and 'path of least resistance' kinda guy. But around him the world is spiralling from the political tensions of the Cold War, and as much as Peter wishes to escape to in the clouds, current events are keeping him firmly tethered to the realities of an impending war. \nIt’s this tension that makes South Of The Circle such an engrossing story. With player choices that subtly tug the game’s narrative needle in ways you might not expect, it's clear skies and fair winds for the game’s three-hour journey. But with an abrupt ending after a calculated slow-burn drama, it's a rough landing.\nRead more",

          "description": "Is it lazy to describe Turbo Golf Racing as ‘Rocket League if the cars were playing golf instead of football?' A bit, yes. But it’s also largely accurate. Up to eight players race across a track, ramming their boost-enabled car into their huge futuristic golf ball to send it flying forwards until (depending on your skill or luck) it flies/rolls/plops anticlimactically into the big hole at the end. It’s golf, sort of, but fast, demanding, and often unpredictable. You don’t even have to wear silly trousers while playing it, but that’s just my personal choice.\nOf course, it’s not quite so simple as hitting your ball forward and relying on the videogame gods to deem your ball worthy of reaching the goal before everybody else’s. There are 30 courses of varying length and complexity, and none of them are a simple drag race to the end. There are ramps, twists, turns, and plenty of obstacles. While the very shortest courses are pretty frictionless (I’ve won a few in under 20 seconds), the longest ones are practically begging you to make agonising mistakes.\nRead more",

In any case, the summer camps I've seen portrayed are usually unwholesome ones, because they're good horror fodder. Camp Canyonwood is a camp counsellor sim, out now in early access, where you (an bird) look after a flock of demanding smaller birds. It sounds like it would be twee, except the owner is cutting corners and you dream about a talking jackalope.

Or, at least, God of War Ragnarok. And since it's been a few years since 2018's God of War, a story recap might be of some use to folks as they gear up for the winter.\nPlayStation published a new video today, which recaps the story of Kratos and Atreus from the 2018 God of War. The storyteller walking us through it? None other than The Guild's own Felicia Day.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjucT-UZzgg\nThe rhyming tale takes a brief tour through the main story beats of God of War, pausing for a few jokes and asides from in-universe character Mimir. And while it doesn't cover every single beat, it does a pretty good job summing up Kratos and Atreus' journey, as well as some of the conflicts that arose and still persist headed into Ragnarok.\nWinter is coming\nIt's a good refresher to have too, as even though God of War was only a 2018 game, it does feel like eons ago to me at this point. Remembering the reason why Freya, for instance, has a bone to pick with Kratos seems like some important topical study material given some of the Ragnarok teases we've seen.\nGod of War Ragnarok is locked in for November 9, 2022. It's also one of the few games still in the holiday window, as more and more have been delayed out into the next year. Open-world wizarding RPG Hogwarts Legacy recently pushed back to February, and Marvel's Midnight Suns is on an undetermined delay as of this writing.\nRegardless, I'm really interested to see where the story goes from here, and how Sony Santa Monica Studios' interpretation of Norse mythology carries on. God of War Ragnarok arrives on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 on September 9, 2022.\nThe post Get caught up on God of War before Ragnarok with this story recap appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Squirrel with a Gun is nuts (in the best way)\nOne of the most fun things about following a bunch of game developers on Twitter is that you get to see the process of how some really cool indie games are made. That's exactly what happened to me with Dan DeEntremont's upcoming project Squirrel with a Gun — and yes, that's exactly what it sounds like.\nThe first I saw of this awesome game was a viral tweet from back in May of this year, where he showed off the first time he got fur on the squirrel. The whole thing looks insanely realistic, and obviously, the fact that the little fluffy rodent was holding and firing a gun caught everyone's attention. (I mean, who doesn't love a game with a fluffy, adorable protagonist.)\nhttps://twitter.com/QuiteDan/status/1525631771387338757\nOf course, the game has developed a whole lot more in the past few months, and it's pretty fun to scroll through DeEntremont's Twitter page and see all of the progress videos compiled in one spot.\nSquirrel with a Gun has rightfully gotten a lot of attention over the past few months, because I haven't seen a game capture the internet's sense of humor so accurately in a long time. Now the game has finally been listed on Steam, and while we may not have any kind of release window yet, it's cool to see a small developer making bits steps like that. I know I'm adding it to my wish list.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRz15LfZjBI\nSquirrel with a Gun is a testament to how social media has changed the landscape for indie developers in a big way. DeEntremont has been able to make this entire project by himself (at least to my knowledge) and garnered a huge following for it simply because he had a funny idea and the gumption to pull it off.\nHere's hoping that indie devs continued to be inspired by seeing others succeed like this, because the more goofy indie games there are in my life, the better.\nThe post Next up in hilariously adorable indie games: Squirrel with a Gun appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Put it back in the bargain bin\nI only knew two things before purchasing 2007’s Heavenly Guardian on PS2. First, it was going to be a game in the Pocky & Rocky series, only maybe not really. It looked to be aiming more at Kiki Kaikai, which the Pocky & Rocky games are the sequels to, but I’m not going to get into the finer details of why they’re almost two separate series. The quick version is this: Kiki Kaikai is Taito; Pocky & Rocky is Natsume. Yes, this means that Pocky & Rocky with Becky is more a part of the Kiki Kaikai series.\nAnyway, that’s boring. The second thing I knew about Heavenly Guardian going into it is that it’s considered to be kusoge.\n\nTotally different\nAccording to articles leading up to the release of Heavenly Guardian, the title was originally going to be Kiki Kaikai 2…",

          "description": "See what's new in the world of Disney and Marvel games\nThe D23 Expo is coming up, and with it a bunch of Disney and Marvel reveals. Alongside the movies and series, the games of Disney and Marvel are getting spotlighted in a showcase on September 9.\nThe Disney & Marvel Games Showcase will air on Sept. 9 at 1 p.m. PT / 4 p.m. ET. Hosted by Kinda Funny's Blessing Adeoye Jr., it will feature updates on several projects currently in the works.\nThose showing off new content include Disney & Pixar Games, Marvel Games, Lucasfilm Games, and 20th Century Games. New reveals from farming life-sim Disney Dreamlight Valley, tactical hero game Marvel's Midnight Suns, and Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga are all in store.\nWe'll also get a sneak peek at the upcoming Marvel game from Skydance New Media. That's the studio that Uncharted's Amy Hennig is leading up, which is working on both a Marvel and Star Wars project.\n\"The Marvel Universe epitomizes all the action, mystery and thrills of the pulp adventure genre that I adore and lends itself perfectly to an interactive experience,\" said Hennig when the Marvel project was announced last year. \"It’s an honor to be able to tell an original story with all the humanity, complexity, and humor that makes Marvel characters so enduring and to enable our players to embody these heroes that they love.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsgOSQbgO1Q\nGames showcases, assemble\nBoth Disney and Marvel have had a strong video game presence over the years. And now, it's joining in on the summer of gaming showcases.\nIt's not the only company with a showcase in September, either. Ubisoft is planning to host an Ubisoft Forward the day after this Disney and Marvel showcase, on September 10. An open-world Star Wars game is in development at Ubisoft, headed by Massive Entertainment. Whether we see that or not, it looks like there's a good chunk of gaming news happening in September.\nThe post Disney and Marvel Games Showcase set to air in September appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Some of the late-hits are toned down, though\nArcade1Up has another retro-revival arcade cabinet on the way, and this one's for the sports fans. The new NFL Blitz Legends cabinet combines three remasters of the popular over-the-top NFL Blitz series.\nThe three games in the cabinet are 1997's NFL Blitz, 1998's NFL Blitz '99, and NFL Blitz 2000: Gold Edition from 1999. All three are remastered in the cabinet, which will go for $599.\nThe cabinet features Arcade1Up's usual details, like full side art and a matching riser. Four spots are open for play too, so you can get the whole crew on the sticks for some Blitz. And while it's good for local co-op, the Blitz cab also supports online multiplayer via Wi-Fi, as well as leaderboards.\nFor the cabinet, Arcade1UP partnered with the National Football League and Football Greats Alliance to feature all of the football greats. This includes Dan Marino, Jerry Rice, Deion Sanders, Brett Favre, Jerome Bettis, Terrell Davis, and Cris Carter.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6TXv6b2GcE\nDiving into the endzone\nSome of the more rowdy violence has been a bit toned back, however. According to a press release, a specific set of tackles and after-the-whistle hits were removed or edited in the remastered versions of these three NFL Blitz games. These changes support the NFL's current Player Health and Safety Initiatives. So sorry, a little bit of the after-the-whistle shenanigans will be tuned down, as they've been in other releases.\nThis isn't the only big arcade cabinet announcement out of Arcade1Up in the last few weeks. The at-home cabinet designer also announced a Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 cabinet at Evo 2022, bringing the classic crossover and several other cross-franchise fighters together for a fighting game collection.\nPre-orders for the NFL Blitz cabinet are live here at the Arcade1Up site. Shipping is expected to start sometime in early October.\nThe post Arcade1Up announces an NFL Blitz Legends cabinet with three football classics appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Legion of Doom\nFans of veteran tactical combat series Jagged Alliance are already getting their gear together for the long-awaited sequel Jagged Alliance 3, which is currently in development at studio Haemimont Games. Publisher THQ Nordic released a new trailer for the RTS title during this weekend's Digital Showcase.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah9O1LQXIvE\nOnce again set against the backdrop of Grand Chien, Jagged Alliance 3 sees the fictional republic overthrown by a dangerous paramilitary force following the mysterious disappearance of its president. As \"The Legion\" embeds itself within each and every sector of the troubled nation, the family of its missing ruler reaches out to the clandestine Adonis corporation to send its best team of black ops mercenaries to locate the president, defeat The Legion, and restore Grand Chien to its former state of (relative) order.\nThe new sequel, which will arrive a full two decades on from 1999's Jagged Alliance 2, will feature the tactical engagement and strategic gameplay of its predecessor, powered by a brand new engine and modern-day mechanics. A huge cast of new and familiar mercenaries will be made available for the player's home-grown militia, given access to a huge arsenal of weaponry, equipment, and explosive, town-rattling gear. Battle The Legion's forces, train local insurgents, and retake the Grand Chien street-by-street in explosive campaign action alone or with co-op support.\nJagged Alliance 3 is currently in development for PC.

          "description": "Thanks, Nintendo\n\"Nintendo DLC\" is still a weird phrase to utter out loud. At one point in the gaming landscape I never really seriously thought it would be a widespread option, but it's rampant enough now to the point where it can be considered part of the company's identity.\nThey adopted the practice a little over a decade ago on the 3DS, where it sometimes was implemented in a janky fashion. From there they expanded to the Wii U. And even then I wasn't used to it! But once Nintendo started doing regularly scheduled DLC for nearly all of its games on Switch, it all fell into place. I've accepted it.\nWhich leads me to this: an official Nintendo DLC tutorial video. If you're confused on how to buy more stuff, they have you covered! The below video walks folks through the steps of redeeming the free DLC offers via their Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack benefits. It's as simple as \"going into the Switch Online menu, then scrolling down, looking at the benefits on offer, and clicking on them until you can hit a download button.\"\nRight now that selection mostly involves Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and Splatoon 2 DLC. Of note, it does not involve Super Mario Bros. 35, which is still discontinued.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDw5YSIy4wg\nThe post Nintendo shows people how to download DLC in a new official video appeared first on Destructoid.",

For one thing, they're always super expensive, and I'm trying to ball on a budget over here. I've also heard mixed things from my friends — for the most part, they say they're not super comfortable, although my roommate loves that it's nice and firm and makes them sit up straighter.

          "description": "\"We're not considering that at this point\"\nNintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa has been relatively accessible since he took over, and this past week, he spoke to financial outlet Nikkei about the lack of a Nintendo Switch price hike for the foreseeable future. Well, that's the plan anyway.\nFurukawa noted that they are \"not considering\" a Nintendo Switch price hike \"at this point,\" with two factors in play. The chief concern is \"pricing people out,\" given that they're aiming to expand their market and play the long game (Nintendo has also comfortably been in a position of being the cheapest mainstream gaming hardware throughout its history).\nAnother potential way the blow has been softened is through software sales, given that Nintendo also produces games that they want to keep viable with a large install base. Nintendo says that they want to \"maintain the momentum\" of the Switch so far. The issue apparently isn't with the actual innards of the Switch, but rather that \"demand exceeds supply.\"\nSo how are they staying the course without a price hike? Furukawa concedes that the \"OLED model will continue to be less profitable than our other models,\" because \"costs have undoubtedly increased for shipping not only by air, but also by sea.\" But he also notes: \"The weak yen may be seen as a benefit for Nintendo, since such a large share of our sales comes from abroad, but our overseas promotional and staff costs also go up. We're making more inventory purchases in foreign currencies to counter that.\"\nThe post Nintendo president says no Switch price hike is coming appeared first on Destructoid.",

Private Division has signed Weta Workshop to a new publishing agreement, for a new game set in J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth.\nWeta Workshop is a well-known effects and prop company that worked on Peter Jackson's adaptation of The Lord of the Rings. The company founded an interactive game division in 2014, and now is tackling The Lord of the Rings in game form.\n\"It's a privilege to create a new game set in Middle-earth, especially one that's so different from what fans have played previously,\" said Amie Wolken, head of interactive at Weta Workshop, in a statement. \"As fans ourselves, we're excited for gamers to explore Middle-earth in a way they never have before, and introduce new fans to the magic of The Lord of the Rings.\"\nDetails on the new project are scarce, as it's still in early development. No release date is set yet. But Private Division says the game is expected to launch sometime during Take-Two's 2024 fiscal year. More details will arrive sometime in the future.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQ7aLU6rHLk\nMiddle-earth's back on the menu, boys\nPrivate Division is a publishing arm of Take-Two Interactive, and has been behind some notable games like OlliOlli World and The Outer Worlds. The company also acquired OlliOlli developer Roll7. It will also publish Ori developer Moon Studios' next game.\nThere are a few different Lord of the Rings projects in development. Whether you like to sneak around as a sneaky little Gollum on a quest for his precious, or dig into a survival-type game, there are a few Middle-earth projects to watch. We'll see what Weta brings to the table when it's ready to share more about its own interactive LOTR project.\nThe post Private Division and Weta Workshop sign deal for new game set in Middle-earth appeared first on Destructoid.",

This newest one comes straight from the game's official Twitter account, showcasing how gigantic this area is by looking down on it from a grand mountain, then swooping down on it.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK9T8jBmebc\nThe only requirement for unlocking the Island Sanctuary is completing the Endwalker (6.0) main story (MSQ)\nWhile the sequence for the Island Sanctuary is really brief in the official 6.2 trailer above (it's at roughly 20 seconds in), the below tweet gives us a lot more to work with.\nOperating a lot like a player housing zone (but not quite, as there's no traditional housing there), the Island Sanctuary will have independent controls and menu options, and serve as a relaxing respite between dungeon dives. It's framed heavily after farming simulators, with crops to manage, and the ability to drop minions on your island.\nAll of this will arrive on August 23, when Final Fantasy XIV patch 6.2 is live. That's just one day away from the massive Genshin Impact 3.0 update. It'll be a busy week!

The couldn't be simpler teaser merely consisted of a flash of the South Park Digital Studios logo, complete with a sample of rad dad Randy Marsh screaming \"HOT! HOT! HOT! HOT!\"\nY'know, from that episode where he did a giant turd... or something.\nNo gameplay footage, platforms, nor a release window were revealed, and we do not know whether the new game will continue in the point-and-click, turn-based battle tradition of Ubisoft's previous releases South Park: The Stick of Truth (2014) and its sequel South Park: The Fractured but Whole (2017). At this point, perhaps the only thing we can guarantee is that Stan and the boys' newest adventure will probably give global censors plenty of troubled nights.\nThe new South Park game is currently in development at South Park Digital Studios for THQ Nordic.

The ad, which quickly became widespread on social media, points to the two newcomers being DC anti-hero Black Adam and Stripe, the malevolent antagonist of Joe Dante's 1984 horror-comedy, Gremlins.\nhttps://twitter.com/IronWolfNet_/status/1559045986156089344?s=20&t=s8OORNqs-xQfHhE6_en-Ag\nDebuting way back in 1945, and under the license of Fawcett Comics, Black Adam was an arch enemy of Shazam! (then still \"Captain Marvel\"). Originally an ancient Egyptian predecessor of Shazam, DC Comics has readapted Black Adam time and again as a frequent villain, sometimes anti-hero, and othertimes straight hero. Perhaps one of the single most alliance-jumping characters in comic book history, Black Adam will soon make his big-screen debut in a new movie, portrayed by Dwayne Johnson.\nStripe is the closest Gremlins has to an antagonist, given the character's nature as the self-appointed alpha of the mischievous monsters. A clone of good guy Mogwai Gizmo, birthed after the latter was splashed with water, Stripe leads his brethren on a Christmas rampage through the town of Kingston Falls, afforded a disgusting new form after tricking owner Billy Peltzer into feeding him after midnight.\nYou're already singing the theme tune, aren't you?\nMultiVersus open beta is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms. You can check out the official season one patch notes, complete with their respective nerfs and buffs, on the official website.\nThe post Leaked ad appears to reveal two new MultiVersus characters appeared first on Destructoid.",

Hybrid Heaven is metallic corridors from eyebrows to toe-hairs. But something about the way he was enjoying it was infectious.\nAfter he completed it, he told me that “he probably wouldn’t have tolerated it without save states.” That is not glowing praise, but the experience was enough to keep Hybrid Heaven rolling around in my head for years until I finally found it for a reasonable price. By now, the game has been built up in my mind that I almost had to play through the entire thing. Good or bad.\n\n…",

This week Square Enix and Navigator Games announced that they're collaborating on an Avatar: The Last Airbender mobile game for Android and iOS, which is launching in Canada, South Africa, and Sweden this month ahead of a wider release.\nThe game, titled Avatar: Generations, will be a free-to-play RPG that will include squad-based battles and in-game adventure sequences (whatever that means), according to GameSpot. Players will be able to explore an open world, as well as relive iconic story moments from the show as well. We can also expect to see all of our favorite characters like Aang, Katara, Sokka, Toph, Suki, Zuko, Appa, and Momo. Future updates will give players access to Avatar Kyoshi, Korra, Roku, and explore all four of the nations.\n\nSquare Enix and Navigator put up an official website for the Avatar: Generations, although it's basically empty as of now, so it's worth coming back to in a bit when they release more information. There's also no hint as to when the full release of Generations might be, but considering it's a mobile launch, odds are it won't take as long as the typical game releases we're used to.\nI'm honestly shocked that the games industry hasn't given ATLA more love up until this point, considering how big and enthusiastic the fanbase is. I'm sure most of us would prefer a full AAA treatment over an Avatar mobile game, but it's a good place to start.\nThere have certainly been some good mobile games based on bigger franchises in the past few years — Fallout Shelter being chief among them. Hopefully if Generations does well, some of the bigger studios will catch on to the potential that this franchise has to make some really kickass games.\nThe post An Avatar: The Last Airbender mobile game is launching this month appeared first on Destructoid.",

That's a delay of roughly four-ish months. As for why, KeokeN Interactive released a statement alongside the news, citing that the game needs more time to be the best it can possibly be. \nAn update on the release date of Deliver Us Mars: pic.twitter.com/1SrFqjL3zm\nAugust 15, 2022\nFor more about Deliver Us Mars, read about its reveal from earlier this year.

This includes titles like Disney Dreamlight Valley, Marvel's Midnight Suns, Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, and even a \"sneak peek at the upcoming ensemble game from Skydance New Media.\" \nJUST ANNOUNCED: Watch the Disney & Marvel GAMES SHOWCASE on Friday, September 9 – live from #D23Expo 2022! https://t.co/uZcDYdUZKA pic.twitter.com/RJ67ooTR2F\nAugust 15, 2022\nYou might recognize Skydance New Media as the studio where former Uncharted series director Amy Hennig works as president. Connecting those dots means the sneak peek at the upcoming ensemble game from Skydance New Media is the first sneak peek of Hennig's new game, which she revealed as a narrative-driven, action-adventure game last year. \nConsidering it's an ensemble game, it could be any number of famous Marvel squads or families. However, it's probably a safe bet to assume it won't be the Avengers since Crystal Dynamic's Avengers is only two years old and still getting updates. We also know it won't be the Midnight Suns, as XCOM developer Firaxis is developing that. I'm hoping Hennig's game is based on the X-Men, but since it's an ensemble game, it could be something like the Inhumans, the Fantastic Four, or even the New Avengers, too. Only time will tell, but fortunately, we have less than a month of waiting to go because the Disney and Marvel Games Showcase airs on Sept. 9. \nWhat Marvel heroes do you hope Hennig's game features?

          "description": "Private Division, a publishing arm under the Take-Two Interactive umbrella, has signed a publishing agreement with Wētā Workshop to publish the studio’s new Lord of the Rings game. \nWētā Workshop is the VFX studio behind The Lord of the Rings trilogy directed by Peter Jackson, and in 2014, it founded a video game division. That team is now developing a “new game set in the Middle-earth universe of J.R.R. Tolkien,” according to a press release. Middle-earth Enterprises has licensed the literary works of the series to Wētā Workshop, too, giving the studio “the broadest creative license to interpret the underlying lore of the books.” \n“We are thrilled to partner with Wētā Workshop to publish a game set in such an extraordinary and celebrated universe,” Private Division head Michael Worosz writes in a press release. “The Lord of the Rings IP is home to so many remarkable stories, and no entity is better equipped than the team at Wētā Workshop to create a distinctive, new Middle-earth gaming experience.” \nWētā Workshop’s gaming lead, Amie Wolken, says it's a privilege to create a new game set in Middle-earth, especially one that’s going to be “so different from what fans have played previously.” \n“As a fan ourselves, we’re excited for gamers to explore Middle-earth in a way they never have before, and introduce new fans to the magic of The Lord of the Rings,” Wolken writes in the press release. \nThis new Lord of the Rings game does not yet have a title and is early in development. It doesn’t have a release date either, but it’s expected to launch sometime during Take-Two’s Fiscal Year 2024 (April 2023 - March 2024). \nWhile waiting to learn more about this game, check out the latest gameplay from The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, which was recently delayed out of its Sept. 1 release date by a few months. Watch this teaser from the upcoming Amazon Middle-earth TV show, The Lord of the Rings:​ The Rings of Power, after that. \nWhat kind of game do you hope this ends up being?

Over the next few weeks, we’ll be covering the history and lore of Capcom’s premiere action franchise, and this episode takes aim at the lauded yet somewhat polarizing Devil May Cry 4. \nDevil May Cry 4 took the series to a new generation of hardware, including Xbox for the first time. That's only one of the many firsts for this entry. Capcom moved Dante aside to place newcomer Nero in the starring role, who brought his demon arm Devil Bringer as the new centerpiece mechanic. Dante wasn't completely shunned, however; players control him during the adventure's questionably designed back half. In this episode, we'll discuss DMC 4's bizarre 2005 reveal, Capcom's reasoning behind Nero's conception, the fan reaction to the Xbox launch, and what it's really like to visit Fortuna's inspiration, Vatican City. \nJoin hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7) and the returning host of The Great Game Debate podcast Wes Bates (@GreatGameDeb8), as we unpack Nero's big debut. \nIf you’d like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com.

Of course, it’s not a 1-to-1 recreation, but Infinity Ward says Farm 18’s center, which is a large shoot house, was inspired by Modern Warfare’s Shoothouse.\nCheck it out for yourself below: \nWelcome to Farm 18. Location: [classified]. Shoothouse optional. #ModernWarfare2 #IntelDrops pic.twitter.com/OkZuuwjPXD\nAugust 11, 2022\nAs you can see, the map looks like it’s going to be a great time. Players looking to play it safe can stick to the outside, using the overgrown brush to conceal them while stalking the level’s perimeter. Those looking for a riskier fight can head into the central warehouse, where they’ll find themselves in the Shoothouse-inspired part of Farm 18. \nFor more about Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, check out the game’s first extended gameplay reveal from earlier this summer, and then read our preview of the game after checking it out in June.

We haven't heard much of a peep about the game since its reveal last summer, making us wonder if a delay was on the horizon.\nMarco, Eri, Fio, and Tarma are tinkering away to make #MetalSlugTactics as explosive as possible on release, but the squad needs a bit more time in the shop to prepare for the battles ahead.

The game, developed by Leikir Studio, transforms the series’ explosive run-and-gun action into a tile-based tactics experience that retains Metal Slug’s signature style and tone. Although turn-based, units still wield classic Metal Slug weapons and can be improved by unlocking abilities and perks on a skill tree.\nWe’ll have to wait a while longer to see how well Metal Slug translates to this new template.

The game is the debut by Inflexion Games, a team consisting of former Bioware developers, including ex-general manager Aaron Flynn. \nIn a message posted to Twitter, Inflexion explains it delayed the launch for two reasons. One, it’s migrating the game to Unreal Engine 5. Two, it needs the extra time to ensure it's polished and packed with content before players can begin testing it out. You can read Inflexion's full message below (click the image to enlarge). \nNightingale debuted during The Game Awards 2021 and is a PvE crafting and survival game that can be played alone or in co-op. Players find themselves stranded in a Victorian Gaslamp fantasy world connected by a network of portals. To survive, they’ll have to harvest materials such as wood and ore to construct weapons, equipment, and buildings. Jumping through portals transports players to new biomes such as deserts, swamps, and jungles. Nightingale’s appearance during this year’s Summer Game Fest introduced Realm Cards used to unlock new areas and influence the type of content, such as enemies and resources, they contain. \nSo far, Nightingale is only confirmed to launch for PC via Steam.",

Now we have our best look yet, featuring Persona 5 Royal running at 60 FPS on an Xbox Series X, thanks to Faz on YouTube, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. \nCheck it out for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Persona 5 Royal looks wildly different running at 60 FPS. Personally, and this is shocking for me to say, I think I prefer it running at 30 FPS. I was chatting with a friend about this last night, but the animation of the game and its general art style lend themselves well to 30 FPS. This remastered 60 FPS look almost takes away some of the shine from the game, giving characters and enemies a matte-like finish. Perhaps it will look better in the final release, but right now, I think I will stick to my PlayStation 4 version. \n[Source: Faz on YouTube via Video Games Chronicle]\nWhat do you think of the game running at 60 FPS?

The title was initially slated to arrive this year but will now launch in 2023. \nThe reason is that the team has decided to pivot and focus on launching another team-based shooter codenamed Project Discovery. A blog post written by Söderlund explains that Embark has several projects in development and that Discovery progressed so quickly that it seemingly caught up to Arc Raiders, presenting the team with the possibility of shipping two games within the same timeframe. However, doing would've been more than the small team can handle. \n“For a young, relatively small studio like ours, releasing two games in short succession would have strained our teams and resources, many of which are shared between the two projects.” Söderlund explains. \n“As such, we decided to let Project Discovery be our studio’s first game to market, pushing Arc Raiders to a 2023 release. It’s a decision that will also allow us to expand and refine the Arc Raiders experience.”\nOutside of being a team-based first-person shooter, little is known about Project Discovery. The concept art posted above hints that it's set in the current day or perhaps the near future. Söderlund promises to reveal more details “very soon.” \nArc Raiders made its debut during the 2021 Game Awards and will be a free-to-play cooperative shooter where players work together to battle mechanical creatures from space. It will launch for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

There’s also Sonic Prime, Netflix’s animated series that, while disconnected from the film universe, provides another avenue to enjoy the Blue Blur on the small screen.

The event is meant to celebrate over 30 years of Sonic the Hedgehog and includes a new Sonic-themed level and new outfits. \nThe new level is called \"Bean Hill Zone\" and tasks the Fall Guys beans with collecting as many rings as possible to win special rewards. If players earn 200 points, they get a \"Bean Hill Zone\" nameplate. Earning 400 points yields 200 kudos, 600 points get a Bonus Rings Pattern outfit, 800 points gives 400 kudos, and 1,000 points gives you access to Sonic's iconic sneakers.\nThose aren't the only rewards you can snatch up during this event, though. New costumes for Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Super Sonic, and Dr. Robotnik are all available in the store during the event. You can also buy the Sonic Foot Tap emote.\nThis isn't Sonic's first appearance in Fall Guys as a costume. Back in 2020, players could pick up this Sonic costume.

That means it will now arrive sometime before March 31, 2023.\nThe game’s Twitter account confirmed the delay with a message, embedded below, that also revealed that the game will now have a staggered release. Midnight Suns will come to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC first within the fiscal year. The PS4, Xbox One, and Switch versions arrive sometime after that. \nImportant update from the Midnight Suns team pic.twitter.com/79yVfzpDED\nAugust 8, 2022\nWhile Midnight Suns will only face a five-month setback at most (for current-gen, at least) and could technically still arrive in 2022, seeing it suffer another delay is disappointing nonetheless. The game was first announced almost a year ago at last year’s Gamescom. It graced Game Informer’s cover that month and was first scheduled to launch this March before being delayed to October. A reimagining of the Rise of the Midnight Sons comic event, players control a team of occult heroes like Blade, Magik, and Nico Minoru and Avengers like Iron Man, Captain America, and Spider-Man to battle Lilith, the mother of all demons. Midnight Suns' turn-based combat utilizes a card system for selecting commands, and between battles players explore a headquarters where they can socialize and bond with their teammates. \nWe played the first four hours of Marvel’s Midnight Suns in June and wrote up seven takeaways based on our time with it.

The update will also be available on PC.\nFor the unfamiliar, rollback netcode is a system that provides a nearly lag-free online experience, hence why it's always a highly desirable feature in the fighting game community. During EVO 2022, DBFZ producer Tomoko Hiroki shared that the current-gen versions will support rollback netcode, whereas the PS4 and Xbox One editions will not. There's no release window for upgraded ports, but a message from Bandai Namco's Twitter account states we'll learn more information later and that it will take \"some time\" before the system is finished. \nWhile that's bad news for those who don't own a PS5 or Xbox Series X/S, Bandai Namco is at least planning some sort of upgrade path for existing game owners on current consoles (such as Smart Delivery on Xbox). There's no mention if the Switch version will receive a rollback netcode.  \nHiroki also announced that Dragon Ball FighterZ is now content-complete, meaning it will not receive any more fighters or balance updates. The game received three DLC fighter packs during its lifetime that added over a dozen characters to its roster. \nDragon Ball FighterZ first launched in January 2018 and was hailed as one of the best fighting games of the decade and arguably the best Dragon Ball video game period.

          "description": "Nintendo has revealed that it will live stream a Splatoon 3 Direct this week. \nMore specifically, it will begin at 6 a.m. PT on Wednesday, Aug. 10, and will feature roughly 30 minutes of updates. Check out the announcement for yourself below:\nTune in on August 10 at 6 a.m. PT for a livestreamed #Splatoon3 Direct presentation. Join us in the Splatlands for roughly 30 minutes of updates! pic.twitter.com/iFfaU3V6vM\nAugust 8, 2022\nAs you can see, there’s not much else to glean from this news. If you’re the kind of person who anticipates game-focused Directs to reveal information about other anticipated titles, I would say you should not do that with this one. It seems very much a “we’re only going to talk about Splatoon 3” kind of Direct announcement. Of course, I could be wrong, but you know, expectations and all that. \nHowever, if you’re a Splatoon fan, it sounds like Wednesday will be an excellent day. Not only are you getting new Splatoon 3 details and information, but “roughly 30” minutes of it – that’s a lot! As for what to expect, new weapons, characters, maps, and story details will likely be showcased. This will probably be the last Splatoon 3-focused Direct, too, considering the game hits Switch less than a month after it on Sept. 9. \nWhile waiting for Wednesday’s Direct, check out this Splatoon 3-themed Switch console and then listen to this new punk rock-inspired track from Splatoon 3’s soundtrack. After that, check out the latest Splatoon 3 gameplay trailer. \nAre you excited about Splatoon 3? Let us know in the comments below!",

          "description": "SNK revealed during the Evo 2022 fighting game tournament held in Las Vegas that a new Fatal Fury game has been greenlit and is now in development. \nThis news comes from a short teaser trailer that showcases a new look at some Fatal Fury art alongside the following message, which plays on screen: “The city of legend still breathes. Hungry wolves back on the prowl. A new destiny hidden in darkness. New Fatal Fury/Garou green-lit.” \nCheck it out for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, SNK didn’t reveal much else, and if you’re a Fatal Fury fan, you probably have many questions. Will this new game adopt a 3D art style like other modern fighting franchises such as Street Fighter 6, or will it stick with traditional 2D art? Which fighters are returning? Will there be new fighters? Only time will tell. \nIf you’re unfamiliar with Fatal Fury, you might recognize the name Terry Bogard, who regained some popularity after his inclusion in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. He’s the protagonist of the Fatal Fury fighting game series. If you don’t recognize that name either, nobody can blame you – the last Fatal Fury game came out 23 years ago, with Fatal Fury: Mark of the Wolves’ release in 1999. \nIt’s unclear when we’ll hear more about this new Fatal Fury game, but it’s nice to know at least a game is in development for the classic fighting franchise. \nAre you excited about a new Fatal Fury game?

She first appeared in Super Street Fighter IV. Before SF6, her primary motivation was exacting revenge on M. Bison, but since his fall in Street Fighter V, she now waits for a new motivation to arrive. If you’re a fan of Juri, don’t sweat – she retains many of her past moves in Street Fighter 6, although you can expect them to have “different properties” now. \nFor example, Fuhajin returns and sees Juri perform an upwards kick that stores Fuha stocks upon completion.

          "description": "When Nintendo first introduced the Switch Online classic games catalog featuring NES games, I bemoaned the announcement of what I saw as an inferior content delivery system. Not only were we asked to play with a substantially smaller library of games than what we had on Wii or Wii U, but I didn't even have the option to buy those games. Instead, we were given a small library of games from a single console with no way to carry over entitlements from previous purchases or actually own the classic games I was playing. I felt Nintendo Switch Online was a worse service in every way, even as Nintendo expanded the offerings to include a robust NES and SNES library.\nThen in 2020, something changed.

          "description": "Saturnalia is an upcoming indie survival horror with one of the most interesting visual styles I’ve seen in the genre in a minute. \nDeveloped by Italy-based studio Santa Ragione, Saturnalia is influenced heavily by the folklore of Sardinia, Italy, and inspired by Italian Giallo horror films (typically more horror-esque mystery thrillers). In it, you control four different characters, all connected through a mysterious storyline that ties back to the “haunting traditions” of an ancient village. \n“The village itself is an elaborate maze with no two iterations being precisely the same – you will have to explore and solve mysteries of the game largely unguided,” the game’s website reads. “Die, and watch the village reconfigure itself into a new form. Solve puzzles and open shortcuts to new areas with tools and items you find along the way, unlocking every piece of the story with different characters, each suited for another aspect of exploration and investigation.” \nAll of that sounds great, but Saturnalia's unique art style makes me most excited. It’s like a mix of stop-motion and sketchbook, which looks like it’ll lend itself nicely to the game's horror elements. Check it out for yourself below:\n\n\nSanta Ragione is the studio behind games like Fotonica, MirrorMoon EP, and Wheels of Aurelia. Saturnalia does not yet a launch date, but it will hit PC exclusively via the Epic Games Store sometime in 2022. The studio is planning to launch the game on other platforms, but the timing on that remains TBA. \nWhat do you think of Saturnalia? Let us know in the comments below!",

While the bundle was praised for bringing Sonic 1, Sonic 2, Sonic 3 & Knuckles, and Sonic CD to modern platforms with various gameplay enhancements and other additions, it was also heavily criticized. Various bugs, mislabeled titles in the in-game museum, and overall stability (particularly with the PC version) frustrated the player base as they waited for Sega to fix the problems. This week, Sega released that long-awaited patch, addressing those problems and more, hopefully stabilizing the compilation and making the overall experience more enjoyable.\nThe two biggest items this patch addresses include fixing issues with the game crashing and one of the most annoying bugs of the year: Tails falling behind in Sonic 2 and constantly jumping instead of respawning on the player – we can finally turn off mute when playing Sonic 2. The patch also includes fixes for sound bugs, menu and controller issues, museum mislabels, and data-saving issues. Unfortunately, the replacement music in Ice Cap, Carnival Night, and Launch Base remain in place. \nThe patch is available to download now for all platforms. Sonic Origins arrived on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on June 23. For more on the speedy selection of games, check out our review here.",
