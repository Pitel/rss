Responsible for some of our favourite games ever, the possibilities had us excited. However, it seems the announcement has slipped out a little early, as Gematsu has spotted \"unused images\" on publisher Happinet's Tokyo Game Show 2022.\nTreasure's game in question is Radiant Silvergun, a 1998 arcade and Sega Saturn game that eventually got a worldwide release on Xbox 360 back in 2011. Many imported the game back when it was first released and claimed that this shmup kickstarted the genre's revival in the late '90s. So, we're talking about what might be one of the best shmups of all time? Count us in.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

But this game offers more than just creature collecting. Between farming, making friends, and busting a move, players are responsible for restoring life to Badgetown and its surrounding areas through the power of the 'Oobnet'.\nAt the beginning of the game, the player is swiftly taken through character creation and a brief backstory of how they ended up in Badgetown. At first, the story declares that the player is searching for a new lease of life after their previous became tedious. Rather than sticking around, they've packed their things and headed to a more promising outlet — somewhere where Ooblets, the creatures in which the game gets its name, are a-plenty, and adventure isn't taboo.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Stories always came first for the team at NOVECT. The critical and commercial success of The House In Fata Morgana surprised many upon the title’s international release, including the developers themselves. Headlines were made when the game shot temporarily to the spot of most critically-acclaimed game of all time on Metacritic, despite being still relatively under the radar beforehand. Fata Morgana first released to the public in Japan in 2012, and gained a cult following before its eventual successful international release. The reason for it's acclaim? Storytelling. Every single review praised Fata Morgana's surprising and enthralling twists and turns as what made this visual novel a must-play title, even for non-fans of the genre.\r\n\n\r\nAt the time development started, NOVECT were less a development studio, and more of a group of univeristy friends with minimal coding experience but a love for telling stories; a hobby project run by friends on the side of university and normal jobs inside and out of the games industry, only becoming a fully-fledged studio later down the line. Fast forward to today, NOVECT are a firmly-established indie developer with games and multimedia adaptations of their work under their belt, and new project still mysteriously known as \"Project Code Name 'M'\" now in the works. Originally starting development in 2019 and announced earlier this year, Project M had its first public demo at this month’s Bitsummit indie gaming showcasing in Kyoto.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Even though you can craft your own buildings and gather materials, you don’t need to have played any gathering or crafting classes. With a base to customise, crops to tend to and a pasture full of animals to pet, it’s easy to see why comparisons were drawn to other farming games such as Stardew Valley.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "We've got a pretty good line in interesting folk traditions here at RPS. I grew up in a county where staying up all night at the stone circle to welcome the Summer Solstice was an annual tradition (later augmented by a woman wearing antlers offering a selection of downers and hallucinogens), and as a child I had an unnecessary encounter with the Salisbury Hob-Nob. For the past few years Alice0 has gone to the Burryman's Parade, gracing us with pictures of that most wholesome gentleman. Rural traditions are fun if you're part of them, but to outsiders they can be unsettling at best. \nThis is relevant to my thinking about Saturnalia, an upcoming survival horror game by Italian studio Santa Ragione, where a small group of outsiders try to escape a village on the night of an ancient ritual. I've been playing a preview build of Saturnalia for the last week or so, and also got to talk about it with the studio director Pietro Righi Riva. \"I usually tell people, 'Oh, you should make a game in like six months', and I have tried to do that in the past,\" he tells me. \"This one just kind of got out of hand. I found an email yesterday, as I was looking for finishing the credits, about me discussing some story items in April 2017.\" And, while I am sure that most developers don't wish they'd been making a video game in the middle of the pandemic, I think the extra time may have allowed Santa Ragione to make something excellent.\nRead more",

If only mere words could convey just how much “like RimWorld” Stranded: Alien Dawn is – other 3D-ified clones exist, like last year’s Going Medieval, but here, even the exact spaceship-wrecking premise matches that of Ludeon Studios' seminal survival sim. \r\n\n \nRead more",

But in a surprising turn of events, I left thinking the game was a real highlight of my time in Cologne's multi-hall maze of excellent people and overpriced schnitzel.\nAnd most importantly, the guns didn't annoy me at all! In fact, their craic contributed a great deal to my enjoyment of the strangest FPS I've played in a while - one where I was forever grinning at the screen like an idiot. If you're a fan of Rick And Morty from before it got weird to be a fan of Rick And Morty (or Squanch Games' back catalogue, or general bizarro laughs), this is one for the wishlist.\nRead more",

Part deckbuilder, part roguelike and part tower defence, this is a real-time strategy game played by the seat of your pants, where a rolling deck of cards determines not only what kind of defences you can build, but also what buffs, spells and additional forces you can deploy to help defend your keep from the oncoming hordes.

The Samsung Odyssey Ark, for the unfamiliar, is a kind of all-in-one entertainment screen: a mammoth 55in Mini LED panel that can act as a desktop gaming monitor or living room TV, complete with honking great speakers and built-in support for all the big game streaming services so you can play on it without a PC or console. Unlike other monitors of this magnitude, it can also rotate into portrait mode, leaving the top curve towering over you like an unsympathetic Victorian headmaster. \r\n\n\r\nI actually enjoy a touch of design madness creeping into the occasional piece of PC gear, regardless of whether it can hang with the best gaming monitors that sensible people might buy.

A game like Victoria 3, where the whole point is making decisions that have country-wide effects and outcomes years in the future, is essentially operating in a different language to any I understand.\nI'm trying to learn new languages, though, so it's not an unwelcome challenge. The problem is that previewing Victoria 3 is quite an advanced level to dive in, the Paradox GSG equivalent of being a live translator for a UN summit when you're only just about able to read the French version of The Famous Five. In a presentation before I and others were let loose on the better part of a week with the game, it was claimed that Victoria 3 is the best yet for onboarding newcomers, with a deep and detailed tutorial system. And to that I say: kinda. Luckily, the AI in Victoria 3 is so advanced it's better at playing the game than I am.\nRead more",

Hyenas never gave me a chance.\nI sat in a 20-minute presentation of the game and tried my level best to understand SEGA's stab at a live-service FPS. Instead, I exited the booth with whiplash... and a sense of curiosity. Somewhere inside the game's insufferable tone is a kernel of cleverness, I just need to get my mitts on it to confirm my suspicions.

This latest rumination on voyeurism also delves into storytelling, sex, death, religion, love, lust, lies, pretence (as distinct from acting), power and self. That's a lot to pack into the partial, out of order clips of three different films, which manage to span both decades and careers. The central figure is Marissa Marcel, an almost-star actor who made three movies before disappearing. So the question you strive to answer, by looking through unedited takes and rehearsal footage, is: what happened to Marissa Marcel?\nIn typical Barlow fashion, the entirety of the footage isn't easily spooled through. From one starting clip you're able to watch it, flick back and forth through the recording, and pause it to use the in-game search tool to focus on a face or object on screen. Selecting it will then take you to that face or a similar object in a different clip, and eventually you build up a much fuller catalogue of footage.\nNow. Immortality also talks quite a bit about sex, in various ways and for various reasons, and there is female nudity. So yes, you can enhance! Zoom! on a tit. And the game will take you to another clip featuring a similar tit. Ba-dum, tsh!\nRead more",

But despite both of these events, it's been difficult to ascertain what the game actually, well, is. Aside from being a real-time strategy spin-off, there's been nothing else to scan with our eyeballs for more info.\nColour me intrigued, then, as I sat in a quickfire presentation at this year's Gamescom and bore witness to some mythical gameplay. I can now report that what Minecraft Legends appears to be is as mix of real-time strategy and building, made all the more approachable by being set in Minecraft's colourful cube-verse.\nRead more",

Since then, development changed hands like a baton at the Olympic relay; Yager left a year later, to be replaced by Sumo Digital, only for Sumo Digital to leave and be replaced by Dambuster Studios. Usain Bolt hasn't expressed interest yet, but there's time.\nSo going into a 20-minute hands-on with the game in the year 2022, I was a bit apprehensive. What sort of Frankenstinian horror awaited me behind closed doors? But, far from a shambling mess, what I played was a zombie 'em up that seemed close to what Graham saw in 2014, only polished up to a surprising, bloody gloss.\nRead more",

Nonetheless, The Great War: Western Front, a combination of macro planning and tactical RTS battling revealed this week at Gamescom, has elected to lean right into WW1’s complexities and difficulties rather than dance around them.\n\r\nDevelopers Petroglyph have gone for historical accuracy in various ways, senior designer Chris Becker and audio director Frank Klepacki explain to me at a hands-off demo in Cologne. The soundtrack will even include licensed music from the era. But something they want to really hammer home is the brutality of the war: territory won’t be won in heroic pushes but slowly and bloodily, while collapsing morale is as much a danger as any advancing army.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Matthew isn't here this week, which means we are very well behaved. I talk about BioWare games a normal amount, and Nate tries (and, in fairness, succeeds) to find a way to make moral choices a thing that you can apply to the sort of games he likes. Not Age Of Empires II this time, though. \nBecause there's no Matthew, I change the Cavern Of Lies into a cavern of moral judgement for Nate, and make him run a gauntlet of some of the most important choices in Dragon Age Inquisition with no context. He turns out to be both authoritarian and kind of wholesome as an Inquisitor.\nRead more",

          "description": "Revealed at Gamescom Opening Night Live, Atlas Fallen is an upcoming action RPG being developed by Deck 13 Interactive, the folks behind The Surge games. It's eschewing the robotic antics of its predecessor in favour of a Middle Eastern-inspired semi-open world filled with towering blocks of sand, rolling dunes, and mahoosive beasties.\nI managed to see a brief 30-minute presentation of the game here at Gamescom, which gave off the impression that it's shaping up to satisfy those craving a AA title to plonk on their shelf. I've got to say that in action that combat really looks good, too.\nRead more",

          "description": "\"The thing we're doing with The Dark Pictures is exploring different sub genres of horror,\" explains game director Tom Heaton. The Dark Pictures Anthology is, well, a horror anthology, each a compact standalone scary game where you explore and deal with QTEs and hazardous choices, in the vein of Supermassive's smash hit Until Dawn. The idea, says Heaton, is that each one takes one or two horror sub-genres and mines them, maybe subverting the tropes here and there. Up next is The Devil In Me, inspired by the infamous Chicago serial killer H. H. Holmes. \n\"What I think we decided with The Dark Pictures games early on was that the next game in the series would be very different from the last game, because we want to keep it fresh, we want to give the audience new,\" Heaton explains. So, after a zombie ghost ship in Man Of Medan, the psychological witch hauntings in Little Hope, and military squad vs. vampire aliens in House Of Ashes, Heaton pitches The Devil In Me as kind of Saw meets The Shining. It's a serial killer slasher in a weirdo hotel, and it has a true crime element. And I have to say, it's probably the most excited I've been for a Dark Pictures entry.\nRead more",

In v r ^2, or v r squared, everything is out in the open on display. Take a gander at the trailer below.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Park Beyond, an upcoming theme park management sim in the vein of a juiced up Rollercoaster Tycoon, is trying to balance two slightly opposed teams in its target audience. There are people who love doing the management bits - the bean-counting, optimising the amount of salt on fries to make people thirsty and buy more drinks, paying close attention to demographics and average spends and that sort of kidney*. Then there are people who want to design a park full of cool-ass rides and different themed zones, a true magical wonderland. Inside this Park Beyond are two wolves, in other words, and each needs a different but equally robust set of tools to wrangle.\nAfter some hands on with an early build of Park Beyond, I have a little more faith that Limbic Entertainment are going to be able to pull it off. The toolset for building a rollercoast is, in particular, impressive. It's never been so easy to make a ride that breaks both the laws of physics and the laws of health and saftey. The coasters in this game are an absolute menace. In a good way.\nRead more",

I’m already emotionally scarred from the giant bug puppets in Honey, I Shrunk The Kids, and it’s the reason I won’t ever play Grounded (soz Obsidian).\nThankfully, Tinykin takes a more whimsical approach to this hellish situation. It’s a sci-fi adventure platformer where you and a tiny alien army explore a giant house and, as a bite-size summary, it’s excellent.

In fact I get the distinct impression it was one of the best, if not the one that most distilled the series' essence.\nThat essence has made its way into Blossom Tales II, a charming light adventure game in the classic \"going on an adventure\" sense rather than the \"rubbing every item on every other item until you're allowed to play again\" genre sense.\nYou're playing out a story playfully told by your grandfather, who's cast you as the wee hero of a village out to rescue your brother from the sinister Minotaur King. Both of you occasionally interject, sometimes prompting a decision that changes the game a little as your granddad amends things to your liking. It doesn't go to the full meta-narrative lengths of a Juarez Gunslinger with it, but it's a cute touch and keeps the framing relevant.\nRead more",

A recent financial report from developer IO Interactive appears to suggest that the previously teased Project 007 may still be some years away from receiving its release date.\nAs noted on Twitter by DarkDetective, the report notes that the Hitman developer is on track for a relatively successful fiscal year — predicting revenue in the region of $65 million USD — but that the company is bracing itself for at least two further years of decreased profit, due to a lack of any new releases and extended production periods.

          "description": "Say hello to the newest addition to the Paldea region\nFollowing several posts teasing the news, we're seeing the newest addition to the Paldea region. Grafaiai is a new Pokemon debuting in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet.\nGrafaiai is categorized as the \"Toxic Monkey\" Pokemon. It's naturally a Poison/Normal Type, and is pretty tiny.\nAccording to the Pokemon page, Grafaiai is a moody Pokemon with a \"fastidious\" disposition. It's a bit of a loner, and usually gets caught up in territorial fights with other Pokemon.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yrrF83tnY0\nGrafaiai is nocturnal, and covers its hands in poison to mark patterns on trees as part of securing its territory. This poisonous saliva can paralyze Bug Pokemon, which Grafaiai can then collect up. Better keep your Butterfree away from it!\nThe saliva can change color based on what Grafaiai eats, and becomes concentrated when the little guy senses danger. I'm guessing by the name that Grafaiai is based on an Aye-Aye, which also forages for food and has incredibly long fingers.\n\nAnother addition to Pokemon Scarlet and Violet\nThis adds to the list of new Pokemon arriving in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet. Alongside the Pokemon Grafaiai, we've also seen newcomers like Lechonk and Fidough, who both overtook the internet with their adorable designs.\nWhile Grafaiai doesn't seem to have the same ability to accost social media's attention, I think it's a neat design. And hey, another painter Pokemon to hang out with Smeargle.\nPokemon Scarlet and Violet are due to arrive on November 18 for the Nintendo Switch, with a host of features in tow. From riding a Legendary Pokemon as a bike to co-op adventures, it certainly seems like a very different Pokemon journey. Hopefully we'll see some more new Pokemon, and maybe even some neat new regional variants for Paldea, in the run-up to November.\nThe post New Pokemon Scarlet and Violet Pokemon revealed as Grafaiai appeared first on Destructoid.",

Right on: are we sure Nintendo got the announcement correct?\nAs spotted by NintendoSoup, the upcoming duo of Pokemon Scarlet and Violet were lumped together as just Violet in the Singapore ad, which adorns every tray at this particular location (and likely more). Interestingly, the collab also involves a \"Charizard McPepper Burger,\" \"Eevee Pies,\" and \"Pikachu and Scorbunny Frappes.\" Oh, and it'll have a trading card game tie-in.\nThis silly snafu had me thinking about how much I appreciated a lot of high-level choices in Pokemon Legends. Of course, there's room for improvement there. But in addition to the new capture mechanic, the idea of just buying one game and being done with it was a relief, especially for completionists.\nThe continuation of the dual game method has become a hot-button issue in recent years, especially since the series moved off of its exclusive home on handhelds. \"More money\" is a chief contributor to keeping that gravy train rolling, but the original Red and Blue idea of encouraging trading via the community did make sense. But with cold online trading as commonplace, the logistics of pushing two versions with every generation makes less and less sense. It's likely not going to stop anytime soon, but more Legends releases would be a decent compromise.\nMcDonald's Pokemon Violet and Violet ad\n\nThe post McDonald’s Singapore store makes everyone’s dreams come true, advertises one Pokemon version appeared first on Destructoid.",

Unfortunately for Mia, her incredibly unlucky pals, and a particularly hapless dog, an ancient and malevolent evil descends upon the campsite, leading to demonic possession, cruel turns of fate, a storm of pure blood, and some truly hopeless and stomach-churning violence.\nhttps://twitter.com/EvilDeadTheGame/status/1565099350950383620?s=20&t=gOJ-POnrIQiwypAYC8XRww\nWhile Saber is yet to fully reveal Mia's in-game abilities, they have teased footage of her very nicely crafted character model, which captures the morose, no-nonsense personality of Mia, complete with her casual gothic style.

The publisher will host its event throughout one weekend, September 16 to 18.\nThe main show kicks off at 12 p.m. PT on Friday, September 16 on 3D Realms' Twitch and YouTube channels. There will be game reveals and updates, including news on Graven, Core Decay, and Ion Fury's expansion Aftershock.\nAlongside those, 3D Realms pals will be showing up to share some info too. Fulqrum, New Blood, HYPERSTRANGE, Dread XP, and Nightdive Studios will be sharing what's new. The showcase is expected to be more than an hour and a half long, highlighting both retro-inspired and contemporary FPS, and even some non-shooters.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-_etoZ9yko\nThe showcase will also include a LAN party in-person, in Aalborg, Denmark. And for those at home, a Steam sale and demo showcase will also run September 15 through 19, highlighting recently revealed titles, playable demos, and discounts on games.\nRealms deeper\nPrevious Realms Deep showcases have highlighted a decent mix of games, though it will most likely appeal to the old-school PC FPS fan the most. Games like the horror-themed shooter Cultic are due to make an appearance in some capacity, so if you like classic FPS action (a.k.a. \"boomer shooters\"), you'll probably find something to like here.\nThe showcase will extend into the weekend, too. 3D realms will be giving the spotlight to creators, developers, and personalities. Some independent games will also be taking the stage throughout the weekend too.\nAs the summer gaming news bonanza winds down, a demo showcase sounds pretty alright. Chances are high I'll find something interesting to put on my Steam wishlist during the weekend, and it's nice to be able to trial run a bunch of games without having to do all that travel.\nThe post 3D Realms is hosting its Realms Deep digital showcase in September appeared first on Destructoid.",

After initially looking like a late 2021 release, the sequel was bumped to May 2022, then pushed back again, to October 2022. Things happen.\nNow, there's another delay — but Endnight says it's the last time, and the new release date for Sons of the Forest, February 23, 2023, should stick. We also learned the price: $30.\nIn a short message relayed on Twitter, the developers said they've struggled to nail down the launch timing due to the game's scope. And rather than just spread the less-than-ideal news, they also attached a new 12-second gameplay clip.\nhttps://twitter.com/EndNightGame/status/1565012072681066496\nPreviously, Endnight said it hoped this would be the \"next step in survival games.\"\nHere's the latest summary: \"Sent to find a missing billionaire on a remote island, you find yourself in a cannibal-infested hellscape. Craft, build, and struggle to survive, alone or with friends, in this terrifying new open-world survival horror simulator.\"\nThe fleshy freakos will have to wait until next year. As much as Sons of the Forest would've hit the spot in October alongside all of my other annual horror media, it's important to come out strong in 2023. The Forest really grew its base on PS4, so if you're waiting for news on the console front, it's gonna be a long one. For now, the PC version is the focus.\nThe post Sons of the Forest slips to February 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Nowadays, the series has expanded beyond just the games, we've also released movies, merchandise, run eSports events, and done numerous collaborations to reach a wider audience. Seeing people from all kinds of backgrounds interacting with the series in its various forms has been a momentous driving force in keeping us going as we work towards its future.\"\n\nRight now, the main purpose of the site is sharing stories, via a social system of sorts. Capcom is collecting \"comment cards,\" which are like little information squares with someone's name (or alias), an avatar, and a little blurb about themselves and their favorite aspects of the Street Fighter series. Current and former Capcom employees, including Shuhei Matsumoto and Hideaki Itsuno, have contributed.\nThe other functionality of the site includes a history lesson page, dating back to the original Street Fighter game in 1987, through 2023's Street Fighter 6. While you can't click each game to get a full breakdown, select entries do have a separate pop-up page, including Street Fighter 1, 2, Alpha, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\nThe Street Fighter 35th anniversary landing is a cute little page, and no doubt is helping in terms of easing the wait for the next iteration. After cruising through a lot of these games, I can't help but want to play them again.\nThe post There’s a Street Fighter 35th anniversary website, and it has lots of great art appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Darkest of Souls\nIn the latest in a seemingly endless line of major industry acquisitions, Chinese conglomerate Tencent and Japan's Sony Interactive Entertainment have collectively bought just over 30% of controlling stock from stellar studio FromSoftware — as announced by FromSoft parent Kadokawa Group.\nTencent subsidiary Sixjoy Hong Kong will take ownership of 16.25% of the purchased shares, while SIE will sire the remaining 14.69%. It is important to note that Kadokawa Group remains the majority shareholder in FromSoftware, owning a huge 69.66% of the Dark Souls studios stock. This \"third-party allotment\" of shares has been allowed in order to bolster FromSoft's financial resources, as well as facilitate its growth in overseas territories. The deal is expected to close September 7, 2022.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOrtKh8Vv3g\n\"FromSoftware is driving the Game Business as it has continually been creating world-famous works, such as Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice and Elden Ring, leveraging its advanced game IP development strength,\" wrote Kadokawa in its officious sales document. \"With an eye on further expansion of the Game Business, the Group recognizes the enhancement of capabilities for the creation, development and deployment of game IP as one of the Group’s highest priorities. In line with this policy, the Company has decided to have FromSoftware implement fund procurement by way of a Third-Party Allotment to Sixjoy and SIE.\"\nFromSoftware is the latest studio sell-up its shares, in part or in whole, to Tencent. The holding company already has either full, majority, or partial stock control over a number of major industry players including developers and publishers such as Activision, Supercell, Epic Games, Remedy, Riot Games, PlatinumGames, Bohemia Interactive, Dontnod Entertainment, Klei Entertainment, Inflexion, Sumo Digital, and Funcom.\nThe post Tencent and Sony collectively acquire 30% of FromSoftware appeared first on Destructoid.",

If you're afraid of the ocean, maybe sit this one out.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfniX3fH1l0\nDredge is the debut title from Christchurch-based Black Salt Games and publisher Team17, who has a knack for finding projects with intriguing new concepts in familiar genres.\nThis trailer is more about establishing the serene-meets-sinister vibe of Dredge, which is fine — it serves its purpose. But if you want to see gameplay, I'd check out the Steam page for some more illuminating screenshots and gifs. The lighting is fantastic.\nYer fond of me lobster, ain't ye?\nI like the idea of roaming between islands for quests, snatching up and selling sell fish, earning enough money to upgrade the ship, and heading out into the great unknown, potentially at my own peril. The inventory system also catches my eye as a perpetual Resident Evil 4 replayer; it's going to be fun to twist and turn odd-shaped items (in this case, fish and gear) to squeeze them all into a tight space to maximize trips.\n[caption id=\"attachment_342338\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1920\"] Making room for all the fish on the ship with a bit of \"inventory Tetris.\"[/caption]\nI'm hazy on how the nighttime mechanics work — how screwed are we? — but the scenery is unnerving. (And I'm generally not one to be too put off by freaky Subnautica-sized sea creatures.) As the creators of Dredge put it, you'll be able to \"strengthen your mind and use special abilities to survive trips out on the water after dark.\"\nDredge is launching in 2023 on Nintendo Switch, PC (via Steam), PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S. There's much more to see before then, and I'll be keeping tabs.\nThe post Dredge is a fishing game with a creepy side appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "In a new blog post, Xbox head Phil Spencer discussed Microsoft’s intentions for Activision Blizzard’s IPs following its ongoing acquisition of the company. Among those plans, naturally, is to bolster the value of Xbox Game Pass by adding Activision Blizzard’s library of titles, including Call of Duty, Overwatch, and Diablo.\nSpencer discusses expanding player choice through Game Pass by offering library titles for an affordable subscription fee, appealing to players of various budgets. Spencer hopes that including Activision Blizzard games will make the service more appealing to existing and potential subscribers. \nSpencer also reiterates Microsoft’s promise to keep popular Activision Blizzard franchises multiplatform, citing its handling of Minecraft as an example. Additionally, the company hopes to expand Activision’s portfolio to mobile platforms and make them available to play on other devices via cloud streaming. \nMicrosoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard is projected to be completed sometime during the summer of 2023. After that, it's anyone’s guess as to how long it will be before we see these franchises land on Game Pass. On the Blizzard side, Overwatch 2 launches in free-to-play early access on October 4, and Diablo IV is seemingly years away. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II releases in October, but the series will reportedly skip 2023, meaning the first entry under the Microsoft banner won't be until 2024 at the earliest. \n[Source: Microsoft]",

As misfortune had it, it came out while I was out of town, but my Dad went and picked it up from our local GameStop for me. Like an absolute dork, I remember spending weeks looking at the picture of the box he sent me, practically counting the nanoseconds until I could play it myself. \nAnd when I did, it was everything I could've hoped. I was admittedly a less savvy media viewer back then and truly believed its story was unlike anything else.

A new cinematic trailer shown during Gamescom reveals a November release date, and it runs down the wacky cast of characters and why you'll be riddling them with bullets. \nThe largely CG trailer sprinkles in a bit of in-game action, though you should check out this previous gameplay video for a better taste of the over-the-top combat. We’re introduced to Grave’s allies who band together to take on a fearsome foursome of antagonists looking to rule the world (probably). Fans of the PS2 games and the anime that spawned from them will be happy to know that G.O.R.E. looks as bombastic and absurd as they'd expect. Newcomers that enjoy bullets, blood, and insanity will likely feel right at home. \n\n\nGungrave G.O.R.E. launches November 22 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

As far as why, there’s no official reason as of yet but considering Netflix’s past, it’s likely that Resident Evil didn’t meet expectations in terms of both critical and audience response. The show will now join many other shows canceled after just one season at the streamer including Cowboy Bebop, The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance, and more.\nDeadline notes that Resident Evil’s release came right after the highly anticipated Season 4 of Stranger Things, which might have led to its less-than-stellar first weekend on the service. However, the series still debuted in the number two spot, behind Stranger Things, pulling in 72.7 million watch hours. Deadline reports that viewers watched Resident Evil for 73.3 million hours in its second week, taking the number three spot on Netflix, before dropping out of Netflix’s Top 10 by week three. \nThis isn’t Netflix’s first foray into the world of Resident Evil, though. Its 2021 movie, Resident Evil Infinite Darkness, holds that title, but that anime series wasn’t well-received either. For more about the series, check out this retrospective video that looks back at 25 years of Resident Evil. \n[Source: Deadline]\nDid you watch Resident Evil on Netflix? What did you think of it?

Dubbed Frozen Heath, this update adds new forms, challenges, and a fresh region to explore.\nFrozen Hearth takes place in an underground region that hosts The Tempering, a series of trials consisting of combat challenges and puzzles. Overcoming this contest rewards two new forms: the Killer Bee and the Mechanic, which can be used in the main game. \n\n\nOn September 13 you can buy the Frozen Hearth expansion separately for $4.99 or pick up it alongside the main game in a bundle for $27.99.  \nNobody Saved the World launched in January and became one of our early favorites of 2022. Former editor John Carson scored the game an 8.25 out of 10, writing in his review that, \n“Despite its minor shortcomings, Nobody Saves the World kept me enthralled from start to finish as I leveled my way through form ranks for the next body or ability to work with. It's most fun when unleashing devious yet approachable combat scenarios, keeping me on my toes to find the best solution to survive. Thankfully, it gave me plenty of those unrelenting loops throughout, justifying the time to save this funny little world.”",

Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. \nMetal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. \nWatch on Twitch!\nJoin me, Marcus Stewart, along with Andrew Reiner and Blake Hester, as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure.

Microsoft then declared later that day that it will not be doing the same with the Xbox Series X/S. Now, Nintendo has chimed in on the matter. \nIn a statement to Eurogamer, Nintendo reiterates a quote from president Shuntaro Furukawa, made in June, in which he stated the company has \"no plans to increase the trade price of its hardware.” Furukawa made this statement during the 82nd Annual General Meeting Shareholders that month, in which he also said: \n\"While we cannot comment on pricing strategies, we currently do not have any plans to change the price of our hardware due to inflation or increased procurement costs in each country. We will determine our future pricing strategies through careful and continued deliberations.”\nAlthough the PlayStation 5's price will remain unchanged in the U.S. (for now), both versions of the console have become more expensive in Canada, Europe, the UK, Mexico, Japan, and Australia. The price hikes have already gone into effect in those regions except Japan, which occurs on September 15. \nThe only time Nintendo significantly adjusted the price of its current consoles was last fall, when it permanently reduced the cost of the standard Switch model in the UK and Europe. Nintendo has yet to do the same in the U.S. \n[Source: Eurogamer]",

Over three minutes of gameplay footage shows off the carnage you'll unleash against adversaries, both artificial and organic. \nPlayers wield melee weapons or firearms in one hand and more, shall we say, unconventional abilities in the other. That includes electrifying targets with lightning bolts, tossing them around with a telekinesis-like power, freezing foes solid with an ice blast, or using wires to hijack machines. The action-packed video shows off how players can creatively combine their arsenal to dismantle and disembowel anything standing in their way. \n\n\nAtomic Heart was first announced in 2018 and takes place in an alternative futuristic version of the Soviet Union in 1955. Robotic technology flourished post World War 2, allowing humanity to create a high-tech utopia. Unfortunately, these mechanical helpers have started rebelling against their human creators. If that wasn’t enough, killer mutants born from secret experiments have also run amok. Players control private agent P-3, who embarks on a secret mission to get to the bottom of what’s caused this seemingly perfect society to collapse and clean up this mess. \nAtomic Heart launches this fall for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

An online shared story lets you enjoy the experience with friends from afar, though you can explore the adventure with friends in the room in local multiplayer. \n\n\nThe Dark Pictures Anthology: The Devil In Me arrives November 18 for PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC.

          "description": "If you enjoy over-the-top, stylish action games with plenty of silliness, Wanted: Dead should be on your radar. First announced last fall, the game comes from Soliel Ltd, developer of the upcoming Valkyrie Elysium, and consists of Ninja Gaiden and Dead or Alive alumni. With those credentials, it's little surprise that Wanted: Dead looks absolutely bonkers. \nThe story centers on Hong Kong cop Lt. Hannah Stone, a member of the Zombie Unit. She and her squad must get to the bottom of a corporate conspiracy, but the game doesn’t appear to be nearly as serious as its premise lets on. Gameplay blends stylish swordplay with explosive gunplay as players slice and/or shoot through gang members, mercenaries, and other foes in an adventure that looks ridiculous. The release date trailer also shows off anime cutscenes, rhythm music gameplay, cute cats, and whatever else it manages to cram in. \n\n\nWanted: Dead is launching on February 14 and is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.",

He believes that this is a good thing for the gaming industry in the long run. \n“[It] is something we’re just going to see less and less of,” when discussing the idea of specific games being exclusive to a single device. “Maybe you happen in your household to buy an Xbox, and I buy a PlayStation, and our kids want to play together, and they can’t because we bought the wrong piece of plastic to plug into our television.\n“We really love being able to bring more players in reducing friction, making people feel safe, secure when they’re playing, allowing them to play with their friends, regardless of what device – I think in the long run that is good for this industry. And maybe in the short run, there’s some people in some companies that don’t love it. But I think as we get over the hump and see where this industry can continue to grow, it proves out to be true.”\nBloomberg also asked Spencer about the status of Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard acquisition, how the company will handle unions and ongoing unionization efforts happening within Activision Blizzard, and more, so be sure to check out the publication’s full story here. \n[Source: Bloomberg]\nDo you believe Spencer’s right?

We first learned of the project during the Xbox Games Showcase in June. \nThe game's art direction emulates medieval manuscript illustrations and woodcut prints while the story unfolds in 16th-century Bavaria. You play as an illustrator who becomes wrapped up in a series of murders over 25 years. You'll engage in choice-driven conversations where your decisions steer the plot and create lasting consequences in a tale that expands into a larger conspiracy. Check out the original reveal trailer below to see it in action. \n\n\nPentiment is made by a small team within Obsidian led by director Josh Sawyer. You can pick it up on Xbox consoles and PC (day one on Game Pass). It will be the second game that Obsidian ships this year, following the 1.0 release of Grounded in September.",

So, it’s only fitting that Gamescom 2022 ended with two trailers (cinematic and gameplay) for the long-overdue zombie-slaying sequel. \n\n\nWe follow a chiseled survivor named Jacob as he leaves the safety of his (bloodied) condo and ventures into a Californian hellscape swarming with undead. He kills several adversaries with an empty rifle, jutting it through their rotten bodies and smashing their heads against the pavement with its wooden butt. \nThe gameplay trailer shows scenic beaches, forsaken suburbs, cratered city streets, and still-lit carnivals. In what is one of the most graphic clips I’ve ever seen at a game show, we watch as the player-character clobbers zombies with blunt objects, jump-kicks adversaries off roofs (parkour mechanics?), and shoots gasoline tanks to engulf hordes in flames.\n\n\nDead Island 2 is a first-person action RPG with six playable characters. And according to a designer who appeared onstage, the gory romp has an irreverent, pulpy tone and gameplay that’s all about “experimenting with your preferred zombie-slaying methods.”\nDead Island 2 punches and kicks its way onto PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on February 3.",

Plenty of blood is shed as humans are used as lab rats in Murkoff Corporation's Saw-like tests. In some cases, the tests just look like torture and flatout murder.\nThe game looks overly graphic, yet also brings about comparisons to BioShock's tone and storytelling conventions. It'll be interesting to see how the narrative sews all of these wild experiements together. The Outlast Trials is designed as both a single-player and cooperative experience. The player clearly is free to explore at certain points, and appears to rely on trap-like devices to fight back and escape. In one sequence, we see two players helping each other up to higher ground.\nThe footage concludes with news of a short closed beta running from October 28 to November 1.
