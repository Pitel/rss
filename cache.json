          "description": "\"Everyone can always benefit from another pair of hands\".\nFrom the moment it launched in March 2017, Switch quickly carved itself a niche as the console for couch-co-op gaming. Crack off the Joy-Con and in mere moments you have a a multiplayer setup suitable for wherever you happen to be. Soon, a crowd of zany, co-op party games — many inspired by the success of Overcooked! — hit the eShop, and these days it can be tough to tell one colourful co-op caper from another.\nAt first blush, PlateUp! — the work of indie developer It's happening — looks similar to other pleasant, four-player fare, but taking time to fork through its gameplay and sample its delights reveals a culinary co-op game with a very different flavour. Having launched on Steam in 2022, it's built up over 11,000 'Overwhelmingly Positive' reviews — pretty tasty, we're sure you'd agree.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Another great Octo Expansion.\nA few years ago, a cute new action-adventure game called Eastward released on most platforms, blending some appealing EarthBound-esque visuals with a narrative-driven game loop that’s vaguely reminiscent of the older Zelda games. We really enjoyed it, despite its flaws, and it seems that developer Pixpil had some more ideas it wanted to explore for the unique world it built, as it’s now released a sizable DLC called Eastward: Octopia. This siloed expansion adds a lot more than just a few new levels and scenes, effectively acting as a half-sequel of sorts that completely changes up the gameplay. We’d even go so far as to say that it’s a superior game to the original.\nOctopia’s narrative takes place in an alternate universe separate from the main timeline of Eastward; in this world, things are decidedly cheerier and brighter, while there isn’t a hint of miasma to be found anywhere. The story kicks off with Sam and John arriving by train at a mysterious place called Octopia, an abandoned amusement park that’s long since fallen to ruin. The two purchase a small house and a plot of land there to start afresh, and set out to rebuild Octopia to its former glory through their farming efforts. Plenty of alternate-universe counterpart characters from the main plot of Eastward eventually move there to join them in this endeavor, but everyone is just a little different in this iteration.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

On the one hand, there's arguably a hungry new audience for such games; on the other, you're going up against one of the best RPGs ever made. Expectations are high, but Tiny Trinket Games' co-founder Stefan Nitescu remains unfazed as his three-strong team prepare to release Zoria: Age Of Shattering on March 7th. Zoria is carving an altogether different path through the RPG landscape, fusing isometric exploration with XCOM-like combat and 50 playable characters who are more like unit classes than personalities. The latter is a decision that comes with its own \"repercussions\", says Nitescu, but he's confident that it will help Zoria stand apart, with character abilities being unusually central to exploration. \nRead more",

          "description": "Calling dusty post-apocalyptic city builders a trend is probably a stretch, but not by much. I suppose it's a natural extension of the post-2000s explosion of the survival sim from \"literally about 3 ever made\" to \"does your tetris remake really need the hunger meter\". Games like Against The Storm porting over the roguelike element as well certainly suggest it. In my head, that's probably why New Cycle hangs out more with Endzone Dash A World Apart, and Surviving The Aftermath. It's more a traditional building game than a punishing test to be retaken, or the intense \"survive the ordeal\" narrative of Frostpunk, despite the superficial similarity that your town expects to be ravaged by scorching solar flares.\nBut it might also be because after playing it more than I really wanted to, New Cycle matches those two peers by leaving me with a vague feeling of disappointment. I'm just not sure what it really has to say.\nRead more",

I think that's a thing inherent in me, as I've never taken great pleasure in snapping together pieces of Lego, and would much rather earn killstreaks than decorate a back garden. For me, building in most games is laborious and predictable and does not sate my impatient brain.\nBut I like Neal Agarwal's Infinite Craft, a browser game where you slide words on top of each other and see if they generate something new. For instance, \"water\" and \"fire\" combine to make \"steam\", with what's practically infinitesimal possibilities. It is immediate, simple, and unpredictable.

Alas, we'll just have to make do with the altogether more pedestrian date of a regular Thursday in February, as the team need just a bit of extra time to ensure it's \"as polished as possible\" before release. \nRead more",

I just think they're neat.

Cute miniature puzzle game Lumino City is ten years old, and Trüberbrook is coming up on five. And I first played a tiny snippet of Harold Halibut in 2018. Now, a larger snippet is available for everyone in the Steam Next Fest.\nHarold Halibut is a sort of sci-fi, slightly retrofuturist point and click puzzle game about an undersea society on an alien planet. These people's ancestors blasted off to an ocean planet using the technology of a big science corporation and now, though they can't remember why, they're all pootling about under the water looking at fish. In this world of exaggerated sea-science nonsense, Harold stands out as a sort of beige lab handyman.\nRead more",

Since its surprise launch in February 2019, developers Respawn Entertainment have chopped and changed everything from hitbox-shrinking Naruto run animations to entire character designs and ability kits, gutting and reworking gear and class mechanics along the way. The incoming Season 20 update, titled Breakout, represents the latest large-scale rejig, adding upgradeable skill tress for its playable Legends that promise MOBA-esque progression and the maddest fights yet.\nThen again, if you actually ask Respawn’s Apex team how they reached this point – as I did when I visited their Los Angeles offices for a Season 20 test run – you’re unlikely to get just one answer. Rather, the battle royale’s unusual longevity in a fiercely contested space is more often attributed to those ongoing work-and-rework efforts themselves, the scope of which sometimes remains a surprise to the developers themselves. As does, according to lead game designer Devan McGuire, Apex’s success.\nRead more",

This isn't confirmation that a third single player Last Of Us game is in development, with Druckmann reiterating comments from this time last year that Naughty Dog feel no obligation to continue the tale. Nonetheless, \"it does feel like there's probably one more chapter to this story.\" Will we ever really see the last of The Last Of Us?\nRead more",

I was thrilled to see the 5700X3D debut at £233 at Amazon - before stocks were exhausted and it went back up to £240, anyway. \nNow though, the faster 5800X3D has dropped to nearly the same price, just £234 - an even better deal given its higher clock speeds and (very marginally) faster performance. If you're still running an older Ryzen processor and your motherboard can be updated to support the 5800X3D, then I highly recommend this processor, especially if you're using a comparatively low-res 1080p or 1440p display as you're more likely to be CPU-limited at these resolutions!  \nRead more",

Nowadays it means pretty, lovable or charming, albeit perhaps with an undertone of mistrust or contempt, as in the phrase \"that's a cute observation, Edwin\". But the word originally evolved from \"acute\", which very broadly means sharp or intense. \"Acute\" was once a Middle English word for a short-lived fever - it's related to \"ague\", a word you've likely come across in a medieval fantasy RPG somewhere, which refers to fits of sweating and shivering. The word \"cute\", then, is secretly diseased, and so, perhaps, is the experience of cuteness. There's a psychological phenomenon called \"cute aggression\" which refers to the desire to physically envelop, dominate and even abuse the thing you find cute - \"I just want to squeeze you till you pop\".\n Read more",

I think Psychonauts 2 was the last one that really took my breath away, but outside of that (as well as obviously every 3D Nintendo platformer), I often struggle to think of many games that could be considered its equal. There's always something holding them back, isn't there? Whether it's a wonky camera, slightly unwieldly controls, or the platforming itself is just a little too pedestrian to ignite the imagination.\nSo where does Penny's Big Breakaway fit into the equation? This is the next game from former Sonia Mania dev Christian Whitehead's new studio, Evening Star, and yep, you can definitely tell this was made by some real Sonic heads. Penny and her (strangely toothy) sentient yo-yo, err, Yo-Yo, feel like a ball of energy just waiting to bust out across the colourful scenery of their home world of Macaroon, and golly, they sure can fly with just a couple of timely button presses. Alas, there is a but. For me at least, Penny and Yo-Yo are perhaps a bit too energetic for my platforming tastes, and having spent a few hours with an early preview build, I often found them quite a rambunctious pairing to keep under control.\nRead more",

          "description": "Take-Two Interactive has an interesting response to gamers upset with what the company does with the in-game currency they buy. In an ongoing dispute over whether money is essentially stolen when a game's servers shut down, Take-Two characterized in-game virtual currency as \"fictions created by game publishers.\"\n\n\nCurrently Take-Two is facing a class-action lawsuit in California related to microtransactions in the NBA 2K games. Particularly, the lawsuit takes issue with the fact that when Take-Two takes down servers for old games, players lose access to the virtual currency (VC) that they bought.\n\n\nAccording to Axios, the suit alleges that: “By removing Plaintiff and the Class members' VC, Defendants took and stole their personal property, or fraudulently appropriated property that had been entrusted to Defendant.”\n\n\nIn response to the lawsuit, Take-Two’s lawyers are targeting the claim that virtual currency is property. Game File reports that the company’s attorneys filed a request to dismiss the lawsuit last week. The argument goes that  gamers might have paid to obtain the currency, but it’s not something they can actually own. \n\n\nIn the filing, Take-Two’s attorneys write: “VC is not plaintiff’s property. Instead, in-game VC are fictions created by game publishers, subject to the publishers’ terms of service and user agreements.” \n\n\nThat said, lawsuits targeting microtransactions of all kinds seem to be popping up more frequently. In May 2023, Nintendo faced a class-action suit over the loot boxes in Mario Kart Tour. And NBA 2K has run afoul of microtransaction issues before, with Belgian and Dutch gambling laws in 2018.\n\nThe post Take-Two calls virtual currency ‘fictions created by game publishers’ amid microtransaction lawsuit appeared first on Destructoid.",

In fact, the potential word of mouth may have even helped.\n\n\nReception seems to be positive, too. On Steam, the current review score is Overwhelmingly Positive with a 97% rating. Additionally, it has an 88 Metacritic score from 61 critics as of the time of writing.\n\n\nPersona 3 Reload is an updated version of the original PS2 game, for better or for worse. It has an all-new UI, a talented voice cast, updated graphics similar to Persona 5, and both remade tracks and new music. It also lets you control all of your party members during battle rather than the AI taking measures into its own hands.

Before her adoption, somewhere along the line, the cat learned to be cautious around humans — honestly, not a bad stance to take. \n\n\nThe woman has experienced her fair share of loss as well, and you learn this as you take control of Dawn and do all the usual daily cat duties, like …",

Today, we get our first taste of what to expect when the show drops on April 26.\n\n\nIf you enjoyed Sonic the Hedgehog and Sonic the Hedgehog 2, it looks like we're in store for more of the same. Just with more Knuckles, still played by Idris Elba, which is great! This first Knuckles trailer is meaty with a duration of about two-and-a-half minutes. It sets the tone for the Paramount Plus series as we see some of the Echidna's purpose, villains, and more. \n\n\n\n\nJust the other day we saw our first Sonic the Hedgehog 3 teaser drop, which also confirmed the return of Jim Carrey's Dr. Robotnik. In this first Knuckles trailer, we see a new villain that seems like a solid foil for to the great Echidna Warrior. \n\n\nThis unnamed villain is played by Rory McCann. The actor is perhaps best known for portraying the massive fan-favorite Sandor Clegane, also known as The Hound, in HBO's Game of Thrones.\n\n\nMcCann's character and his underlings have access to Knuckles' powers in the streaming series. This seemingly sets up equally powered battles between the opposing factions. \n\n\nWhat has Knuckles been up to?\n\n\nAs for Knuckles' motivations, he appears to have hit a bit of a slump following the Sonic 2 movie. This series takes place directly after the sequel but before the upcoming Sonic the Hedgehog 3. Knuckles finally finds purpose in training a new warrior though. That student? Tom Wachowski's Deputy of Green Hills, Wade Whipple.\n\n\nThere's likely to be plenty of buddy cop-esque comedy between Knuckles and Wade throughout the six-episode limited series. The short episode count may have been a great decision for the show because it looks fantastic quality-wise. We'll see how this new chapter of the Sonic cinematic universe turns out when Knuckles begins streaming via Paramount Plus on April 26.\n\nThe post First Knuckles trailer looks awesome, and drops the series release date appeared first on Destructoid.",

Now, with the full thing having recently launched, the creator of the project is looking to make their own game.\n\n\nIn a recent interview with DualShockers, developer Gavin Clayton said he's now working on his own idea, which will be styled after Daggerfall. He has this to say about the project:\n\n\n\nI do genuinely love that old style of game. The thing I’m building is in the same vein. You’re talking big world, complex systems, mod support, that’s all of the stuff I want to explore, and I want to take that experience of Daggerfall Unity and put it in the new game.\n\n\n\n\nEssentially, Clayton wants to realize his dream of making a game from scratch, something he's dreamed of since he was a kid.\n\n\nWith some D&D influence in there, perhaps\n\n\nWhile there are no details about what this game will actually be, he's been open to answering a few questions on Twitter/X.\n\n\nFor example, when asked whether he was going to be using Unity, Clayton said he's building his own engine, or, more accurately, he's \"revived an engine I spent some years on.\"\n\n\nAs for any kind of lore or narrative, the project is still in the early stages, but when asked, the response was that the \"world and main story have their roots in a D&D 2ED campaign I created and ran for friends in the 90s.\"\n\n\nDaggerfall Unity has been an enormous task for anyone to complete, especially as it was a full remake using a different engine. It's almost certainly reinvigorated interest in Bethesda's classic RPG, and I would personally recommend anyone interested in retro Elder Scrolls games to check it out.\n\nThe post Daggerfall Unity creator is making their own retro Elder Scrolls-esque game appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "For a game that was built in collaboration with AMD, it seems surprising that it's taken this long for Starfield to support FidelityFX Super Resolution 3. However, the most recent update now makes it compatible with the image upscaling algorithm. But of course, there's a slight catch.\n\n\nThe recent patch notes, as well as a message on Twitter/X, show that Bethesda has finally enabled the option for FSR 3. The slight downside to this is that it's only released in Steam Beta, but at least it's started rolling out now, I guess.\n\n\n\n\nAs for what else version 1.9.67 of Starfield includes, we're being told that Intel's own Xe Super Sampling – a rival to FSR and Nvidia's DLSS – is also supported now. There have also been a few other fixes, but apart from the aforementioned AMD and Intel tech, this seems like a relatively small update.\n\n\nThe future of Starfield...\n\n\nWe all know the story now, but it's worth repeating. For what was the most hyped-up game of this generation, many of us were left largely shrugging our shoulders after a few hours of playing.\n\n\nAt the time of writing, SteamDB shows that 5,310 people are currently playing Starfield on PC. That's not enough for a Bethesda game that – as the studio continued to remind us – was almost 25 years in the making.\n\n\nWe've been promised some major updates to the game in the future, which may or may not represent turning points. The reality of the situation, however, is that while some people will be happy FSR 3 is now an option, it's going to take more than that to get people interested in the game again.\n\nThe post Starfield, for those still playing, finally supports AMD FSR 3 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Recently, we brought news that Embracer Group was laying off staff at Eidos Montreal. This brought to the fore the uncertainty of the Deus Ex franchise, and now some words of thanks have come from the voice of Adam Jensen himself.\n\n\nIn a recent post on the Mankind Divided subreddit, Elias Toufexis wanted to express his appreciation for the support over the years. With this, the actor has essentially said goodbye to Jensen, adding that \"his story seems done.\"\n\n\n\n\nWith the future of Deus Ex uncertain, Toufexis has said that the recent layoffs and the alleged cancellation of a potential new game have \"angered\" him. However, he does – jokingly, it seems – suggest that someone like Elon Musk (\"I think he has some money\") could possibly take over the franchise and keep it going.\n\n\nWho better to take the reins on dystopian sci-fi..?\n\n\nWe will likely never know what would have become of Adam Jensen. Toufexis seems certain that, had the studio been working on a new story based around the character, he would have been contacted.\n\n\nHis message is also the culmination of ongoing dismay within the gaming industry, as huge companies make cutbacks, with some studios shutting down entirely. Eidos Montreal is sadly one of the more recent examples of this swathe of job losses.\n\n\nBut it seems Toufexis wants to try and put a more positive spin on things, hoping fans will continue to like his non-Jensen work. Whether we will ever see a new Deus Ex game again remains to be seen, but with Mankind Divided coming up on the eight-year anniversary of its release, a lot of us are more than hungry for a return to this universe.\n\nThe post Deus Ex’s Adam Jensen gives heartfelt thanks to fans amidst Eidos layoffs appeared first on Destructoid.",

The hype has resulted in a tsunami of purchases, putting Helldivers 2 in a good position. \n\n\nOn Steam, it reached the top of the charts and then floated around the second or third place on Thursday morning just before launch. This indicates the game has found some popularity, and people are curious about what Arrowhead has been cooking up. \n\n\nUnlike its predecessor, it is not a top-down one. We got our first glimpse of it during the State of Play in 2023. It appeared to compete with franchises like Counterstrike and Helldivers 2. \n\n\nIf you're new to the series (like myself), there is a trailer that explains the story so far. There is also free content in the pipes to keep the online element consistently alluring.\n\n\n\n\nOne of the best parts of Helldivers 2 is that it has cross-platform functionality, meaning that if you purchase the game on Steam, you can still play it on PS5 for free. It's also possible for friends on PC and PS5 to play together. \n\n\nDestructoid will cover Helldivers 2 to ascertain whether it is the online third-person shooter Sony desperately needs or a sign that the genre has outgrown itself. \n\nThe post Helldivers 2 soars to the top of Steam’s charts on launch day appeared first on Destructoid.",

According to the post, recent feedback from Homeworld 3's public War Games demo and insights from Homeworld veterans made the team aware of final tweaks to make Homeworld 3 the best experience possible.\n\n\n\n\nImportant to get it right\n\n\nHomeworld 3 has seen a handful of delays in the last year. Originally scheduled for the first half of 2023, the RTS was first delayed to February 2024. At the end of last month, it suffered a roughly one-month delay to March, and then now another two month delay to May. Delays are always a bummer. \n\n\nBut, it's more important than ever to ensure quality. You can only launch once, and in the case of Homeworld 3, there's a pretty devoted fanbase of players who still love to play Homeworld and Homeworld 2. Assuming Blackbird and Gearbox intend for players to delve into Homeworld 3 for as long, it's important they get it right.\n\n\n\n\n\nAddition of War Games\n\n\nThere's actually a Homeworld 3 demo available right now on Steam Next Fest. The demo features a new Homeworld mode, called War Games. Commanders manage a fleet through numerous waves of enemies to claim powerful artifacts and augment their ships to complete objectives. It's essentially a roguelike mode for the space RTS which is a pretty innovative approach.\n\n\nI was able to play about an hour of the demo and thought the mode itself was a pretty fun addition to the genre. However, the UI and camera controls felt a bit rough around the edges. Hopefully, these extra two months will give Blackbird the time to add some extra love and polish ahead of release.\n\n\nHomeworld 3 will now be released on May 13 on PC. Those who purchase the Fleet Command or Collector's Edition will get access three days early on May 10.\n\n\n\nThe post Homeworld 3 has been delayed out to May appeared first on Destructoid.",

He is shown briefly in a recent trailer published Tuesday. \n\n\n\n\nMuhammad Ali will be joining a roster of over 200 WWE Superstars when the sports entertainment game releases next month. With him being a boxer, his moveset will likely revolve around punches as shown in the trailer. \n\n\nAli has appeared on WWE programming twice. First and most notably, the boxer was a guest referee during the first Wrestlemania 40 years ago. It was during the main event with Hulk Hogan and Mr. T (from The A-Team fame) against \"Rowdy\" Roddy Piper and Paul Orndorff. Despite his place of authority, he did lay in a punch or two against Piper and fought off one of his allies trying to insert themselves into the match. \n\n\nAnother reason why Muhammad Ali might be in WWE 2K24, despite being arguably the best boxer of all time, is that he actually fought a wrestler in the ring before. He interrupted a match with Gorilla Monsoon and matched his fists against Monsoon's grappling prowess.\n\n\n\n\nThis year's WWE game will be looking back at 40 years of Wrestlemania, so it makes sense that Ali is included. If you're going all the way back to the original Wrestlemania, you'd probably want to include such a notable appearance.\n\n\nOther confirmed wrestlers in WWE 2K24 include Cody Rhodes, Andre The Giant, Chyna, Hulk Hogan, and Kevin Nash, among many others. Due to recent events, Brock Lesnar may or may not make it into the final roster, especially after his removal from the mobile title Supercard. \n\nThe post Legendary boxer Muhammad Ali joins WWE 2K24 roster appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Insomniac Games intended to deliver Marvel's Spider-Man 2 New Game+ mode before the end of 2023. Unfortunately, the development team couldn't meet the original deadline, but now it's set to launch a NG+ for Peter and Miles next month.\n\n\nWith 2024 in full swing, Insomniac is eyeing a new timeframe to release New Game+ for Spider-Man 2. The team announced today that the highly requested feature, plus a few other additions, will be coming to the quite-popular Sony sequel in March. \n\n\n\n\nInsomniac confirms New Game+, fresh suits, and other additional content will be part of the update on March 7. The Spider-Man 2 developer also teased that \"highly requested features\" are being added at the same time as New Game+, but we won't hear about those until closer to the update's release. \n\n\nAny fans hoping for story DLC to drop soon should probably continue to hold tight. The initial Spider-Man on PlayStation 4 saw the first wave of its City that Never Sleeps content come out a little over a month following the debut of the base game. Spider-Man 2 was released on October 20, and there is no confirmation either way from Insomniac whether additional story content is coming.\n\n\nThe unfortunate Insomniac hack late last year may have indicated there's more in the works. However, internal plans and development cycles frequently change, so nothing is certain until it's officially official. \n\n\nThere are certainly lingering storylines that fans would be excited to see utilized for potential Spider-Man 2 DLC (where the Crimson Hour story goes next, for one). Time will tell if we get just that, or whether we'll have to wait for what's next for the franchise further down the line. \n\nThe post Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 gets New Game+ in March appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Artisan Studios, the developer behind Astria Ascending, has announced their next project. Lost Hellden is an action JRPG that is coming in 2025.\n\n\nAlongside the announcement is a trailer that demonstrates the art style they’re using, which is confusingly called “Deep 2D.” They explain it: \"You play in 3D in hand-painted artworks with dynamic lighting and weather.” To me, it looks like 3D polygonal models with hand-painted textures over hybrid 2D pre-rendered backgrounds. Maybe they’re referring to the way the lighting and real-time weather give the 2D backgrounds some tangible depth. That sort of sounds like how it was done in the 2002 remake of Resident Evil. \n\n\nTrailer via Gematsu\n\n\nAnyway, I’m getting off track. It looks pretty convincing. It reminds me of a more high-fidelity PS1-era JRPG, and I mean that as a compliment.\n\n\nThe gameplay looks like instanced battles that mix “action and strategy.” It features eight characters that you can customize to your play style.\n\n\nThe team working on it features Hitoshi Sakimoto on audio and music, best known for compositions on Final Fantasy XII, Tactics Ogre, and Valkyria Chronicles. The illustrator is Takeshi Oga, who worked on the Gravity Rush and Siren series. That’s some good pedigree.\n\n\nLost Hellden is planned for 2025 on PC and consoles.\n\nThe post The Astria Ascending devs are back with another visually striking RPG appeared first on Destructoid.",

Additionally, Fortune's Keep, a Resurgence map from previous versions of Warzone, has returned.

Announced at the State of Play today, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is getting a demo, and it's out today on the PlayStation Store. \n\n\n\n\nThe demo will get you access to the first chapter of Rebirth, with a party of Cloud and Sephiroth in the game's opening. Sometime between today and the release of Rebirth, the demo will also be updated to extend to Cloud, Aerith, Tifa, Barrett, and Red XIII in Junon. There was no mention of whether save progress would carry over or not.\n\n\nPizza in the Sky\n\n\nFinal Fantasy games have been consistently getting demos lately. Last year, we got the fantastic Final Fantasy XVI demo and, before that, Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origins. In fact, in 2020, Square Enix released a demo for Final Fantasy 7 Remake which covered the first chapter. \n\n\nNews of this new Rebirth demo leaked a little ahead of schedule last night, via the Explore page. \n\n\nAs a fan of Final Fantasy 7 Remake, I’ve been hyped about Rebirth for a while. Plus, I just finished Crisis Core Reunion, so I’m up-to-date on whatever craziness Tetsuya Nomura and the team have in store. I’m way too curious as to why a certain black-haired SOLDIER is still alive and squatting.\n\n\nThe demo should be available today on the PlayStation store for players to plunge their swords into, and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth releases on February 28 on PlayStation 5. \n\nThe post Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth has a demo available today appeared first on Destructoid.",

Speaking of which, Persona 3 Reload has shot to the head of Atlus's ranking of fastest-selling games, shipping over a million copies worldwide in its first week.\nPersona 3 Reload sold 1,000,000 copies worldwide within its first week, becoming the fastest selling game in ATLUS history! 🎉\npic.twitter.com/C2abDAwCDs\nFebruary 8, 2024\nOriginally released on the PlayStation 2, Persona 3 was the first game in its series to define its modern formula, combining social responsibilities with dungeon crawling and a lengthy, emotional story. It's been re-released multiple times and was even ported to modern consoles last year, but even the upgraded versions don't hold a candle to the mind-bending masterpiece that is Persona 5 Royal. Persona 3 Reload closes that gap, however, introducing overhauled visuals and mechanics to bring the game that started it all up to the level of quality fans of the series have come to expect. If the sales numbers and our glowing review are any indication, the upgrade has been well worth the wait.\nTo put these numbers in context, here are some other games that have recently reached comparable significant milestones: Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth shipped 1 million copies as of Feb 1, Nintendo's quarterly report revealed Tears of the Kingdom has sold 20 million copies, and viral hit Palworld continues to smash record after record.\nHave you checked out Persona 3 Reload yet?

That event officially has a date, and it's April 2.\nFor Funimation subscribers, you will have to go through the process of merging your account before the April 2 date, and, frustratingly, any shows that were outright purchased through Funimation will not transfer to Crunchyroll. Just another reminder that when you purchase digital content, true ownership does not technically exist and you will always be at the mercy of the platform holders when it comes to access.\nCrunchyroll subscribers do not need to make any changes, but the price of the subscription will rise to $100 a year soon. The merger officially going through does mean Crunchyroll will feature more content, but a price increase will always be frustrating.\nAlongside this merger finally completing, Crunchyroll is also entering the video game space as a publisher. It remains to be seen what kind of video tames the anime company will help produce, but you can check out this package it sent over on Game Informer's TikTok account.\nAs a subscriber to both services who somehow has managed to continue to have a need for both (Outlaw Star is curiously currently only available on Funimation) the merger is bittersweet.

          "description": "Project Orion is still a deeply mysterious game. We know it is a follow-up to Cyberpunk 2077, we know CD Projekt Red is developing the game in North America (Boston, specifically) as opposed to Poland where the main studio is based, and eventually development will expand to Vancouver, with support from the main Polish headquarters. Beyond those details, we don't know much. Implications from CD Projekt point to it being a sequel, but it could be a spin-off, or something entirely different. Of note, Project Orion was a study from the 50s and 60s about the viability of nuclear power for space travel. Maybe that's what CD Projekt's Cyberpunk 2077 follow-up will be about.\nWe may not know much about the game, but based on a press release from CD Projekt this morning, we now know some of the folks who will be working on it. Dan Hernberg is now a Project Orion executive producer who was head of production at Amazon Games, and also has history at Panic Button and Blizzard Entertainment.  Ryan Barnard was a game director at Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft, but perhaps most notably, was the gameplay director at Hitman for developer IO Interactive. Barnard is joining Project Orion as a design director. Alan Villani is now an engineering director on Project Orion and worked on several Mortal Kombat titles. Anna Megill is a Project Orion lead writer with history on titles like Control, Dishonored: Death of The Outsider, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, Guild Wars 2, and the upcoming Fable from Playground Games. Alexander Freed is an additional writer on Project Orion and is a New York Times bestselling novelist and comic book writer who previously worked at Bioware on Star Wars: The Old Republic and more.\nWe're eager to learn more about Project Orion, but suspect it will be some time before we do.

          "description": "Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is one of the biggest Xbox exclusives on the horizon. According to a new report, however, Microsoft might be thinking of bringing Indy to other platforms.\nThe Verge has spoken to an insider familiar with Microsoft’s plans who claims the publisher is considering the idea of bringing several first-party titles to other consoles, like releasing Indiana Jones on the PlayStation 5. The source claims that Bethesda is tentatively targeting a December release for the title and that it will launch as an Xbox/PC title before possibly coming to PlayStation 5 after a short exclusivity window. \n\n\nRemember that nothing has been officially announced or confirmed, so take this report with a grain of salt. It’s worth noting, though, that during Microsoft’s trial with the FTC over its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Bethesda’s then head of publishing, Pete Hines, testified that parent company ZeniMax had initially signed an agreement with Disney to make Indiana Jones a multiplatform game. Microsoft later amended this deal to make the game an Xbox exclusive after it acquired ZeniMax in 2020, with Hines explaining the decision was made in the name of \"reducing risk and trying to get a degree of clarity.\"\nMicrosoft’s rumored multi-platform approach has garnered plenty of speculation in recent months. The publisher is reportedly looking to bring first-party games like Hi-Fi Rush and Sea of Thieves to rival platforms in the near future. Starfield is also rumored for a PS5 launch, as reported by XboxEra. \nIndiana Jones and the Great Circle was first announced in 2021 and had its full reveal during the Xbox Developer Direct last month. The first-person action-adventure romp stars Troy Baker as Indy in a story set between Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade. The game is slated to launch sometime this year for Xbox Series X/S and PC. \n[Source: The Verge]",

          "description": "Death Stranding 2: On The Beach’s latest trailer is aggressively bizarre. In 9 minutes and 40 seconds, the video assaults us with talking stop-motion puppets, sentient gloves wrapped around people’s necks, throat babies vomiting out spaceships, a samurai that sounds like an infant, and somehow, Higgs returned. \nIt’s so densely packed with weird stuff that, upon repeat viewings, I actually had to go out of my way to pinpoint anything remotely mundane. In a humorous turn of events, Death Stranding 2 is so overwhelmingly odd that every eye-brow-raising visual element is par for the course. Anything that isn’t a black oil-covered tube baby with a hilariously literal moniker voiced by Troy Baker is now the minority and, in turn, the “weird” stuff. They’re not easy to spot, so I took the liberty…",

Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days.

But it’s not because the game is terrible. It’s because even after five hours, I still have no idea how I feel about it.\nThere is a scene in The Dark Knight Rises that I always assumed would become a meme, but never did. When Anne Hathaway’s Selina Kyle gets stopped trying to escape at the airport by Joseph Gordon-Levitt’s John Blake, he asks her about Bruce Wayne’s fate. In a fantastic one-line performance, she looks into his eyes with genuine uncertainty and fear and says simply, “I’m not sure.” And that’s exactly how I feel when someone asks me what I think of Rocksteady’s Suicide Squad.\n\nI am not a fan of the genre Suicid…",

If you're unfamiliar with what this festive celebration of games is, every year, Steam holds its Next Fest to highlight (mostly) indie games coming out this year and beyond with fun, often bite-sized demos. And the best part is the demos are completely free! \nGame Informer got access to some of these demos before their launch when Steam Next Fest begins on Monday, February 5, and enjoyed quite a few. That's why in today's installment of New Gameplay Today, hosts Wesely LeBlanc and Kyle Hilliard want to showcase three games: Pepper Grinder, a fun momentum-based platformer, Kamaeru: A Frog Refuge, a cozy frog farming sim, and Dystopika, a chill cyberpunk city builder. \nCheck out gameplay of all three of these demos in the NGT below: \n\n\nAll three of these games are set to launch sometime later this year, but if you're interested, you can try each out (and dozens more) as part of Steam Next Fest, which begins Monday, February 5, and ends Monday, February 12. \nHead over to Game Informer's YouTube channel for more previews, reviews, and discussions of new and upcoming games.

Early looks made it seem like a pleasant environmental puzzle game about a pair of brothers going on an adventure, but actually playing the game showcased an impressive and specific point of view from its creator, Josef Fares. You can read Game Informer's review of the original Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons by following the link. The game was both heartwarming and heartbreaking, and to this day still features some of the best examples of gameplay as storytelling, and it's all done without any proper dialogue. After Brothers' release, Fares went on to found Hazelight, the studio behind A Way Out and It Takes Two.\nNow, 10 years later, developer Avantgarden Games is preparing to release a remake of the game on February 28 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Join Marcus Stewart and me as we take a look at the new version and reminisce about the original.\nAnd for more on Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, read our in-depth Afterwords on the game with Josef Fares from 2013 here.\n\n\nHead over to Game Informer's YouTube channel for more previews, reviews, and discussions of new and upcoming games.

          "description": "Today's announcement of Sonic x Shadow Generations brought all kinds of love for Sonic's dark doppelganger as longtime fans celebrate Shadow's return after being absent from recent projects like Sonic Superstars and Sonic Frontiers. However, players won't need to wait for the fall launch of Sonic x Shadow Generations to enjoy speeding around as Shadow, as Sega also announced it is celebrating today's announcement by releasing a free equippable DLC costume to Sonic Superstars on February 15.\nSonic Superstars already includes several other skins you can equip onto your characters, ranging from Lego costumes to a Santa costume for Sonic to even the original prototype rabbit design. No screenshots or photos have been released for the newly announced Shadow costume in Sonic Superstars.\nIn July 2023, I asked Sonic Team creative officer Takashi Iizuka why Shadow isn't in Sonic Superstars. \"Shadow is from the Modern series of characters and gameplay that we have introduced,\" Iizuka says. \"The Classic series exists before the Modern series, so they haven't met at that time. There's no relationship, so we won't be bringing Shadow into the Classic series. Unfortunately, Shadow was in a capsule at that time.\"\nBy adding Shadow as an equippable skin, Iizuka and the rest of Sonic Team are able to circumvent the lore reasoning for leaving Shadow on the sidelines for Superstars. This year is shaping up to be the Year of Shadow for the Sonic brand. Shadow is coming to Sonic Superstars as an equippable skin, he's co-headlining the aforementioned Sonic Generations remaster in the fall, and he figures to be one of the main attractions in the upcoming Sonic the Hedgehog 3 film when that hits theaters in December.\nSonic Superstars launched on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on October 17, 2023. The free Shadow costume arrives in Sonic Superstars as free DLC on February 15. For more on that game, check out our review here. You can also visit our exclusive coverage hub by heading here.",

The news was announced during today’s State of Play.\nThe game, which first entered Steam Early Access in May 2022, puts players in the immortal shoes of a weak vampire who awakens after slumbering for centuries. Players must regain their strength and rebuild their castle, which, among other things, involves enslaving humans to do their bidding. Whatever your method of rebuilding your might and fending off foes, you’ll have to plan around a day/night cycle since sunlight is a big no-no for your well being. V Rising can be played alone or alongside friends in multiplayer. \n\n\nInterestingly, since Sony doesn't have an Early Access style program, one has to wonder if V Rising’s arrival will coincide with an impending 1.0 launch on PC. V Rising was a big hit when it first arrived on Steam and has garnered positive reviews, so here's hoping the experience translates well on console.",

Not only that, but it is, as Kojima put it, an \"action espionage\" game.\nIf that genre sounds vaguely familiar in relation to Kojima, that might be because the tagline of his global breakthrough, Metal Gear Solid, released in 1998, used the tagline \"Tactical Espionage Action.\" In normal people's terms, that means a stealth game. \n\n\nKojima's return to the stealth genre, one he pioneered decades ago with the Metal Gear series, is still quite a ways off. As he tells it, development will begin in earnest after Death Stranding 2 is released sometime in 2025. \nHe then went on to say a bunch of stuff that didn't make a ton of sense, though maybe one day it will in retrospect. This new game will also apparently be a movie \"in terms of look, story, theme, cast, acting, fashion, and sound,\" Kojima said, before adding that with this new game, Kojima Productions hopes to \"transcend the barriers between film and video games.\"",

The game has a whimsical, lighthearted vibe and consistently entertaining gameplay, which together has garnered a lot of praise.\n\n\nAlongside the release on PlayStation consoles, we also got a tease of a new crossover coming to Dave the Diver, in which Godzilla shows up in the strange waters of the Blue Hole.

The trailer opens with Fragile and a friend, or someone very reminiscent of Fragile, performing surgery while a pair of additional hands cover her mouth. Later in the trailer she says, \"These days I am Fragile in name only,\" before explaining her efforts to create Drawbridge, which apparently was started when Sam went off on his own after the events of the first game.\n\n\nThe trailer also showcases the return of villain Higgs, who was teased in the first trailer. He wears a mask but removes it to reveal a face that looks like it belongs in The Crow. He tells Sam that it looks like he traded in rope for a stick this go 'round, recalling a major element of the original game which discussed how early humanity was faced with two tools in the beginning – one to create connection, and one to create conflict. Also, Higgs attacks enemies with a guitar.\n\nOther interesting elements of the trailer include discussions about the black goo from the universe of Death Stranding being a sort of primordial soup, the disappearance of Lou (the baby Sam carried with him in the first game), and a talking puppet that Sam carries on his hip. We also got a peak at Elle Fanning's character sneaking around and listening in on a surgery, but we know nothing else about her so far.\nThe trailer ended with the phrase, \"Should we have connected?\" and promised a 2025 release window, so we still have some time to wait. It also gave the PlayStation 5 exclusive game a proper subtitle: On The Beach.",

And please take some screenshots along the way.\nNow, luck be with you. And remember, with the aliens cheating on the tests they set up for you, this will be no easy task.\n>",

          "description": "OpenTTD turns 20 this year, and to celebrate we are preparing for one of our largest ever releases. It’s packed with 40 new features, 80 changes, and almost 150 fixes. In the upcoming weeks we will share more posts explaining some of these features in depth. For now, we need your help testing our work. We need as many people as possible to test this beta version of the 14.X release series, so you can find and we can squash as many bugs as possible before the actual release. To guide you a bit towards what you should be looking for: Generic gameplay bugs and crashes. There is a new Ship Pathfinder; test it out. Buoys are optional to use. You can now automatically unbunch your vehicles at a depot. We added our own interpretation of daylength to the game. More on this soon in another blog post. There are many GUI improvements throughout the game. More consistent look, better GUI scaling. There are many more things worth talking about, and this will be made more clear when we approach the release of 14.0. But for now, play the game, and please report any issues you find. The usual titlegame competition has also been announced on the forums. See the page for the exact competition rules if you are interested. Download Changelog Bug tracker",

Powered by Firebase, it's the fastest and easiest way to test your app against real devices, including the Google Pixel 8 Pro, Pixel Fold, select Samsung devices, and more.\n\nAfter connecting to a device, you can deploy your app, view the display, interact with the device (including rotating or unfolding the device), and anything else you might do with a device over a direct ADB over SSL connection—all without leaving Android Studio. When you're done using the device, Google wipes all your data and factory resets the device before making it available to another developer.\nDuring Open Alpha, you can use Device Streaming at no cost. To get started simply sign into your Developer account from Android Studio and select a Firebase project. If you don't already have a Firebase project, it's easy to create one.
