          "description": "\"I promise you, it was not a decision made lightly\".\nWe are still a little way off the release of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door on Switch on 23rd May, but thanks to last week's hands-on previews, we now have confirmation of the game's frame rate. Nintendo's latest remake will run at 30FPS (down from 60FPS on the GameCube original), but this is not a decision that the developers will have made lightly, suggests Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon director, Abebe Tinari (thanks, My Nintendo News).\nThe director recently took to Twitter to state that they \"can empathise\" with the Paper Mario devs, drawing from their personal experience on Bayonetta Origins to explain why the game might not run at the higher frame rate that many were expecting.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Well, lucky for you, we've got one right here.

As previously rumoured, the system's screen will indeed be larger and support 1080p resolution (the current Switch consoles max out at 720p), while the new larger Joy-Con controllers will adopt an 'electromagnetic suction docking structure' controlled by electric current.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

But you know what? Yeah, we can see it. Now, we're not going to sit here and say that it's going to be a genre-defining platforming and stand toe-to-toe with some of Nintendo's best, but it definitely looks like it's heavily inspired by the likes of Super Mario 3D Land and Super Mario 3D World.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

On the surface, Final Fantasy II is pretty similar to its predecessor, with one big exception — levelling. Instead of gaining experience points, your party improves depending on the actions they take. So attack will increase the more you attack, and depending on what weapon your character is attacking with, their proficiency with that weapon will improve.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Truly goated.\nThough the peak years of the 3D platformer genre were in the late '90s and early 2000s, there’s been a bit of a resurgence in interesting new genre entries in recent years. Titles such as Glyph and Lunistice have shown that smaller platforming projects can be just as compelling as the more well-known examples, and now we have BogoSoft's Corn Kidz 64 continuing that trend with something decidedly retro. Following the adventures of a spunky goat named Seve, this title aims to emulate the spirit of an N64 platformer as accurately as possible. It largely succeeds; Corn Kidz 64 actually feels like a lost game from this era, and even though it has some notable shortcomings, this is overall an enjoyable and fun retro romp.\nCorn Kidz 64 is a true collectathon at heart, tasking you with picking up various doodads squirreled away in every imaginable corner of these modestly-sized playgrounds. Your main collectible is a large collection of cubes that grant you “XP” for each one you grab—after getting enough of them, you’ll be able to unlock doors that gate access to harder challenges that hide even more cubes. Additionally, there are other things to do, like knocking over all the trash cans in a level or finding a small collection of bottle caps to exchange for corn syrup, which raises your max health.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It's also increased the number of enemy patrols based on player numbers and tweaked the game's level generation, with the former making life more difficult in hell, and the latter possibly making things more interesting.\nRead more",

          "description": "Lethal Company is a fun game but I know what you're thinking: it lacks feline energy. Whilst the simplistic game loop of collecting scrap on monster-infested moons and selling it to an equally monstrous company is enjoyable at first, it can get old pretty fast. As both Alice and James have attested with their experiences of this month's RPS Game Club pick, Lethal Company is a game that lacks a certain direction the more you play. I soon found myself settling into an existential crisis, reminiscent of my tumultuous stint in retail. A recurring thought back then was why bother stacking shelves, only to have someone buy the products and make me re-stack them again?\nIn the vain hopes of gaining a higher purpose in Lethal Company, I stumbled across the 'Needy Cats' mod. Essentially this mod adds a variety of cats to your game that will wander around the facilities and yelp for attention.\nPerhaps I'm just a glutton for heartbreak, but I decided that the game needed a galactic sanctuary full of adorable balls of floof. I hearkened back to my time playing Stray, the adorable cat adventure set in a post-apocalypse where humanity was all but wiped out. Could this be the prequel to Lethal Company? What if all Apocalypse games share the same universe, all orchestrated by The Company secretly pulling the strings of fate? Or maybe I just wanted to look at cute cats instead of terrifying mannequin monsters. Either way, the cats needed help. What follows is a diary log of my adventures which soon lead to increasing madness and ultimately, disaster.\nRead more",

When will developer Zeekerss give us a proper singleplayer campaign mode, the loners of the gaming community wondered, peering from their boltholes and eyries. A Lethal Sole Trader, as it were - or failing that, how about some bot support? Well, this particular monkeypaw finger has curled. It curled about four years ago, actually, when Zeekerss released singleplayer-only horror compilation It Steals. \r\n\n\r\nI've been playing It Steals (available on Itch and Steam for £4 or $5) as part of our latest Lethal Company-dedicated Game Club, and let me tell you, it makes Lethal Company look positively, er, Nonlethal. There are many points of comparison between games, but while Lethal Company is geared more obviously for laughs, with its whoopie cushions and ReactionTube-friendly co-op mechanics, It Creeps just wants to scare you shitless. It's also brilliant.\r\n\n \nRead more",

This is true! It's also janky, and the RNG on the weird, warren-like buildings prompted me to ask \"Who designed this? What is this for? What kind of office is this??\" out loud, as I faced yet another dead end full of pipes. And yet! There's something about it that endears me to it far more than other similar games like Phasmophobia. Games like this all largely rely on you making your own fun with the tools they provide, but I think we should give the Lethal Company devs props for their tools, because they are weird and make no sense, and allow for some fantastic slapstick.\nRead more",

          "description": "The announcement trailer for Lost Legions opens with a Roman Emperor bellowing “GIVE ME BACK MY LEGIONS” like a kid who’s just had his pudding taken away. I'd just had a big swig of coffee before watching, and was instantly swept off by visions of an apoplectic Roman bigwig rampaging through the forests of darkest Germania, gluing abducted legionnaires together into a sort of Octavian katamari... and then they revealed that it’s another open world survival game, with no less than two trailer beats dedicated to the act of hacking down a tree. \r\n\n\r\nI mean no disrespect to developers Tarock Interactive - they're not to blame for my addled imagination - but there are many open world survival games and as a weary Ed Thorn recently noted, the majority are heavily frontloaded with wilderness carpentry. I don’t think survival games should emphasise wood-chopping in their announcement footage. It's like doing a Call of Duty montage of people getting shot three seconds from spawn. Still, if there's no katamari mechanic, the idea of raising a small army of mostly AI-controlled Roman soldiers behind enemy lines has a certain charm. Without further ado, here’s the trailer.\r\n \nRead more",

Timed to capitalise on the Fallout TV show's mad popularity, it'll encumber the 2015-released open world wasteland RPG with widescreen and ultra-widescreen support, Creation Kit fixes, and a \"variety of quest updates\" across Steam, Microsoft Store and GOG. There will be new items for the Creation Club, including the Makeshift Weapon Pack, which lets you blast people with a piggy bank like Elon Musk, and a new quest, Echoes Of The Past, in which you try to \"stop The Enclave from spreading their dangerous ideology and gaining a foothold in the Commonwealth\".\nThey're also bringing the game to the Epic Games Store and upgrading it to Steam Deck Verified status. Such days of bounty we do live through, but beware - it's possible the update will break existing Fallout 4 mods, which will be a problem for the very large numbers of you who've been downloading mods after watching the show. Indeed, the possibility of today's update messing with mods has already seen the creators of the promising Fallout: London delay release to assess the damage.

As I run back and forth from the ship, only able to carry four things at a time in my puny arms, I frequently see the various monster inhabitants of the game excelling at pretty much everything. The Forest Keeper has brawny strength and can travel across the map in a blink of an eye, the Eyeless Dogs can sniff out an intruder in next to no time and The Butler has dedicated his life to maintaining a mansion even after the owners have long since gone.\nThis had me thinking - surely the various monster inhabitants of Lethal Company would make for a much better worker than myself?\nSure, most of them are ravenous killing machines - but that fits with the core values of The Company. After all, most of your time spent in the game will be collecting scrap on distant moons to meet an arbitrary quota set by The Company. You'll then feed your pilfered belongings to the insatiable maw of a tentacled horror (otherwise known as the boss). You may be able to sympathise depending on your occupation.\nSo, if the monsters in Lethal Company were given the chance to work for said company, which of them would make it as an employee of the month and which would crash and burn harder than me getting thrown from the airlock five times in a row?\nJoin me as I peruse the CV's of my favourite monsters in Lethal Company (as far as I know only half of them have opposable thumbs) and advocate for which of them should be my replacement as The Company's new hire.

And the Viperling is a venomous variant of the existing Spineling (a thorny seaworm with hull-piercing porcupine-like spikes). But don't worry, the medical systems have also seen a \"mini-rework\", which means drugs like morphine are \"less of a 'solution for everything'\". Wait. What?\r\n\n\r\nSubmariners in the game can still use morphine, opium and fentanyl to ease the pain of a monster attack, broken bones, wrecked organs, or be-bulleted body. However, the developers feel these drugs have been over-used. So they've rebalanced the opiates as part of their Blood in the Water update. Now the drugs have \"a much higher risk of causing addiction and overdoses, and morphine heals much more slowly, making it less viable for combat-heavy situations.\" Well.

They are grim and dark and often have gimmicks that are a bit middling: mechanical arms that spew gunk, or turning to stone. Or they stand out with incredibly deep combat, with dense menus and rainbow loot. So, Another Crab's Treasure comes as a refreshing surprise, what with it's crustacean theme, platforming, and shell gimmick that actually complements fights in clever ways. Not only that, but it's colourful and funny, with plenty of challenge for veterans and plenty of difficulty tweaks for those who just want a good time. Trade cowpat for coral, I'd say.\nRead more",

          "description": "I went to see Civil War this weekend. I liked a bunch of it, didn't like a bunch of it. One thing I thought was very obvious is that it sanitises its titular conflict of any political context. On the one hand, I understand this as part of the theming, said almost directly into the camera by Kirsten Dunst's photojournalist character: as journalists they're there to observe, so other people ask questions. On the other hand, the civil war being between the government and the Western Forces, an alliance between California and Texas feels extremely \"Republicans buy sneakers too\", if you ask me.\nIt made me think about the Fallout TV show. One of the things I like about it is that it doesn't pretend The Brotherhood Of Steel aren't absolute mad lads (pejorative). Like, they're clearly not good news, and there isn't any attempt to make them seem like they are - just that they might seem that way from the point of view of a traumatised child being rescued from a fridge like a tiny Indiana Jones. Many of the video games I like pride themselves on offering choice to the player, but in reality they smooth over any bumps in the road to make the choices appear equal - rather than telling the player they are choosing between bad and good.\nRead more",

It presents as a locus of power, where your character avatar resides. Also, it’s right there in the title. I built mine down a side road, between oxen posts and granaries, for no real reason but free space. The more I play, the more it feels a fitting place. Not sidelined, exactly, just not especially loud. I need the taxes it brings to pay mercenaries to see off bandits, but lords - their whims and ambitions - don’t set the tone here. Parchment and seals aren’t as important as tilled earth; as winter snow, spring thaws and autumn harvests. So, despite the title, this sedate, curious, and intricate sim isn’t really about lords, nor manors. Not half as much, anyway, as it is about manure.\nRead more",

          "description": "I'm the kind of awful person who looks at the background actors in TV shows and wonders what life is like for e.g. the old woman who sells birdfeed in Trafalgar Square in Mary Poppins when said upper-middle class domestic isn't singing about her. What fate the Warcraft grunt when he is too old to work work? It's probably pretty bad, right? Now let me slop Innkeep down in front of you like a big bowl of rat stew. Developer Daniel Burke furnished me with a little playable slice, and boy, Innkeep is a grim old time. I mean that as a compliment.\nIn it you run a big pub with room for a lot of grizzled adventurers, in a dog-eat-dog dark fantasy RPG sort of a world - think a roadside pub in one of the early seasons of Game Of Thrones, before everyone hated it. You do a lot of plate-spinning drudgery like cooking, cleaning, and serving, but also eavesdropping, rumourmongering, and knowing when to slip in a ribald joke as a distraction while you size up a mercenary's sword.\nRead more",

Attempts have been made at cosy automation and automated cosiness in the past – Satisfactory is on the sunnier side, providing you enable the right settings, and Shapez 2 has lots of rounded edges. But IDK, there’s something about the ravages of mass industry that doesn’t quite gel with zoomorphic raccoon baristas and other such wholesome trappings. Have you ever encountered a cuddly smokestack? How about a cuddly just-in-time network?\nCombine cosiness with automation, and a lot of the time, you end up with some kind of macabre joke, like Palworld.

I've always felt that I, too, would like to one day find an artwork that I could describe in the same way. Partly because it sounds like an interesting experience, but mainly so I could steal that line and feel like one of those elite, urbanely perceptive, multiple trouser-owning critics.\nWell, today is not that day, because indie horror IRIS isn't, in fact, actively hostile towards the act of playing it. It's more a case of passive disdain. Is it a ‘good’ game? Probably not. Ah, but is it enjoyable? Buddy, not even slightly. But it is intriguing. I am intrigued, reader.\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Gray Zone Warfare is the latest extraction shooter to hit the market, and when you jump into the game for the first time, you'll be tasked with choosing which of the three factions you want to join. \n\n\nThe island of Lamang is embroiled in a war between the three groups and determines where your base camp is located, and who you can play with. That's because you can only team up with players in the same faction, so if you're jumping in with mates, select the same one. \n\n\nAll Gray Zone Warfare factions\n\n\nThe three factions in Gray Zone Warfare come with their own lore, as shared by MADFINGER Games:\n\n\n\nLamang Recovery Initiative: The LRI were founded and funded by a tech billionaire, and are a strictly philanthropic group searching for survivors around Ground Zero following the exit of the UN. Made up of \"highly professional security details,\" they are trying to rid the island of the other factions. \n\n\nMithras Security Systems: A private military company, MSS are not worried about what you did before you joined them, only what you can do now. Inspired by the Roman Legion system, any prizes and rewards are shared among the troops, making sure everyone is fighting for a common cause. \n\n\nCrimson Shield International: Becoming prominent during the Syrian Civil War, Crimson Shield's success rate is high, but their methods are questionable at best. Anyone is welcome to join, but a \"strict elimination process\" means only the best make it to active service. \n\n\n\nYour faction choose is important, as you can't switch whenever you please. Image via MADFINGER Games\n\n\nCan I change factions in Gray Zone Warfare?\n\n\nNo, you can't change factions in Gray Zone Warfare. The only time you can switch is during a server wipe, which will only happen every six months. That means you need to be certain when you join a faction, and make sure to communicate with your friends before you do so. \n\nThe post Gray Zone Warfare factions explained appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "If you want to see how you match up to your friends, or generally just take a look at your multiplayer performance, then checking your Kill/Death ratio is a good way to see it. If you don't know how, here's where to find your K/D ratio in MW3. \n\n\nWhen I first started playing Call of Duty way back in 2007, your K/D ratio was what told everyone how good you were at the game. I remember plenty of conversations at school where people would get absolutely roasted for being under a 1.00. \n\n\nWhile it's not talked about as much anymore, it's still handy to know how you're performing in the game, and if you want to check it, I can tell you how. \n\n\nI hope your K/D ratio is above 1.00. Image via Activision\n\n\nHow to see your K/D ratio in MW3\n\n\nTo see your Kill/Death ratio in MW3, simply follow the steps below. \n\n\n\nOn Modern Warfare 3's main menu, open the Start menu. (Press Start on your controller, or click on the boxes at the top right of your screen if using PC.)\n\n\nSelect the 'Stats\" option from the menu. \n\n\nSelect 'Multiplayer.'\n\n\n\nThis will show you your full Combat Record, including your K/D ratio and your win/loss ratio too.\n\n\nK/D ratio in MW3 explained\n\n\nYour Kill/Death ratio is used to show how many kills you get compared to your deaths. For example, if you got 20 kills and 20 deaths in a match, your K/D ratio would be 1.00, because for every kill you got, you also died. \n\n\nIf you got 20 kills but 10 deaths, your K/D ratio would be 2.00, and if you got 10 kills and 20 deaths, your K/D ratio would be 0.50. \n\nThe post How to check your K/D ratio in MW3 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Revealed in March 2023, Life by You gives players the creative freedom to design their own characters then build their homes and live out their lives, similar to popular long-running Electronic Arts series The Sims.\n\n\n\n\nFans of The Sims have had their eyes on Life by You since its announcement due to its similar approach but potential freedom to do more. While The Sims 4 seems to be in a never-ending DLC-release cycle—I'm not exaggerating when I say there is over $1,000 of DLC at this point—Life by You instead focuses on what makes life simulator games so fun in the first place: creative freedom. \n\n\nThe life simulator also features deep Creator and Editor tools such as its Character Creator, Object Designer, Language Trees, and more, allowing ease of access for players to create, customize, and even mod Life by You to fit their story. Former Electronic Arts Executive Vice President and Head of The Sims label at EA Rod Humble thinks this is what makes Life by You so special.\n\n\n\n\"At the core of Life by You is the player community. We’ve created a sandbox where players can tell whatever story they want. From deeply personal, esoteric, or fan fiction, they can live life to the fullest - or break the rules as they see fit!”\n- Rod Humble, General Manage of Paradox Tectonic\n\n\n\nIn development since 2019, Life by You had originally scheduled to enter Early Access earlier this year in March. However, the team opted to delay Early Access by about three months to put some finishing touches on the visuals and further improve the gameplay.\n\n\nLife by You enters Early Access on Steam and the Epic Games Store on June 4. \n\nThe post The Sims-inspired life simulator Life by You coming to Early Access June 4 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "While many of us might still be upset about some significant nerfs in the latest patch in Helldivers 2, there is something that has many scratching their heads. What is a Fog Generator? Health and armor? What are Fog Generators in Helldivers 2?\n\n\nTo clear up some confusion, here’s what we think is going on.\n\n\nWhat are Fog Generators in Helldivers 2?\n\n\nIf you noticed in the Enemies section that “Fog Generators” had an increase in their health and armor, the patch notes refer to Spore Spewers. These are the giant mushrooms that create all that green mist on Terminid missions.\n\n\nIt was theorized that this was the case after patch notes hit, and we tested it ourselves and found that Spore Spewers did indeed take longer to kill than before. Why they weren’t referred to as Spore Spewers in the patch notes did have a lot of players wondering what these were. \n\n\nIn any case, with them now being harder to kill, it does mean that it’s going to take a lot more shots from a gun like the Plasma Scorcher, or the recently nerfed R-36 and Quasar Cannon. These were some of the easier objectives to take on since you can snipe these with explosive weapons. \n\n\nNow, you’d have to throw something heavier at them or just shoot more explosive ordinance at them to make these side objectives actually challenging. Sure, the only challenging aspect of Spore Spewers or “fog generators” is that they limit your sight when you’re close by.\n\n\nImage via PlayStation's YouTube channel\n\n\nEasy way to take down Spore Spewers post-patch\n\n\nYou can still use the old methods you use to take these down. If you want a sure-shot kill on these, using a call-down Stratagem like an Eagle 500KG Bomb, Orbital Railcannon Strike, or anything with big single-target damage can take care of it. \n\n\nIf you do just want to gun it down, make sure enemies are cleared so that you aren’t caught in the middle of a reload.\n\nThe post What are Fog Generators in Helldivers 2?

However, it's quite tricky to find within the menus of the game. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nHow to complete reports in Sims 4\n\n\nTo be able to fill out reports in The Sims 4, you'll need to have a character within the Business career path. For example, the first entry job you can get is a Mailroom Technician. Once you've gained that job, buy any computer and place it on an available table as you can see in the above image.  You may even want to rotate it around, so it fits in your house perfectly.\n\n\nNext, interact with it with the left mouse button. Pick the following options:\n\n\n\nMore choices\n\n\nWeb\n\n\nFill Out Reports\n\n\n\nThere's a suitcase symbol right next to the \"Fill Out Reports\" option as well, and it's in green font. Once you select that, it will only take a few moments for your Sim to complete the task. \n\n\nWhat else can you do on the computer?\n\n\nThe computer opens up so many opportunities for your Sim. You can write jokes, check your social media timeline, find a job, and much more. Programming might be another option for your Sim, and you can elevate their skills in that by choosing \"Practice Programming.\" Writing is another skill they can practice.  You can even adopt a child for $1,000.\n\n\nSimilar to real life, a PC can open up the world for your Sim, but make sure they're performing other duties too like exercising, socializing, and most importantly, going to work to earn that sweet, sweet moolah. Mods could certainly help your Sim as well.\n\nThe post How to fill out reports in Sims 4 appeared first on Destructoid.",

The absolutely bonkers-looking open-world game is PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and Windows in 2025.\n\n\nIn Promise Mascot Agency, you play as Michi, a disgraced Yakuza member who is put in charge of the titular agency for mascots, and you must turn the business around. While trying to run a legitimate-ish business, he must also unravel the conspiracy that led to his exile.\n\n\nAlso, you’re helped along the way by Pinky, who seems to be an anthropomorphic severed finger.\n\n\n\n\nLike Paradise Killer, Promise Mascot Agency is an open-world game. It takes place in an area called Kaso-Machi, and you get a pretty sweet truck to drive around in. But beyond just solving crime, you also have to actually manage the mascots who come to you for representation. This often leads to hilarious hijinks where you help these abominations using “Hero Cards” to get them out of trouble.\n\n\nIt looks spectacular. I reviewed Paradise Killer way back when it was released. It was one of my favorite games of that year, and has stuck with me since. You probably could have struck my interest with “from the developers of Paradise Killer,” but the trailer delivers beyond that with just a feverish representation of Japan. Damn, I’m excited.\n\n\nUnfortunately, I have quite a while to wait, as Promise Mascot Agency launches on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and Windows in 2025.\n\nThe post Paradise Killer devs return to bizarre crime drama with open world Promise Mascot Agency appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Jackbox Games revealed the next chapter of Jackbox during the 2024 ID@Xbox Showcase would also be the developer's first M-rated title: Jackbox Naughty Pack. The intimate pack of three games is due to be released this year and marks Jackbox's first foray into the world of mature gaming with three provocative games designed specifically for adult players.\n\n\n\n\nWhat's in the box?\n\n\nAccording to Jackbox, an overwhelming number of fans have indicated in customer feedback surveys that they want an adult-theme Jackbox Party Pack, which is just what the team is doing with Jackbox Naughty Pack. The three adult-themed games will still deliver on the promise of making you laugh, while also adding a more risque style of entertainment than is present in the previous iterations of the Party Pack.\n\n\nPrevious Jackbox titles only require one person to own the game while others can access the party-style gameplay using their own at-home devices such as phones, tablets, laptops, and PCs as long as they have an internet connection. This makes me ponder two questions immediately: Who's going to create a Jackbox Naughty Pack lobby and invite their friends, and what sort of devices are compatible with this pack? Actually, I'm not sure I want to know.\n\n\nJackbox Naughty Pack is set to release later this year, and the team plans to reveal more information about its three adult-only titles throughout the summer.\n\nThe post Jackbox is about to get a little freaky with Jackbox Naughty Pack appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "As part of the ID@Xbox Digital Showcase, Poncle has released an amazing update for Vampire Survivors completely out of nowhere. The Laborratory update drops today and is as bewildering as it is spectacular.\n\n\nI’m at a bit of a loss here because Poncle already does a better job at covering their big reveals than I could ever hope to. Whatever devious bastard they have in charge of their bulleted lists has them down to an artform. They describe it as their first “AAAA” update, and say it includes “1 character, 1 secret character, 3 weapons, and 2 stages, including a bonus go-cart racing stage.” They go on to say that the update also has “industry-defining innovations include fully rendered running animations, mind-blowing train physics, go-cart racing, and doors that open.”\n\n\n\n\nDamn! After all these years, they finally caved to the demands of the community and added their most fervently requested feature: Opening doors. So much for having principles.\n\n\nThe Holiday-themed update arrives just in time for that special season when big-box retailers roll out the Christmas playlist to inspire the rabid consumer in all of us.\n\n\nIf you’re confused and thinking that a Contra-themed update was supposed to be released around this time, I have good news. That wasn’t just a shared hallucination. Vampire Survivor: Operation Guns is right around the corner on May 9, 2024.\n\n\nAs for the Vampire Survivors Laborratory Update, it’s free and will be released for all platforms today.\n\nThe post Vampire Survivors gets a mindbending surprise update today, includes opening doors appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "From former Alabama head coach Nick Saban to previous Heisman winners, college football fans have made many predictions about who will be on the EA Sports College Football 25 cover. After months of speculation, a leak may help narrow down the field of potential candidates. \n\n\nCollege football reporter Matt Brown reports that the EA Sports College Football 25 will have multiple cover athletes for different title editions, featuring current players across multiple power conferences. Additionally, Brown claimed that all athletes play different positions, meaning there would only be one quarterback, running back, and more. Based on that set of criteria, there are a few noteworthy college athletes that check every box. \n\n\n\n\n\nTexas quarterback Quinn Ewers, Colorado quarterback Shadeur Sanders, Colorado receiver and cornerback Travis Hunter, and Georgia quarterback Carson Beck will be at the top of most college football fan wishlists. However, potentially only having one QB would make that list of top candidates much smaller. \n\n\nThis would also rule out all players who officially got drafted into the NFL over the weekend. Caleb Williams, Drake Maye, Jayden Daniels, Marvin Harrison Jr, and Malik Nabers could have been phenomenal candidates after shining on the field last season, but they have reportedly missed their window. \n\n\nAs for when players can finally get their hands on the highly anticipated sports sim title, leaks point toward a July 19 release date, with more information to come earlier in the summer.  \n\nThe post EA Sports College Football 25 will reportedly feature current players on the cover appeared first on Destructoid.",

With eight total Shikai in PM at the moment, you may be wondering which is the best Shikai in Project Mugetsu. Here's what you should look for.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nBest Shikai in Project Mugetsu\n\n\nThe best Shikai in Project Mugetsu as of Update 2 is the Nozarashi (Kenpachi) Legendary Shikai that was added in Update 2. Even though the new Ichimonji (Ichibei) Legendary Shikai is also very strong, it has no heal making it fall out of favor when compared to Bankai.\n\n\nHowever, an already existing Shikai, the Ryujin Jakka is also incredibly powerful with certain builds. The new Minazuki (Unohana) Legendary Shikai is also a solid choice, but is not quite as good as the Nozarashi or even Ryujin Jakka.\n\n\nProject Mugetsu (PM) Shikai Tier List in Update 2\n\n\nBeing Legendary Shikai, Nozarashi and Ryujin Jakka aren't exactly the easiest to acquire. As such, we've put together a Shikai Tier List updated for Update 2 of Project Mugetsu that includes all eight Shikai so you know what to work towards. \n\n\nYou'll want to strive towards obtaining the S Tier Shikai, but even the A Tier ones are formidable options. The B Tier Shikai are versatile enough to be worthwhile until you're able to move on to A or S Tier ones, and the C Tier Shikai should be avoided for the most part except in specific scenarios. Here is our Project Mugetsu Shikai Tier List as of Update 2:\n\n\nS Tier\n\n\n\nNozarashi\n\n\nRyujin Jakka\n\n\nMinazuki\n\n\n\nA Tier\n\n\n\nIchimonji\n\n\nSenbonzakura\n\n\n\nB Tier\n\n\n\nKamishini\n\n\n\nC Tier\n\n\n\nHyorinmaru\n\n\nZangetsu\n\n\nThe post Best Shikai in Project Mugetsu (PM) appeared first on Destructoid.",

But players have found it's lacking something: the companions of Baldur's Gate 3. \n\n\nNot to worry, though, as Stardew Valley modder Xun and their team are working on bringing a map and various characters from Baldur's Gate 3 to Stardew Valley.\n\n\n\n\nWhat parts of Baldur's Gate 3 are coming to Stardew Valley in Baldur's Village?\n\n\nVia Twitter, Xun mentions that their mod, Baldur's Village, will introduce a new map and four Baldur's Gate 3 cast members. You'll get to interact with fan-favorites Shadowheart, Halsin, Gale, and, naturally, Astarion.\n\n\nThe mod team says that only Astarion gets to be dateable right now, but Xun assures that Astarion will feature a unique romance plot and that more characters could join the dating roster in the future if things go well.\n\n\nThe mod still isn't out, but Xun's team has already completed the artwork for the map of Baldur's Village, four different styles of buildings, and the designs of Astarion, Shadowheart, and Gale. Below you can check out Astarion in one of many pieces of artwork teased by Xun:\n\n\nImage by Xun\n\n\nXun closes by thanking Himetarts and Wildflour for the creation of some free assets used in Baldur's Village. You can check out their mods here.\n\n\nThe team hopes to release the first part of Baldur's Village before the first anniversary of Baldur's Gate 3.

In 2022, Housemarque stated it was developing a new IP for its next title. However, that wouldn't necessarily rule out the possibility of more Returnal DLC, if nothing else. Much has changed for Housemarque since Returnal launched in April 2021, such as being acquired by Sony just a couple of months later. Returnal launched on PC in February 2023 and has been updated with additional content and features such as co-op. \nThankfully, we don’t have to wait long to learn what Housemarque has up its sleeve next. In the meantime, be sure to check out our review of Returnal here.",

The company states the event will return in the future, but it plans to showcase upcoming games in a different manner over the coming months. \nFirst announced in a blog post, Blizzard plans to share details on upcoming games like World of Warcraft: The War Within and Diablo IV’s Vessel of Hatred expansion at other trade shows, such as Gamescom. The company also plans to launch “multiple, global, in-person events” for Warcraft’s 30th anniversary, which are described as being “distinct” from BlizzCon. \n“Our hope is that these experiences – alongside several live-streamed industry events where we’ll keep you up to date with what’s happening in our game universes – will capture the essence of what makes the Blizzard community so special,” Blizzard states in the blog post.\nA Blizzard representative tells Windows Central that Blizzard made the call to cancel BlizzCon and not Microsoft, which completed its acquisition of the company last year. In a statement to the outlet, the representative says, “This is a Blizzard decision. We have explored different event formats in the past, and this isn't the first time we're skipping BlizzCon or trying something new. While we have great things to share in 2024, the timing just doesn’t line up for one single event at the end of the year.”\nBlizzCon began in 2005 as an annual convention celebrating all things Blizzard. Last year's show saw the reveal of World of Warcraft’s next expansion, The War Within, as well as two other expansions coming after it. It's good that event is only taking a year off as opposed to being canned for good, and we're curious to see how the alternative events shape up over the coming months.",

          "description": "Dragon's Dogma 2 launched a little over a month ago and has already managed to sell 2.5 million copies, but Capcom is still releasing updates to patch minor issues with the game. While a large volume of complaints have been about the lack of a performance mode, this update (like the last update) does not address that issue. However, it does aim to clean up a number of irritating errors involving the behavior of pawns, the player's AI companions.\nAn update for Dragon's Dogma 2 is now live on all platforms!\nhttps://t.co/waEdG0ntSv\nApril 25, 2024\nFor starters, this update makes it easier to detect dragonsplague, an affliction that, if untreated, can lead to devastating consequences for your pawns and your world. It's also contagious, so it's a good idea to nip it in the bud as soon as you first encounter it. When afflicted, pawns' eyes will glow red – after this update, they'll glow more noticeably. The update also causes the disease to infect pawns less frequently.\nPawns should also be a lot less annoying now, thanks to a whole slate of minor refinements to their behavior. They'll jump off cliffs less often (which is hilarious but a wild inconvenience), say some lines less often, say other lines at more appropriate times and become less likely to offer to be hired while passing by on the street. They're one of the highlights of the game, so anything done to make their constant presence more consistent is always welcome.\nThere are also smaller adjustments, like adding the ability to zoom in on a character's face in shops, preventing monster attacks in town from leading to the player's arrest, and other miscellaneous bug fixes. You can read the full list of updates, as well as all past updates, here.",

          "description": "Taming a wolf in Minecraft is one of the game's simplest joys, and no matter how many times I start a new world, I always hoard bones in case I encounter one. But once you've adopted a canine companion, you probably hide them away in a house for safe-keeping, shielding them from the horrors of the game's hostile mobs. Today, Minecraft is adding a way to make them a little stronger – wolf armor.\n\n\nLike leather armor, wolf armor can be colored using dyes in-game, so if you've got multiple adopted animals, it'll still be easy to tell them apart. This variation is separate from the collar colors as well, creating plenty of possibilities. Even better, the game is also adding wolf fur variants for the first time, bringing eight new patterns for a total of nine. Each variant (Pale, Woods, Ashen, Black, chestnut, Rusty, Spotted, Striped, and Snowy) spawns in a specific biome. You can take a look at all the new breeds in the gallery below.\n\nOf course, players will need to be able to craft this wolf armor as well, which is where the new mob, the armadillo, comes in. These armored relatives of anteaters can be found in savannah or badland biomes, where they can be seen strolling around and curling into a defensive ball when certain enemies come near. Armadillos drop armadillo scutes, which are used to make the wolf armor, but the developers have reassured players that they can be brushed rather than defeated, so you won't have to go on an armadillo massacre to protect your pets. Armadillos can also be used to scare away spiders since they eat insects and arachnids in real life, and spider eyes can be used to breed them if you want to make your own armadillo farm.\nYou can read the rest of the notes for the 1.20.5 update right here.",

Epic says players who have these emotes hidden with this new setting will see a player using the emote standing still, with no emote sound. \nThis new setting can be found under \"Social Privacy\" in the Fortnite settings and it defaults to only show these confrontational emotes from friends in your party. Epic stresses that this setting does not change a player's ability to use any emotes. It is now live in-game. \nFor more about Fortnite, check out these Avatar: The Last Airbender skins now available in the game, and then read about how Fortnite's next Star Wars crossover will span Lego, Fortnite Festival, and Battle Royale.

It seems our protagonist and the friends and allies they encounter along the way are vying for a crown that others are also after. In order to claim it, players must complete trials across the lands, proving their worth. \nCheck it out for yourself in the Metaphor: ReFantazio gameplay trailer below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Metaphor: ReFantazio continues to look excellent, with its Persona inspirations on full display. That's not surprising, though, considering Studio Zero is composed of various leads from Atlus' popular Persona series, including the latest in the franchise, Persona 5. \nIf you've played Persona 5 Royal, or even the recently released Persona 3 Reload, then you know we're likely in for a treat when it comes to a few things: combat, narrative, and art. And if this new look at the game's menu are any indication, the Persona team has been cooking something special for Metaphor: ReFantazio. \nThe trailer also reveals Metaphor: ReFantazio will get a special Collector's Edition for $149.99.

Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.\nJoin Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

Although this technically isn’t an official announcement either, I'd say there's roughly a 99.99 percent chance that Black is involved.\nThe Minecraft movie, which has been in development in some form or another since 2014, is directed by Nacho Libre director Jared Hess. The cast includes Jason Momoa (Aquaman, Game of Thrones), Danielle Brooks (The Color Purple), Jennifer Coolidge (The White Lotus, American Pie), and Emma Myers (Wednesday). Minecraft is scheduled to hit theaters on April 4, 2025. \nJack Black is obviously no stranger to video game movies. He voiced Bowser in The Super Mario Bros.

          "description": "With huge winter game releases behind us and huge summer announcements right around the corner, the games industry is set for a relatively quiet month or two. Luckily, Nintendo plans to briefly step in to fill that void. Today, it announced the next Indie World Showcase, a live stream event focused on the latest indie titles to come to the Switch, for tomorrow, April 17. The showcase will air at 7 AM PT/10 AM ET and last for around 20 minutes.\nNew #IndieWorld Showcase incoming! 💡\n\nTune in tomorrow, 4/17 at 7am PT for roughly 20 minutes of announcements and updates on indie games headed to #NintendoSwitch in 2024.\n\nWatch live here: https://t.co/jGiccyBhME pic.twitter.com/V31Dfuxs0N\nApril 16, 2024\nIt's in the name so it might be obvious to some, but don't expect any first-party games or hardware announcements out of this event. An Indie World Showcase is also not the same thing as a Nintendo Partner Showcase, which is just a show about third party games. This can include indie titles (the last one had a trailer for Another Crab's Treasure, for example) but also includes larger developers, like Sega or Atlus.\nIf that's confusing, you can get a sense of the games that have been showcased in this type of presentation in the past by visiting the official Indie World site. Fans will most likely be clamoring for a trailer or release date for Hollow Knight: Silksong, the sequel to the 2017 bug-themed Metroidvania. But while it's (hopefully) right around the corner, there's no specific reason to believe it will appear at this event other than the fact that it's an indie game coming to the Switch.\nWe won't know until the Indie World Showcase properly airs tomorrow. When it does, you can watch it right here.",

The outlet’s sources report that the John Wick and Matrix star is voicing Shadow the Hedgehog.\nSonic the Hedgehog 3 is set to premiere on December 20 and will pit Shadow alongside a returning Dr. Robotnik (played by Jim Carrey) against Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles. The returning cast includes Ben Schwartz, Idris Elba, James Marsden, and Colleen O'Shaughnessey. The film's first trailer premiered in front of a select audience at Cinemacon in Las Vegas last week and it provided the first real look at Shadow. Unfortunately, the trailer has yet to be publically released. \nParamount has yet to officially confirm Reeves' casting, but if this is true, he will join fellow new cast members, including Krysten Ritter, Alyla Browne, James Wolk, Sofia Pernas, Cristo Fernández, and Jorma Taccone. Shadow's debut was teased at the end of Sonic the Hedgehog 2, but his voice performer has been a tantalizing mystery since the third film was announced in August 2022. \nMeanwhile, the standalone Knuckles series premieres on Paramount Plus on April 26. You can watch the first full-length trailer for that here.\n[Source: The Hollywood Reporter]",

As such, Square Enix has released a new benchmark software to let PC players test how well their machines will handle these new bells and whistles while getting a small head start on Dawntrail.\nAvailable as a free download for Windows, the benchmark software uses playable characters and actual maps to assign a performance score to your PC. This will provide a peek at the new graphical update, which spruces up the game with enhanced textures, shadows, material qualities, and other elements. You can download the benchmark here. \nThe benchmark includes a character creator for players to craft a fresh hero ahead of Dawntrail’s launch. It also includes access to the new female Hrothgar race. Existing characters can also be imported into the benchmark, and the appearance data from these characters can be imported into the full release of Dawntrail on Windows. \nFinal Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail launches on July 2. You can learn more about the expansion here. The game currently has a crossover event with Final Fantasy XVI that runs until May 8",

          "description": "Total Eclipse, a real-time, curse-breaking, 3D adventure (with a dash of Indiana Jones flair), is ready for public testing!\nOriginally unleashed by Incentive Software Ltd. in 1988, Total Eclipse added yet another groundbreaking title to their repertoire of revolutionary games.\nStep into the shoes of a heroic archeologist on October 26, 1930, as a total solar eclipse akin to the one happening today over North America looms over Cairo. Knowing of the Ardognus prophecy, created by the powerful high priest Hahmid III, you must find and destroy the hidden shrine devoted to Ra before the eclipse occurs.\nEmbark on this exciting journey packed with a trusty gun for blasting through doors or dispatching undead mummies; a compass to guide you through a treacherous pyramid; a wristwatch to track the precious time left; and a water bottle to fight dehydration (you’re only human after all). \nCan you solve this ancient mystery within 120 minutes and avert catastrophe, or will Rah's wrath obliterate the moon?\nOur modern reimplementation of the Freescape engine features graphics using hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Total Eclipse support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum, and Amstrad CPC. More releases are coming at a later date. Additionally, there are three playable demos if you want to test the game. Please contact us if you have some other release or demo.\nTo play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.\n>",
