          "description": "\"This isn't good, is it?\".\nWhen we attended a hands-on session for Konami's upcoming Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1, we were undoubtedly disappointed to find that Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty and Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater were both running at 30fps on Switch. This is depite the fact that both HD versions ran at 60fps back in 2012 when released for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.\nWhile we were unable to definitively confirm at the time whether the games ran at the same frame rate on other systems, Konami has now provided a statement to us and other outlets to clarify that it is only the Switch release that is targeting 30fps. All other platforms will target the games at 60fps.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

WayForward’s Xtreme Sports draws influence from California Games, a summery seaside boardwalk of hip events and addictive tap-a-thons. You have two characters to choose from, dude or girlfriend dudette, who face off in various tricky sporting events that scream early '00s gnarlyness.\nXtreme Sports, originally a 2000 Game Boy Color title, was graphically impressive for Nintendo’s colour handheld, and the portrait and character art will be familiar to anyone ingratiated with WayForward’s pirate platformer, Shantae. The visuals are bold, colourful, and cleanly arranged, each minigame functioning well around a two-button control scheme. As well as a piecemeal practice mode, the story game features an island over-world with various NPCs who shape your bid for podium gold, and energy drinks that offer a competitive advantage. To enter the tournament proper where the challenge is increased, you first need to complete the training rounds. There are five events to tackle: skateboarding, in-line skating, street luge, surfing, and skyboarding.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It’s a magical wizardry mix of genres that still feels fresh today, even though it’s been five years since it released. It’s story following a group of ethereal exiles playing fantasy sports ball in mystical purgatory isn’t half bad too (by which I mean it’s amazing).\nThe rules of the sport are simple - two teams are placed at opposite ends of a pitch each with a flame  (the titular pyre) they must protect. An energy ball appears on the map and the two teams must grab the ball and dunk it into the opponent’s flame until that flame has been snuffed out. Each character has a special ability, movement feels good, and when you pull off a combo you feel fantastic.\nRead more",

          "description": "Developer Sad Cat Studios have delayed their debut cyberpunk platformer Replaced into 2024, because they “can’t afford to release a sub-par game.” The Belarusian-based studio previously pushed the game from 2022 into 2023 due to the ongoing war in Ukraine, but based on its moody retrofuturist trailers I’m happy to wait until every pixel is perfectly positioned, as long as the teams are staying safe.\r\n\n\r\n“After Replaced's initial announcement in 2021 and its follow-up trailer in 2022 we had this incredibly high bar of community's expectations,” the studio wrote in a recent Steam blog. “And at this point, we knew that we can't afford to release a sub-par game. We truly want Replaced to be something special and memorable for everybody. This is our first game, and we want to make every aspect of it the best it can be.”\r\n\n \nRead more",

This incoming mod for the seminal 2004 FPS will, in the style of Portal with RTX, rejig the original game with modern technical goodies like ray tracing, updated environmental details, and Nvidia Reflex support. DLSS will also be on hand to absorb the inevitably mahoosive performance hit from bouncing all those rays around, and that includes DLSS 3, provided you have a compatible graphics card.\nIt’s being developed by a collective of experienced HL2 modders, Orbifold Studios, without direct input from Valve. No release date yet, as Half-Life 2 RTX – or to use its full name, Half-Life 2 RTX: An RTX Remix Project – is still in the early stages. There is a teaser trailer, though.\nRead more",

          "description": "As someone whose auto-battler experience has, up until now, only been limited to minor forays into the excellent Alice0-recommended Super Auto Pets, sitting down to play a run of Tales & Tactics was somewhat overwhelming. Recently launched into early access and made by the same team behind Slay The Spire's popular Downfall mod, this is a fantasy autobattler cloaked in the skin of a roguelike. That means that in addition to creating an army of tabletop-esque miniatures to do your automatic bidding on a grid-based board, you'll also be picking from randomly generated opponents on a lightly branching story map as you sword chop your way to your ultimate goal: The Grand Tournament. \nIt's an intriguing combo, but as a relative newcomer to the auto-battling genre, there's maybe a bit too much going on here for its own good. That's not to say I haven't had a good time with it so far, but there are so many things to juggle in my brain that I feel like I'm fumbling my way through it by chance rather than making confident and informed tactical choices.\nRead more",

After this and Forspoken releasing within a few months of each other, I’m half expecting Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 to open with Captain Price shooting GPU-smelting laser beams out of his 'tache.\nIndeed, this first person sorcery adventure will be hell on your hardware, even if you’ve tooled up with a high-grade graphics card and CPU. This is somewhat more understandable than with the other low-performing PC games we’ve seen this year, as Immortals of Aveum is one of the first Unreal Engine 5.1 games, and makes extensive use of its sparkly new lighting and VFX tech. Sadly, it also aims so high that the only way to get playable performance on lower-end and older mid-range kit it to gut the quality settings.\nRead more",

Keep it there for as long as you can. Hurts after a while, huh? This is the default position for Jak, awesome FPS wizard with a magic gun arm, and possessor of a personality so inoffensive that when I am not playing the game I struggle to remember he exists. I noticed how hard it is to hold your arm in wizard mode when I was about 10 hours into the 20-or-so span of Immortals Of Aveum, and half way through is too early for a game to make me go all Cinema Sins out of boredom.\nDespite this, I very much appreciate Immortals Of Aveum taking a crack at a good old-fashioned mid-length action adventure. There are shining moments where it's great fun (though sometimes by accident; I have never, in my life, laughed so hard at some tiny wee orphans being exploded in front of me), but it's let down by its FPS combat becoming too repetitive too early, which is the kiss of death for a game built around shooting stuff. It also commits the terrible crime of taking itself too seriously, but then I level that charge at most fantasy I encounter.\nRead more",

Firewatch is, quite simply, a very lovely game, and one that I happily revisit on a fairly regular basis.\nI think the main draw of Firewatch, for me, is the forest. I am one of those people who's often happiest on a day-long hike into the middle of nowhere; and when life doesn't provide me with the opportunity to do something as often as I'd like, I'll turn to thematically appropriate video games to tide me over.\nDon't get me wrong: Firewatch's central story of Henry and Delilah is a good one, and the marvellous Cissy Jones deservedly picked up a BAFTA for her performance as the latter. But the free-roam mode is, to my mind, just as important for ensuring Firewatch's enduring appeal.\n Read more",

          "description": "Developer Cardboard Computer sporadically released their poetic adventure game, Kentucky Route Zero, in acts spread across multiple years. It was a teasing release schedule that only aided the game’s surreal mystery, so it’s no surprise that the studio have dropped the game’s first major update three years after the fifth and final chapter wrapped things up. The aptly named Postmodern Update overhauls the game’s user interface with a new Modern mode, alongside a host of bug fixes and more language options. \r\n\n\r\n“The new ‘Modern’ interface is designed to be more flexible and readable on a wider variety of devices, including tablets and the Steam Deck,” the studio wrote in a recent Steam blog. Kentucky Route Zero’s smaller acts and text-based nature make it almost perfect for on-the-go devices, although I’m more interested in using the game as bedtime reading instead, as someone who regrettably bounced off of it in the early acts. “We've also overhauled and improved the ‘Classic’ interface from the original release, and its lo-fi companion, ‘Retro,’” the studio also wrote.\r\n\n\r\nThe update also lets you “zoom in on details in the scene,” which sounds handy for smaller screens. New translations now support Arabic, Chinese, Polish, Thai, Swedish, Turkish, and Brazilian Portuguese, too.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "It's hard to know where to start with Six Ages 2 Colon Lights Going Out. The initial uncertainty and esoteric nature of its world has always been the series' biggest problem, as it appears to demand a lot of foreknowledge to play. But rather than memorising facts and (ugh) \"lore\", it's a series that encourages a different mindset to pretty much any other game. These games are about culture and myth, and how both interact and change over time.\nIt's harder, though, to write about this entry without just repeating myself. It is a Part Two of a planned three, thus much the same as before, yet different in some interesting, but esoteric ways. Do I try to convince the unfamiliar, detail those differences for fans, or try to cover both and succeed in neither?\nRead more",

A slightly longer and much improved sequel, Killer Bean 2: The Party, was released in 2000.\r\n\nNow it's getting a video game from original creator Jeff Lew, and it's an open world, first- and third-person roguelike shooter with the same acrobatic, John Woo-inspired combat as the nearly thirty-year-old animations.

One is about visiting strange new worlds, establishing outposts and shooting or romancing the heck out of the locals, while the other maroons you on a single asteroid.

Primarily, the exceedingly excellent Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew, but also Harebrained Scheme's upcoming turn-based tactics 'em up, The Lamplighters League, a game I've been quietly looking forward to ever since it was announced earlier this year.\nSpecifically, I've been playing through a handful of missions from the middle of The Lamplighters League's campaign, getting to grips with its full roster of agents and their unique set of skills. It continues to be just as stylish as the opening mission I played in May, but I'm not gonna lie. I've had quite a bit of whiplash coming straight from Shadow Gambit into this, but even if I'd arrived fresh and green, I don't think even all my years of tactics playing and XCOM-liker-liking would have been enough to prepare me for just how gosh darn difficult it is. \nRead more",

          "description": "The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood is many, magical things, but initially, at least, it is a card game in which you create your own cards. This takes the form of an MS Paint-esque editor in which you glue together a background, character assets and a collection of props, rotating, duplicating and altering the size of each asset with the mouse. Each asset soaks up a certain amount of arcane energy, divided between the four elements, which mean somewhat different things here than in the spell systems of other games. And each final design generates a different combination of meanings, some of them contradictory at a glance, all of them keys to the game’s weird, whimsical and sorrowful wider universe.\nIt seems an overly rudimentary system at first, though that’s coming from the perspective of somebody who’s reasonably familiar with Tarot, one of the game’s chief influences, and partial to devising their own crummy decks of visual poetry cards. In particular, I grumped to myself about the limits on shrinking and enlarging: I wanted to fashion more abstract, prog-rock designs with faces in pixellated close-up, whereas The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood sort of defaults to “dude holding thing against landscape” setups familiar from the Rider-Waite Tarot. While there are pieces you can plug in and leave out as you see fit, the system also insists that you include certain props from each batch, and I’ll admit to using the layer tool to hide unwanted skulls, floral wands and so forth behind other assets. \nRead more",

The humans in this far-flung future don’t even remember their ancestral home - it’s just a rumour, a fantasy. Yet that rumour is driving scientist Lisa, as it may be all that humanity has left. Players control a robot, Emeth, trained by the humans Lisa and Makoto to ‘find’ Earth, in the hope that reconnecting with the past will solve the issues facing humanity in the present.\r\n\n\r\nOpus may lean into the sci-fi aspects with its visuals and setting, but The Day We Found Earth and its sequels, 2018's Rocket Of Whispers and 2021's Echo Of Starsong (which Katharine absolutely loved), are ultimately story-driven games with a human core far warmer than the coldness of space. Sigono announced a new entry, Opus: Prism Peak, earlier this year. \"They’re narrative adventure titles that have heartfelt stories that always touch on themes of love and self-fulfilment,\" is what studio co-founder Scott Chen emphasises to me, as we start our conversation on the hectic floor of Bitsummit, Japan’s largest indie games event.\r\n\n \nRead more",

You only have a few seconds to pick one and dive through, sweating in the knowledge that each door leads to a confusing network of corridors that exist wholly apart from each other - that each door not opened is a route to an Elsewhere you are doomed to never know, unless you're commissioned to do a, haha, \"retrospective\" 10 years later.\nThis summer, in my previous dishonourable capacity as a freelancer, I barged through the doors marked \"Zelda\" and \"Final Fantasy 16\", then spent a frantic moment trying to force the \"Baldur's Gate 3\" door, before giving up and throwing myself under a heap of unedited features. Now, in the relative lull before the monster named Starfield crashes through the ceiling (yes, I know, I'm mixing my scenarios - it's the end of the day and I'm tired), I emerge from the heap reborn as RPS News Editor, and peer back fearfully at some of the doors I left unopened.

Extremely debatable.\nHammerwatch 2 is out today, and it's kind of an isometric RPG that you can play in multiplayer, and which is at base kind of hacky-and-slashy, but has stacking complexity the more you play. It's like paying for ex-special forces lads to read a choose your own adventure book to you, but they get really into doing the voices. I feel comfortable describing the pixel art as \"adorable\", and it makes everything seem like it's a cute little miniature you can hold in your hand. Hence Mighty Max, which was a key part of my childhood. I don't want to say that Hammerwatch 2 is easy, because that isn't quite right and there's some jank lurking in there.

Style can't fix a bad game, but it can elevate a decent one about, say, a little hand-drawn 2D samurai running across the world stabbing dudes for peace. Little Jinmu does a lot of running to the right, a lot of slashing, and probably very little parrying and punching once you figure out the power attack.\r\n\n\r\nThere is, bluntly, not a lot to it, especially while its online mode is still listed as \"coming soon\". But even with remote multiplayer, I see this as more of a diversion for friends to enjoy than a serious competitive fighter and intentionally so.\r\n\n\r\nI enjoyed it though. Actually, I think I enjoyed it more for that, though it does perhaps limit its audience.\r\n\n \nRead more",

And, against my expectations, and despite basically being a vehicle for logic grid puzzles, Murdle has an actual plot. Which is more than many video games manage.\nRead more",

You'd think, then, that a game about a nomadic Iron Age people larking about in a horrible swamp would be made for me, but unfortunately, Gord is somehow both a game where you can feed a child to a forest-dwelling horror, and a game that's kind of dull.\nIt's the only memorable thing that happened, and I did it to save time. The horrors are sort of demi-gods who you occasionally threaten you with plague unless you satisfy some demand. The alternative is to attack them, which the game stresses is extremely dangerous. I might rationalise the choice as the lesser evil, one life sacrificed to spare the lives of several, but the reality is that sending all those dudes back and forth across the map just sounded like too much hassle.\nRead more",

Each realm has a different layout, architecture and ambience, and you'll need to alternate between them to expose routes and bypass obstacles, as indicated by clumps of ashen butterflies, making your way back to Axiom by means of an Effigy of Emergence.\nYou're also dropped into Umbral when you die, which gives you another chance to bump off whatever it is that slew you; die a second time, and you'll have to restart from one of the game's Vestige bonfires. Another thing to worry about: the longer you spend in Umbral, realm of death and despair, the more numerous the monsters that spawn from its shadows. I'm hoping the two-worlds mechanic will mutate the game's many debts to Dark Souls into a brand new playstyle (though as Ed Superior noted in his Lords of the Fallen hands-on, it stands up pretty well as a straight Souls clone). It already poses some fun possibilities for the ever-thorny question of multiplayer.\nRead more",

We're also told about the formation of the Constellation organisation, a group of swashbuckling pioneers who are concerned with the origins of certain mystic Artifacts. And we get to read a little about a few key Starfield characters, such as space cowboy Sam Coe, careworn ex-soldier Sarah Morgan and sciencehunk Barrett.

Named Maverick Games, it’s led by the former director of Forza Horizon 5 - a creative risk-taker named Mike Brown. “Games are made in a very certain way that brings with it real security,” Brown told GamesIndustry.biz in January. “We know that if we do these things in a row, we will hit this date and the game will come out. I think there are other ways where you can still hit that date, but also do a load of new things on the way.”\r\n\n\r\nOne of the new things Maverick is backing is Jamie Brittain, lead writer on the studio’s unannounced open world game. Brittain has never worked on a videogame before. Yet any millennial who grew up in the UK will undoubtedly be familiar with Skins, the epochal teen drama he co-created with his dad, Bryan Elsley.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Game designer, sometime Gears of War frontman and nowadays, comic book author Cliff Bleszinski would very much like Epic to make another Jazz Jackrabbit. In case you're unfamiliar, or disgracefully young, Jazz Jackrabbit was a platform game for MS-DOS, published in 1994 - it was Bleszinski's first project as a designer for then-named Epic MegaGames. He worked on the game alongside coder Arjan Brussee, who would later found Guerrilla Games before moving to Visceral Studios and finally, reuniting with Bleszinski to launch Bosskey Productions, the ill-fated creator of the generally rather decent Lawbreakers. Cor, people don't half move around in this industry.\nI never played Jazz Jackrabbit - if memory serves, the first in the series launched during a particularly cursed/blessed (delete as appropriate) part of my early youth, when my gaming consisted exclusively of shareware titles on Apple Macintosh. But I can certainly get behind Bleszinski's follow-up remark that he'd like a potential Jazz Jackrabbit 3 to be a first-person game in the vein of PS1 classic Jumping Flash.\nRead more",

          "description": "Little-CRPG-that-could Baldur's Gate 3 has solved the Labyrinth, outwitted the Sphinx and ascended to the rank of Metacritic's highest-rated PC game of all time, knocking ZA/UM's Disco Elysium into second place. (OK, so technically they're both on 97, but I'm guessing the \"score distillation\" arithmetic behind-the-scenes puts Baldur's Gate 3 ahead - their positions were reversed last time I checked.) This follows a busy weekend for Larian's new game, which exceeded its own online player activity record on Sunday to the tune of around 875,000 players.\r\n\n\r\nIt's a terrific achievement for one of the richest and most rewarding D&D adaptations ever set to code. It's also only going to encourage those on the interwebs who are using Baldur's Gate 3's success as a stick to beat other developers with. As you've likely discovered for yourself, the new game is the centre of a raging discussion about what we should expect from today's \"triple-A games\", aka \"biggest/shiniest\". Some point to its lack of microtransactions or DRM, while others highlight its relative technical sturdiness and overall \"quality\". A few people go into specifics: I've read a couple of thoughtful comments comparing the bespoke, one-and-done nature of Baldur's Gate 3 quests with open world action titles and other genres that hinge on repeated quest formulas and reward systems.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Its colourful visuals and contrasting colour palette cast its deep caverns and sun-drenched mountains in a beautiful, but eerie kind of light, and its strange, scuttling creatures put me in the mind of the night horrors from Dredge and Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet. But its central premise of you being a headless body carting round an inflatable head to presumably escape to goodness knows where isn't quite the breath of fresh air I hoped it would be. \nRead more",

In a pre-reveal showcase attended by RPS, producer Andreas Schmiedecker walked us through a few sections of this atypically green-fingered open world shooter.\nIn Outcast: ANB you play a growly-gruff ex-Navy SEAL, the sleekly named Cutter Slade, who roves a planet called Adelpha using a fancy jetpack. You're here to help the indigenous Talans - who definitely hail from the Ewoky end of the ethnic representation scale - fight off an army of robot invaders. The jetpack is the initial star attraction: it lets you boost, glide and dash through colourful landscapes inspired by 80s and 90s movies and comics. The associated animations seem a bit wooden to me: I often felt like I was watching somebody steer a man-shaped cursor, rather than a body in flight. But I certainly can't argue with the verticality and agility on display.\nRead more",

One of the requests that has come up with my ongoing testing has been how well the default Microsoft Windows 11 installation compares to loading up Linux on this 8-core AMD Zen 4 laptop. Well, in this article is a look at the Linux performance compared to Windows 11, including when making use of the Linux 6.5 development kernel where AMD P-State is now the default and also for seeing what workloads are impacted by the recent AMD Inception vulnerability.",

          "description": "The dream of owning the first Metal Gear games in one location will soon come to fruition with the Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection. Now, a new platform is getting on on the action. In addition to current-gen consoles and PC, Konami announced plans to bring the first volume of the Metal Gear Solid bundle to PlayStation 4.\nThe PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC versions were previously locked in for October 24. PS4 details are still TBD, however, so we'll have to wait for further info. For now, we know the Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection will be digital-only on PS4. The PS5, Xbox Series, and Switch collections will be available both physically and digitally. \nhttps://twitter.com/metalgear_jp/status/1693518300725366829\nBring back Ultra Games\nAs previously reported, Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection packs in some essential sneaking missions, including the MSX classics. In addition to Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake, players can relive the stealth action of Metal Gear Solid, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty and Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. \nThe NES version of Metal Gear I spent too long attempting to figure out back in the day is there, too, as is the less celebrated followup, Snake's Revenge. Much like the NES Metal Gear, creator Hideo Kojima was not involved in this sequel, and it shows. As a piece of gaming history, though, it's essential. Snake's Revenge reflects a company capitalizing on the popularity of an original title in international regions. Also, like most Ultra Games, the soundtrack — from composer Tsutomu Ogura — rips. \nAs for what lies beyond all this, we'll have to wait and see if those volume 2 leaks pan out whenever Konami gets around to detailing the next collection. \nThe post Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1 adds digital PS4 version appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The recent Quake 2 remaster by Nightdive Studios is arguably the best way to experience the classic 1997 shooter. But could it be better? That's what one modder thinks, who's currently working on a path tracing mod.\nReddit user mStewart207 (as spotted by DSO Gaming) recently uploaded some images from their upcoming \"RTX Renderer\" project, which will aim to implement even greater lighting algorithms to the revamped version of Quake 2.\n[caption id=\"attachment_397928\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\"] Image via mStewart207/Reddit.[/caption]\nJudging by the screenshots so far, it looks pretty great. The modder is aiming to publish it to GitHub \"as soon as it's more or less playable.\" We don't know when that will be, though.\nWhat is path tracing?\nThere are a lot of technical terms that get thrown around in this modern gaming era. From image upscaling to things like RTX and rasterization, it can be difficult to know what's going on when it comes to visual acuity.\nMany of you may already be aware of ray tracing, which is – in a nutshell – a piece of AI that uses the position of the player to make light and shadows look more realistic. But is this any different to path tracing? According to TechSpot, \"Path tracing differs from ray tracing in that instead of following lots of rays, throughout an entire scene, the algorithm only traces the most likely path for the light.\"\nIt's up to you to decide whether you understand that definition or not.\nAt the very least, it sounds like the remaster of Quake 2 could potentially look even better once this mod comes out. Who knew id Software's brown-and-gray FPS would get a second chance in the limelight?\nThe post Quake 2 remaster is now getting a path tracing mod as well appeared first on Destructoid.",

It feels like just yesterday that the disastrous launch took the world by storm, followed by subsequent promises of NPCs and an even bigger focus on microtransactions. But all of that is in the rearview (well, except the microtransactions!), and we're so far removed from that launch mess that it's not even funny. Here's a quick look at what's coming to Season 14.\nHere's the full rundown from Bethesda on what to expect for Season 14\nThe team will continue to drop updates throughout the season, but the big focus right now is on the \"Fight for Freedom\" season pass track, as well as some upcoming quality-of-life enhancements that will be ready out of the gate.\n\"Season 14 features a variety of quality-of-life improvements, including lowered Perk Card requirements, streamlined Workbench changes along with a new free cam feature in Photo Mode. Active Fallout 1st subscribers will also receive bonus rewards as they level up.\"\n\nIt sounds small, but someone out there is likely freaking out (in a good way!) about just one of these enhancements.\nHere are the main features for Season 14:\nNew Ally: Grandma Junko is on a mission to find her grandchildren... she thinks. While her memory isn't what it used to be, she can still cook up a good old-fashioned home-cooked meal for you.\nPresidential Power Armor Skins: Who needs Secret Service when you have Power Armor?\nOval Office: Create your own base of operations with the Oval Office Rug and Wallpaper.\nAutominer Collectron: This new Collectron does all the mining for you, hunting for Ore!\nThe post Fallout 76’s Season 14 update will have more quality of life changes appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Despite numerous controversies over the years, Twitch remains the biggest platform for streaming and broadcasting video game content. However, the Amazon-owned site has recently tried to implement better features to help users moderate their channels, and it looks a new tool is on the way.\nAccording to a screenshot uploaded by streamer and partner Lowco (thanks, Eurogamer), Twitch plans on adding a way for content creators to block banned viewers from watching their streams. The image depicts a new setting that \"when enabled, banned users will not be able to watch your live broadcasts.\"\nhttps://twitter.com/LowcoTV/status/1691893134609813526\nCurrently, a Twitch ban only stops users from chatting, but they can still watch. Note that this new feature is not considered an IP ban, but Twitch's senior product manager Trevor Fisher says the company will look into feedback from streamers with the hope of making moderation tools more powerful.\nWhen are Twitch ban changes coming?\nUpdates to Twitch bans should roll out in September, available to all users interested in the new feature. We don't know what date exactly, but details should trickle in as Twitch implements changes from its Patch Note streams.\nBlocking users from watching streams (and chatting) won't stop them from being able to watch VODs or clips, though. Just as Fisher noted, maybe that's something the platform could implement in the future with enough feedback.\nWith viewership up, amassing around 1.8 billion watched hours for July 2023, Twitch retains its position as the number one place for streaming content. Alternatives like YouTube Gaming are trying to compete, but the purple site in its current iteration still rules the market.

In 2022, it was pushed to this year and then delayed again after missing its June 15 release date.\nhttps://twitter.com/KOOPMode/status/1693691706737103311\nIts August 29 launch date appears to be the one to stick, as KO_OP has announced that the game has gone gold.

The Atari 2600+ will play games from both the 2600 and 7800 consoles.\nThe Atari 2600+ is based on the classic wood-grained, four-switch model of the console, which has become the most recognizable look for it. It comes with a reproduction CX40 controller and supports USB power and HDMI. Also, the Atari logo lights up when it’s on. It comes packed in with a 10-in-1 cartridge that has a selection of classic games.\nhttps://youtu.be/SgAcNwG5vCo\nThe store page also says that it has “been lovingly recreated to the same specifications as the original,” which is kind of vague. I mostly want to know whether the hardware is similar to the original, if it uses FPGA, or if it’s software emulation. It sounds like the latter since it touts a Rockchip 3128 SOC microprocessor. Most games are compatible, as seen in this list. The Atari 2600+’s HDMI is certainly tantalizing since the hardware had previously only supported RF-out. I had actually modified my personal Atari 2600 to support composite out. Modern TVs, even late-era CRTs, tend to hate RF signals.\nI wish more companies would do this. Being a retro gamer progressively requires more soldering skills to maintain and modify consoles to work on modern setups. Would I buy an official NES from Nintendo that supports HDMI? Absolutely yes. On the other hand, would I buy a reproduction Atari Jaguar? Yeah, actually, I totally would.

          "description": "Gamescom 2023 will be kicking off today, and Geoff Keighley is the host. He recently hopped on Twitter to reveal that Zack Snyder will be promoting the upcoming epic space opera, Rebel Moon. The Snyder-directed film will be available on December 22, though that’s not the only thing he’ll be promoting, as Keighley also stated that the director has a “special announcement” in store.\nhttps://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1693659685428117822?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\nWhat Snyder could be planning to announce here is anyone's guess. For instance, he has mentioned that Rebel Moon will be receiving a video game adaptation. Not many details have been revealed, though Snyder has excitedly stated that it is an RPG that is “literally insane and so immersive and so intense and so huge.” It wouldn’t be a surprise to discover that his announcement involves the upcoming Rebel Moon game.\n[caption id=\"attachment_397886\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Gamescom.[/caption]\nGamescom 2023 is finally upon us\nGamescom begins with Opening Night Live today at 11 AM PDT. You can watch it on YouTube and Twitter, and if you tune in half an hour earlier, you’ll catch the pre-show. A few games have already been confirmed to make an appearance, including:\nAlan Wake 2 \nAssassin’s Creed Mirage\nLords of the Fallen\nMortal Kombat 1\nSonic Superstars\nThe trade fair will run until August 27. Planned events include Awesome Indies which, as you might guess, will showcase the latest and upcoming indie games. You can also expect the Future Games Show on August 23, and Level Infinite’s Into the Infinite event on the same day.\nThe post Zack Snyder to make a “special announcement” at Gamescom 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Sometimes it's hard to imagine that No Man's Sky came out seven years ago! What was once the most controversial game in recent history (with accusations of false advertising thrown about) is easily now one of the best sci-fi games of the previous (or even current) generation. And now even more content is on the way.\nA recent video from the guys at Hello Games acknowledges the time that has passed with a special anniversary video. It showcases all the major changes and free DLC that have been implemented over the past seven years.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mj_TLfNmSQY\nThen, right at the end, a brief announcement that \"ECHOES\" is on the way. We don't know what this is, other than it being some new No Man's Sky content.\nSean Murray teases Twitter once more\nTypically, when it comes to updates for the procedurally generated universe simulator, the studio's own Sean Murray will tease what's coming next.\nThis one is no different, but a tweet from the man himself doesn't really clue us in. With previous updates, Murray will often upload a single emoji to his Twitter account, often alluding to what fans can expect next.\nHowever, with \"ECHOES,\" all we get is some question marks, which really only adds to the mystery. Suffice it to say, fans will be excited to see what No Man's Sky has in store.\nhttps://twitter.com/NoMansSky/status/1692521575730274375\nAccording to the game's Wiki page, there have been 24 updates since it launched in 2016. All of which have been free. The studio may have started out on the wrong foot but NMS now has a strong following. We don't yet know when the next major patch is coming out, but it shows just how committed the team has been in making sure this mind-bogglingly large game just gets bigger and bigger.\nThe post No Man’s Sky Turns 7, ECHOES content teased appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It seems like Fall Guys has been making the rounds lately. I mean, sure, the game has kind of been everywhere since it launched back in 2020. But its collaboration momentum certainly shows no signs of slowing down. So hot on the heels of Fall Guys coming to Final Fantasy XIV, we have official confirmation that the upcoming Super Bomberman R 2 will dip its hands into the Fall Guys pot as well.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0Xm66vWDNE\nThese two franchises have certainly enjoyed a good relationship up to this point. After all, Super Bomberman R Online had already crossed over with Fall Guys in 2021. What makes this one a bit interesting, though, is that Super Bomberman R 2 will have the… guy from Fall Guys shortly after launch. It’ll arrive on September 14, to be specific. Called the “Bean Bomber” here, you’ll be able to unlock the little fellow from the title’s in-game store.\nThe Bean will join a few other cameo characters that were previously pointed out by Destructoid’s own Zoey “corn chips are no place for a mighty warrior” Handley. These include the likes of Dracula and Princess Tomato, making Super Bomberman R 2 something of a crossover fest. Considering it’s hard to tell when and if we’ll ever see a lot of these classic Konami characters, I'll welcome these small cameos when I can.\nSuper Bomberman R 2 will launch on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC on September 13. Those with physical copies can play the game a day earlier on September 12.\nThe post Super Bomberman R 2 will feature a Fall Guys crossover at launch appeared first on Destructoid.",

I was six at the time, but it was impossible to avoid the media fervor around its ultra-violence. My parents didn’t bat an eye when I rented it. My mother’s reaction to seeing me play it was to just ask if it was that game everyone was talking about. Then she continued with her day.\nThat would normally be an extremely weak way to start talking about Mortal Kombat 1. The original Mortal Kombat (which we can no longer refer to as Mortal Kombat 1) was 11 Mortal Kombats ago.\nYet Mortal Kombat 1 seems somewhat keen to tap into nostalgia for the ‘90s, and there’s nothing I have more abundance of than ‘90s nostalgia.

          "description": "We got word of a sequel to cyberpunk hack-and-slasher Ghostrunner back in May 2021, and now we have a date. 505 Games set Ghostrunner 2 up as another drop in a jam-packed bucket on October 26, 2023. \nAlong with the news came a new trailer for the first-person followup, which continues the story of Jack, a veritable cyber ninja who was thought to be one of the last active Ghostrunners. The new gamescom story trailer dips its toes into what's new this time around. This includes a quick look at the absurdly fast motorcyle and some of the vehicular combat that comes along with it. There's also a nasty AI cult to contend with, which doesn't sound too divorced from reality.\nGhostrunner 2 features a totally revamped progression system, with new abilities and paths available. According to 505, the sequel hopes to be more approachable to both new and experienced players alike. There's also a new block and perfect parry system, for those who pride themselves on their flashy CQC skills. It sounds like there's more freedom in the encounters and exploration, too, particularly when it comes to taking on bosses.  \n[caption id=\"attachment_397767\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1200\"] Screenshot via 505 Games[/caption]\nRev 'em up\nThose looking to pick up Ghostrunner 2 when it launches can dig through a few pre-order options. The $39.99 Base Edition is both physical and digital, and the $49.99 Deluxe Edition and $69.99 Brutal Edition are digital. Picking up the Brutal Edition grants access to the sequel two days early on October 24. There's also a Season Pass with a new mode and four asset packs, a bonus animated skin and a motorcycle skin. If there's a way to make my motorcycle look as ridiculous as possible, count me in. \nGhostrunner 2 will dash to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and PC when it launches on October 26.\nThe post Ghostrunner 2 battles AI cults, ramps up vehicular combat on October 26 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Nintendo has announced that the longtime voice actor of many iconic Mario characters is stepping back from the role. In a Tweet today, they made the announcement that Charles Martinet is instead moving into the role of “Mario Ambassador.”\nCharles Martinet has been in the role of Mario since 1994’s CD-ROM version of Mario Teaches Typing. Beyond the red-shirted plumber, he also went on to voice just about every other male character in the Mushroom Kingdom, including Luigi, Wario, and Waluigi. However, the recent Super Mario Bros. Movie cast Chris Pratt in the role, and trailers for Super Mario Wonder had many people questioning if Martinet had been replaced. That’s still kind of up in the air.\nhttps://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1693624002982314108?s=20\nThe post made by Nintendo doesn’t address the reasons for Martinet stepping back. However, it says that he will continue to travel to promote the character. They plan to follow up with a video featuring Charles Martinet and Shigeru Miyamoto, which will hopefully provide more information.\nIt’s a bit of a curious thing. Mario hasn’t been the most vocal character, so it shouldn't be that jarring to have another actor in the role. However, Martinet has been almost inseparable from the character for a long while now and had previously stated in 2021, “I want to voice Mario until I drop dead.” Really, I’m just hoping that agreeable circumstances led to him leaving the role.\nI also hope Nintendo isn’t planning on taking Mario games into a more dialogue-reliant direction, but that’s a personal preference.\nNintendo did not state if Martinet will still be playing his roles in upcoming games, such as the Super Mario RPG remake or Super Mario Bros. Wonder. More information is forthcoming.\nThe post Charles Martinet is stepping down as voice of Mario appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Resident Evil 4 received a remake in March 2023 which brought Leon’s classic adventure to modern consoles. As was the case with Resident Evil 7 and Village, Capcom has promised a VR mode for the remake. We’ll get to see a little more of the VR mode at the upcoming Tokyo Game Show, which kicks off on September 21 and runs until September 24.\nResident Evil 4 isn’t the only Capcom game that’ll be making an appearance. The company also lists Street Fighter 6, Exoprimal, Monster Hunter Now, and the Ace Attorney trilogy on its official webpage outlining its Tokyo Game Show plans.\n[caption id=\"attachment_397688\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot by Destructoid.[/caption]\nCapcom has big plans for the Tokyo Game Show 2023\nCapcom will have its own booth at the Tokyo Game Show where attendees will have the chance to try out some of the company’s latest games. The event will also feature the return of the Resident Evil airsoft shooting range in collaboration with Tokyo Marui. For those who can’t make it, there’ll be a prerecorded stream which’ll share some of Capcom’s biggest news. It airs on September 21 at 07:00 AM PDT.\nWe received our first teaser for Resident Evil 4’s VR mode during the May PlayStation showcase, though not much was revealed. We'll hopefully see a few more details this time around, including whether game modes outside of the main campaign will also receive the VR treatment.\nThe company will have to put on a good show if it hopes to stand out, as several other gaming giants have confirmed that they’ll be showing up, including Bandai Namco and Square Enix. Sony will also be there, though they’ll only be exhibiting indie titles.\nThe post Resident Evil 4 VR mode scheduled to appear at Tokyo Game Show 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Bethesda's Starfield is one of the most hotly anticipated titles of 2023, which is a heck of an achievement for a year that's already played host to heavy hitters like Hogwarts Legacy, Resident Evil 4, and Diablo 4, to list a few. It's easy to see the appeal, too, as the game's been described as \"Skyrim in space\" by Todd Howard himself. It's a given, of course, that not everyone will find themselves enjoying what appears to be a classic Bethesda Game Studios RPG, but some may have taken their biases a tad too far.\nIn fact, some early critique coming from a particular game developer has drawn the ire of Bethesda Game Studios' own Head of Publishing, Pete Hines.

          "description": "Gran Turismo is a Neill Blomkamp-directed film based on the popular PlayStation franchise. It tells the tracks the tale of how Jann Mardenborough turned his love of Gran Turismo games into a fully-fledged motorsport career. Though the wide release for the USA is set for August 25, the film has aired in international markets, reception has been good thus far, and it has been reported that the film has already grossed $22.7 million.\n[caption id=\"attachment_395283\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Polyphony Digital.[/caption]\nGran Turismo racing to theatres\nThe Gran Turismo movie is a star-studded affair featuring Archie Madekwe as Mardenborough, Djimon Hounsou as Mardenborough’s father, and Orlando Bloom as Nissan marketing executive Danny Moore. As Blomkamp has explained, to capture the most cinematic shots, filmographers used FPV drones to carry IMAX sensor-approved cameras. Several cockpit shots were used which will be familiar to franchise fans.\nhttps://twitter.com/BORReport/status/1693278878792642768\nCritical reception to the Gran Turismo movie has been positive overall, which reviewers complimenting the film’s authenticity and sincerity. It has not managed to avoid all criticism, and there has been some controversy regarding the film's depiction of Mardenborough’s Nürburgring crash which led to the death of a spectator. Some have described it as insensitive, with Polygon calling it “a tasteless reframing of a fatal event.”\nGran Turismo’s road to theatres has featured a few obstacles. Most notably, it has had to contend with the SAG-AFTRA strike which has affected all of Hollywood. As a result, the movie had its August 11 release date delayed in the USA.\nThe Gran Turismo movie is but one of several video game adaptations Sony has in store. A Ghost of Tsushima movie is in the works, and fans can also look forward to television adaptations of the Horizon and God of War franchises.\nThe post Gran Turismo movie has grossed an estimated $22.7 million appeared first on Destructoid.",

Mostly we missed out on games like Famicom Detective Club and Fire Emblem, both titles that eventually received translations and re-releases. Mainly, the number of unlocalized titles bloated out in the early 3D era, then retracted again once we hit HD and the world became better connected through the internet.\nHowever, there are still a number of titles that Nintendo has yet to localize, and I would like to bring them to your attention.

It sports a variety of locations where everything is fully destructible. Playable characters can take on dozens of classes, such as cops, farmers, hackers, and even a gorilla, in a quest to overthrow a corrupt mayor and take control of the zany world.\nHow you go about doing that is up to you, as the game promotes creative, open-ended gameplay with a multitude of possible methods and solutions to your quest. Whether that involves using a variety of bizarre weapons, getting behind the wheel of different vehicles, or simply building a dream home to farm and relax, the answer to \"What can you do in this game?\" appears to be \"Yes.\" \n\n\nThe game supports co-op (both local and online), features a ton of side quests, and characters controlled by what a press release describes as “advanced A.I.” Streets of Rogue 2 looks even more nuts than the first game based on the reveal trailer, and we look forward to seeing how it shapes up with it launches on Steam Early Access next year.",

It was set to launch in Steam Early Access later this year, but the team needs more time to bring it together.\nAs such, the game will now launch early next year. A developer video simply informs fans of the team’s desire to spend more time with Hyper Light Breaker, with creative director Alx Preston stating in a press release, \n“We've made remarkable progress and the game has come a long way since we started development. Taking this additional time to focus on Hyper Light Breaker’s development will allow us to bring the game to its full potential and we are incredibly grateful for the support from our community that’s been with us every step of the way. We thank you for your patience and understanding as we work to deliver a new adventure that lives up to what fans expect from a Heart Machine title.”\n\n\nHyper Light Breaker is a spiritual follow-up to Hyper Light Drifter, set within the same universe but imagined in 3D graphics. The third-person action game can be played alone or with friends in 3-player online co-op.

The popular console was pretty much the poster child for ‘late 70s/early ‘80s gaming, boasting a vast library of titles that have since inspired a multitude of games for decades to come. Over 30 years after the 2600 was discontinued, it’s making a contemporary comeback. \nAtari and Plaion have announced the 2600+, a modernized recreation of the four-switch model introduced in 1980. In addition to sharing the same woodgrain aesthetics and metal switches, it also includes modern features such as HDMI output, USB port, and support for multiple screen resolutions. The console comes with a new CX40+ joystick faithful to the original and supports two players. \n\n\nThe 2600+ includes the single cartridge slot and can play original 2600 and 7800 cartridges (including physical versions of newly released titles, such as Mr. Run and Jump and Bezerker Enhanced Edition). Additionally, the console comes bundled with a 10-in-1 cartridge with the following games:\nAdventure\nCombat\nDodge ‘Em\nHaunted House\nMaze Craze\nMissle Command\nRealsports Volleyball\nSurround\nVideo Pinball\nYar’s Revenge\n“We’re excited to be working with Atari to bring back the Atari 2600 and help meet the growing consumer demand for retro hardware,” said commercial director of retro at Plaion, Ben Jones in a press release. “For gamers who remember the thrill of playing arcade games at home for the very first time, the Atari 2600+ will bring you right back. For everyone else, the offer is one of timeless fun and the chance to experience a golden age of video games in a way that could only come from Atari.”\nThe Atari 2600+ launches on November 17 for $129.99. You can pre-order it now on Atari’s website. CX40 joysticks will also be sold separately for $24.99. Atari and Plaion also plan to launch the CX-30 Paddle Controller bundle that includes the paddle and a 4-in-1 game cartridge for $39.99.",

Instead of sliding covers off like with the PS5, Xbox’s solution is to wrap the cosmetic change around the console, hence the name. The company has revealed three wraps to kick off the product, including a special edition Starfield wrap. \n“The Starfield-inspired console wrap reimagines your console as an on-board avionics module, powering you through your adventures,” an Xbox blog post reads. “Key internal console components are highlighted through outlined access panel and game-inspired graphics.

Starward Industries has released a new trailer highlighting this release date as well as new footage of the game, and you can watch it below: \n\n\nIn The Invincible, players control Yasna, an astrobiologist in search of her lost crew that she must bring back dead or alive. They’re lost somewhere on the Mars-like planet of Regis III.\n“On the surface, it may seem that Regis III is uninhabited but that doesn’t mean the people who visit here can feel like unopposed rulers,” a press release reads.\nStarward Industries says the philosophical nature of what happens to Yasna on Regis III will have her forever questioning “the scale of humankind’s ambitions.” \n\nThe Invincible is based on Stanislaw Lem’s novel of the same name, which mixes “retro-futuristic and atompunk design and aesthetics” to create a poppy art style. We’ve experienced a decent chunk of the game already, and you can read our preview thoughts of The Invincible right here. \nThe Invincible hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on November 6. \nAre you going to check out The Invincible later this year?

Today, an announcement on Xbox Wire revealed that the Xbox 360 store will be shutting down on July 29, 2024. This means you will no longer be able to purchase games or DLC on the console, and the Microsoft Movies & TV app will stop working altogether.\nHowever, the post makes it clear that content bought beforehand will still be playable after the cutoff date, so digital games on the 360 should still work just fine, and you'll always be able to re-download them. Games with online multiplayer features will also still be functional, though that exists on more of a game-by-game basis. For example, the servers of many Halo games have already been shut down. And while the Microsoft Movies & TV app will no longer work on the 360, your content there transfers to anywhere else you have the app.\nAdditionally, backwards compatible 360 games will still be available to purchase and play on the Xbox One and Series X/S. While this doesn't encompass every game on the 360 store, it does cover most of the platform's most popular titles. Xbox linked its full list of backwards compatible games in today's announcement post. Here's the most recent batch from November 2021:\nFor more Xbox 360 nostalgia, you can revisit our top 25 Xbox 360 games of all time.\nAre there any Xbox 360 games you'll be rushing to grab before the store closes?

Wonder, which both launch on October 20. The new date now puts it a full week outside of that blast radius, providing some breathing room for players looking to enjoy some or all of those titles around launch. \nAlan Wake 2 unfolds 13 years after the original game and stars two protagonists: the titular author and FBI agent Saga Anderson. Saga is investigating a murder case in the Pacific Northwest, while Alan has been trapped in the nightmarish realm of The Dark Place since the first game's conclusion. Players switch between both characters and can play as much or as little of their stories as they see fit. Remedy has stated that the sequel is a pure survival horror title this time around. To learn more about the game, check out our preview of co-protagonist Saga Anderson’s gameplay chapter from Summer Game Fest. \nAlan Wake 2 will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via the Epic Games Store.",

          "description": "When The Messenger was released in 2018, Thierry Boulanger went into its launch with reasonable expectations. He was proud of the game he and the team at Sabotage had made, but he was prepared to consider it a success even if it didn’t sell well. “If 100 People bought it, I would have been like, ‘Oh my God, we hit three digits. So, for sure, there’s at least one person I don’t know that bought it,’” Boulanger says. The Messenger sold far more than 100 copies and even took home The Game Awards’ Best Debut Indie award alongside many other accolades. With its unique approach to platforming and a fun story twist that allowed it to exist as both an NES and SNES throwback, The Messenger was a hit and quickly allowed Boulanger and Sabotage to pursue its dream project: A large-scale RPG unabashedly inspired by 16-bit greats like Chrono Trigger, Super Mario RPG, and many more. “It’s been seven years, and it’s still kind of a dream,” Boulanger says. Read more...",

          "description": "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge's big DLC Dimension Shellshock finally has a release date, as well as another new playable character. \nThe expansion arrives on August 31 for $7.99, and a new trailer reveals that fan-favorite character Karai is joining the fun. Karai is a high-ranking member of the Foot Clan that made her TMNT comics debut in 1992 and has appeared in several animated adaptions. She’s usually depicted as Shredder’s second-in-command but has also been portrayed as his adopted daughter, depending on your choice of Turtles’ lore (perhaps most famously in the 2003 animated series). Despite her allegiance to the Foot, Karai has often been an uneasy ally to the Turtles in the face of mutual threats.\n\n\nDimension Shellshock also features Usagi Yojimbo as the other new playable fighter and will include a new survival mode. Today’s trailer shows off some of the new filters, including a neat black-and-white comic-panel style presentation inspired by the original TMNT books. The DLC also features new music from composer Tee Lopes and alternative color schemes for each character. \nTo learn more about why we think TMNT: Shredder's Revenge is the best Turtles game in decades, read our review here.",

While the results have been hit or miss over the last few years, EA Sports aims to deliver myriad updates to NHL 24 to make it feel more authentic to the real-life game of hockey than ever before.\nIt all revolves around the Exhaust Engine, which is a system that dictates player performance based on stamina while rewarding players for attacking on offense. The new Goalie Fatigue system ensures the goalie isn't as effective on the first shot of a power play as he is on follow-up shots.

Today, Keighley revealed that the long-quiet Crimson Desert will make its presence known in the form of new gameplay footage.\nCrimson Desert was first revealed at The Game Awards in 2020 and comes from Pearl Abyss, the studio behind the popular MMO Black Desert Online. Crimson Desert is a single-player open-world RPG set in the gritty medieval fantasy world of Pywel. This biodiverse continent is inhabited by humans, fantastical races, and mystical beasts and centers on Macduff, a mercenary who assembles a band of comrades to survive an ensuing power struggle of numerous factions vying to take control of the continent. \nNext Tuesday, join us at @gamescom Opening Night Live, to see a brand new look at the gameplay of CRIMSON DESERT (@CrimsonDesert_) from Pearl Abyss.\nhttps://t.co/AFycLZG9XF pic.twitter.com/mEj030uEQN\nAugust 16, 2023\nThe game's presentation and tone have Western fantasy vibes reminiscent of series such as Game of Thrones. Combat consists of fast-paced melee combat (both unarmed and with various weapons) and flashy magic abilities. If you haven’t seen Crimson Desert in action, check out this gameplay overview released around the game’s announcement.\n\n\nCrimson Desert doesn't have a release date, but Pearl Abyss CEO Jin-Young Heo stated earlier this year that the game was targeting a fall 2023 release window. We'll likely find out of that's still the case when Opening Night Live airs on August 22 at 11 a.m. Pacific/2 p.m. Eastern.",

However, that wait has been shortened just a little; today, Ubisoft revealed that the game has gone gold, and since they're done ahead of schedule, it will now come out on October 5th, a week earlier than previously announced.\nAssassin's Creed Mirage has gone gold and is coming out a week early! 📀\n#AssassinsCreed pic.twitter.com/eWAZttvjIX\nAugust 14, 2023\nThe game follows Basim Ibn Ishaq, an Assassin previously introduced as a supporting character in 2020's Assassin's Creed Valhalla. While the series was traditionally about stealth-focused combat in dense cities, more recent entries have put the player into more open-world environments and incorporated RPG mechanics. Mirage is a return to that classic formula of old, complete with the iconic white hood, hidden blade, and parkour. Set in Baghdad, the game takes place 12 years before the events in Valhalla.\nIn an era where it feels like games are constantly being delayed, it's a nice change of pace when a game is moved up instead. Recently, Baldur's Gate 3 moved its PC release up to avoid competing with \"other RPGs,\" which most likely refers to Starfield. Mirage's new date doesn't seem to be motivated by the desire to avoid competition, but it does pull it a little ahead of the other huge games releasing in October, specifically Marvel's Spider-Man 2 and Super Mario Bros. Wonder, which both come out on October 20.\nHow do you feel about developers advancing their release dates? Let us know in the comments!",

          "description": "Earlier this year, Paramount teased that a video game based on the popular Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles graphic novel, The Last Ronin, was in development. While we haven't heard much since then, today's THQ Nordic Digital Showcase gave us a teaser trailer. Unfortunately, we did not get any looks at gameplay or additional information.\nIn the Last Ronin graphic novel storyline, the final surviving member of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is on a quest for revenge in a ruined New York City. Both the trailer and the new synopsis point toward this being the case for the game as well. \"Who is the Last Ronin? In a future, battle-ravaged New York City, a lone surviving Turtle embarks on a seemingly hopeless mission seeking justice for the family he lost. From the minds of the creators of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and based on the best-selling comic book event by Eastman, Waltz, Bishop, Delgado, and the Escorza Brothers: the official video game adaptation of TMNT: The Last Ronin.\"\n\n\nAccording to senior vice president for games and emerging media at Paramount Global in his interview with Polygon back in March, TMNT: The Last Ronin will be a single-player action RPG similar to the modern God of War series. The title will feature a mature tone, which should be exciting for fans of the comic series, but Rosen made it clear back in March that the game was years away from release.\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Last Ronin doesn't currently have a release window, but is currently slated to come to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. For more on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in gaming, be sure to check out our review of TMNT: Shredder's Revenge and our in-depth impressions of TMNT: The Cowabunga Collection.",

The game was first announced in February 2021. \nEver Crisis hits iOS and Android on September 7. The game is a free-to-play single-player chapter-structured RPG that spans the entire FFVII timeline. Expect to relieve key elements of the original 1997 game plus new story elements written by FF VII Remake story and scenario writer Kazushige Nojima that center on a young Sephiroth. Gameplay includes active-time battles, and monetization takes the form of microtransactions for certain weapons and equipment. See it in action in the latest trailer from Summer Game Fest in June.\n\n\nThis will be the latest stab at bringing FFVII content to mobile. In January, Square Enix shut down Final Fantasy VII The First Soldier, its mobile battle royale that was revealed alongside Ever Crisis two years ago. Hopefully, Ever Crisis has a better run and offers a solid appetizer until Final Fantasy VII Rebirth launches next year.",

In Destiny 2, Reddick played Commander Zavala – an important recurring character in Destiny lore. Reddick was also an outspoken fan of the game that engaged with the community often, so recasting his role was always going to be a difficult task.\nToday, Bungie announced that legendary actor Keith David would be taking over the role. David is an accomplished film and television actor appearing in movies like The Thing and TV shows like Community (pictured below).\nHe has also voiced a number of characters in animated films and video games. He played Dr. Facilier in The Princess and the Frog and he played Keith David in Saint's Row IV. Perhaps his most famous video game role, however, is that of The Arbiter in Halo games. David is no stranger to working with Bungie.\nIn the post on Bungie's site announcing the casting, David said, \"I am honored to continue the great work of Lance Reddick as Zavala. Lance captured the character's sense of integrity so wonderfully. It is my intention to continue that work.\"",

          "description": "If you were looking forward to playing the pro-wrestling-themed RPG WrestleQuest today for its launch, it looks like that card was subject to change. The game has suffered a last-minute delay and will now arrive on August 22.\nDeveloper Mega Cat Studios and publisher Skybound Games announced the delay yesterday evening, explaining the cause was due to the discovery of a save glitch. The statement reads,\n“When performing final checks on one of our launch platforms, we discovered it was possible for players to lose their save game progress when playing WrestleQuest on multiple different devices. Because this is a game filled with hours of content and player progress is so important, we could never bodyslam our fans like that.”\nWhile it’s a bummer to see the game get pushed back mere hours before launch, it’s a good thing the team caught this issue before it could affect players. Curious wrestling and RPG fans will have to wait another couple of weeks, but at least they'll presumably be able to play with some peace of mind. \nWrestleQuest unfolds in a world molded after action figure wrestling leagues with protagonist Randy “Muchacho Man” Santos on a quest to become the ultimate superstar. Inspired by classics like Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy VI, you’ll partner with a large cast of fellow grapplers to unleash special attacks and tag team moves on your opponents. In addition to fictional personalities, several real-life stars appear in the game, including Jeff Jarrett, Jake “The Snake” Roberts, Sgt. Slaughter, among others.\nWresleQuest will be available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, PC, and on mobile via Netflix.",

Best of all, you can add one of the most coveted Pokémon from Gen I, Mew, to your party for free right now. Then, you can gear up to challenge the powerful Mewtwo during the aptly named Get Mew And Mewtwo event.\nBeginning now, you can receive Mew as a Mystery Gift in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. To do this, simply go to the Mystery Gift in-game menu while connected to the internet and enter the password \"GETYOURMEW\" before September 18. Each Mew's Tera Type, nature, and moves will be different to reflect the Mythical Pokémon's flexible capabilities. You'll be able to add Mew to your party and continue your adventures around the Paldea region, but you can also participate in the second portion of this event.\nThe second phase of this event kicks off September 1, with Mewtwo appearing in special Tera Raid battles. If you're able to defeat Mewtwo in these Tera Raid battles, you'll be rewarded with the opportunity to catch a Mewtwo with the Mightiest Mark, meaning these will be seven-star Tera Raid battles. The Pokémon Company also teases that if you challenge Mewtwo with Mew, you can expect \"something special.\"\nPokémon Scarlet and Violet will also play host to several other Tera Raid battle events during this time. Wave 1 runs from today until August 17, Wave 2 runs from August 18 until August 31, and then Mewtwo finally arrives from September 1 to September 17.\n\n\nDuring the same Pokémon Presents livestream, we also learned a lot about the upcoming Pokémon Scarlet and Violet expansions.

          "description": "Two classic Pokémon games are coming to Nintendo Switch Online today in the form of Pokémon Trading Card Game and Pokémon Stadium 2. Both will be available later today.\nPokémon Trading Card Game was released for the GameBoy in 1998 and has a similar format to the traditional RPG series, except you're battling with cards instead of actual monsters. Pokémon Stadium 2 arrived in the U.S. for the Nintendo 64 in 2001 and is, obviously, the sequel to the first Stadium, which is already available on Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack. \nWhile these aren't the much-requested Red/Blue/Yellow games (or any RPG, for that matter), this is a step in the right direction. Be sure to check out our complete list of every game available on Nintendo Switch Online to keep up with each addition.",

Activision confirmed today’s reveal last week after the game leaked online.\nThe teaser doesn’t provide much to go on except the release date; platforms are unannounced, but we imagine it'll be on the usual suspects. Sledgehammer Games is taking the reins, making it the first Modern Warfare title not made by Infinity Ward (but it's still assisting, as all Call of Duty studios tend to). Sledgehammer's last entry was 2021’s Call of Duty: Vanguard, and it also developed WWII and Advanced Warfare. \n\n\nIn the meantime, be sure to check out our Modern Warfare II review and read how that game and Warzone will continue to get content updates in the form of new celebrity operators such as Snoop Dogg and Nicki Minaj. You can also read about how Sony signed a deal with Microsoft to keep the franchise on PlayStation for the next decade as part of the ongoing Microsoft/Activision acquisition.",

During EVO this weekend, the company revealed the game’s title is Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves, alongside a new teaser trailer.\nThe video shows off some brief in-game footage of staples Terry Bogard and Rock Howard in action. Unfortunately, we don’t see much more than that, and SNK has only promised to share more information at a later date. \n\n\nThe last Fatal Fury game was 1999’s Garou: Mark of the Wolves, so a new entry has been a long time coming for fans. Hopefully, it arrives sooner than later and is another big fighting game to anticipate during a relative boom period for the genre thanks to Street Fighter 6 and the upcoming Mortal Kombat 1 and Tekken 8.

          "description": "A little while has passed since the release of 2.7.0, and we are now excited to present you with the bugfix release 2.7.1.\nWe have included a significant amount of fixes and small improvements, in particular:\nAdded ScummVM Log file viewer, so you can easily report the problems on platforms with limited file access, e.g. Android, iOS or even modern Windows.\nFixed the shader-based scaler loading on some platforms.\nAdded multiple improvements to AGI, AGS, Cryomni3D and 12 more engines.\nWe also improved the detection of Broken Sword 1 & Broken Sword 2, so more original versions get properly detected. Thank you to those who submitted bug reports about this, and if you still locate a version that is not recognised, please report it to us (beware that the frankenstein versions that are floating around the internet will not be accepted, only those copied from the original media).\nFor the full and comprehensive list of notable changes, please refer to the Release Notes.\nIf you are as excited about the release as we are, you can share our joy by downloading it from our downloads page. If you are using Windows, macOS, or either of the Ubuntu Snap or Flatpack packages, the autoupdater will pick up the ScummVM 2.7.1 release automatically. For our Android app users, the update will be available on the Play Store.\nThank you very much for your continued support. Enjoy!\n>",
