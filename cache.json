As a studio, Thunderful have a reputation for hopping from one style of game to the next, boiling entire genres down to their essence, and reconstituting them with competence and style to exist within a now-familiar steampunk world of colourful pals and Saturday morning cartoon jokes. The studio is a perpetual notion machine. Yes, with SteamWorld Heist 2, they're revisiting the sci-fi bullet-bouncing of their 2016 tactics game SteamWorld Heist, but they're also introducing significant changes to create a compulsive XCOM-like full of sea-faring submariners that may be their best work yet, even against a back catalogue of blinders. \nRead more",

          "description": "I've never really understood the charm of ultrawide monitors. I dare boldly to maintain that there is such a thing as Too Wide, a point beyond which the extra visual estate becomes a waste of electricity, unless you watch the screen in pairs. I can only assume people who use ultrawide monitors live in constant terror of flanking manoeuvres and demand the maximum amount of peripheral vision. Mind you, I tend to play games with my nose about 10 centimetres from the screen. Forget being flanked - it's the prospect of snipers up ahead I'm worried about.\nIf you're among the people who fret excessively about flankers, I've got great news from Uncle BioWare. Forthcoming RPG Dragon Age: The Veilguard will support 21:9 ultrawide monitors. The ultrawide functionality extends to cinematics - you can disable \"cinematic aspect ratios\" to switch off the black bars that otherwise hem in the view. It's one of several PC-specific flourishes they've just blogged about. Have a look.\n Read more",

Unfortunately for James, he accidentally walked straight into Gamescom. “I’m starting to think that there are a lot of video games” he informed us yesterday. Horrifying if true. Still, it does sound like he’s managing to have some fun there, mainly by hitting up Saber Interactive COO and former id Software co-owner Tim Willits for some top tips on how to avenge Edwin’s thieving ways.\nTips about kill-stealing aside, James found time to ask Willits about Space Marine 2's microtransactions, and whether there was any nervousness returning to a cult hit series… especially one a lot of people had almost given up on ever seeing again. “Even the “push forward” combat of the original was part of [id’s] inspiration when we created Doom 2016,” answered Willits. “So for me personally, it’s this huge circle. It’s always intimidating working on a franchise that people love.” But, with the right team, technology, and vision he says, “it just comes together.”\nRead more",

So I was intrigued to give the alpha version of Splitgate 2 a go and see if it had a little more substance to it than its initial reveal, which gave off a, \"it's Splitgate but with more money\" feel. \nWell, I think it's… a bit serious? It certainly has more polish and some extra additions, yet I didn't come away from it thrilled by its more competitive, class-based FPS leanings.

I’m only tangentially familiar with the Dying Light games, but I was under the impression that the model here was releasing a single game, then updating and expanding it for years. Whether standalone adventure Dying Light: The Beast represents an attempt to course correct after Dying Light 2’s mixed reception, then, I’m not entirely sure. But if nothing else, it does share something in common with all the other adverts at Gamescom tonight: it is a game that exists, and will presumably be playable at some point.\n \nRead more",

Developed well over two decades ago, the original Silent Hill 2 is the magnum opus of Polish horror stalwarts Bloober Team. Running on then-innovative \"Unreal Engine 5\" technology created by Jazz Jackrabbit publishers Epic MegaGames, it's a wonderful abyss of a game that remains perfectly playable today, given a certain amount of tolerance for the quirks of the era.\nIt begins with your character, James Sunderland, descending from the road towards the eponymous Midwestern nowhere-town. Like many games of the period, Silent Hill 2 uses a third-person, over-the-shoulder manual camera, which allows you to glance fearfully up at the monstrous pine trees that fringe the path - each rising from a bulging tide of fog that menaces with the suggestion of approaching figures. There is moisture everywhere, gushing from drain pipes and dribbling down concrete barriers. As you amble into the murk, deathly chords and groaning, unmechanical motifs reverberate from somewhere deep underground. \r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Last week, the Xitter account for H2M - a mod aiming to recreate the heyday of classic Modern Warfare 2 multiplayer inside Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered - announced that they had received a cease and desist from Activision Blizzard, and would shut down the project. The 2022 version of Modern Warfare 2 lacked the original’s multiplayer, and H2M was so highly-anticipated that Steam sales of the 2016 FPS balooned in the lead-up to the mod’s planned release date. It didn't hurt that Activision had it on sale, of course, but the timing lined up so well that some fans speculated the discount was a deliberate bait-and-switch on the publisher’s part to profit from excitement over a mod they were already planning to shut down.\nRead more",

Silent Hill 2 is the more feted of the Hills - if I were a calculating franchise custodian tasked with 'bringing back' one of the acclaimed original trilogy, that's probably the instalment I and my spreadsheets would fix upon. I mean, it's the game with Pyramid Head in it - the nearest thing Silent Hill has to a mascot, and it's not like there's an issue of cutting out plot material: each game in the Silent Hill series is, on some level, a distinct story with a distinct protagonist.\nStill, the decision to 'skip' the first game in the series, whose world, narrative themes, music and art direction set the parameters for all the rest, made my brain itch a bit, and when I ran into Bloober's creative director Mateusz Lenart and lead producer Maciej Głomb at a Konami event, I had to ask about it. \r\n \nRead more",

What a perfect time, then, to dive into the alpha demo for vampire management game Blood Bar Tycoon, especially since Two Point seem to be resting on their laurels a bit too comfortably for my liking.\nThe idea here is you build a swanky bar serving claret cosmopolitans, ichor-ish coffees and uh, viscera vampiros to your undead clientele. But (with the sorta exception of the crimson-sapped Dracaena cinnabari) blood doesn’t grow on trees, so you’ll also be moonlighting as a human-nabber. You’ll research a slew of “whacky contraptions” to extract their blood, which I greatly enjoy, because “zany exsanguination” is a real winner of a feature.

If you never watched the Adam and Joe show, they used to do home movie recreations of famous films like Titanic and Saving Private Ryan using stuffed animals and action figures. I found these \"Toymovies\" hysterical as a kid - I suspect they are less so now. Probably, they are full of jokes we might tentatively class as \"of their time\". The point is, Reptilian Rising is sort of Toymovie: The Game. \n Read more",

It's 2D pixel art, with a limited colour palette as in EGA games, and you control it with a text parser, like King's Quest or one of them other Sierra adventures old men like Graham remember. It's important to mention this up front because it's very possible that, despite The Crimson Diamond's tale of betrayal, murder, and mineral rights in 1914 Canada, the text parser element will be a Rubicon you instantly can't be arsed to cross. A not unreasonable stance - though I think the text parser in The Crimson Diamond is fantastic. Such beef that I have with this adventure game is down to the specificity required to solve some of the puzzles.\nRead more",

Multiplayer shooty Helldivers 2 is still sitting around 35,000 concurrent players, which is perfectly respectable, if only around 10% of its peak back in April. Still, a clutch of disgruntled ‘divers have recently found a novel way to protest an increasingly unpopular series of nerfs: laying down their guns and letting the bots take the damn planet.\n“If Super Earth wanted to remain safe, they would stop nerfing our guns,\" reads one comment on the subreddit, in response to a post titled “Let the bots advance. Let the Super Earth burn.” It seems to have picked up some steam inside the actual game, too. As of earlier this week, there’s only around a thousand players actively trying to stop the bots advancing perilously close to the home planet, via Gamesradar.\nWhether this is all massively overblown for the sake of a dramatic yarn or not, Arrowhead themselves have taken note of player concerns over nerfs. Yesterday, game director Mikael Eriksson unveiled a plan for the next 60 days, directly addressing player feedback over the controversial ‘Escalation of Freedom’ update.\n \nRead more",

It expresses this by way of its scoring system, where you earn \"Prestige points\" for snapping pictures that fit one of five categories: \"Brutal\" scenes of characters being slain; moments of \"Horror\", such as the spectacle of an approaching horde; comical \"Outtakes\", like characters caught in bizarre poses; moments of \"Drama\", such as people reacting to discoveries; and \"Erotic\" photos of women alive or undead, which range from snaps of exposed underwear to close-ups of cleavage.\nThe Erotica tag has, however, been chopped from the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, in what Capcom gingerly suggest isn't \"a response to a changing cultural climate\", but expressive of the view that earning points from such photos is not \"an appropriate reward for survival and not a skill required of a journalist trying to stay alive\".\n Read more",

The Deck’s compatibility issues aren’t nearly as issue-some as they were at launch, but between its Linux-based SteamOS and its relatively mild processing power, but it is true that beefier Windows handhelds will more likely cater to your entire cross-launcher library.\nUnless, that is, you get something else to run them for you. Streaming games on the Steam Deck has emerged as a nifty workaround for the portable PC’s lingering compatibility woes, making even officially unsupported games playable. Usually with much better performance, too, as the actual rendering work is done remotely – what you see on the Deck’s screen is basically a video feed of that remote device’s display output, with your control input beamed the other way via a low-latency connection. And because you’re not using SteamOS or the internal hardware to actually run the game, it’s not bound by their limits.\nRead more",

Isolation is the Alien experience that convinced Álvarez the Alien could still be scary, after decades of milking the creature's dugs for spin-off movies and making it share a screen with the Predator, the Pepsi Max to Alien's Dom Pérignon 1921. In possibly self-defeating homage to Creative Assembly's work, he's filled the movie with Emergency Telephones, turning them into a straightforward-sounding form of foreshadowing.\n Read more",

The early access game is on our best immersive sims list for a reason, you know, and now it has an autumn release date for the final version, along with a new trailer.\nRead more",

          "description": "Last week, Bethesda released a remastered edition of Doom and Doom II on Steam, with lots of extra episodes and improvements. One of these new features is a built-in browser for mods, and support for many existing mods that previously required a different version of the game. Basically, lots of good fan-made mods are now playable on the Steam version of ye olde Doom. That's neat! Ah, but there is some demon excrement on the health pack, so to speak. The mod browser lacks moderation and lets people upload the work of others with their own name pinned as the author. That's prompted one level designer to call it \"a massive breach of trust and violation of norms the Doom community has done its best to hold to for those 30 years.\" \nRead more",

          "description": "Many of the exotics in Destiny 2 are fairly easy to obtain. Provided you snag yourself a few exotic engrams and take a stroll over to Master Rahool, you'll get a good handful to get you started. Exotic engram focusing and the Monument to Lost Light are more difficult methods for obtaining exotic items but still aren't too bad. \n\n\nHowever, some exotics come from the game's hardest pieces of content. Here's how to get the Euphony linear fusion rifle in Destiny 2.\n\n\nWhere to find the Euphony in Destiny 2\n\n\nImage via Bungie.\n\n\nThe Euphony is rewarded as a random drop from completing the final encounter of the Salvation's Edge raid, The Witness. Each successful completion will give you a legendary item and a 5% chance to receive the Euphony. With the way that raid loot works, that gives you three chances each week provided you have three separate characters at the right power level for it.\n\n\nThere are two ways to increase your chances of getting the Euphony. The first method is to simply complete that final encounter and not receive the Euphony. Each time you don't, you'll increase your chances to get the Euphony slightly more. This chance resets upon receiving the Euphony. The other method is through triumphs. If you can complete certain challenges during different encounters for the raid, you can claim them on your Triumphs page (found under Journey in your Inventory) to increase the drop chance.\n\n\nIs the Euphony worth using?\n\n\nThe Euphony's main perk causes sustained damage with the weapon to spawn Threadlings. Alongside this, any Threadling damage from the Euphony or otherwise will add a stack of Spindle, increasing the weapon's damage by 2%. This stacks 25 times. This naturally makes the weapon great for a Threadling build, though on its own it's mediocre at best. It should also only be used on Warlock since it's the best class for it thanks to the new Swarmers exotic leg armor.\n\nThe post How to get the Euphony linear fusion rifle in Destiny 2 appeared first on Destructoid.",

The game brings many elements together in a way that just works, but it could use a few more skins.\n\n\nWhile you've always been able to craft new armor and weapons for your character in Palworld, it hasn't had a ton in the way of customization options for your Pals.

They're only available to users who own the game on PC and have a Steam account they can link to their Twitch account. To get these skins, you need to visit the official Palworld Twitch Drops page and link your accounts. \n\n\nOnce your account is linked, you need to watch a Twitch Drops-enabled stream at the times and dates outlined below to get these three incredibly exclusive skins. \n\n\n\nAugust 21st (Wed) 8 AM to August 27th (Tue) 5 PM (PDT): Golden Relaxaurus\n\n\nAugust 27th (Tue) 5 PM - September 3rd (Tue) 5 PM (PDT): Sailor Quivern\n\n\nSeptember 3rd (Tue) 5 PM - September 10th (Tue) 5 PM (PDT): Summer Chillet\n\n\n\nOnce you've watched an eligible stream, your skins will be added to your Twitch Drops Inventory. This gives you a code to use in-game so you can actually unlock the skins. From there, all you have to do is visit the Pal Dressing Facility in-game and swap the skins directly on your favorite Pals.

          "description": "When you start playing Madden NFL 25, training points might not be on top of your priorities. After all, this specific currency is exclusive to the Ultimate Team. If you're like me and enjoy the Franchise mode now, you won't have to bother too much. \n\n\nBut if you're passionately into building up the best possible fantasy team with colorful cards, having a healthy stack of training points will be necessary.\n\n\nBest way to get training points in Madden NFL 25\n\n\nThe simplest and easiest way to get training points is to sell the player cards you don't need. When you start building up your team, there won't be a huge surplus collection of cards. But that number will change as you complete more objectives and grind the different game modes.\n\n\nImage via Destructoid\n\n\nYou can sell these players for coins. But doing that with every card might not be the optimum path. Instead, you can exchange them for training points. The lower-rated items hardly give a sufficient amount of points. That changes when you exchange cards with higher overall ratings. This is also a great way to utilize BND items that can't be sold on the market. \n\n\nWhile this method is the best and most sustainable way of getting training points, holding on to your cards for now is best. Madden NFL 25 is still in the opening week of full launch, and it's better to hold on to your higher-rated cards as they help to improve your offense and defense.\n\n\nIn Ultimate Team, EA Sports also provides a Training Shuffle Pack program. But I am not a gambling person, and it's best to hold on to your existing points. Once you have a better idea about the auction market, make sure to get higher-rated items for cheap.\n\n\nOnce you quicksell them, you can get many training points to develop your available cards. This flipping method benefits those who can devote a certain amount of time to snipe higher-rated items for cheap.\n\nThe post How to get training points in Madden NFL 25 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "TomorrowHead Studio has revealed its debut game at the Future Game Show today. Will: Follow the Light is a narrative adventure focused on the authenticity of its travel and puzzle systems. It’s coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.\n\n\nI’d refer to it as a walking sim, but I think that would be a misnomer since the trailer focuses just as much on dog sledding and sailing. I mean, I think it fits the genre’s criteria not the name.\n\n\n\n\nAnyway, Will: Follow the Light casts you as a man appropriately named Will who is traveling north to find his lost son. According to the press release, “It explores the relationship between father and son in an adventure taking players on an emotional rollercoaster through wild thunderstorms, the ringing silence of loneliness, and a tale about the importance of caring for loved ones.” Oh okay.\n\n\nWhat I find most interesting is the “realistic controls” of the sailing yacht. The travel segments of the trailer do seem pretty detailed. Moreover, they also say there’s a lifelike navigation system. I have hopes that there is a lot of travel and navigation in Will: Follow the Light, because I feel that it tends to get downplayed in a world with omnipresent fast travel. In games, I mean. Fast travel in real life hasn’t been figured out yet, as far as I know.\n\n\nThe puzzles also seem detailed, as they’re said to be “rooted in real life.” It shows weights being added to an elevator’s counterweight which is kind of neat. It might beat adventure game logic, but maybe not. There might be a reason why few games use puzzles “rooted in real life.”\n\n\nWill: Follow the Light is coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S in 2025.\n\nThe post Will: Follow the Light looks like it will be a detailed take on the narrative adventure genre appeared first on Destructoid.",

It’ll be needed to craft the next level of weapon gear after the Wind Bear Staff.\n\n\nIn any case, here’s what you need to know on how to get the resource so you can craft the next tier of staves.\n\n\nHow to get Refined Iron Sand in Black Myth: Wukong\n\n\nTo get Refined Iron Sand in Black Myth: Wukong, you have to progress into Chapter 3 of the story. After defeating the Yellow Wind Sage, you should get one piece of this.\n\n\nNext, you’ll find more by exploring the side areas and opening chests. However, you’ll still need a few to craft the staff.\n\n\nKeep going until you get to the Mirrormere area. This will be the second Shrine you find in the third chapter. When you arrive at Mirrormere, you can activate the Shrine and actually buy one unit of Refined Iron Sand. \n\n\nWith only one left to get, you will have to defeat the Kang-Jin Loong boss just up ahead at the frozen lake. You’ll be thrown into a new area in this chapter upon defeating her. The final pieces of Refined Iron Sand you’ll need should be in chests in the Pagoda Realm.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nMuch like Silk and other materials that were once scarce, Refined Iron Sand will become a more common resource as you progress through Black Myth: Wukong. \n\n\nMake it a habit to periodically check the shop either from NPCs or Shrines to see if you can buy a few more units of crafting materials such as this. It’ll speed up the process of getting better gear as you further progress through the game.\n\n\nItems from these shops are going to cost Will, but you can always farm that up in areas with dense enemy spawns.\n\nThe post How to get Refined Iron Sand in Black Myth: Wukong appeared first on Destructoid.",

Each time, it may introduce new items, and some might go out of rotation. At the time of writing, the shop has skins for Marvel’s Hulk, Hela, Deadpool, Wolverine, and Guardians of the Galaxy. There are also John Wick, Ninja, Lewis Hamilton, Raiden, and Loserfit outfits and bundles that you can pick up.\n\n\nIf you wish to apply a creator code to support your favorite content creators, you can click the star badge on the top-right of the Fortnite Web Shop and add the respective code before you make your purchase.\n\n\nEpic Games' decision reflects their ongoing efforts to create independent avenues to engage with Fortnite. This also means that players now have the option to purchase in-game items without relying on stores from the likes of Apple or Google, forgoing the platform fee along the way.\n\n\nEpic Games battled both Apple and Google to prove that both companies hold a monopoly over the app market in their respective stores.

          "description": "Finji, Hollowponds, and Richard Hogg have revealed Wilmot Works It Out, a sequel to 2019’s game for organization sickos, Wilmot’s Warehouse. The release date is still TBA, with only PC/Mac announced as platforms.\n\n\nStrangely, Wilmot Works It Out seems to be more of a puzzle game. But not in the sense that Myst is a puzzle game or Tetris is another type of puzzle game. This is more the sense of a jigsaw puzzle being a puzzle game. It has the same push-pull mechanics of Wilmot’s Warehouse, but instead has you making pictures out of a scrambled pile of tiles. Sometimes, a pile contains titles from multiple puzzles.\n\n\n\n\nNot really what I was expecting. On the other hand, it makes perfect sense to add something more specific to the organization side of things. I’m also not certain that it’s something I’m interested in, but there are a lot of charming details to it. It could definitely be a cozy experience for people who are somehow able to listen to their own thoughts without becoming distressed.\n\n\nBeyond that, I’m not really sure what to say. Check out the trailer, and you’ll probably know if this is the sort of thing you’ll dig. The soundtrack is by returning composer Eli Rainsberry. It’s said to contain over 60 puzzles, and you can unlock various items to decorate your puzzle-solving room.\n\n\nWilmot Works it Out is coming to PC and Mac at an undetermined time in the future.\n\nThe post Wilmot’s Warehouse sequel Wilmot Works it Out has less manual labor, more puzzles appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, to find the final key, you'll need to talk to a picky raven and cook some bird food using vegetables and fish.\n\n\nHow to make Bird Food during The Palace of Time\n\n\nUnlike regular recipes in Disney Dreamlight Valley, bird food requires a bit of puzzle-solving. Below is a quick list of ingredients you need:\n\n\n\nRipe Tomato\n\n\nRipe Carrot\n\n\nRotten Fish\n\n\nRotten Clam\n\n\n\nYou'll discover a hint to this recipe by reading the journal next to the ingredient table. Although it doesn't explicitly tell you all four items, it'll reveal that the raven loves rotten seafood and fresh vegetables.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nWhen you first open the laboratory's ingredient table, however, you won't find the rotten fish immediately. Instead, you'll see four ripe items, two of which you need for the recipe. Pick up the ripe carrot and tomato before interacting with the nearby hourglass.\n\n\nOnce you interact with the hourglass, all four items will turn rotten. Although you don't need all four items, the rotten clam and fish are key components to this dish. It may be gross to us, but the raven loves it.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nNow that you have the bird food, bring it to the raven to advance one step closer to completing Jafar's Laboratory quest. The raven will give you a power coil, which you'll use to power up the nearby pillar and unlock the door. Behind this door is the key you need for the Palace of Time quest, so make sure to pick it up before leaving.\n\nThe post How to make Bird Food in Disney Dreamlight Valley appeared first on Destructoid.",
