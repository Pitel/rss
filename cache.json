We can see what the developers were going for with a Space theme and a Grimes track but... never mind.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The 36-year-old former full-back, a Stockport native and lifelong fan of the Vanarama National League club, has a tactical style best described as 'my dad after three pints'. Route-one, 4-4-2, and no 'larking about'. He thinks a gegenpress is something you use to get the creases out of your trousers.\nHattrick is a quintessentially English anachronism, whose ignorance of the modern game represents my own unfamiliarity with modern Football Manager. It's been quite some time since I last sported the greying temples and Fray-Bentos paunch of football's favourite scapegoat, and returning to Football Manager is a bit like meeting up with an old girlfriend after they've had their consciousness uploaded into an all-knowing AI. I vaguely recognise the face behind all the ones and zeroes, but that person I once snuggled up with on winter evenings has ascended into something vast, intimidating, and utterly obsessed with data.\nRead more",

          "description": "Moncage is one of those puzzle games of intermittent lightbulb moments. One minute you see solutions with perfect clarity. The next you're left scratching your head and wondering how the heck you're meant to proceed. It wouldn't be much of a puzzle game if there weren't a few moments like this, of course, but when you're playing out mechanical riddles across five possible surfaces - in this case, the sides and top of a rotatable cube - Moncage can sometimes veer into giving you a complete cerebral blackout, leaving you at an impasse until you consult its series of timed hints (or, if you're really desperate, an in-game video solution). \nWhen the lightbulb pings into bright, brilliant existence, though, Moncage can be truly illuminating. As you rotate, prod and investigate its five little vignettes to line-up matching bits of scenery in one tile to affect the corresponding bit in another, Optillusion's debut game harks back to the best bits from Fireproof Studios' The Room series. It's a beautifully crafted little thing, and it builds on its ideas to create some genuinely standout moments of optical wizardry. If only the story it was trying to tell was half so elegant.\nRead more",

It's a third-person puzzle adventure. You gather the evidence, cross reference it all, and then come to a conclusion on the case. Young Holmes returned to Cordona to find out how his mum died a decade ago, and is helped by his best mate Jon, this season's Creepy Watson. Boy, do they get in some scrapes along the way! Bingo, bango, there's yer preamble.\nBut the complex explanation is that this game, ironically, defies explanation. As I played, I oscillated wildly between thinking, \"This is Frogwares' world and we're all just living in it!\" and, \"What is even happening, what is this, I need a ten-part documentary series that just follows the developers around because they really have a lot of explaining to do.\"\nRead more",

          "description": "Morse, the strategy game that teaches you real morse code to win a war, has come a long way since we first wrote about it in 2015. What started out as a free flash game (and a makeshift telegraph key made out of a clothes peg) now has proper 3D graphics and quite possibly the most impressive custom controller setup I've ever seen. When I played the demo at EGX 2021 last month, not only had creator AlexVSCoding made an entire telegraph machine for the occasion, but he'd also managed to source a pair of headphones from the 1930s to really hammer home the idea of being a wartime telegraph operator. \nObviously, you don't need a pair of 90-year-old headphones to enjoy playing Morse. A modern headset will do just as well. You also don't technically need the telegraph machine either, as there's an onscreen button interface you can click with your mouse. But let me tell you, pressing those morse code buttons in-game wasn't half as immersive as tapping out the commands on a proper dedicated machine, and I wish there was some way Morse could give everyone that experience when it finally launches in full.\nRead more",

          "description": "I think I've figured out a way to improve efficiency of heating and cooling my flat across the year by making my choices of games seasonal. In summer, I should be playing vintage games, games which a modern PC can run without even noticing, my silicon frigid. As autumn sets in, I should be playing progressively more demanding games, games that stress my CPU and GPU, pump out more heat. Then in the depths of winter, I'll break out the ugliest ReShade presets and \"HD\" texture packs I can find, light this tower on fire. But anyway, what are you playing this weekend?\nRead more",

I consider laughing at the end of all my sentences. So yeah, to say my time with the closed network test was infectious is an understatement. But there’s just one detail rattling around my brain I simply can’t shake.\nAnd it’s to do with where I stood in the game’s world. How strong was I? At what point do I take on the big dragon? Should I be here, or over there now? Souls games haven’t traditionally been good at letting you know these things, but Elden Ring felt more confusing. Time to investigate.\nRead more",

I've tried to play FromSoftware's much lauded masterpieces several times over the years, but I'm simply not good enough at them to find them enjoyable. No matter how much you try and tell me about the sweet satisfaction you feel after finally beating a boss on the 57th attempt, I've come to realise I simply don't have the time or the patience to see it through. I'm not sure I ever will, either. \nIt's the same reason I tend to veer away from a lot of other Soulslike games as well. I never really got on with Dead Cells, for instance, and don't even get me started on Sekiro. But cor, I do also love it when a game proves me wrong. Hollow Knight was the first Soulslike to rekindle my rather begrudging relationship with these games, and now I've fallen hook, line and sinker for Death's Door, the crow reaper sword 'em up from Titan Souls creators Acid Nerve. \nRead more",

From its music, to the quotations scattered on its loading screens, to the great steaming swamp of Jeff Goldblum voice acting, it’s a solid case study in how a studio can get its money’s worth from an expensive license. And at its heart, of course, is a stable of spectacular dinosaurs.\nUsing lessons learned from Planet Zoo’s development, which has more or less filled the time since 2016’s Jurassic World Evolution, Frontier have come back with the most beautiful, the most real dinosaurs ever to trudge and honk their way across a monitor. It’s proper John Hammond, spared-no-expense, sunglasses-off-and-gawp stuff. Which makes it all the more painfully frustrating to realise that they’re trapped, once again, in a seriously wonky management game. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "The key to a good mystery, in my opinion, is narrative constraint. When the rules of a mystery - what the investigator can and cannot do, who and what was where and when - are laid out clearly for the audience, working within those limitations to puzzle out the case (a la any book by Agatha Christie, the who-dun-it queen) becomes irresistible.\r\n\n\nConway: Disappearance At Dahlia View knows exactly what its story, and its protagonist specifically, can and cannot do. Robert Conway can use his decades of experience as a private investigator to look for missing child Charlotte May Morgan, but what he cannot do is leave Dahlia View or get caught by the police. From his wheelchair, Conway surveys his neighbours from the window of his second-floor flat, occasionally venturing down into the quiet courtyard below to infiltrate his neighbour’s homes. Though due to the declines of age or sheer arrogance, he does neither half so subtly as he’d like to think.\r\n\n\r\nWithin these parameters, Conway presents a classic locked room mystery, only the “room” is the neighbourhood of Dahlia View and, unbeknownst to Conway but made known to the audience, this has all happened before.\r\n\n \nRead more",

If you applied for the CNT and got selected, you'll be able to experience everything I'm about to tell you for yourself starting this Friday, November 12th, until Monday November 15th.

          "description": "Linux 5.16-rc1 is coming out later today and already I'm seeing some fallout in the new kernel's performance... In particular, bad news for Alder Lake that is already seeing the Linux performance trailing Windows 11 seemingly due to the lack of Thread Director integration right now in the kernel and any other missing optimizations around Intel's hybrid architecture. A new feature of Linux 5.16 is unfortunately having unintended regressions for Alder Lake with at least the flagship Core i9 12900K. Here are the results from the latest kernel bisecting that uncovered this latest upstream slowdown.",

At E3, we learned that the former will be an Xbox exclusive and Day One Game Pass addition. Information surrounding the next Elder Scrolls title, however, has been much harder to come across. Still, a GQ interview with Xbox’s leading man Phil Spencer unearthed some exciting new details about Bethesda’s flagship video game series. Nothing is confirmed yet, but Phil Spencer envisions Elder Scrolls VI as an Xbox exclusive. \nThis exclusivity would be a groundbreaking decision for the games community and the western RPG scene if cleared. “Starfield, arguably the biggest game of 2022, will be Xbox and PC only,” the GQ article reads. “Spencer says he sees the same for The Elder Scrolls VI.” Spencer himself went on to say that having sole rights to both highly-anticipated Bethesda titles isn’t about “punishing any other platform.” Instead, “In order to be on Xbox, I want us to be able to bring the full complete package of what we have. And that would be true when I think about Elder Scrolls VI. That would be true when I think about any of our franchises.”\nThe Elder Scrolls VI might use the same overhauled engine as Starfield, but its release is still far off. Todd Howard confirmed that the game is still in its “design phase.” This, of course, is a little deflating, considering the first teaser was released three years ago. On the other hand, Starfield drops next year on November 11 for Xbox Series X/S and PC. \nDo you think the Elder Scrolls VI will be an exclusive or is that simply wishful thinking?

After running down Samus' 2D outings, we’re ready to venture into the world of 3D with Metroid Prime.\nReleased on November 17, 2002 for Nintendo's Gamecube, Metroid Prime is often considered one of the best games of its era. However, to better understand Metroid Prime's influence we first have to go back to the tumultuous founding of Retro Studios. In order to develop Metroid Prime, Retro canceled four other projects, and even then many of its designers almost didn't survive development. In the end, Retro created a total masterpiece that feels ahead of its time. Join us as we talk about Retro's struggles, why Shigeru Miyamoto felt that the morph ball was essential to the formula, and how we almost saw Kraid in 3D. \nJoin hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and special guest, Game Informer's own Blake Hester (@metallicaisrad) for the next hour as we explore Metroid Prime's lore, development history, and lasting impact. \nIf you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com.

No doubt there's been an impressive amount DualSense controller recharges as well. Along with these impressive stats, Ryan listed off the top ten most played games on PS5 over the past year. Some are less surprising, but a few launch titles managed to stick on the list despite some more popular games. \nFortnite\nCall of Duty: Black Ops Cold War\nFIFA 21\nNBA 2K21\nAssassin’s Creed Valhalla\nDestiny 2\nMLB The Show 21\nMarvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales\nDemon’s Souls\nNBA 2K22\nIt's great to see Miles Morales and Demon's Souls hanging with the heaviest time-sinks like Fortnite and Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, especially since they're day one releases with (mostly) single-player campaigns. \nJim Ryan also takes a moment to highlight other big Sony exclusive games like Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart, Returnal, and Deathloop, as well as recent studio acquisitions of Bluepoint Games, Firesprite, Housemarque, and Nixxes. He lays out a glimpse at the future, with megaton releases coming next year and beyond in God of War Ragnarok, Horizon: Forbidden West, and Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake. In total, 25 games from Playstation Studios are currently in development for PlayStation 5.\nDespite the availability woes facing PlayStation 5, it's had quite the first year with plenty of current and upcoming reasons to make the upgrade. That is if you're lucky enough to find one in the coming months. \nWhat's your most played games on PS5 this year? Let us know in the comments below!",

If you’ve enjoyed Outriders and the idea of playing more of it sounds appealing, you’ll need to tune into Square Enix’s Twitch channel this Monday, November 15 at 9:00 a.m. Pacific/12:00 p.m. Eastern.  \nOutriders has been relatively quiet the past few months in terms of major updates. Outside of squashing bugs, stabilizing servers, and tinkering with loot drops, People Can Fly has kept any big expansion plans close to the vest until now. The game has felt a bit forgotten as a result despite earning a 9 out of 10 review score from us at launch. Outriders is an entertaining co-op shooter, especially alongside friends, so we’re excited to see what People Can Fly has in store. \nOutriders is available now on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Stadia, and PC.

As a result, all batteries in Playdates set to ship had to be replaced.\n“This quickly turned into a months-long, all-hands-on-deck research stress-ball and we halted production at the factory,” a press release reads. “We made the difficult, expensive call to replace all of our existing batteries with new ones from a totally different battery supplier.” \nPanic says the first batch consisted of 20,000 units, all planned to ship late 2021 (presumably now or soon) but that now, they’ll ship in early 2022. A more precise shipping window was not revealed. If you’ve preordered a Playdate, Panic says your place in line to actually receive the device will not change so long as your preorder remains active. \nFor more about this unique handheld gaming device, check out Game Informer’s breakdown of its price, its first slate of games, and more. The Playdate isn't the only upcoming handheld device to suffer a delay. The release of Valve's Steam Deck was just pushed from this holiday to a February 2022 launch. \nDid you preorder a Playdate?

IGN premiered the trailer for the wall-crawler’s upcoming Hero Event on November 30, which will be exclusive to the PlayStation versions of the game.\nFor those afraid Crystal Dynamics might screw up Spidey from a personality standpoint, the trailer proves he still has his endearingly dorky sense of humor and quips (including making a Mortal Kombat reference of all things). It remains to be seen how Spider-Man’s powers translate into gameplay given there’s no in-game footage. Hopefully, that reveal will come sooner than later given how close we are to Pete’s arrival. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nSpider-Man joins the fray via the Hero Event “With Great Power”. He’ll team up with the Avengers to take on AIM and thwart a mysterious new threat. There’s no indication of how big or long the event is, but it will be free to PS5 and PS4 players. For those playing on other platforms, a big update also hits November 30 that adds a new four-player raid, power level cap increase, and other changes you can read more about here.\n[Source: IGN]",

Join Matt Miller and Alex Stadnik as they take you on a brief 4K tour of some of the things you can expect from Master Chief's next adventure!\nThere's a ton to unpack here, but we're showing off one of the new base encounters for players to frag their way through in today's video. Throughout Halo Infinite's campaign, you'll have to make your way through Banished strongholds to complete your mission, whether that's saving Spartans and UNSC marines or fighting off some of the game's most treacherous bosses. There's no right way to take on these encounters either – one person may find it advantageous to sneak their way through these structures, while others will want to go in guns-a-blazing (like you'll see in the footage above). \nWhile you're giving the Banished hell, don't forget to look around. In today's gameplay video, we show you the location of a Spartan Core, the game's upgrade currency that will enhance Chief's equipment, such as the Grappleshot. \nWe also get to show off one of the game's newest weapons: the Stalker Rife. It's a Banished weapon that feels like it's in the family of the Covenant Carbine, although this semi-automatic rifle packs more of a punch and is perfect for mid to long-range encounters.\nThis is just the start of the fun for fans eagerly awaiting the December 8 release of Halo Infinite! Join us over the next few weeks at Game Informer as we offload a ton of new information about developer 343's latest entry in the iconic series, including a deeper dive into the campaign, our new impressions of the single-player mode, and so much more!

As I checked out a three-hour demo of the campaign, it was apparent that Master Chief’s newest adventure affords the option of a familiar action-packed “golden path.” Like nearly all previous Halo games, Infinite’s mostly linear main story playthrough aims to offer a satisfying and tightly paced adventure, a defined and engaging narrative, and clear objective markers that carry you to the subsequent big setpiece encounter. Based on the extensive demo I experienced, players looking for that classic Halo campaign structure won’t be disappointed.\nHowever, the alternative path through the game sets Halo Infinite apart from what has come before.

These allow players to customize the experience in a given GTA game to their liking. Maybe they have too much police heat on them? A cheat can fix that. Maybe they need a rocket launcher immediately? A cheat can get them that. Really, for a lot of wants and needs in GTA, there’s an accompanying cheat. \nHowever, some of the cheats previously seen in GTA III, GTA: San Andreas, and GTA: Vice City have been cut, according to Rockstar, although the company opted to stay mum on the topic when asked about which ones by USA Today, as reported by Eurogamer. \n“We actually had to remove a couple for technical reasons, certain things that didn’t play well in the Unreal base,” Rockstar Games producer Rich Rosado told USA Today. “But that’s actually where I’ll leave it. There’s some fun with discovery. I’m not saying plus or minus, but I’d rather not just go right on the nose before the release and go straight to the end credits.” \nUSA Today notes that Rosado opted not to reveal which cheats won’t be present. Rosado also opted not to reveal whether or not any new cheats had been added to the trilogy. Perhaps players will soon be discovering new cheats as the remastered trilogy launches today.\nWhile waiting for it to go live, read about how GTA: San Andreas is in development for Oculus Quest 2 and then check out the full music roster for GTA: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition after that.  \n[Source: Eurogamer, USA Today]\nAre you picking up GTA: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition today?

Sure, the GTA series on PlayStation had a reputation for being a vulgar and violent yet captivating sandbox, but the shift to a full 3D Liberty City in GTA3 shattered our perception of immersion possible at the time. Subsequent releases of Vice City and San Andreas built on the mold set by Rockstar, with bigger locations, more vehicles, weapons, activities, and debauchery. As the generations passed and GTA evolved into what we know it to be today with Grand Theft Auto V and GTA Online, the original 3D trilogy became more of a fond memory, left to stay in the past than to be played in their original forms. That is, until today.\nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nJoin us for an earlier and extended Game Informer Live at Noon Central on Twitch featuring John Carson and Andrew Reiner. We'll be taking our first look at Rockstar's remastered collection Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition.

Unfortunately, according to a new Bloomberg report, it’s going to be even more challenging as Sony has reportedly cut its PS5 production numbers target by at least 1 million. The company initially aimed to assemble and manufacture more than 16 million PS5s before the end of March 2022, but that number was trimmed to roughly 15 million. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nBloomberg’s report states that the original 16 million target was named to achieve its sales goal for the period and get a headstart on production for next year. As expected, the reason is “logistics issues and part shortages,” which have grown to be more severe for Sony, according to its chief financial officer Hiroki Totoki in an investors call in October. \nThe PS5 is the first Sony console that reached 10 million units sold the fastest; Sony achieved this milestone in July. Still, Bloomberg reports that the pace has fallen behind due to production issues. Now, the PS5 is lagging behind the PlayStation 4. \nWhile waiting for more PS5s to become available, read about how Nintendo is going through a similar struggle, having cut its Switch production output down by 20% due to production issues. \n[Source: Bloomberg]\nHave you purchased a PS5?
