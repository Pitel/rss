We turned the lights down low, put on some headphones and, with the clear aim of savouring every moment, held the Switch’s OLED screen so close to our face that we became fully immersed in this visual novel’s rich four-colour pixel graphics and oscillating, unnerving chiptune soundscape.\nOur slightly obsessive behaviour was no surprise considering how much this writer enjoyed the previous two Pixel Pulps, Mothmen 1966 and Varney Lake, visual novels of genre-defining quality in the most crucial of ways—that they were a lot of fun to play (especially Mothmen). These predecessors were hyper-imaginative horror stories told to an impressive storytelling standard, seemingly inspired by the retro likes of Weird Tales magazine. To our tastes, this series already deserves to be the standard bearer for visual novels as a whole. They’re the kind of idiosyncratic, quality production that can elevate a genre out of what is a fairly small niche.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "And nearly 7 since its first announcement.\nIn recent years, Nintendo has become extremely efficient when it comes to announcing and releasing its games. Tears of the Kingdom aside, there has mostly been only a handful of months between the initial announcement and the release of many of the company's major software titles.\nThe same, however, cannot be said for Metroid Prime 4. Initially announced on June 13th, 2017 (nearly 7 years ago), the game's development was rebooted exactly 5 years ago, with an announcement posted on Nintendo's YouTube channel on January 25th, 2019 from Nintendo EPD's Shinya Takahashi (thanks, Stealth).\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

We'd be pretty confident assuming that a crossover isn't coming our way anytime soon, but if the last few years have proven one thing, it's that you can never rule out the hacking community.\n'Resident Evil Kart' is a new ROM hack from SNES hacker MrL314 which brings the two series together in the most challenging way possible. No, this isn't Jill Valentine speeding around Moo Moo Meadows (as much as we'd love to see that), instead, it takes Resident Evil's classic perspective shots — the fixed camera angles — and adds them to Super Mario Kart.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Nabbing a 9/10 score in our review, it quickly became one of those very special games that we just straight-up refuse to ever delete off our SD cards. Still easily one of the console's best fighters, it's a slick and addictive work of indie art that only missed out on a perfect score due to some very disappointing online issues. And hey, now it's got a sequel!\nYep, UNDER NIGHT IN-BIRTH II Sys:Celes (herein referred to as 'UNI2' because we're down with the kids) sees you return to a world where humans ravaged by the 'Hollow Night' (scary void monsters) become In-Births. In-Births gain the ability to control a power known as EXS, and that's how...well, that's how they fight so good. We don't understand much more of the story in all honesty, beyond this and the fact there's a 500-year-old girl named Linne knocking about, we're just happy that we understand what the franchise's crazy name is all about now.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Switch gamers can't access it on Nintendo's console, of course, but with its aesthetic parallels to Pokémon, it's been the main talking point for many of us as we await the first Nintendo Direct of the year and the inevitable Pokémon Presents showcase at the end of February.\nPalworld's well-worn 'Pokémon-with-guns' descriptor, coupled with a very successful marketing campaign — seriously, it feels like this was Promoted in our feeds for the last decade — has led to downloads in the millions and fiery debate online, with legions of fans coming to its defence from allegations of plagiarism and asset theft. These accusations suggest that Pocketpair — who has form when it comes to making games which look an awful lot like other games — may have taken its search for inspiration too far in this case, with certain Pal models that appear too close to certain Pokémon counterparts to be coincidence.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

I also say this as someone who's never played or understood a game of poker in her life, because let's face it, regular poker is quite boring. Balatro, on the other hand, is poker that's turbo-charged with magic Joker cards, tarot card multipliers, and blind conditions that make a successful hand increasingly tricky to pull off. And it's coming out in full real soon, too. \nRead more",

Your titular tiny heroine can't jump very far on her own, you see, so to save her beloved sunflowers from the spiky thorns of an ominous-looking tree, she'll need to fire them around the environment to help hoist her over obstacles to get to the, err, root of the problem.

But it wasn't till I embraced the holy medium of videogames that I realised the full potential of balldom. \r\n\n\r\nInitiated, of course, by Sonic the Hedgehog, I descended into a frothing ballpit of ball variations, encompassing everything from the squashy rolling UFOs of Exo One through Katamari Damacy to the overcrowded chutes of Marble World and the spectacle of Overwatch's Hammond clearing out a capture point by means of sheer, delicious torque. I am always up for a game in which you either control or become a ball, and Go Mecha Ball looks like one of the better ones.\n  \nRead more",

And look, here it is in Early Access. Roots isn't one of your traditional, SimCity-derived town sims in which you steadily colonise a single map (at least, until you lose patience with your glittering urban creation and press the Godzilla or Hurricane button). As per the roguelike element, it's a game about being on the run. \r\n\n\r\nIn Roots, you take charge of a band of warriors fleeing an expanding purple smog, the Ginnungagap, in a flying longship. To escape its coils, you must land on floating islands, play cards to raise settlements, and harvest energy for your vessel from the titular roots of the World Tree. Succumb to the advancing mists, and you'll time-rewind back to your Holt to unlock new mechanics and upgrades. There are also various big-league mythological celebrities to meet and recruit, and a variety of randomised encounters and events to shake up each run. Here's the launch trailer.\r\n\n Read more",

Great building, a sense of scale, a beautiful atmosphere, and the ability to die in extremely stupid ways. In Minecraft, it's digging straight down into lava. In Valheim, it's getting crushed by the very tree you'd just chopped down. And after dying for the third time by trying to climb a slightly-too-steep hill, slipping down and building enough momentum to send me careening off the cliff to my death, I realised that Enshrouded, too, ticks all the boxes for maybe one day being listed among the titans of the genre.\nOne paragraph in, and I've already compared Enshrouded to Valheim. You'll see that quite a bit throughout this review, and for good reason. Enshrouded has come the closest for me to recapturing that feeling of when the world collectively discovered Valheim for the first time. But that's both an accolade and a reservation. Because it's not quite there... yet.\n Read more",

I sit there with a big toybox of lovely things to stick together, but always end up deflated and disappointed with my own lack of imagination. But Summerhouse, the sandbox citybuilder (or townbuilder, more like) from solo developer Friedemann is just teeny-tiny enough to give me a sense of creative satisfaction.

          "description": "Riot Games have announced that they will shortly lay off \"about 530\" people, or 11 per cent of their global workforce, so as to \"create focus and move us towards a more sustainable future\", in the words of CEO Dylan Jadeja. The \"biggest impact\" will be felt outside of core development, though the reductions will affect at least one major internal team - the developers of Legends Of Runeterra. Riot are also binning off the Riot Forge publishing label, under which third-party developers create smaller-scale games based on Riot's own intellectual properties.\r\n \nRead more",

I'm currently burning one called Starry Night, which is a nice fresh scent but it's nowhere near as strong as I would like. I can never find fresh scents that are as long-lingering as the fruity or woody ones. Anyway, I have been discussing my new interest (and interrupting work meetings with pretend candle unboxing videos where I tell them to like and subscribe and check out my collab with WickManiac) with the rest of the Treehouse, which prompted us to talk about the idea of gamer candles. They exist! They're just candles of lies. \nRead more",

Currently, those playing on Game Pass still don't have the ability to join or create dedicated servers for up to 32-player multiplayer like their mates on Steam can. Instead, they remain limited to just 2-4-player co-op via the use of friend codes, meaning that Game Pass players aren't having quite the same experience as their Steam counterparts. \nRead more",

          "description": "Basically the only sort of strategy games I like are city builders, so I was interested in the playtest for El Dorado: The Golden City Builder, which casts you as the leader of an ancient Mayan-ish city. The playtest is only the prologue, but the eventual goal is to take over the Yucatán peninsula, and if nothing else it's refreshing to see a city-builder that doesn't feel overwhelmingly European. It also has a complicated system of religion. Whereas in a similarly polytheistic game like Zeus, the gods would turn up to stomp on buildings and/or bless them, at fairly large intervals, in El Dorado I was getting a home immolated every few days. Building shrines that have an area of effect, and that require resources to run and protect your town, is its own supply chain in El Dorado. This is a very interesting idea that I liked.\nBut. The aforementioned deities are figures from Maya mythology, and the Yucatán peninsula is the bit where the Mayans lived, so I just find it a bit sus the word \"Mayan\" does not appear anywhere on the Steam page or in the press release materials. Sometimes said materials say \"the Yucatán peninsula\", and sometimes \"the mystical land of Jukatan\", which could well be an innocent translation mistake, but doesn't make me less sus. I've hedged my bets by saying \"Mayan-ish\" - just as an uncharitable person could say the devs are doing...\nRead more",

While the game's mechanics are more reminiscent of Ark: Survival Evolved and other tree-punching, template-arranging wilderness sims, its monsters owe obvious debts to Nintendo and Game Freaks' Pokémon games. \nThe developers have something of a track record on this front, with their older early access release Craftopia freely stirring in nods to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. But what separates copyright infringement from a flagrant, but perfectly legal rip-off? Given that a lot of people are making the case for Palworld being copyright theft online, I thought it might be useful to seek insight from (ominous roll of thunder) an actual lawyer.\nRead more",

          "description": "For a series that's defined by its trials and elaborate murder cases, the greatest crime in Ace Attorney history is arguably one we never get to see or take part in. Okay, maybe crime is too strong a word. Miscarriage of justice is perhaps more appropriate, and specifically that of Apollo Justice, the cover star of this latest trilogy in Capcom's beloved lawyer 'em up. Except poor old Apollo isn't really what holds this collection of Ace Attorneys 4, 5 and 6 together at all. Sure, he features in all of them, but at the end of the day, it's still the series' original bluffer supreme Phoenix Wright who heads up most of the casework here, relegating his new protegee back to bench-warming duties almost as soon as Apollo's debut game rolls its credits. What's more, he quickly has to share that space with Athena Cykes, another new hotshot lawyer that enters the firm in Dual Destinies and continues the scrappy defence trifecta in Spirit Of Justice.\nThe result is a set of games that feel considerably wobblier than Capcom's first and more robust Ace Attorney trilogy, and quite a bit more unfocused than the more recent Victorian-era spin-off, The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles. But despite a slightly unsure start, there are still plenty of career highs to be found here for Wright, Cykes and Justice, and Spirit Of Justice in particular remains one of the series' best entries to date. Those new to Ace Attorney should absolutely begin their journey elsewhere, but for series completionists, the Apollo Justice Trilogy is quite the welcome development.\nRead more",

Right now, it's doing almost twice the numbers of Steam's usual chart-topper Counter-Strike 2. We have entered the Pal Age, it seems - but how long will the feeding frenzy last? How much is owing to it releasing during the quiet time of year with a meme-ish premise, while capitalising on pent-up demand for a proper PC version of Nintendo's monster-catching series?

But me, after six hours of walking over thin, old snow, the good stuff finally started to fall as I entered a wood and approached a waterfall. Pretty magic, really.

          "description": "For a game that's been repeatedly described as \"Pokémon with machineguns\", the first thing that strikes me about Palworld is just how un-Pokémon-like it actually is. To its credit, it does do quite a good Pokémon Legends: Arceus impression when you first step out on its big, Breath Of The Wild-style hilltop and take in the open world vista of its monster-stuffed starting continent. But if the opening moments of washing up on the island in nothing but your very scantily clad undies hadn't already given it away (seriously, why do shipwrecks always destroy the clothes you had on, but not your smalls underneath?), then the ream of tutorial prompts about punching trees to get more wood, building bases, putting pals to work on said bases, and the endless parade of crafting technologies you'll need to unlock to actually do anything on this godforsaken rock will quickly pull the wool clear away from your hopeful little face. \nFor underneath the cute round eyes of its cover stars, Palworld is really a survival game wearing the dead skin suits of Game Freak's catch 'em all monster friends. In a lot of cases, those skin suits are quite literal, such are the blatant palette swaps and so-close-to-copyright-infringement-I-can't-believe-Nintendo's-lawyers-haven't-shut-this-down-years-ago rip-off creatures on display here. For that reason alone, Palworld can feel about as soulless and cynical as it comes. But that's not the worst of it. Even aside from all the survival gubbins, base building and sweatshop automation practices shoved down your throat, Palworld is just an awful example of monster-catching games in general. If it's a Pokémon game on PC you're after, go and play Cassette Beasts. Go and play Coromon, TemTem, or Monster Sanctuary. Anything but this. \nRead more",

The first to come out (albeit only on Netflix at the moment) was the turn-based strategy game Highwater (also a bit of a dud, based on the early Steam demo I played last year), but it's the second game, The Cub (out today on Steam) that has prompted this current moment of teeth-sucking sadness. \nI've been playing a bit of it over the last week, and oh man, it's trying so, so hard to be like Limbo and Inside, but just... doing quite a terrible job of it all.

But it's grown on me a lot, and though it may not be quite the kind of turn-based RPG I get on with best, it's an enjoyable one with a refreshing lack of bloat and timewasting, and with a class and combat system that will be pure catnip to a particular kind of player.\nRead more",

          "description": "Earlier this week, Blizzard announced what's coming up in Season 3 of Diablo 4, and underneath the mountain's worth of lore and loot updates, there was the surprisingly good news that WASD key controls were finally being added to help provide even more accurate and precise movement in the game over the series' traditional mouse clicks. Not that any of them could decide how to actually pronounce WASD when it came to talking about them on last night's Developer Update stream, though, as there were competing cries of \"was-dee\", \"wased\" and \"double-you-ey-es-dee\" all over the shop as they debated this clearly very \"controversial topic\" live on air. Read on for more details about what they're hoping to achieve with WASD controls in the game, but more importantly: how do you pronounce WASD? Let's get a poll up asap.  \nRead more",

          "description": "Back in the depths of 2023's February Steam Next Fest, Roots Of Yggdrasil was one of a handful of games that really caught my attention. Not because it was another beautiful-looking deckbuilder (though that does seem to be a steadily growing niche of mine these days), or because its colourful, inkwash visuals had the air of a Norse-flavoured Okami about them (though it did also help). Rather, it was the way its roguelike foundations meshed with its freeform, but still very goal-driven turn-based building systems, giving you drive and purpose in your construction choices, while also being light and chill, with just the right amount of existential threat nipping at your heels.\nIt struck me that if, say, my best puzzle strategy bud Dorfromantik was ever turned into a roguelike, this is probably a good approximation of what it would look and feel like, which is, frankly, yep, I'd like that game right now, please. Happily, with Roots Of Yggdrasil now approaching its early access launch on January 24th, I'm very happy to report that it's come on leaps and bounds since that Next Fest demo. This is already a very moreish and polished building game, and I've been struggling to tear myself away from it as I guide my longboat of magic Vikings away from their impending Ragnarok.\nRead more",

The MMOFPS has no barber, no surgeon, it's new character or nothing. After six years (longer, if you count the first game), Bungie are finally planning to change this.

Lidé prý už začínají vyjíždět auty ven, což podle všeho ještě není úplně bezpečné.

What I didn't expect, however, was the massive scope of the game.\n\n\nIf you haven't played it—you really owe it to yourself to—Dyson Sphere Program basically drops you onto a planet in a bigger solar system, where you have to build up functioning factories to harvest the resources on the planet and tech up.

          "description": "If you thought the idea of a live-action Final Fantasy XIV series sounded like a massive undertaking, you'd be right. One of the executive producers, Dinesh Shamdasani of Hivemind Entertainment, recently confirmed that the project has been canceled. \n\n\nWhen asked about the status of the live-action Final Fantasy XIV on Twitter, Shamdasani straight up said it's \"dead.\" While they had a \"fantastic pilot script\" by Ben Lustig and Jake Thornton (Winter's Knight) and a multi-season plan, everything was rejected. According to Shamdasani, it was the risk inherent to the \"size and scale\" of the project that ultimately did it in. Apparently, Amazon came the closest to footing the bill for this one. \n\n\n\n\nWriter Jake Thornton chimed in, as well, citing Covid as one of the culprits behind the decision. \"We took it out just as studios began to zip up their purse strings,\" Thornton added. \n\n\nAs for whether or not animation would be more suitable for something like Final Fantasy XIV, Shamdasani was quick to put an end to any further hope for the series, at least for now. Not only did he say that animation would be more difficult, he mentioned that they no longer have the rights to the title. \n\n\nEorzea out of sight\n\n\nPlans for the live-action Final Fantasy XIV were first revealed back in 2019, and had Square Enix teaming up with Sony Pictures Television and Hivemind. The initial announcement promised a new story set in Eorzea along with series mainstays like Chocobos, airships, and even the \"live-action debut of Cid.\" \n\n\nHivemind previously worked with Netflix on The Witcher and with Amazon on The Expanse, so the experience and potential was there. For the time being, at least we'll always have Dad of Light. \n\nThe post Live-action Final Fantasy XIV series canceled due to ‘size and scale’  appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Announced in September, we've been awaiting confirmation as to when the Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition would launch on PC. Today, Sony gave us our answer. \n\n\nThe Complete Edition dropped for PlayStation 5 on October 6. It brought with it a slew of bonus content on top of the revered Burning Shores expansion. All of this will be included within the PC Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition, now slated to release on March 21.\n\n\n\n\nThe majority of the PC Complete Edition's content is similar to that of the PlayStation 5 version, But the PC port has some additional bells and whistles that will excite those with more heftier hardware. PC players will have the option to unlock frame rates, personalize their graphics settings, and enjoy advanced performance features like NVIDIA's DLSS 3 upscaling and frame generation.\n\n\nAs for monitors, ultra-wide support has been implemented so that PC players can enjoy all of Forbidden West's incredible environments. You'll have the ability to go as far as a triple monitor setup, with resolution options including 21:9, 32:9, and 48:9.\n\n\nMouse and keyboard controls are fully customizable, of course. Steam Input support is implemented so that you can remap your controller of choice. Including the PlayStation DualSense which allows PC players to enjoy Guerilla Games' use of the controller's haptic feedback abilities. \n\n\nAs for the Complete Edition's bonus content, there are a handful of new outfits and weapons that will be available for download. Also included are a resource pack, an Apex Clawstrider Machine Strike Piece, and an exclusive Photo Mode pose and face paint that's only in the Complete Edition. You can get the full breakdown over on the PlayStation Blog.\n\n\nPC players can begin playing the Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition on March 21. If you've yet to check out Forbidden West, you should. It's pretty great. \n\nThe post Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition ventures onto PC in March appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "While I wouldn't say I'm bad at games by any stretch, I know a game I'll be bad at when I see one. NanoApostle is one such game, and the frenetic boss rush actioner from developer 18Light Game (Pronty) is due out on PC in summer 2024. \n\n\nWho cares if I'll be bad at it, though. You might not be! It certainly seems exciting enough, and the intense boss battles at its core are on full display in the announcement trailer from publisher PQube. \n\n\n\n\nNanoApostle puts you in the role of a nanomachine-augmented child named Anita. As she attempts to escape a top secret facility, she comes face to face with a bunch of cybernetic experiments that certainly seem to have \"gone wrong.\" Or maybe they've gone exactly as their creator intended? Either way, she has to beat 'em all up using a \"Destruction Point\" battle system. As the name implies, this involves using Anita's Apostle nanites to identify structural weaknesses in enemies and land decisive hits.\n\n\nDestined to die\n\n\nThe stages themselves are something you'll have to contend with, too. Some of the environments will warp and advance as bosses become more aggressive. As one might expect from a game like NanoApostle, it results in the need for a lot of well-timed dodging and parrying. You'll also need to be strategic with the way you utilize skill points to decide upon your personal approach to combat. \n\n\nIt all looks and sounds very cool, even if it smacks of a game that I'll pick up and get frustrated with almost immediately. For a lot of folks, that's a key selling point, and I can't say I'm not immediately drawn in by the promise of any game that falls in the Oops! All Bosses! category a la Furi.

School Idol Festival 2 MIRACLE LIVE! isn't just getting a global launch date; it's also getting a global closure date, at the same time.\n\n\nIn a tweet from the SIF account, the company says it is \"excited to break the news to you that the global version of Love Live! School Idol Festival 2 MIRACLE LIVE! is launching soon in February 2024.\" Then, in the next paragraph: \"However, we also want to inform you that, the Global Version will close its doors on May 31, 2024, and cease in-app purchases accordingly.\"\n\n\n\n\nIt is a little surreal, to see a launch and closure in the same tweet like that. Mobile games spinning up, making their cash, and closing down later isn't exactly news, but doing it all in one fell swoop? Incredible.\n\n\nGrand opening, grand closing\n\n\nAs the text notes, this is the global version specifically. Per Gematsu, the School Idol Festival 2 opened its doors in Japan for iOS and Android on April 15, 2023. It's also closing earlier than the global version, on March 31, 2024. So while the global version won't make it three months, the game as a whole will not have made it a full year on either version.\n\n\nPart of me has to wonder whether this is due to some sort of obligation, that the global version is even going live at all. Or maybe this is just the most nihilistic take on mobile gacha games yet.\n\n\nThe games industry has not been easy on anybody lately, so I do have a lot of sympathy for the developers who put work into making something for the Love Live! fans and have to see their work disappear so fast. Maybe a third School Idol Festival will see more time in the light than this particular entry in the Love Live! canon.\n\nThe post New Love Live! mobile game will launch globally in February, then close in May appeared first on Destructoid.",

They join a growing list of layoffs experienced in the industry, which continues to accelerate from last year.\n\n\nBlack Forest Games is a German Developer who was responsible for Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams, Titan Quest, and the recent Destroy All Humans remasters. They are currently working on an adaptation of the comic book mini-series, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Last Ronin.  \n\n\nBlack Forest Games is a subsidiary of THQ Nordic who, in turn, is a subsidiary of Embracer Group, a publisher who was rather central in the mass of layoffs that occurred through 2023. The company spent much of last year cutting back staff throughout all its many subsidiaries, following explosive expansionism and the fall-through of a large investment.\n\n\nA huge contraction of the industry has made this a distressing time for anyone who loves the medium. 2023 was already a huge year for job losses in the industry, while 2024 is already shaping up to be worse. Kotaku is keeping a running tally of video game (and adjacent) layoffs, and by their count, we’re already approaching nearly 6,000 in the first month of the year.\n\n\nIt’s hard to say what our beloved hobby will look like when all of this finally slows down, but it’s rather difficult to stay optimistic.\n\nThe post Black Forest Games reportedly lays off roughly 50% of its employees appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Last year, we reported that Twitch was introducing a new Partner Plus Program, which brought with it changes to how streamers are paid. While it was met with some praise, it was also criticized for certain threshold requirements. As a result, the company has implemented a few changes.\n\n\nIn a recent blog, Twitch announced its updated payouts for Partner Plus. For starters, it's now allowing Affiliated rather than just Partners to be included in the program. The changes also lower the threshold from 350 to 300, which means more streamers can qualify.\n\n\n\n\nWhen the scheme began last October, it adjusted the 50/50 split to a 70/30 one, giving streamers more income. Now, with a lower threshold of 100 Plus Point (presumably this is in relation to how many subscribers channels have), a new Level 1 entry point will give content creators a 60/40 split, while Level 2 retains the 70/30 split.\n\n\nTwitch has received \"clear feedback\"\n\n\nAdditionally, when the Partner Plus Program (which is dropping the \"Partner\" from the name) was first introduced, it put a cap on how much streamers could earn. In a nutshell, anyone whose revenue was $100k or more would go back down to the 50/50 split. This idea has now been scrapped.\n\n\nThe program was met with some backlash from the community, many of whom were concerned that the 350 subscriber threshold was unobtainable for many channels. Add onto that the income cap, and it was not Twitch's finest hour.\n\n\nHowever, judging by responses to its Twitter thread on the news, it seems many are much happier with these new changes that will be coming into effect this May.\n\nThe post Twitch is expanding its Partner Plus Program, dropping the $100k cap appeared first on Destructoid.",

As of the 1.2.0 update that went live on January 24, F-Zero 99 now includes an easier way to play with friends alongside a little surprise for more dedicated players.\n\n\nThe big feature of this update is the Private Lobby. This feature works exactly the way it sounds; any player who has completed the tutorial can now create or join their own private room right from the main menu. Simply select a game mode, enter a passcode, and you're in. \n\n\nYour room will auto-populate with CPU players once the countdown timer ends, so you don't actually need 99 people to make this feature work. Heck, if you just want to race by yourself against bots, you can do that here.\n\n\n\n\nBut what are the secret tracks in F-Zero 99?\n\n\nThe much more enigmatic addition via this patch is the addition of \"secret tracks.\" So far, it appears that tracks titled \"???\" will randomly appear as you play online, complete with glitched-looking level icons. The tracks themselves seem to be mash-ups of existing tracks, with similarly mashed-up music to accompany them. Completing one of these will give you the \"???\" badge.\n\n\n\n\nIf you play enough, you should see one of these courses pop up sooner than later. As of writing, we're still learning more about how what each of these easter egg tracks looks like.\n\n\nAdditionally, update 1.2.0 also increases the max level cap to 399 (with numbers over 100 being marked with stars), and a new maximum skill rating of S50. Also, most importantly, the patch notes for this update state that Nintendo has \"Fixed issues to make for a more pleasant gaming experience.\" Thanks for looking out for the pleasantness of my gaming experience, it means a lot!\n\n\nF-Zero 99 is available now as part of the Nintendo Switch Online service.\n\nThe post F-Zero 99 1.2.0 update adds private lobbies and “secret tracks” appeared first on Destructoid.",

It will arrive on Switch, PlayStation, and Xbox consoles on February 8, 2024.\n\n\nTomás Esconjaureguy previously brought us The Night of the Scissors back in 2022, which sounds like a localization title for Clock Tower. Cannibal Abduction followed in 2023 on PC, where it was self-published by Selewi, Esconjaureguy’s publishing label.\n\n\nAs is standard for cannibal stories and common in horror, Cannibal Abduction has the protagonist, Henry, breaking down while on a road trip. A friendly local stops to give him a tow, and you know how this goes. Henry finds himself on the menu and has to escape before the meal begins.\n\n\n\n\nTo be honest, it sounds rather standard with fixed camera angles, hide-and-seek gameplay, limited inventory, and “soft” puzzle solving. However, the reception to it seems pretty warm.\n\n\nSpeaking of warm reception, while it doesn’t explicitly say it's a compilation in the title, Esconjaureguy’s previous title, The Night of the Scissors, is included in the pricetag. The game has you play as Adam, who breaks into an abandoned post office to rob it, only to find it inhabited by “The Snipper,” who doesn’t take trespassing lightly.\n\n\nIt might be worth noting that by Esconjaureguy’s estimation, Cannibal Abduction will take two hours, while The Night of the Scissors is around 40. I generally prefer my horror games on the shorter side, but it’s something to keep in mind when you look at the price tag, which, at $11.99, is a bit higher than the combined price of the games on Steam.\n\n\nCannibal Abduction is on PC right now, but it’s coming to Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S on February 8, 2024.\n\nThe post Torture Star Video is bringing lo-fi slasher horror Cannibal Abduction to console appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It may be approaching nine years old at this point, but fans of Until Dawn may wish to know that Supermassive's interactive horror game could be coming to PS5 and PC. That's according to at least one report so far.\n\n\nIn a recent story from Billbil-kin over on Dealabs (as translated by IGN), an announcement could be arriving soon regarding a modern port of Until Dawn. It's also possible that the rumored enhanced version of the game has been in development for \"at least a year.\"\n\n\n\n\nAt the time of writing, there's been no official confirmation from developer Supermassive, Sony, or any other company officially associated with the game. What's interesting is this comes just a week after it was revealed Until Dawn was being adapted into a movie.\n\n\nIsn't it basically a \"movie\" already?\n\n\nIf you've never played the game before, it's essentially an interactive slasher film in which you're tasked with navigating characters to safety from a serial killer. It was quite a horror hit when it launched in 2015. Sadly, it was only available on PS4 at the time, so a PlayStation 5 and PC version would be welcomed.\n\n\nWe actually think of it as one of the best horror games from the PlayStation 4 era, up there with the likes of Alien: Isolation and SOMA. Okay, some might not be a fan of its minimal interaction – largely reduced to quick time events – but it was offering something a little different in the genre.\n\n\nAs I said, we don't know whether there will be an enhanced version of the game yet. This is just a rumor, so hopefully we'll get some feedback on whether this is true or not.\n\nThe post Until Dawn may be coming to PS5 and PC, ahead of the feature film appeared first on Destructoid.",

The latest side-scrolling action game from Inti Creates (Azure Striker Gunvolt, Blaster Master Zero) is set to launch on consoles and PC on May 30, 2024.\n\n\nSpecifically, Umbraclaw is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC. A demo is on the way to the February 2024 edition of Steam Next Fest, and you can see how much ass this little cat kicks in the release date trailer below. \n\n\n\n\nUmbraclaw follows a house cat named Kuon, who awakens in the Soulplane after dying in our world. In order to return home, she'll have to brave this realm of the dead, which has a really cool art style to it. While cats do have nine lives, those lives come and go rather easily. Whenever Kuon takes a hit she dies; simple as that. Thankfully, she has an \"Anima Revive\" power that can bring her back to life with a new skill each time, paving the way for different play styles and leading her toward multiple possible endings. \n\n\nSome of those skills are animal transformation skills like the Crow, Tyrannosaurus, and Elephant (take that, Mario). Kuon can also change into a humanoid form for \"full fighting action,\" switching the focus from enemy avoidance to direct combat. Blaster Master Zero director Satoru Nishizawa is at the helm for this one, and hopefully, it's as fun to play as it is to watch. We'll see how the sampler pans out next month ahead of the May launch. We'll also find out more about the other mystery game Inti Creates is working on During PAX East 2024!\n\nThe post Inti Creates’ Umbraclaw proves cats have nine lives AND rad powers, launches this May appeared first on Destructoid.",

You find yourself in a strange underground sewer (at least for as long as I played) and complete typical Resident Evil-style environmental puzzles (it's even got a typewriter to save!). Your objective? To find your dog, named Roy.\n\n\nTo locate the right direction to travel in (even with a lantern it's quite dark) you need to call out for Roy who'll bark back in response.

I'd do it too but I live in an apartment, and as a society, we have rules.\n\n\n\n\nRaising your voice like this to your dog is annoying in real life and it gets no better when you're dealing with a microphone on a controller or the Steam Deck or your laptop that's actually hooked up to a monitor and sits under your desk. \n\n\nYou can avoid some of these problems by pressing a button for your main character to do the yelling for you, but that takes away a key component of the game's identity. The aim was to make a sound-inspired game. On that front, we have an amazingly unpleasant title. \n\n\nIt's also worth mentioning how tiring it is to keep yelling for Roy when you're lost. I'd rather use any of my other main means of communication, even eye-tracking as the game Before Your Eyes does beautifully, than yell at my game. \n\n\nThere'll be some who enjoy this title and its uniqueness. I generally like idiosyncratic titles. Give me an FMV or unique indie any day. But not Rotten Flesh. He's not a good boy. \n\nThe post Rotten Flesh, a new unique horror game, is sadly too annoying to finish appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Yoko Taro’s NieR series has been synonymous with live service crossovers since the release of NieR Automata. Everything from Final Fantasy XIV to Final Fantasy Brave Exvius has seen the likes of 2B make an appearance, so it's tragically ironic that NieR’s own live service game, NieR Reincarnation, is closing its doors soon.\n\n\nAn announcement was posted to the official NieR Reincarnation website confirming that the game will officially end service on April 29, 2024. As a small consolation, NieR Reincarnation will continue to receive updates in the interim. In addition to boosting item drop rates and giving out pulls from its gacha every day, the game’s “The People and the World” story arc will see its final chapter on March 28.\n\n\n\nThis may give some people déjà vu of how Dragalia Lost ended…",

          "description": "Say what you will about the likes of Resident Evil 4, its iconic B-movie cheese means it's a game that doesn't take itself too seriously. However, there's being flippant about certain aspects of your IP and...whatever's going on with this mod.\n\n\nIf you want to see the kinds of things people do to mess about with their favorite games, look no further than Nexus Mods user SupremeLeader777. For some reason, they've decided to take Ada Wong from Resident Evil 4's \"Separate Ways\" DLC and swap out her character model for that of a harbor seal.\n\n\nImage via SupremeLeader777/Nexus Mods.\n\n\nIf there's any rationale behind it, they're not saying so on the download page. The images suggest it's exactly as you would imagine: RE4 Remake with a seal instead of Ada running (flapping?) around the place.\n\n\nYou can almost hear the slapping sounds\n\n\nAs far as I can tell, it's still the same DLC content – still the same game – just you play as a slippery, Arctic mammal instead of the infamous mercenary. If you go through SupremeLeader777's other mods, you'll see this is not the first instance of swapping the vanilla character out for someone (or something) else. It's the appeal of modding, I guess.\n\n\nA couple of days ago, I wrote about how someone has made it possible to play RE4 in first-person without needing a headset. One might argue this is quite a nifty download for anyone who hasn't got – and/or can't afford – VR.\n\n\nThat's not to say anything negative about the Ada Wong/seal mod. Seeing the silly things people in the community do is one of the reasons I love talking about modding. But now all I can think about is whether the harbor seal speaks in Wong's voice, or the audio has been replaced by \"arfs\" instead.\n\nThe post Um…this Resident Evil 4 mod has a harbor seal instead of Ada Wong appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Excitement for Obsidian Entertainment's upcoming action-RPG Avowed has no doubt ramped up since it was shown off at Developer Direct. Since then, some extended footage has been doing the rounds, with an in-depth discussion about the game from its two directors.\n\n\nIn the recent video from the official Xbox podcast, Game Director Carrie Patel and Gameplay Director Gabe Paramo take us through some moments from Avowed's Shatterskarp area. We get a pretty tasty morsel of what's to come from Obsidian's next release (though it needs to be said that all footage is from the alpha build currently).\n\n\n\n\nThe action looks pretty sweet and while the game is not intending to be Skyrim adjacent, I can't help but see a little bit of TES5 in all that sword swinging and shield bashing. I'm here for it, essentially.\n\n\nDoing what Obsidian does best\n\n\nWhile all this high-octane, fantasy action is a key part of the gameplay, there will be plenty of people who'll be interested in how well the story will be written (yo). Obsidian is known for crafting rich worlds with great dialogue options, something which Avowed will likely feature.\n\n\nRemember, this is the same studio that brought us the narrative-rich Pentiment (a game I absolutely fell in love with when I played it). Oh, also something called Fallout: New Vegas. Maybe you've heard of it.\n\n\nIt seems Obsidian Entertainment can't do much wrong at the minute. Whatever genre it dips its toes into, the studio often come up with something that has an equal mix of great gameplay and fantastic writing. Win-win.\n\n\nOn top of that, Avowed will be coming to Xbox Game Pass on launch day. We don't know when it's releasing exactly, but it's expected later this year.\n\nThe post Avowed extended footage shows off sweet, Elder Scrolls-esque combat appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Splatoon 3 fans woke up to big news this morning. After initially being slated for Spring 2024, the second wave of the game's DLC is getting a bump up. It's now scheduled to be released toward the end of next month. \n\n\nSplatoon 3 Sider Order is now confirmed to be heading our way on February 22. It's included as part of the Splatoon 3 Expansion Pass. The pass consists of the already released Inkopolis DLC and the upcoming Sider Order content. The Expansion Pass is currently listed at $24.99.\n\n\n\n\nToday's Side Order release date trailer looks like it purposely evokes a Matrix vibe. We see Agent 8 fall asleep on a train just as the screen starts to glitch. It then quickly becomes overwhelmed by falling symbols that's quite similar to the Matrix series' green coding. We'll have to wait and see whether the sci-fi series is alluded to any further in the upcoming DLC.\n\n\nInkopolis reintroduced the first Splatoon game's main hub as an explorable area. There were some minor changes to the environment, but nothing radical. Side Order looks to be a much meatier piece of new content.\n\n\nSide Order introduces a new location in the Spire of Order. In this single-player campaign, players will experience a challenge tower of sorts. You'll attempt to advance through the Spire of Order's various floors by taking on wave after wave of oncoming enemies. Nintendo says the new content is meant to be played over and over.\n\n\nMore single-player content for the \"superb\" Splatoon 3 is certainly something to be excited about. We'll see how it all comes together on February 22.\n\nThe post Splatoon 3 Side Order DLC arrives near the end of  February appeared first on Destructoid.",

The full pre-recorded performance will be available to stream for free via Nintendo's YouTube channel on February 9. \n\n\n\n\nAccording to the official website, viewers who tune into the concert can look forward to music selections ranging from the first Zelda to Tears of the Kingdom, all performed by a full orchestra. The video is listed as being around 30 minutes in length, and you'll be able to catch it starting at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time right here.\n\n\nThis particular concert was originally scheduled to be performed at the Nintendo Live 2024 TOKYO event, which was canceled due to unspecified threats. The event was planned for January 20 and 21 at Tokyo Big Sight before \"aggressive\" threats were made toward Nintendo staff and attendees. This also resulted in the postponement of national and world championships for Splatoon 3 and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Beyond the concerts, the Nintendo Live 2024 TOKYO event was also going to serve as a showcase for the latest games from Nintendo.  \n\n\nThe Legend of Zelda Orchestra Concert isn't the only event that just announced its rescheduled plans. The Splatoon 3 Deep Cut concert was also lined up for Nintendo Live 2024 TOKYO, and now it will stream via Nintendo's YouTube channel on February 10.

          "description": "Time marches forward, and with it, gaming must also keep itself relevant. A few months back, we talked about how Nintendo was ending online support for two of its now-defunct consoles. A recent update from the company has since narrowed down exactly when that's going to be happening.\n\n\nAs of April 8 – at exactly 4 p.m. PDT – most online services for the 3DS and Wii U will be shut down for good. That's according to a recent Twitter post, which leads to a customer support page that goes into more detail.\n\n\n\n\nThe information says the discontinuation will be for the following: New Nintendo 3DS, New 3DS XL, New 2DS XL, 3DS, 3DS XL, 2DS, Wii U Deluxe, and Wii U Basic. This will affect \"online co-operative play, internet rankings, and data distribution.\" A second tweet says it's possible to \"merge your unused Nintendo eShop balance to your Nintendo Account\" for use on the Switch. Details about that can be found here.\n\n\nA number of caveats\n\n\nWhile the servers themselves are being turned off, Nintendo does say that players \"will still be able to use features and game modes that do not require online communication.\" It also won't be ending the StreetPass feature for now, as that uses local communication and doesn't require online connectivity.\n\n\nFor the time being, you will still be able to update and redownload purchased games, and the service shutdown won't have an immediate impact on Pokémon Bank and Poké Transporter. People should still be able to download update data and redownload purchased software and DLC from the eShop. Again, that can all change in the future.\n\n\nI was honestly surprised online was still supported for the Wii U and 3DS. The latter was discontinued in 2020, while the former's lifecycle was ended back in 2017, almost seven years ago. Shows how much I have my finger on the pulse of outdated Nintendo consoles.\n\nThe post Nintendo to end online play services for 3DS and Wii U on April 8 appeared first on Destructoid.",

It was initially released in November 2023 on PC and Switch.\n\n\nHowl is one that escaped me. When I think back to November, it’s mostly a blur to me, so that’s no surprise. However, it looks interesting from screenshots and the title of the press release reads “critically acclaimed.” That phrase gets stretched pretty far in the PR world, but, sure enough, Opencritic shows a warm reception from the publications that covered it.\n\n\n\n\nThe announcement also describes Howl as folklore turn-based strategy. A strange howling turns anyone who hears it into werewolves. You play as a deaf heroine who is searching to cure it. From the trailer, it looks to be more of a puzzle game than a turn-based strategy title. You plan your moves in six steps, changing positions on the tiled field and completing actions to try and evade or take down enemies. If you’ll forgive the somewhat obscure reference, it reminds me of Trogdor the Board Game.\n\n\nThere are 60 stages through 4 chapters, and you unlock new abilities and upgrades as you progress through the world map. Most striking, however, is the art style, which looks like it’s hand-drawn in a simple storybook style. \n\n\nI’m bringing this up not just to warn PlayStation and Xbox players that it’s now available to their chosen platform but also for anyone else who, like me, might have missed it at first.\n\n\nHowl is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, and PC.\n\nThe post Storybook strategy game Howl has been released on PS5 and Xbox appeared first on Destructoid.",

While the game will continue to receive support until then, its final story campaign will serve as its last big hurrah. \nReincarnation first launched on July 28, 2021 for iOS and Android and takes place within an unspecified point in the Nier timeline. Like the previous titles, Reincarnation is an RPG set within a mysterious prison world called The Cage, with players controlling different protagonists divided across multiple story arcs. The game has also hosted several crossover events with games such as the remake of Nier Replicant, Final Fantasy XIV, and Persona 5.\nThe shutdown news came the same day as the launch of the latest chapter of its final story arc, The People And The World, dubbed Act II: The Return. Check out the trailer below.\n\n\nIn a shutdown notice, Square Enix states, \nUntil service concludes, Square Enix will offer 10 free summons per day, weekly gem gifts, and other perks. Sales of items on the Premium Shop have ceased. You can read the full rollout of final updates and events in Square Enix's blog post. \nFormer editor Jason Guisao was impressed with Nier Reincarnation, hailing it in an opinion piece as one of the strongest mobile titles available, writing that \"Lengthy narratives and skill-based gameplay loops have come in console/PC-ports like Genshin Impact and PUBG Mobile. Nier Reincarnation, however, employs a happy medium. Heartfelt plotlines with striking visuals, Keiichi Okabe’s mesmerizing score, unintrusive microtransactions, and simple, but rewarding, combat controls establish Reincarnation as one of the best console-like games on mobile devices.\"",

          "description": "Nintendo revealed during a Direct last September Splatoon 3's Side Order DLC would be coming to the game sometime in the spring of this year. Now, just a few months later, Nintendo has revealed exactly when: February 22, 2024. That's when Wave 2 of the Splatoon 3 expansion pass, which features Side Order as the star of the show, goes live, and it's when players can explore the Spire of Order, a brand new location. \nNintendo announced this news with a short teaser trailer today that shows Agent 8 sleeping on a train. The teaser then transitions to the Spire of Order where a mysterious voice is calling out to Agent 8. \nCheck it out for yourself below in the Splatoon 3 Side Order DLC release date trailer: \n\n\nFor the uninitiated, Agent 8 is the protagonist from Splatoon 2's Octo Expansion. In Side Order, Agent 8 will meet a new character named Acht, who claims to go \"way back\" with Marina, one of the hosts of Splatoon 2. Marina's co-host, Pearl, seems to make an appearance of sorts in Side Order as a robot that accompanies Agent 8 on their journey. \nWith the Spire of Order devoid of color, Acht gives Agent 8 color chips to modify their abilities, like boosting run speed and increasing damage. It's likely Agent 8's colored ink will be used to bring color back to the spire, too, but we'll have to wait until February 22 to find out. \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer's Splatoon 3 review, and then check out what else is in the Splatoon 3 expansion pass. \nAre you going to check out Side Order next month?

Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.\nJoin Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

The game drops player into a collection of tropical islands inhabited by monsters called Pals that you can catch as your own. Pals can be used in battle or put to work, building structures and mining resources. You can also mow them down with guns. Yes, this game features realistic guns. It's a very strange but, thus far, entertaining experience.\nWatch Marcus Stewart and Alex Van Aken dive into the Xbox version of Palworld from the beginning to see how the game performs in its first incarnation.

The protege of Balrog sports the same psycho powers that M. Bison wielded, but he thankfully isn’t an evil mastermind. That doesn't make him any less brutal, though, and you can watch him clear a subway car full of Mad Gear gang members in the cinematic trailer below. \n\n\nEd joins Street Fighter 6 as the third fighter in the Year 1 character pass alongside the previously released Rashid and A.K.I. (leaving Akuma as the final Year 1 fighter) and will appear in the story-driven World Tour mode too.

It’s a genre that has been gaining traction in recent years, but Ubisoft’s return to the Prince of Persia franchise is one of the best we’ve seen in a long time. It's even managed to make a spot for itself on our list of the Best Metroidvania Games you should make a point to play. \nThe Lost Crown is also notable for the way it advances this game style with novel ideas and mechanics.

What was once a criminally underused design template has become one of the most commonly used formats in games. That’s especially true for indie developers, who seem more than happy to make up for prolonged droughts between actual Metroid and Castlevania titles by concocting their own unique spins on the style. While some 3D games have adopted the formula to success (see: Batman: Arkham Asylum), this list will only highlight 2D-style titles for the sake of clarity.

EW.com also confirmed that though Harrison Ford's likeness will appear in the game, he will be performed by Troy Baker (The Last of Us, Bioshock Infinite).\nThe adventure is called Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and stars Indy in his prime doing what he does best: solve puzzles, explore tombs, and pummel Nazis. Set in 1937 between the events of Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade, Indy is chasing a stolen relic to solve an ancient, globe-trotting mystery. \nLike Machine Games’ modern Wolfenstein games, The Great Circle is a first-person experience.

          "description": "During today's Xbox Developer Direct, Square Enix made a surprise appearance to pull back the curtains on Visions of Mana, the first new mainline game in the franchise in 15 years. Square Enix also revealed Visions of Mana will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC this summer.\nExecutive producer Masaru Oyamada discussed the franchise's history, noting there have been 17 entries across its 30 years of existence. He also points out that what is now the Mana series today actually began as Final Fantasy Adventure in 1991. \n\n\nMana series creator Koichi Ishii also joined this segment of the show to discuss how he has supervised the team on its work and implementation of taking what were originally pixelated monsters and converting them into the 3D monsters players will fight in the game. \nNotably, Visions of Mana is the first Mana game coming to Xbox. Oyamada expressed Square Enix's excitement about this first for the series while diving deeper into its real-time action combat. This real-time action combat is what originally separated Final Fantasy Adventure from the Final Fantasy series, which was strictly turn-based at the time. \nVisions of Mana's combat continues to look great, as does its beautifully vibrant world. Unfortunately, there's still a few months to go until PlayStation, Xbox, and PC players can play it because it's due out sometime this summer. \n\nWhile waiting for its release, check out the Visions of Mana announcement trailer from The Game Awards 2023 last month. \nAre you excited for Visions of Mana?

          "description": "Developer Ninja Theory appeared on Microsoft's Xbox Developer Direct stream to discuss its sequel, Senua's Saga: Hellblade II. The big news from the footage is the game finally has a release date: May 21. Microsoft also confirmed that the game will be a digital-only release.\nThe developer revealed it is in the final months of development and outlined some elements to expect from Hellblade II. Senua is not in as much fear of her voices as she was in the original game, but she is still a Celtic warrior who struggles with psychosis. Like the first game, Ninja Theory is working with professionals like Cambridge's Paul Fletcher to ensure Senua represents an accurate version of someone struggling with complex mental issues.\n\n\nThere are a number of new characters she will interact with. Some will appreciate her perspective and consider her an ally, but others will reject her and consider her an enemy. Like the original game, Hellblade II takes 10th century Iceland (which the developer visited for research), and she is fighting against Vikings who are enslaving her people. Ninja Theory is focused on making the game historically accurate but with an obvious layer of fantasy on top.\nCombat has been overhauled for the sequel, with the game focusing on the fact that Senua is not a superhero. The goal of the combat is to make players feel like they barely survived each encounter, and the gameplay footage of the combat looks brutal.\nNinja Theory ended the stream saying it hopes to \"craft life-changing art with game-changing tech.\" We will determine if the game lives up to that lofty goal on May 21.",

Citizens are born, they die, rulers change, and can be betrayed.” Players control their own castle over multiple generations of rulers, families, and subjects. Decision-making dictates how well your kingdom operates and how content your subjects are; unhappy citizens may plot to overthrow you. \nYour castle can be expanded with new rooms and items, plus workstations for underlings. It appears to feature a turn-based combat system with players equipping heroes with gear to battle enemies and gather resources to grow their kingdom. Though the game's App Store page states that it includes in-game purchases, it is unclear if Castles is free-to-play or not. \nThe Elder Scrolls: Castles has soft-launched in the Philippines and will become available in other regions over the next few months. It is the third mobile game in the series, following The Elder Scrolls: Blades, a traditional RPG, in 2019 and The Elder Scrolls: Legends, a collectible card game, in 2017.",

Trying desperately to prove his species worth as something better than merely meat to be ground into intergalactic fast food burgers.\nThe ScummVM Team is pleased to announce full support for Orion Burger, the classic game by Sanctuary Woods. The engine also adds a few niceties that the original didn't have, such as mouse wheel handling, and using the spacebar to skip walk animations - something the original didn't do properly.\nHelp us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game's logic was all hardcoded, so we really need people to try all sorts of weird actions, and make sure the game handles everything correctly and matches the original implementation. And please take some screenshots along the way.\nNow, luck be with you. And remember, with the aliens cheating on the tests they set up for you, this will be no easy task.\n>",
