Melee, and Metroid Prime for one more happy go, why don’t we dig a little deeper and celebrate the console’s wider and more unusual releases as well? Here we pick out some slightly more obscure imports and curios that often get barged out of the spotlight by Wind Waker, RE4 and the rest...\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

You have the challenge of navigating dangerous timeloop expeditions, and on each trek you can use cards to influence various things. You can give yourself buffs, or even add new enemies and dangers to give you a chance to earn more loot on the loop.

It's coming to Playstation 4, Playstation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S and PC in 2022. Yes, the big missing platform is Stadia Switch. We're not sure why, frankly, there's nothing in that trailer that highlights it as a game that can't run on Nintendo's system, and it is coming to Microsoft and Sony's last-gen systems.

After meeting a few of the local residents, he makes his way to a run-down — yet remarkably spacious — settlement that he managed to bag for a bargain. The only downside, of course, is that it happens to be haunted.\nThe quirky, yet rather bloated opening segment of the game is a good indication of how the rest of the experience will play out. After spending his first night at his new abode, Zest is tasked with growing his own produce, building machinery, and cooking delicious meals with his own home-grown ingredients.

But a lot of players have one major grievance: the battle pass is a massive grind. Complaints about challenges that award very little XP are all over the game's subreddit. Fortunately, the devs have seen this feedback, and are already looking into the slow progression. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "There’s something about Call Of Duty: Vanguard and its multiplayer modes that feels thin. Much like my time with the game’s campaign, I’m left wanting. This is a World War II veneer glossed over a Modern Warfare canvas, with familiar pacing and shooting, but ultimately lacking the weight of Infinity Ward’s reboot.\nAs a Call Of Duty multiplayer experience, Vanguard delivers. But what it delivers is a stop-gap. An FPS experience that isn’t concerned with pushing the series forwards, or taking risks. Fans will have fun, sure, but its deathmatches and dominations are stuck in the past. Not to mention Zombies, which is too eager to turn back the clock.\nRead more",

As you rotate, prod and investigate its five little vignettes to line-up matching bits of scenery in one tile to affect the corresponding bit in another, Optillusion's debut game harks back to the best bits from Fireproof Studios' The Room series. It's a beautifully crafted little thing, and it builds on its ideas to create some genuinely standout moments of optical wizardry.

Young Holmes returned to Cordona to find out how his mum died a decade ago, and is helped by his best mate Jon, this season's Creepy Watson. Boy, do they get in some scrapes along the way! Bingo, bango, there's yer preamble.\nBut the complex explanation is that this game, ironically, defies explanation. As I played, I oscillated wildly between thinking, \"This is Frogwares' world and we're all just living in it!\" and, \"What is even happening, what is this, I need a ten-part documentary series that just follows the developers around because they really have a lot of explaining to do.\"\nRead more",

          "description": "Morse, the strategy game that teaches you real morse code to win a war, has come a long way since we first wrote about it in 2015. What started out as a free flash game (and a makeshift telegraph key made out of a clothes peg) now has proper 3D graphics and quite possibly the most impressive custom controller setup I've ever seen. When I played the demo at EGX 2021 last month, not only had creator AlexVSCoding made an entire telegraph machine for the occasion, but he'd also managed to source a pair of headphones from the 1930s to really hammer home the idea of being a wartime telegraph operator. \nObviously, you don't need a pair of 90-year-old headphones to enjoy playing Morse. A modern headset will do just as well. You also don't technically need the telegraph machine either, as there's an onscreen button interface you can click with your mouse. But let me tell you, pressing those morse code buttons in-game wasn't half as immersive as tapping out the commands on a proper dedicated machine, and I wish there was some way Morse could give everyone that experience when it finally launches in full.\nRead more",

No matter how much you try and tell me about the sweet satisfaction you feel after finally beating a boss on the 57th attempt, I've come to realise I simply don't have the time or the patience to see it through. I'm not sure I ever will, either. \nIt's the same reason I tend to veer away from a lot of other Soulslike games as well. I never really got on with Dead Cells, for instance, and don't even get me started on Sekiro. But cor, I do also love it when a game proves me wrong.

From its music, to the quotations scattered on its loading screens, to the great steaming swamp of Jeff Goldblum voice acting, it’s a solid case study in how a studio can get its money’s worth from an expensive license. And at its heart, of course, is a stable of spectacular dinosaurs.\nUsing lessons learned from Planet Zoo’s development, which has more or less filled the time since 2016’s Jurassic World Evolution, Frontier have come back with the most beautiful, the most real dinosaurs ever to trudge and honk their way across a monitor. It’s proper John Hammond, spared-no-expense, sunglasses-off-and-gawp stuff. Which makes it all the more painfully frustrating to realise that they’re trapped, once again, in a seriously wonky management game. \r\n\n \nRead more",

When the rules of a mystery - what the investigator can and cannot do, who and what was where and when - are laid out clearly for the audience, working within those limitations to puzzle out the case (a la any book by Agatha Christie, the who-dun-it queen) becomes irresistible.\r\n\n\nConway: Disappearance At Dahlia View knows exactly what its story, and its protagonist specifically, can and cannot do. Robert Conway can use his decades of experience as a private investigator to look for missing child Charlotte May Morgan, but what he cannot do is leave Dahlia View or get caught by the police. From his wheelchair, Conway surveys his neighbours from the window of his second-floor flat, occasionally venturing down into the quiet courtyard below to infiltrate his neighbour’s homes. Though due to the declines of age or sheer arrogance, he does neither half so subtly as he’d like to think.\r\n\n\r\nWithin these parameters, Conway presents a classic locked room mystery, only the “room” is the neighbourhood of Dahlia View and, unbeknownst to Conway but made known to the audience, this has all happened before.\r\n\n \nRead more",

One of the few games to understand this is Sea Of Thieves, home to some of the prettiest virtuawater you ever did see, while so many others neglect their duty to show me pretty fake water. So today I'm delighted to see that the next big World Of Warships update brings a graphics overhaul including pretty new water. It is pretty! Not Sea Of Thieves-grade pretty, but certainly a better use of resources than goggles.\nRead more",

I know it seems like I only wrote one of these Letters From The Editor five minutes ago, but that five minutes ago was also about three weeks later than it should have been last month, hence the slight double whammy of RPS Treehouse business you’re getting now. But it’s a good thing, really, as my accidental tardiness last month means I can now address some of the issues you raised in our recent RPS reader survey much faster. We’re still digging through a lot of the results right now, but I thought I’d take this opportunity to talk about some of the more general concerns and proposals you mentioned as part of your overall feedback, and how we’re going to be incorporating some of them into our editorial plans going forward. \nRead more",

It doesn't have much to do with From Software’s upcoming action-RPG Elden Ring, but there's one simple lyric in it that perfectly sums up my early hands-on time with the game’s upcoming closed network test: “Caution, I’ll approach you with a business mind / Slight two step as I check the time”.\nFor three days last week, I practically waltzed over to my friend's PS5 (that I, err, 'borrowed', as sadly Elden Ring's closed network test isn't available on PC this time around). If you applied for the CNT and got selected, you'll be able to experience everything I'm about to tell you for yourself starting this Friday, November 12th, until Monday November 15th. But even though my hands-on with Elden Ring was brief, I’m confident that this is Souls taking a step in the right direction. It’s at once new and familiar, but forever exciting. I want to go back.\nRead more",

It's perhaps one of the more interesting video game movies ever released. Not narratively or stylistically, but rather in the shoes it has to fill. Welcome To Raccoon City is a complete reimagining of the Resident Evil world for the big screen, coming off the heels of Paul W.S. Anderson's Resident Evil film series, which ran for six movies, netting more than a billion dollars in box office revenue. \nWhere Anderson took the Resident Evil source material and made his own science fiction universe, Welcome To Raccoon City – directed by Johannes Roberts (47 Meters Down, The Strangers: Prey At Night) – sticks far closer to the first two games in the series.

If you’ve been waiting to try your hand at the looping adventure or simply want to take it on the go, December 9 is the date to look out for.\nFor those unfamiliar with Loop Hero, it has a unique premise. To save the world from destruction, a hero roams a looping track filled with monsters and other hazards. However, you don’t control your hero directly; instead, you create the world in which he’ll explore. By strategically placing a variety of creatures, terrain types, and obstacles, your auto-moving hero grows stronger with every baddie slain. The key is to throw just enough at the hero to increase its strength without accidentally overwhelming them and causing their demise. In between runs, you'll build up a settlement with different shops to unlock equipment and buffs to increase your odds for the next loop.\nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nLoop Hero is one of those titles best played yourself to truly understand its hooks. In our review of the PC version, we scored the game an 8.5 out of 10. Reviewer Dan Tack noted that “Loop Hero is a creative and clever little game that should be on your radar if you enjoy strategy, RPGs, deckbuilders, roguelikes, or all of the above. While its novelty begins to wither the further you get away from your opening hours, the journey is worthwhile and engaging.”\nLoop Hero is priced at $14.99 but you can pre-order it on the eShop now for a 10% discount ($13.49).",

However, the project was rightfully criticized for the developer’s decision to alongside the CIA to publish the game, with many calling it propaganda.

It also revealed that it hopes to go beyond simply presenting another shooter and instead show the realities of war and its consequences.

It looks pretty identical to a standard Mario Kart split-screen mode, except it’s your living room on the screen rather than Bowser’s Castle. \nIf two players aren’t enough, you can bring in two more thanks to Mario Kart Live’s new Relay Race mode. In this mode, two players will be on one kart, and they can swap control of the wheel back and forth, meaning up to four people can play at once. Three new courses have been added: Windmill Meadows, Music Broadway, and King Boo’s Courtyard. Plus, Luigi’s Poltergust is now a customization item available for use alongside the Spooky Horn.

Eidos recommends this feature to users with a VRR (variable refresh rate) display and warns that some framerates may be unstable in certain areas. \nMeanwhile, base PlayStation 4 players can enjoy an overall performance boost. Eidos even tweaked the sensitivity for the visor to register inputs from older, more worn-down controllers. \nThe patch also adds the following improvement across all versions of the game:\nSave Rollback: A hidden Save Rollback feature was added to allow users who have encountered blocking issues to rollback to the start of the chapter of their choice\nGeneral stability improvement on all platforms\nMultiple stability improvements with Ray Tracing enabled\nGeneral improvements to objective markers\nAdditional improvements to world boundaries\nPC players can expect the patch as early as Friday, November 19. Furthermore, Eidos has also squashed several bugs, the full list of which you can view on the developer's Reddit post. \nFor more on Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, be sure to check out our full review of the game here.

The official Monster Hunter Twitter account posted a one-minute video today featuring the groovy basslines you’ve come to expect from Sonic music alongside footage of palico Sonic and palamute Tails in-game. \nOH YEAH! @Sonic_Hedgehog collaboration coming in FAST!\n#MHRise players starting November 26. pic.twitter.com/7yu9vyN8Et\nNovember 17, 2021\nLook, I’m not Sonic expert but I have to be honest: palico Sonic works so much better than palamute Tails. The palico actually looks like the blue dude who likes to go fast – you could convince me that’s just actually him. The palamute, however, looks like a dog that someone’s dressed up to be like Tails. I don’t know if any of this matters to players – it probably doesn’t – but if I’m going for the full gold rings experience, I’m rolling with Sonic. \nIt’s cool regardless that both are in-game; it's even cooler that the palico can seemingly turn into Super (Saiyan) Sonic too. \nAs noted in the announcement video, this Monster Hunter Rise x Sonic The Hedgehog collaboration will go live on November 26. That day, an event quest will go live and it yields not just the palico and palamute armor pieces as rewards, but some Hunter armor as well. Complete this quest and your entire squad can roll out at the speed of sound in style. This collaboration will hit the PC version when it launches in January. \nWhile waiting for this collaboration to go live, check out Game Informer’s Monster Hunter Rise review and then read where Monster Hunter Rise ended up on this year’s Game Awards nomination list.

The future of the Judgment series, however, is not so guaranteed. As noted by VGC, after an alleged dispute between Sega and lead actor Takuya Kimura’s talent agency, it’s unclear if the series even has its leading actor to rely on for the role of Takayuki Yagami. \nYokoyama said RGG “will continue to cherish the Judgment series” when talking to Famitsu, so that’s something. Only time will tell what comes of it, but now we know a new franchise is in the works at the studio.\nWhile waiting to learn more about it, check out Game Informer’s Lost Judgment review and then read Game Informer’s Yakuza: Like a Dragon review.

Perhaps Sheeran will actually become a canonical Pokémon. I mean, it's not that far off in a world where we have Pokémon that are ya know, keychains.

The game, then scheduled for a 2020 release, blew away my already-high expectations. I enjoyed the original Dying Light, but felt that with a little bit of iteration and polish, the series could evolve into something truly special. Those hopes were delivered upon during that E3 2019 demo, and Dying Light 2 skyrocketed up my list of the most anticipated games of 2020.\nSadly, in the early stages of last year, Techland announced a delay to 2021.

Developer Techland's ambitious open-world title has the potential to wow players with meaningful choices, a beautiful space to cause chaos, and satisfying zombie slaying. While Dying Light 2 has stayed in the shadows for the majority of the last few years, today, we're giving you a new look into this undead nightmare.\nThat's right, join Brian Shea and Alex Stadnik as they take you on a tour of Techland's next title. The aforementioned Mr. Shea got to go to his first in-person press event in two years to get hands-on with both the PS4 Pro version of the game along with the beefed-up PC version.\nDuring today's fresh episode of New Gameplay Today, the gents show off Dying Light 2's improved combat system and discuss how the game has improved since the original. They also dive into the famous parkour and detail how players will be able to use new gear like the paraglider to help them get around the expansive and terrifying open world. We also dive into a bit of the story, including what actor Rosario Dawson's character will be doing, but nothing that would overtly spoil any major story beats. The duo unpacks a lot more, but you're going to have to watch the latest NGT to learn more.\nIf you enjoyed our latest look at Dying Light 2 Stay Human, be sure to check out Brian Shea's written impressions of his time with Techland's latest title ahead of its February 4, 2022 release date!

According to Video Games Chronicle, 343’s popular FPS space opera amassed over 270,000 concurrent players on Steam, the first Xbox Studios game to reach such notable player-count heights in such a short period. \nThis feat is even more impressive when considering the surprise announcement (sure, rumors might’ve been circulating over the weekend) during yesterday’s 20th Anniversary stream. While progression carrying over to the base game – acquired cosmetics, battle pass unlocks, and general experience points – and the Halo namesake are central selling points, it was hard to gauge where the player-count numbers would wind up. Yet (as seen below), other acclaimed Xbox Studios titles like Forza Horizon 5 and Halo: The Master Chief Collection, while very successful in their own right, have not seen the same immediate success on Steam. \nHalo Infinite is now the first ever Xbox Studios Game to pass 200k+ concurrent players on Steam and set the all-time record\npic.twitter.com/IRqKU67MKY\nNovember 15, 2021\nHalo Infinite is in good company, having the fourth largest player peak on Monday under Steam heavyweights like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Dota 2, and PUBG. Developer 343 Industries has a lot to be happy about. \nTotals on Xbox and the PC app haven’t been confirmed yet. Still, it’s safe to assume that the latest multiplayer installment in the Halo franchise is being enjoyed by a bevy of players on all available platforms. With news of the Season One battle pass extending until next May – an unorthodox amount of time, quite frankly – fans should have a ton of additional content rollouts to supplement the already-strong multiplayer and upcoming singleplayer component. \nHalo Infinite launches for Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC on December 8.\nWhat platform have you been playing the beta on?
