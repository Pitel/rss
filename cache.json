          "description": "The battle for Holiday sales is about to begin.\nNintendo can't be accused of being reactive with the Switch ahead of the fast approaching Holiday season. In a time where sales and demand remain strong, the big N has been lining up a steady flow of varied games to keep the console on the wider gaming public's agenda. There are major first-party titles like Metroid Dread and Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl on the way, along with family-centric offerings like Mario Party Superstars and Big Brain Academy: Brain vs. Brain. Add in Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp and some intriguing third-party contributions, and there's plenty to keep the system in the headlines.\nNintendo's also made a move on Switch pricing by reducing the cost of the standard model, but at present this is only in Europe. It's seemingly an adjustment to account for the upcoming OLED model but also the imbalances caused by currency conversions, in which Europeans were comparably paying significantly more for the hardware than North American consumers. Clearly with that in mind, along with its plans for stock levels, the price cut makes sense — it's possible the prices will remain locked in North America and Japan, but of course we'll keep an eye out for updates.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Make sure to give it a go if you haven't played already (full details can be found below).\n\nOriginal Article (Mon 6th Sep, 2021 10:20 BST): Daemon X Machina was a pretty big deal when it arrived in September 2019, earning some loyal fans and even getting its own themed Hori Split Pad Pro - which, by the way, are extremely good hefty alternatives to Joy-Cons. It may not be one of the biggest selling titles on Switch, but it certainly helped add to the sense of Nintendo's hardware getting varied and interesting releases.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

These two minigame-focused mash-ups took famous scenes or sections from popular NES titles and gave them a WarioWare-style spin, and both went down rather well in terms of critical response.\nSadly, it seems they didn't go down well enough for Nintendo to give us more in the 'Remix' line, with the company stating in 2014 that the success of the series depended on fan support. As much as we'd love to have seen a SNES Remix by now, it seems that Nintendo's focus has shifted and, at the time of writing, another instalment isn't on the cards.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It is a full-blown action-comedy with a double jump. You get a sideways dash and a gun that splits to become two, smaller guns. If I see anyone trying to be too smart about this game, in which a time-looping assassin tries to break free of hilarious eternity by murdering many people who deserve it, I will look at them with hollow eyes and say: \"In Deathloop you regularly snap necks by 270 degrees.\" Turn away, poets and stealth likers.

I was also just three-years-old then, but that's besides the point. Instead, we had to wait another decade until it got a proper UK release, where it landed on the original PlayStation in 2002. However, because I was young and naive and far too wrapped up playing Final Fantasies VII-IX at that point, it never even occurred to me to look back down the Roman numeral line and pick it up. Heck, I even missed its appearance on the GBA in 2006 - arguably the last 'best' version of this early 90s classic. It wasn't until the 3D Remake arrived on the Nintendo DS in 2008 that I finally sat up and took notice - a whole 17 years after it first came out. \nBut cor, I'm glad I did, because Final Fantasy IV is still arguably one of the best Final Fantasy games ever made, and is easily the best (or second best, depending on who you ask) of the older retro ones. If there's one Final Fantasy game you make time for over the next few months, make it FFIV. \nRead more",

          "description": "Whenever a new Life Is Strange game comes out I sometimes wonder how my life would manifest as an ironic and metaphorical super power. I usually stop quite quickly, because I have a feeling the answer would be somewhat disappointing. In the first game, Max Caulfield discovered she could rewind time or travel back to the past via photographs. In Life Is Strange 2, we shaped the outlook of young Daniel Diaz and how he used his somewhat fraught telekinetic powers. Now, in Life Is Strange: True Colors, we step into the shoes of Alex Chen, who can step into the hearts and minds of others.\nAlex is a 21-year-old product of the foster system who can feel, manipulate or even absorb the intense emotions of those around her. We join Alex just as she steps off the bus into a remote Colorado mining town called Haven Springs to start a new life with her brother Gabe. Things - as they typically do during weddings in soap operas, the opening ten minutes of a hospital drama, or the end of the first chapter of a Life Is Strange game - go terribly wrong. What follows is simultaneously my most and least favourite Life Is Strange game.\nRead more",

These are the JRPGs that make me wonder why the protagonist wears a heavy, half-broken mask that probably screws with his peripheral vision.

This hard-hitting semi-automatic Sniper Rifle hearkens back to the Barret .50s of the original Modern Warfare trilogy and is a ton of fun in Warzone. It fills an entirely unique niche in the Sniper Rifle class, splitting the difference in bullet velocity between extreme range kings like the ZRG and faster-handling weapons like the Swiss K31.\nHowever, the M82 is also semi-automatic, which makes it a touch more forgiving than any of these alternatives. With one-shot potential and quick follow-ups to missed headshots, the M82 is perhaps the most underrated Sniper Rifle in Warzone.
