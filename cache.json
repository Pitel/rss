          "description": "\"Flying used to be fun until I started doing it for a living\".\nKiki’s Delivery Service is a movie all about growing up. The night Kiki leaves home to complete a year of witch training, she excitedly overstuffs her bag, makes herself a broomstick that’s too small for her, and crashes into a couple of trees during her flight. She doesn’t have a speciality or skill, and upon arriving in the town of Koriko, she causes a ruckus by stopping traffic. Yet this all serves to set up Kiki’s growth, and the pain of becoming an adolescent and – eventually – an adult. She finds her place in the world, living above a bakery, delivering goods on her broomstick, and overcomes her fears to become the best version of herself.\nKiki is the heart of Studio Ghibli’s 1989 coming-of-age story, and it’s her brashness, positivity, and determination that has clearly rubbed off on Mika, the star of Chibig’s latest game, Mika and the Witch’s Mountain. There’s no greater influence here than the aforementioned movie; the premise of playing a witch delivery game with cel-shaded visuals and sprawling seas inspired by The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker was enough to smash through its Kickstarter goal. Yet, two years after the potion was brewed, we’re left with a game that has flashes of the heart of the Studio Ghibli classic, but is sadly completely forgettable in almost every single respect.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It’s permissive and demanding; playful and tense. Its globe-spanning plot covers conspiracies, PMCs, and brutal theocratic dictatorships. It also features a traffic-summoning warlock named Steve wearing a hi-vis robe. It’s finding that one absolutely, perfectly ridiculous XCOM turn, every turn…and at the same time knowing it’s absolutely, perfectly fine if you don’t. In short: it’s one of the most enjoyable tactics games I’ve ever played, and the only tactics game with a pyromancer so rubbish he relies on making his enemies pass out from heatstroke.\nRead more",

They've also shared a little about why it's taken so long to arrive - the (generally decent) action-RPG hit PS5 over a year ago, back when I was still some filthy console-playing freelancer.\nAccording to director Hiroshi Takai, it was \"impossible\" to create the PC and PS5 versions at the same time, even if Square Enix hadn't been restrained by a timed exclusivity clause. He also thinks that the Final Fantasy series faces no \"existential risk\" right now, despite lower-than-hoped returns from both Final Fantasy 16 and, going by Square Enix's latest financial reports, the more recent and currently PS5-only Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.\n Read more",

Developed well over two decades ago, the original Silent Hill 2 is the magnum opus of Polish horror stalwarts Bloober Team. Running on then-innovative \"Unreal Engine 5\" technology created by Jazz Jackrabbit publishers Epic MegaGames, it's a wonderful abyss of a game that remains perfectly playable today, given a certain amount of tolerance for the quirks of the era.\nIt begins with your character, James Sunderland, descending from the road towards the eponymous Midwestern nowhere-town. Like many games of the period, Silent Hill 2 uses a third-person, over-the-shoulder manual camera, which allows you to glance fearfully up at the monstrous pine trees that fringe the path - each rising from a bulging tide of fog that menaces with the suggestion of approaching figures. There is moisture everywhere, gushing from drain pipes and dribbling down concrete barriers. As you amble into the murk, deathly chords and groaning, unmechanical motifs reverberate from somewhere deep underground. \r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "One of the best roguelikes on PC is getting a farewell of sorts this week. Twitchy slashfest Dead Cells received its final major update, introducing new enemies, fresh weapons, and a few mutations. Unfortunately, all this new stuff is very cursed. In other words, it all toys with the game's \"curse\" status effect, a hex that causes you to be killed if you take even a single hit. You'll probably die a few times as a result of this update, which in some ways is a fitting finalé for this fast-paced jar smasher of a game. You can see the new features in the trailer below. \nRead more",

          "description": "Last week, the Xitter account for H2M - a mod aiming to recreate the heyday of classic Modern Warfare 2 multiplayer inside Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered - announced that they had received a cease and desist from Activision Blizzard, and would shut down the project. The 2022 version of Modern Warfare 2 lacked the original’s multiplayer, and H2M was so highly-anticipated that Steam sales of the 2016 FPS balooned in the lead-up to the mod’s planned release date. It didn't hurt that Activision had it on sale, of course, but the timing lined up so well that some fans speculated the discount was a deliberate bait-and-switch on the publisher’s part to profit from excitement over a mod they were already planning to shut down.\nRead more",

          "description": "When Bloober and Konami announced that they were remaking Silent Hill 2 as part of a comprehensive series reboot, it made immediate if slightly deflating sense to me. Silent Hill 2 is the more feted of the Hills - if I were a calculating franchise custodian tasked with 'bringing back' one of the acclaimed original trilogy, that's probably the instalment I and my spreadsheets would fix upon. I mean, it's the game with Pyramid Head in it - the nearest thing Silent Hill has to a mascot, and it's not like there's an issue of cutting out plot material: each game in the Silent Hill series is, on some level, a distinct story with a distinct protagonist.\nStill, the decision to 'skip' the first game in the series, whose world, narrative themes, music and art direction set the parameters for all the rest, made my brain itch a bit, and when I ran into Bloober's creative director Mateusz Lenart and lead producer Maciej Głomb at a Konami event, I had to ask about it. \r\n \nRead more",

What a perfect time, then, to dive into the alpha demo for vampire management game Blood Bar Tycoon, especially since Two Point seem to be resting on their laurels a bit too comfortably for my liking.\nThe idea here is you build a swanky bar serving claret cosmopolitans, ichor-ish coffees and uh, viscera vampiros to your undead clientele. But (with the sorta exception of the crimson-sapped Dracaena cinnabari) blood doesn’t grow on trees, so you’ll also be moonlighting as a human-nabber. You’ll research a slew of “whacky contraptions” to extract their blood, which I greatly enjoy, because “zany exsanguination” is a real winner of a feature.

          "description": "The next advance in video game graphics technology is not ray-tracing or tray-racing or any variation thereof - it's janky stop motion and rubbish plastic dolls, and it actually began about 30 years ago, when I watched the Adam and Joe show for the first time. If you never watched the Adam and Joe show, they used to do home movie recreations of famous films like Titanic and Saving Private Ryan using stuffed animals and action figures. I found these \"Toymovies\" hysterical as a kid - I suspect they are less so now. Probably, they are full of jokes we might tentatively class as \"of their time\". The point is, Reptilian Rising is sort of Toymovie: The Game. \n Read more",

It's 2D pixel art, with a limited colour palette as in EGA games, and you control it with a text parser, like King's Quest or one of them other Sierra adventures old men like Graham remember. It's important to mention this up front because it's very possible that, despite The Crimson Diamond's tale of betrayal, murder, and mineral rights in 1914 Canada, the text parser element will be a Rubicon you instantly can't be arsed to cross. A not unreasonable stance - though I think the text parser in The Crimson Diamond is fantastic. Such beef that I have with this adventure game is down to the specificity required to solve some of the puzzles.\nRead more",

Multiplayer shooty Helldivers 2 is still sitting around 35,000 concurrent players, which is perfectly respectable, if only around 10% of its peak back in April. Still, a clutch of disgruntled ‘divers have recently found a novel way to protest an increasingly unpopular series of nerfs: laying down their guns and letting the bots take the damn planet.\n“If Super Earth wanted to remain safe, they would stop nerfing our guns,\" reads one comment on the subreddit, in response to a post titled “Let the bots advance. Let the Super Earth burn.” It seems to have picked up some steam inside the actual game, too. As of earlier this week, there’s only around a thousand players actively trying to stop the bots advancing perilously close to the home planet, via Gamesradar.\nWhether this is all massively overblown for the sake of a dramatic yarn or not, Arrowhead themselves have taken note of player concerns over nerfs. Yesterday, game director Mikael Eriksson unveiled a plan for the next 60 days, directly addressing player feedback over the controversial ‘Escalation of Freedom’ update.\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Aside from being a game where you run around a shopping mall murdering the living dead, the original Dead Rising from 2006 is a clownish satire of sleazy tabloid photojournalism. It expresses this by way of its scoring system, where you earn \"Prestige points\" for snapping pictures that fit one of five categories: \"Brutal\" scenes of characters being slain; moments of \"Horror\", such as the spectacle of an approaching horde; comical \"Outtakes\", like characters caught in bizarre poses; moments of \"Drama\", such as people reacting to discoveries; and \"Erotic\" photos of women alive or undead, which range from snaps of exposed underwear to close-ups of cleavage.\nThe Erotica tag has, however, been chopped from the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, in what Capcom gingerly suggest isn't \"a response to a changing cultural climate\", but expressive of the view that earning points from such photos is not \"an appropriate reward for survival and not a skill required of a journalist trying to stay alive\".\n Read more",

The Deck’s compatibility issues aren’t nearly as issue-some as they were at launch, but between its Linux-based SteamOS and its relatively mild processing power, but it is true that beefier Windows handhelds will more likely cater to your entire cross-launcher library.\nUnless, that is, you get something else to run them for you. Streaming games on the Steam Deck has emerged as a nifty workaround for the portable PC’s lingering compatibility woes, making even officially unsupported games playable. Usually with much better performance, too, as the actual rendering work is done remotely – what you see on the Deck’s screen is basically a video feed of that remote device’s display output, with your control input beamed the other way via a low-latency connection. And because you’re not using SteamOS or the internal hardware to actually run the game, it’s not bound by their limits.\nRead more",

Doing this requires you to stand upright in full view, with your back turned upon an entire space station's worth of shiny domed technology and guttural industrial noises. Delightful!\nAmongst the players harrowed and compelled by this fixture is Fede Álvarez, director of the 2013 Evil Dead remake, 2016's Don't Breathe and, most recently Alien: Romulus - the seventh and avowedly \"back to basics\" Alien movie. Isolation is the Alien experience that convinced Álvarez the Alien could still be scary, after decades of milking the creature's dugs for spin-off movies and making it share a screen with the Predator, the Pepsi Max to Alien's Dom Pérignon 1921. In possibly self-defeating homage to Creative Assembly's work, he's filled the movie with Emergency Telephones, turning them into a straightforward-sounding form of foreshadowing.\n Read more",

One of these new features is a built-in browser for mods, and support for many existing mods that previously required a different version of the game. Basically, lots of good fan-made mods are now playable on the Steam version of ye olde Doom. That's neat! Ah, but there is some demon excrement on the health pack, so to speak. The mod browser lacks moderation and lets people upload the work of others with their own name pinned as the author. That's prompted one level designer to call it \"a massive breach of trust and violation of norms the Doom community has done its best to hold to for those 30 years.\" \nRead more",

          "description": "You're a long time undead. 7 Days To Die was shuffling along in early access for 11 years, until version 1.0 finally burst through the windows. In that time, many other survival games have sprouted, blossomed, and gently faded away. I first visited the burnt-out ruins of this zombie-infested world a decade ago and I returned to it this week to find a tree-puncher that, despite bearing the pockmarks of early access, retains much of what made it enjoyable back when the survival genre was still wearing its baby onesie. Instead of a review, I figured I'd scribble together a mini starter guide for new (or returning) players. Partly because the game is a proper time sink and it was taking me so long to get through everything. But mostly because I wanted to use that numberful headline. So, here you go: 7 dos and 7 don'ts in 7 Days To (7) Die.\nRead more",

Khaligrad is plenty scrappy. Its edges are rough and you have to figure it out yourself, but it's more intuitive than it appears, and easy to operate once you discern some basics. It's scrappy too in that it's, well. It's Stalingrad. Not really: its world is so fictional it's their 15th century. But the invaders are explicitly fascists and the defenders communists embroiled in a long and brutal semi-guerrilla city war with World War 2 technology. Thankfully, it's stripped of any actual fashy or genocidal play-acting beyond each side doing \"hail the empire/union\" bits as a sign off.\nI think that's why, despite its brutal and difficult setting, it's this year's entry in the long tradition of Low-Intensity Strategy Games For When Hot Why Hot Please Stop You Cannot See My Begging Tears For They Evaporate.\nRead more",

The supermarket chain – third biggest in the UK by turnover and purveyors of ill-fitting clothes and surprisingly good doughnuts alike – has added light-up gaming mice, keyboards, and headsets to its mountain of own-brand wares.\nAsda being what it is (Americans, if you’re unfamiliar, think Walmart with less gun violence), it’s all dirt cheap as well. £17 for a full-size keyboard. £16 for an FPS mouse. Overwhelmed with curiosity, I ended up taking home a complete starter set (keeb, different mouse, headset, and mousemat) for £45, or about a third of the price of the Logitech G515 Lightspeed TKL that I’d shortly kick off my desk. Could this be a new frontier in affordable PC hardware, bringing tech to the masses in a way no specialist retailer ever could, or should supermarkets stick to cereal and meal deals?

Aside from a not-so-subtle hint that the orcs, ogres, and Khorne pack would feature at least one colossal squig, it also ended with a tease at smaller bits of new content coming alongside regular patches. As of the game’s latest hotfix blog, we’ve now got a better idea when we’ll start seeing some of these “smaller bits and pieces.” Bits and pieces? In this economy? Yes, and this month in fact. “Late August” to be precise by quoting a vague statement precisely.\nRead more",

The game festering beneath is actually a \"plant horror\" boss rusher with twin stick melee controls, unlockable \"Instinct\" abilities and one-hit deaths.\nIn a gift to headline writers everywhere, the developers, four-person Gardenfiend Games, are calling it \"Hollow Knight meets Titan Souls\", and who am I to deny them? It's got one of those \"painterly\" art styles, too, though other words come to mind, such as \"rotted\" and \"unhallowed\" and \"manky\". It's out on 6th September.

Leaves flutter, rays of sun cavort through trees, and the music is utterly gorgeous. The game opens on twinkly piano and mournful strings, infused with a good dose of stirring JRPG whimsy, and soon transforms into whatever the genre of music is called that makes you want to immediately go on a massive adventure.

I dunno about that, though between the Asus ROG Ally X and the Steam Deck OLED, those who stayed their hand on their earlier handheld gaming PC counterparts do have a couple of quality second-genners to choose from. Valve’s effort manages to wring multiple performance, design, and battery life improvements out of its new display, while the ROG Ally X makes similar upgrades with a bigger-yet-better take on the original ROG Ally.\nThe only thing to do, clearly, is make them fight. It’s probably in the Irish Code Duello or something: \"Should one portable games box impugn another’s honour by releasing shortly after it, satisfaction must be claimed through a comparison article.\" My hands are bound here, folks, though if you yourself have been playing the waiting game on a handheld purchase, perhaps this little head-to-head can help you pick the right one.\nRead more",

You awake to a world of tree trunks that twist like viscera and corroded contraptions powered by luminous goop that’s stored in the balls, uh, big glass orbs. A beam of light soon fills your character with newfound vigour, which is a nice moment of triumph in what otherwise feels like a deeply oppressive rust pit, all unsteady platforms and jagged pipes.\nIt doesn’t take long before you start spotting examples of the reason Bionic Bay went viral earlier this week. Above your head hangs a painstakingly detailed mass of vents and cables, looming lifelike with dust and shadow and history. I stood and stared because I’d seen how the sausage was made, but I like to think I would have lingered longer than usual anyway. It really is just that impressive.\nRead more",

          "description": "There have been quite a few doubts about Bloober Team's ability to remake Silent Hill 2 in a way that keeps the spirit of the original while breathing new life into the legendary horror game. I've been guilty of perpetuating some of this cynicism myself, but there's a chance the game could actually turn out to be good.\n\n\nA number of journalists have been treated to a preview of the Silent Hill 2 remake lately, and feedback suggests Bloober might actually have nailed it. With the release date just a few weeks away, early opinions seem to be positive. \n\n\n\n\nEurogamer's Thomas Morgan says they're excited about what the full game will bring, praising the developer for daring to make a few changes. Jasmine Gould-Wilson, over on GamesRadar, said they went into the preview \"cautiously,\" but was \"pleasantly surprised,\" adding that they're \"more than ready to give Silent Hill 2 Remake the chance it deserves,\" while the Metro refers to the game as \"far better than we expected.\"\n\n\nSilent no longer\n\n\nFrom just these three opinions, it seems many of us may  be able to breathe a sigh of relief. Bloober Team has often been criticized for its mishandling of delicate subjects in its games, such as mental health. Given that the original Silent Hill 2 is wholly a psychological game, concerns were raised over whether the same studio that made The Medium could do one of the most influential survival horror games any justice.\n\n\nAlongside these early indications of its potential, we've also been treated to a new story trailer. The teaser gives us a good look at some of the titular foggy town's inhabitants, including Eddie, Laura, Angela, and, of course, Maria.\n\n\nWith a modern control scheme not too far removed from the remake of Resident Evil 2, new puzzles, fresh visuals, and, above all, respect for the source material, we could be looking at one hell of a return for Silent Hill 2.\n\nThe post Silent Hill 2 Remake previews are out, and they sound promising appeared first on Destructoid.",

Let's take a look at the conditions associated with those tasks, and if you should unlock the card at all. \n\n\nEA FC 24 Gift Monday FUTTIES objective tasks\n\n\nThe Gift Monday FUTTIES objective has four separate tasks. Each task has certain conditions, and you can complete them in any order you like. Some of the tasks will finish quicker compared to the remaining ones. \n\n\n\nSpanish 6: Score 6 goals using players from Spain in Squad Battles on Min. Semi-Pro difficulty (or Rivals/Champions).\n\n\nCrossing Guard: Assist 5 goals using Crosses with players from Liga F in Squad Battles matches on Min. Semi-Pro difficulty (or Rivals/Champions).\n\n\nGift Received: Score a Header goal in 2 separate matches in Squad Battles on Min. Semi-Pro difficulty (or Rivals/Champions).\n\n\nLiga F Gift Set: Win 4 matches in Squad Battles on Min. Semi-Pro difficulty (or Rivals/Champions) while having Min. 3 players from Liga F in your starting 11.\n\n\n\nThe easiest way to get the card is by completing the tasks in Squad Battles. This is incredibly helpful if you can't field your best starting XI to complete the tasks. Moreover, you can also control the difficulty of the AI-opponents, making it easier to score goals and get the required number of wins. \n\n\nIf you used Gift Links in FIFA 23, you'll know that this card is going to be equally fun to use. Is she going to be super-meta? No. But she has the correct playstyles required to survive in the current in-game meta. In fact, she could be really helpful to use if you plan on spamming crosses from the wings. Just boost her base Shooting and Dribbling and she should be good to go in the competitive modes. \n\nThe post EA FC 24: How to get Gift Monday FUTTIES card for free appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The newest update to Meme Sea added a cool new item called The Portal. If you've ever played Minecraft, The Portal will probably remind you of the famous Nether Portal but don't worry, you won't end up in the Nether if you use it. Here is how to get The Portal in Meme Sea.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to get The Portal in Meme Sea\n\n\nTo get The Portal in Meme Sea you will need to defeat the Meme Beast boss. The Doge-resembling sea monster randomly spawns ou at sea, and you will get a notification popup when it does so. There's no way to specifically look for the Meme Beast but you will be notified once it spawns.\n\n\nThe Meme Beast has 1,000,000 HP so it's a pretty lengthy battle. But once defeated, the Meme Beast has a roughly 25% chance of dropping The Portal. This means that on average it will take 1-4 Meme Beast kills to get The Portal to drop, so don't be discouraged if it doesn't drop the first time you defeat it. However, once it does, you will never need to farm it again as it has infinite uses!\n\n\nHow to use The Portal in Meme Sea\n\n\nIn Meme Sea, The Portal is an item that allows you to instantaneously teleport to any other island you have found. By using the item, you will see a pop-up menu that allows you to choose which island to teleport to. This makes The Portal the absolute fastest travel method in all of Meme Sea, much faster than actually sailing between islands.\n\n\nEven though it's not its main purpose, you can also equip The Portal as a weapon and hit enemies using your M1 attack. There are no special skills associated with The Portal, and there is no increased damage for using it, so it's more of just a funny little bonus.\n\nThe post How to get and use The Portal in Meme Sea appeared first on Destructoid.",

The required fodder can be ground out by completing the SBCs currently available in Ultimate Team. \n\n\nTask 1 - Inaki Williams\n\n\n\nMin. 1 Players from: LALIGA EA SPORTS\n\n\nMin. 1 Players: Any TOTS or TOTW\n\n\nMin. Team Rating: 88\n\n\n\nIt's better to use a TOTS item to complete this task, as they can be found in different packs. You can either complete the 84x10 SBC or the 85x10 SBC to try your luck at getting a TOTS card. \n\n\nEA FC 24 Inaki Williams FUTTIES SBC solutions\n\n\nHere's the solutions for completing the Inaki Williams FUTTIES SBC in EA FC 24. \n\n\nTask 1 - Inaki Williams\n\n\n\nMapi Leon: 89\n\n\nIrene Paredes: 88\n\n\nVictor Osimhen: 88\n\n\nAny 88-rated TOTS/TOTW item\n\n\nMarie Katoto: 88\n\n\nJan Oblak: 88\n\n\nJoshua Kimmich: 88\n\n\nLucy Bronze: 87\n\n\nLina Magull: 87\n\n\nGianluigi Donnarumma: 87\n\n\nLea Schuller: 86\n\n\n\nWhile I don't expect this Williams card to be a top-tier item in the current meta, there's an interesting part. The presence of the Aerial playstyle+ means you could use him to cross at the back post in attempts to score some headers. You'll need to boost his Shooting (93) and Passing (90) stats to use in competitive modes. Make sure to obtain the card with your surplus fodder, as it can be a nice super-sub in certain situations. \n\nThe post EA FC 24: How to complete Inaki Williams FUTTIES SBC appeared first on Destructoid.",

Along with the glorious news that PC players finally get to experience the action-driven RPG, there’s also a brand new trailer — ‘Deliverance’\n\n\n\n\nBefore Final Fantasy 16's September 17 PC debut, or September 18 for folks in Japan, you can play the demo right now on both Steam and Epic Games Store.

          "description": "With its thrilling new chapters, the Jujutsu Kaisen manga series has been taking things up a notch. Our favorite finger-eating sorcerer, Yuji Itadori, continues to tap more into his powers, all to gear up for the highly anticipated end battle. So, to keep up with everything, take a look at our Jujutsu Kaisen manga schedule.\n\n\nJujutsu Kaisen manga release schedule \n\n\nJujutsu Kaisen Chapter 267 will be released on Aug. 25, 2024. After this, the schedule is relatively up in the air, but the manga series has been confirmed to end on Sept. 30, with its last five chapters. That means JJK will conclude with 271 chapters, wrapping up the saga of the main protagonist, Yuji Itadori, and the Jujutsu Kaisen crew. \n\n\nImage via MAPPA \n\n\nJujutsu Kaisen's manga chapters are generally released every Sunday. They launch around 8 a.m. PT/ 11 a.m. ET/ 12 a.m. JST on Manga Plus and Viz Media. We have seen some delays in its schedule, including Chapter 259 and Chapter 253. Given that there are only five chapters left, it doesn't look like there will be any more delays, but there may be a two-week gap somewhere in between. \n\n\nEven if the Jujutsu Kaisen manga is reaching its climax, we can still hold onto the anime. The show left off with the Shibuya Incident arc, which is about four arcs away from the manga.  We'll just have to see how long it will take for the anime to catch up to the manga, where it may leave us with another season and a potential movie finale. \n\nThe post Never miss a new chapter with our Jujutsu Kaisen (JJK) manga release schedule appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Creds are one of the several currencies present in Madden NFL 25, and some can even confuse it with the standard coins you earn by playing the game.\n\n\nUnlike coins, creds are marked as bright blue in color (although both have the same circular shape). This currency is also used very differently than coins, which makes it important to understand the best ways to earn and use it.\n\n\nHow to get creds in Madden NFL 25\n\n\nThe easiest way to get creds (might not be the most efficient) in Madden NFL 25 is to play the game. Every complete game will hand you a certain amount of this credit. While this process is time-consuming, it's easy, and there's no limit.\n\n\nIn the Superstar mode, you can earn creds during the Free Time phase by making a decision. Doing so nets you about 100 creds every time you choose Call Out or Prank War. You can also complete different objectives in MUT to get creds. Similarly, this credit can also be obtained by playing through the Franchise and Superstar mode (the rate definitely varies, based on your activities and how you're leveling up).\n\n\nImage via Destructoid\n\n\nBest ways to use creds in Madden NFL 25\n\n\nThe blue creds are best used to unlock different customization items, and my favorite is the celebration bundles. You can unlock different celebrations once you've accumulated enough and then use them in Superstar mode.\n\n\nThere are additional animations that you can unlock as well. But unlocking celebrations seems to be the way to go. Unfortunately, this particular credit can't be used to unlock any packs in Ultimate Team. This would have been certainly beneficial, especially for those who don't purchase Madden points. Having the ability to open packs would have been better use of creds compared to unlocking new celebrations. \n\nThe post What are creds in Madden NFL 25? appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The time has finally come for Jujutsu Kaisen fans, as the manga series marks its upcoming end in the following five chapters.\n\n\nThe creator of the beloved saga, Gege Akutami, officially confirmed JJK's conclusion during a Jump Press program. Akutami indicates they are working on the finale, with the manga set to end on Sept. 30, 2024. They also mention that the finale will \"(probably) satisfy as many people as possible\" to give the compelling narrative some justice.\n\n\nImage via MAPPA\n\n\nAlthough the series had already been confirmed to end in 2024, it's surprising to see just how fast the manga will be on its way out. A lot has certainly changed since we first saw Yuji Itadori, the goofy yet strong main protagonist. The journey of these characters has been a part of our lives for years, and now, we'll finally know the end of his story amongst everyone else in the cast. Even more so, we'll discover what happens to one of the series' main antagonists, Sukuna, the King of Curses, who has frequently taken over Itadori's body.\n\n\nThe JJK manga began as a Weekly Shonen Jump on March 5, 2018. It has since gained traction, especially when its anime adaptation launched on Oct. 3, 2020. The demonic saga continues to take shape in both video game and movie form, stirring up the pot even more.\n\n\nEven if the manga will be concluding, the anime still has quite a ways to go. Season 2 leaves off somewhere in Chapter 138, meaning it needs to catch up to Chapter 266 in the manga. Fortunately, Season 3 has already been confirmed, so that'll help fill the void when the manga ends.\n\n\nBut if you still need to prepare for Jujutsu Kaisen's manga ending, check out the latest chapters of the series on Viz Media and Manga Plus. Just be sure to cram it all in before Sept. 30 to experience it in its entirety.\n\nThe post Jujutsu Kaisen is officially coming to an end in five chapters appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "If today's RPGs don't have enough airships for you, one developer hopes to rectify that in style. Sky Oceans: Wings for Hire wants to bring folks back to the \"golden era of classic JRPGs,\" and we'll see how it fares the skies starting on October 10, 2024.\n\n\nPublisher PQube and developer Octeto Studios announced the date along with the new trailer below. You can spot some real Skies of Arcadia vibes at first glance. When this one launches, it'll be plundering the skies on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam, Epic Games Store, and GOG. \n\n\n\n\nYou might have already taken these wings for a spin yourself at this point. Sky Oceans had a demo during Steam Next Fest in June, offering up a brief taste of the life of a dogfighting sky pirate. The aerial battles themselves are turn-based, giving you the option to attack or evade enemy fire when necessary. If your crew's gear isn't cutting it, you can take some time outside of battle to reinforce equipment, boost your arsenal of weapons, and improve overall agility.\n\n\nThe story has you traversing the world above the clouds as Glenn Windwalker, who certainly has a name suited for adventure. The actions you and your squad take throughout the narrative can shape the future of communities around the world, each providing their own unique characters, dilemmas, and related sub-quests.\n\n\nWhether or not Sky Oceans lives up to its inspirations is still, if you'll pardon the expression, up in the air. Personally, we don't have nearly enough sky-faring RPGs featuring rag-tag pirate crews, so the more the merrier. \n\nThe post Sky Oceans: Wings for Hire aims to scratch that Skies of Arcadia itch this October appeared first on Destructoid.",

I mean the original version of Resident Evil 2, not the 2019 remake. Of course. Just clarifying.\n\n\nWhile Resident Evil 2 is often best remembered as a PS1 title, it was also released on other platforms, including Windows. Unfortunately, PC games from the era can be extremely finicky on modern platforms. There’s plenty of voodoo you can do to pull it off, but for those who don’t want to bother, GOG’s re-release will be pretty tempting. Rather than simply re-introduce the original Windows version back into the wilds, they’re going the extra mile to make sure it’s more comfortable on our futuristic super-computers.\n\n\n\n\nThe list of improvements shows items that are both necessary and hilarious. They include things like “Issue-less game exit” and “Improved game registry settings” among the audio fixes and improved subtitles. Then there are fewer must-haves like The 4th Survivor and The Tofu Survivor being available from the beginning.\n\n\nThe re-releases of the original versions of the first three Resident Evil games were announced this past June, along with the sudden appearance of the first title. 2 and 3 were left pending without a given release date, though you could buy the full trilogy in preparation. We’re still waiting to hear when we’ll see Resident Evil 3.\n\n\nFor my money, Resident Evil 2 is easily the best game in the series. While I have a strong fondness for the 2001 Resident Evil remake, I find that the infested police station is a much better setting than the Spencer Estate. The Resident Evil 2 remake is fantastic in its own right, but something gets lost when you remove the tank controls and fixed camera angles.\n\n\nThe PC re-release of Resident Evil 2 will be available on GOG on August 27, 2024.\n\nThe post The GOG PC re-release of OG Resident Evil 2 is out later this month appeared first on Destructoid.",

These rewards also include the Sentinel Multitool and Jetpack which can be unlocked after a series of objectives, including solving a glyph puzzle\n\n\nHow to find a Harmonic Camp in No Man’s Sky\n\n\nTo get started, players would first have to find a Harmonic Camp. These can be found by defeating Corrupted Sentinels, who are most likely present on a Corrupted Planet. Look for a Dissonant star system, as they are your best bet for finding a Corrupted Planet in No Man’s Sky. Once you find a Corrupted Planet and defeat some Corrupted Sentinels, you should be able to find an Echo Locator. You may also find an Echo Locator by destroying Dissonance Resonators which are present near Corrupted Sentinels.\n\n\nHarmonic Interface puzzle in No Man’s Sky\n\n\nSelect Echo Locator in your inventory and interact with it so that the Echo Locator “resonates”. Doing so will reveal the location of a Harmonic camp. Head to its location and interact with a computer there which is called the Harmonic Interface.\n\n\nHow to solve Harmonic Interface puzzle\n\n\n\nTo start the glyph puzzle, select “Scan memory registers”.\n\n\nThere will be three math puzzles for players to solve which are pretty easy. Just make sure you remember the answers you’ve given. They will come in handy for the next part of the puzzle.\n\n\nSelect “Access main interface” and choose “Input override glyphs”.\n\n\nNow, you have to select glyphs with numbers that are the same as the results of the previous math questions.\n\n\n\nThat’s all there is to it. This will unlock the Sentinel Multitool and Jetpack, and players can find both items in the tent next to the Harmonic Interface.\n\nThe post How to complete Harmonic Interface puzzle in No Man’s Sky appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Bloodborne's PC version is the most desired game in the world — right above Bloodborne simply running at 60 FPS on PlayStation. Not a week goes by on the Internet without us hearing about new rumors that Bloodborne is totally coming to finally grace PC gamers with its gory awesomeness. Sadly, it's not a reality yet, but rogue gaming science is getting us closer.\n\n\nNot too long ago, hacker DwE revealed he'd been able to get Bloodborne to run on PC via the shadPS4 emulator, but he only had audio output. That might seem bad, but it was a sign that something could get out of it. Over a month later, we learned that DwE is finally getting to play Bloodborne, though the visuals are a bit different than what you'd expect:\n\n\n\n\nThe tweet above is in Portuguese, but the gist of it is easy to understand. DwE is using Linux and altered the game’s look to prevent the emulator from crashing. That’s why it looks less like the PC version of Bloodborne and more like it came out of Nintendo's Virtual Boy. \n\n\nI really like the black and red color palette. It really drives home the notion that this version is likely cursed and that you probably shouldn't play it, but I'm aware that it might not make for the most eye-pleasing experience if you plan to play the game for longer than 10 minutes at a time. \n\n\nAn even newer video shows the game running without the color correction, but the sound and even a lot of the video are way too messed up for it to be enjoyable.\n\n\n\n\nBut if thought that a haunted version of Bloodborne on PC would be the only news we'd get about this project for a while, then I have good news. ShadPS4's Twitter account has just revealed a screenshot of the retail version of the game running on PC with the correct colors.\n\n\n\n\nWhat does that mean?  I don't know, but I sure am eagerly waiting for whatever comes next.\n\n\n\nThe post Hackers just got a Virtual Boy-looking version of Bloodborne running on PC appeared first on Destructoid.",
