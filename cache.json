Since its launch in 2012, the trivia-focused website and YouTube channel has amassed a huge following, showcasing little-known facts and uncovering lost games that never saw the light of day. Now, the team is turning its attention towards another type of project altogether: a tabletop card game.\nDo You Know Gaming?, a collaboration between the DYKG team and Lost in Cult, is a dungeon-crawling trivia game with a 1980s 'big box' feel. On a basic level, the card game lets you choose a character — each of whom has their own special abilities such as health bonuses, increased inventory space etc. — and set out on a quest to collect four Relics. Along the way, you'll encounter monsters who can be damaged by answering gaming trivia questions of varying difficulty, collect loot and take on final bosses. If it sounds like a video game in card form, that's because it is.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Hand me the bug repellent bat-spray, Robin.\nWhen it comes to superhero games, Rocksteady Studios served us up a trio of the very best examples of the genre with its superlative Batman: Arkham Trilogy. Whether you prefer the smaller scale and comparative intimacy of Batman: Arkham Asylum, the vast open world of Arkham City or the Batmobile-powered battles of Arkham Knight, there's a lot of top-notch bat-action for bat-fans to dig into throughout this delightfully dark odyssey.\nWe've had our fingers crossed for a long time that at least some of the incredible Arkham games would eventually (bat)wing their way onto the Switch and now we've got the entire flipping trilogy to blast our way through. But how do they perform on Nintendo's ageing portable machine? As expected, 2009's Arkham Asylum, which debuted on PS3, plays fairly well. With scaled-back graphics and a 30fps target in the mix, it's a solid port that gets the job done, even if it does with zero panache and a few more stutters and texture pop-in issues than we'd have liked.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The developer was behind several of the stellar titles found on the system, many of which were some of the most original games in history. One of the most unique titles released by the UK-based developer was the 3D action-shooter Jet Force Gemini, which launched in 1999. While Rare had much success in the first-person shooter genre with titles such as GoldenEye 007 and Perfect Dark, it decided to take a different approach for this title and set about making it a third-person experience.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

That became apparent when Romero’s new autobiography, ‘Doom Guy: Life In First Person’, showed up on shelves with a glowing back cover quote from Carmack. The latter praised Romero’s “remarkable memory”, and waxed wistfully about their shared impact on the gaming medium. “For years, I thought that I had been born too late and missed out on participating in the heroic eras of computing,” Carmack wrote. “Only much later did I realise that Romero and I were at the nexus of a new era - the 3D game hackers.”\nRead more",

A kick in the dino groin to this year's monster hunting pretender Wild Hearts, perhaps? Who can say. Formally unveiled at tonight's Game Awards, this new Monster Hunter is coming in 2025, and looks to be the jazzed-up successor to Monster Hunter: World. That's not a diss on Rise (which was excellent). Just that it's being developed for PC and consoles first, rather than Switch. And it looks rad as heck.

Running on Unreal Engine 5 and set in fictional, near-future Colton County, USA, it's a PvPvE affair in which you roam a big ruined map either alone or as a team, fighting other players, NPCs and renegade \"natural\" elements. Published by Level Infinite, it'll be a premium game with live service elements and microtransactions, and there's no release date yet.

Revealed as part of yesterday's Day of the Devs showcase, the game continues the adventures of spacey watchmaker No Man, who must solve mysteries that span two parallel realities, Black Rapture and Constant Testament. In Black Rapture, the Big Bang never happened. I feel 'universe in which the universe never began' is an... unpromising choice for a setting, but I am not an astrophysician, nor very much of a magic-realist, and I know eff-all about jazz.

          "description": "“Moebius built a world that doesn’t exist, but you can understand it. It’s a realist world. A world you can relate you, but it’s not your world,” says Edouard Caplain, art director for Jusant, the meditative tower climbing adventure that is Life Is Strange studio Don’t Nod’s latest game. Moebius was the pseudonym of French artist Jean Giraud, and whose surreal sci-fi and fantasy landscapes, with washes of contrasting colour and impossibly huge structures of soaring rock, have influenced games for years. You can certainly see that influence in Jusant, too: a world you can understand, though it's quite unlike your own. \nRPS slapped on the coveted Bestest Best sticker when reviewing it a few weeks back, calling it “a show don’t tell masterpiece”. A sentiment I can get behind as a long-standing proponent of silent games ever since the Evil Within 2 insisted on puncturing its creepy baroque ambience with consistently stupid dialogue. Jusant comes from a team that know how to write a conversation, though. So why the change of pace this time around?\r\n\n \nRead more",

Despite announcing they were shutting up shop following the release of this year's fantastic Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew, today marks the grand finale for their stealth strategy masterpiece in the form of a new free Treasure Hunt update, and the release of their two paid expansions. Each brings a brand-new pirate to The Red Marley's undead crew, as well as their own half-dozen story missions to play through spread across islands old and new, and once you've begun each of their respective questlines, they're readily available to play in any of the game's regular plunderings, too. \nMimimi have kept the identity of these pirates a secret until now, but after playing both DLCs for a big chunk of the last week, I'm confident in saying this is exactly the swansong Shadow Gambit deserves - with one of the expansions in particular bringing a poignant touch of coming full circle on Mimimi's work as a studio.

Then, between talk of it being set inside a cosmic uterus known as The Sarcophagus and having to use seeds and plants over successive runs to alter the shape of the map to your whim, it only became more intriguing. Now, after playing almost two hours of this Metroid-y roguelite for myself, there's still a lot about it to take in and digest, but holy moly what a thing to behold at the same time.

It turns out that trying to complete an estimated 100-hour RPG during the run-up to The Game Awards is too much for this humble Scriptor. There are still many more tabletop-style planetary maps to discover and plunder, many more character levels to scale, and many more cursed artefacts to tamper with before my protagonist, the closet Chaos worshipper Bruschetta de Plonque, can pronounce herself mistress of the Kronos Expanse - assuming the Inquisition doesn’t claim her first. But after 20 hours of the game, I can absolutely say that I’m looking forward to the next 80. While it doesn’t have the cinematic swagger and raw anecdote-generating capacity of obvious rival Baldur's Gate 3, Rogue Trader has mystique and depth to spare, both in terms of its grotty narrative and its exceedingly busy combat and levelling systems.\r\n \nRead more",

Sure, there's some spectacle in narrow escapes from the nasty humans - and their factories that make the plants droopy - but throughout the rebellion I ditched my bow for a shotgun with extended mags and a muzzle brake. For a game that's all, \"the humans are bad\", I was ready to defect. At least I would've been able to keep my shotgun.\nRead more",

I'm just here for the nice-looking flamingos, Rockstar, not a 24/7 twerk stream I can access from the palm of my hand. Of course, TV watching may yet have been preserved beyond what we've seen so far in the first trailer for GTA 6, but even if it's been consigned to the bin of modern history, there might yet be one light in the TikTok-esque darkness to make GTA 6's in-game social media network worthwhile. \nUpon closer inspection of the account names seen in the trailer, it's \"PlanetLeonidaMan\" that gives me hope, because if this isn't a riff on the Florida Man meme, I'll take a dump on a dead possum during rush hour traffic, hurl Oreos at Matthew as we argue over our empty coffee maker (teapot, come on), and try to cross the Atlantic in a hamster wheel vessel to demand some answers. \nRead more",

We may not all be not be naturally disposed to it, but there's much to be said for the fleeting, if unbridled happiness that comes from running barefoot into the teeth of the wind or getting caught in a rainstorm without a coat.\nNine times out of ten, you might get wet and have cold fingers, but that one time that you get wet, have cold fingers and feel red-raw and alive is a doozy. A Highland Song, a lone and dangerous jaunt through the Scottish highlands, is trying to capture that feeling, most especially in segments where you sprint across rocks and heather alongside a deer. At these times you leap in time to swelling music, and whoop and yell in spontaneous joy. It's lovely. It's also easy to stumble.\nRead more",

That means it has been a little over thirty years since Nintendo turned down Id's offer to port their games to the PC and began a chain reaction that would result in Carmack, Romero, and co. creating the FPS genre. Thanks, Nintendo! \n\n\nI should also thank John Romero since the co-creator and level designer of the original DOOM has just released SIGIL II, an all-new unofficial DOOM campaign completely free of charge. I still haven't had the time to experience the sequel, but, if it is anything like the original SIGIL, chances are that any DOOM fan will enjoy it quite a bit. It's a treat to all fans of the original game, but it also adds a lot of new flavor that even newer players are bound to enjoy.\n\n\nImage by John Romero\n\n\nSIGIL II, unofficial DOOM 2 episode, is available now\n\n\nSIGIL II acts as a new episode in a series, meaning that it features actual story beats. It also features nine new levels, eight new multiplayer arenas, a new OST composed by James Paddock, and new art.\n\n\nOn top of this new release, Romero will also be hosting a live Twitch event today, where he will be joining DOOM's other John co-creator, John Carmack, to discuss the original game. \n\n\n\n\nIt's great to see that DOOM has survived for so long, and not just because of the latest games in the series. The older games are very much alive as well. Just this year, we also saw the release of one of the greatest mods of all time. I'm of course talking about Myhouse.WAD for DOOM II, which I'm just gonna recommend you try getting into fully blind.\n\n\nIf you own the original DOOM, you can now download SIGIL and SIGIL II for free, or buy their incredibly rad old-school big box versions here.\n\nThe post DOOM co-creator John Romero releases new Sigil II campaign for 30th anniversary appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's the second stumble for the otherwise popular Walking Dead franchise this year. The Walking Dead: Destinies, which was released earlier in December, was the subject of minor controversy surrounding its graphics.\n\n\n\n\nWhat was The Walking Dead: Betrayal?\n\n\nAnnounced at San Diego Comic-Con 2023, The Walking Dead Betrayal was a social deduction game that blended elements of The Walking Dead and Among Us. \n\n\nPlayers would work together in teams of Survivors to escape hordes of walkers. However, the social element came into play via \"Traitors,\" Survivors whose goal is to sabotage the team for their own success. \n\n\nAs of the announcement of its closure, the game sits at a \"mixed\" rating on Steam, across a meager 111 reviews. Many reviews regard the game as fine, though several lament the waning player base. Others draw attention to the similarities to Other Ocean's previous game, Project Winter, which had a similar gameplay loop.\n\n\nHow to get a refund for The Walking Dead: Betrayal\n\n\nFor players who purchased the game through Steam, getting a refund for The Walking Dead: Betrayal is as simple as requesting one through Steam. \n\n\nUsers who purchased the game through a retailer will need to contact that retailer. More information is available on the game's store page.\n\nThe post Walking Dead: Betrayal is being pulled from Steam, players to be offered a refund appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "GRYPHLINE has revealed that the next chapter in the Arknights series will soon make its console debut. A PlayStation 5 version of Arknights: Endfield has been announced, alongside an upcoming technical test for the PC version of the game.\n\n\nArknights: Endfield is an RPG that aims to deliver a blend Arknight's signature strategy with real-time combat. In a new trailer shown during The Game Awards, we can see the combat system in action alongside our first glance at the game's boss battles. As of writing, GRYPHLINE has not announced a date for the PS5, PC, or mobile versions of the game. However, players can sign up now for the PC technical test that will begin on January 11.\n\n\n\n\nThe PC technical test will have an English user interface and both Mandarin and Japanese voiceover options. The test puts you in the role of the Endministrator of Endfield Industries, who is rumored to show up whenever a crisis hits the company or the wider world of Talos-II. You'll get a chance to explore that world while leading a crew of nine playable characters, exploring the Endfield Industries tech tree, and dipping your toes in the battle system. \n\n\nThe factory system — which lets you place factory buildings strategically and gain an edge in battle with items manufactured through your automated production line — will also be in play during the test period. Through this system you'll be able to directly impact Talos-II by modifying the terrain and surrounding environments. \n\n\nSign-ups will be live until December 23 at 7:59 p.m. PT. \n\nThe post Arknights: Endfield reveals PS5 plans, PC technical test sign-ups appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "After winning big last night at The Game Awards and bagging trophies in three major categories, Remedy Entertainment has just announced \"The Final Draft\" for Alan Wake 2; a major update that not only introduces the New Game Plus mode we've been waiting on, but also unlocks an additional ending to the main story.\n\n\nWith all the intricate plot threads and surrealist narrative developments in Alan Wake 2, a few more playthroughs are definitely in order to wrap your head around Sam Lake's acclaimed sequel. And why start from scratch when you can retain all your equipment and instead contend with more challenging mobs?\n\n\nThe studio is teasing numerous \"subtle additions\" in the New Game Plus experience, including a Nightmare Difficulty setting and even new manuscript pages and videos. There are also bug fixes and performance optimizations, which might help the demanding game run more smoothly on older PC hardware.  The Final Draft is scheduled to go live on December 11.\n\n\nvia Remedy Entertainment\n\n\nHow to unlock the New Game Plus mode in Alan Wake 2\n\n\nIt goes without saying that a completed playthrough of the game is required to unlock the New Game Plus, but it looks like the new additions in The Final Draft will also require you to finish the game at least once.\n\n\nYou retain all your Charms and character upgrades, but the weapons will be found in the character's first available shoebox, as opposed to their inventory.\n\n\nIt's unclear if the new ending can be unlocked during your first playthrough, though with two more expansion packs (Night Springs and The Lake House) coming our way in 2024 and beyond, this probably won't serve as the definitive conclusion to the stories of our main protagonists.\n\nThe post Alan Wake 2 is getting a “New Game Plus experience” next week appeared first on Destructoid.",

Not for the sake of simply disturbing an audience, but instead, they’re stories communicating the more unsettling aspects of humanity — the parts we shy away from or refuse to acknowledge.\n\n\nGrief, depression, trauma, and pain are all prevailing themes in these narratives, and while they don't aim to shock, they inevitably do.

The PC-exclusive title had its release date revealed alongside a brief gameplay trailer at The Game Awards.

          "description": "It's been a long night of The Game Awards. Many trailers have been shown for upcoming games, but only one can be the final trailer. Capcom has taken that honor this year by revealing the newest installment in the Monster Hunter series, Monster Hunter Wilds.\n\n\nAs has been a recurring theme during this event, we didn't exactly see a ton of raw gameplay in this trailer. We do, however, see a lot of monsters. Also, some sick mount acrobatics are shown off. And before we know it, a title card is thrown on screen. Clearly this is a teaser just to let us all know this game exists, since that projected date of 2025 is still a ways off from now. Feel free to speculate based on the footage we were shown.\n\n\n\n\nAfter the trailer, Geoff Keighley brought Monster Hunter series producer Ryozo Tsujimoto to the stage. Despite acknowledging that the game is dated for 2025, Keighley asked Tsujimoto when we might expect to play Monster Hunter Wilds. As one might expect, the answer for when we'll play this video game coming out in 2025 is \"2025.\" However, Tsujimoto clarified that we should expect to learn more about the title during the Summer of 2024.\n\n\nMonster Hunter Wilds will release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Steam. This is notable, as the game's predecessor, Monster Hunter Rise, was originally a Nintendo Switch title. The platforms shown indicate that Wilds will be closer in spirit to Monster Hunter World, which will be roughly seven years old by the time Wilds comes out. \n\n\nI'm interested to see if games like Monster Hunter Rise on the Switch and Monster Hunter Now on mobile devices drives winds up attracting new audiences to Monster Hunter Wilds once it releases. It's certainly made me pay more attention to the series, so we'll have to see if this strategy pays off when Monster Hunter Wilds debuts two years from now.\n\nThe post Capcom announces Monster Hunter Wilds, coming 2025 appeared first on Destructoid.",

As one of the biggest surprises of The Game Awards, Embark surprise launched the game on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S. \n\n\nThough we've gotten a sample of it prior, we'll finally be able to see everything the adrenaline-filled shooter has to offer. With the launch of Season 1, you'll get to play in the Las Vegas virtual arena that'll leave you dazzled with its lights and even some unexpected features such as UFOs. \n\n\nAs Embark has explained, at its core, The Finals is a game show featuring arenas inspired by real-world locations. You're given the freedom to create your own hero and vie for victory. It doesn't hold back when it comes to mayhem-filled fun, and you can show off your skills in environments reactive enough for furniture to be destroyed and buildings to collapse. \n\n\nImage via Embark. \n\n\nThe hype behind The Finals\n\n\nThe game's unique premise and gorgeous visuals attracted over 7.5 million players during its Open Beta. Though it was praised by critics and players alike, some technical issues slightly dampened the experience. Embark has acknowledged these hiccups and has paid attention to community requests when tweaking the final release. \n\n\n\n\nIf you're new to The Finals, be prepared for something quite novel. As creative director Gustav Tilleby explains, \"The Finals isn’t another battle royale, military sim, or tactical FPS – there are plenty of those out there. It’s an entirely new take on shooters.\" It's hard to argue against this, as while we've had FPS games with destructible environments before (looking at you BattleBit Remastered), the studio's doing it on a scale that few others would attempt. \n\n\nEmbark is a relatively young studio, having been founded in 2019. If pulled off correctly, The Finals could be the title that puts the Swedish team on the map. \n\nThe post The Finals receives a surprise launch at The Game Awards appeared first on Destructoid.",

There's also a co-op mode where players can form teams of three or six to take on specialized combat missions.\n\n\n\n\nI'll eat up anything with mech action, and Mecha BREAK looks like high-quality mech action. An Open Beta opens for pre-registration tomorrow on PC via Steam, GOG, and Epic Games Store.\n\n\nMecha BREAK will be released in 2024 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.\n\nThe post Mecha BREAK is a multiplayer mech combat game with co-op and battle royale appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "For the tenth anniversary since the announcement of No Man’s Sky, Hello Games has revealed their next game, Light No Fire. As is tradition at The Game Awards, it also came with a trailer.\n\n\nLight No Fire is aiming to be a survival sandbox game set in a massive, procedurally generated open world claimed to be comparative in size to Earth. That’s the planet we live on!\n\n\n\n\nThe trailer shows off multiplayer, construction, and all kinds of traversal types on birds and dragons. The order of the day seems to be scale, but there are some cool scenes, like rabbit people bowing for some reason.\n\n\nScale is nice, but I’d like to see more about how it will differentiate itself from other survival sandbox games. Particularly No Man’s Sky. It’s a pretty full genre right now, and “big map” isn’t really the selling point it used to be. However, Hello Games has learned a lot from the constant development of No Man’s Sky.\n\n\nLight No Fire has no announced release window, and the only announced platform right now is PC.\n\nThe post Hello Games unveils massive open-world multiplayer game, Light No Fire appeared first on Destructoid.",

Developer 10 Chambers may have your back, as their latest project Den of Wolves was unveiled during The Game Awards 2023.\n\n\nI'm gonna be upfront, I don't know what to say about this trailer. It doesn't really show heist gameplay, so... I'm just going to take 10 Chambers' word that that's the genre of the game. They certainly talk about heists, that's for sure. Something interesting does seem to be going on, and it does apparently involve blowing up a safe. The creator of Payday: The Heist, Payday 2, and GTFO is behind this, so, yeah, that checks out. If you'd like to make more sense of this footage than me, than by all means.\n\n\n\n\nThis reveal came on the heels of the Final Chapter update for GTFO. Those who are interested in that title can try it out for free on December 10.\n\n\nMeanwhile, no release date for Den of Wolves has been shown at this time. However, if you're interested in learning more about this sci-fi co-op heist shooter, you can follow the game on Steam.\n\nThe post Den of Wolves is a new heist game from the creator of Payday and GTFO appeared first on Destructoid.",

And Tales of Kenzera: ZAU certainly seems like it's taking a fresh look at its genre inspirations, bringing something new to action-platforming next April.\n\n\nTales of Kenzera: ZAU is from Surgent Studios, under the EA Originals label, working in collaboration with Critical Role. It's a huge list of big names, but the idea itself is really compelling. ZAU is a gorgeous action-platformer with some 'Vania inspiration.\n\n\n\n\nPer a GameSpot interview with the studio, ZAU is story inside a story, as a son lost in grief for his dead father reads a tale about Zau. Zau makes a bargain with the god of death to bring his father back from the dead.\n\n\nSeems ready to bring on the emotions, but the action and platform-hopping look good too. We'll see how the next EA Original performs next year, too.

Fortunately, the team at Don't Nod has me covered, because they're teeing up a whole new universe in the upcoming Lost Record: Bloom & Rage.\n\n\nAt first glance, it certainly looks like a new Life is Strange game. It shows some teenagers rocking out, running through the woods, and something involving a burning building. You know, typical teenage stuff. However, there's some sort of void, and afterwards, a cut to the future. What, exactly, happened here, and why does our one character at the end look pretty shaken by it? That's for us to presumably find out.\n\n\n\n\nThat mystery will hopefully be solved when Lost Record: Bloom & Rage comes out in late 2024. We don't have a lot to work with here, but it has sparked my curiosity at any rate. We'll update this post as we learn more about this adventure.\n\nThe post Life is Strange developers unveil a new world in Lost Record: Bloom & Rage appeared first on Destructoid.",

It looks like an adventure and a half with beasts of immense size roaming on the ground, in the sky, and underwater. You of course won't be going into it unarmed, as the trailer gives up glimpses of some of the action-packed sword combat. \n\n\nThe game is inspired by the 1592 Chinese fantasy novel Journey to the West. Though the game seems worth getting excited about, it is not void of controversy, most of it relating to accusations of sexism at Game Science. \n\n\n IGN reports, \"several posts have surfaced from Chinese social media site Weibo, written by individuals from the studio, that contain multiple references to genitalia and sexual innuendos.\" Furthermore, there have been \"recruitment posters by the studio, produced in 2015, which featured images and headlines that point to a culture of ingrained sexism in Game Science.\"\n\n\nThis has resulted in backlash from the gaming community, but seemingly not enough to stop the game from appearing at The Game Awards.

          "description": "The Game Awards are packed with eager looks at highly anticipated games, but the ceremony is full of plenty of surprises too. One of them is a flashy Metroidvania called Tales of Kenzera: Zau, the debut game from Surgent Studios.\nZau is a boy on a quest to bring his father back from the dead. Guided by Kalunga, the God of Death, he uses his ability as a warrior shaman to defeat the ancestral spirits that roam the land of Kenzera. His main tools are a pair of magical masks; with the Moon mask he can manipulate time and crystalize enemies, and the Sun mask allows him to launch fiery spears. Studio founder Abubakar Salim says that the two masks are reminiscent of the Devil May Cry series with the way they allow the player to flip between ranged and melee modes.\n\nThe world is inspired by Bantu lore and imagery, with bright colors and mythical beasts. Additionally, the game will be scored by Nainita Desai, a British composer who made the music for Half Mermaid's Telling Lies and Immortality.\nSalim founded Surgent in 2019, but most gamers would currently recognize him as the voice of Bayek from Assassin's Creed Origins. According to him, the passing of his father motivated him to create a new project – he wanted to tell a story of grief in the form of a video game. With assistance from the Ridley Scott Creative Group and Critical Role, five years later, Tales of Kenzera: Zau tells that story.\nThe trailer ended with the news that Tales of Kenzera: Zau will be coming to PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on April 23, 2024.",

These calamities were somehow caused by the failure of a mysterious program called Project Rebirth, and now players find themselves fighting for survival in an environmentally unstable southwestern U.S. You play as a Reborn, a survivor outfitted in enhanced suits called Exo-Rigs with special weapons and augment your abilities to survive the myriad of threats, both human and elemental. Check out the cinematic trailer below. \n\n\nExoborne drops players into a shared open world where, either alone or in a party of allies, they will scavenge for resources and extract them while fending off other players. The Exo-Rig bestows special abilities, such as the ability to leap very high, and comes outfitted with a grappling hook and even a parachute, which players can use to engage in aerial combat or even ride maelstroms (think Just Cause). \nThe gameplay combines PvE and PvP and features an evolving narrative and sidequests that unfold throughout the otherwise multiplayer framework. Between primary tasks, you’ll also engage in dynamic public events and group missions. Powerful forces of nature add a chaotic wrinkle to fights; expect to engage in shootouts while getting swept up by tornados.\nCharacters, weapons, and Exo-Rigs can be customized with various mods and upgrades using the resources you extract. As a premium live-service game, Sharkmob plans to support Exoborne with various content updates, such as new live events.\nExborne is being developed in Unreal Engine 5 and is coming to PC and consoles at an undetermined date.",

The First Berserker: Khazan stands in stark contrast to the most recent entry in this universe, DNF Duel, a multiplayer fighting game released last year. \nNeople says the DNF series combines the fast-paced, higher-energy action of old-school brawlers with classic RPG elements, all wrapped in an anime-esque art style. However, with The First Berserker: Khazan, players can expect hack 'n' slash combat and plenty of customization. \nCheck it out for yourself in The First Berserker: Khazan reveal trailer below: \n\n\n\"The Pell Los Empire has been saved – at a cost,\" a press release reads. \"After the Great General Khazan and Archmage Ozma defeat the Berserk Dragon Hismar and the Dragon Legion, players will step into the shoes of Khazan as he is falsely accused of treason and exiled beyond the empire.\"\nNeople says in The First Berserker: Khazan, combat takes center stage in Khazan's quest for vengeance against those who orchestrated his downfall, \"marked by intense, aggressive, and ever-changing styles of battle.\" \nTo survive, players must master combat, upgrade character skills, and combine weapons and armor (each with unique perks). The more missions cleared, the tougher the bosses, but defeating them and finishing missions earns players powerful gear and abilities. \nThe First Berserker: Khazan will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC sometime in the future. \nWhat do you think of The First Berserker: Khazan's reveal trailer?

But after years of secret development and repeated delays, it's finally around the corner, and The Game Awards just gave us our latest look. See for yourself in the trailer below:\n\n\nThe notion of killing the Justice League, some of the most powerful people in the DC universe, has always felt like an impossible task for the Suicide Squad, and the more we see of these corrupted superheroes, the harder it looks. This trailer gives us a look at Green Lantern's arsenal of hard light weaponry, the Flash's speed and lightning bolts, Wonder Woman's lasso of truth, and a shadowy Batman (which is potentially related to Scarecrow's fear gas, though that's just speculation).\nLuckily, the Squad is equipped with a wide array of weapons and traversal techniques, making them way more mobile than they would normally be in the comics or movies. We get a good look at new gameplay of them swinging, soaring, and shooting as well, which you can experience solo with AI companions or online with friends.\nBut the best part of the new trailer? The release date hasn't changed. We can take on the Justice League next year on February 2.",

In the trailer, we get confirmation that it's still expected to hit Xbox Series X/S in 2024 alongside a new look at its extremely visceral combat. \nLike previous Hellblade II trailers, we see Senua trudging through some dangerous wilderness. She's not fighting giant monsters this time, though, as instead, she's up against more human-sized enemies. And this trailer gives us the most in-depth look at Hellblade II's combat yet – unsurprisingly, it looks great (and gruesomely realistic). \nCheck it out for yourself in the Senua's Saga: Hellblade II gameplay trailer below: \n\n\n\"The sequel to the award winning Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice sees Senua return in a brutal journey of survival through the myth and torment of Viking Iceland,\" the trailer's description reads. \"Intent on saving those who have fallen victim to the horrors of tyranny, Senua faces a battle of overcoming darkness within and without.\"\nHellblade II hits Xbox Series X/S sometime next year. \nFor more, watch this Hellblade II gameplay footage from earlier this year, and then check out this behind-the-scenes look at the game's facial animation technology. \nAre you excited for Senua's Saga: Hellblade II?

It's called Usual June, and it tells the story of a girl struggling to balance her summer break with saving the universe. You can watch the reveal trailer below.\n\n\nEven after watching the trailer, you might not have much of an idea of what the game is about; it's pretty scarce when it comes to concrete information. We see the protagonist (fittingly named June) as she hacks and slashes her way through spectral creatures in a mysterious world. Luckily, the Steam listing for the game provides some context to her actions. Here's a bit of what the developer has to say about the game:\n It sounds like it'll be telling a typical coming-of-age story mashed up with supernatural heroics. In between story beats, players will also be able to experience some \"frantic, flexible combat.\" We'll be able to get a taste of that ourselves when the game drops some time in 2025.",

          "description": "For many years, the GOG.com affiliate program has been a great way to support the project. By using our affiliate links to buy your favorite games, you granted us a small commission from GOG.com – without having to spend more than the original price.\nEarlier this year, GOG.com announced the discontinuation of its old affiliate program. Instead of using a simple referral link, they are now using two external affiliation networks that contain cross-site tracking, as considered by many ad blockers. Since we have been affiliated with GOG.com since 2009, we were able to use the legacy referral links for a couple of months after they initially discontinued them.\nUnfortunately, our affiliate links were put to rest effective November 22nd, 2023.\nSince we don't feel comfortable that you would have to use external affiliation networks just to support the project, and because tracking users is against our project policies, we decided not to join the new program.\nWe still value GOG.com as an excellent source for legally purchasing games supported by ScummVM. Even though we are not affiliated with them anymore, we'll continue to support their releases, e.g. by adding and updating the game data files' signatures for the ScummVM supported games that are available for purchase from GOG.com in our detection database and providing links to their releases in our list of available games.\nThank you GOG.com and everybody who used our affiliate link for your support over the last 14 years!\n>",
