Lucky for us Nintendo fans, Madrid-based developer Crema confirmed that the monster-battling MMO will also land on the Switch on 6th September with its 1.0 launch across all platforms.\n“There were a lot of sacrifices and there were a lot of difficulties in bringing Temtem to Switch,” said Game Director Guillermo Andrades via email. The humble, ageing little Switch celebrated its fifth birthday back in March and hardcore Nintendo fans await some word — any word -- of a more powerful successor, we thought it prudent to ask how the game is stacking up on Switch compared to the more powerful hardware it was developed for.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

We also got a release date for TMNT: Shredder's Revenge, and it's a lot closer than you might expect!

One of the coolest announcements at the event was Hill Agency: PURITYdecay, described as an \"Indigenous cybernoir detective game\" and in the works at Achimostawinan Games. Although maybe \"in the works\" isn't quite an accurate description, because the game is in fact out very soon: on August 31st this year, to be exact.\nThe trailer is a pitch-perfect hearkening back to the golden age hardboiled detective stories of the 1940s — complete with a black-and-white palette with just the occasional hint of colour to highlight the high-tech parts. High-tech because, despite its 20th century influences, this game is set quite far in the future, in 2262. It's not exactly a nice vision of the world in 240 years' time, though, as the narrator is quick to point out that it's riddled with \"crime, conflict, and propaganda\". Truly holding up a mirror to our times, then.\nRead more",

          "description": "One of the most intriguing new announcements at today's Future Of Play event had to be Psychroma, a cyberpunk horror adventure game in the works by indie developer/publisher Rocket Adrift Games. The devs describe their game as a narrative-driven side-scroller where you play as a digital medium. Imagine something halfway between Observer and Detention, then, and you'll be on the right lines.\nThe trailer harks back to the point-and-click mysteries beloved of my misspent youth, which really fits in with Psychroma's whole retro futuristic vibe. It's got that clever pixel art style that looks exactly how you remember golden age adventure games looking in the '90s, which of course means that it's much, much more polished and modern than those games ever were.\nRead more",

So I've spent most of this week chasing answers, and I've come up with a ballpark estimate of what it would cost to max out your character. The answer is: £46,000, or $51,000, to fully equip your character with the best gear as quickly as possible using premium currencies.\nRead more",

This misses the universal truth that even - and indeed, especially - when it is guaranteed nothing will go wrong, something will always go wrong in space.\nHonestly, who can say that they've played a video game set on a space station and not encountered at least one deserted corridor plunged into darkness, but with one spotlight tipped over onto its side to cast ominous shadows? Raise your hands. Terror in space has never gone out of fashion, really, but the source of the terror does seem to go in cycles.

Then, earlier this year, they announced The Cub, a side-scrolling platformer telling a parallel story of one of the poor souls left behind on our home planet while the rest of humanity buggered off to Mars. Now, Demagog seem to be expanding their Wasteland-verse with a third entry: Highwater. It's not clear how this one relates to the others just yet, but it does feature a rather lovely yellow lifeboat in a flooded cityscape. Check out the reveal trailer below.\nRead more",

Just ask the many thousands of players who missed a shot with a 90% success chance in one of their XCOM reboots. Marvel’s Midnight Suns, however, could be the Civilization studio’s biggest gamble yet. Not only is it their first game to mix substantial RPG elements into its tactical combat, but there’s nary a hit percentage in sight. In the four hours I spent playing the opening of Midnight Suns last week, I saw precisely one scenario that had any kind of per cent number attached to it – and that was booting a goon (100%) or Venom, one of the newly confirmed villains of the game (0%), off a rooftop. All your other attacks, represented here as a deck of cards, are guaranteed hits.\nIt’s a strategic evolution I’ll talk about in a second, but this switch-up in approach isn’t the only part of Midnight Suns story that’s been subject to the whims of (mis)fortune. No sooner had Firaxis announced the game it was delayed in the snap of Thanos' fingers (from March to the second half of 2022, now confirmed as October 7th at tonight’s Summer Game Fest). But speaking to creative director Jake Solomon, the extra polishing time they set aside gave them an unexpected benefit. And it’s all down to a fish witch called Wanda.\nRead more",

It's a very interesting laptop and well thought out for Linux use with an AMD Ryzen 7 PRO 5850U SoC and integrated Radeon graphics for satisfying the preferences of many Linux developers preferring a fully open-source driver stack. Thanks to the large scale manufacturing of HP, it's also a competitively-priced Linux laptop compared to many of the Linux laptops from smaller vendors that are based on Clevo or other white box laptop designs.",

It's been a trip! \"E3 2022\" has been trying at times, but now is the time to share your favorite reveal of this past week.\nFor me, it was the Persona on Xbox announcement. The fact that this trio of killer games is coming to PC [beyond what we already got], Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Game Pass, is pretty huge news. Although they're older releases (well, Royal technically isn't that old), it's a trifecta announcement: so I'm kind of cheating here.\nIt's just lovely to see this series live on, on as many platforms as possible. I can still recall the first time I played Persona 2 with my cousin; huddled away in my relative's house: never realizing how big this series would one day get. I watched Persona 3 claw its way onto the PSP after a PS2 release, and now, it's coming to Xbox consoles, potentially before PS5 and Switch. That's wild!\nA bit of housekeeping for what's on the horizon. So to be clear, all the major showcases are done as of this afternoon. The next stream is the Capcom showcase at 6PM ET tomorrow, followed by the 10-minute FF7 celebration shindig on June 16. Oh and if Nintendo plans a surprise Direct next week, there's that. You can find a list of confirmed streams here.\nBut again, as of today, what was your favorite reveal? As a reminder, here is what some of us wanted to see.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QESuddo8afY\nThe post Now that the major “E3” streams are done, what was your favorite reveal? appeared first on Destructoid.",

Oops.\nAnyway, those who have been waiting to dive into its gory gaslit world will be pleased to hear that Gloomwood finally has an Early Access date, and will be opening its creaky wooden doors on Steam come August 16. Gloomwood's stealth 'n' slash action will come as snug entertainment to those who enjoyed that '90s Thief titles, which clearly presented a form of inspiration to the New Blood devs.\nIn between all the creeping and cranium-axing, players can also indulge in a spot of suitcase arranging, ala Resident Evil 4, which as fans know is almost a compelling game in and of itself. If this is your first time hearing about Gloomwood, then be sure to check out the trailer below to get yourself up to speed on New Blood's latest old-school-cool release. Check out the trailer below, which features several titles from the New Blood catalog along with some e-e-edgy comedy.\nGloomwood goes live on Steam Early Access August 16.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVhs6wG0dUA\nThe post Gothic ‘n’ gory Gloomwood hits Early Access August 16 appeared first on Destructoid.",

That alone has me intrigued! PC Gamer, says that it's a \"tragicomedy,\" and is a self-aware parody at points, with elements of Stanley Parable and Portal.\nDescribed as a series of \"puzzles and gags,\" in Backfirewall you'll explore various bits of the OS, including different types of apps, to swipe through the narrative. Apparently there are shades of Toy Story afoot, with the intent of having players ponder the inner workings and feelings of an OS. You'll become attached to OS9, as the OS10 update arrives: and decide what to do from there.\nCreative drector Julia Jean had this to say about the premise: \"We want players to feel like they're playing inside a Pixar movie while also reflecting on the rather mindless way in which we interact with our everyday digital devices. If you think twice before you update your phone after playing Backfirewall, our job is done!\"\nIt's also one of the few games shown today in the PC Gaming Show coming to Switch! It'll arrive on PC, PS4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X later this year.

KeokeN promises \"a suspense-filled, emotion-fuelled narrative alongside music from award-winning composer Sander Van Zanten, state-of-the-art motion capture, stunning graphics and real-time ray-traced shadows and reflections, powered by Unreal Engine.\"\nAlready this summer has been jam-packed with space adventures, but it seems that Deliver Us Mars might be dialing back a little on the horror, focusing more on its exploration, adaptation, and deep adventure — not that it won't feature its own fair share of outer space peril, of course. It's not looking too bad at all, as you can see for yourself in the new trailer below.\nDeliver Us Mars launches September 27 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_v3rgzvNpE\nThe post Deliver Us Mars is entering the fast-filling interstellar adventure genre appeared first on Destructoid.",

It was officially announced at the start of this year with a thrilling new trailer, and today during the PC Gaming Show, we got to hear from the devs at Saber Interactive themselves about their experiences bring Space Marine 2 to life.\nSaber's chief creative officer Tim Willits is a developer with a ton of experience, going back to 1990's id Software days when they were making influential titles like Hexen and the ever-iconic Quake.

          "description": "You can still play the demo now\nRoughly a year ago, our own Jordan Devore gave us a pretty in-depth look at Agent 64: a GoldenEye/Perfect Dark/TimeSplitters homage from studio Replicant D6. The PC Gaming Show today gave us another look at some Agent 64 gameplay via a new trailer.\nWhile we didn't get a ton of new info, we did get some kernels due to a new piece from PC Gamer. It's \"out in early access later this year,\" and no multiplayer is re-confirmed, alongside of multiple difficulty modes. The game will feature a CRT visual filter, and some portions of the game have been shored up as a result of the 2021 alpha testing: including quicker firing control considerations, and a more arcadey feel with hip-firing. The team also reminds us that the demo is available now on Steam.\nA lack of multiplayer could be seen as a missed opportunity, but it's actually kind of refreshing in a way. I know I'll be able to just dive into this, finish it up, and put it on the shelf. In an era of endless games as a service, it's a welcome respite. \"Early access later this year\" doesn't quite grab me though!

The new title, leading on from hits Her Story and Telling Lies, will launch on PC and Xbox platforms later in 2022.\nImmortality tasks the player with uncovering the mystery behind the disappearance of failed actor Marissa Marcel, whose three uncompleted movies never saw the light of day. Utilizing groundbreaking linking mechanics, the player is tasked with finding links between scenes, using props, characters, and the scenery itself to uncover the answers hidden behind Marcel's ultimate fate.\nWhile FMV games are renowned for their limited appeal and slight player interaction, Barlow has won plaudits for finding ways to take the genre to a whole new level, bringing in interesting and novel ideas, quality performances, and compelling mysteries to hold the player's interest throughout. No doubt that Immortality will see Barlow once again make something special out of the genre's limited toolset.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzz6u650zkg\nThe post Find the branching paths to solve the cold case of Immortality appeared first on Destructoid.",

The upcoming farming simulator I Am Future is ready to change that narrative with a sunnier outlook on the end of the world. Taking place about six months after the event that supposedly ended it all, the game is full of vibrant blues and greens as nature has reclaimed the urban landscape in an area named Eden.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Fs1ACCUxgg\nI Am Future's protagonist is as optimistic as they come, too, as he is seemingly unperturbed that he's the only human as far as the eye can see. He's at least excited to get started on rebuilding, and I have to give him credit for being a man who knows what he wants. According to an article from PC Gamer, you can play I Am Future at your own pace -- there's no one to answer to, no grinding to reach the top of the proverbial pile. It's farming, building, and good vibes, and I honestly couldn't be more here for it.\nI Am Future is set to release for PC sometime in 2022.\nThe post Rebuild a beautiful post apocalypse in I Am Future appeared first on Destructoid.",

He mused on how primitive the old UI was for the original, and the \"unfortunate\" nature of the modern era not really seeing the influence of System Shock.\nHe also told PC Gamer the following:\n\"I think of myself, as much as anything, as a relentless advocate for a particular kind of game, the genre we call immersive simulation. Games that are designed to let the player feel—basically force the player to feel—like it's them in the world, with as few distractions and 'game-y' things as possible. System Shock was really, at the time, the most advanced version of that, and I can't tell you how much the team is responsible for that.\"\n\nIt's still due out on PC, PS4/PS5, Xbox One/Xbox Series X.

Here's a quick roundup of what to expect from PC Gamer:\n\"Despite being known as a 4X developer, Humankind and Endless Space's Amplitude Studios also knows its way around a tactical roguelite. 2014's Dungeon of the Endless zoomed in on the Endless sci-fi universe, creating random adventures through monster-infested dungeons instead of tales of galactic-scale conquest and intrigue. And while Amplitude isn't calling it a direct sequel [it] has that same spirit.\"\n\nYep! It seems to be a loose follow-up of sorts to Dungeon of the Endless, which some of you folks may have heard about.

Based on the 1964 Polish novel of the same name, Stanisław Lem's work of hard sci-fi was at the forefront of commentary on microrobots and swarm intelligence. It's giving Firewatch meets Annihilation vibes, and that makes for a pretty cool video game premise if you ask me.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13nRHDoUz6s\nThe game was announced last year, but this is the first time we've gotten a good look at some gameplay -- what we saw today at the PC Gaming Showcase was an early beta build of the game. We saw scientist Yasna as she navigates an unknown planet in an attempt to recover the equipment from a previous expedition, and of course, things don't quite go according to plan.

It's out on September 20, 2022.

Even if this ends up being \"Three Kingdoms Nioh,\" I'm so here for it.\nXbox boss Phil Spencer says it was \"exciting to work with Team Ninja\" for this collaboration. It's been exciting to see Team Ninja rise to the occasion in recent years, myself!  Following quite a few fumbles, most notably Yaiba: Ninja Gaiden Z, one of their lowest points, they knocked it out of the park with Nioh just three years later. After that they continued to assist in various Warriors games, and gave us Nioh 2, as well as Ultimate Alliance 3. The Ninja Gaiden: Master Collection reminded us of their storied history, and Stranger of Paradise, while polarizing, was interesting from an action perspective.\nNow we have Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty next year.

Rotwood is a multiplayer action game, and it's expected to enter early access at some point, but that date is up in the air for now.\n\n\nThanks to the Steam description, we know a little more about Rotwood than what was revealed in the trailer. It's a roguelike dungeon crawler designed to be played with up to four people. Each run will bring your cute animal avatars through a dangerous forest where the challenge amplifies the deeper you go in. New armor and weapons can be crafted from items scavenged, and a safe haven can be built up and fortified as well.\nIn typical Klei style, the hand-drawn look of the characters and enemies is unreal. Once again, the studio is pushing the boundaries of making it look like you're controlling a cartoon character; Rotwood's models are expressive, fluid, and bursting with personality. I can't wait to see what Rotwood looks and plays like in action when I can eventually get my hands on it.\nThe trailer gave an early access date of \"202?\" which could be anytime in the next decade, though I'd expect us to play it well before 2030. Rotwood can be wishlisted on Steam, and it's unknown whether Klei is planning for release on any additional platforms at this time.",

The Alters is a sci-fi adventure where one man trying to survive and get home from a mission that's gone wrong finds all the help he needs in himself. Or rather, himselves.\n\n\n \nJan Dolski, the main character, turns to The Alters, or alternate versions of himself that differ from him in ways that will help them all survive. The Alters each have different skills and character traits, so even though they all look like Jan, they'll fill specific roles in the mission to get home. The trailer shows Jan and The Alters' ship, a giant wheel-like craft with a series of shipping container units held together at the center.\nDuring the presentation, 11 Bit Studios' Lead Artist Tomasz Kisikewicz says the game has aspects of a psychological thriller, with a dash of horror, but also obviously deals with surrealism. He also says this lands in a \"classic sci-fi\" story by taking a relatable topic and applying these fictional science solutions like creating alternate selves, but the gameplay is contemporary with a focus on system design and non-linear gameplay. It's designed for players to create their own stories.\n \n\nIt seems like it's far too early for a release date, but we do know The Alters will be coming to PC whenever it does end up launching.",

The tech of The Invincible is retro-futuristic, which gives the rundown facility and gadgets Yasna uses a lot of character and charm. Yasna pulls out a handheld tracker with a field of tiny lights and uses it to discover a body buried in the sands beneath her feet, confirming this place isn't at all safe. Then, the antimatter cannon surges to life, takes aim, and blows the robot worker away with a spectacular beam of particles before turning its sights dead on our protagonist.\nI'm not usually one for slow-paced first-person narrative games, but this look at The Invincible had me on the edge of my seat, and I can't wait to see more. The Invincible is coming sometime in 2023 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

It is coming to Xbox consoles and PC this November. \nRevealed during today’s Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase, Pentiment looks like quite the departure from what Obsidian has released over the past few years. Nonetheless, the project looks fascinating. The game features quite a unique visual style that looks reminiscent of an old medieval painting or book. This makes sense, too, because Pentiment is not an RPG like The Outer Worlds or a survival game like the studio’s Grounded, but rather, a narrative adventure game. \nCheck out the trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nHere’s how Xbox describes Pentiment in the YouTube trailer description: \n“Set in 16th century Bavaria, Pentiment will take players on a narrative journey through the eyes of Journeyman Artist Andreas Maler during a time of great social unrest. Led by game director Josh Sawyer, this game is brought to life by a talented team inspired by illuminated manuscripts, woodcut prints, and history itself.” \nPentiment hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC this November. \nWhile waiting for its release, read Game Informer’s review of The Outer Worlds and then read about Obsidian’s next RPG, Avowed.\nAre you excited for Pentiment?

During the platform's Summer Game Fest event today, we got our first glimpse at a new project from Limbo and Inside lead designer Jeppe Carlsen.\nCocoon, published by Annapurna Interactive, which has a showcase of its own next month, promises to be a mind-bending experience with an undeniably compelling art style. The creators promise to take players \"on an adventure across worlds within worlds,\" which are represented by a series of unusual glowing orbs in the trailer. The clip begins with a sweeping and stylized view of a desert landscape which is soon disturbed by a blinding beam of white light. Our hero pops out of a mechanical-looking cocoon energized by the laser and appears to be a kind of beetle. We mostly see it grabbing and distributing globes of various colors, which may allow it to jump to different locations.\n\n\n There's not a lot to glean from this reveal trailer, but the game's Steam page goes into a little more detail. \nCocoon is set to release on Xbox consoles (via Game Pass), Switch, and PC sometime in 2023. The trailer's description indicates fans should get ready to \"master world-leaping mechanics to unravel a cosmic mystery.\"",

Giger, Scorn features some of the same disconcerting imagery that is a part of the art from movies like Alien, in which biological and mechanical elements seem to merge.\nThe new trailer continues to embrace those elements, with more than a little bit of body horror mixed in for good measure. The video shows numerous instances of disconnected human appendages attached to strange, non-human machines and creatures. And the protagonist appears to be horribly mutilated in the brief glimpses we get of their arms and other body parts.\nEbb has stated in the past that Scorn is aiming for a cohesive “lived-in” world, in which players are thrown in the deep-end by arriving and having to try and grasp what is even happening in the spaces they explore. Environments are said to be maze-like and individual regions are open and exploreable, but interconnected with other distinct spaces.\nThe developers are also touting the game’s focus on full-body awareness. Rather than have items simply floating in the world and having them picked up by magic, every object is a real thing that your character must lift or move with their own hands, hopefully leading to a greater sense of immersion. And, given the subject matter, a likely greater sense of disquiet.\nWhile the environment and creature design is certainly impressive, I continue to have a number of questions about the nature of gameplay in the project. I’m eager to understand more about the nature of the puzzles and characters that are part of the surreal game world, but this latest trailer does little to illuminate either.\nScorn is headed to Xbox Game Pass, but more generally will be available on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, and on the Cloud when it releases on October 21, 2022.",

Today, at the Xbox Games Showcase, it was not only confirmed, but a high-speed trailer featuring the toy cars from our childhoods whizzed across the screen on the tracks and red loops we've come to know. You can watch the trailer above. The expansion hits on July 19. \nPREVIOUS STORY\nAccording to Eurogamer, Forza Horizon 5’s first expansion – a Hot Wheels crossover – leaked on the Steam store listing and was immediately taken down. The listing was posted to Reddit, where it gained traction. You can see the image of the crossover below. \nThis wouldn’t be the first time the two car-racing giants joined forces. Hot Wheels DLC packages sped onto the scenic tracks of Forza Motorsport 5 and Forza Horizon 3 and 4. What Playground Games has in store with its latest arcade racing simulator is anyone’s guess. \nForza Horizon 5 cracked Game Informer’s Top 10 Games of 2021 list: \n“To merely say Forza Horizon 5 is among the most mechanically sound racing games ever created would be a disservice and overlook what makes the game worthy of praise. Yes, the foundational act of driving feels fantastic, but it’s the rest of the package that truly elevates this fifth entry in the series to the rarified air that demands a place on our list of the top 10 games of the year.”\nAre you excited about the alleged crossover?\n[Source: Eurogamer]",

The publisher had plenty to show from the hero shooter, including a new character and the announcement of the day it'll enter Early Access, October 4.\n\n\nWhen it hits Early Access, Overwatch 2's PvP content will be free-to-play, giving players who want to play matches with or against friends the chance to do so at no cost. It'll also have a new character called The Junker Queen who got her own cinematic trailer, introducing her Mad-Max-meets-punk-rock persona in a handicap match against some nasty-looking fellas. The Junker Queen uses an ax and shotgun to tear through other heroes on the OW battlefield. We'll learn more about her on June 16, when Blizzard holds an Overwatch 2 reveal event.\nBlizzard promises regular content updates for Overwatch 2, including new maps, modes, heroes, and even more. Also, because this showed up on the Xbox showcase doesn't mean the information above isn't any less true for the other platforms OW2 is planned to launch on. Overwatch 2 will hit Early Access on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC at the same time.",

She isn't alone in her pursuit and is joined by a blue, mystical fox named Enki. Today's Xbox Games Showcase gave us an advanced look at this 2023 action/RPG, showing off traversal, combat, boss fights, and more. \nIn many sequences, we see Nor and Enki in the middle of vast battlefields, using a variety of weapons and magics to dispose of any soldier or beast that stands in their way. The footage is impressive, both in scale and the level of detail in the worlds. Nor and Enki appear to have swift aerial traversal means to get across terrain quickly.

Among looks at Elder Scrolls Online and a recap on Redfall, which kicked the event off in style, the Bethesda exec revealed a new expansion for Fallout 76. The company's online multiplayer game had a rough start, but Bethesda has continued to work on its title, with several story expansions and updates to the game's world. However, this is the first update we've had for the title in a while, as the last major expansion came last year.\nThe Pitt's story will take place in post-war Pittsburgh, a location we haven't seen since Fallout 3. Described as \"a grim industrial wasteland crippled by conflict,\" players will be teaming up with the Union, a band of mechanically skilled fighters seeking to rid their home of raiders that have taken over called the Fanatics. This task will be made even harder by the fact that The Pitt's toxic wasteland is warping the mind of its inhabitants. \n\n\nFallout 76's Expeditions: The Pitt is coming this September.",

The story shows the destruction of a village and the rebirth of a new land thanks to some heroic deeds of friendship, bravery, and more. According to the trailer, the game tells the story of a united overworld, and that overworld is to be united by none other than you, the player. \nCheck out the reveal trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Legends is quite the departure from the typical Minecraft formula. Breaking away from the survival crafting mold the series has held for over a decade, similar to what Minecraft Dungeons did in 2020, Legends will be the first action strategy game in Mojang’s blocky world. It also features a unique spin on the traditional Minecraft visuals.\nIt retains the blockiness fans of Minecraft have come to know and love, but with a more distinct, almost comic book-ey style. It looks great, and fortunately, we don’t have to wait too long to play it because it hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC sometime next year. \nWhile waiting for Minecraft Legends, read Game Informer’s Minecraft Dungeons review. \nAre you excited about Minecraft Legends?

These places look like they could be safe havens, but we quickly see guards expanding their search and are everywhere.\nThe new footage shows stealth maneuvers captured in striking detail. We see Amicia hiding under a table to evade a patrol and being surprisingly aggressive, using weapons to silently take out guards. We also see her use fire to create a blaze that will surely draw out every guard in the area.\nOf course, Hugo's curse doesn't remain dormant for long and a flood of rats appears to keep him safe.

          "description": "Early in today’s Xbox Game Showcase, Riot Games’ president, Marc Merrill, took a few minutes to announce a big new partnership with Xbox and its Game Pass program. A number of Riot’s biggest experiences are coming to Xbox Game Pass on mobile and PC, with relatively robust options unlocked for players to enjoy.\nFirst, Riot’s flagship property, League of Legends, will see all champions unlocked on PC.\nIn League of Legends: Wild Rift, it’s a similar picture, with all champions unlocked on mobile gaming platforms.\nIn Legends of Runeterra, Game Pass players can expect to have the full Foundations set of cards unlocked. For those not in the know, as the name implies, that’s the foundational cards for the game, establishing the base mechanics. The card set will be available on both PC and mobile.\nIn Teamfight Tactics, players can expect select Little Legends to be unlocked, whether you play on PC or mobile.\nAnd in Valorant, all agents will be unlocked on PC.\nIt’s a notable team-up that should give a boost to both Xbox and Riot. On the Riot side, the availability of so many characters and sets across the spectrum of their games means that a potentially huge audience of Xbox players could have a chance to experience a broad spectrum of what each of those games have to offer. To Xbox’s benefit, it offers a meaningful boost to the already potent draw of Xbox Games Pass as a service and experience, since players can gain access to a number of aspects of each of those Riot games without needing to pay additional costs.\nWhile Riot’s expansion into Game Pass is big news, it’s worth noting that it won’t have much effect for players on Xbox consoles, as all the available options are coming to specific combinations of PC and mobile, depending on titles.\nThe availability of all of these options is said to be coming this winter for Game Pass subscribers.",

The studio calls it the “most technologically advanced racing game ever made.” To highlight these technological advances, the team showcased Maple Valley, a fan-favorite track alongside news that the game will have a dynamic day-and-night cycle, a first for the Motorsport series.\nCheck out the reveal trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nNot to be confused with Playground Games’ Forza Horizon series, Motorsport is closer to a racing sim than it is an arcade racer, making it an especially great time for people who really like to get under the hood of the vehicles they race. To go with that, there’s plenty of environment tech happening in Forza Motorsport to simulate not just how the cars would drive, but how the time of day, the temperature associated with it, and more can affect the race. \nCheck out this demo trailer for more information about that: \n\n\nAll of it looks great thanks to ray-tracing, photorealism techniques, and more.

It’s appropriately poppy and colorful, too, and it looks like a great time. Plus, we don’t have to wait too long to play it because it hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC (via Steam and the Epic Games Store) later this year. \n“After a cartel of aliens invades Earth, a freshly minted high-school graduate grabs the nearest talking gun and becomes the deadliest intergalactic bounty hunter across the cosmos,” a press release reads. “The alien invaders in High On Life are on a mission to dominate Earth, but with a particularly sinister twist: Garmantuous and his cartel goons are intent on enslaving humanity and using them as a new drug.\n“[Defeating] powerful aliens isn’t going to be easy; bounty hunters will work with (or against) NPCs, collect upgrades, and acquire an arsenal of talking guns on their journey. Each of these guns has its own unique personality and special gameplay, and they provide their own narrative take on what’s going on.” \n\nSquanch Games’ studio director Mike Fridley says to expect Roiland’s comedic voice to tie this game together with all of the studio’s other outputs. He says the studio wants players to look at any of its games and immediately know it’s a Squanch game. \n“I wanted to make games that I wanted to play, and that was the spark that sort of lit the fire of Squanch Games,” Roiland writes in a press release. “Then we shipped Trover, we shipped Accounting+, and now we’re on this absolute dream game that we were kind of building towards this whole time.” \nFor more, read Game Informer’s Trover Saves The Universe review and catch up on all the biggest gaming news from Summer Game Fest 2022 and other June showcases. \nAre you excited about High On Life?

Developer Draw Distance is taking that concept and expanding on it further with Serial Cleaners, offering more ways to play and even more gruesome crimes to cover up.\n\n\nUnlike its 70s-inspired predecessor, Serial Cleaners pulls from pop culture of the 1990s, including Quinten Tarantino's body of work and other classic action and crime thrillers of the era. Once again, stealth is core to the experience; you can't let the authorities know what happened at each crime scene. Serial Cleaners brings four characters to mop up blood, bodies, and clues, each handling business in their own way. Players will utilize these new cleaners' street smarts, tech, brute force, or classic know-how to get the job done.\nIf you're ready to aid and abet in some gnarly virtual killings, Serial Cleaners is set to release on September 22 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.",

          "description": "We got a new look today at Arctic Awakening, the upcoming first-person narrative game from GoldFire Studios. Players control Kai, a cargo pilot who was on a relatively routine supply delivery to a small Alaskan town with his partner, when their plane goes down in the middle of nowhere. Donovan, the co-pilot, is lost out in the cold and snowy wastes, and Kai sets out to find him.\nAs Kai, you must explore the freezing cold wilds, and the environment is a constant threat. The game is set in April of 2062, so there are a few things that are a bit different than one might expect to find in a modern-day setting, including a court-mandated therapy bot that is along with you on your journey. The AI drone has no shortage of pithy commentary to share with you as you navigate the wilderness, but has little in the way of helpful tools or weapons that might aid in your survival efforts.\nBeyond the exploration elements, Arctic Awakening focuses on narrative choice, and the way those choices shift the relationships and situations of the characters around you. The decisions you make also affect the way the game ends.\nBeyond narrative elements, GoldFire Studios is promising dynamic weather that shifts over time, meaning even areas you’ve visited already may be different when you return to them a second time.\nAs Kai explores, it becomes increasingly apparent that something more sinister is going on out there in the wilderness. High-tech facilities and mysterious technology is everywhere, providing a sense of mystery tinged with terror.\nArctic Awakening is targeting launch on consoles, PC, and Mac something in 2023. It will be released as a collection of five 60-90 minute chapters for players to take on at their own pace.",

          "description": "Today’s Future Games Show gave us a new look at Bramble: The Mountain King, a visually arresting upcoming game from Dimfrost Studio. Players control a young protagonist named Olle as he as he explores a world of misty Nordic fairy tales in a forbidding wilderness, and the strange and deadly creatures that crop up along the way. His journey is motivated by a hope to rescues his lost sister.\nThe studio is aiming to offer a compelling juxtaposition of beautiful natural environments and sudden, horrifying moments of danger – all reflected in high-quality visuals. That goal is clearly presented in the game’s footage, which has an attractive and lush art style that immediately captures the mood.\nThe studio describes a focus on “David vs. Goliath” bosses as you explore nature. As an illustration of the concept, the new trailer discusses the strange creature called the Näcken, perhaps inspired by the myth of the Nykr. In the game, the Näcken plays its magical violin from its watery home, and lures people to their deaths by drowning in the lake. He was once a normal man who was terribly bullied by those around him, who eventually snapped and killed everyone close to him – including the girl that he loved.\nBased on the description explored in the trailer, it’s clear that Dimfrost is interested in exploring the backstories and foundational elements of each monster’s narratives as part of the unfolding game. The Näcken is just one of many strange creatures that players encounter in the game.\nThe footage reveals the young explorer navigating creepy 3D environments, often as imposing giant creatures lurk in the background. Gameplay is said to focus on puzzle-solving and platforming.\nDimfrost Studio is previously known for its work creating the 2017 release, A Writer And His Daughter, a VR exploration game.\nBramble: The Mountain King is on the way to PC and consoles later in 2022.",

          "description": "Kumi Souls Games has been rather quiet on social media about its upcoming gothic-horror action game The Last Faith, but as part of the Future Games Show presentation, we were able to see how it's shaping up. The fresh footage shows Belmont-esque protagonist Eric as he brutalizes everything in his path, destroying plenty of beautifully drawn monsters, and faces off against a towering and salivating hydra beast.\nThe Last Faith borrows heavily from Castlevania and games like Dark souls, offering what looks to be a tough, violent affair. Eric has plenty of weapons and attacks in his arsenal including a fiery haymaker punch, a shocking electrified blade, and a shotgun to keep the enemies in check at mid-range. He also utilizes gruesome execution moves to take foes down for good; it's strangely impressive how gross some details of these attacks come off in the pixel low-rez art.\nFollowing a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2020, Kumi Souls Games have been hard at work on the 2D action game. Since then, publisher Playstack has picked up The Last Faith for distribution, and the final game is starting to come together.\nWe don't have an exact release date for The Last Faith quite yet, but the trailer does solidify a 2022 launch target on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.",

Beginning today, Beta 2 kicks off on Steam Early Access and Xbox Game Preview. This larger test features 12 courses, eight-player online multiplayer (with crossplay), single-player time trials, and improvements based on feedback from Beta 1. Leveling up during Beta 2 unlocks exclusive cosmetic wheels, an avatar, and a spoiler for the final game.

          "description": "After an extended period of time, we're finally ready to announce that the game Chewy: ESC From F5 is ready for testing. This quirky game features the protagonist Chewy as he tries to outwit the evil Borks. Escaping from their high security zone, F5, will just be the start of his adventure.\nIf any of you have the game and are willing to test it out, we'll welcome any feedback. You will need a daily development build. As always, please submit the bug reports to our issue tracker. \nPlease note that the ScummVM version does have one major outstanding issue: the music used by the game is in a custom format we've been unable to properly support yet. So only sound effects and speech currently work at this time.\n>",

          "description": "A few days ago, Google announced the list of students accepted for this year's Google Summer of Code.\nWe are very proud to welcome 4 students this year who will be working on various parts of the project during the upcoming months.\nPragyansh Chaturvedi (aka Raikou) will work on improving our DIRECTOR engine. His effort will help us to allow support for many 90s-era adventure games made with the Macromedia Director authoring tools. By implementing more internal functions used by DIRECTOR, Pragyansh's main objective is to extend support for Meet Mediaband and The Journeyman Project (Win and Mac), making them fully playable without any glitches.\nMichael Hayman (aka Quote58) is about to implement support for The Immortal. The game (released in 1990) can be described as a mix of genres involving RPG elements with action and puzzles. Many changes across different game variants (written in pure assembly code!) will make this an interesting challenge. This project is a continuation of a GSoC task initially started by a former student back in 2018.\nEmanuele Grisenti (aka grisenti) will be working on a new engine, HPL1. The original sources for this engine got recently released by the original developer Frictional Games under GPLv3. The purpose of this project is to achieve a full port of this engine to ScummVM, with the goal of supporting the 2007 survival game Penumbra: Overture.\nAvijeet Maurya (aka StableSteady) will pick up several incomplete engines: MacVenture, Avalanche, Glk-Scott, Pink and WAGE. Some of these engines are very close to completion, but not quite there yet. The main objective of Avijeet's task is to identify all missing features and fix existing bugs. The goal for his project is to bring the above engines to a stable state.\nThe team is very excited about the upcoming weeks – and we hope you are as well.\nPlease give a warm welcome to our new students! Let's make GSoC 2022 a huge success – together!\n>",
