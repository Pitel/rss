Yet it’s generally in good shape, both for early access and a solo developer project, successfully balancing strong visuals with relatively light hardware demands that should help it run on older PCs (or handhelds like the Steam Deck). Several hours in, the ugliest things I’ve seen are my road layouts.\nRead more",

This you pulverise, in a downward direction, with the aim of finding a huge chest of gems at the bottom somewhere. Your drill is the machine gun on your ship, your efforts governed by about two minutes worth of depleting fuel and a hull that can take three hits total. It's cyberpunk by Gimli.\nRead more",

Called The Rogue Prince Of Persia, a name choice that makes it sound a bit like an illegal knockoff being sold out of the back of Evil Empire's Peugeot, I got to have a go of about 45 minutes of it last week. It's 2D, side on platforming, and super colourful. Think Dead Cells skinned as a kids cartoon with a branded cereal tie-in, extremely cool music, and an emphasis on wall running. It's mobile even by the standards of a platformer, in fact, and is entering Steam early access on May the 14th. \nRead more",

Rather than simply building on the previous game's premise of a Hamlet's worth of upgradeable, derangeable heroes venturing into tabletop RPG-style labyrinths, it stripped away Darkest Dungeon's skin and moved its bones and organs around to create a gruelling roguelike. Well, developers Red Hook appear to have done it again with Darkest Dungeon 2's free Kingdoms mode, out later this year, which slices open Darkest Dungeon 2's hide and recomposes it into a turn-based strategy boardgame, where you defend a world map against encroaching eldritch creatures.\nRead more",

          "description": "Drop Bear Bytes, the studio behind post-apocalyptic RPG Broken Roads, are named after Australia’s deadliest creature. The Drop Bear might look like a normal koala, but they’re actually dangerous predators, fond of jumping from trees to maul unsuspecting chumps who forget to take adequate precautions, like urinating on themselves. Really, the story is a wind-up the aussies like to blag tourists with. If it looks like a koala, it’s just a koala. But it’s this sort of character, inspired by love for Australia’s unique landscape, culture and good-natured mick-taking, that forms the heart of the best bits in Broken Roads. I say ‘best bits’, but I should probably say ‘the only bits that I actually enjoyed’, unfortunately.\nBombs wiped out 80% of Australia’s population, and left the remaining nail-hard Nancys and tough Tobiases to fend for themselves in a world short of resources, but shockingly plentiful in both guns and pre-made Vegemite sarnies. You’ll pick one of four character classes - I went with ‘Jackaroo’ (cattle hand), because it was called ‘Jackaroo’ - before tackling a short tutorial section. You'll then be thrust into some events, where you’ll meet the rest of your starting party and kick off the game proper.\n \nRead more",

Stepping into the be-grimed trainers and unwashed jacket of the protagonist - a misused girl whose vibe is that of a member of Gorillaz - you shoot a single bullet from your gun and control it in first-person as you zip it through the heads, hearts and hands of cultists placed around a level.

          "description": "When Bethesda was working out how to turn their popular Elder Scrolls RPGs into an online behemoth to rival World Of Warcraft back in the late 00s, the initial pitch was \"Elder Scrolls with friends,\" creative director Rich Lambert tells me. A simple idea on paper, perhaps, but one that proved to be a lot more complicated in the realisation of it. Zenimax Online Studios was founded in 2007, a year after The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion landed to universal critical praise, but it wasn't until seven years later that The Elder Scrolls Online finally released for PC in 2014. At launch \"we were walking this weird line between 'online game' and 'Elder Scrolls game',\" Lambert says. \"We didn't do either of them particularly well.\"\nTen years later, though, The Elder Scrolls Online is thriving. At last count, the game has over 24 million players galloping about the plains of Tamriel, and later this June, it will receive its eighth major Chapter expansion, Gold Road, which adds Oblivion's West Weald to the game and wraps up the mystery of the new Daedric Prince that arrived at the end of the previous expansion, Necrom. But the path ESO has taken to get here hasn't been nearly as glittering, with its PC launch in particular generating \"a lot of feedback\", as studio director Matt Firor told press at the game's tenth anniversary event last week. In fact, it wasn't until ESO came to consoles in 2015 that the game really found its voice, says Lambert. \"We had to really figure out what we wanted to be, and we chose 'Elder Scrolls'. As soon as we hit that core pillar of 'It's Elder Scrolls first, online second,' then it really just helped inform everything we've done since.\" Trouble is, when the thrust of ESO's development straddled the launch of two very different Elder Scrolls games, even nailing down that first part of the pillar proved to be more challenging than expected.\nRead more",

But Botany Manor is much less eldritch, and much more gentle historical feel-good movie starring Emma Thompson in the lead role. That role - which in this case is played by you in first person rather than La Thompson - is of Arabella Greene, a retired botanist who, thank God, is the childless inheritor of a huge manor and ancestral wealth, and so is able to spend the sunny days of 1890 pottering around the house and grounds researching weird, slightly fantastical plants almost wholly untroubled. So in this respect it is also a fantasy game. It's quite delightful, which is the sort of phrase I am confident Arabella would use.\nRead more",

          "description": "According to one unofficial tracker created by video game artist Farhan Noor, there have been 8000 layoffs in 2024 so far, following an estimated 10,500 layoffs in 2023. The leaders of Microsoft, Embracer Group, Epic and other industry giants have made swingeing cuts to their workforces. While larger companies have inevitably seen the largest reductions, many smaller developers and publishers have also cut staff or even closed their doors. Circumstances vary by company, of course, but as regards the biggest publishers, there are some broad overlapping causes: reckless or, if you prefer, \"overambitious\" expansion and overhiring during the pandemic lockdown gaming boom; lower-than-hoped returns on new technologies and business models such as NFTs; and rising global interest rates, which have scared away potential investors.\nThe carnage was uppermost in Larian CEO's Swen Vincke's mind when he accepted Baldur's Gate 3's Best Narrative gong at the GDC Awards last month. According to Vincke, the layoffs can be traced straightforwardly to a pattern of executive greed that sees company leadership betting the livelihoods and stability of their workers on whatever new idea seems capable of delivering instant growth for shareholders.\n Read more",

So you'll mostly be toiling, and foraging, and genuinely having way more actual skills than us superior modern folk. And despite some UI issues and rough edges, it's weirdly compelling.\nRead more",

          "description": "Friends! Jaegers! Evas! Lend me your radar dishes or cybernetic ear trumpets. Developers Storm Trident and publishers Forever Entertainment have popped up a Steam demo for their Front Mission 2 remake. Tucked within its coils there are two whole levels, Rimian Base and Batari Forest, together with a Garage where you can customise your Wanzer and access to the in-game Network menu.\r\n\n\r\n\"Who are you calling a Wanzer?\" you bellow. Calm down and stop waving that chair. A wanzer is a mech, in short. And Front Mission, by the way, is a 90s tactical RPG series from G-Craft and Square, both of which have since been assimilated into the terrifying robot octopus that is present-day Square Enix. Much as with Final Fantasy Tactics games, Front Mission games are stagey political thrillers about countries and corporations and other factions waging perpetual war upon each other, with players thrust into the mix as mech squad leaders. \r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Yesterday, if you can believe it, marked the tenth anniversary of The Elder Scrolls Online. That's a whole decade of tromping across Tamriel with your mates, and a whole decade in which I've watched tentatively from the sidelines, thinking about dipping my toes into the MMO pool, but never quite building up the courage (or lining the walls of my bank account) to fully take the plunge. I've heard all the horror stories about starting a new MMO from other members of the RPS Treehouse - particularly when it comes to the lore-laden shackles of World Of Warcraft and the bloated MMO-service-hybrid Destiny - and quite honestly, it's enough to put me off them all entirely. But The Elder Scrolls Online might just be the exception to the rule.\nI spent a portion of the game's tenth birthday yesterday playing Gold Road, its upcoming eighth Chapter expansion. In it, you're whisked over to the West Weald, an autumnal, sun-dappled region whose main city hub, Skingrad, will no doubt feel familiar to seasoned Oblivionites. Seemingly overnight, a strange jungle has sprung up on the city's outskirts, uprooting the nearby villages of the neighbouring high elves and causing havoc as strange beasts pour out of its curling root beds. There are more mysteries to unravel here, too, including the emergence of the new Daedric Prince, Ithelia (revealed at the end of last year's Necrom Chapter), and much more besides - too much to realistically take in during a 90-minute preview session, or for this MMO newbie to fully comprehend the significance of. But there's something about Gold Road and its gnarled-up jungles, strange cults and fantastical beasts that's definitely made me want to make a return journey here when it launches on PC on June 3rd.\nRead more",

Across the entire breadth of Roblox game makers, a lot of money is made. At the individual level, however, the vast majority of creators making work within Roblox never earn enough to cash out their earnings - and some of those creators are children. This has long led to allegations that Roblox is exploiting child labour, generating value for Roblox Studio and its shareholders in the process.\r\n\n\"I don't know, you can say this for a lot of things, right?\" said Roblox Studio head Stefano Corazza at GDC, when the allegation was put to him by Eurogamer. \"Like, you can say, 'Okay, we are exploiting, you know, child labour,' right? Or, you can say: we are offering people anywhere in the world the capability to get a job, and even like an income.

All while costing \"a fraction\" of the NVIDIA H100. Gaudi 3 sounds quite promising and will be interesting to see how its adopted in the marketplace.

If you've not been playing the game, however, you have missed out on some of them. Don't worry, though, as there is a trick to help you get them. \n\n\nAfter a certain time period, they will become hidden from the in-game store, which may make you think that's you've missed the boat entirely and can't get them anymore. In a post on Reddit, however, user CheekiPosts reminded players that if you go to the Charms, Decals, or Stickers section of your loadout, you can still grab the bundles from there. \n\n\nGet yourself some free bundles. Image via Activision\n\n\nWhen you go to the the section, such as Charms, it will show all the free items in that category, even if you don't have it yet. Once you click on it, you'll be able to see and unlock the bundle, even if it's not in the store. \n\n\nThis is a very useful trick that many people may know, but personally, I didn't know this was a thing. I lived under the assumption that if I hadn't played in a while and didn't unlock the bundle when it was in the store, it was just \"too bad\" and you move on. I went and tried this out though and added two new bundles to my inventory though, so I'm thankful to have seen this helpful hint. \n\n\nThis doesn't apply to bundles that you purchase with CoD Points or real money in-game though, as once they are out of the store, all you can do is hope that Activision bring them back in the future. \n\nThe post This clever MW3 trick lets you get free cosmetic items you may have missed appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Couch co-op games offer some of the best gaming experiences, especially in the competitive Fortnite Battle Royale. However, a system issue may disrupt these collaborative matches. Here's how to fix the split screen not working in Fortnite. \n\n\nFortnite split screen not working solution\n\n\nEpic Games has temporarily disabled split-screen gameplay due to an issue with matchmaking. This problem has been ongoing since April 9, 2024. The only solution is to wait for a new patch and install the update. However, the good news is that the team has recently announced that an update is on its way. \n\n\n\n\nThe split-screen Fortnite issue has surfaced in the past, but a swift resolution has often accompanied a new update. Therefore, it's important to stay vigilant for new patches or stay informed through the Fortnite Status channel. If the problem persists even after an update, ensure your internet connection is stable. The official Epic Games website states that split-screen gameplay requires a stable internet connection. You may also need a quick restart of the game to get it working properly. \n\n\nThe new Fortnite updates brought up some problems with consoles, which could be another reason why split screen isn't active. In particular, Xbox Series X|S users have been experiencing crashes. However, more updates are expected to address these errors and crashes soon. We'll be sure to update this guide once Epic Games releases the new patch to fix Fortnite's split-screen gameplay, so stay tuned. \n\nThe post How to fix split screen not working in Fortnite appeared first on Destructoid.",

Here's how to find and destroy a cabbage cart as part of Fortnite Chapter 5, Season 2's Elements quests.\n\n\nHow to destroy a cabbage cart in Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 2\n\n\nCabbage carts spawn all around Fortnite's map, with important landmarks like Pleasant Piazza, Lavish Lair, and Hazy Hillside's tunnel housing these structures. As you play your matches, keep an eye out for small market stalls with cabbage scattered around, as these are the carts you need to break for this objective.\n\n\nHowever, be careful as you search for cabbage carts. Not only do you have to watch for other players attacking you, but there's a chance someone will beat you to the location. With everyone trying to finish this quest, you'll have to race to find a cabbage cart, especially in a busy lobby. You may have to visit multiple landmarks for this structure if your first few stops have broken carts. Fortunately, you'll find numerous cabbage carts around the Fortnite map, particularly next to roads, railways, and other paths.\n\n\nIn other words, if you see other players around trying to break your cabbage carts, you'll have to prepare to defeat them. They'll be trying to find these carts, too, and may catch you by surprise if you focus on this rather than the match.\n\n\nOnce you complete the destroy a cabbage cart quest, you'll receive Chi and Water Chakra progress, bringing you one step closer to opening the Water Chakra and obtaining the Appa Glider reward. Alongside Water Chakra, you'll also find various elemental objective lists that unlock over time. Be prepared to tackle these as well, as you'll need multiple Chakras to get every reward.\n\nThe post How to find and destroy a cabbage cart in Fortnite appeared first on Destructoid.",

Since match performances can be all over the place, this acts as a good way to lengthen your time playing the serious mode.\n\n\nWith that said, we’ll break down what this feature is and how to utilize it.\n\n\nWhat Rank Protection means in Fortnite ranked\n\n\nRank Protection is a system in the game that prevents your rank from decaying when you lose your first match of the day. In a way, it’s sort of like the game is giving you a warm-up round so you won’t be discouraged if you start your play session with the negative effects of a loss.\n\n\nThis feature will be implemented automatically and will actually incentivize you to potentially rank higher. With so many variables out there that can determine your rank, this can help you shake off any cobwebs if you haven’t played ranked in a bit or when there are changes to the map.\n\n\nRank Protection can help you develop new types of strategies to get better at Fortnite. It can help you take more risks, prioritizing dropping in hot spots and learning how to adapt in multi-team battles.\n\n\nOnce this is used up, your rank will be normally affected by losses. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nWhen does Rank Protection reset?\n\n\nThis feature resets every day at 0:00 UTC (use time converters if necessary). The reset coincides with your shop reset, so that’s a good indicator of when you get another free loss.\n\n\nIt’s cool that Epic Games acknowledges that we all have bad games, and this will act as an incentive to get into or play more Ranked. \n\nThe post What Rank Protection means in Fortnite ranked matches appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Fortnite's Avatar: The Last Airbender event is in full swing, with the Elements Pass launching on April 12. As part of the collaboration, players need to earn Chi and Chakra to earn special rewards, and we can explain how to get them and what they're used for. \n\n\nBoth Chi and Chakra will be vitally important to your progression through the event, especially if you want to unlock all those sweet cosmetics before the event ends. Unfortunately, the game doesn't do a great job of making it clear what they actually do, which is where I come in. \n\n\nThere's plenty to unlock. Screenshot via Destructoid\n\n\nChi in Fortnite's Elements Pass: Explained\n\n\nIn Fortnite's Elements Pass, each element has its own set of Quests. When you complete a Quest, you will receive Chi, which is then used to unlock rewards inside the Elements Pass. \n\n\nFor the Water Chakra Quests, each challenge rewards 350 Chi. Once you earn 1,000 Chi, you can unlock a new cosmetic item on both the free track, and the Premium Reward Track if you want to unlock the Aang skin. \n\n\nEach challenges offers 350 Chi as a reward. Screenshot via Destructoid\n\n\nChakra in Fortnite's Elements Pass: Explained\n\n\nChakra is also linked to Quests, as one of the Elements Bonus Goals is how you earn them. When you complete four of the Water Chakra Quests, you will then \"Open the Water Chakra.\"\n\n\nIf you earn six Chakras throughout the duration of the Elements Pass, you will unlock the Appa Glider. So keep completing challenges, and keep an eye on your Elements Bonus Goals!\n\n\nHow much Chi do I need to unlock every Fortnite Elements Pass reward?\n\n\nTo unlock every reward in the Fortnite Elements Pass, you'll need 11,000 Chi. That means that throughout the course of the event, you'll need to complete 32 total challenges across the six stages. \n\nThe post How to get Chi and Chakra in Fortnite’s Elements Pass appeared first on Destructoid.",

Second Dinner responded by temporarily disabling the caches, but it thankfully hasn't taken the team long to figure out a solution and fix the bug.\n\n\n\n\nIn an update on the Marvel Snap Discord channel, and handily shared by Marvel Snap News on X (formerly Twitter), Second Dinner has confirmed a fix is already live, and also assured affected players will be fairly compensated. So, any Spotlight Keys you lost to the bug should be refunded to you, letting you spend them again and earn cache rewards as usual.\n\n\nSecond Dinner also plans to gift 500 Gold to any and all players who logged into Marvel Snap while the bug was active. An exact date hasn't been given for when the Gold will be distributed, but it should drop into your inbox within the next week, provided you've been playing the game in the last few days. Although why Second Dinner has confined all this to a Discord post and not shared it anywhere else, not even its own X account, is perplexing.\n\n\nIt's been a bit of a rough week for Marvel Snap. Aside from this admittedly short-lived bug, plenty of players were less than thrilled with the recent patch, which seriously nerfed Zabu, one of the most commonly used cards in the game. I've also noticed Marvel Snap hasn't been running particularly well on iOS since the patch, with several card animations not triggering, but Second Dinner (via another Discord only update shared by Marvel Snap News) has recommended iOS players redownload the game's assets in the settings menu to get things back to normal.\n\nThe post Marvel Snap promises compensation after fixing Spotlight Cache bug appeared first on Destructoid.",

First released in 1998 for Nintendo Power’s download service before getting its own cartridge, this marks the game’s first release in the West.\nAmazing Hebereke is a 1994 fighting game by Sunsoft that pits up to four players battling to knock each other out.

Sporting an eye-popping art direction that blends anime and graffiti art influences, this promising-looking action platformer is coming this year.\nRKGK (pronounced “Rakugaki”) unfolds in a Cap City, a futuristic metropolis caught in a vice grip by the oppressive B Corp led by the villainous Mr. Buff. The plot centers on rebellious graffiti artist Valah, who rages against this machine by using her art to bring life back to the city and inspire its citizens to stand up and rebel.\n\n\nValah gets around by using her graffiti paint to stylishly grind on rails while chaining jumps, dashes, and glides. She also has appears to have her own drone to soar across the cityscape. High-speed platforming is the name of the game, and maintaining a smooth flow state sends her into Defacer mode, transforming the world into a dreamy animated version of itself. Although the trailer doesn’t show off gameplay, it depicts Valah spraying paint to destroy B Corps’ robotic minions. You’ll also be able to create graffiti art using an array of paint and cosmetic tools. Check out the screenshots below for an in-game look at RKGK. \n\nRKGK is Wabisabi Games’ debut title and looks to follow in the graffiti-soaked dystopian future footsteps of games like Jet Set Radio and Marc Ecko’s Getting Up (remember that?).

And it's something you simply have to see, whether you're interested in first-person exploration games or not, because it's a sight to behold. \nAs someone who cannot draw, I'm always fascinated (and impressed) with people who can. That Jong was able to create an entire game using 10,000 drawings is all the more fascinating, and if the trailer below is any indication, it's a game I can't wait to check out. \nWatch the Sketchy Fables gameplay trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nThere's not much more information to find about the game. Its Steam description reads, \"Sketchy Fables is a first-person exploration adventure.\" Diving into the details of the Steam listing, Jong says it plays like an interactive cartoon and features a diverse game environment to explore full of villages and rural landscapes. \nIt's also \"focused on personal exploration with many random encounters and discoveries,\" according to the page. \n\nAs for when Sketchy Fables hits PC, that remains unknown, but it's a game we're keeping our eyes on so hopefully we'll have more to share sooner than later. \nDo you want to check out Sketchy Fables?

In a new teaser trailer published during today's Triple-i Initiative Showcase, we get glimpses of dino-powered armies, action RPG combat mixed with real-time strategy, and more. \n\"We're honored to be showcasing our brand new trailer thanks to the Triple-i Initiative amongst so many incredible games and developers that make up the amazing indie corner of the games industry,\" Northplay CEO Michael Flarup writes in a press release. \"We've poured a lot of love into Dinolords and we can't wait for players to get their hands on it when it launches into Early Access next year.\" \nCheck out the new Dinolords reveal trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nNorthplay says while mixing real-time strategy with action RPG gameplay, players will also have to gather resources, build cities, construct fortifications, and command units in widescale medieval warfare. \nDinolords takes place in an alternate history in which the King of Denmark launches the first dinosaur-powered conflict with his invasion of England, according to a press release. Players take on the role of an English Lord, defending their land against the ferocious invaders and taming their own primeval beasts for battle.\nHere are some Dinolords screenshots for your viewing: \n\nDinolords is set to hit Early Access in 2025. \nAre you going to check out Dinolords next year?

More specifically, we'll finally get a good look at the Shire in the new trailer on April 22. \nAttention, dear Hobbits!

The scuba diving exploration/restaurant simulator has also been enhanced with a few Sony-exclusive perks.\nDave the Diver is also coming to PS4, but a new trailer shows off the PS5 version's DualSense-specific features. That includes using the controller's haptic feedback to \"sense the movements of the deep sea.\" The adaptive triggers add a kick to firing Dave's speargun and a vibrating tension to the harpoon gun. Sound effects, such as phone call ringtones, are emitted through the controller speaker. \n\n\nDave the Diver stars the titular diver as he explores undersea environments to locate and capture various marine species. After fishing, players then use these ingredients to operate a growing sushi restaurant.\nAs editor-in-chief Matt Miller wrote in his 8.75 out of 10 review, \"You might question whether a sushi restaurant management sim crossed with underwater diving is your cup of tea, but that would be missing the point. Dave the Diver is a unique and memorable vacation away from expectations, and it's the very fact that you don't usually play games like this that makes it so satisfying.\"\nDave the Diver is already available on Switch and PC, and has a Godzilla-themed crossover coming in May.",

I am, however, a fan of the Fallout series executive producers Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy. The two worked together on Westworld and though my fandom faded over time, I will always hold up the first season as some of my favorite television ever. I went into Amazon’s Fallout adaptation with unsure expectations. Video game movies and TV shows have improved in recent years, but I will always be hesitant.

Iron Man is an important priority for Motive, and I'm very proud of the work we've accomplished so far.\" \nMotive will work with other EA studios like Criterion, DICE, and Ripple Effect to further expand the company's Battlefield franchise, which saw its last entry, Battlefield 2042, released in 2021. In 2022, we learned the next Battlefield game had entered pre-production with plans to take \"valuable lessons\" learned from Battlefield 2042 into the game's development. \nWhat do you hope to see in the future for the Battlefield franchise?

Ahead of the BAFTA Awards on Thursday, at which Dredge is nominated for four awards, developer Black Salt Games has announced a collaboration with production company Story Kitchen to adapt the critically acclaimed title into a live-action feature film.\nIn the game, players explore a mysterious archipelago as a fishing boat captain. However, the longer you play, the more unsettling the water surrounding the collection of remote islands becomes. The press release pitches the Dredge live-action film, saying, \"Think The Sixth Sense on the water. A grounded atmospheric cosmic horror blend of HP Lovecraft and Ernest Hemingway.\"\n\"We are excited to partner with such an experienced studio team to bring the world we created to live action and ignite the imagination of audiences across the globe,\" a joint statement from the Black Salt Games team said in that same press release.\nStory Kitchen was founded in 2022 by Sonic the Hedgehog 2 producer Dmitri M. Johnson, former APA Agent Mike Goldberg, and their production and development executives Timothy I. Stevenson and Dan Jevons. \"Dredge is a captivatingly eerie and profoundly rich story that had us completely hooked from the very beginning,\" a joint statement from Story Kitchen said in the press release.\nDredge currently has an 80 out of 100 rating on the reviews aggregate website Metacritic.

However, as Variety notes, receiving this tax credit does not guarantee Amazon will accept it and relocate Fallout's production to California for Season 2.\n\n\nFallout premieres on Amazon Prime Video on Thursday, April 11.

Knowing of the Ardognus prophecy, created by the powerful high priest Hahmid III, you must find and destroy the hidden shrine devoted to Ra before the eclipse occurs.\nEmbark on this exciting journey packed with a trusty gun for blasting through doors or dispatching undead mummies; a compass to guide you through a treacherous pyramid; a wristwatch to track the precious time left; and a water bottle to fight dehydration (you’re only human after all). \nCan you solve this ancient mystery within 120 minutes and avert catastrophe, or will Rah's wrath obliterate the moon?\nOur modern reimplementation of the Freescape engine features graphics using hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Total Eclipse support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum, and Amstrad CPC. More releases are coming at a later date. Additionally, there are three playable demos if you want to test the game. Please contact us if you have some other release or demo.\nTo play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build.

          "description": "I was once the hottest new model on the street. Newspapers heralded my arrival in every town. The titans of industry were inspired to produce more goods when I visited their factories. But as the years have passed, so do their eyes pass over me, to eye curiously my replacements. Will you try the new style, ma’am? It’s so much better than that old thing. I’ve watched my friends grow old and die. My brother got caught in traffic and caused a horrific level crossing collision. I get sick more often, wheezing to a halt wherever I am. When I visit the doctor for a spot of renewal, they tell me, “Sorry, I can’t help. You’re too old.” When will I be autoreplaced? Woe is the tale of the Balogh Goods Truck. But what if we could slow or pause the steady march of time? In OpenTTD 14, you can.",
