          "description": "Old, but gold?\nBack in the early 2000’s, the Dark Alliance subseries of the Baldur’s Gate franchise was created as a means of bringing the Baldur’s Gate experience to console players. Either due to hardware limitations or a simple lack of audience interest at the time, the computer RPG design of traditional Baldur’s Gate wouldn’t work for a console game, so Snowblind decided to go with an action RPG for Dark Alliance. It turned out to be the right decision as audiences loved it, so a sequel was soon greenlit to keep the momentum going. Now that it’s gotten a re-release on modern platforms, how does it compare? Well, Baldur’s Gate: Dark Alliance 2 is a better game than its predecessor, yes; unfortunately, time hasn’t been too kind to this release.\nThe plot of Dark Alliance 2 is about as basic as it gets, centering around a villainous vampire who kidnaps the heroes of the first Dark Alliance and terrorizes the region around the city of Baldur’s Gate. You take on the role of a new hero who comes to the city in search of fame and fortune, but your hero eventually gets caught up in the effort to fight back against the vampire and bring peace to the surrounding region.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Say cheese!\nTo anyone familiar with the recent spate of first-person horror titles, MADiSON will seem instantly familiar. With its moody lighting, tight corridors, and affinity for jump scares, there's little here that really sets it apart from the likes of Outlast or Layers of Fear on the surface. Diving into the game a bit deeper, however, unveils some pretty interesting gameplay mechanics, chiefly driven by an item you'll be carrying around for the majority of the experience: a polaroid camera.\nThe camera itself provides multiple functions; some of which are pretty obvious, and others that might not be quite so clear until you start using it properly. Its main use, of course, is to light your way in the darkness. MADiSON is, naturally, a very dark game (although a patch to add in brightness settings proves more than welcome), so there will be multiple instances where you'll struggle to see ahead of you without any clear source of light. This is where your camera comes into play: a quick flash of the shutter will instantly reveal your surroundings, if only for the briefest of moments. It's a clever way of showing you key items that may otherwise be obscured, but it's also an effective way to implement some pretty pant-wettlingly scary jump scares.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

We think it's both, but we also admire the musical skill it takes to think, \"you know what would go well together? Boybands and an old DS game about the legal system.\" It's like the first person to find out that chocolate and crisps is a good combination, even when everyone called them mad.\nBy combining Maya's theme with classic '90s hit, I Want It That Way, and then casting the four boys — Phoenix, Edgeworth, Apollo and Klavier Gavin — as the band, Chessete has created a masterpiece. It's far from their first time doing this very specific kind of mashup, too — check out this Daft Punk one:\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Because we've all been that person who really wants a game that's like another game they really enjoyed, and they want some more recommendations. It's easy to lump games together by genre to answer that query — but what about all the games that fall through the cracks?\nSome games defy genre in interesting ways, but that makes them hard to put in nice boxes (although maybe putting things in nice boxes isn't such a great thing, anyway). Other games mix genres to create something entirely new — like metroidvanias, before \"metroidvania\" was a thing, or the dreaded deckbuilding roguelike — but that means that they don't quite fit in anywhere, either.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Every year, Nintendo has posted a nice, summery render of our plumber boy at the beach, and this year is no different. But when Mario's at the beach, and not at work, he trades in his overalls for swimming trunks — and that means this is the only time that we see him topless.\nIn 2020, Nintendo decided (for whatever reason) to excise poor Mario's nips, presumably out of some Nintendo-esque need to PROTECT THE CHILDREN from the horrors of thinking that Mario is mammalian. The internet, not to be outdone, decided that this was weirder than just letting Mario have nipples in the first place, and so in 2021, Nintendo put them back where they belong.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It’s a carefully authored story that wants to be driven by interaction, and it’s a single-scene play space that wants to create immersion in a whole world. It’s such a tricky line to walk between structured gameplay that’s interactive but dry and a carefully managed story that limits interaction. But with Strange Horticulture, Bad Viking pulls it off. It creates deep immersion in a well-rounded world while starting from a simple place. The filling-out of the world as we played came from our own discoveries, and we were drawn powerfully into the emerging intrigue of the plot.\nIn Strange Horticulture, Bad Viking has created a mystery story set in a bizarro-style English Lake District, where real-life place names nestle amid castles, stone circles and religious cults. The player runs an apothecary dealing in specialist plants with medicinal, mind-altering, magical and even mechanical effects. Each day, a series of customers arrive at your counter in need of horticultural help. By cross-referencing what’s on your plant shelf with what’s in your plant-cyclopaedia, you identify the salves, syrups and embrocations that are needed. There’s a loop of learning and labelling plants to receive more plants and more info pages that immediately sucks you in.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Announced a year ago and \"coming soon\" in 2022 to the Epic Games Store, this extremely unsettling slice of nope - but also yes - just got a new trailer.

          "description": "Ice Code Games may have called it Hard West 2, but 'round these parts we refer to it as \"The Laughing Deer Show\". New to town, are ya? Let me clue you in. Laughing Deer is a six-foot man of raw muscle and rage, a native American warrior with shoulders like a pair of yoked oxen and a personality best described as \"barely contained\". Unlike the rest of his posse, which includes a cowboy without a shadow, a woman with ties to the occult, and one very stubborn corpse, Laughing Deer doesn't really \"do\" guns. While his compatriots are all crouched behind crates, ricocheting bullets off buckets and wheelbarrows to hit enemies from behind, Laughing Deer is getting in their faces (shortly before his club gets significantly further into their faces).\nNow, bringing a club to a gunfight might not seem like the smartest idea. But while pistols require two of a gunslinger's action points to shoot, and rifles take all three, it only takes one action point to whack some neckerchief-wearing bandit with a big ol' stick. And Laughing Deer whacks a whole point of damage harder than normal, meaning he can rush foes and nail them into the ground with a couple of hard swings before they can pull the trigger. Better yet, killing an enemy completely refills a character's action points in Hard West, meaning that, when set up right, Laughing Deer can ping around the battlefield like a weaponised pinball. \nRead more",

Thus, we discuss Lucasarts games like the Monkey Island series. See, I tied it all together.\nIn fact, I'm not sure if I'd wipe Monkey Island from my head or not, because I can't be sure how much of my love for it is fuelled by nostalgia. Matthew has other concerns, though, because as is our usual fashion we spend some time discussing the question \"what games would you play for the first time again?\" more literally than is intended.

Fortunately, that seems to be more than just pastel colours and cynical “For girls” marketing – the G375 headset, G705 mouse, and the G715 and G713 keyboards are all proper gaming-spec accessories, and they’ve been crafted by mostly female design and engineering teams based on feedback from women PC players.\r\n\n\r\nThe G705, then, is a wireless mouse designed for smaller hands, while the G375 headset – also wireless – is proportioned to fit smaller heads and has more space in the earcups to accommodate earrings. It’s safe to say I’m not the Aurora Collection’s target audience, but having used the G705, the G375, and the G715 wireless keyboard as my main peripherals for a few days, I can say all three are pretty swish playthings regardless of how you identify. What’s more, their light, soft-cornered aesthetic is a nice break from the blacks, greys and harsh angles that have become standard design language for gaming gear. Anyone who’s ever cringed their face inside out at a peripheral resembling Megatron’s running shoe may indeed find these more to their tastes.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The story of Wolfenstein 3D’s development makes for a fascinating time capsule of those early days of game development - a milestone in gaming history that underlines just how much the industry has grown over the decades since.\nBut that’s getting ahead of ourselves a bit. The origins of Wolfenstein 3D, a gloriously violent game that paved the way for the even more gloriously violent Doom, can be found in a somewhat more cutesy series of titles: the Commander Keen series. id Software made four of these side-scrolling platformers for MS-DOS in very quick succession between 1990 and 1991, and studio co-founder John Romero tells us that the team was definitely ready for a change.\nRead more",

With nowhere else to go, she’s decided to take the bus back to her hometown of Timber Hills to move back in with her parents (hopefully, temporarily). While she's killing time on the journey, she begins to take a dating personality quiz aptly titled ‘What’s your Thirstsona?’ and it transports her to a colourful dreamlike metaverse where she can skate around and answer deep questions about her love life.

I know which one I prefer, because the story mode is a love letter to Half-Life 2, complete with Bane-muffled jackboot cops, endlessly catching up with a Story Guy who's inexplicably ahead of you again, a bionic arm standing in for the gravity gun, and a spooky dark underground section where you're swarmed by creepy mutants.

This makes it a good time to pick up a SATA drive for desktops or laptops that can't accommodate another M.2 drive, especially for media or game storage where the speed difference between SATA and NVMe is minimal. \nToday, Teamgroup's imaginatively-named T-Force Vulcan Z drive is down to $128 for a 2TB model, the lowest price we can find for this size at present. \nNote that to get this price, you do need to be an Amazon Prime member - normal folk you like and me will see a price of $160 instead, alongside a reminder to 'join Prime to save $32 on this item'. You should be able to join Prime under a free trial, order the item and then cancel your Prime status to avoid a charge. \nRead more",

          "description": "I’ve been excited to play Exoprimal, Capcom’s upcoming multiplayer dino shooter, ever since it used the phrase “unstoppable raptor horde” in one of its trailers. It is a completely unhinged combination of words that makes me giddy just thinking about them. I’ll often find myself muttering them out loud when I’m unloading the dishwasher or folding laundry. “Unstoppable raptor horde”. It’s like the season finale of language. It’s perfect.\r\n\n\r\nAdmittedly, prior to the existence of that phrase, I was feeling a little sceptical about Exoprimal’s existence. Not only does Capcom have - let’s say - a less than favourable track record when it comes to multiplayer titles, but as a long-term fan of Dino Crisis I was a bit miffed to see them creating a game featuring prehistoric creatures that wasn’t some kind of lavish remake of my beloved PS1 series.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Resharpen your blade...\nSNK's 2019 release Samurai Shodown is a sharp-ass game — in both literal and metaphorical ways. The cult fighter successfully managed to reinvent itself for modern platforms, while retaining the very deliberate, intense, and high-damage combat style of the Neo Geo classics. Packed with interesting characters and powered by an easy-to-learn, difficult-to-master play style, Samurai Shodown is a unique fighter that deserves to sit within the current zeitgeist.\nAnd it looks like the cult title is getting the opportunity to take a second swing for the gold, as developer SNK has announced that it has teamed with studio Code Mystics for a new update that will implement brand new rollback netcode for the PlayStation, Xbox and PC editions of the period piece scrapper. While SamSho is a fine title from an aesthetic and gameplay standpoint, unfortunately, the online element leaves a lot to be desired. While, in 2022, you can still find people fighting the good fight, lag-free action is harder to come by — which is a no go in such a precise, high-damage fighter.\n\nAnd so, for the dedicated Samurai Shodown community — and fighting game fans in general — the rollback netcode update will be a very welcome addition, along with a sign that SNK has not abandoned the title in favor of some of its more modern releases. In fact, it is believed that the new update should bring online fluidity in alignment with The King of Fighters XV, which has very solid online stability once its fights are underway.\nNo specific release date was announced for the new update outside of the general window of spring 2023. Samurai Shodown is available now on PS4, Xbox, PC, Nintendo Switch, and Stadia. Once again, the netcode update is only coming to PlayStation, PC, and Xbox editions of the game.\nEvo 2023 is currently underway. You can check out the full schedule right here.\nThe post Rollback netcode coming to Samurai Shodown spring 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Absolutely Not-So-Sweet Marie\nIf you've been on pins and needles waiting to find out who would be the final character of the Skullgirls Season 1 Pass, you can unclinch and rejoice. During the opening night of Evo 2022, a teaser trailer dropped revealing that Marie will become a playable character. Launching in 2023 for both Skullgirls 2nd Encore and Skullgirls Mobile, Marie's arrival on the character select screen comes more than 10 years after Skullgirls first launched on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade. She follows Annie of the Stars, Umbrella, and Black Dahlia in joining the cast, the latter of whom is still in alpha.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCcAlwQb8Vo&t=3s\nThere is not a whole lot to take from that teaser, but I'm sure the news is more than enough for those Skullgirls fans who have stuck with the game over the last 10 years. As a casual fighter fan, I have to commend Future Club, Autumn Games, and Hidden Variable for keeping this game and its community going as long as it has. Other developers would have already thrown in the towel and moved on to a sequel.\nAs for the Skullgirls tournament at Evo 2022, congratulations to SonicFox for bringing home the victory in the Grand Finals against Dekillsage.\nSkullgirls 2nd Encore is now available for PC, PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch. It is scheduled to launch for Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S later in 2022. The Season 1 Pass is now available for PC and PlayStation 4. It is expected to release on Nintendo Switch before the end of the year.\nThe post Marie will be playable in Skullgirls 2nd Encore starting next year appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Valve is test-running support for the Joy-Cons\nA pair of Nintendo controllers could be joining the list of Steam-supported input devices. In a new Steam client beta, Valve has added support for Nintendo Switch Joy-Cons.\nThe dual-unit controllers are, of course, primarily for the Nintendo Switch. But just in case you've been wanting to use them on your PC, some additional support is currently in the Steam beta.\nValve's support allows for the Joy-Cons to be used individually, as mini-gamepads. Or they can be combined into a paired, singular controller. Essentially, the same controller configurations you might mess around with on your Switch.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WniaKJzCNRI\nIf other Nintendo controllers are more your speed, the Steam client beta also has improved support for Nintendo Online classic controllers. That includes the Nintendo 64, NES, SNES, and Genesis controllers. Support for those classics rolled out last week, but it looks like Valve is improving on the support that's already available.\nJoyous controller options\nIt might seem a bit strange of an update, at first. I mean, I have tried to connect Joy-Cons to a PC before, with extremely mixed results. But official support isn't just nice for those who don't want to pick up extra controllers.\nJoy-Cons are a pretty unique style of controller, with built-in sensors and everything. I'd only be speculating, but I'm interested to see what modders and other controller tinkerers can do with this.\nAnd more controller support is never a bad thing. I'm almost tempted to try connecting these to a Steam Deck, if only to enable the bizarre dream of using Switch Joy-Cons on a portable PC.\nWhether you're just looking for some extra Rocket League controllers or concocting bizarre scenarios, it seems neat. If you want to try it out, you can simply opt into the Steam client beta and test out Joy-Con support for yourself.\nThe post A Steam client beta update adds Nintendo Switch Joy-Con support appeared first on Destructoid.",

That uh, isn't the case anymore, but these concepts from Blizzard senior artist Juyoung Oh really showcase how creative the team could get.\nFound on Reddit, these skins are actually a few years old, and were done during a \"HOTS Hackathon\" (sprint) in 2018, with Oh revealing them two years ago. Oh calls them a \"personal project,\" but I can easily see these becoming skins in the game's heyday.\nThe skins are DJ Kid Murky, Pop star Li-Ming, and Selfiegenic Stitches. All of them have concept art of various parts of their kit too, and a few are genius. Murky's egg (where he hibernates if he dies in battle, only to get resurrected quicker than most MOBA characters) has a router and a cell phone charger on it. Li-Ming is centered around a technological-disco theme, and Stitches even puts a party on for people he eats.\nAzmodunk was perhaps the best example of how out-there the Heroes of the Storm skin teams could get. They even recorded real basketball noises just for the skin! 2016 Blizzard: it feels like a different timeline.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKa4A-oas74\n[gallery link=\"file\" ids=\"338293,338294,338295\"]\nThe post These Heroes of the Storm skin concepts make me wish it wasn’t in maintenance mode appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Tencent reportedly opening wallet for majority shares\nTencent is reportedly interested in becoming a majority stakeholder for developer/publisher Ubisoft. According to a new report from news outlet Reuters, the holding company, already a minority stakeholder, is considering making a significant investment in the Assassin's Creed/Far Cry developer in the near future.\nCiting multiple sources \"with direct knowledge of the matter,\" Reuters claims that Tencent has expressed a desire to become the key shareholder for Ubisoft, and is allegedly willing to pay an astounding premium of over $100 USD per share in order to make it happen — more than twice the share's current value. Reuters report, unsurprisingly, caused a rise in Ubisoft stock Wednesday, with a 15% rise in value increasing Ubisoft share prices from $43.03 to around $48.33 .\nThere have been many whispers of a possible Ubisoft sale for some time now, with rumors that the Guillemot family — some of whom are the company's initial founders — might have been looking to purchase the company outright themselves. Should Tencent choose to put its money where its mouth is, however, it seems very unlikely that anyone would be able or willing to match its proposal of an approximate 130% share price. And perhaps the holding company is willing to offer such a premium for that very reason.\nTencent, of course, already has minority and majority stakes in numerous major players within the gaming industry. As well as owning several internal development studios, Tencent holds varying stakes in companies such as Activision, Supercell, Epic Games, Remedy, Riot Games, PlatinumGames, Bohemia Interactive, Dontnod Entertainment, Klei Entertainment, Inflexion, and Funcom.\nThe post Rumor: Tencent looking to become majority stakeholder in Ubisoft appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Announced at BitSummit\nInti Creates is at it again, continuing to corner the 2D market with the new action platformer Grim Guardians: Demon Purge. The game is actually being shown this weekend at BitSummit in Kyoto, Japan, on August 6 and 7.\nGrim Guardians will feature two playable characters (who are sisters) in the form of demon hunters trying to rescue their school from peril: Shinobu Kamizono (ranged attacker) and Maya Kamizono (melee). Inti Creates says \"swapping characters is key to gameplay,\" and in addition to solo play, there's also a two-player co-op mode. As our own CJ Andriessen points out, those two names are from Gal Gun: Double Peace.\nAmazingly, Inti Creates is calling this \"the beginning of a brand new series of 2D action games,\" hence the obvious subtitle. Whereas Azure Striker Gunvolt is their own take on the Mega Man franchise, so too will Grim Guardians mirror aspects of Castlevania (like their Bloodstained tie-in projects). Hey, if Konami isn't going to do it, someone else should!\nGrim Guardians: Demon Purge release date and platform info\nAs for a release date and platforms, the former is listed as \"TBD,\" but the latter includes PC, PS4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. The official website will likely be the first place we'll get that info.\nJust as I said in my recent Azure Striker Gunvolt 3 review, I'm game for basically anything Inti Creates that even looks remotely like Grim Guardians.

          "description": "A new GDK update could see some graphical improvements for the Series S\nA recent update to Microsoft's Game Development Kit is adding a little extra bump in memory for the Xbox Series S. Memory allocation in a GDK update will potentially allow graphical improvements for Xbox Series S games.\nIn the June GDK, an unlisted video as spotted by The Verge popped up today, detailing improvements to the developer toolkit. One part  notes that more memory is now available for games.\n\"Hundreds of megabytes\" have been freed up, according to the video. This should give developers more control over memory, and could improve graphical performance in memory-constrained situations.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb6ZLGwkClM\nAs Ars Technica details, this hasn't been publicly detailed yet. But this could see developers get a little extra memory to work with on the Xbox Series S side of Microsoft's current-gen hardware.\nMore memory for the box\nThis seems like good news for Xbox Series S fans who want a little graphical \"oomph\" on their games. The Xbox Series S is the cheaper of Microsoft's two current-gen offerings, and has proven to be popular.\nThe relatively cheaper and smaller machine has been a nice surprise for players. It's especially nice for those who aren't necessarily chasing 4K resolution graphics. But as Digital Foundry notes in its Xbox Series S write-up, differences can appear game-to-game.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94O6o6yOGgA\nHopefully, freeing up this extra memory will help out the Series S versions and deal with some troubles around optimizing for the system. While hundreds of megabytes isn't a sudden multi-GB swing in horsepower, it could be a little uptick that could do a lot.\nThe GDK update also notes other changes as well, like addressing an issue with graphics virtual addresses. We'll see how this GDK update ultimately pans out for Xbox Series S users in the games to come.\nThe post Xbox dev tools update gives developers more memory for Series S appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Saturnalia is an upcoming indie survival horror with one of the most interesting visual styles I’ve seen in the genre in a minute. \nDeveloped by Italy-based studio Santa Ragione, Saturnalia is influenced heavily by the folklore of Sardinia, Italy, and inspired by Italian Giallo horror films (typically more horror-esque mystery thrillers). In it, you control four different characters, all connected through a mysterious storyline that ties back to the “haunting traditions” of an ancient village. \n“The village itself is an elaborate maze with no two iterations being precisely the same – you will have to explore and solve mysteries of the game largely unguided,” the game’s website reads. “Die, and watch the village reconfigure itself into a new form. Solve puzzles and open shortcuts to new areas with tools and items you find along the way, unlocking every piece of the story with different characters, each suited for another aspect of exploration and investigation.” \nAll of that sounds great, but Saturnalia's unique art style makes me most excited. It’s like a mix of stop-motion and sketchbook, which looks like it’ll lend itself nicely to the game's horror elements. Check it out for yourself below:\n\n\nSanta Ragione is the studio behind games like Fotonica, MirrorMoon EP, and Wheels of Aurelia. Saturnalia does not yet a launch date, but it will hit PC exclusively via the Epic Games Store sometime in 2022. The studio is planning to launch the game on other platforms, but the timing on that remains TBA. \nWhat do you think of Saturnalia? Let us know in the comments below!",

          "description": "When Sonic Origins arrived on consoles and PC in June, it delivered a four-pack of classic Sonic the Hedgehog games from the '90s. While the bundle was praised for bringing Sonic 1, Sonic 2, Sonic 3 & Knuckles, and Sonic CD to modern platforms with various gameplay enhancements and other additions, it was also heavily criticized. Various bugs, mislabeled titles in the in-game museum, and overall stability (particularly with the PC version) frustrated the player base as they waited for Sega to fix the problems. This week, Sega released that long-awaited patch, addressing those problems and more, hopefully stabilizing the compilation and making the overall experience more enjoyable.\nThe two biggest items this patch addresses include fixing issues with the game crashing and one of the most annoying bugs of the year: Tails falling behind in Sonic 2 and constantly jumping instead of respawning on the player – we can finally turn off mute when playing Sonic 2. The patch also includes fixes for sound bugs, menu and controller issues, museum mislabels, and data-saving issues. Unfortunately, the replacement music in Ice Cap, Carnival Night, and Launch Base remain in place. \nThe patch is available to download now for all platforms. Sonic Origins arrived on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on June 23. For more on the speedy selection of games, check out our review here.",

My ringtone is the FFVII victory fanfare theme. But the biggest hole in my fandom for years has been Final Fantasy XIV.\nMMOs have never appealed to me, but as I listened to friends and colleagues rave about FFXIV over its long existence, the more I felt like I was missing out on something special. Every expansion and free trial had me hovering over the purchase button, but I always told myself I didn’t have the time to invest in such a behemoth of a game. The excuses have come to an end. \nI’ve finally broken the seal and dived headfirst into one of the most celebrated games on the planet. Join me on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central as I trek through my first dungeon with the help of two of the biggest FFXIV experts I know. First up is the returning Jon Woodey, Game Informer web programmer extraordinaire. I’ll also have a special guest: MinnMax cohort Sarah Podzorski joins our party to lend her bubbly brand of insight. Watch along to learn some valuable tips and tricks and, if you’re like me, get an early taste of FFXIV to see if it’s something you want to jump into as well!\nWatch on Twitch!\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

          "description": "Much in the same way Nintendo recently released its financial results for the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2023, which ends March 2023, Capcom has done the same. As a result, we now have an updated list of the best-selling Capcom games as of June 30, 2022, which is when the company’s latest financial quarter ended, as reported by MyNintendoNews. \nIf you’re a Capcom fan, there’s likely no surprise as to which games are at the top, but there might be a few surprises for you in it elsewhere.\nHere are the top 10 best-selling Capcom games: \nMonster Hunter World: 18.3 million \nResident Evil 7: Biohazard: 11 million\nMonster Hunter Rise: 10.3 million\nResident Evil 2: 9.8 million\nMonster Hunter World: Iceborn: 9.5 million \nResident Evil 5: 8.3 million\nResident Evil 6: 8.3 million\nStreet Fighter V: 6.6 million\nResident Evil Village: 6.4 million\nStreet Fighter II: 6.3 million\nAs you can see, this list is mostly Monster Hunter and Resident Evil, as anyone tuned into Capcom’s releases probably could have guessed. However, it's important to note that Capcom, strangely, breaks each individual release up as its own game, meaning each of the multiple Resident Evil 4 re-releases counts as its own game. Collectively, though, Resident Evil 4 would be on this top 10 list. The same can be said for various other titles, such as Dragon's Dogma and its re-release, and more. \nNow that you’ve seen this top 10 list, go check out the top 10 best-selling games on Switch and then read Game Informer’s review of Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak, the recent expansion for the game. After that, read about Capcom’s remake of Resident Evil 4, which is due out next March. \n[Source: MyNintendoNews]\nAre you surprised by this list? Let us know in the comments below!",

          "description": "PlayStation revealed that the long-rumored remake of The Last of Us was real in a leak hours before Naughty Dog could officially reveal it during Geoff Keighley’s Summer Game Fest, but alas, it’s real nonetheless.\nFollowing in the steps of its sequel, The Last of Us Part II, the remake is called The Last of Us Part 1, and it’s beautiful. It will also cost $70, and some fans have criticized Naughty Dog and PlayStation for that price, citing that $70 is a high price tag for a game released on the PlayStation 3 before getting remastered for the PlayStation 4 a year later. It also appears to be very much the same game – just with improved graphics and some changes to AI systems and other under-the-hood things. Nonetheless, it’s out on Sept. 1 and will cost $70. \nSince the reveal, Naughty Dog has been slowly dolling out information about the upcoming title, including neat comparison videos that showcase how drastic the visual upgrades are. The studio released a new one this morning, this time comparing a sequence with Ellie and Joel riding horses on a road. Check it out for yourself below: \nGet ready to hit the dusty trail for a beautiful -- and dangerous -- journey across America in The Last of Us Part I!\nhttps://t.co/kbnwKv1n5m pic.twitter.com/NoVvqUzSTp\nAugust 4, 2022\nAs you can see, the difference is night and day, with the remake looking a lot more like Part II.

A total of 40 bosses await, and players gain character data by defeating them with the added goal of filling a personal database. \n\n\nDespite launching stateside, this is a largely direct port of the Japanese version, and the game’s original link cable trading function has been disabled.

Square Enix revealed this heavily rumored (and leaked) remaster today with the first official trailer, and you can check it out for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Tactics Ogre: Reborn now features voice acting, improved visuals, and more. Square Enix says, “Tactics Ogre: Reborn features updated game design, fully-voiced cutscenes, improved graphics, and sound.” Tactics Ogre: Reborn will be available as a physical and digital Standard Edition on PS5, PS4, and Switch and a digital-only Standard Edition on PC. A digital Premium Edition will be available for all platforms the game is coming to later this year. \nThe digital Standard Edition includes a selection of three songs from the remaster’s soundtrack as a preorder bonus. The digital Premium Edition contains the entire soundtrack as a preorder bonus and a “Tactics Ogre (1995) Digital Mini Soundtrack.” \nWhile waiting for Tactics Ogre: Reborn to hit PlayStation, Switch consoles, and PC this November, read our thoughts on the original in the Game Informer Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together review.

From Adventure Time to Game of Thrones, Player First Games' debut title is a wacky fusion of legendary franchises that's left fans enamored with the light-hearted art style and Super Smash-inspired gameplay. Sadly, the rising champ's first season and next playable character, Morty (Rick & Morty), have been pushed back. A finalized release date remains unknown.  \nWe want to let everyone know that we are delaying the start of Season 1 & the release of Morty to a later date. We know this might be disappointing for some and want to assure our Community that we are dedicated to delivering new and exciting content that delights players. (2/3)\nAugust 4, 2022\nTweets released by the MultiVersus dev team thank players for their continued support and patience while announcing the unexpected news (seen above). You can read the complete statement below:\nSeason 1 was initially slated to launch on August 9. For now, you'll just have to keep busy kicking Lebron James' butt. John Carson previewed MultiVersus for us and concluded his findings by stating, \"I went into the alpha test of MultiVersus with low expectations. Besides Smash Bros., the big brand mash-up fighters feel hollow and feature underwhelming rosters, but I've come away impressed with what I've played so far. The cast is great so far, and each character brings unique gameplay and mechanics to the fray.\"\nWhat are your thoughts on MultiVersus so far? Let us know in the comments below!",

Like a lot of sci-fi, the show leverages futuristic technology and far-fetched ideas to get its point across. But at its core, it’s still a show about the psychology of people playing a game and how that game is really just about life and the decisions we make that shape that life. Westworld may not borrow from a longstanding video game license. Still, with its incisive and often surprising perspectives, it has emerged as the best show about video games, their potential, and their threat that I’ve ever seen.\nSPOILERS follow for the entirety of the Westworld TV series, up to and including current episodes of Season 4.\nAnyone who has played…",

If you weren't able to attend those events (or the virtual event earlier this year), you've missed out on your opportunity to catch them to this point. However, that changes later this month, as the four Ultra Beasts are set to gather during the Pokémon Go Fest 2022: Finale event.\nThe finale is a global event that trainers can enjoy regardless of location. In addition to the Ultra Beasts, participating trainers will encounter other Pokémon they may not usually see in the wild, as well as the Mythical Pokémon Shaymin, who can be obtained by completing special research missions. This also features the conclusion of the story of Professor Willow being sucked into an Ultra Wormhole. The Ultra Beasts available in Pokémon Go through this event include Pheromosa, Nihilego, Buzzwole, and Xurkitree.\nFinally, Daily Adventure Incenses have been added to the game. These special incenses can be used once a day and last for 15 minutes. This special daily item can attract Pokémon not typically found in your area and can even pull in Legendary Pokémon. \nSince the game's launch in 2016, Pokémon Go has expanded well beyond the original 151 creatures. As of this writing, you can now catch, train, and battle more than 700 Pokémon throughout your travels. The Pokémon Go Fest 2022: Finale is set to happen on Saturday, August 27, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. local time.",

Amazon Luna joins an ever-growing list of cloud-gaming services that already include the likes of Google Stadia, Xbox Cloud Gaming, Nvidia GeForce Now, and more in the Samsung Gaming Hub.\nThe hub, which was added to all 2022 models in late June, collects your various catalogs of cloud entitlements on one screen with no additional hardware required. That means if you own one game's entitlement on Google Stadia but another's rights on Amazon Luna, you can access them through the same hub without the need for any consoles. Not only that, but you can play these games using any supported Bluetooth controller.\nAmazon Luna offers various subscription plans, with the top-tier subscription, Luna+, offering access to triple-A titles from publishers like Sega and Capcom as well as various independent titles. If you're an Amazon Prime subscriber, you can access a rotating collection of titles. This month's offerings include Control: Ultimate Edition, Myst, Steel Assault, and Garfield Kart. You can also add Ubisoft+ to your subscription for an additional cost to play games in franchises like Assassin's Creed, Watch Dogs, Ghost Recon, and Far Cry. \nThrough the addition of Amazon Luna to the library of cloud-gaming services, Samsung Gaming Hub now offers more than 1,000 games to choose from. I came away impressed from my time with the company's new gaming initiative at Summer Game Fest this year.

While it has shown some flash on the court and tantalized with RPG systems in MyCareer, it has a long way to go to reach the championship form we celebrated years ago. Last year's game was a step in the right direction that laid the foundation for a promising future with a more dynamic defensive game, better perimeter play for smaller players, and great depth found in The City and MyTeam. It'll be interesting to see if Visual Concepts can build off of these gains in NBA 2K23 and continue to innovate on the court, and find ways to better integrate the WNBA into its modes. As always, making VC less intrusive is a necessity.\nWe still don't have insight into any of this year's modes – other than the Jordan Challenge returning with 15 flashback moments from Michael Jordan's career – but we do know what to expect from gameplay. Visual Concepts uses the word \"authenticity\" to sum up this year's changes, which appear to apply a high level of realism to little interactions between players and how the ball is handled. Here are the key additions and changes you can expect to see on the court when NBA 2K23 launches on September 9:\nEasier Play\nMore Pro for the Pro Stick\nHang on the Rim\nShooting is a Weapon\nKilling Stalls with Adrenaline \nDefensive Play\nImproved A.I.\nBadges Sound More Confusing But Better?\nPurchase",

          "description": "Herschel \"Guy\" Beahm IV, known by most as Dr. Disrespect, helped form a \"AAA game studio\" with former Call of Duty and Halo developers in December of last year. Dubbed Midnight Society, the studio's first project was slated to be a multiplayer shooter. More details about it have been released, including word that it's a PvPvE extraction shooter. \nNow, Midnight Society's first game has a name – Deadrop – and gameplay footage. This gameplay comes from players who had (very) early access to the title, so it's less of a demo or vertical slice of gameplay and more of a proof of concept. Check it out for yourself in the tweets below from Okami Games. \nHere's another gameplay clip in a different firing range. #DEADROP pic.twitter.com/odT5QHYtFp\nJuly 30, 2022\nOne more clip showing the outdoor areas and world design.\n@oOStep_Oo for the clips, go give him a follow!#DEADROP pic.twitter.com/5XGN5uPSxx\nJuly 30, 2022\nAs you can see, the gameplay as it stands today consists of a firing range with a single weapon. You can catch glimpses of the world design, too, and it looks somewhat cyberpunk-y. Only time will tell what the final product will look like, as all signs point to this game being years away from release. \nThe reception to the gameplay has been less than great, to say the least. It doesn't help that Beahm tweeted, \"I can take a screenshot right now...blows out anything from the [Call of Duty] engine\" back in June because this game does not appear to stack up against Call of Duty's visuals. Perhaps it will one day, but that remains to be seen. \nWhat do you think of Deadrop's gameplay? Let us know in the comments below!",

However, getting an Xbox Series X or a PlayStation 5 around the time Cyberpunk 2077 was released in 2020 was challenging, and many had to play CDPR's latest RPG on last-gen consoles. You probably already know the story of how that went – it was not a good game to play on last-gen consoles at all.

          "description": "The PlayStation 5 has been the current Sony console for just under two years, having been released on November 12, 2020, in the U.S. At launch, there were a number of new features associated with the console such as Game Help cards, Activity Cards, and several others. \nOne of those new features was the Accolades system. If you’re like me, you didn’t know this feature existed before it made its way into headlines today. As for why it’s in headlines, it’s because the launch feature is being discontinued in “the fall of 2022,” according to Sony. \n“In fall of 2022, the Accolades feature on PlayStation 5 will no longer be supported,” an update from Sony reads. “The feature hasn’t seen the level of usage we anticipated, so we are refocusing our efforts. We encourage the community to continue to send positive messages to one another.” \nIf you’re curious about what Accolades was in light of its forthcoming discontinuation, it allowed players to give accolades and positive encouragement to other players they came across online. You could give another player a Helpful, Welcoming, or Good Sport accolade based on what it was like playing with them. You were allowed to give one accolade per match and you could only give them to players who weren’t your friends. As for why, well, Sony kept track of your accolades and other players could view them. \nYou’ve now only got a few months (maybe even less) to secure as many of these accolades as possible or you could just ignore the feature, which is probably what you’ve been doing the past two years (whether you knew it or not).\nIn the meantime, read our thoughts on the latest PlayStation exclusive game in Game Informer’s Stray review. \nHave you ever used the PS5 Accolades feature?

Last year, while I didn't pick my components, I built a machine using NZXT's streaming PC package, which comes with all the parts you need and a handy guide to walk you through the steps. The build took us about three hours, with only a few hiccups along the way.\nIf you don't want to dedicate time to the build and would rather have someone else put it together, there are plenty of pre-built PC options on the market. One of the newest companies exploring this space is Build Redux, a sister company of Digital Storm, the longtime boutique PC manufacturer.\nWhen you go to Build Redux's website, you see the option to build your PC, but not in the way you would expect.

For years, this series has been lauded as a graphical powerhouse, and this teaser sizzles in this way.\nWe'll have to see how the footage shown breaks down as far as new gameplay features, but it would appear perimeter play is getting some of the spotlight this year. The realism in the superstars is also on display, both on the court and in how they celebrate and interact with fans.\nNBA 2K23 will have three different looks on retail stands with NBA Legend Michael Jordan on one cover, Phoenix's Devin Booker on another, and the WNBA's Sue Bird and Diana Taurasi on the third. Michael Jordan's return unfolds through 15 different Jordan Challenge scenarios that recreate key moments from his career.\nMore details should be coming soon, as 2K Sports aims to ship NBA 2K23 on September 9 for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.",

          "description": "\"A new chapter is about to begin amidst a tangled web of factions.\" This line accompanies the latest teaser trailer for Genshin Impact, the incredible free-to-play RPG from miHoYo. The trailer dives into the game's fourth region, Sumeru, which is home to people who can't dream and worship the God of Wisdom.\nSuermu looks lush in foliage, with mushroom creatures scurrying about the trunks of sizable trees. It also contains a desert area and looks to be just as sizable as the game's other areas.\nThe trailer also introduces a host of companion characters that players will meet as quests are completed. The first new character is Tighnari, a forest watcher who we see holding a magical firefly. In Port Ormos, players will run into Alhaitham from the Haravatat in the Akademiya. Further into the game, players meet Dehya of the Desertfolk, who is also a mercenary for the Emerites. There are also Nilou, a character who is pursuing art and dance, Nahida, a mysterious being, and Cyno, the General Mahamatra.\nAll of this content is a part of Genshin Impact's 03 update, which doesn't have a release date yet, but appears to be close, given how much miHoYo has revealed. Genshin Impact is currently available on PlayStation consoles and PC, and works just as well on Android, and iOS.\nAre you still invested in Genshin Impact? If so, what do you hope to see from the new update?",

Players control an investigative reporter guided by a mysterious voice over the radio to explore abandoned Japanese facilities nestled within an island forest teeming with prehistoric wildlife. These dinos are highly intelligent and realistically behave like animals, featuring what Great Ape describes as self-preservation and reactive systemic AI behaviors. \n\n\nPlayers can use stealth to avoid detection while exploring, create distractions, or repel dinos using items like flares and makeshift, non-lethal weaponry. You’ll spend much of the game scrounging for materials as you traverse ruins for clues about the island’s history and how you ended up in this dire situation. \nAccording to the game’s FAQ, The Lost Wild won’t be arriving until late 2024 or early 2025. It has been confirmed for PC via Steam but will also come to unspecified consoles.",
