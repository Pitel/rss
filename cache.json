In fact, it's overall pretty good, but too much of Bannerlord's design is exactly the same as it was in Warband, and the bulk of what's been added is extraneous strategy guff that doesn't meaningfully improve it at all.\nIn between leading your warband around its 2D map and stabbing dudes alongside your men in 3D battles, you can now make weapons by commandeering local workshops (I guess?) to break down and recombine spare swords. You can only do a few per day, so the pattern is to repeatedly click \"make charcoal\", then leave to rest your tired little arms and repeat. I could probably get a more ~optimal build~ by smithing a megasword, but the one I have already does what I need. You can’t equip your army, even though that was in the very ropey Freeman. The end result is another axe in a game where you'll discard hundreds of them. You can't do armour, a huge waste considering the variety available, and that you spend vastly more time seeing your outfits than looking at anyone's pommel.\nRead more",

There, you can find the 5800X for £235 when you use code AFF15 with some nifty extras: a 64GB Micro SD card and a code for Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves. \nThe way it works is pretty simple - you need to get your total basket over £250 for the AFF15 code to work. So, pick anything on the store that's more than £5.51, like this Micro SD card, add it to your basket alongside the 5800X, then use the AFF15 code to bring the price down to the £235 we quoted. The game code will come with your order, no opt-in necessary, from what we understand. \nRead more",

The trick involves trading gold farmed in WOW for tokens that convert to Battle.net balance, which can then be spent on Overwatch 2 cosmetics. It’s a cunning ploy that speaks volumes about player frustration with the multiplayer shooter’s new free to play mechanics, a situation that might still change if Blizzard listen to results of a recent survey.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Too late now! Plus, witches are totally Halloween fodder - and they're one of my key trends for games at the moment. Video games are lousy with both current and upcoming witches these days.\nIt makes sense. They've already got brilliant marketing. Few Halloween-y sights are more iconic than a pointy hat, a black cat, and a sihouetted figure flying in front of the moon on a broomstick. The witches I've collected here are definitely going to get you in the pumpkin spirit, even if they manage to run through most other genres except horror... Look, Halloween is mostly about sweets and dressing up these days anyway (and by the way, I am livid that I've not got any parties to go to this year, because my hair is exactly the right length to do a perfect Carmy Berzatto costume).\nRead more",

Its four main characters, Diya, Min-seo, Noelle, and Akarsha, use the liquefaction of a caterpillar inside a cocoon as a metaphor for the awkward teenage growing phase they’re all in. In the sequel, set a few months later, they find a butterfly with a crumpled wing. It’s a victim of a false spring, having emerged from its cocoon too early due to unseasonably warm weather. One of them worries that they are like the injured insect; forever marked by their early life. And it’s this that Butterfly Soup 2 digs into much more deeply than its predecessor.\nIf you’re not familiar with the original, Butterfly Soup is a visual novel about four Asian girls navigating high school in the late 2000s, playing baseball, and falling in love. On replaying it to get ready for this review, it made me cry at least twice and laugh out loud a bunch more. It’s pay what you want with no minimum price, and takes about 2-3 hours. I’m also going to spoil parts of it, so go play it already.\nRead more",

          "description": "Stress Level Zero's Boneworks was Half-life: Alyx before Half-Life: Alyx released. Released in December 2019, its combination of deeply tactile interactions with a campaign heavily inspired by Half-Life 2 represented a major step forward for VR experiences at the time. It had a fair few rough edges, and you needed a cast-iron stomach to play it, but for about four months it was the ambitious, all-encompassing VR experience that the medium had hitherto lacked.\nThen Half-Life: Alyx came around, raising the (crow)bar so high that you'd need to be Mr Fantastic or some sort of bird with hands to reach it. Which is partly why Bonelab, the newly released sequel to Boneworks, hasn't quite gelled with me in the way its older sibling did. Technologically, its still very impressive, and noodling around with its massive interactive potential remains undeniably fun. But it often feels like a lot of good ideas with too little connective tissue between them. It's also even less compromising on your physiology than Boneworks was, seemingly determined to make existing in VR as uncomfortable as possible.\nRead more",

My first thought as I crouched behind a nearby rock and surveyed its chromium splendour was: \"I am definitely not yet ready to fight this thing.\"\nMy second thought came quickly after the first, when my cover was blown by a nearby Watcher that immediately reared back and emitted a shrill noise that alerted the Thunderjaw to my presence. \"Oh shite.

It is a complicated, huge, and ponderous alien invasion simulator that constantly threatens to drop the other boot on you the entire time. Anything you do could be the butterfly whose little wingflaps eventually result in the obliteration of the planet. It is not a game to be powered through, but to be played and contemplated exclusively for a solid month.\nThat is its central weakness. But I think it had to be this way. Its commitment to an idea is demanding, but if you can tolerate some issues with clarity and presentation, the payoff for meeting it is utterly unique.\nRead more",

Any time in the past couple of weeks that my friends and colleagues thought they were talking to me, they were in fact talking to an exquisite Italian neon-folk horror game wearing my skin and looking out of the eye-holes in my skull. On at least one occasion I lay in bed at 3am, sweaty and frozen in half-asleep fear, because I thought I'd heard a strange rattling noise...\nIn fact it was not stillness, but the panic-sprint into darkness that became my main and oft-unsuccessful tactic whenever I heard the creature of Gravoi. Gravoi itself is a small but inconveniently maze-like fictional Sardinian town, host to a yearly folk festival that, every so often, involves the unwary being carried off and killed by a... something. Unfortunately, four very unwary outsiders - rendered outsiders for a variety of reasons, whether they're locals or not - find themselves having to survive the night of this festival, armed with things like matches, firecrackers and a polaroid camera.\nRead more",

He does have a fairly good reason for it, though. On The Late Show with Stephen Colbert Martin said, “I have not played it because people seem to want this Winds Of Winter book,” the (very) long-awaited sixth chapter in the Game Of Thrones series.\r\n\n \nRead more",

When you use code HUKDAW3821DW, this monitor drops from £1299 to £899, an incredible value for a monitor of this spec. \nLet's quickly run through those specs. This 38-in monitor has a resolution of 3840x1600, essentially a shorter version of 4K, with a 144Hz refresh rate. The monitor is Nvidia G-Sync Ultimate certified, meaning it has a physical G-Sync module to prevent judder and tearing, and it also gets bright enough to earn the lofty DisplayHDR 600 rating. All in all, it's a ton of monitor for a fairly reasonable price. \nRead more",

Now that Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (the second one) is out in full, not just its campaign, I’ve revisited my best settings guide to see whether it can provide a preset-beating balance of looks and performance in the multiplayer component as well. And it does! If anything the various online modes tend to run more smoothly and consistently than the singleplayer story, but whichever you prefer playing, you can make just a few key changes to visibly improve your frames per second. And a COD with more frames just feels better.\nDespite this universal truth, MW2 can be a toughie on older PC hardware: even graphics cards listed among the recommended system requestions need quality cuts to get a stable 60fps at 1080p. In this guide I’ll be showing you how various GPUs perform and where, precisely, the make those cuts if needed.\nRead more",

Yet they can be poignant, dramatic reminders of friends and family that meant a lot to characters too, depending on who the shambling corpse used to be.

Instead I played RTS games as though they were city-builders, with the added bonus of absolutely steamrolling through the AI when I'd had enough fun.\nThis was true of basically every RTS I played back then. In Starcraft I'd amass an army of Protoss Carriers and launch them across the map. In Supreme Commander, I'd tech all the way up to the Experimental Weapons, and then send the colossal CZAR Mothership to Independence-Day the entire enemy base. But my favourite variation of this was in Impossible Creatures: a wonderful early noughties strategy game where you create your own units by stitching together parts from different animals.\n Read more",

Where it excels is in its action movie sequences, but it also takes itself too seriously at times and struggles to balance the sensitivities of conflict within its choppy story.\nRead more",

For content creation, they're by far the best CPUs AMD has ever produced - but for gaming, there is another option: the Ryzen 7 5800X3D. This CPU remains stunningly fast in some games that can take advantage of its uniquely huge L3 cache, and best of all works with a wide range of inexpensive AM4 motherboards with cheap DDR4 RAM. \nPound for pound, it's by far the best AMD CPU for gaming on the market - and now it's been reduced to just $329 at Antonline via Ebay. That's a healthy $120 reduction from its US MSRP of $449, and a great price overall given the level of gaming performance it provides. \nRead more",

Whenever I load them up, I just can’t help but pause every five seconds for a breather. Multiplayer games are far more manageable, though, and often also turn stifled screams into contagious laughter as your friends terrorise each other.\nIf you’re a scaredy cat like me and would rather scream at the horrors of your unhinged mates than at unpredictable AIs and scripted jump scares, then you’re in the right spot. Here are five games in which your mates can play as the monster. Some are creepy, some are cute, and none of them will force you to run around alone. If you're looking to get monstrous yourself this Halloween, Liam's done a list all about games that make you the monster. No overlap, promise.\nRead more",

          "description": "This God of War: Ragnarok ad is the wildest thing I've seen in a while\nSony is known to go pretty full out to promote their games, and with the game's release just over a week away, they've pulled out all of the stops for God of War: Ragnarok. Their newest ad features none other than the likes of famed actor and director Ben Stiller dressed up as Kratos himself, alongside Lebron James and John Travolta.\nThe premise of the ad is that Kratos and Atreus father/son dynamic is something that all parents can relate to, and so Stiller is hosting a kind of God of War-themed parenting support group. He discusses his own struggles in relating to his son, and attempts to help James and Travolta connect with their children, too. By the way, those are actually all of their real children shown in the short, which is pretty cool if you ask me.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQH0YK1rGVc\nKratos' newfound difficulties with fatherhood have been a meme since the first game in the God of War reboot series came out back in 2018, so it's a smart move for Sony to lean into that. Is it weird to see Ben Stiller in a Kratos outfit? Yeah. Am I confused as to why they chose Ben Stiller, Lebron James, and John Travolta of all people to be the faces of their marketing campaign for God of War? Absolutely. Is this whole thing kinda cringey? I'd say so.\nAt this point, they have to know that Ragnarok is going to be one of the biggest launches of the year, so at least Sony seems to be having fun with it. It's kind of a pet peeve of mine to see games taking themselves too seriously, so I still prefer this to some edgy skit about how God of War is going to redefine gaming or whatever.\nThe post Ben Stiller dons a Kratos look for this God of War: Ragnarok ad appeared first on Destructoid.",

The story continues the journey of Guybrush Threepwood, as a new and dramatic series of events takes place on Mêlée Island.\nHeading home\nAs Zoey wrote for us in the initial review, Return to Monkey Island is a follow-up to the series that's got a good amount of callbacks and references. For Monkey Island fans who haven't got around to it yet though, the new platforms provide a chance to finally check it out. And hey, Game Pass makes it easy to see if this kind of adventure is your cup of tea.\nReturn to Monkey Island joins a pretty stellar lineup of Game Pass games this month, too. Obisidian's historical murder-mystery Pentiment is also due up on the Pass. As is Somerville, the extraterrestrial thriller. And if you really just need to lose hours watching bats and skeletons explode, Vampire Survivors is on-deck too.\nReturn to Monkey Island hits PS5 and Xbox Series X|S on November 8.\n \nThe post Return to Monkey Island hits PS5 and Xbox Series X/S next week appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Scissor Me\nIn what might be perhaps the single most niche emporium ever established, Japan will be getting a \"pop-up shop\" entirely devoted to the cult franchise Clock Tower. Situated in \"The Akihabara Container\" in Tokyo, the store will offer up a variety of exclusive goodies pertaining to the Gothic survival horror series.\nThe Clock Tower faithful can visit the location from November 3, rolling out fistfuls of Yen in order to bag merchandise based upon the original Clock Tower (1995) and its sequel Clock Tower 2: The Struggle Within (1998). Up for grabs will be mugs, keychains, wall scrolls, clothing apparel, standees, posters, and more, with the piece de resistance being an old-school alarm clock that plays the game's title theme!\nCheck out the goodies in the flyer below, courtesy of Famitsu and Siliconera.\n\nThe Clock Tower series combines classic point-and-click gameplay with the survival horror tropes of the mid-'90s, as protagonists pick their way through creepy locations in an effort to stay one step ahead of the terrifying killer \"Scissorman\". Inspired by Dario Argento's bug-filled 1985 flick, Phenomena, the Clock Tower games are praised for their mood, classic visuals, and unnerving atmosphere, but the series as a whole has always been hampered by slow, and in some cases archaic, gameplay mechanics. Regardless, they have found their own dedicated following — as all horror franchises tend to do.\nRegardless, it's incredibly quirky to see an entire store devoted to its presence, and I'm sure fans will make sure they grab a hold of as many goodies as possible before the doors close for good at the end of the month. The Clock Tower store is situated in The Akihabara Container in Tokyo, Japan, and will operate from November 3 — November 29.\nThe post Clock Tower pop-up shop coming to Japan this month appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Simulate a new dwarven life in December\nIt's time to break earth and set up a new home. The impossibly deep simulator Dwarf Fortress has set a Steam and Itch launch date of December 6, 2022.\nThis infamous engine for incredible internet stories is often perceived as pretty dense. But as part of the Steam launch, Bay 12 Games is also rolling out several major draws for newcomers to make dwarven life a bit easier to manage.\nFirst off, the graphical tile set. Rather than ASCII characters moving around, Dwarf Fortress has pixel visuals you can pick up on a bit easier. Modders and community members have made these tools before, but Steam Dwarf Fortress arrives with a packed-in tile set.\nSecondly, the new player experience has been updated to include tutorials. Via the Steam page, these tutorials will guide you through the process of building your first fortress and keeping all the dwarves inside happy.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K7T5LXQPJI\nOther than that, this is largely still Dwarf Fortress. It's still a massive, simulated world of possibilities and potential disaster. All it needs is a few intrepid dwarves.\nBuilding the fortress\nDwarf Fortress has been the subject of many lengthy forum posts and storytimes. Much like EVE Online, it's a game that's endlessly fascinating to read about, but seems intimidating from the outside too.\nWith a Steam launch, updated graphics, and new player experience, this might be the time for me to give Dwarf Fortress an honest go of it. I've read enough stories. I'm ready to establish my own beautiful fortress, then watch it fall apart to infighting and chaos.\nDevelopers Tarn and Zach Adams have been working on this game for ages, and seem set to keep doing so. And maybe this version is just the right jumping-on point as they dive further into what this simulation can possibly do.\nDwarf Fortress hits Steam and Itch on December 6, 2022.\nThe post Dwarf Fortress gets a Steam release date for December appeared first on Destructoid.",

Let's go over both briefly as we head into the holiday season.\nSo My Nintendo Platinum Points expire after six months from collection. It's important to game the system as much as possible: meaning, there are ways to bank missions and not actually complete them until you need them. Our guide goes into more detail on this, and how you can use Fire Emblem Heroes to your advantage.\nGold Points, which are more like cash that can be used directly for eShop payments, expire in 12 months. There's a lot more leeway here with the expanded timeframe, but note that since a lot of folks make purchases in December, you might be coming up on a time period where a bunch will expire.\nTo check both of these timelines, you'll want to head to the \"Point Summary\" link at the bottom of the main My Nintendo login page, then click on point expiration.\nHow to earn more My Nintendo Points for the holidays\nAs a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time.

While the characters and settings all look pretty superb, perhaps the best element on show here is the recreation of the film's aesthetic — its visual tone, its heightened use of vulgar color, and its unsettling emphasis on the juxtapositioned shadows.\nIt's looking pretty faithful, that's for sure. Check out the comparison shots in this new trailer.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqS8joebwLo\nAs for the game outline itself, it is believed that KKfOS will be a chase-and-fight multiplayer title in the vein of Dead by Daylight, Predator: Hunting Grounds, and the upcoming Texas Chain Saw Massacre. A team of Crescent Cove civilians will take on the Cirque de Puree itself, attempting to prevent the Klown invasion while staying one step ahead of their clumsy gloved hands — lest you end up a ball of cotton candy or a mound of acid cream pie. It's a fun idea, and it will be great to see the title in action as it continues along the road to the big top.\nKiller Klowns from Outer Space: The Game is currently in development for PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

According to the figures, over 200 nations have played for a total of 15 billion minutes, scoring 4.3 billion goals across the 1.7 billion matches. The top male goal scorer is Manchester United and England National player Marcus Rashford, while the top female scorer is Chelsea Women's Sam Kerr.

As Eurogamer points out, some users are getting different \"triggers\" for the emails, that range from purchasing content, to not purchasing content. So it seems as if they're trying to get an array of feedback from pretty much everyone. As of publication, I personally have not gotten an email yet.\nWe're gonna need a bigger survey\nAs we've pointed out (particularly in the past week), Overwatch 2 is not running very smoothly post-launch. Some of the microtransactions feel particularly predatory, and one of the first major seasonal events isn't up to par.\nWhile the game itself does still mostly feel like Overwatch, the main thing I noticed when first booting it up (and still deal with now) is how busy the game is. The season pass system isn't an upgrade, and I'm particularly worried about future seasons, especially ones that add characters into the mix.\nOne of the chief issues is that Blizzard, when erasing the original Overwatch and adding this free-to-play scheme, didn't really add much value: even for premium season pass owners. Maybe the PVE update will change that, but most of us are wondering when that will even happen (and some of you will be long gone, and won't wait that long to find out how it impacts Overwatch 2).\nThe post Blizzard sends out surveys asking how to improve Overwatch 2 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Still more questions remain\nKojima Productions has revealed another cast member who will be joining Elle Fanning in the studio's as-yet-unrevealed new title — Shioli Kutsuna, perhaps best known for their appearance as Yukio in Deadpool 2, will star in the new game in an as-yet-undisclosed role.\nShioli Kutsuna's presence was confirmed in another \"headshot\" teaser image, which sees the 29-year-old Japanese-Australian actor staring dead-on into the lens, engulfed in red light and emblazoned with the question \"Where Am I?\", similar imagery was used to tease the identity, and the eventual reveal of, Elle Fanning, who film fans will recognize from cinema jaunts such as Disney's Maleficent and Nicolas Winding Refn's excellent psychological horror The Neon Demon.\nProducer Hideo Kojima is yet to spill the beans on the new title, which is believed to be a brand new IP, rather than a follow-up to his studio's 2019 release, Death Stranding. Kojima Productions is currently working on the new game in tandem with a sequel to Death Stranding itself. And, given Kojima's close relationship with industry pundit Geoff Keighley, it seems likely that we will be hearing more about the mysterious new project at the upcoming Game Awards — currently set to take place on December 8.\nHideo Kojima’s New Game Casts Shioli Kutsuna [WhatIfGaming]\n\nThe post Shioli Kutsuna joins the cast of Kojima Productions’ mystery game appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Over three million consoles moved in last quarter\nSony Interactive Entertainment has released its financial results for fiscal year ending September 30, 2022, which shows that its most recent hardware platform, PlayStation 5 (PS5), has smashed past 25 million global shipments since its initial launch in November 2020.\nAccording to the data, the shiny white behemoth shipped 3.3 million units in the most recent quarter, more or less matching the same period in 2021 and thus presenting steady sales for the (admittedly expensive) hardware. While there have been some struggles getting the ninth generation off to a strong start — impacted by production woes, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the cost of living crisis — it appears that sales of the PS5 system remain relatively comfortable for the time being.\nIn addition to the hardware figures, SIE also revealed that there are currently 45.4 million PlayStation Plus subscribers, though this figure is down some 1.8 million users from the same time frame one year ago. Much like Microsoft's the Xbox Game Pass service, it seems that PlayStation is continually struggling to grow its subscriber base, which had seen nothing but growth until the 2021 economy slump. Still, 45 million players is nothing to be sniffed at, and so it is unlikely that the publisher will be too concerned.\nFurther decline was seen in total game sales, with PS4 and PS5 combined software sales down a huge 13.9 million units over 2021, for a grand total of 62.5 million games sold. 63% of all full game sales were digital purchases — demonstrating that while the digital market continues its inevitable growth, physical media is not quite ready to be consigned to the garbage pile just yet.\nThe post PS5 hits 25 million global shipments milestone appeared first on Destructoid.",

In addition, the PS5 version will feature a new fishing mini-game, allowing the player to gather rare breeds of finned wonderment to display in an in-game aquarium.

Arc System Works is releasing the updated version of the PS2 RPG onto Steam on November 10.\nThis remastered version has already been released for Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4. Now, PC players will get a chance to check out this older dungeon crawler. The Steam page is live here.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgFfhjaPoZc\nKowloon High School Chronicle first launched for PlayStation 2 in Japan, back in 2004. The new remaster not only brings it to new systems, but adds some revamped graphics.\nThe set-up of Kowloon is pretty interesting, too. You play a young treasure hunter masquerading as a transfer student. During the day, the player attends class and hangs out with friends, using a novel and slightly bizarre conversation system to foster relationships.\nThen at night, the protagonist and their party can venture into the labyrinths and catacombs beneath the school, in pursuit of hidden treasure. This is where it becomes a first-person dungeon crawler, with some pretty neat puzzles.\nDaily life of treasure hunters\nI've played a solid chunk of the Nintendo Switch version of Kowloon High School Chronicle, and it's definitely a different kind of RPG. Between the style, music, and life sim elements, it's got a fair bit of Persona in it.\nBut I'm also a big fan of crunchy, weird interfaces and old internet UI. I mean, look at this wanted ad from the game's in-universe internet.\n\nIf you want something offbeat, this might be what you're looking for. Especially those of you looking to load up the Steam Deck with RPGs before the holidays.\nKowloon High School Chronicle hits PC via Steam on November 10, and is also currently available on PS4 and Switch.\nThe post Kowloon High School Chronicle hunts for treasure on Steam in November appeared first on Destructoid.",

I know one of the request for 2018 was the ability to maybe have the stats you want, but you know, give Kratos the runway look you want. So this is a question from SpiritWolf and a lot of other people; Will there be an armor transmog system?\"\nMihir Sheth: \"The short answer is yes. There is a way to do it…it’s there in the game.\"\n\nThe answer is a bit cryptic, and it's unclear whether or not it's going to be a free-for-all anything goes model (where you can just toggle it), or if it needs to be unlocked/requires a reagent/consumable of some kind. Either way, it's confirmed in some form.\nAt this point with any AAA game with gear, transmog is not only a highly-requested feature, but expected.

          "description": "An adventure classic is being remade from the ground up\nCyan is remaking another one of its classics, this time in Riven. The studio has announced it is developing a Riven remake from the ground up.\nRiven, or Riven: The Sequel to Myst, will be getting a full, modern remake. Cyan's already produced a remake for Myst, and it seems like this will be a similar undertaking.\nIn an FAQ online, Cyan addresses the basics. Yes, this is a remake from the ground up, not a remaster. The new Riven remake will also be fully traversable in 3D.\nNo details on platforms or dates have been announced yet. But this will be a new game, so expect to buy a new product, rather than get it for free if you already have the classic Riven.\nAs to why Cyan is doing this now, and after 25 years? Here's their explanation:\n\"Riven is one of the most highly regarded games in Cyan’s history. We didn’t want to approach it lightly or frivolously. Cyan is a small indie studio. We wanted to make sure we could take on such a difficult, costly and complicated endeavor – and do it well.\"\n\nhttps://twitter.com/cyanworlds/status/1587065601339424770\nRemaking the sequel to Myst\nThere was also a fan project in the works, the Starry Expanse Project, to remake Riven. Alongside news of the remake, Cyan confirms that project has been ceased development. The Starry Expanse team continues to exist, independent from Cyan, though the two teams collaborated early on to kickstart the official remake development, according to Cyan's letter. One member of the Starry Expanse team has also been hired by Cyan.\n\"So for the first time publicly, we are happy to report that our effort to remake Riven officially here at Cyan is alive and well, and it was helped by the Starry Expanse team’s years of effort, enabling us to begin the huge task of rebuilding Riven from scratch,\" said Cyan. \"With a very focused development team here at Cyan, Riven is well on its way to being reborn!\"\nThe post Riven, the sequel to Myst, is getting a remake appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The deal kicks off with the upcoming Iron Man game\nEA and Marvel have locked in a deal for at least three action-adventure games. Electronic Arts will develop the titles, set in the Marvel universe, for PC and console.\nThe deal was first reported today by Bloomberg, followed by an announcement from EA. Marvel and Electronic Arts will collaborate on \"at least three\" new action-adventure games, available for PC and console.\nThese games will be original stories set in the Marvel universe, and we already know about one of them. EA Motive was recently confirmed to be working on an Iron Man game.\n\"At Marvel, we strive to find best-in-class teams who can take our characters on heroic journeys in ways they haven’t before, and collaborating with Electronic Arts will help us achieve that,\" said Marvel Games executive VP Jay Ong. \"We pride ourselves on being enthusiastic, creative collaborators with developers so they have the freedom to create something deeply unique and truly remarkable. The team at Motive is getting started on that with their Iron Man video game and we can’t wait for players to learn more in the far future.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GLbwkfhYZk\nA Marvel-ous deal\nEA has a history with the Star Wars series already. Games like Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order have done pretty well. Well enough, in fact, that Respawn's working on several more Star Wars projects.\nWith a Marvel deal locked in, it looks like Electronic Arts is deepening its ties to Disney properties.\nThe Marvel universe isn't just stopping there, though. Skydance recently teased its upcoming Captain America-Black Panther project. (Skydance is also working on a Star Wars project.)\nPlus, Marvel's Midnight Suns is just around the corner in December. And Marvel Snap is gradually taking over everyone's phones. The Marvel games roll-out just keeps growing.\nThe post EA locks in a deal with Marvel for at least three games appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "$5 straight cash compared to 700 Overwatch bux\nYikes! That's just about the only thing that can sum up a lot of Overwatch 2 news post-launch, but this Overwatch 2 charm situation is so funny it has to be shared.\nOver on the Overwatch Reddit, user hi_im_redbeard shared an anecdote that showcased how out of control the monetization scheme is in Overwatch 2. In short, they purchased a real life Pachimari keychain/charm that they can hold in their hand for cheaper than it costs to buy the same Overwatch 2 charm in-game. Showing their work, the Pachimari charm (literally just an in-game side item, almost NFT-like in nature) is 700 Overwatch Coins, which is more than $5 (which converts to 500 Coins). Yep, you have to do the standard scummy \"buy more than you need\" conversion here, so it's even more expensive than roughly $7 if you need to top up.\nThere are plenty of economic nuances afoot, and this wouldn't be the first time something like this happened; as some games (Pokemon Unite included) can put out insanely high-priced limited-run skins that are more expensive than an action figure of the character in question. But this particular incident showcases how Overwatch 2, in its move to \"free-to-play\" (and erasing the original premium game) has shoved in even more ways to monetize its audience with new cosmetics.\nWhen some fans are asking to bring loot boxes back, you know you have a monetization problem. It'll be interesting to see just how much content Overwatch 2 gets over time, how it's even further monetized, and what the PVE element brings to the table (more monetization?).\nThe post Hilariously, someone pointed out that it’s cheaper to buy this Overwatch 2 charm in real life compared to the game appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Audacity\nWizards of the Coast has provided us with another exclusive Magic Arena card (that's also coming to paper Magic of course): Audacity. It's set to debut in the The Brothers' War set, which is out on November 11 via pre-release, November 15 in Arena, and November 18 in paper Magic.\nAs a reminder, here's a quick rundown of the lore for the release, to set the mood:\n\"Through nefarious means, the evil Phyrexians establish a foothold on Dominaria. They secretly transform ordinary citizens into deadly sleeper agents who go about their lives, ignorant of their new purpose. As word of the Phyrexian incursion spreads, the people of Dominaria attempt to band together as the sleeper agents threaten to tear them apart.\"\n\nThe Brothers' War is going to have all sorts of lore implications, and follows the Dominaria United set that arrived back in September. From here, we'll be delving even further into the story of the Phyrexians, with Phyrexia: All Will Be One, slated for January 2023. It's a pretty busy block for Magic, as the Dominaria storyline/setting once again is hitting it pretty big with the community.\nDestructoid's exclusive Magic Arena card: Audacity\n\nAs for the card itself, it's an enchantment aura called Audacity that costs G, enchants a creature, and provides a +2/+0 and trample bonus. When Audacity is put into the graveyard from the battlefield, you draw a card.\nThis is the sort of thing you wouldn't mind drawing in most Magic formats, limited included. A low cost always ensures that it's generally playable (or very playable), and although it's not a flash/instant-speed enchantment. Plus, the art from Rudy Siswanto is killer and wonderfully showcases the direct conflict from the lore.\nAs usual, I can't wait to pick one up and put it in a toploader!\nThe post Exclusive: Here’s a look at a new The Brothers’ War card coming to paper Magic and Magic Arena appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Producer Cory Barlog shared his frustration\nA situation that led to God of War Ragnarok being leaked has led to a full confirmation of said leak from the game's producer (Cory Barlog), a bit of venting, and a public warning.\nAs Barlog points out, a retailer has broken street date and sold God of War Ragnarok roughly two weeks before the November 9 release date; leading to posts online about the game, including screens, and down the line, potentially spoiler-related content. Consider this your warning!\nHere's a full recap of Barlog's sentiments on Twitter over the weekend:\n\"You know, right now, I can really understand the benefit of having just an installer on the physical disc. Smh. A retailer selling the game nearly TWO WEEKS before release. just so disappointing. Sorry to everyone that you have to dodge the spoilers if you want to play the game fresh. completely fucking stupid you have to do this. this is not at all how any of us at SMS wanted things to go. To be clear, I was expressing my frustration in the first tweet. not advocating for that at all. Not the future i want as a gamer or dev. just so beyond frustrated. Feel terrible for the team. This whole ordeal is incredibly stressful for us all. Mental health break time.\"\n\nOn the bright side, for Sony, God of War as a whole is a pretty impenetrable franchise that people will buy regardless. By that same token, it's also so massive that a leak was almost inevitable: though several weeks early is not really the norm in many cases.\nThe big takeaway for everyone: be careful if you want to avoid spoilers!\nThe post Warning, God of War Ragnarok leaked early, so watch out for spoilers appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "According to a Bloomberg report, video game publisher Embracer has shut down Onoma, the studio formerly known as Square Enix Montreal, just months after its acquisition. Some staff will be transferred to Eidos Montreal, another studio owned by Embracer. This news comes just a few weeks after Onoma underwent a rebranding process where it adopted the new name.\nOnoma was best known for its work on the Go series, turn-based spin-offs of popular Eidos Interactive titles designed for mobile. This includes Hitman Go, Lara Croft Go, and Deus Ex Go. Their most recent work was Tomb Raider Reloaded, which came to mobile devices earlier this year, and their future plans involved a title based on Avatar: The Last Airbender.\nEarlier this year, Onoma was just one part of a much larger series of Embracer’s acquisitions, which included Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montreal. In August, Embracer proceeded to acquire Limited Run Games, Tripwire Interactive, Tuxedo Labs, the IP rights to The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, and several more studios.\nThe Bloomberg report also says that the closure is part of a cost-cutting initiative, and that Eidos Montreal will have projects scaled back and cut as well. Some of these resources will be redirected to assist in the development of a game in the Fable franchise, led by Playground Games.\n[Source: Bloomberg]\nWere you a fan of the Go series? Do you think acquisitions are good for the games industry? Let us know in the comments.",

          "description": "The official Sonic the Hedgehog YouTube channel has uploaded an animated short titled “Sonic Frontiers Prologue: Divergence.” Starring Knuckles, the short reveals how he wound up on the island players explore in Sonic Frontiers. You can watch the six-minute animation in its entirety below.\n\n\nIn the trailer, Knuckles provides a voice-over explanation of his background up until now, including the fact that he was tasked with guarding the Master Emerald, a relic that hasn’t appeared in the Sonic series for quite some time. The trailer ends with Knuckles absolutely demolishing some robots, and while we’ve received no indication that he will be playable in Sonic Frontiers, that sequence makes me hope he will be.\nKnuckles has been a core Sonic character for most of the franchise’s existence, so it’s not surprising that he’s making an appearance in the blue blur’s latest adventure. While this animated prologue gives us insight into how he wound up on the island, it’s still not entirely clear why, especially when it comes to the appearance of Sage (a new character introduced in Sonic Frontiers) at the end of the trailer. We’ll have to wait for the full game to find out.\nThe past month has been full of Sonic news. We got a December 14 release date for Sonic Prime, Sonic Frontiers got a trailer confirming Super Sonic would be playable in the game, and we learned that the Sonic series has sold over 1.5 billion copies worldwide.

The publication reports that only U.S. subscribers are seeing this January 15 premiere date in the show's description so I opened up the HBO Max app on my phone to check and sure enough, it's there. Check it out in my screenshot below: \n\"A preview of the post-apocalyptic drama series based on the critically acclaimed video game,\" The Last of Us: Season 1 Sneak Peek's description reads. \"Premieres January 15.\" \nThis lines up with what's expected of an HBO series, too, as the subscription services' shows are not usually dropped in bulk, like on Netflix. Instead, HBO sticks to the weekly release popularized with standard television, and that the description says the show simply premieres January 15 means new episodes of The Last of Us will likely release each week. January 15 is also a Sunday, and episodes for HBO's biggest shows typically release on Sunday evenings, like House of the Dragon. My money's on new episodes of this show dropping each Sunday for however many weeks at 9 p.m. ET. Only time will tell, but fortunately, we don't have to wait too much longer now if HBO's description is correct. \nIn the meantime, watch this teaser for HBO's The Last of Us and then watch this full trailer for the show.

The news was announced through a blog post on the Spry Fox website, which also answers some questions about the future of the studio.\nSpry Fox says the partnership will not change any of their upcoming plans, meaning that Cozy Grove 2 and their unnamed non-violent MMO will still be developed as planned. Instead, Netflix will provide them with financial support, which Spry Fox says will allow them to “stop stressing” about how their games will generate profit. Despite all of Netflix’s current games existing through their mobile app, the blog post does not mention anything about platform exclusivity.\nSpry Fox joins five other in-house game developers at Netflix: Next Games (Stranger Things: Puzzle Tales), Night School Studio (Oxenfree), Boss Fight Entertainment (Dungeon Boss), and two internal studios in Helsinki, Finland and southern California.\nNetflix launched its games collection just over a year ago, in November of 2021. Currently, subscribers can play over 30 games on their mobile app, including Into the Breach, Spiritfarer, and Poinpy. On top of that, Netflix has over 50 more games in development. Have you had a chance to play any games on the Netflix app? Let us know in the comments.",

          "description": "When Electronic Arts' Motive Studios announced its Iron Man game in September, we learned it would be the first of a multi-game deal between the publisher and Marvel. That was a vaguely defined arrangement at the time, but we now know the partnership will produce a minimum of three titles.\nEA announced the news in a press release, with the publisher describing it as a “long-term” deal that could extend beyond three games based on the wording. The release also specifies these titles will be action-adventure games for consoles and PC, each featuring original stories in the Marvel universe. \nIt's worth clarifying that EA is not getting exclusive rights to Marvel like it had with Star Wars. There are multiple Marvel games in the works at various studios, including the recently announced Captain America/Black Panther game from Amy Hennig’s Skydance New Media. \n“We have been long-time fans of Marvel and their impressive leadership, so this is a remarkable moment for our developers as well as our players and fans,” said EA COO Laura Miele. “We look forward to welcoming Marvel into the EA family of creators and know this collaboration will produce exceptional experiences for our players. We can’t wait to see players' reactions when they suit up as Iron Man and do the extraordinary things this Super Hero is known for.”\nWe’re curious to learn what other Marvel projects are on the docket and which EA studios are behind them. Motive’s Iron Man, a single-player third-person action game, is currently in pre-production, so it’s a long way from release (the team is also making the Dead Space remake). What heroes would you like to see EA tackle, and which studio do you want to see bring them to life? Let us know in the comments.",

The wacky cat-breeding roguelike is the brainchild of Super Meat Boy co-creator and The Binding of Isaac mastermind Edmund McMillen and has been in and out of the works for a decade. After being announced, put on hold, and restarted, it appears to have a new release window. \nMcMillen tweeted a gif of two of the game’s adorable cats engaging in what we'll call an intimate cat exercise. The tweet links to the game’s Steam page, which lists a 2024 release window.\nHold on to your Butts!https://t.co/wDBOizNXGl pic.twitter.com/MESXJFFXsh\nOctober 28, 2022\nWhat the heck is Mewgenics? The game tasks players with collecting and breeding hundreds of cats to train and send into battle. Or, as the Steam description puts it, Mewgenics is a “turn-based legacy roguelike draft sim about cats!” The game apparently boasts “100s of hours” of gameplay, multiple classes with over 50 unique abilities, over 200 enemies, and other features. \nMewgenics was first announced in 2012, with McMillen at the time describing it as \"By far the strangest project I've ever worked on.” McMillen has worked on it alongside Tyler Glaiel; the pair previously partnered for The End is Nigh, among other titles. The game was originally billed as a cross between Pokémon, The Sims, and Animal Crossing, and had first been planned to release in 2014. It was, of course, delayed, and its development was put on indefinite hold in 2016 when McMillen began work on The Legend of Bum-Bo, which launched in 2019. At the time, McMillen was unsure of Mewgenics’ future, but in 2018 he announced he was remaking the game to be released in “a few years.” \nThe game is slated to launch for PC, though whether or not it’s still coming to iOS is unknown. Are you still interested in Mewgenics? Let us know in the comments! For more on Edmund McMillen, we spoke with him last December where he discussed his life and career, including Mewgenics, which you can read in this interview feature.",

Meanwhile, players can expect cards starring Regieleki and Regidrago.\nThe Pokémon Company sent us several booster packs so we could open them and see what we pull. While it may just be dumb luck, I feel like this expansion gave me better pulls than any others in recent memory. As I cracked these open, I was met with several attractive full-art cards, as well as some gorgeous Trainer Gallery cards. I even managed to pull two of the three new Radiant Pokémon cards. \nThis expansion adds over 190 cards to the ever-growing library of Pokémon cards.

Players experience the first-person adventure through the lens of a body camera to provide a more realistic, claustrophobic trek into its terrifying world. \nThe game, created by two designers, draws inspiration from found footage films. The name shares the same initials as P.T., which I can’t imagine is coincidental. Players explore a series of video files as they control a person searching for their lost dog, Teddy. Expect to encounter some very creepy phenomena, and the realistic graphics (rendered in Unreal Engine 5) aim to sell the bodycam perspective effectively.

We respected her,\" confirming her death. \nSega has since confirmed Kodama's death, citing that she had passed in May, according to IGN. Further details around her death will not be shared out of respect for her family's privacy, Sega says. \n\"We pray that the deceased will rest in peace, and we offer our gratitude for her enormous contributions to Sega,\" Sega of Japan says, as translated by IGN Japan. \nKodama's journey through game development began in the 1980s when she started as a graphic designer for Master System and Sega Genesis games like Altered Beast and Sonic the Hedgehog. She was the main artist for Phantasy Star and continued to work on the series' visuals team until Phantasy Star IV: The End of the Millennium, which she directed.\nOther credits include Mega Drive versions of Sorcerian, Alex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, and more. After directing Phantasy Star IV, she directed Magic Knight Rayearth in 1995 before becoming a producer and development lead on Sega's Skies of Arcadia. She continued to work in games development in some capacity until at least 2018, where she was the lead producer on the Sega compilation title Sega Ages. \nIn 2019, she was recognized with the Pioneer Award at GDC 2019. \nThe staff at Game Informer extends their condolences to Kodama's family.",

Today's trailer makes me wish this game was coming out this month – it'd be such a great Halloween game – but it's not due out until sometime during the first half of 2023. It will hit Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC, as well as Xbox and PC Game Pass when it's released.

Spawned in 2007 by Capcom veterans, including Resident Evil creator Shinji Mikami and Devil May Cry and Okami mastermind Hideki Kamiya, the studio became a haven for these minds to create new franchises under the freedom of independence. Early success like MadWorld turned heads, but Platinum’s third title, Bayonetta, cemented it as one of the game industry’s premier action studios.\nLaunching in Japan in 2009 and hitting U.S. shores in 2010, Bayonetta revamped and, in some ways, improved the stylish action of its spiritual predecessor, Devil May Cry. The bewitching adventure reinvented and reinvigorated the stylish action genre; Platinum created its magnum opus in only two years. Unfortunately, sales didn’t match the reception, and Sega, the game’s original publisher, passed on a sequel. Despite fans’ cries, Bayonetta seemingly ended the series before it could take off.\nNintendo stepped up to answer those pleas by agreeing to publish a follow-up. Bayonetta 2 arrived in 2014 as a Wii U exclusive. The sequel proved Bayonetta wasn’t a one-hit wonder, becoming one of the year’s best games with some fans believing it surpassed its predecessor. The success also proved the family-friendly Nintendo had no problem letting the franchise remain true to its Mature-rated self.\nRead more...",

You can also catch up on previous episodes by visiting our new Game Informer Shows YouTube channel or watching the embedded video below. \nMetal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look.

          "description": "Are you spooked? We are too with this spooky release date, even if nothing in OpenTTD itself is spooky. Luckily, I can offer you the first testing release of the 13.X release series. We collected whatever we could find on the cutting room floor to get you a Halloween release. Some of the higlights of this release include: Build NewGRF objects over an era with click-and-drag. Wider rivers on map generation. Improved handling of HiDPI and mixed-DPI screens. Some more GUI improvements like a cleaned up finance window. Many bug-fixes (over 50 of them), tweaks, changes, and other additions. (As ever, see the changelog for further details). The usual titlegame competition has been announced on the forums. See the page for the exact competition rules if you are interested. Download Changelog Bug tracker",
