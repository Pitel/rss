Now that’s been replaced by new trends like deckbuilders and extraction shooters, though there are still some worthwhile fresh sandbox releases to be found every now and then. One such game is Core Keeper, which has been in early access for the past two years on PC and only recently hit its 1.0 release state. Fortunately, the wait was worth it, as Core Keeper is deeply enjoyable and addictive.\nGameplay in Core Keeper follows the traditional survival-sandbox game template wherein you push out slowly from a rugged base of operations and slowly learn more about your world as you mine materials, fight enemies, and upgrade equipment in a constant battle against the overwhelming forces of nature.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "The best 3D Sonic game..? Yes.\nHoly moly folks, Sega actually did it. After the disappointment of Sonic Forces, the glitchy mess of Sonic Colors Ultimate, and the divisive nature of Sonic Frontiers, the publisher has delivered what is undoubtedly the very best 3D Sonic game yet with Sonic X Shadow Generations. It gracefully revisits a beloved modern classic while introducing an extra campaign that we almost dismissed as a quaint bonus, but actually wound up being the star of the show.\nSince some Nintendo fans may not have experienced the console version of 2011’s Sonic Generations (with its release limited to the 3DS), the general gist is that ‘Classic’ and ‘Modern’ versions of the Blue Blur team up to take on an entity known as ‘The Time Eater’ after it merges their timelines and traps them within the mysterious ‘White Space’. The two must revisit iconic stages from the franchise’s history, with Classic Sonic zipping along a 2D plane and Modern Sonic boosting his way across 3D environments.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Nova say Nova Again.\nSome in the UK may know comedy TV personality Adam Buxton, who was once the counterpart of Joe Cornish in the Adam and Joe Show (1996-2001), and, as recently as 2020, was still guesting on popular Channel 4 panel shows. Nowadays, he's more well-known for The Adam Buxton Podcast, but in 1999 he walked into a London-based video game store where I was working as staff, and, retrieving a copy of Raiden DX from the Japanese PlayStation section, asked if I was familiar with it. I told him if he liked the series, it was by far the best entry and a superb arcade port full of bells and whistles. He immediately handed over the cash, wished me a good day, and left. I didn’t bother to say, “hey buddy, I watch you on TV”, but I was impressed with his gaming choice.\nRaiden, you see, is like a secret handshake amongst the shooting game hardcore, a distinguished Masonic-like fraternity of middle-aged men who get enthusiastic about blowing things up with spaceships. It’s known by many, but played seriously by few, and since its debut in 1990 its myriad sequels have been largely overlooked by the mainstream. Regardless, it’s an excellent series, from the Raiden Fighters spinoffs to the newer polygonal sequels. So, why the celebrity flex? Well, it left an impression. Not just because it was Adam Buxton, whose TV show was popular at the time, but because I never forgot that Adam Buxton was both a shoot-em-up player and Raiden fan. That was cool.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

So let's say I'm ambivalent about this new adventure featuring Max Caulfield, the returning hero of Life Is Strange, and time-travelling photographer whose powers have resurfaced after years of off-screen atrophy. I've been deeply moved by individual scenes in this sequel. By the end I was sorry to leave its characters behind. At the same time (please now imagine my face is splitting into a second, colour-washed expression with wobbly VFX) I am relieved it's over, so I don't have to deal with the inconsistent behaviour of those characters, the flimsy plot, and a convoluted approach to murder mystery. \nRead more",

          "description": "In case you don't know the headline reference, Orpheus was a mythical Greek musician who famously descended to the underworld to rescue his snake-bitten lover, Eurydice. The underworld's rulers, Hades and Persephone, were massively bummed out by Orpheus's emo lyre-playing, and swiftly agreed to let him lead Eurydice's soul upward to the waking world, with the extremely simple proviso that he not look back at her till they're both on the surface.\nBeing a love-drunk spannerhead, however, Orpheus couldn't resist a quick peek at Eurydice after crossing the threshold - and the result is a timeless moral about human frailty and the specific truism that you should absolutely never date musicians, which Australian developers Oppolyon Studios appear to have totally ignored in their otherwise-redolent game about kicking your brother's soul out of hell.\n Read more",

You won't have much time to write in Static Dread, sadly. The world has ended, the oceans teem with squirmy, extra-dimensional lifeforms, and it's your job as the apparent sole surviving lighthouse keeper to distinguish vessels loaded with eldritch horrors from vessels loaded with people who need saving from eldritch horrors. \nGoing by the teaser trailer, below, this appears to be comparable to playing border guard in Papers, Please, but it's less political and more tentacular. You field queries over the radio, run your finger down a clipboard, and decide whether to kindle the lamps or beg the coastguard to blast that ship back to hell. There's a dialogue line in the trailer which I, personally, would consider highly untrustworthy. \"It's consuming my team!\" screams a self-described ship captain. \"Please, send help! Gosh...\" Look, \"friend\", no genuine human being says \"gosh\" in an emergency situation. Not even British human beings say \"gosh\" in an emergency situation.

          "description": "Rebecca Jones (RPS in peace) really liked 10 Dead Doves when she wrote about it back in 2022, saying it reminded her of why she “loves weird low-budget spooks so much”. Discovering such an interesting project speaks to curiosity and taste on her part, but me? I am simply a pun enjoying buffon who got an email promising that “Dovecraftian horrors await”. The thrust of said electronic mail was that the game now has a release date of this December, but it looked neat, so I doved right in. I coo-dn’t resist. I too love weird low-budget horror.

Shadows Of The Damned's Xbox 360/PS3 release may slip into either camp, depending on whether you liked it back in the day or not. It's a third-person action adventure where two famous video game folks joined forces: No More Heroes' Suda51 and Resident Evil's Shinji Mikami. And to my knowledge, it's considered a bit of a cult classic.\nSo, having played Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered after never experiencing the original, do I think it's any good? If you were a fan of the OG, there's no doubt you'll like it. If you're coming in as a newbie, I think it's refreshing in the sense it's a trim throwback with some interesting ideas and middling-to-good execution. But its whole schtick isn't only a product of its time - it's actually downright yucky.\nRead more",

It's got a pleasant upstairs-downstairs vibe.

This puzzle-solving sequel, Wilmot Works It Out, doesn't come packaged with its predecessor's wry humour, nor the same sense of compulsion. Instead, it exudes a calm and homely sense of idle comfort. For me, that ultimately makes it less compelling, even if it is thematically the entire point. This is about a warehouse worker doing jigsaws on his day off.\nRead more",

In case you're unfamiliar, Denuvo's wares have become infamous for allegedly sabotaging the performance of all sorts of video games, from Resident Evil: Village to Tekken 7, though accounts of the severity vary, and there is an on-going shortage of independently supplied raw data. \nDenuvo's attempts to clear the air include opening a Discord, which they say “ is a key step in fostering closer relationships with game developers, publishers, and players, offering a dynamic, real-time platform for meaningful interaction”. On Monday, Denuvo’s media team reached out to me to offer an interview with Denuvo’s product manager, Andreas Ullmann. Here’s that interview, edited for brevity. \nRPS: In a recent public statement you said “we will stop letting every claim about our product go unanswered\". What claims are you referring to?\nAndreas Ullmann: It's basically really about the stuff that's posted by the community. So you just need to check out Steam forums, for example. Very toxic, very hostile environment. If a game announces to use any of our products, if you check out the Steam forums, all the claims are popping in. SSDs are destroyed by our solution. The usual performance topics, and we simply don't want to leave the floor to these people who are posting all things about us anymore. We want to also be there for a person who has not heard about us before. We also want to share our view, our opinion on these topics, and also act as a trusted source of information.\nRead more",

At least, I think he's an odd flag-bearer for a series of games where you live out a nostalgic, Japanese summer in the countryside.\nAnd I think it's doubly weird that Shin chan: Shiro And The Coal Town opts for a collectathon approach, that doesn't necessarily make the act of living out a Cicada Summer all that mesmerising. But, and this is a big but: I can't stop thinking about it. Of all the games of 2024, Coal Town may have left the biggest impression on me. In a way, I hope it does for you, too.\nRead more",

You're a kid who's playing a legendary 8-bit game that's said to be possessed by evil spirits. The experience sees you alternating between the surprisingly labyrinthine space of the game, and the increasingly threatening environment of your bedroom, where terrible toys abound.

But those that do tend to complain they couldn’t get the hang of the controls. You can understand why. Try to strafe left to dodge an attack from a blubber monster, and you’ll instead rotate on the spot. Attempt to turn the camera with a flick of the mouse, and you’ll discover that your view remains fixed in place - the cursor moving across the screen as if searching for an icon on your desktop.\n\"The controls are actually one of the biggest points that make people bounce off the game,\" developer Raphael Bossniak admits.\nAnd yet they’re also a unique selling point. Where last year’s extraordinary System Shock remake embraced the interface and keyboard conventions of modern gaming, Sonar Shock leans into the experimentation of pre-Quake control schemes - long before WASD and mouselook became standardised for the sake of ease and sanity.\nRead more",

It'll cost $30 on Steam, Itch, and GOG.   \r\n\r\nOriginal story: The Caves Of Qud developer has posted a cryptic riddle that sounds a bit like a release date in disguise. A post on the game's Steam page yesterday reads: \"{n} purple wardens beseech the Chair, What is death, if one rose is fair? How long from beetle moon to beetle moon?\" That means absolutely nothing to me. But at least one fan in the comments knows their lore enough to have translated it, resulting in a specific date later this year. If their solution is correct, this could be a characteristically cryptic way for developer Freehold Games to announce the date for the roguelike's 1.0 release. So, let's double check those numbers.\n Read more",

Some say that Factorio gave that genre life, though I'd point at Dwarf Fortress as one among many notable forebears. Today, the terrain of factory simming is hotly contested by rival piles of conveyor belt spaghetti. I'm not just talking about Satisfactory or Shapez - they're even making philosophical factory sims these days. They have cosy factory sims now.\nAccordingly, the immense, smoke-rimmed cyborg eye of Factorio has turned from the exhausted soil to the relatively untapped heavens. Somewhere up there, there is unspoilt territory. Somewhere, there is land that has never known the roar of a smelter - and in Factorio's behemothic Space Age DLC, out today, you will find it.\n Read more",

Now, imagine a faint scuttling behind the skirting boards. A rattling in the pipes. Was there a toilet in Gone Home's autumnal mansion? I can't recall, but you should probably steer clear.\r\n \nRead more",

Edders had a dream, the dream of Halo Infinite getting a battle royale mode. Like Moses descending from the mount with a Needler in either hand, he bedazzled and amazed us with visions of \"an enormous playground stitched together from some of Halo's most iconic maps of yore; Warthogs and Mongooses roaming the lands; players racing to the M41 SPNKR as it spawns; grappling to a rooftop and laying down covering fire; some contrived reason as to why there's a circle of poison gas closing in... but hey, rings are what Halo does best, right? It's 100% doable.\"\nEd Thorn has always been a journalist of great sagacity and supernatural insight, so it was of no surprise to the RPS editors of the era when rumours bubbled up a few months later that Certain Affinity had partnered with 343 Industries (nowadays Halo Studios) to make Halo battle royale a reality. These rumours have now been confirmed by Certain Affinity's former design director Mike Clopper, who says the now-cancelled mode could have been a \"game changer\".\n Read more",

In County Of Fortune, you seed and grow a number of settlements side by side, then manage their economic and social relations.

          "description": "Archetype Entertainment and Blur Studio's space RPG Exodus was announced back in December, and was broadly notable for a couple of things: 1) Matthew McConaughey plays a character, and 2) the game's story is woven around time dilation during faster than light travel, with star-hopping adventurers prosecuting a fight against evil Celestials over hundreds, perhaps thousands of years.\nNow, it is notable for three things, the third thing being a cosmic blubber-spire of gurning faces who want to eat your ship and soul. Say hello to the Mara Yama, the ickiest Celestial faction so far. Here's a trailer, in which McConaughey does that thing where he lingers on the sibilants and makes you want to lean in and vigorously mess up his hair.\n Read more",

According to the eSports journalist Rod Breslau, he's been sent to the naughty step for a grand total of two weeks, which I'm sure will be a huge inconvenience and will really teach him the error of his ways. Assuming Breslau's sources are accurate, it's a great demonstration of Twitch's tolerance for streamers with big audiences, the kind of slap on the wrist you'd expect from a platform that recently reinstated Donald Trump's account after banning him in 2021 for the charge of inciting an insurrection.\n Read more",

The opening minutes are oddly silent, until Westkust’s Swirl blasts out from your radio as soon as you drive off toward your first destination - your mate’s house, to hang out and play console games.

Building Relationships is about buildings forming relationships in a Love Islandy scenario, though without the reality TV framing you might find in say, Crush House. But the real gag here is the commitment to the bit. Besides that, it’s just a really charming and fun N64-style 3D platformer.\nIt also features the sort wonky physics that definitely wouldn’t get Ninty’s seal of quality, but work brilliantly here, especially since your character consists largely of angles but still insists on, you know, performing motions.\nRead more",

Make it Rain might be on the more comic side of things, but it's still worth completing for a laugh. Moreover, this particular Easter Egg is one of the easiest ones to solve as long as you have the right tool.\n\n\nCall of Duty Black Ops 6 Make it Rain Easter Egg guide\n\n\nTo complete the Make it Rain Easter Egg, you'll have to travel to the Church. The side quest can be completed quickly using any weapon that does explosive damage. A launcher is an excellent choice as it does explosive damage, and you can also use the aim to target correctly. But explosives like Frag Grenade will work as well.\n\n\nStand in front of the Church and look up towards the spire on the left. If you look carefully, you'll find a zombie head resting at the top. Throw the grenade on it, or shoot using a launcher. Once the head is destroyed with explosive damage, the main job is done. Now starts the fun part.\n\n\nImage via Destructoid\n\n\nFor the next minute, zombies will hilariously fall from the sky, and it gets even better if you're surrounded by live zombies (oh the irony!). Additionally, these dead spawns can drop loots as well, which is always beneficial. The loots are random, but I have found consumables from them.\n\n\nThe Make it Rain Easter Egg is simple and easy to do, which makes it rank at the top of my list. If you're up for a more hardcore task, you can unlock the Jet Gun from the Crafting Station and use it to clear waves of massive zombies with extreme prejudice.\n\nThe post How to complete Make it Rain in Black Ops 6 (BO6 Liberty Falls Easter Egg) appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Although it's not the largest video game ever in terms of map size (not even when compared to other Elder Scrolls titles), Skyrim still boasts a hefty amount of land to explore. Its vastness gives plenty to see while out and about on (mostly) fun quests, but there's no doubt that it could stand to be a bit bigger.\n\n\nThat's where Nexus Mods user Nevah comes onto the scene. As noted by DSO Gaming, we've got an opportunity to explore a brand-new island, thanks to \"Nevah’s Isle Redux.\" Not only is there an island/world to explore, but the mod also contains a ghost village, complete with a home for the player.\n\n\nImage via Nevah/Nexus Mods.\n\n\nThe description on Nexus says to get to the island, you'll need to head to the docks at Solitude. There's also a memorandum to the creator's father at the northwest point of the island, as well as \"many secrets and hidden rooms.\"\n\n\nTo cleanse or not\n\n\nEagle-eyed readers will have spotted the word \"redux\" in the mod's title. This is because it's a redo of a previous creation. While it's pretty much the same as the older version, this time around, they've added an optional side quest that lets you restore the island/ghost village to its former glory.\n\n\nNevah strongly recommends going through with the quest, as the island is \"far more beautiful that way\" and, once restored, will have \"no more cobwebs or decay or overgrowth.\" Of course, it's entirely up to you, so if you don't mind wandering around a new island that's home to ghost vendors, that's an option as well.\n\n\nIt's also recommended to install the mod manually, with the ESP ideally at the bottom of your Skyrim loadout list. It should also work alongside any other modifications you've got installed, but, as anyone will tell you, there's always a slight risk with these things. We like to live dangerously, yeah?\n\nThe post Skyrim gets bigger with this mod that adds a new island, ghost village appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "DayZ invites players to a perilous world of quasi-realistic survival horror. The setting features cycles of day and night, with a few smaller sub-cycles of dawn and dusk separating them. DayZ is always dangerous, whether it be because of other people, the infected, or the natural perils of just trying to subsist in a harsh and uncaring environment.\n\n\nYou needn't worry much, though, as we have an explanation for the whole thing to prevent you from wasting many in-game lives while attempting to count the exact duration of these cycles.\n\n\nScreenshot via Steam\n\n\nHow long is night in Dayz\n\n\nDayZ servers can use either the real-time from the location they're at or be customized by the owner. If the owner so chooses, they can make the Night and Day last 12 hours each. That, however, is uncommon as it just wouldn't be fun to play for anyone who's not into supposed total realism. \n\n\nThe owner can set the cycle speed from 1x to 8x, in which the cycles are eight times shorter. Most servers, however, have a Night time that lasts from one to two hours\n\n\nNighttime makes everything even more difficult for players. It reduces visibility and causes the temperature to drop, two things you need to worry about even when there are no enemies nearby as health issues can easily cause you to drop dead in this game.\n\n\nThe moon might help you gain some vision, and the stars might provide you with a sense of direction. Still, without a light source such as a flashlight, you're likely to venture into the jaws of the enemy.

Whether you want a simple hand on the hip or a crossed-arms pose, you sometimes need to go all out.\n\n\nHow to get the backflip pose in Dress to Impress\n\n\nTo get the backflip pose in Dress to Impress, you would have had to claim the “One Billion Pose” Pack that came out in the Summer update of June 2024. \n\n\nDuring the time of the event, if you clicked on the 1B balloon, you would have gotten the pose along with the Split variant of it as well. The event has since concluded and the balloon is no longer obtainable for the time being, even in the shop.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nCan you get the backflip pose as a new DTI player?\n\n\nIf you just started Dress to Impress and want the pose, it’s no longer obtainable. No codes are available to get it, but hopefully in the future after additional milestones, it could be there.\n\n\nDon’t hold out on it and don’t fall for any promised methods of getting the pose. That was the only way to get it for now.\n\n\nIs the backflip pose a must-have?\n\n\nIf you do not have the backflip pose, do not worry. You can still win in shows by being creative with what you have as long as it pertains to the theme. \n\n\nPlenty of people have won by having pre-saved outfits or spending a few Robux here and there to get some additional attire. Playing freely, waiting for events, and taking on quests can get you a lot more inventory in the long run so you can finally get a podium rank.\n\nThe post How to get the Backflip pose in Dress to Impress appeared first on Destructoid.",

Since Halloween is nearby, it was expected that the new brawler would be based on the spooky theme. And just as expected, Shade is a ghost that possessed a pile of clothes. \n\n\nShades joins the Ghost Station trio along with Gus and Chuck. What’s even better is that he has an incredible 7000 HP and can travel anywhere on the map. In this article, we are going to discuss Shade’s Main Attack and Super in Brawl Stars.\n\n\nMain Attack of Shade in Brawl Stars\n\n\nImage via Supercell\n\n\nShade basically swings his arms to attack enemies in his range. In terms of stats, he can deal damage to an enemy twice in one swing, and each one of them inflicts 1600 damage. So when you do the math, he can deal a maximum of 3200 damage per swing.\n\n\nSuper of Shade in Brawl Stars\n\n\nShade can also dash when his Super is activated. During his Super, he becomes transparent and can pass through the walls. What’s so special about him is that he can basically go anywhere, float on water, pass through walls, you name it. And yes, not just pass through walls; he can also shoot through walls (a perfect spooky trait).\n\n\nAlso, Brawl Stars has also revealed his new skin called “Cinema Shade,” which you can snag for 29 gems. In this skin, he will have a red hat with a yellow body. He will also wear 3D shades on this skin.\n\nThe post Shade in Brawl Stars: Super, Main Attack, and more appeared first on Destructoid.",
