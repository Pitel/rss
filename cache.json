You naturally start pointing and clicking to solve a simple puzzle. This leads to another puzzle: Alligator PI Brok urgently exclaims, “I need to get past that door!” Before your grey matter cogs can even get a-whirring, a dialogue box tells you to press 'X' to activate Action Mode. With a good bit of Double Dragon-style – or should we say Double Crocodile-style! – button mashing, the door puzzle is “solved”. So Cowcat Games’ cards go straight onto the table: Brok the InvestiGator is a point-and-click, but sometimes you just punch stuff to smithereens. But does it have an ace up its sleeve?\nBrok is the second game to be developed and self-published by indie shop Cowcat Games. The first was Demetrios, another point-and-click adventure, first released six years earlier in 2016, which arrived on Switch in 2018. Based in a small town in the south of France, the company is a one-person operation, making this second game under their belt all the more impressive.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

One look at the gameplay in the above trailer and you will see that this title from developers YCJY is wild. Expect gory kills, crazy colours and a hefty dose of shredding rock thrown in for good measure.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

These endlessly aggressive, partially feral creatures look very similar to orcs from Lord of the Rings and have about as much characterisation. They come in a variety of forms, each with different abilities and skills to cause chaos on the battlefield, but most are relatively straightforward.

It just seemed like a fun thing to do… until I did it.” \r\n\n\r\nLaidlaw first discovered that community in the mid 90s, in the office of Valve, where Gabe Newell and team were already hard at work on Half-Life. “I’d seen bits and pieces of the levels they were working on, but as soon as I heard the name, I just got this amazing buzz,” Laidlaw says. “I could see the whole world they were aiming at somehow, and I felt it was a collective vision. This is one reason it’s so weird to me when people try to attribute authorship to me that I’ve never felt. It was all there when I got there, in embryo.”\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's a delicate art that warrants close consideration. It also warrants some good examples, which brings us to ΔV: Rings Of Saturn. Which, as it gets closer to release, I'm going to be nice to and call either Delta V or Rings Of Saturn. Even though Triangle Vee Colon Rings is more fun.\nIt's also fun, having played it, to keep up with how it’s doing in early access, not just because I'm looking forward to seeing it take off, but because its dev has spent the last few years writing delightful patch notes in the style of in-world news bulletins.\nRead more",

          "description": "One of the best things a survival game can do is make you want to share your latest experiences with your family and friends At this, Sons Of The Forest succeeds in grand fashion. Often I found myself pausing the game so I could go find my brother and tell him about the latest Big Thing that had just happened. Some of the time, it's even for the right reasons. Perhaps I'd spotted a group of cannibals adopting some startlingly intelligent behaviour. Or maybe one of my NPC companions had just done something particularly endearing in front of me.\nOr, more likely, I'd witnessed another example of the incredible jankiness which, like the island's flesh-nibbling denizens, loves to raid and pillage its way through nearly every aspect of the game. Perhaps I'd just cut down a tree and watched it soar high into the air, glitching all over the place like some demonic new type of tree mutant. Maybe Kelvin had just taken my instruction to gather logs a bit too literally, and deconstructed the entire west side of my house while I wasn't looking.\nSons Of The Forest's great strength is its ability to utterly transport you into its threatening, unsettling, but genuinely beautiful world. It quickly builds up the player's trust until they're ready to wholeheartedly buy into what at times feels like the next generation of open-world survival and crafting games. But then, at least in its current Early Access state, it breaks that trust just as quickly with a melange of unintuitive systems, game-breaking bugs, and a painful lack of content that makes one of the most gorgeous environments in games feel awfully hollow after a while.\nRead more",

That time is divided into five-second chunks during which you're shown what the enemy will do, and must use that to coordinate your own mechs, placing their orders on a visible timeline. You finish your turn by hitting a button that makes everyone go at once for a few explosive moments.\nIn practice, behind those few seconds are an eternity of theorising, testing, and tweaking. There's probably a metaphor in there somewhere about writing, video editing, or catering. The result is a game that's taken me absolutely ages, but whose numbers suggest I'm supposed to be blasting through without a care.\nI am enjoying it a lot, despite some frustration.\nRead more",

In fact, this processor is down to £177 at Amazon UK at present, meaning it's rapidly approaching half of its £329 UK RRP. \nYes, I know the CPU pictured is the 5800X. Please don't tell anyone!

A list of bugs longer than a Saturn V reads like a terrible medical diagnosis: quivering periapsis, unpredictable methane leakage, late-stage separation anxiety, loose payloads, non-stop burning, and sensitive nodes.\nThe developers, smiling bravely in circumstances presumably beyond their control, describe the launch as like dropping a kid off for their first day at school. Well the kid forgot their lunchbox, their uniform, their books and their pencil case. They showed up at the wrong school, on a Saturday during half-term. If you were stranded on a desert island and had to recreate Kerbal Space Program from memory using nothing but coconuts and string, it would look something like Kerbal Space Program 2. The game is nowhere approaching finished, it barely resembles the promotional videos, and it isn’t ready, even by Early Access standards.\nRead more",

The other two - the bulk of the game - weren't playable. Still, what I did play was simplistic fun that valued chaos over stealth, with middling results.

          "description": "Most RPGs set you off on some kind of grand quest, a hero's journey filled with danger and peril as you track down some legendary sword to defeat a world-ending evil. Boots Quest DX, however, has much humbler aspirations. You are a mere boot enthusiast on an adventure to find the very bestest best boots known to man (or blobs, I genuinely can't tell what provenance these rotund creatures hail from), and nothing else will deter you from achieving your lifelong goal. Find a honking great sword on the beach? Trash. A pirate's cutlass? Get in the sea, literally. If it's not a pair of boots, you're not interested - and it all makes for a brisk, anti-RPG adventure that's incredibly refreshing. \nRead more",

Maybe walk around on an asteroid, just because.\nSpacebourne 2 isn't the dream. But for a game made, as far as I can tell, by one person, it is an astonishing effort to capture that spirit.\nRead more",

Those that work wonderfully despite their smaller scope, and those that work wonderfully because of it. It’s that second kind - the particular and peculiar voyages into the miniature and mundane - that really spin wonders. Games like Unpacking, PowerWash Simulator, and Dinkum. Games humble enough in scope, and curious enough in outlook, to be uniquely capable of framing everyday experiences so that their inner oddness and strange magic - unfairly dulled by familiarity - shines. \r\n\n\r\nSo, when Jordon - solo dev on the upcoming Time Bandit - brings up the question: how do you want to spend your time? I’m left pondering it for far longer than I think I otherwise would, thinking about it in context. The obvious answer here is: playing an videogame, please. But Time Bandit’s free demo doesn’t take long to make me almost uncomfortably aware that there’s more than one way to play something. I don’t even need to be anywhere near the PC. I might actually be playing it more when I’m not [X-Files music, but also I’m going somewhere with this].\r\n\n \nRead more",

With an evocative depiction of its simulated industrial revolution, including some delightfully chewy production-line wrangling, Anno 1800 was a treat, and I was keen to see what the Dusseldorf-based studio would cook up next.\nThe answer, unfortunately, is a big bowl of strategy gruel. I'm not sure what has gone wrong in the last five years, but Blue Byte clearly left whatever magic Anno 1800 had in the nineteenth century. The Settlers: New Allies is a dismal strategy affair, confused, anaemic, and achingly dull.\nRead more",

And cor, I've never seen such love for individual expansions and total conversion mods among mainline RTS games and 4Xs. As with all strategy games, however, there can only be one victor - and you can find out what that single strategy game to rule them all is right here. Here are your 50 favourite strategy games of all time, as voted for by you, the RPS readership.\nRead more",

          "description": "There’s a touch of poetry to the way Wild Hearts carves so liberally from Monster Hunter. After all, Monster Hunter is a series about an unknown newcomer toppling ancient beasts, chopping up their best bits to create weapons and armour. Forget sleeves, Wild Hearts wears its inspirations as a complete set of clothing crafted from the bones, fur, and teeth of Capcom’s increasingly popular series. Inevitably these materials may feel lesser than the whole from which they were harvested, but they are worn proudly and with confidence nevertheless. \r\n\n\r\nBesides, as a rare challenger to Monster Hunter, Wild Hearts is clearly aware of the difficulties involved in trying to pull off something new. Perhaps this is why Omega Force’s monster battler is so welcoming to newcomers. Finally, here is a game that is willing to teach a player why this long-running genre is held in such high regard. Wild Hearts is the perfect entry point for anyone who has ever dreamed of being a Monster Hunter Liker. A bombastic, brilliant good time that’s held back by frequent, frustrating performance issues on PC.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "You know it’s a great turn in The Pale Beyond when only five of your crew are freezing, two have frostbite, and one has scurvy. After all the struggles and dangers I’ve been through trying to keep my ship’s crew alive in the bone-biting cold of the arctic tundra, that’s definitely a success in my book.\nIt’s easy to describe Bellular Studio’s survival sim as just ‘Frostpunk on a ship’, but in some ways that’s pretty accurate: you’re the leader of a group trying to survive in a harsh frozen wasteland. But it’s also a comparison that falls short in plenty of other ways. Sure, the engine of this survival sim might run the same as Frostpunk’s, but it’s buried deep in a handcrafted hull. With an overarching story that deals with the drama and despair of survival, together with a cast of underdog characters whose personalities and flaws fuel your determination to keep them alive, The Pale Beyond is much more human than its steampunk counterpart.\nRead more",

          "description": "After the mud and forests of Normandy, and the grim, snowy climes of the Eastern Front, Company Of Heroes 3 feels like World War II on its summer holiday. With two campaigns spanning each side of the sunny Mediterranean, this is arguably Relic's breeziest and most colourful theatre of war yet, evoking the same kind of swagger and gung ho optimism as a Hollywood action flick. It's a feeling that might seem out of place given the current climate, especially now, just days away from the first anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But while your main objective is always one of domination, gradually turning the map from red to blue on both a micro and macro scale, this is ultimately a game about searing comebacks - of beating back seemingly impossible aggressors, and finding hope where previously there was only despair. I think we could all do with a bit of that in this day and age, even if the battles before you end up feeling like nothing more than the digital equivalent of plonking down a big box of toy soldiers on your living room floor and going daka-daka-daka as they all fall over. \nRead more",

From the look of the screenshots, I was expecting a creepy story in the vein of Little Misfortune or Fran Bow, but instead Birth is infinitely more introspective. Sure, it’s a game about death, decay, and loneliness, but it’s told in the most gentle and genuine way possible. Its themes are heavy, but the game could not be more light-hearted. I have no idea how it does it, but Birth is weirdly the most wholesome yet creepy game I've ever played.\nRead more",

          "description": "Probe the rich\nPurveyor of (often romantic) visual novels, Winter Wolves, has launched a Kickstarter for their latest concoction, Save the World. They are seeking €4000 for the project, and… oh, they already met it. Good for them.\nSave the World appears to be a yuri visual novel. The Kickstarter doesn’t explicitly say that, but all I see are women, and the two mentioned romantic options are both lesbian. It involves one such woman being abducted by aliens. Their leader, Xen, explains that they aren’t invaders, but rather they travel about saving worlds and asks for the protagonist, Ekiya’s, advice on what’s ailing Earth. Her response is about the unbalanced distribution of wealth, and the aliens follow through by simply eliminating a lot of rich people.\nBoobs and eating the rich. I am captivated.\n[embed]https://youtu.be/jz4oi9nFJVc[/embed]\nI find the narrative crux of Save the World to be quite interesting. It has you consider if, given the opportunity, you would use an alien race's technological force to address the world’s problems. How far would you go? Would it even be worth it? Maybe the world’s problems are humanity’s alone to fix, or perhaps a drastic — possibly violent — course correction is the only way to save it.\nMeanwhile, you also have the option to romance two of the characters. Because there’s no better way to unwind from a moral quandary than with a little grind and bump. Stretch goals include more CG scenes and extra outfits, some of which are sexy or completely explicit (another kind of sexy).\nI’ve enjoyed a fair few of Winter Wolves’ previous visual novels, but with this sort of thing, it mostly comes down to the writer and artist.\nSave the World’s Kickstarter is going on right now and will continue through to March 23, 2023. The development is expected to take one year, with Save the Earth becoming available on PC in March 2024.\nThe post Winter Wolves launches Kickstarter for new visual novel Save the World appeared first on Destructoid.",

It is free for all owners of The DioField Chronicle, so no need to purchase a separate piece of DLC either.\nhttps://twitter.com/DiofieldGame/status/1630893162976751618\nThis update includes a new story scenario, dubbed \"Waltaquin's Story.\" For those who have already played through the game, you can imagine how venturing into Waltaquin's side might be interesting to see.\nAdditionally, the update is adding a Very Hard difficulty and Extra Mode difficulty, the latter for New Game+ mode. Also, a new weapon type for Magic Tomes is being added as well. Hopefully, that includes some new abilities and skills for users of Tomes.\nYou'll need to reach chapter 6 to access all of this, it seems. Story reasons are one thing, but it will probably also help to be familiar with The DioField Chronicle before tackling some of its newer challenges too.\nA new chapter\nOf the many, many RPGs that Square Enix released last fall, The DioField Chronicle is an odd one. But there's something about its fresh take on strategy and interesting world that's kept it in my mind, months after rolling credits.\nSo yes, I'm happy to see this game getting a free update and some post-launch additions. Waltaquin's side of the story felt like it was left hanging for future potential, and I'm curious to see where it goes, and if any of this hints at a follow-up. I'd certainly like to see The DioField Chronicle carry forward into another entry.\nThe free update for The DioField Chronicle arrives on March 5.\nThe post The DioField Chronicle is getting a free update with new story and more appeared first on Destructoid.",

The big twist here is that all the bells and whistles have been sliced off in favor of more simplistic visuals that bring to mind the type of flowcharts you’d find in your employee training manual or in boardroom presentations. Pushing to further the minimalistic approach, there is no punishment for not getting things exactly right.\n[embed]https://youtu.be/G567j3fp1TE[/embed]\nSome people really love making flowcharts, but there isn’t always a need for them. Masterplan Tycoon sort of feels like a solution to this. It provides abundant need for flowcharts, which should be exceedingly satisfying for the flowchart minded.\nI feel like the minimalistic graphics style has to make it extraordinarily difficult for a small project to stand out, however. Video games are often about piling gloss and hanging ornaments from very simple abstractions. It’s always an interesting experiment to remove those dressings to reveal the naked skeleton beneath. A lot of the most addictive games have stripped the unnecessary fat, and instead replaced it with the constant feeling of progression.

It follows the story of the Warrior of Chaos, Cyan, who is fated to do battle with his counterpart, the Warrior of Order.

The vacancy, which went live yesterday, was spotted by the news outlet GameRant.\nWhile there are no clues as to whether the project is a straight sequel, a remaster, or some form of spin-off, The Coalition is looking for applicants with experience in \"3CS\", (Character, Camera, Controls), which certainly suggests an over-the-shoulder third-person affair. The job listing coincides with recent rumors that the studio had been pushed to can two unannounced games purely to focus on the lucrative and hugely popular shooter franchise.\nhttps://twitter.com/IdleSloth84_/status/1621186685873651712?s=20\nGiant Bomb writer Jeff Grubb has previously suggested that the next title from The Coalition will be Gears 6, which will be the first sequel since the release of Gears 5, which launched on PC and Xbox platforms in the fall of 2019.\n\"This was all reflected in the layoffs that happened at Microsoft, which did hit The Coalition a little bit,\" said Grubb on the Game Mess Mornings Show. \"The studio is now going to move on fully to Gears 6. I say now, it has likely moved on to Gears 6 in full over the course of the last year, but, definitely, that will be their next game.\"\nStill, regardless of whatever title The Coalition has on deck, it is clearly still in its early production stages.

Well, the Verified system is a way for Valve to acknowledge which games are most compatible with its computer handheld, the Steam Deck. While many games can run, not all of them will run well. Some might have some issues with controller support, or new hitches introduced when trying to operate on the Deck.\nVerified acknowledges that a game passes a certain set of standards, as outlined by Valve. This includes controller support, performance, appropriate input icons, and legible text on the in-game interface.\nSo while many Edgerunners might have already been tinkering around with Cyberpunk 2077 on Valve's handheld device, the game is now officially approved for the Steam Deck.\nhttps://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1630599572840906759\nA new cyber deck\nThis guarantee of decent operation makes it a little bit easier for those who don't want to fool around with settings and options to simply play a game on their Steam Deck. It's a pretty good upside for anyone wanting to reacquaint themselves ahead of a possible expansion release this year, too.\nWhile Cyberpunk 2077 got the Steam Deck treatment, though, older games in CD Projekt's back catalog aren't so lucky. This marks the third of CD Projekt's games to become Steam Deck Verified, alongside The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales. In today's announcement, though,  CD Projekt says there is no plan to provide additional Steam Deck optimizations for \"our legacy titles.\" Sad to say, I think this knocks out any Assassins of Kings hopes. But at least the Edgerunners know they can safely plug into a Steam Deck run of Cyberpunk 2077 now.\nThe post Cyberpunk 2077 is now officially Verified for Steam Deck appeared first on Destructoid.",

Available as Forklift Extreme: Deluxe Edition, this is the first time the title has become available on a platform aside from the Switch and mobile.\nIf the name didn’t give it away, Forklift Extreme is a physics-based forklift simulator. Using “ultra-realistic physics” to bring this favored pastime to life, you can finally live out your dreams as a person who moves things with a vehicle. Or, as the press release puts it, “lifelike driver physics for an immersive experience like never before.” Okay!\n[caption id=\"attachment_366251\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Last Man Gaming[/caption]\nThe Forklift Extreme: Deluxe Edition includes all the game’s DLC. There’s one where you move furniture and another with giant pumpkins. That’s cool. Pumpkins are cool.\nReal talk, though. The press release email opened with the one-person developer saying they’re just a “big fan of physics simulation games.” You know what? I’m a big fan of programmer-driven games. Reviews of the Switch version aren’t bad but aren’t spectacular, but maybe the package is a lot more enticing with all the DLC included. The critics at least seem to agree that it’s exactly what it says on the box.\nI was driven to write about this because my dad is a yard foreman at a lumberyard in my hometown. A big part of his job is driving a forklift. I wonder if there’s an option in Forklift Extreme for racing wheels, because I’d love to see how he would do in a series of challenges like this.\nForklift Extreme is available on Switch, iOS, and Android.

The game gives some mad Breath of the Wild smells, but it looks to differentiate itself by providing some home-building mechanics and two-player co-op. The developer is also touting a “Hollywood screenwriter” and the voice actress who lent her cords to Princess Zelda in Breath of the Wild.\n[embed]https://youtu.be/j7DmJuYzD3Q[/embed]\nI’m a bit of a fan of Apogee’s reinvention of itself. Utilizing its name recognition for publishing small and independent titles feels a bit like a return to the company’s original manifesto. I doubt we’ll be getting a rebirth of shareware, however.\nWith that said, while Elements definitely has a charming look to it, I think I’m hitting my tolerance limit for open-world games. It’s a genre that grows and grows as the years go on but still somehow stays exactly the same.\nNevertheless, the people have spoken, and the Kickstarter campaign sits at around $200,000 Canadian Loonies as of writing. The campaign runs until Friday, March 3, 2023, at 6:00 PM PST, so there’s still a bit of time to nab a tier if this all looks interesting.\nIf not, Elements will hit Steam Early Access in Q2 2024.

          "description": "Devils and angel wings\nBandai Namco dropped a new trailer for Tekken 8 this morning, spotlighting another key character in the universe, Jin Kazama. The latest Tekken 8 teaser is all about the longtime series lead and his moves, both new and old.\nAs Jin says in his new character trailer, \"strength isn't everything.\" But he is looking pretty dang strong in the Tekken 8 engine. It looks like Jin is incorporating his devil powers within his usual fighting style for some devastating hits.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkJQZ2Cz9-s\nIt's an interesting look for Jin that looks even better in the Tekken 8 arena. Tekken has usually impressed with its graphics, and that's held true for everything we've seen so far of the next entry in the series. Everything from the electric punches and slow-motion zoom-ins to Jin's best \"One-Winged Angel\" pose looks fantastic already.\nFist meets fate\nBandai has been drip-feeding out more and more characters from Tekken 8, though we've mostly seen the usual suspects. Trailers have spotlighted other mainstays like Kazuya Mishima and Nina Williams.\nStill, even the familiar can be exciting when it looks as solid as Tekken 8 does. It's hard to get a gameplay gauge just from video, but it's looking like the next year or so could be a big one for fighting games. Street Fighter 6 is on the horizon, Project L is in development, and apparently Mortal Kombat 12 is happening too.\nTekken 8 still doesn't have a firm launch locked in, but it could be quite a time for fans of virtual scrappin' as all these new combatants enter the ring.\nThe post Jin Kazama unleashes the devil in latest Tekken 8 trailer appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Destiny expansions are usually a decent \"all day\" affair\nDestiny 2: Lightfall is out today, and the community is already buzzing with the ever-present question of every game release: \"did you take off work for it?\" Well, I'm playing it for work, does that count?\nOne of the last \"take off of work\" stories I can recall before I got into this gig full-time is Skyrim. I picked it up at a midnight launch Thursday night (early RIP for GameStop), took off that Friday, and played it through Saturday evening; which is when I cleared the main quest (yep!). I spent the rest of the weekend mucking around. There's nothing like a cozy atmosphere, fun food, and embedding yourself in an open world game. But back to Destiny.\nDestiny is a breezy series if you're playing it casually\nHaving covered Destiny since the original game's alpha period, I'm no stranger to \"taking off\" (so to speak!) for these launches. The thing is, even if you're a casual player, most modern Destiny expansions have around a full day's worth of raw content to them. After that it's generally off to the gear grind, prepping for the raid, potentially doing some dungeon runs or Crucible PVP, and waiting for updates. But you can get the overall \"gist\" of the base expansion very quickly, and I'm sure a lot of folks are going to be doing just that with Lightfall today. Not a bad way to spend a Tuesday.\nWeirdly, these kinds of live service games have a meta that typically involves gearing up as quickly as you can, and constantly running the toughest content so you can always be above the curve. So seeing players take off an entire week hasn't been out of the question. Either way, we're curious if you still take off work for games!\nThe post Do you still take off work/school to play games?

          "description": "A new fantasy IP from the ground-up\nIO Interactive forged a name for itself through its Hitman series, but today it's announced a different kind of project altogether. The studio making an online fantasy RPG.\nAnnounced in a blog post today, IO Interactive is building a new world and IP for an online fantasy RPG. It's built \"from the core\" to be around for years to come. And as IO describes it, it feels familiar, yet is unlike anything the company's done before now.\nThere are some touchstones mentioned in the blog post, ranging from Fighting Fantasy books that offered choose-your-journey opportunities to gathering around a tabletop. Heck, even being a game master.\n\"This idea – that a diverse group of individuals with different skills and strengths can work together and become more than the sum of their parts – is what inspires us,\" IO said in its announcement. \"It inspires the fantasy world we are building – and it inspires how we build it. IOI now spans multiple distinct studios, from Copenhagen and Malmö in the north to warm Barcelona in the south. All studios take part in making all our games, including this new endeavor. People from all over the world with diverse personalities and skillsets are coming together to forge a new beginning.\"\nStarting off on a new journey\nNot many more details were shared, beyond the lone art teaser and blog post. It's currently code-named Project Fantasy, and IO is actively hiring for it.\nIO Interactive has been building out the World of Assassination they started with the Hitman reboot, and are also working on a James Bond game, too. This online fantasy RPG adds another to the docket for the company, but I'm pretty keen on seeing what it turns out to be. IO's breakaway with the Hitman series turned out incredibly well, and I'd love to see what the crew does with an RPG setting. And, of course, whether Agent 47 is quietly lurking in the background.

          "description": "I really, really miss Sheva\nHere's an odd but not unwelcome occurrence, Capcom has quietly updated the Steam/PC edition of its survival horror sequel Resident Evil 5. The new patch, now available to download on the Steam platform, adds split-screen local co-op, removes Games for Windows Live, and stomps a few bugs.\nOriginally released in 2009, Resident Evil 5 saw former S.T.A.R.S. operative Chris Redfield head out to West Africa, investigating a potential Bio-Organic weapon sale, led by terrorist Ricard Irving. Teamed with BSAA operative Sheva Alomar, the duo soon find that this case goes far deeper than mere weapons sales, and will bring Chris face-to-face with some welcome, and very unwelcome, faces from the past.\nHe also punches a boulder to death.\nThis Steam update is a long, long time coming, and the removal of Games for Windows Live support eliminates a frustrating hurdle in playing the game. Of course, the Resident Evil series has long moved forward from its heady, tank-controlled, RE5 days, but for those who still enjoy running through the entire franchise with pals, then this new update contemporizes the release for future efforts.\nNow, if we can just see to giving Sheva her grand franchise return, that'd be just peachy.\nThe post Resident Evil 5 for Steam updated with split-screen co-op appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Stay out of Davey Jones' locker\nGet ready to moisten your diving gear, as Camel 101 has given us a peak at their upcoming FPS horror title, Beneath. Beneath bills itself as an “action-horror adventure” and is coming to PC, followed by Xbox Series X|S and PS5.\nPlaying as deep-sea diver Noah Quinn, you stumble across an underwater research facility in the ocean's murky depths. I’d really be interested in seeing a game about a research facility that is just operating without issue and maybe just developing flavors of drink mix, but of course, this one is infested with monsters. Actually, why not both? Why can’t it be a drink mix R&D facility that has an outbreak of dangerously delicious monsters?\n[embed]https://youtu.be/qrHElrB5J5k[/embed]\nIn any case, Beneath will have you plumbing the oceans and uncovering the mystery of this facility while trading gunfire with foes and various unspeakable beasts. Beneath touts resource management where guns are plentiful, but ammunition is not. Combat is appropriately tactical, and sanity is short, as you’ll need to keep your sanity meter topped up. You’ll also spend some time exploring the facility's interior and exterior.\nI like the creepy aesthetic. It reminds me of the episode of the X-Files, Død Kalm. The nautical utilitarianism and oppressive shadows provide an isolating effect. Developers seem to have discovered the horror potential of ocean settings, so Beneath is going to have to work to stand out, but the initial trailer seems promising.\nBeneath is headed to PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5.

          "description": "My day is ruined\nIf you are like me, you have taken small comfort in Chris Carter’s reliable coverage of the event Pokemon that can lay eggs in Pokemon Scarlet & Violet. Whether it’s Charmander or Froakie, the inclusion of baby Pokemon has been a nice bonus for the past 7-Star Tera Raid encounters. However, while the new 5-Star Walking Wake and Iron Leaves encounters have otherwise followed the rules of 7-Star raids, there is one crucial exception.\nI am sad to report that, no, neither Walking Wake nor Iron Leaves are capable of laying eggs. Trust me, I tried everything. I got the perfect Ditto, I made an egg power sandwich, I even played \"My Heart Will Go On.\" Neither Paradox Pokemon would make as much as a passing glance at a potential companion. To answer your follow-up question, yes it was the DragonForce cover of \"My Heart Will Go On.\" Of course I used the most romantic version, do you think I’m crazy?\n[caption id=\"attachment_366036\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot by Destructoid[/caption]\nThis shouldn’t be a terribly big surprise. Paradox Pokemon can’t lay eggs, so your only option for duplicate Paradox monsters is to catch them yourself. That’s a bit harder with Walking Wake and Iron Leaves, as you can only catch one of each while their respective challenge is live. Since the event info does stipulate that these monsters “may be… obtainable through other methods,” it’s possible they will appear more commonly in future DLC. For now, keep your catches of Walking Wake and Iron Leaves safe.

The world’s five explorable regions – Kehjistan, Scosglen, Fractured Peaks, Dry Steppes, and Hawezar – offer their own flavors of topography, cultures, quests, and, of course, monsters. Blizzard is going to great lengths to ensure these regions are not only fun for players to explore, but feature more narrative cohesion and a stronger sense of place. \nDiablo veterans have explored regions of Sanctuary before, but this time they’re more than one-note areas highlighting a single climate or element, such as snow or desert. Each of them is biodiverse in its own right, with multiple biomes and threats exclusive to them. These realms also blend more naturally together; the lush green of one area gradually withers…",

The publication reports that its three sources were able to confirm the news, which began making rounds on Twitter when both current and former QA testers at the Lousiana office began to share what they had learned. \nEA just fired its entire Baton Rouge studio, which is essentially their entire Apex Legends QA staff.\nFebruary 28, 2023\nKotaku reports that around 8 a.m. CT, QA testers were invited to an unscheduled but mandatory Zoom call with Magnit Global, which is the contract agency that manages the workers. It was during this meeting that the entire QA team at the Lousiana office was \"disbanded,\" according to Kotaku. \nThe publication reached out to EA looking for a response to the mass layoffs, but the publisher opted not to directly address it, instead stating that as \"part of its ongoing global strategy, we are expanding the distribution of our Apex Legends testing team and ending execution that's been concentrated in Baton Rouge, Lousiana, impacting services provided by our third-party provider.\" Be sure to check out Kotaku's write-up for the full statement from EA and additional context surrounding the layoffs, the Lousiana office, and more. \n[Source: Kotaku]",

It’s easily the farthest a mainline Final Fantasy game has ever been from its traditional turn-based roots, with FFXVI being easily the most action-heavy yet. That’s not surprising, though, considering the game’s combat director is Ryota Suzuki, a former Capcom developer with nearly 20 years of experience designing the action in games like Marvel vs. Capcom 2, Devil May Cry 4, and most recently, Devil May Cry 5. \nWith such a personal connection to Devil May Cry, I couldn’t resist asking: Who would win in a one-on-one fight: FFXVI protagonist Clive or Devil May Cry 5 lead Dante? Suzuki had to answer this question with two of his bosses right beside him – FFXVI director Hiroshi Takai and producer Naoki Yoshida – so perhaps we should take this answer with a grain of salt. But I don’t know, having played both Devil May Cry 5 and two hours of FFXVI during a recent hands-on preview (read about that here), I’m inclined to believe him. \nHis answer, with a sly smile and a laugh: Clive. \nSuzuki says Clive’s Eikonic abilities, which allow him to tap into the power of Eikons like Phoenix and Titan, give him the ultimate edge. And just for fun, I asked who would win in a fight between Clive and Nero. \n“Clive.” \nThere you have it, very specific fans of both Final Fantasy and Devil May Cry 5 like me; Clive wins.",

A special few in the world of FFXVI are Dominants, meaning they can tap into the power of an Eikon and even transform into them. Cidolfus, for example, can become the Ramuh Eikon. Clive, however, is not a Domin…",

          "description": "Following the release of Forspoken earlier this year, Square Enix has announced that the game's developer, Luminous Productions, will merge into the company. \nIt's a strange announcement, given that Luminous Productions was already a studio under the Square Enix umbrella. But now, it seems that Luminous Productions as an individual entity will be no more and, thus, won't be seeing its name appear on future titles.\n\"The merger is part of the Company's efforts to bolster the competitive prowess of the Group's development studios, a goal set forth under its current medium-term business strategy,\" a press release reads. \"Square Enix has developed numerous AAA high-definition (HD) games and possesses a wealth of intellectual property (IP) and content. Luminous Productions Co., Ltd. is meanwhile equipped not only with AAA title development capabilities but also technical expertise in areas such as game engine development. Combining the two entities will further enhance the Group's ability to develop HD games.\" \nAs you can see, it's not that Luminous Productions' developers are no longer with Square Enix; it's just that the team has been merged into the wider Square Enix umbrella. As for why remains unclear. Perhaps it's the result of Forspoken's mixed reception at release, but that's speculation. \nFor more, read Game Informer's Forspoken review. \nDid you play Forspoken?

This comes in the wake of a recent report stating the three console makers plan to skip the annual event entirely this year. Sony and Microsoft have yet to confirm any formal attendance. \nIn a statement to IGN, Nintendo say E3 didn’t fit into its plans but will continue to support the event alongside its organizer, the ESA. \n\"We approach our involvement in any event on a case-by-case basis and are always considering various ways to engage with our fans. Since this year’s E3 show didn’t fit into our plans, we have made the decision to not participate. However, we have been and continue to be a strong supporter of the ESA and E3.\"\nAlthough Nintendo was the first of the three console makers to stop holding live E3 press conferences in favor of pre-recorded Direct videos, it was also the last one to have a booth on the show floor. Up until the last traditional show in 2019, Nintendo still had a large, often elaborate area filled with demos and a stage where it broadcasted its Treehouse Live stream. Xbox moved its booth out of the convention center to the Microsoft Theater next door in 2018 (though it was still part of E3); PlayStation pulled out of the event entirely in 2019 and hasn't returned. \nE3 2023 is being organized by ReedPop, the company responsible for overseeing PAX and Star Wars Celebration. It will be the first in-person show since the 2019 edition and only the second to take place since the COVID-19 pandemic started (the 2020 and 2022 shows were completely canceled, while 2021 was a virtual event). E3 runs from June 13-16 at the Los Angeles Convention Center and will have dedicated attendance days for industry and fans. The show has no exhibitor list yet, but Ubisoft recently confirmed it will attend E3 if it happens. Xbox head Phil Spencer has expressed support for E3's success but also alluded to Microsoft holding a separate event around the same time in Los Angeles. \n[Source: IGN]",

          "description": "Today’s Sony State of Play included a new trailer for Street Fighter 6, which served to introduce three characters joining the roster – the last ones we should expect to join the launch game line-up.\nThe arrival of Zangief, the professional wrestler, comes as little surprise, since he’s been a part of the line-up for so long. He holds onto old standby moves like his Screw Piledriver, but gets some new moves on display in the trailer, like the Tundra Storm counter throw.\nLikewise, it seemed only a matter of time before Cammy was revealed. We learned that the Heavy version of three of her signature moves – the Spiral Arrow, Cannon Spike, and Hooligan Combination – are being enhanced to “allow a delay which results in altered properties for some big damage,” according to a press release that went out concurrent with the trailer.\nLily is the one new addition to the fighting roster. She’s a descendant of the Thunderfoot tribe, the same cultural group that produced T. Hawk, a fighter who appeared in Super Street Fighter II. Lily’s a smaller fighter who appears to regularly speak to the spirits of nature. Her moveset includes titles like Condor Dive, Condor Spire, and Tomahawk Buster, and she pulls out war clubs to inflict damage in her attacks.\nStreet Fighter 6 is headed for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, and PC on June 2.",

Okay, the trailer is below. There's a lot more I didn't type out because you aren't reading this, and I do not blame you. Have fun, friends.

If the trailer is any indication, we’re heading into a pretty bleak moment for the characters we’ve been following in this universe since 2014. Across the course of the trailer, we see the approach of The Witness, as it methodically seems to tear through Earth’s defenses and demoralize its defenders.\nIt’s no surprise that things are looking especially dire. In the long-running storyline of the Desinty universe, Lightfall is set to be the penultimate storytelling chapter of the current saga, ahead of next year’s The Final Shape. It won’t be a tremendous surprise if the events of Lightfall set up a seemingly insurmountable dilemma for humanity that can only be resolved with the story arc’s conclusion next year.\nWe won’t have long to wait to see the scope and direction of Lightfall’s narrative; the expansion is set to release next week, on February 28.",

          "description": "Tango Gameworks’ founder Shinji Mikami is departing the studio in the coming months after a 12-year tenure. The news was first broken by TrueAchievements, who received and verified a company-wide email to ZeniMax staff announcing the departure before Bethesda publicly confirmed the news on Twitter.\nBethesda’s statement, posted below, doesn't cite a reason or a departure date but thanks Mikami for his tenure at the studio: \nMikami is credited as the creator of Resident Evil, directing several entries during his long tenure at Capcom, where he also worked on titles such as Dino Crisis, Devil May Cry, and Phoenix Wright. Mikami co-founded Capcom’s Clover Studio in 2004, the team behind Okami, Viewtiful Joe, and God Hand (which he directed), but he departed the publisher after Clover’s closure in 2007. He and former Clover leads would establish Platinum Games later that year, where he directed Vanquish. After leaving Platinum, Mikami founded Tango Gameworks in 2010, which was acquired by ZeniMax the same year. He directed the studio’s first title, The Evil Within, and served as executive producer on its sequel and Tango’s subsequent games, Ghostwire: Tokyo and this year’s Hi-Fi Rush.\nIt's unclear what Mikami will do next, but he's leaving Tango in a good place for the future. Hi-Fi Rush, the colorful musical action game that surprise launched in late January, was spearheaded by John Johanas, director of The Evil Within 2, and a team of younger designers. It had perhaps the strongest critical reception of Tango's portfolio thus far, with some calling it an early Game of the Year contender (here's our positive review). Mikami has seemingly done a good job fostering fresh talent and new ideas at Tango before his departure, and we're excited to see what's next for the veteran designer.",

The game comes from Azure Strike Gunvolt developer Inti Creates and stars two demon-slaying sisters who must scale a monster-laden castle to rescue their high-school from destruction.\nEach sister sports a unique playstyle. Shinobu fires a gun making her suited for long-ranged attacks, while Maya cuts down targets with close-ranged melee assaults. The game features two-player co-op, but playing alone lets you swap between sisters on-the-fly, each with their own health bar. This creates a unique form of strategy that we showcase in our gameplay footage below. Watch Marcus Stewart and Wesley LeBlanc explore Grim Guardian: Demon Purge's fiendish offerings to find out if it has the potential to be a worthy Castlevania successor. \n\n\nFor more previews and discussions of some of the biggest games of 2023 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for NGTs about Atomic Heart, Metroid Prime Remastered, WWE 2K23, SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake, Tchia, Persona 3 Portable, and more.",

There's not too much to glean from the video, but it does feature the main theme from Pokémon Red and Blue. Since the reveal earlier this month that Game Boy and Game Boy Advance games are playable on Switch via Nintendo Switch Online, fans have speculated that older Pokémon games like Red, Blue, Yellow, Gold, Silver, Crystal, and even Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald could appear on the service one day. Perhaps that's an announcement we'll be getting this Sunday. \nThe next #PokemonPresents is on the way, Trainers! 🤩\n#PokemonDay 2023! 🎉\nhttps://t.co/Xo6KYjvSdj pic.twitter.com/FFrmk8a5z8\nFebruary 21, 2023\nWith the presentation lasting 20 minutes, there's plenty of time for an announcement like that and more. And in recent years, the Pokémon Day direct-style presentation has been quite stellar. Last year during the Pokémon Day stream, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet were announced alongside a big Pokémon Legends: Arceus update, a Pokémon Brillaint Diamond and Shining Pearl mystery gift (Shaymin), the Alola update for Pokémon GO, and other announcements for games like Pokémon Unite, Pokémon Masters EX, and Pokémon Cafe Remix. The Pokémon Company event announced a new online anime, too. \nOnly time will tell if this year's Presents features as many exciting announcements. Fortunately, we don't have to wait long because Pokémon Day is Monday, February 27. The Pokémon Presents begins at 6 a.m. PT/9 a.m. ET and will run about 20 minutes. \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer's Pokémon Scarlet and Violet review and then read our review of Pokémon Legends: Arceus. \nWhat do you hope to see announced during this Pokémon Presents?

However, Microsoft has had a bit of a rough go at it. To counter, though, the company has been proactive in attempting to get the greenlight from the FTC, going as far as promising PlayStation that Call of Duty games will continue to come to Sony's consoles and agreeing to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo hardware. \nNow, Microsoft president and vice chair Brad Smith has announced on Twitter that Microsoft has formally signed a legally binding 10-year agreement with Nintendo to bring Call of Duty games to Nintendo players. Here's the statement Smith released on behalf of Microsoft, in full: \nWe’ve now signed a binding 10-year contract to bring Xbox games to Nintendo’s gamers. This is just part of our commitment to bring Xbox games and Activision titles like Call of Duty to more players on more platforms. pic.twitter.com/JmO0hzw1BO\nFebruary 21, 2023\nMany have already begun to speculate how Activision Blizzard will bring Call of Duty games to Nintendo consoles, which are traditionally much less powerful than current-gen Xbox and PlayStation consoles, with \"full feature and content parity.\" \nIf I had to guess, Call of Duty will likely go the route of cloud gaming seen on the Switch, unless Nintendo's next console is set to be a significantly more powerful piece of hardware. Only time will tell. \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer's thoughts on the latest Call of Duty in our Modern Warfare II review. \nDo you think bringing Call of Duty to Nintendo platforms is a big deal?

          "description": "A few months have passed since we released ScummVM 2.6.1. It's time to prepare for a new release!\nOur lovely developers added support, yet again, for a bunch of new ancient games that require testing:\nSoldier Boyz\nGLK Scott Adams Interactive Fiction games (C64 and ZX Spectrum)\nGLK Scott Adams adventures 1-12 (TI99/4A format)\nObsidian\nPink Panther: Passport to Peril\nPink Panther: Hokus Pokus Pink\nDriller/Space Station Oblivion\nHalls of the Dead: Faery Tale Adventure II\nBesides these games, we’d appreciate it if you could check our release testing list. Maybe you’ll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long - otherwise, there are some demos of these games available on our website.\nAnd since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we’ve seen notable changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.\nAs usual, we are not just adding support for new games. We are constantly working on improving the engines we already support and, in particular, we’ve seen some incredible work being done on the SCUMM engine. Yes, there are the usual bug fixes, but this time we are also adding a feature that helps playing the SCUMM games in a truly original fashion: Support for the original loading and saving dialogs within the GUI!\nSpeaking of truly original: Remember those old CRT displays we had back in the day? With ScummVM 2.7.0 you’ll be able to replicate this experience on certain platforms thanks to our new shader-based scalers. Go ahead and give it a try!\nAll testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.\nA detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.\nThank you very much for your support! Let’s make ScummVM 2.7.0 a great release - together!\n>",

Depending on your perspective, we’re either two months early for our usual April 1st release, or a bit tardy for the Christmas 2022 release we intended. We think the wait has been worth it. This is one of the largest releases we’ve done in several years, with numerous features and improvements covering the user interface, gameplay features, and modding extensions for NewGRF and Game Script creators. Some of the highlights are: Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. This includes better automatic scaling when using HiDPI or mixed DPI setups. Direct access to NewGRF/AI/GS settings from the new game window. Various small tweaks and improvements to several windows. NewGRFs can now provide engine variants that are shown hierarchically in the purchase list. Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. Custom league tables for GameScripts. More natural rivers which get wider as they flow downstream. And much more, which can be seen in the changelog or the previous release announcements! In addition to these features and improvements, we’ve fixed lots of bugs. (If you played with the RC2 testing release, most were fixed before then. See the changelog for full details.)
