Well, in the internet age, everything happens eventually, so here's that game. In Save Room from Fractal Projects, you have a limited and specifically shaped inventory space on the left and a load of guns and stuff on the right. Simply slot the guns into the space, like a military tangram puzzle.\nYou also need to ensure your health meter is full and your guns are loaded at the end of the stage. Easy: eat the bad stuff then eat the healing stuff; if a gun needs ammo, put the ammo in it. You may need to combine herbs or gunpowders first, but it's all monkey-trainable stuff. Once thus pared down, simply slot the guns and herbs into the space, like a drug dealer's jigsaw.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Fortunately, the follow-up presentation outlined the steps that the company is making in this field, notably concerning energy usage in its consoles and reductions to unnecessary packaging.\nThe first of these points is less about what Nintendo is going to do to combat its energy consumption, and more about what it already has done on this front. The presentation notes how the Switch has continually reduced its energy usage since its release in 2017. While the original console released all those years ago would use (on average) 12w when played in docked mode, the current model only uses 7w and the OLED is even more efficient on 6w.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

I’m either marching to an in-game shopkeeper and holding my adventuring sack upside down, or just swiftly frisbeeing items straight into the bin. If it’s cluttering my screen, it’s cluttering my mind. Zero regrets. That’s the gamer dopamine hit I’m chasing.\nSo, as you might have guessed, I love the idea of A Little To The Left, a game that celebrates neatness and tidiness through a string of fun puzzles. If you love the satisfaction of arranging books on your shelf in order of height, or displaying your mugs in order of which can hold the most tea, then you’ll love this game too. Some simple tidying puzzles would have been enough for me, but A Little To The Left takes the idea in interesting directions through smart puzzle design.\nRead more",

It turns out the guy who owns eight physical copies (and four digital) of the original Resident Evil 4 is still pretty excited to play the remake. Who ever could have predicted this?\n\n\r\nThe day my preview went live, Capcom showed off a couple of additional bits as part of a hefty Resident Evil showcase. Alongside a fresh story trailer the company also discussed the various gubbins you’ll receive if you fork out for the game's special edition as well as a short gameplay demonstration. Surprising no one, I’ve watched these clips so many times I now have a load of thoughts that are not only completely useless but are taking up vital brain space I usually reserve for things like pin numbers and dates. If I don’t vent all of this garbage out of my skull there’s a chance I’ll forget my Mam’s birthday again, something that genuinely happened once when I was 17 and I haven’t stopped feeling guilty about it since.

Baba Yaga has been forced to live in the forest having been accused of witchcraft, so it seems like one of those self-fulfilling prophecy deals.\nIt's a very brightly coloured, fantastical world, this forest you live in, and you're dropped in media res. I thought that hands-on preview I got would be quite a casual gadabout talking to a cute dragon and what have you, but in fact it was difficult, and weird, and very opaque in the best way. The res in question included treasure chests with teeth and talking pine-cone spirits, and exploding fireflies. But you're an archer, too, and I really, really hate using arrows in first-person, and I don't think that will change.\nRead more",

The person died in a hospital bed surrounded by their closest friends and family, and after they've passed on the group begins to share stories and memories from when they were alive. Death isn’t always this calm and it isn’t always this peaceful, but on rare occasions it can be. \nThis is how developers Florian Veltman and Baptiste Portefaix have approached death in How To Say Goodbye, a cosy game that explores the topic with kindness and sensitivity. With its paper doll illustrations and pastel colour palette, it kinda feels like a children's pop-up book that teaches kids about grief. It’s not overly sweet or patronising, just a gentle game about a group of ghosts who discover how to mourn, how to accept their own death, and how to move on.\nRead more",

The World War One FPS has been spotted nestled in Steam’s top ten best-selling games rankings (thanks, Emopulse), although it's since slipped out again. Battlefield 1’s also set a record over the weekend for its all-time highest concurrent player numbers, reaching more than 50,000 players in the past 24 hours. I say, tip top.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "It's been an interesting exercise playing Triangle Strategy and Tactics Ogre: Reborn in quick succession lately. I've now played both Square Enix strategy RPGs for around six hours apiece now - starting with Tactics Ogre for my preview the other week, and following it up with a Triangle-shaped chaser. I didn't have any history with either game before now, but it's become increasingly apparent that they're effectively cut from the same tile-based cloth. And I mean, exactly the same. They're so similar, in fact, that it's kinda hilarious Square are releasing them so close together on PC, with Tactics Ogre's release on November 11th following little more than a month after Triangle Strategy. \nAt the same time, though, their approach to story-telling couldn't be more different, and comparing and contrasting them like this one after the other has been both fun and enlightening. Triangle Strategy, for example, is about 80% cutscene, 20% fighting for its first six hours, while Tactics Ogre is pretty much the opposite. And yet… I think I sort of prefer Triangle Strategy? Let me explain.\nRead more",

A PS5 demo came out and I only got to spend all of five minutes with it before life got in the way. I never got to truly taste the jam, which was quite sad. So, colour me very excited when I got to spend a good couple of hours battling through two short hands-on demos. I got battered by a big pig, prickled to death by a massive porcupine, and aggressively mauled by a large tiger. And I'd say I had a whale of a time. There was no killer whale in the demo, but I wouldn't count it out for the full release.\nRead more",

These are both high-end GPUs, set to cost $899 and $999 respectively when they release on December 13th, but you’ll note those prices are oodles cheaper than the £1269 / $1199 RTX 4080 and the £1679 / $1599 RTX 4090.\nThey’re also structurally distinct from the current Radeon RX 6000 cards to an extent that, frankly, is quite surprising to see from AMD GPUs. RDNA 3 uses a Ryzen CPU-inspired chiplet design, where the GPU is split up into different sections, and the new media engine is engineered for the 4K gaming monitors of the future as much as it is for current PC hardware. \nRead more",

          "description": "Ghost Song is a 2D Metroid-like that's always a feast for the eyes, but a frequent frustration for your head and hands. Its gorgeous art direction depicts a vibrant alien world that bubbles and throbs with bio-mechanical life, where spore clouds and fleshy organic tunnels live side by side with floating metal skulls and impenetrable thickets of wires and cables. It's a fascinating place that seems to morph and change with every passing map segment, calling to mind the animated techno gunge of Akira and Metropolis one minute, and the flowering brilliance of Alex Garland's Annihilation the next. Its roots sink deep, creating a world you'll want to explore every last nook and cranny of as you delve deeper into its underbelly to find out why you're here.\nBut Deadsuit, your android-like protagonist, makes for a slightly rusty-feeling companion at times, lacking the grace and elegance of Nintendo's Samus Aran, and the nimble dexterity of Team Cherry's nameless knight. It will tide you over until Silksong arrives, for sure, but it also never quite sings in the way you'd hope.\nRead more",

          "description": "As Replika Elster, Signalis will force you to untangle a mess of writhing flesh and malfunctioning memories to separate dream from lived experience. So, in keeping with dream logic: You’ve played Signalis before, and you’ve never played anything like it. It lovingly adopts the trappings of PS1-era survival horror, and more importantly, it fully understands why those systems, aesthetics, tropes, and technical limits are so engaging. But it also presents and explores love and loss, freedom and manipulation, fear and trauma, in its own cruelly captivating way. It’s strange and familiar, gorgeous and horrible. It’s an absolute banger of a videogame, made all the more impressive by its indiest of indies price tag and two-person dev team.\nFundamentally, it's a love story. Things go bad for space technician Elster, but she made a promise she intends to keep. We’ll get back to this later. First up: Signalis excels at capturing the essence of survival horror - those juxtaposed feelings of possibility and unease that hit you entering a long hallway, flanked by doors, only to find all but two locked or malfunctioning. You’ll be back here soon enough, you know that. Probably with a new key. Maybe with a new gun. But there’s also a good chance things will have…changed, by then. A floor tile might reveal new horrors. You might have spent your last bullet. So, left or right? Or maybe back? You can only carry six items, after all.\nRead more",

No matter how much Nintendo tries to clamp down, some content creator is likely going to show off part of the game, and/or someone is probably going to buy it early from any number of retailers that break street date. Well the latter is exactly what happened, so be aware that Pokemon Scarlet and Violet leaks are out in the wild.\nAs was the case with Legends, Twitter is the main source of leak sharing. Many users are getting takedown notices from Nintendo and The Pokemon Company, leading to even more proliferation and more sharing. A heap of these do not have spoiler warning shields, and are just flying around. So you may want to mute anything Pokemon related if you use the platform regularly, or just stay off of it entirely for a bit if you're really bothered by leaks.\nMost Pokemon subreddits have extensive leak policies in place that prevent accidental reveals: including the \"main\" one, so you might be safe there.\nPokemon Scarlet/Violet: Leaks\nThe Pokemon Leaks reddit has compiled a full list so far, which is fully in text form. This is by far the safest place to look, as Twitter is sometimes inaccurate (people throwing in fake leaks), constantly riddled with takedowns, and hard to search.\nThe post Watch out for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet leaks, they’re everywhere appeared first on Destructoid.",

There are also specific stability fixes for both PS4 and PS5. You can check out the huge list of fixes via the official patch notes, though be warned that SSM suggests that the tweaks feature minor spoilers pertaining to abilities, creatures, and questlines. The update should download as soon as you install the game.\nGod of War Ragnarok is the follow-up to the stellar 2018 release, God of War. The new title follows the continued adventures of an aging Kratos and his brave but somewhat inexperienced son, Atreus, as they face the coming of Ragnarok — the fabled event said to bring death and destruction to a number of gods and figures of power, while bringing chaos to the world and its climate. Quite what role our heroes will play in this event, and how it ties into the lives of their allies and enemies...

It was also part of that partially correct, partially incorrect Nvidia PC leak from 2021.\nHere are the games Sony currently has on PC/Steam:\nGod of War (2018)\nSpider-Man Remastered\nSpider-Man: Miles Morales (out on November 18)\nUncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection (Uncharted 4 and Lost Legacy)\nSackboy: A Big Adventure\nNote that the earliest game is God of War, and it was released in January of this year. Yep, all of the above list launched in 2022. Sony is clearly serious about porting their biggest games to PC, and if Sackboy can make the cut, a lot of other titles could too.\nBut Ghost of Tsushima, like many other open world games, would be incredible to mess around with on PC. I mean, just imagine the mods! And the graphical options! While it hasn't happened yet, I'm hoping we get some form of announcement in early 2023, perhaps via a State of Play. This feels like a sure thing at this point.\nThe post We need a Ghost of Tsushima PC port like, now appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "\"Cumulative global sell-in of amiibo figures has surpassed 77 million units.\"\nNintendo expanded upon their financial result release for the fiscal year ending in 2023 today, and provided a closer look at some of their best-performing individual IP. One such look was at amiibo, which have slowed down considerably since their 2014 debut: but still persist nonetheless.\nHere's what Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa had to say about amiibo:\n\"Next, I would like to discuss amiibo, which we launched in 2014. Tapping an amiibo to an NFC touchpoint on hardware can have all kinds of fun results in compatible games, such as the in-game appearance of the amiibo character or special items. We continue to release new amiibo products each year, and cumulative global sell-in of amiibo figures has surpassed 77 million units.\"\n\nMost of it is a boiler plate statement to keep investors interested in the idea of amiibo, but reading between the lines, Nintendo has no real reason to give up on the initiative yet. They're seemingly still selling, and the statement hints considerably at keeping the amiibo side of the business alive; at least in the short term.\nIf you're curious about what the future holds for amiibo: as always, you can check out when those were released here in our master amiibo list, which has been updated since 2014. In the short term, the Splatoon 3 amiibo are just around the corner, and are scheduled to arrive on November 11.\nThe post Despite slowed amiibo releases, Nintendo has shipped over 77 million of them appeared first on Destructoid.",

TiMi Studio has had experience with the handling of major gaming IPs before, having worked on mobile spin-offs such as Pokemon Unite, Call of Duty Mobile, and The King of Fighters: Destiny.

          "description": "Just do it in an app\nBack in my day, our 3D Sonic games had Chao Gardens. OK, so maybe it was only really for Sonic Adventure 2, and anyone who was caught in that web at the time just eternally associates Chaos with Sonic (ha). To be fair, they have appeared in various games as mascots of sorts, and as several higher-ups in Sega have pointed out: they are present in spinoffs like Team Sonic Racing. Sadly, Sonic Frontiers continues the trend of not having an in-game Chao Garden. But I think it's time to change that.\nI know some of you are probably sighing at the idea of digging up an old 3D Sonic trend, but there's so much potential here. Most people liked the Chao Adventure gimmick with the VMU, right? While not quite a \"garden\" per se, the idea of getting a whole extra game within a game was mind blowing at the time. I mean, the VMU was way ahead of its time too, but learning that you just bought Sonic Adventure and got a free digital Tamagotchi pet was insane: and part of the reason why the Dreamcast earned its reputation as a quirky and enduring console. All of that can be done within an app now, which can interact with any given future Sonic entry.\nFunnily enough, producer for Sonic Frontiers, Takashi Iizuka, laughed when asked about Chaos earlier this year. Game Informer spoke to him with a \"rapid fire\" question format, and asked \"is there a Chao Garden in the game,\" he replied firmly with a \"no.\" The next rapid fire question was \"are Chaos just extinct at this point?\" which he also replied with \"no,\" while laughing. You can find that segment here at this timestamp (4:50).\nThe post Bring back the Chao Garden for games like Sonic Frontiers appeared first on Destructoid.",

Still, like many fans, I was hoping to see further evidence of some classic (or \"nostalgia\") skins, allowing our heroes and villains to rock their more iconic wardrobes.\nAnd we have just gotten our first real look of said gear, courtesy of yer boy Ken Masters.\nThe newest issue of Game Informer has a stylish cover, which sees the down-and-out millionaire dropping his construction garb and donning his iconic red karate gi. This cover image marks the first official shot Capcom has released spotlighting a new character model wearing an alternate skin. Better yet, if you check out Game Informer's \"Cover Story\" video, you can also glimpse some over-the-shoulder footage of both Chun-Li and Ryu throwing down whilst kitted out in their own classic SFII garb.\nIt's somewhat early for Capcom to be showing off these nostalgia skins, especially if they are scheduled to be released as paid DLC. In my previous \"Do's and Do Not Do's\" article, I noted that it would be wise for the publisher to offer players something in the way of a reward for playing through Arcade/Story mode, suggesting that nostalgia costumes would be a respectable prize. While these images are no confirmation that the classic gear will be bundled with the game at launch, it's difficult not to get excited. After all, the studio is doing a damn fine job with SF6 so far.\nStreet Fighter 6 launches 2023 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

This week, pre-order customers noticed that their purchase had been refunded, further suggesting that the title had been quietly buried beneath the Persian dunes.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htzq7EEXQs8\nNoting this, Ubisoft opened a special FAQ page, hoping to answer the fans' questions and concerns over the fragile-looking release. According to the FAQ, the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake has not been canceled, and remains in development at Ubisoft Montreal, (the studio gaining control of the project from its brethren Ubisoft Mumbai). Ubisoft says that refunds were issued due to a total lack of availability on an expected release date.\nElsewhere in the FAQ, Ubisoft also notes that it has no plans to remake any other classic Prince of Persia titles.

DeNA is, in particular, responsible for the integration of player accounts and in-game communications. As partners, the two companies hope to research and develop more advanced technology and software for future Nintendo mobile titles and/or applications.\nThe post Nintendo announces partnership with mobile company DeNA appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Press in the left analog stick near rings\nSo Sonic Frontiers is out today, and there's a lot little nuances that don't matter (especially with the variety of combat abilities), and there's some that do. Making sure that you remember that the Light Speed Dash ability even exists can be huge in terms of minute-to-minute Frontiers play.\nUnlike a heap of powers in Sonic Frontiers, that need to either be unlocked via the skill tree or story progression, you can Light Speed Dash immediately. All you need to do is press the left analog stick in when you're near a trail of rings, and Sonic will instant micro-dash (without a boost meter requirement) toward said ring formation. You can use the Light Speed Dash to get some extra air when Sonic is falling, collect a lot of rings quickly during a fight, or solve some puzzles.\nI literally played hours of the game not recalling that this technique existed. I even quickly an inadvertently did a load screen tutorial sequence with it, and still forgot about it for a bit! Given that it's largely not needed to get around (double-jumping and a breezy R2/RT dash take care of that), it is easy to block out of your mind.\nBut like me, you'll probably come across some situation where you're falling and quickly remember: the Light Speed Dash exists.\nThe post Don’t forget to Light Speed Dash constantly in Sonic Frontiers appeared first on Destructoid.",

Taking time out from her own vigilante squad, \"The Flock\", Provie will be ably helping the River City Girls in their fist-flinging battle against the powerful Sabu crime family.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9rJZMWam-A\nRiver City Girls 2 was first revealed way back in the summer of 2021, with the team at WayForward drip-feeding characters, features, and rad new 'choons since the title's initial reveal. While we are still yet to receive a western release date for the sequel's launch, (it's getting a little tight on that \"2022\" release date now). The sequel, though similar in design to the 2020 original, will feature several new features including simultaneous four-player co-op action, and a variety of stylishly designed new boss characters.\nRiver City Girls 2 is in development for PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

The previous record to hit the Big Billion was held by the excellent 2012 entry Call of Duty: Black Ops 2, which hit the 10-digit mark in 15 days.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeVapCrI1pY\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare II continues the reboot/reboot storyline that began with 2019's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. The plot details a violent, globe-trotting campaign that sees Task Force 141, once again headed up by Captain Price, attempt to dismantle a dangerous arms cartel that threatens to bring death and destruction to the United States. In curious fashion, the game works as both a brand new title and a prequel to the previous Modern Warfare releases from the mid-'00s.\nFollowing on from the relatively blah welcoming received by 2021's Call of Duty Vanguard. Activision will no doubt be breathing a sigh of relief that, for now at any rate, the Call of Duty franchise remains untarnished from both a popularity and financial standpoint, with MWII's success likely pointing to further years of entries in one of the industry's most lucrative franchises.\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is available now on PlayStation, PC (Steam/Battle.net), and Xbox.\nThe post Modern Warfare II has hit $1 billion in revenue in just 10 days appeared first on Destructoid.",

Now, a new financial report for the fiscal year ending in March 2023 is backing up what we found out in September: with hopefully no delays in sight.\nSo there's a few things to note here. Pikmin 4 is still just \"2023\" without a window in mind: which seems perfect for an E3 release date announcement for Q3 or Q4. Metroid Prime 4 (which is still a working title, or notated as \"temp\" in the financial report) is in the works and doesn't even have a year in mind. Plus, Advance Wars 1+2 Re-Boot Camp is \"TBA\" as of November 2022.\nAs far as other regions go, Europe seems to be on the same timeline as the US. Japan is welcoming Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope (which most of the world already has) on December 2, and the Re-Boot Camp \"TBA\" listing is completely missing. No doubt we'll get more info and maybe even another Direct as we head into early 2023.\nNintendo's 2023 first party Switch release dates:\nFire Emblem Engage - 1/20/2023\nKirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe - 2/24/2023\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - 5/12/2023\nPikmin 4 - 2023\nMetroid Prime 4 - TBA\nAdvance Wars 1+2 Re-Boot Camp - TBA\nThe post Nintendo commits to 2023 first party release dates in new financial results appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Pump the Brakes\nElectronic Arts, in an internal statement acquired by GamesIndustry.biz, has announced that it is ending the Project CARS racing franchise, effective immediately. This makes the final release in the simulation series the mobile title Project CARS GO, which launched on iOS and Android in 2021.\n\"Today we announced internally an update to our racing portfolio. Following an evaluation of the next Project CARS title and its longer-term growth potential, we have made the decision to stop further development and investment for the franchise,\" reads the statement. \"Decisions like these are very hard, but allow us to prioritise our focus in areas where we believe we have the strongest opportunity to create experiences that fans will love.\"\n\"We are working with everyone impacted by this decision to place them into suitable roles across our EA Sports and racing portfolio, as well as other parts of EA, wherever we can. Our priority now is on providing as much support as possible to our people through this transition.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BPzkjvV_Rk\nThe Project CARS IP became the property of EA following the purchase of Codemasters and its subsidiaries, (including CARS developer Slightly Mad Studios), in December 2020. At the time of purchase, Slightly Mad had somewhere in the region of 150 employees, and so here's to hoping that EA will ensure new roles for the studio's staff throughout its myriad other development and publishing wings.\nThere have been four Project CARS games in total, including Project CARS GO. Though the first two games received critical and fan acclaim, Project CARS 3 was less warmly received. Earlier this year, it was announced that the first two titles were to be delisted from sale due to the expiration of in-game licenses, and it would seem that EA has decided that this particular racer has run its course.\nThe post EA is officially ending the Project CARS franchise appeared first on Destructoid.",

We spoke with Williams about why God of War 2018's director, Cory Barlog, had to convince him to take on the role, why nearly every God of War game has a new director, how he discovered he is not able to generate visuals in his mind's eye, how the surprising casting of Richard Schiff as Odin came about, and plenty more.

The current edition of D&D supports tremendous flexibility in playing out combat how you like, including through tabletop miniature play, allowing big battles to flow out from ongoing campaign storylines in your weekly sessions. However, perhaps your group is more into combat than interconnected storylines. Or, more likely, you sometimes just want a break from the campaign planning to have a focused evening of combat. If that’s the case, WizKids’ new Dungeons & Dragons: Onslaught game should be on your radar. \nIn recent weeks, I had the good fortune to look at what Onslaught has in sto…",

You can also catch up on previous episodes by visiting our new Game Informer Shows YouTube channel or watching the latest episode embedded below. \nMetal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. \n\n\nJoin me, Marcus Stewart, and Blake Hester as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure.

The studio has been quite open with its accessibility desires, detailing more than 60 in a blog post earlier this year. Now, with the game out on November 9, the studio has released an even more detailed post breaking down exactly what to expect. \n\n\nSanta Monica Studio says there are more than 70 features in Ragnarok that \"enable players to customize the gameplay experience to suit their needs\" and the list is a sight to behold. It includes plenty of presets, too, which could make it easier for players to easily get the game started in a way that makes the experience better for them. Presets include one for vision accessibility, hearing accessibility, motion reduction, apply motor accessibility, and a changed setting indicator as well. \nThere are alternative control schemes, remappable buttons, hold and press options, in-game assistance settings, and so much more. If you're interested in what accessibility features are in Ragnarok, be sure to check out the full blog post. \nFor more, read Game Informer's God of War Ragnarok review and then check out all of the performance and quality modes for the game. \nWhich accessibility features do you find most helpful in games?

As for why, she says the working dynamic with the game's audio director has become difficult and she sees no path forward. Variety reports that the audio director in question is Stephen Miller but Schachner doesn't name this person in her announcement. \nNews of her departure comes from a statement released by Schachner on Twitter on November 3, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. Schachner's departure comes after years of work with Modern Warfare II studio Infinity Ward on games like 2019's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and 2016's Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare. Other credits include Assassin's Creed Valhalla and Anthem, as noted by VGC. \n\"I am sad to say I can no longer continue to compose music for MWII/Warzone,\" her statement reads. \"Over the past couple of months, the working dynamic with the audio director has become increasingly challenging and I don't see any path forward. As of now, I am unsure of the status and release plan for the soundtrack as it's been taken out of my hands. While I don't have any control over how the music is presented in-game, what will be released on the soundtrack is not my artistic intent in regards to mixing and mastering.\" \nShe then thanks fans for their support and gives some shout outs to others involved with the game's score, including mixer Frank Wolf, \"creative vision\" Mike Dean, and performing artists including Baseck, Brain Mantia, and M.B. Gordy.\nYou can read her full statement below: \nMany of you have been asking about the MWII soundtrack release.\npic.twitter.com/UEqgpCTjUg\nNovember 3, 2022\nFor more, read Game Informer's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II review. \n[Source: Video Games Chronicle]\nWhat are your thoughts on the score of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II?

          "description": "Ubisoft has rolled out its post-launch content roadmap for Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope. Owners of the game’s season pass, whether purchased separately for $29.99 or bundled in the game’s $89.99 Gold Edition, have three big adventures aimed at keeping them glued to the game throughout 2023. \nIt all kicks off early next year with the first expansion, Tower of Doooom (their spelling, not mine). This introduces a new combat mode where the team must fight their way up Madame Bwahstrella’s multi-story tower to rescue Spawny, the visor-rocking Rabbid from Kingdom Battle. What’s important to note is that Tower of Doooom will be exclusive to the season pass, meaning you’ll be unable to purchase it separately. \nThe second untitled DLC arrives in mid-2023. So far, we only know it takes players to a new planet, features never-before-seen enemies, allies, and secrets, and stars a new antagonist. Finally, Rayman crashes the party in the final expansion to close out the year. Ubisoft’s limbless hero joins Rabbid Peach and Rabbid Mario on a separate adventure in a new location. Unlike Tower of Doooom, the second and third expansions can be purchased a la carte. \nI enjoyed Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope quite a bit, awarding it a 9 out of 10. In my review, which you can read here, I wrote that the game “builds upon Kingdom Battle’s foundation with smart tweaks and fun additions to emerge as a better game in every way.”",

Developer Mundfish and publisher Focus Entertainment announced this news in a new and bloody gameplay trailer showcasing more of what to expect in the game early next year. \nCheck out the Atomic Heart release date trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Atomic Heart continues to look great in trailers and I can't wait to finally go hands-on with it in just four months, especially as a fan of BioShock. While Atomic Heart is doing its own thing, it's hard not to compare it to the BioShock series given the whole alternate reality thing, the types of guns on display here, the enemies we'll be facing, and the hand-controlled powers. \nAtomic Heart was revealed years ago, and there are plenty more trailers to watch if you're interested. Check out this 2020 gameplay trailer for an early look at the game, and then watch this 2021 trailer for a look at the creepier side of Atomic Heart. Find out why it's one of our most anticipated horror games after that, and then watch this action-packed combat trailer from earlier this summer. \nFor additional information about Atomic Heart, be sure to check out Mundfish's official website, where there's info about the game's different editions available for preorder and more. \nAre you excited about Atomic Heart?

          "description": "According to a Bloomberg report, video game publisher Embracer has shut down Onoma, the studio formerly known as Square Enix Montreal, just months after its acquisition. Some staff will be transferred to Eidos Montreal, another studio owned by Embracer. This news comes just a few weeks after Onoma underwent a rebranding process where it adopted the new name.\nOnoma was best known for its work on the Go series, turn-based spin-offs of popular Eidos Interactive titles designed for mobile. This includes Hitman Go, Lara Croft Go, and Deus Ex Go. Their most recent work was Tomb Raider Reloaded, which came to mobile devices earlier this year, and their future plans involved a title based on Avatar: The Last Airbender.\nEarlier this year, Onoma was just one part of a much larger series of Embracer’s acquisitions, which included Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montreal. In August, Embracer proceeded to acquire Limited Run Games, Tripwire Interactive, Tuxedo Labs, the IP rights to The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, and several more studios.\nThe Bloomberg report also says that the closure is part of a cost-cutting initiative, and that Eidos Montreal will have projects scaled back and cut as well. Some of these resources will be redirected to assist in the development of a game in the Fable franchise, led by Playground Games.\n[Source: Bloomberg]\nWere you a fan of the Go series?

          "description": "The official Sonic the Hedgehog YouTube channel has uploaded an animated short titled “Sonic Frontiers Prologue: Divergence.” Starring Knuckles, the short reveals how he wound up on the island players explore in Sonic Frontiers. You can watch the six-minute animation in its entirety below.\n\n\nIn the trailer, Knuckles provides a voice-over explanation of his background up until now, including the fact that he was tasked with guarding the Master Emerald, a relic that hasn’t appeared in the Sonic series for quite some time. The trailer ends with Knuckles absolutely demolishing some robots, and while we’ve received no indication that he will be playable in Sonic Frontiers, that sequence makes me hope he will be.\nKnuckles has been a core Sonic character for most of the franchise’s existence, so it’s not surprising that he’s making an appearance in the blue blur’s latest adventure. While this animated prologue gives us insight into how he wound up on the island, it’s still not entirely clear why, especially when it comes to the appearance of Sage (a new character introduced in Sonic Frontiers) at the end of the trailer. We’ll have to wait for the full game to find out.\nThe past month has been full of Sonic news. We got a December 14 release date for Sonic Prime, Sonic Frontiers got a trailer confirming Super Sonic would be playable in the game, and we learned that the Sonic series has sold over 1.5 billion copies worldwide. For more Sonic news, check out our cover story from earlier this year, and stay tuned for more Sonic Frontiers coverage when the game releases on November 8.",

Instead, Netflix will provide them with financial support, which Spry Fox says will allow them to “stop stressing” about how their games will generate profit. Despite all of Netflix’s current games existing through their mobile app, the blog post does not mention anything about platform exclusivity.\nSpry Fox joins five other in-house game developers at Netflix: Next Games (Stranger Things: Puzzle Tales), Night School Studio (Oxenfree), Boss Fight Entertainment (Dungeon Boss), and two internal studios in Helsinki, Finland and southern California.\nNetflix launched its games collection just over a year ago, in November of 2021.

That was a vaguely defined arrangement at the time, but we now know the partnership will produce a minimum of three titles.\nEA announced the news in a press release, with the publisher describing it as a “long-term” deal that could extend beyond three games based on the wording. The release also specifies these titles will be action-adventure games for consoles and PC, each featuring original stories in the Marvel universe. \nIt's worth clarifying that EA is not getting exclusive rights to Marvel like it had with Star Wars. There are multiple Marvel games in the works at various studios, including the recently announced Captain America/Black Panther game from Amy Hennig’s Skydance New Media. \n“We have been long-time fans of Marvel and their impressive leadership, so this is a remarkable moment for our developers as well as our players and fans,” said EA COO Laura Miele. “We look forward to welcoming Marvel into the EA family of creators and know this collaboration will produce exceptional experiences for our players. We can’t wait to see players' reactions when they suit up as Iron Man and do the extraordinary things this Super Hero is known for.”\nWe’re curious to learn what other Marvel projects are on the docket and which EA studios are behind them. Motive’s Iron Man, a single-player third-person action game, is currently in pre-production, so it’s a long way from release (the team is also making the Dead Space remake).

He released a statement explaining that it was time for him to put down the swords and expressing his enthusiasm for Hemsworth's casting in the role. \n\"My journey as Geralt of Rivia has been filled with both monsters and adventures and alas, I will be laying down my medallion and my swords for Season 4,\" Cavill's statement reads. \"In my stead, the fantastic Mr. Liam Hemsworth will be taking up the mantle of the White Wolf.

The wacky cat-breeding roguelike is the brainchild of Super Meat Boy co-creator and The Binding of Isaac mastermind Edmund McMillen and has been in and out of the works for a decade. After being announced, put on hold, and restarted, it appears to have a new release window. \nMcMillen tweeted a gif of two of the game’s adorable cats engaging in what we'll call an intimate cat exercise. The tweet links to the game’s Steam page, which lists a 2024 release window.\nHold on to your Butts!https://t.co/wDBOizNXGl pic.twitter.com/MESXJFFXsh\nOctober 28, 2022\nWhat the heck is Mewgenics? The game tasks players with collecting and breeding hundreds of cats to train and send into battle. Or, as the Steam description puts it, Mewgenics is a “turn-based legacy roguelike draft sim about cats!” The game apparently boasts “100s of hours” of gameplay, multiple classes with over 50 unique abilities, over 200 enemies, and other features. \nMewgenics was first announced in 2012, with McMillen at the time describing it as \"By far the strangest project I've ever worked on.” McMillen has worked on it alongside Tyler Glaiel; the pair previously partnered for The End is Nigh, among other titles. The game was originally billed as a cross between Pokémon, The Sims, and Animal Crossing, and had first been planned to release in 2014. It was, of course, delayed, and its development was put on indefinite hold in 2016 when McMillen began work on The Legend of Bum-Bo, which launched in 2019. At the time, McMillen was unsure of Mewgenics’ future, but in 2018 he announced he was remaking the game to be released in “a few years.” \nThe game is slated to launch for PC, though whether or not it’s still coming to iOS is unknown. Are you still interested in Mewgenics? Let us know in the comments! For more on Edmund McMillen, we spoke with him last December where he discussed his life and career, including Mewgenics, which you can read in this interview feature.",

Silver Tempest stars Alolan Vulpix on the key art, but monsters like Lugia, Serperior, Ho-Oh, and Mawile share the spotlight. Meanwhile, players can expect cards starring Regieleki and Regidrago.\nThe Pokémon Company sent us several booster packs so we could open them and see what we pull. While it may just be dumb luck, I feel like this expansion gave me better pulls than any others in recent memory. As I cracked these open, I was met with several attractive full-art cards, as well as some gorgeous Trainer Gallery cards. I even managed to pull two of the three new Radiant Pokémon cards. \nThis expansion adds over 190 cards to the ever-growing library of Pokémon cards. That number includes 6 Pokémon VSTAR cards, 15 Pokémon V cards, 1 Pokémon VMAX card, 30 special art Trainer Gallery cards, and more than 15 Trainer cards.
