Fans expecting the usual fare from a Digimon game might be understandably disappointed, but for those with an appetite for visual novels and tactical RPG combat, there is plenty to get your teeth sunk into here. It might not be the best Digimon game you can buy, but it is certainly one of the best visual novels to come out this year. From the writing to the visuals, this is an exceptional title, provided you know what you're getting ahead of time.\nWhile it features creatures familiar to Digimon fans, this title stands as a departure in tone and genre from previous instalments. Digimon Survive serves as a mystery visual novel with surprisingly dark imagery. Particularly in the opening chapters, the game is closer to a horror story than we certainly expected. There are even a few jump scares mixed in to contend with.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Fortunately, that seems to be more than just pastel colours and cynical “For girls” marketing – the G375 headset, G705 mouse, and the G715 and G713 keyboards are all proper gaming-spec accessories, and they’ve been crafted by mostly female design and engineering teams based on feedback from women PC players.\r\n\n\r\nThe G705, then, is a wireless mouse designed for smaller hands, while the G375 headset – also wireless – is proportioned to fit smaller heads and has more space in the earcups to accommodate earrings. It’s safe to say I’m not the Aurora Collection’s target audience, but having used the G705, the G375, and the G715 wireless keyboard as my main peripherals for a few days, I can say all three are pretty swish playthings regardless of how you identify. What’s more, their light, soft-cornered aesthetic is a nice break from the blacks, greys and harsh angles that have become standard design language for gaming gear. Anyone who’s ever cringed their face inside out at a peripheral resembling Megatron’s running shoe may indeed find these more to their tastes.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I've had a cracking gaming year, and I thinnnk that's down to lots of new games? Maybe? This type of question has always brushed over the fact that people play games for years and start 'old' games all the time, and maybe it's less useful than ever now every other game is a live service. But I've had a good gaming year, and that's what matters. So what are you playing this weekend? Here's what we're clicking on!\nRead more",

          "description": "In the age of years-long development cycles, it seems miraculous that Wolfenstein 3D, a game that spawned the modern-day FPS as we know it, was developed by six people in just six months. The story of Wolfenstein 3D’s development makes for a fascinating time capsule of those early days of game development - a milestone in gaming history that underlines just how much the industry has grown over the decades since.\nBut that’s getting ahead of ourselves a bit. The origins of Wolfenstein 3D, a gloriously violent game that paved the way for the even more gloriously violent Doom, can be found in a somewhat more cutesy series of titles: the Commander Keen series. id Software made four of these side-scrolling platformers for MS-DOS in very quick succession between 1990 and 1991, and studio co-founder John Romero tells us that the team was definitely ready for a change.\nRead more",

Since then, the team have been keeping game details under wraps, but now thanks to the Annapurna Interactive showcase, Outerloop have released a free Steam demo, meaning now we can all have a go at beating the pulp out of our exes - a dream come true. \nYou play as Jala, a young woman who just got booted out of her shared apartment after having a fight with her, now, ex-partner. With nowhere else to go, she’s decided to take the bus back to her hometown of Timber Hills to move back in with her parents (hopefully, temporarily). While she's killing time on the journey, she begins to take a dating personality quiz aptly titled ‘What’s your Thirstsona?’ and it transports her to a colourful dreamlike metaverse where she can skate around and answer deep questions about her love life. Is she really a lost cause in love? \nRead more",

Let us be thankful, then, for ADACA, an angry playmobil FPS.\nIt's actually two games, and I'm not sure which to call the main event. I know which one I prefer, because the story mode is a love letter to Half-Life 2, complete with Bane-muffled jackboot cops, endlessly catching up with a Story Guy who's inexplicably ahead of you again, a bionic arm standing in for the gravity gun, and a spooky dark underground section where you're swarmed by creepy mutants. It was good enough to tempt me this week, despite a few minor niggles, but its other half, Zone Patrol, is a Stalker-esque sandbox where it really shines.\nRead more",

Keys for Windows 7/8/10 work on Windows 11 too, so you probably already have a key lying around - or you can pick up a new one for less than £50 online.

          "description": "I’ve been excited to play Exoprimal, Capcom’s upcoming multiplayer dino shooter, ever since it used the phrase “unstoppable raptor horde” in one of its trailers. It is a completely unhinged combination of words that makes me giddy just thinking about them. I’ll often find myself muttering them out loud when I’m unloading the dishwasher or folding laundry. “Unstoppable raptor horde”. It’s like the season finale of language. It’s perfect.\r\n\n\r\nAdmittedly, prior to the existence of that phrase, I was feeling a little sceptical about Exoprimal’s existence. Not only does Capcom have - let’s say - a less than favourable track record when it comes to multiplayer titles, but as a long-term fan of Dino Crisis I was a bit miffed to see them creating a game featuring prehistoric creatures that wasn’t some kind of lavish remake of my beloved PS1 series.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I haven't done that with Hob's Barrow yet,\" he says. \"Basically, Victorian gothic horror story.

I really liked it. Please tell me you're going to be adding voice acting to this because it's screaming for it',\" Gilbert tells me. \"And he said, 'Well, we will if we can find a publisher who'll do it for us.'\" So now Wadjet Eye are publishing, and Gilbert is overseeing the voice recording.\nRead more",

Whether you're up to no good in Red Dead Redemption 2 or stealing from the rich to (sort of) give to the poor in the original Desperados, these temples of cash have long been the scenes of messy shootouts, upturned tables, and big, golden pay-outs. At least when your heist strategy's going according to plan, that is. In an exclusive demo for one of the later levels in Hard West 2, the upcoming sequel to the 2015 turn-based tactics original, Ice Code Games' chief technology officer Mateusz Pilski is starting to feel the heat a bit. The bank is well guarded, with at least half a dozen gunslingers staking out the doors at the front, and untold numbers waiting in hidden nooks and crannies further back. He takes a moment to consider his approach, but he begins his assault with confidence.  \n\"In any XCOM-like, when you see that many enemies and that much firepower, in that good a position, you think, okay, I'm fucked up,\" he tells me. \"In just a second, I will show you how you can use Bravado to totally overturn the situation.\"\nRead more",

I přes slunce lákající k výletům stále pátráme v internetovém prostoru po nových zajímavostech, které bychom Vám přinesli. A jaké to budou?\r\n\r\nJak poznat nebezpečná USB-C zařízení, která vám zapálí telefon a z domu udělají kůlničku na dříví. Jaké se objevily nové mikrokontroléry - konkurenti ESP32, levná a dostupná RISC-V, schopné 8051čky a jak se vůbec mikrokontroléry vyvíjely posledních 50 let. Dobrej hárdvér, a co softvér?\r\n\r\nAle ovšem, máme tu nový KiCAD 6.0.7, hustý update FW pro Průša Mini s podporou WiFi, NodeRED pro ESP, IR ovládání hloupých klimatizací a jejich integrace do smart domácnosti. Je to vše?\r\n\r\nNení Horste! To je jen ochutnávka aktualit, o kterých Vám můžeme něco říct. Mnohem více témat máme v záloze, ale hlavně můžete přijít Vy sami s vlastními tématy - právě o tom Virtuální Bastlírna totiž je!\r\n\r\nPříští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat ve středu 3. srpna od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končíme o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.",

          "description": "New Blood announces two dates at once\nWhile the date for one game is moving back a few weeks, another is sliding in to take its place. Publisher New Blood confirms that Gloomwood will have its Early Access launch pushed back, with Ultrakill Act 2 taking its spot.\nWhile the immersive sim Gloomwood was set to hit Early Access on August 16, the game will need some extra time to come together. A few issues have cropped up over the last few months, according to a statement, as well as some developers coming down with COVID-19. The team made the decision to push its release date back by three weeks, to September 6.\nhttps://twitter.com/NewBlood/status/1554532639259783168\nIt's a little extra time for those who have been patiently waiting, but from the ash arrives a new launch to take its place. New Blood confirms that the second act of Ultrakill, a retro-inspired FPS inspired by the heydays of the '90s, arrives on August 16.\nUltrakill, which is in Early Access right now, has an overwhelmingly positive reception so far on Steam's user reviews. And while it's only $20 at the moment, the price will be going up on August 16 with the launch of Act 2.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXiCFvaoVik\nHot swap launches\nWhile Gloomwood fans may be waiting a bit longer for their particular brand of immersive sim, there is at least more Ultrakill on the way to tide them over. And really, both seem to scratch an itch of retro-inspired first-person PC gaming. Just each in their own little way; Gloomwood in sneaking and surviving, and Ultrakill in over-the-top shooter fashion.\nIt's a fun swap that New Blood has done, and I'm down with it. Plus, Gloomwood also has a pre-alpha demo available on its Steam page right now, if you're quite eager to try it out. Ultrakill also has a demo, and Act 1 is currently in Early Access.\nThe post Gloomwood Early Access has been delayed, and Ultrakill Act 2 is moving into its slot appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Free games for a limited time\nGoogle Stadia may not have seen the massive success that the company was hoping for, but almost three years after its launch, the streaming service is still holding on. Now it seems that Google has a plan to get more players onboard, because they've just announced that they have over 120 game trials (and more on the way) that you can hop in and try out right now, no payment or Stadia account required. The catalog includes hit games like Assassin's Creed: Valhalla, Far Cry 6, Little Nightmares, Saints Row: The Third, Terraria, Spiritfarer, and many more. Of course, this deal isn't without its stipulations.\nThe trials may in fact be free, but players' time with each game is limited from anywhere between 120 minutes to 30 minutes, which is pretty insubstantial depending on which game you're playing.\nSo, it's looking like this is a better deal if you're already looking to try Stadia — as one Reddit user points out, playing the trials of games like Hotline Miami is actually a great way to see if Stadia's streaming will work with your network and hardware.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pwb6d2wK3Qw\nIf you're someone who doesn't want to drop a ton of money on a console or PC gaming rig, Stadia is a nice option, in theory, assuming that it works for you. Okay so maybe there are a lot of \"ifs\" at play here, but that never stopped Google, clearly.\nRegardless of the logistics, others on Reddit praised the trial model, and said they wished Steam would do the same thing. Games are expensive, and only raising in price, so it makes sense that players would want to try out a game before they commit to dropping some major cash for the full thing. If you've ever looked at Google Stadia and thought, \"it's a good idea, but...\" this is a good no-risk opportunity to give it the ol' college try.\nThe post Google Stadia has over 120 game trials, no subscription needed appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The long-awaited update is 'making very good progress,' according to ConcernedApe\nWhile fans have understandably grown impatient waiting for the much-later Stardew Valley 1.5 mobile update, the game's creator assures us that it is still on the way. In the latest status check, Eric \"ConcernedApe\" Barone said on Twitter that 1.5 may be ready before the end of 2022 — a far-off ETA, for sure, but something to latch onto at least.\n\"The 1.5 update for [Stardew Valley] mobile is making very good progress,\" he tweeted. \"It should be out before the end of the year. Mobile players... thanks for your patience.\"\nUpdate 1.5 includes Ginger Island, a new getaway to explore and expand, as well as numerous improvements to the core game. You can have a fish tank, watch ducks swim, move your bed, sit on chairs, raise ostriches, and try a beach farm layout. The list goes on.\n[caption id=\"attachment_337736\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1920\"] Ginger Islands is one of the best parts of Stardew Valley.[/caption]\nFrom the sound of it, all Barone can really do is relay and reiterate information as the Stardew Valley porting team continues working on the expansive update. And, in the meantime, he's busy working on his upcoming life-sim game, Haunted Chocolatier.\nWhenever the day comes, there's going to be a huge sigh of relief. Android and iOS players have been waiting for anything concrete, and with today's news, we're getting there.\nThis is the kind of long-lasting game that players (and the creator) can't seem to walk away from, and update 1.5, in particular, is a culmination of everything it represents as a wholesome slice-of-life experience. I've said it before and I'll say it again — Ginger Island is a highlight, and it's wild that it's a free update. I loved searching for collectibles.\n[Image credit: Nico-Kun]\nThe post Stardew Valley 1.5 mobile could hit before the end of 2022 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "\"The total walkable area\"\nJust how big is the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 world compared to the second game? A whopping five times as large, according to the developers.\nThis raw figure was disclosed via part three of an official developer interview series, featuring Tetsuya Takahashi (senior director and chief creative officer at Monolith Soft), Koh Kojima (producer and director at Monolith Soft), and Genki Yokota (producer and director at Nintendo).\nAfter being asked about the scope of the game, and how big it was intended to be as the third entry in a major series, Kojima laughed, and really let loose just how big the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 world really is:\n\"Come to think of it, we were just talking about this yesterday in the office. That the world would be crazy big for this title. So I actually did the math, and it turns out that the total walkable area in this game is over five times larger than in the second title. It was like... \"Yikes!\"\n\nKojima elaborates, citing the hindsight of accumulated knowledge from prior games to really allow this map to sing. This allowed the team to get more \"creative\" instead of just re-using variations of the same landscape concepts, and cites the danger of over-designing things like \"wall pattern\" aesthetics, which can cut into development time needed to implement more gameplay. Draw distance was apparently a priority though, and I think that was a good call — despite the limitations of the Switch hardware, the game managed to really surprise me at times with some amazing-looking vistas.\nIf you're interested in diving deeper into the world of Xenoblade Chronicles 3, you can find all three interviews from the series below!\nXenoblade Chronicles 3 interview series links:\nPart 1\nPart 2\nPart 3\nThe post The world of Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is “five times larger” than the second game appeared first on Destructoid.",

Sign me up!\nGiven the lower impact of this \"summer of gaming\" push, I wouldn't blame you for forgetting Wo Long, Team Ninja's \"dark fantasy version of the Later Han Dynasty” in action game form. But once the Wo Long demo comes out, provided that it's a blast, you'll probably be hearing about it then!\nYep, over on the game's official Twitter account, the studio is starting their marketing campaign early, noting that the game will have sorcery elements, as well as online multiplayer, a morale system, a character creator, and more. The last bullet point is the most important: a \"gameplay trial in the near future.\"\nStarting with the pre-launch period for Nioh years back, it's been customary for Team Ninja to test out their action game via highly prolific game trials: which also serve as a beta of sorts. It allows the studio to reevaluate their internal meta, adjust things like mechanics, animations, and difficulty curves; and even spotlights quality of life features.\nSo far it's worked out pretty great for them, as both Nioh entries have been bolstered by great beta-to-launch upgrades, and meaty post-launch patches. Given that Wo Long is out in \"early 2023\" (as of the time of publication), this will be plenty of time to assess and readjust if it is indeed coming \"in the near future.\"\nhttps://twitter.com/WoLongOfficial/status/1552751918853799936\nThe post Wo Long, Team Ninja’s Nioh follow-up, is getting a demo “in the near future” appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Fated Fit\nAugust is now well underway, and that means were are mere weeks out from the launch of the exciting-looking JRPG Soul Hackers 2. Publisher Atlus has dropped a brand new trailer for the stylish sequel, keeping fans teetering on high fervor ahead of the game's official launch on August 26.\nThe trailer itself does not offer us any new information regarding features or mechanics, it is purely a contextless, narrative affair — its one-minute runtime packed out with more melodrama than you can shake a Sabbath at. Perhaps the one element that stands out the most in this short preview is just how damn good everybody looks. While Shin Megami Tensei is most certainly full of demon-hunting, world-ending plotlines, its various protagonists and antagonists are never too busy to ensure that they look sharp as all hell. It's quite literally a franchise trademark at this point.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYdZZLhBYYM&t\nSoul Hackers 2 will tell the story of specialized “Data Agents” Ringo and Figue, who have been dispatched to Earth to track down Persons of Interest related to an incoming apocalypse. What will follow is a lot of high-drama, social engagement, dungeon-exploring, demon-gathering, and strategic, elemental combat, all dressed up in SMT's unmistakably excessive aesthetic. Soul Hackers 2, for lack of a better phrase, simply came out of nowhere. It was only announced five months ago, and now it is just three weeks away from launch.\nAt least nobody was kept waiting... It is the end of the world, after all.\nSoul Hackers 2 launches August 26 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.\nThe post Soul Hackers 2 shows off its twisted fates and fly fashions appeared first on Destructoid.",

Indie-pop interactive series We Are OFK debuts with its first two episodes on August 18, 2022.\nThe biopic series follows the members of OFK, a virtual band looking for their big break in the Los Angeles music scene. The interactive animated series takes place over five episodes, with five interactive music videos that double as tracks performed by OFK.\nTeam OFK, the developers behind the project, includes some multifaceted talent from the gaming, TV, music, and film industries.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu2iKC4fVDs\nIn essence, it's kind of like an interactive Gorrilaz or Josie & The Pussycats narrative adventure. Episodes will have fully-voiced dialogue and texting interfaces for long-range chats. It also looks like it will have some drama, as these 20-somethings try to make it big while also dealing with heartbreak, music-making, and paying the rent.\nThe first two episodes debut on August 18, while new episodes premiere weekly afterward on August 25, September 1, and September 8. The season will ultimately be five episodes long.\nSpin the record\nFor collectors, We Are OFK is also getting a couple special physical goodies. One that makes perfect sense is a 2x vinyl, which includes OFK's singles, art prints, and some special acoustic tracks. Those acoustic versions can only be heard on the vinyl.\n\nThere's also a physical version planned for the Nintendo Switch and PS5 versions of We Are OFK, which includes all five chapters and a papercraft version of Debug the cat. I guess Stray is no longer the only cat game on the market.\n\nBoth versions arrive via iam8bit, and are currently up for order on the iam8bit site.\nWe Are OFK premieres on Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, and PC via both Steam and Epic on August 18.\nThe post Musical indie-pop story We Are OFK premieres on August 18 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Time to light up Night City\nNetflix anime series Cyberpunk: Edgerunners got a new trailer today, and it looks both gorgeous and full of action. Today's trailer lets us meet some of the main cast and see the set-up for the action, as well as how Night City is being adapted into anime form.\nAnime fans who didn't already know will probably notice right away that Studio Trigger is at the helm. Trigger is the studio behind productions like Promare and Kill la Kill, and boy, does it show in this new trailer. The fast action, berating line reads, and gorgeous style bleeds through in the new Edgerunners trailer.\nIt does, also, take some quieter moments. The story looks to follow David as he gets tied up in the back-alley gigs of Night City.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiR_lMNlJko\nAlongside an incredible adaptation of the world and design, based off the tabletop RPG, Studio Trigger also seems to be taking cues from CD Projekt Red's Cyberpunk 2077. The call tone, for instance, is the same one used in the video game. And a few of the vistas we see in the trailer are very similar to their 2077 look.\nA cyberpunk future\nNetflix has had some hits and some misses in the video game adaptation department as of late. On one hand, Castlevania is one of their big series and is currently headed into the Richter Belmont era. And League of Legends series Arcane has been absolutely stellar. But Dragon's Dogma didn't do quite as well on the animated front.\nThis is Studio Trigger, though, and I think that plus the potential of a good Cyberpunk adaptation is enough reason to tune in. There is still some Cyberpunk 2077 content on the way somewhere down the line, though CD Projekt Red seems like it's mostly moving towards The Witcher for the future. I'm very much into Trigger's take on Night City, though.\nCyberpunk: Edgerunners hits Netflix next month, in September 2022.\nThe post Cyberpunk: Edgerunners showcases some gorgeous action in new trailer appeared first on Destructoid.",

There's even denotations for tracks that have been reused, or have never appeared again in any future game (and thus would be more ideal for preservation in Deluxe).\nIt's interesting seeing everything broken down game by game. It feels like there should be more Super Mario Kart/SNES tracks in Deluxe, but there's only three! Nintendo better pump those numbers up eventually. I always had a feeling that Mario Kart Tour was super represented, but seeing it on paper is something else.\nBeyond that, everything seems to be pretty well spread out across the rest of the series. Maybe we could use some more Double Dash (especially since it has some unique tracks that haven't seen the light of day again)? But other than that, Nintendo has given each game a decent amount of representation.\nAs a note, the red exclamation mark (!) icon denotes tracks that were just recently confirmed to be part of \"Wave 2\" of the Booster Course [Season] Pass. We have four more waves to get to by the end of 2023, so there's plenty on the way.\nMario Kart 8 Deluxe track list (including what hasn't made it in yet):\n\nThe post A Mario Kart 8 Deluxe community member made a handy list of every past Mario Kart track that is and isn’t in Deluxe yet appeared first on Destructoid.",

While I've been resigned to a life without the newest console due to bots, scalpers, and other customers that have faster internet than me, it seems there might finally be hope for those of us who still don't have a console.\nAccording to a new financial report from Sony published on July 29, they have plans to reach their projection of 18 million units sold in 2022. There was also a detail included in the report that there have been \"significant improvements\" to Sony's supply chain, meaning the issues that have been plaguing the PS5's production may well be coming to a close. Most importantly, the company said that they're \"working to bring-forward more supply into the year-end holiday selling season.\"\nSounds like it should be smooth(er) sailing for consumers as the months go on.\n\nI've even heard anecdotes recently of the PS5 not selling out instantly once it becomes available through Sony, so there's a chance we're already seeing the positive effects of supply chain improvements.\nI personally gave up the search a long time ago, mostly because there aren't a ton of games out there I've been itching to play that have been released just yet, but I'd be lying if I said I wouldn't jump at the chance to play Returnal or Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart if given the chance. It's like, my backlog is big enough I don't need to play those games right now, but I'd like to, you know?\nAnyway, it's pretty heartening to hear I won't have to panic my way through a PS5 purchase in the coming months.

They even have a full page dedicated to folding and cutting! If you're game for a crafting project that requires identifying \"mountain fold lines and valley fold lines\" you're set this afternoon. As an added bonus: Thankfully, Nintendo has crafted the booklets to ensure they can both be stored in the actual Mario Strikers: Battle League case.\nIf only you could order physical manuals for every first-party Nintendo game\nI get wanting to cut down on environmental footprints, but providing a \"print on demand\" service for manuals sounds like a really interesting potential market opportunity.

          "description": "Herschel \"Guy\" Beahm IV, known by most as Dr. Disrespect, helped form a \"AAA game studio\" with former Call of Duty and Halo developers in December of last year. Dubbed Midnight Society, the studio's first project was slated to be a multiplayer shooter. More details about it have been released, including word that it's a PvPvE extraction shooter. \nNow, Midnight Society's first game has a name – Deadrop – and gameplay footage. This gameplay comes from players who had (very) early access to the title, so it's less of a demo or vertical slice of gameplay and more of a proof of concept. Check it out for yourself in the tweets below from Okami Games. \nHere's another gameplay clip in a different firing range. #DEADROP pic.twitter.com/odT5QHYtFp\nJuly 30, 2022\nOne more clip showing the outdoor areas and world design.\n@oOStep_Oo for the clips, go give him a follow!#DEADROP pic.twitter.com/5XGN5uPSxx\nJuly 30, 2022\nAs you can see, the gameplay as it stands today consists of a firing range with a single weapon. You can catch glimpses of the world design, too, and it looks somewhat cyberpunk-y. Only time will tell what the final product will look like, as all signs point to this game being years away from release. \nThe reception to the gameplay has been less than great, to say the least. It doesn't help that Beahm tweeted, \"I can take a screenshot right now...blows out anything from the [Call of Duty] engine\" back in June because this game does not appear to stack up against Call of Duty's visuals. Perhaps it will one day, but that remains to be seen. \nWhat do you think of Deadrop's gameplay? Let us know in the comments below!",

However, it wasn't the massive generation-defining game CD Projekt Red (and admittedly, many of us fans) propped it up to be. \nI played it on Xbox Series X at release, and it ran fine enough that I could roll credits thinking I had just completed a fun game that I'm glad I played. However, getting an Xbox Series X or a PlayStation 5 around the time Cyberpunk 2077 was released in 2020 was challenging, and many had to play CDPR's latest RPG on last-gen consoles. You probably already know the story of how that went – it was not a good game to play on last-gen consoles at all.

          "description": "The PlayStation 5 has been the current Sony console for just under two years, having been released on November 12, 2020, in the U.S. At launch, there were a number of new features associated with the console such as Game Help cards, Activity Cards, and several others. \nOne of those new features was the Accolades system. If you’re like me, you didn’t know this feature existed before it made its way into headlines today. As for why it’s in headlines, it’s because the launch feature is being discontinued in “the fall of 2022,” according to Sony. \n“In fall of 2022, the Accolades feature on PlayStation 5 will no longer be supported,” an update from Sony reads. “The feature hasn’t seen the level of usage we anticipated, so we are refocusing our efforts. We encourage the community to continue to send positive messages to one another.” \nIf you’re curious about what Accolades was in light of its forthcoming discontinuation, it allowed players to give accolades and positive encouragement to other players they came across online. You could give another player a Helpful, Welcoming, or Good Sport accolade based on what it was like playing with them. You were allowed to give one accolade per match and you could only give them to players who weren’t your friends. As for why, well, Sony kept track of your accolades and other players could view them. \nYou’ve now only got a few months (maybe even less) to secure as many of these accolades as possible or you could just ignore the feature, which is probably what you’ve been doing the past two years (whether you knew it or not).\nIn the meantime, read our thoughts on the latest PlayStation exclusive game in Game Informer’s Stray review. \nHave you ever used the PS5 Accolades feature?

          "description": "Our brief first look at NBA 2K23's on-court action shows off the fluidity of play and attention to detail that unfolds even after the whistle is blown. For years, this series has been lauded as a graphical powerhouse, and this teaser sizzles in this way.\nWe'll have to see how the footage shown breaks down as far as new gameplay features, but it would appear perimeter play is getting some of the spotlight this year. The realism in the superstars is also on display, both on the court and in how they celebrate and interact with fans.\nNBA 2K23 will have three different looks on retail stands with NBA Legend Michael Jordan on one cover, Phoenix's Devin Booker on another, and the WNBA's Sue Bird and Diana Taurasi on the third. Michael Jordan's return unfolds through 15 different Jordan Challenge scenarios that recreate key moments from his career.\nMore details should be coming soon, as 2K Sports aims to ship NBA 2K23 on September 9 for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.",

          "description": "\"A new chapter is about to begin amidst a tangled web of factions.\" This line accompanies the latest teaser trailer for Genshin Impact, the incredible free-to-play RPG from miHoYo. The trailer dives into the game's fourth region, Sumeru, which is home to people who can't dream and worship the God of Wisdom.\nSuermu looks lush in foliage, with mushroom creatures scurrying about the trunks of sizable trees. It also contains a desert area and looks to be just as sizable as the game's other areas.\nThe trailer also introduces a host of companion characters that players will meet as quests are completed. The first new character is Tighnari, a forest watcher who we see holding a magical firefly. In Port Ormos, players will run into Alhaitham from the Haravatat in the Akademiya. Further into the game, players meet Dehya of the Desertfolk, who is also a mercenary for the Emerites. There are also Nilou, a character who is pursuing art and dance, Nahida, a mysterious being, and Cyno, the General Mahamatra.\nAll of this content is a part of Genshin Impact's 03 update, which doesn't have a release date yet, but appears to be close, given how much miHoYo has revealed. Genshin Impact is currently available on PlayStation consoles and PC, and works just as well on Android, and iOS.\nAre you still invested in Genshin Impact? If so, what do you hope to see from the new update?",

Players control an investigative reporter guided by a mysterious voice over the radio to explore abandoned Japanese facilities nestled within an island forest teeming with prehistoric wildlife. These dinos are highly intelligent and realistically behave like animals, featuring what Great Ape describes as self-preservation and reactive systemic AI behaviors. \n\n\nPlayers can use stealth to avoid detection while exploring, create distractions, or repel dinos using items like flares and makeshift, non-lethal weaponry. You’ll spend much of the game scrounging for materials as you traverse ruins for clues about the island’s history and how you ended up in this dire situation. \nAccording to the game’s FAQ, The Lost Wild won’t be arriving until late 2024 or early 2025. It has been confirmed for PC via Steam but will also come to unspecified consoles.",

          "description": "Thirsty Suitors kicked off the Annapurna Showcase with a new gameplay explainer breaking down its uniquely presented battle system and a surprising exploration segment. \nThe game, which premiered during last year's Game Awards, centers on Jala, a young woman who must reconcile with her exes and friends while dealing with ( or, more specifically, disappointing ) her demanding parents before her sister's wedding. The game revolves around a turn-based battle system where Jala faces a former lover, which reimagines their attempts to find common ground as an RPG battle.\n\n\nThe trailer showed off moves such as Thirsty Taunts to manipulate an ex's emotions. Your old flames can manifest their inflated egos into alternate realities, where they reign supreme as the exaggerated versions of their self-perceptions. Thankfully, you knock them down a peg by enlisting the help of family members as if they were Final Fantasy summons, such as a giant version of Jala's mother dishing out significant damage. Battles conclude not with a knockout but with Jala and her adversary working out their issues.\nThirst Suitors features a variety of gameplay mechanics outside of battles, namely skateboarding. Certain segments allow Jala to skate and grind rails, build combos, and execute stunts to build up a score. It's a surprising addition that harkens to Tony Hawk or Jet Set Radio, and the game also features other unique gameplay shifts. \nA Steam demo goes live later today if you're still on the fence about Thirsty Suitors. The game has only been confirmed for PC so far and has no release window.",

          "description": "The Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake, teased initially with a brief trailer back in 2021, is reportedly on indefinite development hold. That’s the news as reported by Bloomberg earlier today, which cited unnamed sources close to its development, relaying that the project has been paused.\nThe problems reportedly stem from major staff departures at developer, Aspyr Media. Specifically, both the art director and the design director were unexpectedly let go from the company. A recent vertical slice demo of the game was well received by license holders. However, later messaging to the rest of the development team suggested that the project wasn’t where studio leadership wanted it to be.\nDevelopers at Aspyr are reportedly now stating that 2025 would be a realistic time frame to expect the project to release. \nStar Wars: Knights of the Old Republic holds a special place in video game history. The original 2003 game was a significant milestone in successful and original video game storytelling in the Star Wars franchise and featured a memorable twist regarding a main character’s identity. The game also helped popularize some of the choice-driven and moral decision-making that became so popular in later games like Mass Effect.\nThe remake is highly anticipated by longtime fans, but its future now appears murky.\n[Source: Bloomberg]",

At that point, Skull and Bones was a 5v5 multiplayer arena battler where you played solely as the ship. It wasn't exactly the Black Flag follow-up many, including myself, had anticipated, but with Ubisoft Singapore, the studio behind the Assassin's Creed franchise's excellent naval combat, at the helm, I wanted to see more. \nAfter another look at it in 2018, Skull and Bones went dark, and Ubisoft remained mostly silent on the title for years. Then, this month, the publisher announced that it would be re-revealing Skull and Bones on July 7. That return brought with it a brand new look at gameplay and new details about ho…",

You can pick up a set that includes a “you can’t see me” emote, WWE Championship Title Back Bling, and Five Digit Slapper pickaxe. Personally, I’m chuckling at the idea of the PG-friendly Cena adjusting attitudes with guns instead of bodyslams. \nWhile Cena isn’t the first wrestler to appear in Fornite – Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson has him beat there – it’s cool to see regardless, and, as a wrestling fan, I hope this trend continues. Fortnite already acts as the ultimate “forbidden door” for various media properties, so let's throw more sports entertainment into the mix by adding stars from WWE, AEW, Impact, New Japan, and other promotions. That would certainly entice me to dive back into action. \nDo you plan on chasing victory royales as Big Match John? Let us know in the comments!",

          "description": "Sony released a PlayStation Blog post fleshing out some of the new features for its upcoming PlayStation VR2 headset. \nPS VR2 now sports a see-through view. By hitting a button or using the Card in the Control Center, you can disable game footage and see your surroundings without removing the headset. This is thanks to the device’s embedded front cameras, making it less of a hassle when you need to check on something in the real world. Sony also notes that this mode is for viewing only; you can’t use it to record. You can, however, broadcast yourself while playing PS VR2 games by connecting a PS5 HD camera to the consoles. \nThe play area, as in the virtual boundaries allotted for VR play, can now be customized. You can use the headset cameras and Sense controllers to scan the room and dynamically map out the play space to your liking. These settings are then saved until you move to a different play area. \nLastly, PS VR2 sports two viewing modes: VR and Cinematic. VR mode displays VR content in a 360 degree view in 4000 x 2040 HDR video format (2000 x 2040 per eye) and 90Hz/120Hz frame rate. Cinematic Mode lets players view non-VR media and the PS5 interface in 1920×1080 HDR video format with 24/60Hz and 120Hz frame rate.\nPlayStation VR2 still doesn’t have a release window, but Sony promises to share more information “soon.” That includes its launch line-up, which is said to consist of at least 20 games. Titles being developed for the headset include Horizon: Call of the Mountain, ports of Resident Evil Village and No Man’s Sky, and The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners Ch. 2.\nWhat do you think of these features for PlayStation VR2?

Years after seeing the action JRPG’s numerous endings and earning the platinum trophy, I never expected to miss out on so many well-kept mysteries. However, an Automata player recently discovered a secret room leaving hardcore dataminers baffled and excited. \nSomeone randomly posted a video on the Nier Automata subreddit showing they found a secret room in the Copied City. So far no one else has worked out how they managed to make this secret door appear. Literally 1 person on earth has accessed this room and we are uttered mind blown pic.twitter.com/g7W4JxiNDg\nJuly 25, 2022\nRandomly uploaded to Reddit by user sadfutago (thanks, Eurogamer!), the video in the tweet above shows them sprinting past droids in the Copied City and interacting with an inconspicuous section of the back wall. After sliding down a ladder and whooshing through distorted corridors, sadfutago enters a \"holy\" site. I'll let you see what that is for yourself.  There are unimportant items along the way, and there's not much to do other than look around. Still, the community is shocked that something of this nature remained hidden for so long. \nFamed dataminer Lance McDonald – you might remember them as the player who unearthed Automata's best-kept secret – spoke for everyone when they said, \"So far no one else has worked out how [sadfutago] managed to make this secret door appear. Literally 1 person on earth has accessed this room and we are utterly mind blown.\" McDonald also said that it's impossible to mod the game this way, refuting the claims of swaths of naysayers. \nIs this an area Platinum Games intended, or is it a ruse designed and implemented by players?

According to The Verge, the cold boot-up time is now estimated to be around 5 seconds. The trick to the faster time lies in a shorter animation. \nCan confirm - worked with @harrisonhoffman and @jakerose27 to create a shorter boot up animation (~4s) from the original boot up animation (~9s), helping to reduce the overall startup time.\nJuly 23, 2022\nThe director of Integrated Marketing at Xbox stated (see above) worked alongside the principal product manager for connected TV apps, Harrison Hoffman, and senior product manager lead Jake Rosenberg to “create a shorter boot up animation (~4s) from the original boot up animation (~9s), helping to reduce the overall startup time.” However, there is a catch. You’ll have to set your Series X/S to Energy Saver mode to benefit from the faster boot-up. This means the console will completely power off when you decide to put the controller down and do something else. Nevertheless, this benefits the environment and helps drop the monetary load of electricity bills. \nUltimately, the boot-up is down from 20 seconds to 15 seconds. That might seem negligible at first glance, but perhaps we’ll reach a period when wait times are nonexistent. \n[Source: The Verge]",

The wyvern can cloak to evade its attackers and spin within the blink of an eye to knock them back.\nIn our review for Sunbreak, John Carson said the game needs more threats. \"The lack of new monsters plagues the early hours, but there’s plenty to love if you keep at it,\" he wrote. \"The added flexibility of the Switch Skill Swap system is a freeing and fun expansion to combat for hardcore hunters and the new creatures in the Master Rank quests – when you get to them – breathe life into the experience.

          "description": "Funko, the collectibles manufacturer behind the wildly popular Pop line of toys, is partnering with 10:10 games to create a \"AAA action platformer\" for console and PC. The game is slated to release in 2023 and is spearheaded by video game developer veterans  Jon Burton and Arthur Parsons, who worked together on several Lego games at Traveller's Tales and are now at 10:10 Games.\n“Creating iconic products that emotionally connect fans to their favorite fandoms is critical to each product portfolio decision,” said Andrew Perlmutter, CEO of Funko. “By partnering with 10:10 Games and utilizing the best creators in the business, we will have the talent to deliver games that reflect Funko’s unique look and feel across its lines and varied products.”\nThis quote implies Funko's stylistic characters with large heads and black eyes could be used for the game. Given the developers' track record of making games that feature hundreds of playable characters, it's not unreasonable to think this title may unite many popular brands that have gotten the Funko treatment. For now, all we have is a teaser trailer, which you can view above.",

The game doesn't have a release date yet and was only shown once in a trailer, but will soon get its first action figure. Hasbro just revealed a six-inch Black Series action figure for the KX Security Droid, which will make its debut in the sequel game.\n\nThe Security Droids were a big threat in Fallen Order and look even more imposing now with a weapon that appears to be fuel-based. The tank on the droid's back has to be a weak spot.

As you explore the post-apocalyptic world, have you given it one yourself? If so, what name have you settled on? \nAdmittedly, I’m still figuring that out myself. I still have a good ways to go in Stray, and I’ve batted around a few options as I hopped across rooftops and meowed at robots. Some are more elaborate, like \"Chester A. Tabby II\" (the successor to my Palico’s name in Monster Hunter: World); others are more simple, like “Creamsicle,\" which has been growing on me. I’m hoping your responses inspire me to concoct the purr-fect moniker. I'm sorry. \nSo let’s hear it: what do you call the cat in Stray? There are no wrong answers. Well, unless you named it “Dog.” Then we’ll have to snitch on you to the Cat Police. The Cats-apo?

He’ll be rocking his portal gun and can summon Meeseeks, among other zany abilities. Morty joins him during the season, but his arrival date has not yet been confirmed. The young sidekick focuses on using projectiles such as grenade weapons, and he can whip himself at targets. \nThe MultiVersus open beta begins July 26 and will be available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC.

          "description": "A not-so-long time ago in the same galaxy we all reside in, Respawn Entertainment deviated from its first-person shooter roots to create Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66. After he’s outed by the Sith, he embarks on a quest to recover an artifact capable of locating force-sensitive children while also avoiding capture by the Inquisitors, who are elite Jedi hunters. \nThe game features a blend of lightsaber combat and a suite of Force abilities. Borrowing inspiration from FromSoftware’s Soul series, encounters are challenging, requiring a strategic blend of blocks and parries to outduel opponents. Meanwhile, the various planets take on a Metroid-inspired progression with players unlocking abilities to backtrack to previously inaccessible areas. \nWatch on Twitch!\nFallen Order was released on November 15, 2019, and was a critical and financial success. It also served as a saving grace for single-player fans, providing proof to an increasingly multiplayer-focused EA that linear story-driven experiences can still make the big bucks. With a sequel reportedly in the works, we’re revisiting this gem of the Star Wars video game pantheon. \nJoin Marcus Stewart, Andrew Reiner, and, making his Replay debut, GI web designer/programmer Jon Woodey on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central as we journey through the entirety of Cal Kestis’ adventure. Expect plenty of laughs, deaths, and general nerding out over all things Star Wars. We encourage you to hang out with us in chat.

          "description": "Resident Evil Village Gold Edition arrives in October and introduces the Winters’ story expansion. This content update includes an expanded version of the game’s Mercenaries mode, introducing Chris Redfield, Karl Heisenberg, and Lady Dimitrescu as playable characters. A new trailer shows off each of their abilities and how players can tear through hordes of monstrosities as this powerful trio. \n\n\nThe update, called The Mercenaries Additional Orders, adds two new stages, Bloody Village and Bloody River, and lets players mow down adversaries such as the weapon-strapped Chris Redfield. When his arsenal of guns isn’t enough, the former BSAA agent packs a powerful punch that can have foes reeling, and activating his Onslaught gauge grants him an absurd speed boost, letting him move and reload in the blink of an eye. When all else fails, Chris can call in support strikes by pinpointing targets with his locator. \nIf you want to get your Magneto on, Heisenberg can use his electromagnetic powers to toss buzzsaws and other objects, channel lightning, and smash foes with his massive hammer. He can also call in his Soldat Jets to lend a hand. \nThe towering Lady D handles threats by slicing them to bits with her intimidating claws, which builds up a Thrill meter. Spending this meter allows her to use special moves such as summoning her psychotic daughters. Hilariously, the trailer even shows Dimitrescu tossing her bedroom dresser at a mob, a goofy callback to when she destroyed the same piece of furniture during the main campaign. \nIf you already own Resident Evil Village, you can purchase the Winter’s Expansion standalone to access the new Mercenaries content. Resident Evil Village Gold Edition is an all-in-one package that includes the base game and the expansion. Both will launch on October 28.",
