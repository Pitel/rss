Watching Goku chase after Doctor Strange with a lightsaber never gets old.\nWith Halloween creeping up on us, it opens the door for some really fun crossovers, and this year sees Ash Williams from Sam Raimi's cult horror hit The Evil Dead make the cut. The character, played by Bruce Campbell in the films, gets his own skin. And @FireWalkWithJoe on Twitter has found that there's a really fun Easter egg if you come across either Spider-Gwen or Spider-Man in the game wearing Ash's skin.

While there have been the occasional RPGs like Kakarot or The Legacy of Goku thrown into the mix, most have been firmly focused on fighting your way across the series’ story. However, Dragon Ball: The Breakers has the guts to do something completely different. It doesn’t always hit the right notes but it is unique enough that fans of the anime and manga will be thrilled for at least several hours\nInstead of battling it out against some of the most iconic villains in anime history, you are given a taste of how nightmarish it would be to live as a normal person in the Dragon Ball universe. This is an asymmetrical 7v1 survival game remarkably similar to the likes of Dead by Daylight or Friday the 13th: The Game. In fact, there is very little in The Breakers that tries to change or advance the formula presented in these titles other than offering a more colourful aesthetic and cartoonish atmosphere.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

These two have lived through more danger and trauma than anyone should have in a thousand lifetimes, and after the first game’s sort-of happy-ish ending, it got me thinking: when will these kids ever catch a break?\nTurns out the answer is never.

At the time, there were no streaming links available, but in setting their YouTube page live this morning, Konami jumped the gun and included some of the game names being revealed.

          "description": "Is it just me, or did Persona 5 never feel quite at home on the PlayStation 4? Sure, it looked gorgeous on a big TV, its bright colours popping all over your living room, but it always felt bit wrong to me. I think it's all about pacing. Persona 5's blend of turn-based combat and life sim elements hardly moves at a breakneck speed. There's a lot of reading. A lot of listening to your pals chat about their hopes and fears. A lot of pressing one button to progress a line of dialogue onto the next. Shoving that on your 65\" 4K TV always seemed a bit overkill.\r\n\n\r\nBasically, I never got into Persona 5 when it first launched on PS4. I played about three hours of it and then binned it off in favour of something else. In 2020, during a moment of first-lockdown madness, I bought Persona 5 Royal for full price, thinking maybe my issue with the original release was that there wasn't enough of it, but surprisingly discovered it still wasn't for me. At this point, I'd invested £100 into my \"Do I like Persona 5?\" experiment and was quickly realising the result was a pretty firm \"No, mate, you don't\". So when I sat down with the PC version of the game on the Steam Deck to test it out, I figured I'd play it for a few hours and then never touch it again. I was wrong. I was so very wrong.\n\n \nRead more",

Since its updated and expanded Royal version dropped on PlayStation some years later, I've been afraid to make my return. You'd think I'd be itching to delve back into what's essentially the definitive version of the Phantom Thieves' adventure, and yet it's precisely because it blew me away the first time that I've been reluctant to go back.\nNow? Now I feel silly. After playing the early portions of Persona 5: Royal, which finds itself coming to practically every remaining platform this week, including PC, my goodness me, it's wonderful to be back in Shibuya with the gang. Already it's the Persona 5 I adored, with new cutscenes and pacing adjustments to make it – somehow – even better. Have you never played Persona before? Good! Let me twist your arm.

Existing default picks Steve and Alex are going to be joined by seven new characters who reflect the wider world, although Mojang wouldn’t reveal any more about them ahead of today's Minecraft Live stream. Not even their names, alas. I was going to suggest Pugh, Pugh, Barney McGrew, Cuthbert, Dibble and Grub, but then realised that leaves one short. Gandalf, maybe?\r\n\n \nRead more",

Unfortunately, while on a deep sea dive to retrieve the tapes of episodes 13 and 14 (an expedition funded by supporters; your generosity is always appreciated), my ship was attacked by a large and unusually toothsome whale-like creature. The cursed thing took a huge bite out of the side of our noble vessel, The Squiggled Egg, and we were forced to abandon ship. It was only by the grace of the botswain Hughbert Threads that I'm alive to write this post today, as the man gave his life beating back the foul beast, giving a large part of the rest of the crew time to get away. Alas, in the confusion, I only secured episode 14, and episode 13 is now lost to time. That is definitely what happened, and not that the digital recording got mangled somehow.\nStill, episode 14 (which is now episode 13, even though I say 14 in the recording) is now here for you to enjoy. It's all about bad and obsolete palaeontology - the weird ways people in history interpreted fossils, and why.\nRead more",

At some point there'll be a two hour YouTube video outlining how it has a clear and nuanced plot, or that it's a metaphor for periods and erections, or both. In the immediate, it's about slithering out of a pod, staggering through the desert, and finding yourself in a strange, huge rotting machine made of rock and flesh that's already decades into abandonment and decay, and where most things look a bit penisy or womby. It's about the lizardy parasite latched to your back gradually transforming your body. It's about grim squishy noises and survival.\nScorn doesn't have dialogue, or a map. It doesn't really have a HUD, it doesn't have quest markers, and your character will not, upon seeing a strange new device, say something like \"Hmm... seems like a key. Maybe if I find the two missing ones, it'll open up a way forward!\" out loud. It won't even pull focus to the corridor you should check next.

          "description": "The Ryzen 7 5800X was a great gaming CPU when it launched in 2020, and it remains one of the fastest options going despite the recent release of Ryzen 7000 processors late last month. The 5800X also has two major advantages: it works on a wide range of cheap motherboards with DDR4 RAM, and it's way cheaper than the 7700X - especially when it's discounted on Ebay US, as is the case today!\nSo: let's cut to the chase. The 5800X is down to $229.99 at Ebay, from a list price of $449, meaning it's nearly 50% off. That also makes it $170 cheaper than the equivalent Ryzen 7000 processor, the $400 eight-core Ryzen 7700X. Or, to put it another way, you're paying around 60% of the price for at least 80% of the gaming performance of that newer CPU - not bad, given that you'll also pay way less for a complete Ryzen 5000 system (with AM4 motherboards and DDR4) than a complete Ryzen 7000 one (with AM5 motherboards and DDR5). \nRead more",

          "description": "Detective games are often about filling in the blanks. A terrible crime will sit at the heart of them, yes, but most take place in the days and weeks that follow, where the bulk of your time is spent gathering clues and building a case to work out whodunnit. Rarely do you get to glimpse the immediate aftermath of the crime itself, where all the major suspects are still in play and their pockets are stuffed with incriminating evidence they'll no doubt be disposing of in the coming minutes. \nThe prime exception to this rule is Lucas Pope's Return Of The Obra Dinn, which gives you a time-travelling pocket watch to revisit the scenes of its many, many murders and work out exactly what happened to its 60-strong passenger list on its titular, ill-fated ship. Frogwares' Sherlock Holmes games and their mind palace visualisation techniques also warrant a mention here, and maybe even Outer Wilds at a push, if you count its 22-minute timeloop as an investigation scene several millennia in the making. But it's Obra Dinn that Color Gray Games emulate most strongly with their impressive debut in The Case Of The Golden Idol, which gives you a series of 12 murders to solve, each of which is presented as a freeze-frame vignette at the moment of death. You're still filling in blanks here, slotting names, objects and eventually verbs in its various scene scrolls to deduce whodunnit and howtheydunit, but this intriguing tale of 18th century high (and a secret) society, betrayals, backstabbing and murder most foul is a mystery game for the ages. \nRead more",

The way she wanted to organise keys wasn't what the game thought was the right way, and her article examined this frustration; she described the canonical correct solution as being that of a \"domestic Joker\".\nThe developers at Max Inferno Studios read this article and decided that, you know what? Alice0 was on to something. They contacted us to let us know that her piece was the inspiration for adding a feature called Let It Be, a skip puzzle function that you can access at any time. Anne Macmillan, who's a co-founder of Max Inferno Studios as well as artist and animator for A Little To The Left, was kind enough to talk to me about it.\nRead more",

Speaking of, today is the last day of the Amazon Prime Early Access Sale, which has the 1TB Blue SN570 down to £65.\nThat’s not quite its lowest price ever, but it does match its flash sale pricing during Prime Day back in July. And is an utter pittance for a 1TB NVMe SSD, let alone one that’s actually quite speedy. Amazon UK also have the 2TB version on sale for £128, just £1 more than its lowest dip on record (Prime Day 2022 again, as it happens). These prices are only available to Prime members, but the Blue SN570 ranks highly among the best SSDs for gaming, so they're well deserving of your cash if you’re in need of PC storage improvements.\nRead more",

          "description": "I picked up the Romancelvania demo at Steam Next Fest on Alice Bee's recommendation, and she was quite correct when she described it as \"extremely relevant to [my] interests\". So relevant, in fact, that I'm starting to wonder if this wasn't an attempt at psychological sabotage disguised as a friendly gesture. (You wouldn't do that to me, would you, Alice?)\nRomancelvania is exactly what it sounds like: dating sim meets Castlevania. No idea how I missed it during my own perusal of the demo list, because unsurprisingly it's immediately become my favourite thing I've ever played at a Steam Next Fest. I was so drawn in, in fact, that I've been having a tough time putting it down, even when I really need to — hence my suspicion that this was some sort of test on Alice's part. No idea if I've succeeded or failed.\nThe demo starts on a promising note, awakening you in the persona of a comically brooding and exaggeratedly shirtless hunky Dracula. (The final game will include the option to play as a Lady Drac, if you prefer, who will not be shirtless, but not by a large margin.)\n Read more",

          "description": "Coral Island  self-describes as a \"reimagining of farming games\", but if we're being real it doesn't reimagine the Stardew Valley template totally differently. The titular island, and your overgrown plot of farmland on it, has almost the same layout as Stardew Valley, and the tasks you do - growing stuff, keeping animals, making friends with locals, exploring a mine five levels at a time, and appeasing local spirits by giving them bundles of different crops - will also be very familiar to any DewHeads (that's what we call ourselves).\nThat's not to say Coral Island isn't good. It's all in very beautiful bouncy 3D, for one thing, and I found the island setting (which impacts the flora, fauna, and architecture in general) made everything feel less like work. Combined with a thread of environmentalism weaving through the game, and the fact that Coral Island is slightly easier than Stardew Valley, and you feel like you're doing more progress in less time. If you loved the vibe of ConcernedApe's smash hit, but found the need to hand-write your own almanac a bit intimidating, this is the game for you.\nRead more",

          "description": "The fog is lifting...\nLater today, Konami will take to the digital stage for a special presentation focusing on future releases in the MIA horror series, Silent Hill — Bafflingly, however, the YouTube channel prepped for this afternoon's \"Silent Hill Transmission\" already contains code seemingly identifying several as-yet-unannounced entries.\nPossible spoilers — direct from the developer itself, mind — follow.\nFirstly, the YouTube channel description blurb includes a placeholder for \"Silent Hill 2\" on the PlayStation Store, suggesting a pre-order link for a potential remaster/remake. In addition, digging into the site's address bar and embed code has lifted the lid on an array of mysterious terms, all of which may or may not relate to one, or numerous, new entries. You wait years for a new Silent Hill etc... etc...\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRvRWBQNrSI\nAmong the titles discovered in the embed code are \"Silent Hill\", \"Silent Hill 2\", \"Silent Hill F\", and \"Silent Hill: Ascension\". At a guess, this would suggest that Konami's stream may include the reveal of a brand new entry — Silent Hill: Ascension — as well as the announcement of the aforementioned remake/remaster of Silent Hill 2. The 2001 release is very much a fan-favorite in the series' spooky canon of releases and, as such, a prime candidate to make a grand return on modern platforms.\nAs for the identity of \"Silent Hill F\", this could just be a mere placeholder. I'm willing to bet that it stands for \"Silent Hill: Frogger\" — a sure thing given that Konami also owns that classic, road-crossing IP.\nThe truth will out this evening, when Konami finally takes to the airwaves for its Silent Hill Transmission stream. You can check out the news for yourself at 14:00 PT / 17:00 ET / 23:00 BST, and we'll be sure to bring you up to spend on all the gory details right here on Destructoid... Just try to look surprised, ok?\nThe post Silent Hill Transmission YouTube page seemingly leaks new titles appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "(Not the ones hanging around the daughters of Dimitrescu)\nCapcom has informed fans that it is currently working on a fix for a fistful of serious bugs that are currently infesting the Steam edition of Resident Evil Village — Speaking on Twitter, the studio has assured players that a fix for the plague of issues is currently in the works.\nThe troublesome bugs appeared following the release of the Steam/PC edition's latest patch, which launched in-game on October 10.  Since its arrival, some Resident Evil Village players have found that the survival horror adventure either gets stucks in a restart loop, refuses to accept version compatibility while loading, or simply fails to boot entirely.  This is, no doubt, a very frustrating experience, especially for those currently picking through the game ahead of the incoming Winters' Expansion DLC.\nhttps://twitter.com/RE_Games/status/1582022175426375681?s=20&t=mhfHULksgj1vUm5V6kIu_A\nIt has been suggested by tinkerers that the crash is caused by code that stops the game dead should it find any anomalies in Village's main body of code. Readers will likely recall that the Steam edition of Resident Evil Village has had a particularly brutal run, hampered by performance issues attributed to the game's intensive anti-piracy software. While it has not been officially confirmed that this new issue is caused by a fearful code-tampering measure, it would be most eye-rolling to discover that players have once again gotten the shaft due to Capcom's paranoic attitude towards piracy.\nRegardless, a fix is en route, so players only need hold their horses for now.\nIn related news, Capcom will host a special Resident Evil Showcase tomorrow, October 20. The stream is expected to feature new trailers, updates, and details pertaining to Resident Evil Village: Gold Edition, the Winters' Expansion DLC, and the highly anticipated remake of Resident Evil 4.\nThe post Capcom working on game-breaking Resident Evil Village Steam bugs appeared first on Destructoid.",

Every aspect of the game is incredibly well-thought out, from the art to the gameplay to the enemies. Bandai Namco, however, seems especially proud of the music from Elden Ring, because they're hosting a special jazz concert to showcase some of the most popular songs and \"recognizable melodies from the game's soundtrack.\nThe event is called Elden Ring: A Night In The Lands Between, and will be for one night only on December 3 at The Bourbon Room in Los Angeles. The iconic melodies will be performed by musicians led by award-winning saxophonist Kenny Garrett, as well as jazz upcomer and trumpeter Takuya Kuroda. Tickets are on sale now for the in-person event, ranging anywhere from $75, known as the \"Tarnished\" tier, to the $200 \"Elden Lord tier that also gets you a poster, a t-shirt, dinner, and VIP seating. If you're unable to make it, you can also get access to a livestream of the event for $25, or to a VOD available after the concert for $15 -- the catch is that the stream is only available to fans in the United States.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1LwS0UHJnA\nIt seems that video game concerts are becoming more and more popular these days, and as a fan of live music, I hope they keep it up. Playing games can be something of an isolating hobby, so the idea of getting out and appreciating music we know and love played by insanely talented musicians is absolutely an idea I can get behind. Given that Elden Ring's soundtrack is so orchestral, I'll be interested to see what it would sound like with a jazz spin as well. Here's hoping that game studios keep up the live music thing in the future, because making live music a more accessible activity is a win for everyone.\nThe post Elden Ring’s music gets a jazzy new twist at an upcoming concert from Bandai Namco appeared first on Destructoid.",

There's the ability to change patterns, colors, and shapes as players decorate and build in-game.\n\nCollaboration seems to be a big focal point for this new Sims. Players will be able to play solo or collaborate with each other, and will be able to play across supported supported devices.\nNo more information was given, as it sounds like Project Rene is still a ways out. Maxis says it will continue to share more information on development as it goes along.\nA new world of Sims\nAs for currently available Sims products, today marks the launch of The Sims 4 base game as a free-to-play title. Players can now jump in on PC, Mac, PlayStation, and Xbox consoles.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIBBm7tWs_U\nMore is in store, too.

Some early expansion content was also teased in today's stream, and the team confirms that infants will be arriving in early 2023.\nThe Sims is also partnering with Overwolf for an official mod destination in CurseForge.

Each jacket features a color scheme typified by the character, with a full backprint showcasing the fighter in action. Somewhat anachronistically, the jackets are also emblazoned with an embroidered Street Fighter V logo, right on the cusp of Street Fighter 6's vaunted release.\nhttps://twitter.com/NERDSClothingCo/status/1582068026777563136?s=20&t=BuudnLBe7wEwNUhezKmeLw\nI'm obviously a dedicated and dyed-in-the-wool Street Fighter disciple, but it's not in my build or age range to rock one of these bad boys.  Perhaps, however, they are more in keeping with your own sense of style and fashion.  If so, then you can check out the entire range over on the official NERDS Clothing website, where the jackets are available to order for $125 USD each (not including shipping costs).\n(Edit: Since this article was published, all jackets — along with a range of new shirts — have suddenly been listed as being \"sold out\".  This is a little curious, given that they haven't even been available for a day, and the entire stock, in all eight sizes, has seemingly cleared out.

I haven’t even watched the 2016 reboot or Ghostbusters: Afterlife. It’s already been proven you can’t top the majesty of the original film. Video games are similar. Most games made off the license are okay at best and abysmal at worst.\nWhen Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed was announced, I was skeptical. I’m not typically drawn to multi-player-focused games, and anyone who touches my beloved had better have immaculate hands. This time, it’s Illfonic, makers of the Friday the 13th game. They’ve proven themselves before, even if it was sort of overshadowed by Dead by Daylight. So, as I fastened up my positron collider, I kept a stance of cautiously optimistic mixed …",

          "description": "It better make my coffee too\nSony Interactive Entertainment has finally released details on its upcoming pro controller DualSense Edge — The top-tier tech will launch for the PlayStation 5 platform in January 2023, priced at $199.99 USD.  Pre-orders will open exclusively on the PlayStation Direct store from October 25.\nThe DualSense Edge Wireless Controller is set to be Sony's premier controller for the PlayStation enthusiast. The new pad features a wide variety of customizable components and redefinable functions, ranging from trigger stop guards and replaceable thumbstick modules to programmable buttons, and save states for custom game layouts, alongside adjustable \"dead zones\" and trigger pressure.\nYou can check out the DualSense Edge's features in the trailer below.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvmmWeov68s\nAlongside its swappable thumb grips, modules, and triggers, the DualSense Edge will also feature a tough, braided USB cord complete with lock, to prevent those accidental disconnects.  The controller sports advanced Haptic Feedback technology as well as built-in audio controls for headphones and the onboard speaker.  In addition, the Edge's sleek carry case will also double as a charging dock (though it must remain wired in order to charge the controller.  It is not a battery backup device.)\nThe Sony DualSense Edge Wireless Controller will launch January 2023 at a retail price of $199.99 USD, which equates to a staggering £209.99 GBP or €239.99 EUR, half the price of the PS5 digital console itself. However, for those who take their control methods very, very seriously and their wallet very, very lightly, this affluent technology will be the most mechanically precise Sony gamepad available.\nPre-orders for the DualSense Edge Wireless Controller go live October 25 exclusively on PlayStation Direct.\nThe post DualSense Edge PS5 controller launches January 2023, priced at $199 appeared first on Destructoid.",

I guess it is ASOS, after all.  Unfortunately, the Horizon x ASOS collab is only available to those in the EU, UK, Japan, and Asia regions, but for everyone else, I would put money down on people listing these on eBay (for a higher price, but still).  At the very least, it's nice to look, and we can hope that they'll ship to the US in the future.\nYou know what awesome gaming clothing store does ship out here, though?  Insert Coin Clothing.  They've been a staple for gaming clothing for years, and their stuff is always amazing quality.\nThe post Guerrilla teamed up with ASOS for a Horizon: Forbidden West loungewear collection appeared first on Destructoid.",

There, he worked on games including Splinter Cell Blacklist, the Far Cry series, and eventually the remake of Splinter Cell.\n\"After more than 11 years at Ubisoft, it is now time for me to go on a new adventure,\" Grivel wrote on his LinkedIn page. \"11 years is a long time and summing it up in one post is quasi-impossible but I must say, I’ve been lucky. Lucky to work with so many great people over the years. Made so many friends.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HH1_ZCSf_HY\nWhile he's leaving the studio, it sounds like Grivel is not leaving the games industry. The now-former director says to \"stay tuned\" for what is next for him.\nChaos theory\nWith its director departing, it'll be interesting to see what Ubisoft is up to with the new take on Splinter Cell. The company has reportedly seen above-average turnover, some of which has been attributed to the reported-on studio culture at Ubisoft.\nThe Splinter Cell remake has quietly been in development at Ubisoft Toronto. Though we've only seen confirmation and a short teaser for it, we've heard a few details.\nThis includes that the new take on Sam Fisher's story won't be open world.

It looks like we're going to have to wait a little longer for full details on the anime's narrative and cast, but it's clear that NieR: Automata Ver1.1a is more of an adaptation of the NieR universe and its interplanetary warfare in general, rather than a direct retelling of the events depicted in Platinum's smash-selling video game series.\nNieR: Automata Ver1.1a will premiere in Japan in early 2023.  NieR: Automata is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

          "description": "Mario, Rabbids, and tactics mix well once again\nThe first Mario + Rabbids crossover was an interesting, surprising mix of ideas that you wouldn't presume would work together. But while Kingdom Battle laid out the groundwork, Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope feels like it's expanding the ideas and making something a bit more its own. And it's all the better for it.\nIt doesn't take long to get into the actual battles in Sparks of Hope. While the crew is lounging about at Peach's Castle, they're suddenly thrust into an interstellar conflict. The evil Cursa is vying for control of the galaxy. Meanwhile, Lumas are being turned Rabbid, making them into Sparks that need Mario and crew's help.\nMario, Luigi, and Peach all rejoin the starting roster, alongside their Rabbid counterparts. Down the line,…",

          "description": "Warner Bros. Games has announced Mortal Kombat: Onslaught, a mobile-exclusive Mortal Kombat experience. The game is described as a collection role-playing game where players build a roster of fighters from the Mortal Kombat universe and “unleash them in massive real-time group battles.” It’s more than just battles, though – Onslaught is also said to feature a cinematic story experience where fighters have to defeat a “dark and dangerous threat.”\nThis is not the first time Mortal Kombat has appeared on a mobile device. Mortal Kombat Mobile was released in 2015 alongside Mortal Kombat X and eventually adapted characters and features from Mortal Kombat 11 as well. Mortal Kombat Mobile has been downloaded over 150 million times since its launch, so it’s no wonder WB Games wants to release more games from the franchise.\nOctober 8 marked the series’ 30th anniversary, and Mortal Kombat: Onslaught seems to be a celebration of that. Not only is it the newest mobile game in the series, but it’s also the most recent title since the release of Mortal Kombat 11 Ultimate in 2020. As far as the future of the series is concerned outside of the mobile market, Netherrealm has been pretty quiet lately. Outside of our interview with franchise co-creator Ed Boon where he said we'd have to wait a little longer, the most recent news we’ve received has been this tweet:\nPatiently waiting for news on NRS’s next game…. pic.twitter.com/1ulQHZhnKx\nOctober 15, 2022\nMortal Kombat: Onslaught is coming out sometime in 2023.

It retains the core strategic gameplay of the original, so if you liked the first game, you’ll probably enjoy this as well. Removing the grid and having freedom of movement feels liberating, however, and is one of the big game-changers. It's interesting because this doesn't change my approach to playing a turn-based tactics game.

Konami is broadcasting a Silent Hill Transmission this week.\nThe event airs Wednesday, October 19 at 2:00 p.m. Pacific/5 p.m. Eastern.

PDThttps://t.co/8Knoq9xYsa\nOctober 16, 2022\nKonami reportedly has multiple Silent Hill projects in development at various studios, a rumor recently corroborated by Silent Hill movie director Christopher Gans. The most persistent is that Bloober Team, creators of The Medium and Layers of Fear, is remaking Silent Hill 2. Late September, it was reported that a title called Silent Hill: The Short Message had been rated in South Korea. \nThe last full-fledged Silent Hill game was 2012’s ill-recieved Book of Memories for PS Vita. Of course, there was also 2014's P.T., the formerly playable teaser for Hideo Kojima's canceled Silent Hills. \nFor years, Silent Hill fans have had to settle for rumor and innuendo in regards to what’s next for the series, so hopefully, Wednesday’s presentation rewards that patience with some exciting announcements.

          "description": "To celebrate Dead Space’s 14th anniversary, Motive Studio held a special livestream showcasing its upcoming remake of the game. The presentation featured an extended guided walkthrough showing off new gameplay footage as well as a rundown of features designed to make the game more terrifying than ever. \nThe video’s side-by-side comparisons illustrate the major differences between the original and the remake. One big change is that the Ishimura is now a seamless, interconnected ship that players can explore more freely. For example, using Isaac’s rocket thrusters to soar through areas you could only walk through before. A new system called the Intensity Spawn Director remixes necromorph spawn points, ensuring they’ll ambush veteran players in unexpected ways and, sometimes, in greater numbers. Dead Space also features improved necromorph dismemberment, new side quests designed to flesh out the supporting cast, new alternate fire modes for weapons, new puzzles, and more. \n\n\nDead Space launches on January 27 for PlayStation5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

Their name is Bellibolt, and they’re the signature partner of Iono, the newest gym leader from Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.\n\n\nIn Wednesday’s initial video, Iono introduced herself as not just a gym leader but also a streamer. She then asked her fictional followers to guess what her mystery partner Pokémon was based on a handful of details, including its type, the placement of its eyes, and the fact that it’s “so cute.” If you had trouble guessing, don't feel bad; today, we’ve learned that her partner is a new Pokémon altogether.\nNintendo and The Pokémon Company released a series of follow-up tweets, giving us new information about Bellibolt that sounds like it was pulled right from the Pokédex. One of the images reveals that they have a new ability called \"Electromorphosis,\" which allows Bellibolt to power up their next electric-type move after being hit by an attack.\nSay hello to the new EleFrog Pokémon, Bellibolt!\n#PokemonScarletViolet\nhttps://t.co/z7lNKThsDX pic.twitter.com/EUdcQcsUoA\nOctober 14, 2022\nYou'll be able to add Bellibolt to your team when Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet come to switch on November 18.

The narrative-driven sci-fi adventure will now launch in April to ensure it receives a final coat of polish.\nDeveloper Dramatic Labs announced the news on Twitter, stating it’s taking the extra time to ensure “a truly immersive Star Trek experience”. You can read the full statement below (click the image to enlarge).\nResurgence was first announced during The Game Awards 2021 and is a choice-driven adventure game that follows a similar design template to Telltale Games’ titles (Dramatic Labs consists of ex-Telltale employees). The story unfolds shortly after the events of Star Trek: The Next Generation as players control two original characters, an officer and a commander, to solve a mystery aboard the U.S.S. Resolute. The narrative and your relationships change depending on your choices, and gameplay features light combat and puzzle-solving. Resurgence is currently slated to launch on PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC. \nWe played a demo of Star Trek: Resurgence during Summer Game Fest in June, and you can read our hands-on impressions here.

Taking to the web-line and soaring across a wintery New York skyline is every bit as enthralling as it was before, and Miles develops into a fantastic hero.

The news comes a month shy of the game's one-year anniversary, having launched for iOS and Android in November 2021. \nSquare Enix states that it feels it hasn’t delivered the experience it aimed for, so it will begin winding down service starting today. A roadmap on the game’s website lists a three-step sunsetting schedule. Today, you can no longer purchase Shinra credits from the shop, but you can still spend the credits you own until the game shuts down. On November 1, support for non-English localization ends (meaning text will only be displayed in English going forward). Finally, on January 11, The First Soldier goes offline for good.\nHere's the full End of Service announcement via Twitter:\nThe First Soldier was revealed in February 2021 alongside another mobile FFVII RPG, Ever Crisis (which has yet to release but has a closed beta planned for this year). The third-person battle royale took place before the events of FFVII and pit 75 players against each other as SOLDIER candidates. In addition to using firearms, players wield magic and even summons. Square previously stated The First Soldier was an attempt to attract a wider fanbase to the FFVII universe while giving existing fans a new way to enjoy its mythos. \nUnfortunately, this isn't the first Square Enix published multiplayer game to get the axe this year. Babylon's Fall, Platinum Games' live-service action RPG, is also being shutdown in February, less than a year after its ill-received launch. \nWhile The First Soldier is going away, plenty of FFVII content is in the pipeline. As previously mentioned, Ever Crisis remains on the docket, and Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion releases on December 13. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, the follow-up to Remake, is scheduled to launch next winter.",

Check out the gym leader Iono trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, there's a lot going on in this new video. Iono is very much a Paldean influencer, which is a fun addition to the universe of Pokémon, but she's also a gym leader that we'll be facing off against in the game. As for her type, it's Electric, and while not confirmed, it seems the video is hinting toward a gym challenge for her. Before actually battling her, we might have to successfully complete her \"who's that Pokémon?\" test.\nIn this instance, she describes her very own Pokémon pal, but we don't get the answer. Perhaps we're meant to know what it is based on her description or maybe she's describing a Pokémon we haven't yet met. Only time will tell. Fortunately, we don't have to wait too much longer to meet this \"Supercharged Streamer\" because Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet hit Switch on November 18. \nIn the meantime, check out this 14-minute Pokémon Scarlet and Violet gameplay trailer from last week, and then watch this video all about Wiglett, a new Diglett-like Pokémon.

          "description": "Witchfire has been one of the most promising-looking shooters since its reveal in 2017. The dark fantasy romp was slated to launch in early access later this year, but a shift in design has forced developer The Astronauts to push that launch into next year.\nThe Astronauts has decided to rework Witchfire’s arena-style combat into an open-world format. Creative director Adrian Chmielarz writes in a blog post that the change makes Witchfire a “better” game. \n“The feature is now 95% implemented. It makes the game better. It is kind of hard for me to imagine the player did not have that freedom before. Sure, you can still be trapped by the witch in this or that spot, and some doors will be closed until you find a key, and it might be too dangerous to enter areas closer to the boss before you are ready– but the world is wide open for you to explore in almost any order, and you can both push forward and retreat as you please.”\nChmielarz also teases more Witchfire news to emerge in the next week or so. It won’t be gameplay footage but rather content promoting the game’s art and world in some fashion. \nWitchfire blends gunplay with the supernatural as players wield guns and magic to fend off otherworldly threats. The game is set in an alternate reality where you’re tasked with hunting down a witch at the behest of the church. The Astronauts previously developed The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, and the studio is made up of ex-People Can Fly employees. \nWitchfire is still slated to launch on PC via The Epic Game Store in early 2023.

One of those franchises was Mortal Kombat, a bloody, gory fighting game that took concepts from other fighting games and dialed them to 11. The series became notorious for its spine-ripping, heart-grabbing, limb-chopping action, but beneath the controversies and the hearings was a technically sound, capable fighting game. \nThe Mortal Kombat franchise has continued to grow and evolve, showcasing massive staying power in a sometimes ruthless industry.

This punk rock-inspired warrior hails from another universe and is an Umbra Witch in training. She doesn’t have the same handle on her abilities as Bayonetta (nor her confident elegance), so Viola sports a vastly different playstyle that reflects her inexperience. \n\n\nInstead of being adept at using a variety of weapons like Bayonetta, Viola only uses her katana and throwing darts. She also summons her demonic companion Cheshire for backup. What she lacks in finesse, though, she makes up for with raw power.\nPlaying as Viola, her style feels noticeably more deliberate. She’s still quick, but her sword attacks feel more measured and, most of all, impactful. This approach tells me t…",

The game introduces several big additions, quite literally in some cases, to the game’s already winning formula, and you can check them out in this exclusive gameplay video. \nBefore we jump on what’s new, the core of Bayonetta 3’s combat remains the same, so veterans will find it easy to slip back into the fun dance of chaining combos, peppering foes with gunfire, unleashing torture attacks, and split-second dodging to trigger the time-slowing Witch Time effect. However, one of Bayonetta’s new tricks is Demon Masquerade. Weapons are now imbued with the power of Bayonetta’s many Infernal Demons.

The publisher also appears to be teasing the reveal of a new Crash game \nThe publisher sent a special Crash-themed pizza box (from \"Aku Aku's Steam-In Pizza Shack\") to influencers, such as YouTuber Candian Guy Eh. His unboxing video shows that the box is taped with a not-so-subtle message that Crash 4 heads to Steam on October 18. The game, which launched in 2020, is currently playable on PC only through Battle.net. \nAdditionally, the box was also taped with a message that read, “Hungry for more? Try our new Wumpa Pizza for $12.08!” Given that The Game Awards is set to air on December 8, it appears highly likely we’ll find out the nature of this title (rumored to be a party game called Wumpa League) during the annual show.\nAre you excited to play Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time on Steam?

It also features our first listen to Chris Pratt's Mario.\nPratt teased back in June that his Mario voice is \"unlike anything you've heard in the Mario world,\" and it turns out he's right in that we've never heard Pratt's voice in the world of Mario, which is to say his Mario just sounds like him. Elsewhere in the trailer, which aired during a special Nintendo Direct all about the film today, we get a glimpse at the movie's villain, Bowser, who is voiced by Jack Black, Toad, voiced by Keegan-Michael Key, and even a quick shot at Luigi at the end. \nCheck out the Super Mario Bros. movie trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Super Mario Bros. looks like you'd expect, in line with Illumination's other animated movies like Despicable Me and Minions.

It features the slick realistic visuals fans of the series know quite well but this time, it's mixed with an almost anime-like animation style. It looks great, in my opinion, but it likely won't be for everybody. \nCheck out the Need For Speed Unbound reveal trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Unbound represents a pretty drastic departure for the series in terms of visuals but elsewhere, it looks like Need For Speed. There seems to be plenty of car customization, cops to run from, city streets to speed through, and if the reveal trailer's song by A$AP Rocky is any indication, a great soundtrack.\nOnly time will tell but fortunately, we don't have to wait too long because Need For Speed Unbound hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on December 2. As you might have noticed, the reveal trailer doesn't mention consoles from the previous generation, like the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, so you might need a current-gen machine to play the game. \nAre you excited for Need For Speed Unbound?

Some players are excited about the numbered sequel while others wonder why this wasn't just a big update for the original Overwatch, which is no longer accessible.

          "description": "Last week, Google announced it plans to shut down Stadia on January 18. One of the less-discussed casualties of the news was that Tequila Works’ Gylt, a horror adventure game and the first Stadia-exclusive title, would disappear entirely. Thankfully, that won’t be the case.\nTequila Works has confirmed that it plans to make Gylt multiplatform in 2023. It doesn’t specify which platforms the game will become available on, but it’s a relief to know that one of Stadia’s few original gems won’t be lost to history. \n🎃 We bring terrific news: GYLT is going multiplatform in 2023! More info to come in the upcoming months.https://t.co/ON1pbiGsB9 pic.twitter.com/2sWdseym2G\nOctober 4, 2022\nGylt launched in November 2019 alongside Stadia. It stars a young girl named Sally who searches for her missing cousin across a town haunted by evil spirits. The narrative also serves a commentary on bullying and depresssion. The game’s vibe and art direction evoke films like Coraline or Tim Burton’s animated works and channels games like Inside and Silent Hill. Gameplay emphasizes stealth, with players using a flashlight to defeat enemies. Despite its more innocent veneer, the game has its share of genuinely creepy moments, and I personally found it to be an enjoyable horror romp.\nWill you be checking out Gylt before Stadia shuts down or wait to play it elsewhere next year?

          "description": "Sony announced its new gaming loyalty program, PlayStation Stars, back in July, and the service is now live in North and South America. PlayStation users can sign up for the free program, but there’s one big caveat.\nPlayStation Stars allows players to earn points and digital collectibles by completing “campaigns,” which range from completing small objectives while playing games to larger monthly challenges. Any PlayStation player can join Stars; you don’t need a Plus subscription. \nCompleting campaigns also raises your Star Status, a leveling system consisting of four ranks. Everyone begins at Level 1, but doing things like purchasing games from PSN or earning a certain number of trophy rarities raises this level, increasing the quality of rewards you earn. \nDigital rewards, which Sony confirmed are not NFTs and cannot be resold, include models of old PlayStation consoles and characters from first-party titles. You can also redeem points to use as funds for your digital store wallet and to purchase DLC. Points remain available for 24 months after earning them. \nIf you’re running to sign up now, there’s already a waitlist to join PS Stars. Sony states that new users will have to wait about two months after the date they register to be accepted into the program. It's unclear why this is the case, but one could assume Sony doesn't want to be flooded with too many memberships at once as it gradually gets the program off the ground. Registration also doesn't seem consistent yet, as some folks were immediately let in while others have been told to wait (and some others still can't access Stars in parts of the U.S. as of publishing). \nPlayStation Stars will launch in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand next week on October 13. To learn more about the program, including its handy FAQ, you can visit its official site here.",
