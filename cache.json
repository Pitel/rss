Canadian solo developer Cheesemaster brings us this Japanese- and Korean-inspired afterlife sim. It’s a brew of Spirited Away, Stardew Valley, and other things that mostly goes down well, albeit with a few harder-to-swallow bits.\nYou create a character with limited customisation, and you’re told you’re a writer moving to a small town to focus on your book. As you settle in, you realise there are some odd occurrences that the locals can’t understand or explain. You’re given tea leaves which, when brewed in the teapot left by the previous resident, grant you ‘spirit vision’, the ability to see spirits invisible to the naked eye. Guided by Wonyan – a cat-like spirit guide who’s, well, catty – you’ll uncover some ghostly goings-on, and find the lost spirits causing them.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "It's-an-RPG!\nOn paper, Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars is a game that probably shouldn’t exist. It brought together Nintendo’s platforming icon with RPG giant Square in a way that seemed impossible, imbuing the denizens of the Mushroom Kingdom (and beyond) with bucketloads of personality beyond the hops, jumps, and yelps they were previously known for. It’s got humour in spades, from tongue-in-cheek jokes to characters pantomiming events whenever they retell them. It’s weird and hilarious, and it knows it — and that’s why people love it.\nSo it’s a darn good thing that Super Mario RPG, the Switch remake of 1996's turn-based favourite, retains the weirdness that gave the SNES original a special charm. Not a hair is out of place in this remake. We said in our preview that this is one of the most faithful HD adaptations we’ve ever played, and now that we’ve seen everything the game has to offer, we stand by that statement, and it’s all the better for it. This is a magical experience reworked to near perfection with high-definition clarity.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

At the start of each week, your minions might choose to go on strike, demanding everything from more cells in the prison to fewer dwarves in the workplace. If that second example elicited a startled little “yikes”, then good, you’re paying attention. Your minions are also occasional racists – which at least makes some of the more brutal options at hand for dealing with striking workers more palatable.\r\n\n\r\nYou can sacrifice the entire picket line to your in-house demon lord, or terminate their employment without tribunal. You can also lock them up in those prisons they repeatedly claim are so lacking in cells. Or you can agree to their terms to expand the canteen and sack all of their shortest colleagues. But no matter which option you choose, minion strikes are inconsequential, only ever amounting to a comedy aside. Just as the turn-based Dungeon Of Naheulbeuk set out to skewer D&D, Naheulbeuk’s Dungeon Master is a brave and self-aware parody of dungeon management games.

          "description": "Have you ever watched critically acclaimed 1998 comedy drama The Truman Show and thought \"What if the whole city was people who didn't know they were in a TV show?\". That's kind of the deal with American Arcadia, a puzzle-platformer about a dude who lives in an ultra advanced dome city that is for some reason 70s-themed, and is also a huge reality show for the Twitch generation. \nI actually love the 70s theme. This combined with story-within-a-story-within-a-story framing, bits of lovely, almost Wes Anderson-esque art design, and some extreme multi-tasking combining 2.5D and 3D makes American Arcadia an interesting little treat. Do the twists upon twists get a bit over cooked? Maybe. But you can live with it.\nRead more",

It’s powered by what the developers are calling “living ink”, an art style that fills in each papery map as you play. \r\n\n\r\nThe game certainly looks arresting: your cursor is a quill, the HUD is a collection of smaller parchment scraps, and the terrain is a slowly brightening wash of swirling colours, leaking beyond the outlines of trees and buildings. Lovely stuff. And what's more, you get to beat up a bunch of wolves.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Since the credits rolled on Persona 5 (and also before, and sometimes concurrently), the Phantom Thieves have spent their time in a rubbish Dynasty Warriors knock-off, got lost in a dream about a really cheap rhythm-action game and ended up trapped in a cross-generational dungeon crawler. Now they find themselves embroiled in - of all things - an X-COM style turn-based strategy game. \r\n\n\r\nYour energy for Persona 5 Tactica is going to come down to how much tolerance you have for the Persona 5 brand’s Baz Luhrmann-style maximalism. If you're emotionally invested in the gang, it'll definitely help. But even if you're a Persona veteran or a total newcomer, you'll find the story a bit loose, the chats a bit tiring, and the combat a bit simplistic.

          "description": "Making a strategy game is \"harder than people give it credit for,\" Bit Reactor's CEO Greg Foertsch tells me. The same could probably be said of any game this year in particular, but having spent over 20 years shepherding the art teams at Firaxis on Civilization, XCOM, Sid Meier's Pirates, Alpha Centauri and most recently Marvel's Midnight Suns, Foertsch has seen firsthand what it takes for strategy games to break new ground over the years, and what an arduous road it's been for the genre to get where it is today. Not only was it \"late to party on 3D, they were late to the party on consoles,\" but it's also \"suffered from lower budgets, which means it just hasn't pushed in the way that other genres have,\" he says. \nEven now, \"it's got some catching up to do,\" he continues, but there are plenty of reasons to be positive, too. As we speak at the beginning of September, our conversation quickly turns to Baldur's Gate 3, whose enormous success Foertsch cites as a clear and obvious sign that \"there's a thirst for something different now,\" both within RPG circles and, perhaps a little unexpectedly, for strategy heads as well. It's his hope that his own upcoming project, the closely guarded Star Wars strategy game his new studio Bit Reactor are working on in collaboration with Respawn, will follow in these lauded footsteps. \"We want to make a game and just have people say, 'Man, that's amazing game, and oh, it happens to be strategy.'

It doesn’t have Jusant’s quietly innovative grip and abseiling mechanics – the climbing is closer to Shadow Of The Colossus, consisting of just one button you hold to cling on till your stamina runs out. Nor does it have the Don’t Nod game's beautifully nested chunks of backstory - no seashells you can press your ear to, alas. But it does have massive flying cephalopods, giant red mushrooms, and floating, fractured landscapes of rock and grass. \r\n\nThe gameworld drifts whimsically between categories, neither macroscopic nor microscopic, at times a kind of ocean reef, and at other times, a mysterious, alternate dimension we might summarise as “Cthulhu’s Zen Chillout Room”. The climbing aside, you can glide short distances by inflating what looks like a blowfish, and there are (regular-sized) capybara to chase down and collect. When you die, the game plays a didgeridoo at you in a faintly jocular way. The whole thing pongs of quantum physics.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Shadows of Doubt is the voxel-based 1980s detective sim in which the glass is always rain-slicked, the coffee as bitter as the human soul, and the whodunnits, procedurally generated. Hard-nosed private eye Rachel (RPS in peace) pronounced herself fascinated but a little stumped by it, back in April, while Graham described it as his \"ideal game\" in a post about the recent addition of infidelity cases and lost-and-found jobs, adding to my suspicions that Graham is some kind of jigsaw killer and that his news posts are actually ciphered confessions of his terrible crimes.\nWell, these already viscous plots are about to thicken into a borderline-immobile soup of intrigue, for ColePowered Games are adding modding tools to the game. These will allow you to pen your own detective mysteries, and even alter the surrounding city to fit.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's still a co-op multiplayer affair, however.\r\n\n\r\nThe reboot follows an evaluation period during which Remedy and publisher Tencent discussed a proof-of-concept version of the game, as we reported last month. They've now kicked it back to the concept phase \"due to uncertainties in creating a successful game [in] the rapidly changing free-to-play market and associated risks\". A few members of the old Vanguard development team have moved to other Remedy projects, while the core leadership and certain select developers carry on with Kestrel.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Spirittea from Edmonton, Canada-based Cheesemaker Games is Spirited Away in the guise of a Stardew Valley-style management sim. Released today, it casts you as a wholesome young entrepreneur who has just arrived in a town full of rogue supernatural creatures. To free the town from its spectral infestation, you must renovate an old mountain bathhouse and treat each phantom to a jolly good scrub. You might also need to deal with some Unfinished Business, such as tracking down a lost possession. At least there's no witch to worry about. That I know of, anyway.\r\n\n\r\nI have fond memories of Spirited Away - it was the film that re-introduced me to anime as an undergraduate, following the traditional early-career middlebrow otaku phase of obsessing over Akira, Cowboy Bebop and Ghost in the Shell while turning my nose up at stuff like Naruto, because it's \"just for kids\". I was on the brink of pitching a Spirittea review, but then our reviews editor Ed Thorn emerged howling and gibbering from the floorboards and asked me to review a 100-hour RPG instead (won't spoil), so I'll have to settle for trying the demo.\r\n \nRead more",

Many of his ideas for 2022's finest historical fantasy RPG have their twitching, eldritch roots in pen-and-paper sessions with friends. Take questions of money and wealth. Speaking to me over Zoom one rainy October afternoon, Aureus recalls one particular table-top campaign he ran in which, after 10 or so sessions, the player party had sunk into abject poverty. \"They reached a collapsed village, [and] they said, 'is there a cart around here?' So I rolled the dice and decided that all right, there is a wagon, that's completely functional with all its wheels and so on. So they just started to walk around and shove on the top of their wagon, whatever of value they could find. \r\n\n\r\n\"They had no shame!\" Aureus goes on. \"Just gathering all the scraps of iron, all the tools, knives, musical instruments, pieces of fabric - anything they could find, they were just taking it all with them on the assumption that whenever they reached a civilised spot, they're just going to sell it all.\"  This was foolhardy behaviour, because all the objects in question were trash with little resale value. \"So they at the same time they had more than they could ever need, and they had pretty much nothing. They mainly had a hindrance that was slowing them down - this wagon full of stuff was just difficult to move through the paths.\" \r\n\n \nRead more",

In news worth holding the press for, he thinks they're pretty cheap for what you get in return.\nZelnick cautioned one investor against \"generalising\" about the state of game pricing based on the recent fortunes of TV and movie subscription services like Netflix, which have had to increase subscription fees to match their expenses after underpricing themselves initially to grow their audiences. Videogames might be all about subscription services these days, Zelnick said, but that doesn't mean they are subject to the same commercial logics as ye olde non-interactive media. In particular, it doesn't mean publishers are currently able to raise videogame prices, even if they feel like they're overdelivering.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Still, sometimes these glimpses and ideas are interesting enough that I quite enjoy trying to figure them out.

Apparently it's such a great game that the only way to achieve a similar high after being banned is hijacking a schoolbus and forcing teenagers to kill each other.\nHere's a fun (nonlethal) game we can play together, reader dear: I'm going to describe Gods Of Combat as best I can, then you tell me how you think it works.\nRead more",

For me, the PlayStation One was mostly a machine to play Final Fantasies VII through IX on, and not much else (it was a very belated and cheap second-hand purchase, I should note, and games were still sufficiently expensive back then that maintaining two healthy game libraries for both the family N64 and my new Squall box was nigh on impossible). Nevertheless, I've been increasingly fascinated by the revival of PS1-era games in recent years, and it's been interesting to see which modern games have been \"demade\" in this style - see Bloodborne PSX - and which ones have made it their own from the off - see Signalis, Heartworm, and many others. \nCrow Country is the latest game I've seen to take up the PSX mantle, and it combines the chunkiness of Final Fantasy VII-style character models with the grimy survival horror of something like Resident Evil to brilliant effect. Made by SFB Games, the same devs wot made the also excellent Tangle Tower, it's currently got a very good demo up on Steam at the moment, and it's got me thinking: what do you like most about PS1-era games on PC, and which ones are your all-time favs?\nRead more",

The Heroic edition gives you all that plus a mount, a pet and extra in-game cash. And then there's the most expensive Epic edition, which includes a pet, two toys, 30 days of game time... and three days of early beta access to the game, yours for $89.99 in the states. \r\n\n\r\nNaturally, World of Warcrafters are rather concerned about the last bit. It's the first time Blizzard's long-running MMO has taken the paid early access approach, recently adopted by Starfield and Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 - there have been early access betas in the past, but they've been doled out by lottery. Blizzard's game director Ion Hazzikostas has now moved to reassure the grousers and gripers, promising that The War Within's Epic edition won't give minted early worms the edge over those poor peasants who scoop up the less pricey versions.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Its reveal was a surprise, mind – haven’t Valve repeatedly said that there wouldn’t be another new Steam Deck for ages?\r\n\n\r\nNot quite. That warning was always qualified in that a more powerful Deck was still a ways off, and the Steam Deck OLED’s performance improvements are both tiny and a likely incidental result of its efficiency savings. This very point was repeated to me in an interview with Valve designer Jay Shaw and software engineer Jeremy Selan, which also covered the Steam Deck family’s future, its current struggles with intensive big-budget games, and why they want \"more, more, more\" rivals like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go.\r\n\n \nRead more",

As great a handheld gaming PC as the original Steam Deck is, its slightly bland IPS display and short battery life are some definite weak points – points to which newer, shinier rivals, such as the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go, have been happy to apply pressure.\nValve are keen to stress that this OLED-equipped model represents an update, not a whole generational switcheroo. Yet there’s much, much more behind that screen that just some different diodes. This is a lighter, brighter, longer-lasting, sometimes even faster-running take on the SteamOS handheld, and one that sneaks in some surprise upgrades as often as it addresses issues with the original Steam Deck.

As he makes clear to his army of Russian ultranationalists, he is interested only in their quiet, unwavering loyalty. Evidently, Activision expects much the same from its army of COD fans. This latest Modern Warfare campaign follows disconcertedly close on the heels of 2022’s entry because, as per Bloomberg, it began life as a mere expansion. Rather than allow a fallow year, Activision has upgraded that expansion’s status to a premium release, and charged $69.99 for pre-orders - granting early access to the single-player campaign as an enticement.\r\n\n\r\nInstead of Modern Warfare’s usual lead studio, Infinity Ward, development duties have fallen to Sledgehammer, the outfit most recently responsible for 2021’s unloved Vanguard. And in an industry where AAA FPS games now regularly take half a decade to make, this campaign has reportedly come together in less than two years. Reader: it shows.\r\n\n \nRead more",

A faked death finally saw him freed from the shackles of the yakuza with one big catch: he couldn't ever see his family again. Since then, we've had the plucky Ichiban take on the mantle of Tojo Clan nastiness in Yakuza: Like A Dragon (7), with its sequel Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth (8) set to wash up on Hawaii's shores next year. What do we know about Infinite Wealth? Kiryu is set to return as a protagonist alongside Ichiban, with an all-new haircut. And more importantly, what has Like A Dragon Gaiden got to do with any of this? Well, it's a shorter stop-gap between the events of Yakuza 6 and Yakuza 8 that fills us in on what Kiryu's been up to this whole time.\nBut aside from moreish minigames and a fantastic Agent persona with web-slinging abilities, Kiryu's epilogue is a far cry from Yakuza's best stories. By no means is it bad, it just isn't the best introduction to the series for newcomers, and even longtime fans will struggle balancing his resurrection with its heavy feelings of repetition.\nRead more",

I want someone who really, really loves and hates things, and gives you reasons why.”\nIt’s a trait which Giovannetti has in common with his Megacrit co-founder, Casey Yano, and has possessed ever since he was a kid growing up in Woodinville, 30 minutes outside Seattle. It’s matched by a competitiveness that first emerged in Warhammer 40,000 tournaments as a teen.

Echoing his relatively guarded enthusiasm for NFTs a couple of years ago, he’s sort of mixed on them, regarding AI tools less as transformative technologies than simply the latest step towards the eternal industry objective of More, Faster And Better For Less.\nZelnick thinks automated learning and generation tools will make development more “efficient” and games, overall “better”, but in terms of Take-Two’s own bottom line, any gains will likely be offset by the fact that other big companies have access to the same tools, and by the fact that Take-Two will take advantage of said efficiencies by setting more ambitious goals. As such, he doesn’t think using generative AI will lead to lower prices for big commercial games. If you’re a developer that can’t afford to buy or license generative “AI” tools, Zelnick added, you can expect competition to become “more intense” in the coming years. Good stuff. \nRead more",

          "description": "As regular readers of this column will know, I'm a big fan of OLED TVs and monitors. One of my favourites is Dell's Alienware AW3423DWF, a 34-inch ultrawide that offers a fairly standard 3440x1440 165Hz spec - but its QD-OLED panel makes for a night-and-day difference against your standard VA and IPS panel alternatives, with perfect contrast, near-instant pixel response times, gorgeous colour reproduction and stunning HDR. \nIt normally retails for around £929, but today it's down to £739 when you use the code GROUPON8 at Dell UK. That's about as cheap as we've ever seen it, and well worth it for anyone that wants a monitor primarily for gaming rather than content creation or mixed purposes. \nRead more",

Having built yourself a no-name crim, you galloped around cranking out cash and XP by means of glorified sidequests handed down by headliners such as Lamar. Skip forward to 2023, and as Alice0 observed when we discussed Rockstar's GTA 6 announcements this morning, GTA Online is effectively an MMO with ten years of updates, expansions and community projects under its belt.

          "description": "Hallowe’en may be over (just), but for this month’s Reality Frights, I’ve got a wonderfully seasonal game for you. It’s the brand-new remake of the grand old mystery puzzler The 7th Guest, a game which Bill Gates notably referred to as “The new standard of interactive entertainment.” In fairness to ol’ William, he said this seven months before Doom blew out the new standard’s insides with a 12-gauge shotgun, shunting PC gamers’ tastes away from kitsch adventure games and toward grisly murder-fests. But The 7th Guest is nonetheless fondly remembered for its spooky atmosphere, alongside its blend of pre-rendered backgrounds and live action cutscenes you could call ‘pioneering’ had it not proved such an evolutionary dead end.\nToday, the original 7th Guest looks more dated than Henry VIII, which is probably why this remake replaces everything but the very skeleton of the 1993 original. The game still takes place in a creepy mansion belonging to a murderous toymaker, and still involves six eccentric guests to the house searching for a missing boy named Tad. But it’s otherwise been completely rebuilt, with whole new puzzles and whole new mechanics, all designed to be experienced in first-person VR.\nRead more",

The physical release has been confirmed to be playable on-disc as a Deluxe Edition, which comes with a full, 3-disc soundtrack, a poster, and more.\n\n\nThe PlayStation 5 edition will contain 2 discs, while the Xbox Series X edition will contain 3 discs. PC, meanwhile, has a CD key and installer.\n\n\n\n\nIncluded in the Deluxe Edition for Baldur’s Gate 3 is the aforementioned poster of a mind flayer, a set of 32 stickers featuring iconography from the game’s story, the original soundtrack from the game, a world map, two patches — one of the Absolute logo and one of the Flaming Fist logo — and the game itself, on your chosen platform. You'll also get all Digital Deluxe edition content, too.\n\n\nIf you’ve been tracking the release status of Baldur’s Gate 3 since its digital PC launch in August and its digital PS5 release a month later, you might be surprised to read it’s only just now making the leap to a physical edition. \n\n\nUntil this announcement, the only way to get your hands on a physical copy of Baldur’s Gate 3 was in Japan. Spike Chunsoft, the developer of the Danganronpa series, was announced to be publishing the physical edition in Japan on December 21. But now, fans the world over can add the physical edition of this remarkable game to their libraries.\n\n\nPre-orders for the physical edition of Baldur’s Gate 3 are now open for all platforms.

There wasn't any.\n\n\nToday, we'll be discussing Valve's influential 1998 first-person shooter Half-Life.

Why yes, I have lost a bit of weight. Thank you for noticing.\n\n\nNow, I've never been an academic, but it was something of a dream of mine.

          "description": "As initially reported by IGN, Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors commented during a financial presentation that he has no comment on the state of the Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake. He also states, “Anything I say to this becomes a headline.” Yes, sir. Yes, sir, it will.\n\n\nA remake of the classic 2003 RPG Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic was announced back in 2021 during a Playstation Showcase. Since then, we’ve received re-releases of the two games in the series, and then everything kind of hit the rocks. The re-releases didn’t go very smoothly, and the intention of adding restored cut content to the second game (which badly needs it) was canceled. \n\n\nIn 2022, Bloomberg reported that the remake might have been put on hold. This was following the production of a demo – which reportedly didn’t go over very well – and the subsequent firing of the art and design director.\n\n\nWhile Wingefors statement doesn’t really say anything, the fact that it says nothing is pretty telling. If production was chugging along on schedule, he probably would have been quick to tout its promising outlook. It also doesn’t clarify if the project is on indefinite hold or canceled outright. So, that leaves us to speculate.\n\n\nI was pretty skeptical of the project, to begin with. Aspyr and Saber Interactive are capable studios, but they’re mostly known for porting existing games. A remake on this scale is pretty massive, so even if it saw the light of day, I’m not certain it would meet its ambition. Now, however, Embracer has been laying off massive amounts of people – reportedly 900 in a single financial quarter. I’m not saying it’s impossible for the Knights of the Old Republic remake to eventually see the light of day, but I’ll believe it when I see it.\n\nThe post Embracer boss gives no-comment comment on status of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake appeared first on Destructoid.",

PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch versions will be released at a later date.\n\n\nThe Kindeman Remedy is a warped game about a disgraced doctor and morally bankrupt nun performing experiments on prisoners in an attempt to create a breakthrough treatment. It’s a pretty violent take on the medical management genre, as you torture and poison the inmates as you seek to restore the doctor’s reputation at any cost. You’re able to upgrade your facilities and manage resources as you perform your macabre work.\n\n\n\n\nThe whole horror-management mash-up genre has been growing lately, following the success of Graveyard Keeper and Ravenous Devils. Perhaps there’s some crossover between people who enjoy management games and misanthropes. A category that I fit neatly into.\n\n\nI dig it. I would have liked to review this one if the season wasn’t so packed. Really, I’m waiting for someone to make something based on real-world serial killer H.H. Holmes and his Murder Castle. Only, hopefully, based less on reality because that whole tale is really screwed up. I just like the idea of the location also being the murder weapon.\n\n\nThe Kindeman Remedy is available today on PC via Steam.

However, there's a chance that Team Green may be halting production of two of its products.\n\n\nThat's according to a post on Board Channels (as spotted by Videocardz), which states that Nvidia has allegedly \"discontinued\" the RTX 4070 Ti and RTX 4080. The information goes on to say that the \"last distribution of goods in the 2023Q4 quarter has ended.\"\n\n\nImage via Videocardz (source: Board Channels)\n\n\nWhile the rumor has not been confirmed, one reason behind this could be so Nvidia can concentrate on newer models in the 4000 range. This could be in relation to the alleged RTX 4080 SUPER as well as a potential 4070 Ti SUPER.\n\n\nSomething could be lost in translation\n\n\nAs the report from Videocardz notes, there's no real way to verify whether this information is 100% accurate or not. There may be some miscommunication going on here. It's possible that what's being said is referring to a temporary hold on mass production of the RTX cards, as opposed to fully discontinuing the SKUs.\n\n\nAs always with these things, it's best to temper any immediate judgements you may have. Nvidia will hopefully come forward with official word on what's true and what isn't.\n\n\nThis current generation of graphics cards is only a year old (or just over) so it probably wouldn't make sense for a tech firm to completely discontinue products. More stock may be put into some SUPER variants, but it doesn't seem likely that Nvidia would cease production of two of its graphics cards at this point.\n\nThe post Nvidia reportedly stops mass production of two RTX 4000 cards appeared first on Destructoid.",

Announcements of layoffs from some of the biggest names around have been dominating news sections lately. While we already knew Embracer Group was one of them, we now know the figures.\n\n\nIn the most recent sales report from the Crystal Dynamics and Gearbox Software owner, the company has said it experienced a 13% increase in net sales between July and September of this year (Q2 of their 2023-2024 fiscal year).\n\n\n\n\nIt then goes on to acknowledge that \"around 900\" people were part of the \"reduction in headcount.\" This equates to 5% of the whole workforce. That's quite an astonishing amount of people to let go. Embracer Group said it's also \"reduced the number of projects\" being worked on and is focussing on \"improving the projected return on investment within PC/Console.\"\n\n\nAt least the company is doing well...\n\n\nThe report goes on to say that CEO Lars Wingeford would like to \"put on record a special thanks to the people who have left Embracer in the quarter.\" Unfortunately, it's unlikely to bring much comfort to those who have lost their jobs.\n\n\nWe already knew that developers under Embracer's umbrella were being targeted for mass layoffs. However, this latest report really hammers home the extent to which studios have been affected by these \"reductions.\"\n\n\nYou've heard this story dozens of times already. Ubisoft, Team17, Naughty Dog, Amazon, CD Projekt Red, and many more have all been involved in redundancies, many to the tune of hundreds. One wonders whether anyone would still be interested in seeking a career in game development after all this.\n\nThe post The monolith that is Embracer Group confirms 900 layoffs in just one quarter appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Sonic has been enjoying renewed popularity in recent years thanks to the two Sonic the Hedgehog movies that have become some of the highest-grossing video game adaptations. Sega hopes to capitalize on this by bringing more of its franchises to a non-gaming audience. \n\n\nIn an interview with CNBC, Sega's chief operating officer Shuji Utsumi revealed that the platforms they are considering include movies and even Roblox. The second Sonic movie grossed an impressive $405.4 million, so it's no surprise that they hope to replicate this success with its other IPs. \n\n\nIPs that are being considered include Like a Dragon (previously known as Yakuza). An adaption could be a hit, as it already has a huge following. As Sega reveals, the franchise has sold 21.1 million units.\n\n\nPersona may also find itself on more platforms. It's easy to imagine it being adapted to a film series or even a television series, as the franchise already features gripping narratives and plenty of relationships and friendships to explore. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid.\n\n\nSega denies acquisition rumors\n\n\nThere have been rumors that Microsoft is keen to purchase Sega, but Utsumi denies this. He explains that several companies are interested in acquiring Sega, and though it is an honor, he doesn't believe that \"kind of transaction is going to happen.\"\n\n\nThis doesn't mean that Sega isn't planning to make some acquisitions for itself. Utsumi claims the company is still looking for growth during a time when Japanese studios are doing well while \"European studios are struggling\" following the post-COVID-19 sales decline. \n\n\nWe've seen some of the effects of this through the seemingly endless waves of layoffs that have struck the industry. Utsumi remains optimistic, and he believes that the future is bright so long as \"you have solid development studios and also solid IPs.\" \n\nThe post After the success of the Sonic the Hedgehog movies, Sega wants to bring more of its IPs to other platforms appeared first on Destructoid.",

It is set in Baghdad, and the region is filled to the brim with gorgeous sights and well-hidden collectibles. For players who want to experience the ancient city again but don't want to lose all their upgrades, the update will be a godsend. \n\n\nThe trend of games not launching with a New Game+ mode is an increasingly annoying and increasingly common problem. Fortunately, it wasn't enough to completely ruin Mirage, and upon launching, it received relatively good reviews from critics who appreciated the more streamlined approach it takes. \n\n\nThings are quite busy in the Assassin's Creed world, as AC: Nexus VR launches on November 16 on the Meta Quest 2 and 3.

The delay is to give the game “some additional time in development,” according to a press release sent to Destructoid.\n\n\n“As the finishing touches were put on the game over recent weeks, the team saw the opportunity to add more polish and quality, and given they have the comfort to allow themselves some extra time the decision was made to delay,” the press release said.\n\n\n\n\nIt’d seem the delay is mostly applicable to the PC version of The Thaumaturge, though it is said that the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series versions will be coming “at a later date.”\n\n\nFor those out of the loop, The Thaumaturge follows — you guessed it — a thaumaturge named Wiktor Szulski, who is sent on a quest to cope with the metaphorical skeletons in his past. \n\n\n“Unfolding in 1905 Warsaw, the story revolves around the complex theme of inner demons and how in this world that can mean more than just a mental burden,” according to the press release.\n\n\nIt’s worth noting that aside from The Thaumaturge, Fool’s Theory is also concurrently working on the upcoming remake of CD Projekt Red’s The Witcher. The remake was announced in October 2022, and is being “rebuilt from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5,” according to the announcement.

Shinji Orito is the music producer, while Na-Ga, Humuyun, Yuunon Nagayama, and Ao Kimishima are handling key animation. \n\n\nMany of the details for anemoi have yet to be divulged, including release date and platforms. We'll know more soon, though, because an announcement stream is set to go live on November 17 starting at 7:00 p.m. Japan Time. While we wait, you can check out a brief teaser below.\n\n\n\n\nThe key to your heart\n\n\nKey has been working in the visual novel space since 1999, and has released titles both with and without adult content. The studio's first two works, Kanon and Air, both originally launched as adult games, while games like Clannad aimed for a wider audience from the outset. Many of their works also made the leap to anime and manga adaptations over the years. Since the teaser video doesn't offer much outside of a lightly animated visual, we'll have to wait and see what kind of notes anemoi plans to hit. \n\nThe post Clannad studio Key reveals anemoi as next romance visual novel appeared first on Destructoid.",

Let's see who might fit the many roles this 'legendary' series has to offer.\n\n\nWith the recent success of The Super Mario Bros. Movie and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Nintendo is venturing into adapting The Legend of Zelda into live-action. First created in 1985, the series has become one of the most well-known in Nintendo's pantheon. With Wes Ball (Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, The Maze Runner series) in the director's chair, it's only a matter of time before casting begins. No story details were given, but I figured with my love of entertainment that I'd try my hand at cast predictions. Will they come true? Maybe. Is it worth a try? Absolutely. Let's begin!…",

It’s just not indie. Its developer and publisher, Mintrocket, is a direct subsidiary of Nexon. The South Korean game publisher has an annual revenue in the billions of dollars. That’s not indie.\n\n\nDredge has more claim to the category of indie. Its publisher, Team17, considers itself an \"indie publisher,\" a label not exclusive to them.

Not much more was said about this mod editor, though it was said that it’ll be free upon release.\n\n\n\n\n“It will allow you to create your own experiences in the game by making something completely new or editing existing quests and content,” the post said. In the replies, one user asked if the mod editor would be coming to consoles in addition to PC, to which it replied that it’ll only be available for PC.\n\n\n\n\nThere’s no hint given as to when in 2024 this mod editor will be available, though the series’ account said more news would be shared “next year.\"\n\n\nIn any case, fans of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt are very excited for the chance to build their own content in the game. As a preview of what we can hope to expect when the mod editor drops, fans took it upon themselves to photoshop Geralt’s horse, Roach, out of the provided image and replace it with a fish and a bug, and the same user posted an image of Geralt shaking hands with Jason, of Friday the 13th fame.\n\n\nI can’t wait until we can ride through The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt atop the most noble of steeds, Thomas the Tank Engine.

It’s currently available on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, with a Switch version coming later.\n\n\nLooking at Coral Island, I mostly just see a tropical Stardew Valley. Not that that’s entirely a bad thing. Stardew Valley itself was essentially just a Harvest Moon done better. What matters here is that there are 25 damned singles in this game to romance. Now, if you’re like me, you have one question on your mind now. That mermaid princess. Can you romance her?\n\n\nAccording to my research, not right now, but maybe later. So, you may want to hold off if your singular feature of attraction is half-fish. Still, that’s a pretty large pool of marriage candidates.\n\n\n\n\nCoral Island was released into early access last year following a successful Kickstarter campaign. In that time, it has already racked up some acclaim for its take on the farm sim genre. Beyond building your farm, you can also spelunk some caverns, help restore a coral reef, or take part in community events.\n\n\nSounds like a fun time. I was thinking of starting a new game of Stardew Valley, but I will probably give this one a try instead.\n\n\nHold on, can you romance the merguy?

It is currently nominated for multiple awards at the show, including Game of the Year. Xbox exclusive gamers seem to be very eager to learn of a more solid release date because the upcoming Xbox release has been brought up by the developer multiple times, including a few days ago when they talked about the optimization breakthroughs they made.\n\n\nI’m also uncertain why the release date announcement is being held off until so late into the release window. It doesn’t leave a whole lot of time for people to start booking off work for it. Maybe it will stealth drop during the show, or perhaps it will drop on December 24, giving you more reason to ignore your family during the holidays.\n\n\nI picked up Baldur’s Gate 3 on PC during Early Access, so this announcement isn’t for me.

The title was initially part of the Taito Milestones 2 collection, but on November 16, it will be available separately.\n\n\nAs someone who appreciates kusoge, I loved the Taito Milestones 2 collection because it contained a bunch of terrible games amongst its gems. DinoRex was the one that captivated me the most because it is just so, so bad. It sort of feels like a bad attempt at Primal Rage. You control a cave guy who orders a dinosaur to fight other dinosaurs. Big, chubby dinosaurs who look like they were ripped from 1933’s King Kong. Little harmless-looking toy dinosaurs.\n\n\nIt controls like absolute butt, which kind of adds to the charm. But on top of that, if your dinosaurs get really into it, there’s a bunch of fun level destruction. Then, there are bonus dream vignettes where your dinosaur lives out their fantasy of stomping around in modern cities. It is absolutely incredible.\n\n\nI’m not saying it’s good, but if you also appreciate playing crappy games, DinoRex is top-tier. I cannot express how amazingly awful this game is, and I really think you should check it out for yourself.\n\n\nDinoRex will be joining the Arcade Archives series on Switch and PS4 on November 16\n\nThe post Majestic kusoge fighter DinoRex comes to Arcade Archives appeared first on Destructoid.",

Even Game Boy Light.\n\n\nWhen the Game Boy was first released in 1989, it came in one color, and that was grey. In 1995, they released the “Play It Loud” line-up of colors. They came in red, green, blue, yellow, black and clear. When the Game Boy Pocket came out in 1996, it came in similar colors, plus a few more, such as pink. This run of Analogue Pockets comes in all these colors, plus the Indigo and Spice of the Game Boy Advance, but minus the colors that they’ve already covered, such as clear and black.\n\n\nThis year has seen the boutique handheld get released in a number of limited edition colors, and usually, they sell out almost immediately. The handheld uses FPGA hardware emulation to recreate classic handheld consoles with as much accuracy as possible while adding modern comforts. While it works with Game Boy games out of the box, there are adapters for other consoles, such as the Atari Lynx and even the Turbografx.\n\n\nPre-orders open up on November 17th, and the consoles will ship on November 20th.

Bohemia Interactive's dystopian food scavenger simulator is still going strong, but recently it hit its biggest player count on Steam.\n\n\nAs spotted by PC Gamer, data from SteamDB shows that the game recently hit an all-time peak of 69,449 players. That's an impressive number for a relatively small game that's been around since 2012.\n\n\n\n\nBeginning life as a mod for Arma 3, DayZ was launched as a standalone title in 2018, envisioning a cruel world. A world in which the dead that roam the land are the least of your worries when you can't find food and are being shot at by trigger-happy players.\n\n\nSo why the increase in popularity now?\n\n\nA lot of games experience peaks and troughs in terms of concurrent player counts. However, for something that's over a decade old to reach a new peak is an interesting one.\n\n\nAs the PC Gamer article notes, DayZ's most recent update could be a large factor as to why more people have started playing. Version 1.23 launched just over a week ago, bringing with it some new items, such as headgear and padded gloves, and a new skybox.\n\n\nThat might not sound like reason enough for nearly 70,000 people to want to jump into the game. However, what you might not be considering is that this is a title all about embracing the tiny things; the dirty trousers with the extra pocket space, a rotten pear that could save you from starvation, and, in this case, a different sky to look at.\n\n\nIn any case, it's inspired me to reinstall DayZ, because nothing relaxes me more than outrunning zombies as I frantically seek out a zucchini.\n\nThe post DayZ inexplicably achieves its highest player count, over ten years after releasing appeared first on Destructoid.",

In fact, we can already see a bit of evidence of this, as the device is now the top-selling release on Steam at the moment.\n\n\nWhile the Steam Deck has already been pretty high up on the list, the fact that it's now at the number one spot so soon after the OLED model unveiling is probably not a coincidence.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid.\n\n\nPretty much since it launched last February (it's fast approaching its second birthday already), it's been in the sights of many-a-PC gamer. But with the latest iteration of the Deck coming this week, it's likely to keep dominating the chart at least until the new year.\n\n\nSome other interesting things to note\n\n\nThe Steam chart is a good indication of what people are playing on PC currently. The Deck's recent position at the number one spot means it's pushed Modern Warfare 3 down a notch. But let's face it, the new Call of Duty game is probably going to keep slipping based on all the reviews.\n\n\nSidetracking slightly, there's also been increased interest in Zeekerss's co-op horror game Lethal Company, which – at the time of writing – is at number four, up from 20. Interestingly-er more-so, Train Sim World 4 has experienced a massive jump, shooting up from 72 to sit comfortably at position eight.\n\n\nRight, back to the Steam Deck. I've yet to purchase one myself, but hear nothing but good things about it. However, now that the OLED model is almost here, the current devices are now starting to drop in price. And a refurbished one is 20% cheaper still. Am I tight with money or just poor? You decide.\n\nThe post Steam Deck rises to top of Steam chart days after OLED announced appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "I'm becoming increasingly aware that a lot of my articles are about retro or classic games. Well, I am monstrously old, after all. And on that note, if you want a more modern version of the beloved 90s RTS game Dungeon Keeper, look no further.\n\n\nKeeperFX is a fan project that aims to keep Bullfrog's legendary strategy game alive and well. The website says the aim is to \"preserve and expand upon the original,\" while bringing with it improvements to the visuals and new features.\n\n\nImage via KeeperFX.\n\n\nIt does require an official copy of Dungeon Keeper in order to play the FX version – either through a disc (remember those?) or a downloaded copy of the Gold Edition – but the fan project itself is free.\n\n\nWhat's featured?\n\n\nHere's a quick list of what you'll find in KeeperFX: \n\n\n\nWindows 7/10/11 support\n\n\nHigher screen resolutions\n\n\nModernized controls\n\n\nMany bugfixes [sic]\n\n\nAdditional campaigns and maps\n\n\nNew level script commands\n\n\nNew creatures, textures and sprites\n\n\nMultiplayer\n\n\nAnd much more!\n\n\n\nIn short, it retains the general look and feel of the ol' D-to-the-K, but with some modern overhauls.\n\n\nSome of you may already be aware of KeeperFX as it's technically been around since 2008. However, the latest download represents build 1.0.0, aka the \"first full version.\" According to the site, \"all original Dungeon Keeper code has been rewritten\" and it's a fully open-source standalone game.\n\n\nFor those with nostalgia on the brain, this sounds like a neat way to experience a gaming relic of the past. And let's be honest, we haven't had much luck from the series since that awful, awful, Dungeon Keeper mobile game.\n\nThe post KeeperFX is a fan project that’s keeping Dungeon Keeper alive appeared first on Destructoid.",

Leave your comments down below.\n\n\nOh, you’re still here. That’s understandable. After all, I don’t think you needed me to tell you that Super Mario RPG is a fun game. This unique collaboration between Nintendo and Squaresoft garnered a devoted following almost immediately upon release, and that passion from its fans endures to this day. While this is technically the origin point that led to the Paper Mario and the Mario & Luigi series, Super Mario RPG remains one of the wackiest and most surreal games the mustached plumber has ever starred in. Quite frankly, it's a miracle we’re even seeing this game again at all.\n\n\nWhen I previe…",

You access him the same way, too – by buying fireworks and trading them with the little girl nearby in Moletown for a shiny stone.

The new OLED models (one at 512 GB and another at 1TB storage) effectively replace the original release as the new Steam Deck flagship hardware. The older 64 GB and 512 GB LCD models are being phased out, while the 256 GB LCD will remain available at a reduced price.\nSteam Deck OLED is not a fundamentally new platform. In many ways that matter, our review of the original still stands, and snagging one of the older LCD screen models is now an even more substantial value at the lower price.

In an era when Final Fantasy tried its best to tell mature stories within the medium's limitations and Dragon Quest demanded hours and hours of your time, Mario’s adventure felt much brighter and more manageable. Familiar characters, a lighthearted story, a reasonable length, and timed button-pressing during combat made it stand out against the competition. Revisiting the game more than 25 years later in this new remade shape shows the original formula did n…",

The news comes via Aftermath, which reports that the layoffs are focused in two areas – the Crown Twitch channel, which will reportedly be eliminated altogether, and the game growth teams. Employees were notified of the changes through an email from Christoph Hartman, VP of Amazon Games. This is the second wave of layoffs this division of the company has faced this year.\nAn excerpt of the announcement email can be read below:\nThere have been so many layoffs in the gaming industry this year that it's getting hard to keep track of. Last week, we learned Free Radical Design is on the verge of closing down and that Ubisoft laid off more than 100 employees. The week before that, roughly 100 employees were laid off at Destiny 2 developer Bungie. \nIn January, Microsoft laid off 10,000 employees amidst its ongoing $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which it completed last month. \nIn August, Striking Distance Studios, the team behind last year's The Callisto Protocol, laid off more than 30 employees, and that same month, Mass Effect and Dragon Age developer BioWare laid off 50 employees, including long-time studio veterans. The following month, in September, Immortals of Aveum developer Ascendant Studios laid off roughly 45% of its staff. \nJust last month, The Last of Us developer Naughty Dog laid off at least 25 employees, and Telltale Games underwent layoffs as well, although an actual number of laid-off employees has not yet been revealed. And in late October, Dreams developer Media Molecule laid off 20 employees.\nThe hearts of Game Informer's staff are with the people laid off from Amazon Games, along with everyone else who has lost a job this year.\n[Source: Aftermath]",

Spider-Man sees the friendly neighborhood hero battle a star-studded gallery of villains in an original adventure chock full of comic book goodness. As Spider-Man's first fully 3D action-adventure game, it laid the groundwork for mechanics such as web-swinging, a variety of web shooter attacks, and wall-crawling stealth gameplay.

The first season hit the subscription streaming service in November of 2021and now we know that Arcane Season 2 hits Netflix this time next year. \nMore specifically, Arcane Season 2 drops on Netflix in November of 2024. To coincide with the news, Netflix has released a short teaser featuring Jinx. Check it out below: \nArcane. Season 2.

As of August, Grand Theft Auto V has sold more than 185 million copies since its release 10 years ago. \nOfficial news of this trailer from the Rockstar Twitter account comes less than a day after a Bloomberg report that states Rockstar will reveal the sequel, presumably titled Grand Theft Auto VI or Grand Theft Auto 6, this week with a trailer for it arriving sometime next month; Since the release of this report yesterday, Rockstar has confirmed a trailer for the next Grand Theft Auto will, in fact, be released in December. \nWe are very excited to let you know that in early December, we will release the first trailer for the next Grand Theft Auto. We look forward to many more years of sharing these experiences with all of you.\nNovember 8, 2023\nGame Informer has reached out to Rockstar's parent company Take-Two Interactive to ask about this report and reveal and will update the story if more information is learned. \nThe journey to the reveal of the next Grand Theft Auto has not happened quietly. In September of last year, unprecedented leaks gave fans a potential look at the sequel in over 90 videos showcasing secret in-development footage of the open-world crime sequel.  We also learned last year that the game reportedly stars a female protagonist. Bloomberg says this Grand Theft Auto V sequel is set in a fictional version of Miami and features the aforementioned female protagonist as well as a male protagonist. \n\n\nWhile waiting to learn more about Rockstar's next game, read Game Informer's Grand Theft Auto V review and then read our thoughts on Red Dead Redemption II. After that, read Game Informer's ranking of every single Rockstar game. \nWhat do you want to see most in the next Grand Theft Auto? Let us know in the comments below!",

The cuts included administrative and IT workers, some of whom were employed at the Hybride VFX studio, a company that has worked on shows like Ahsoka and The Mandalorian.\n\n\n\"These are not decisions taken lightly and we are providing comprehensive support for our colleagues who will be leaving Ubisoft during this transition,\" the company told both IGN and Kotaku. \"We also want to share our utmost gratitude and respect for their many contributions to the company. This restructuring does not affect our production teams.\" Another quote obtained by Kotaku claims that the layoffs are to allow Ubisoft to \"to optimize its resources to be more sustainable in the long term.\"\nThis news comes after a year of several big Ubisoft releases, including Assassin's Creed Mirage, The Crew: Motorfest, and Just Dance 2024, but that's in spite of the fact that they canceled several games this year and delayed Skull and Bones... again. Unrest at the company has been ongoing as well: back in September, IGN reported widespread frustration after employees were suddenly called to return to in-person working conditions.\nUbisoft now joins Bungie, Media Molecule, Telltale Games, Team17, Epic Games, Naughty Dog, Microsoft, and more on the unfortunately long list of companies that have laid people off in the past year.\n[Sources: IGN, Kotaku]",

Resident Evil Village hit the App Store just last week, and today, Capcom has let us know when Resident Evil 4 Remake is coming to the platform: December 20. You can see some screenshots from the Apple port below. \n\nThe game won't be available to all iPhone owners, however. Resident Evil 4 Remake will only be available on the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, meaning you'll have to grab the newest product in order to play this game on the go. That said, it will also be available on iPads and Macs with the M1 chip or later. If you're a diehard Apple fan and have multiple RE4 Remake compatible products, you'll be happy to know that the game also supports cross-progression between Apple devices, so you can start a save file on your Mac at home and pick it up on your phone when you're on the go.\nThe game is available for pre-order on the App Store now, but players will be able to start the game for free before committing to a full purchase. Its recently released DLC, Separate Ways, will launch alongside it as well.

Only the DOS version of the game (available on gog.com) is supported. It's a cartoon FMV game, with an inventory, in which you have to guide Lathan Kandor through a medieval world, discovering the magic spells and the items required to defeat an evil wizard. \nEscape From Hell, was developed for Electronic Arts by the game veterans Richard Seaborne and Alan Murphy and was released in 1990. You play Alan in this keyboard-only Role Playing Game and visit Hell, looking for your girlfriend who was accidentally teleported there.\nBoth games use heavily hardcoded logic which is error prone and requires a lot of testing, so we need your feedback more than ever as they are both incompletely tested. There is sadly only one known demo for Kingdom. Support for the Windows and Mac versions of Kingdom may come later! Please contact us if you have some other demos of both games.\nTo play any of these games, you will need a daily development build.
