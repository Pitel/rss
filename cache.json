Saber and Focus Home have released an extended trailer that walks you through two major modes - the PvE boss and wave-slaying frenzy of Operations, and the 12-player PvP carnage of Eternal War, which spans a range of match types.

In that time, many other survival games have sprouted, blossomed, and gently faded away. I first visited the burnt-out ruins of this zombie-infested world a decade ago and I returned to it this week to find a tree-puncher that, despite bearing the pockmarks of early access, retains much of what made it enjoyable back when the survival genre was still wearing its baby onesie. Instead of a review, I figured I'd scribble together a mini starter guide for new (or returning) players. Partly because the game is a proper time sink and it was taking me so long to get through everything. But mostly because I wanted to use that numberful headline. So, here you go: 7 dos and 7 don'ts in 7 Days To (7) Die.\nRead more",

          "description": "I was partial to a scrappy little strategy game even before idiot billionaires doomed the planet, and the UK to brain-steaming heat just when you thought we'd escape it this year. Khaligrad is plenty scrappy. Its edges are rough and you have to figure it out yourself, but it's more intuitive than it appears, and easy to operate once you discern some basics. It's scrappy too in that it's, well. It's Stalingrad. Not really: its world is so fictional it's their 15th century. But the invaders are explicitly fascists and the defenders communists embroiled in a long and brutal semi-guerrilla city war with World War 2 technology. Thankfully, it's stripped of any actual fashy or genocidal play-acting beyond each side doing \"hail the empire/union\" bits as a sign off.\nI think that's why, despite its brutal and difficult setting, it's this year's entry in the long tradition of Low-Intensity Strategy Games For When Hot Why Hot Please Stop You Cannot See My Begging Tears For They Evaporate.\nRead more",

The new game - currently untitled and without a release date - is a first-person sci-fi RPG set in an alternate-1900s North America, which ostensibly combines the ingenuity and gadgetry of Dishonored and Prey with a \"real RPG\" experience redolent of Skyrim and modern-day Fallout.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's got a default jump range of 17.55 light years and two big prongs sticking out of its face like a sci-fi forklift. Cool. The catch is that this ship can only be bought with real money for now, say the developers. This is part of Frontier's new strategy of having paid-for ships in the game. I don't really play Elite Dangerous anymore, so I don't have strong feelings about that. But I do have strong feelings about the space trucker advertisement the developer has put together for the new ship. Come watch it with me.\nRead more",

The supermarket chain – third biggest in the UK by turnover and purveyors of ill-fitting clothes and surprisingly good doughnuts alike – has added light-up gaming mice, keyboards, and headsets to its mountain of own-brand wares.\nAsda being what it is (Americans, if you’re unfamiliar, think Walmart with less gun violence), it’s all dirt cheap as well. £17 for a full-size keyboard. £16 for an FPS mouse. Overwhelmed with curiosity, I ended up taking home a complete starter set (keeb, different mouse, headset, and mousemat) for £45, or about a third of the price of the Logitech G515 Lightspeed TKL that I’d shortly kick off my desk. Could this be a new frontier in affordable PC hardware, bringing tech to the masses in a way no specialist retailer ever could, or should supermarkets stick to cereal and meal deals?

          "description": "Back in June, strategy bods Creative Assembly put out a chunky, chatty video discussing the next expansion for Total War: Warhammer 3. Aside from a not-so-subtle hint that the orcs, ogres, and Khorne pack would feature at least one colossal squig, it also ended with a tease at smaller bits of new content coming alongside regular patches. As of the game’s latest hotfix blog, we’ve now got a better idea when we’ll start seeing some of these “smaller bits and pieces.” Bits and pieces? In this economy? Yes, and this month in fact. “Late August” to be precise by quoting a vague statement precisely.\nRead more",

The game festering beneath is actually a \"plant horror\" boss rusher with twin stick melee controls, unlockable \"Instinct\" abilities and one-hit deaths.\nIn a gift to headline writers everywhere, the developers, four-person Gardenfiend Games, are calling it \"Hollow Knight meets Titan Souls\", and who am I to deny them? It's got one of those \"painterly\" art styles, too, though other words come to mind, such as \"rotted\" and \"unhallowed\" and \"manky\". It's out on 6th September.

Leaves flutter, rays of sun cavort through trees, and the music is utterly gorgeous. The game opens on twinkly piano and mournful strings, infused with a good dose of stirring JRPG whimsy, and soon transforms into whatever the genre of music is called that makes you want to immediately go on a massive adventure.

I dunno about that, though between the Asus ROG Ally X and the Steam Deck OLED, those who stayed their hand on their earlier handheld gaming PC counterparts do have a couple of quality second-genners to choose from. Valve’s effort manages to wring multiple performance, design, and battery life improvements out of its new display, while the ROG Ally X makes similar upgrades with a bigger-yet-better take on the original ROG Ally.\nThe only thing to do, clearly, is make them fight. It’s probably in the Irish Code Duello or something: \"Should one portable games box impugn another’s honour by releasing shortly after it, satisfaction must be claimed through a comparison article.\" My hands are bound here, folks, though if you yourself have been playing the waiting game on a handheld purchase, perhaps this little head-to-head can help you pick the right one.\nRead more",

You awake to a world of tree trunks that twist like viscera and corroded contraptions powered by luminous goop that’s stored in the balls, uh, big glass orbs. A beam of light soon fills your character with newfound vigour, which is a nice moment of triumph in what otherwise feels like a deeply oppressive rust pit, all unsteady platforms and jagged pipes.\nIt doesn’t take long before you start spotting examples of the reason Bionic Bay went viral earlier this week. Above your head hangs a painstakingly detailed mass of vents and cables, looming lifelike with dust and shadow and history. I stood and stared because I’d seen how the sausage was made, but I like to think I would have lingered longer than usual anyway. It really is just that impressive.\nRead more",

So if there's only one person in your village who knows how to brew tastier beer, and they die after being freakishly savaged by a passing wolf (it happens), suddenly your village will have no artisanal lager master. The results may be devastating. Luckily, you can share knowledge in a number of ways - by copying books, or having \"wise conversations\". The exception to this is child characters, whose pea-sized brains can't learn specialist knowledge, only soaking up basic attributes like \"manners\" from the teachers you assign to them. Well, until now. The developers for the Rimworld-meets-Crusader Kings catastrophe simulator have made kids a little smarter. They'll now learn more important things from their adult teachers.\nRead more",

It seems just yesterday I was getting very jealous at Matthew Castle (RPS in peace) for getting to preview the sequel to my beloved Shadows Of Amn. Fast forward several turns, Larian’s RPG banger is officially one year old since release, and there’s now a much higher chance that strangers at pubs will understand why my failed romance with Jaheira as a youth was such a deeply heartbreaking experience. Baldur’s Gate 3 itself looks to be done and dusted following the upcoming patch, but Larian now seem to be gearing up for their next charm offensive with a new “community focused” YouTube channel, as well as further teasing their two games currently in development.\nRead more",

Watching THQ Nordic's new Gothic Remake trailer, below, feels a little like watching a vivisectionist parade about in somebody else's skin. Still, the remake's developers Alkimia Interactive aren't to blame for Embracer's fuck-ups, and I am selfishly happy to see Gothic return as an Unreal Engine 5 production - even if I didn't play the original back in 2001.\r\n\n\r\nSin did play the original game, and in her 2016 retrospective, she paints an absorbing picture of a dark fantasy \"microsociety\" in which every community \"has a reason to exist, a means of providing for itself, a social order, and a long term goal\".

World Of Goo 2 pursues that sense of novelty with just as much twitchy eagerness as its predecessor, throwing new toys and goos at the player in an effort to keep you on your sludge-coated toes.

Specifically, laidback intercity services with nobody else in the quiet car and certainly, none of those screeching smaller bipeds, or \"children\" as they are scientifically known. That idyll is now lost to me thanks to Covid: I have vulnerable family members and continue to be careful about social distancing. As such I spend most train journeys these days lurking between carriages, trolling the door sensors and scowling furiously at anybody who visits the loo. But now, thanks to the obscene magic of video games, I can get my fill of authorial locomotivation once again.\nRead more",

In a pastime that’s had several decades to perfect the art of hitting men with sharp objects, that’s quite the accomplishment. Since releasing in 2022, Torn Banner have lavished the player base with free horses, angry peasants, and most recently, the Regicide update - hosting a climatic tete-a-tete between two angry crownmen. With work on No More Room In Hell 2 well underway though, Torn Banner have decided to call it on Chiv 2, which they now consider “feature complete.”\n \nRead more",

It's possible, however, that Overwatch 2 will swing back in the other direction, as Blizzard are now \"exploring how we can test different forms of 6v6 in the game to gauge the results\", with a view to restoring some of the joyful chaos that saw entire teams of Reinhardts charging the objective in formation.\n Read more",

The AMD Ryzen 9000 series starting with the Ryzen 5 9600X and Ryzen 7 9700X launching tomorrow are some truly great desktop processors. The generational uplift is very compelling, even in single-threaded Linux workloads shooting ahead of Intel's 14th Gen Core competition, across nearly 400 benchmarks these new Zen 5 desktop CPUs impress, and these new Zen 5 desktop processors are priced competitively. I was already loving the Ryzen 7000 series performance on Linux with its AVX-512 implementation and performing so well across hundreds of different Linux workloads but now with the AMD Ryzen 9000 series, AMD is hitting it out of the ball park. That paired with the issues Intel is currently experiencing for the Intel Core 13th/14th Gen CPUs and the ~400 benchmark results makes this a home run for AMD on the desktop side with only some minor Linux caveats.",

Even consoles that should have been able to play the game well couldn’t without severe drawbacks. The SNES version had many, making it pale in comparison to the original DOS version, but it held up a smidge better than some others. It was rather impressive that it would even run on the platform, though it needed some assistance from Nintendo’s proprietary FX Chip.\n\n\n\n\nI loved Doom when I was a wee tot, but my parents wouldn’t buy me the PC version. It wasn’t because of the violence, however, but rather t…",

          "description": "Roguelite deck builder is pretty far from my favorite genre. I’ve enjoyed some of them, but I wouldn’t actively seek out a new one. Rogue Light Deck Builder, on the other hand…\n\n\nThat’s because Rogue Light Deck Builder is about building a deck. Not a deck of cards, but more like something you’d put furniture on so you can stare at your neighbors. However, there are roguelite elements.\n\n\nYou’re given $1,000,000, a hammer, and a husband. You must construct a deck. The light isn’t very reliable. Your aim with a hammer is deplorable. But the deck must be built.\n\n\n\n\nWhile Rogue Light Deck Builder is just coming to my attention now and is coming to Steam soon, it’s been out on itch.io for a decent while. It’s $2, and the blurb suggests it will last around 20-30 minutes. I could have probably played this in preparation for this article, but I didn’t. I’ll likely grab it soon, but I like to write like I live my life: uninformed and bewildered.\n\n\nThe grotesque Unreal 5 visual style really appeals to me for some reason. It reminds me of a similar FPS about Presidents fighting weird monsters that I can’t remember the name of. This is why I should write about everything I play, then I’d have a record of it. Instead, I can just clearly remember the game but can’t recall the name. GoblinAmerica! That was it.\n\n\nOh, wait. It’s the same guy. The visual style is so evocative because Gil Lawson is the developer behind Rogue Light Deck Builder and GoblinAmerica. I can either consider this a really dumb moment because I didn’t realize it or give myself credit for being able to recognize a shared aesthetic. My brain will probably lean toward the former.\n\n\nAnyway, you can get Rogue Light Deck Builder on PC via itch.io right now, but it’s coming to Steam soon. Take a peek at the demo for GoblinAmerica, while you’re at it.\n\nThe post Rogue Light Deck Builder is not about the kind of deck you’re thinking of appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "An incredibly underrated fighting game, DNF Duel, is currently free-to-own on the Epic Games Store right now. It may not have many players now, but I still think it is worth playing.\n\n\nIt is being offered alongside CYGNI: All Guns Blazing, a visually intriguing shoot 'em up, and the Conduit Free Unlock Bundle for Apex Legends, which grants you the Legend Conduit for free, plus a skin. They are all free-to-own forever, as long as you claim them before August 15 at 4 pm BST / 11 am ET/ 8 am PT.\n\n\nBut why should you play DNF Duel (besides that it's free)? Sit down and let me tell you.\n\n\nIt's actually published by Arc System Works, makers of Guilty Gear, so of course it has an awesome anime art style with a deep fighting system. I enjoy ArcSys games, so I picked it up back when it came out in 2022 and loved the heck out of it.\n\n\nOne of the main mechanics of the game is being able to use simple direction inputs for moves – think Super Smash Bros. However, if you prefer traditional fighting game controls, those are available as well, and will even reward you with more damage. It's an input style that's become more popular in recent years, expanding across a bunch of different fighting games including Street Fighter 6.\n\n\nWe here at Destructoid thought it was an easy-to-learn hard-to-master fighting game, but worried about its longevity. And while its online servers aren’t super populated right now, it still has a niche community and had a community tournament at EVO 2024.\n\n\nI still highly recommend trying it out if you are a newcomer to fighting games. Maybe just find a Discord or group that plays together, if you are planning on playing online. Plus, if you enjoy it, there are five DLC characters that are also on sale for 50% right now to expand the roster.\n\nThe post DNF Duel is free again on the Epic Game Store appeared first on Destructoid.",

If you are a fan of Doom, you probably already own every game in the series six times over and don’t need something like the Doom Anthology. That is unless you want to own a 5” replica BFG.\n\n\nLet’s be clear here: this is the Doom (2016) BFG9000 that carried over into Doom Eternal. I would be very interested to get my hands on a replica of the original Doom (1993) BFG9000. The game depicts that particular weapon from the top and from the side and I still have no idea what it’s supposed to look like. It looks like you’re holding a spaceship, and I would like an explanation.\n\n\nAt 5”, the replica is unfortunately not the actual size of a BFG, so it is for display purposes only. You’re going t…",

          "description": "Gear up for more Borderlands, as Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford has said that the company is working on a new entry, alongside a new Brothers in Arms and more. As the Borderlands movie reportedly stinks up theaters, a \"new mainline title\" has been teased by Pitchford during an Epic Games interview published Thursday. \n\n\nWhen asked if Gearbox is working on the next \"mainline\" game in the Borderlands series, Pitchford replied: \"Of course we are.” \n\n\nThat's not it, either. While discussing the new Borderlands movie that is available in theatres this weekend, Pitchford teased to Epic Games that multiple projects are in development, thanks to a \"leadership cluster,\" which \"drives a project from cradle to grave.\" \n\n\n“With this approach, we’re able to spin up multiple things, including a new Brothers in Arms game, which has been in development for a while—but we’re not yet ready to talk about it,\" said Pitchford. Perhaps, we could see this project announced during The Game Awards this year. The Brothers in Arms series had a TV show in the works in 2020 as well, and there have been mentions of a new entry in the series over the years.\n\n\nDuke Nukem is also referenced during the interview. \"We’re working on every IP. I mean, we just launched Homeworld 3, and there’s still work going on there,\" Pitchford said. \"And there’s Risk of Rain, and there’s Duke Nukem, and there’s more.”\n\n\nThe latest entry in the Borderlands series was the spinoff Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, which was received relatively well by critics and fans. \"Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands is more Borderlands, and the lighter fantasy fare might actually get people to dive in for the first time,\" said our review. \"With that in mind, it’s still more Borderlands, so the same basic formula isn’t going to magically change your stance if you’re a lapsed fan.\"\n\nThe post A new Borderlands is being worked on, says Gearbox CEO appeared first on Destructoid.",

Well, I’ve gone down as far as I can and discovered everything there is to be found inside the Mines, so let’s look at what I’ve found. \n\n\nWhen you interact with the elevator within the Mines in Mistria, it looks like there should be a total of 100 levels. However, Fields of Mistria has only just been released into Early Access and currently, there are only 60 levels to explore. \n\n\nUpon reaching floor 60 of the Mines, you’ll encounter the Priestess again only to be told that you cannot go any further and you must wait. There’s another unnamed Seal on floor 60, just like those on floor 20 and floor 40, although you’re unable to even discover which items you need to find in order to break through it let alone handing them over and getting through the door.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nWill more floors be added to the Mines in Fields of Mistria?\n\n\nAccording to the Early Access roadmap released by RPG Studios, there will indeed be new biomes coming to the Mines, although it’s not clear when this will happen. \n\n\nThe new biomes aren’t coming as part of the first major planned update, which is expected to arrive at some point before 2024 is over, but it is detailed in the ‘future updates’ section of the roadmap. \n\n\nImage via NPC Studios\n\n\nIf I were to guess, judging from the floor 60 Seal room, I expect the floors post this latest seal to be filled with Gold and volcanic resources just begging to be used in our crafting endeavors. \n\n\nUntil we can get through the door, though, the Mines are still worth diving into whenever you’re at a loss for what to do. Not only are there valuable resources inside, but you’ll also need to keep going inside to increase both your Mining and Combat levels to unlock new perks. \n\nThe post How deep do the Mines go in Fields of Mistria? appeared first on Destructoid.",
