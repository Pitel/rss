Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown will run at 60fps on the Switch, both handheld and docked. This was stated by The Game Awards' host Geoff Keighley way back in the summer of 2023, but it's good to get the official word.

Did you know that the gaming industry is bigger than Hollywood? Yes, Steve. Everyone knows that.\nDespite this, the mainstream stereotype is largely still that gamers are socially-challenged dweebs who need to get out more. You'd think that people would know better by now — and in some cases, it's difficult to imagine how they don't know better — but here we are; still being told to take a shower, leave the house, touch grass, and expand our horizons beyond a high score and a flagpole.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

That's still technically true, but according to new GfK data, it was actually the highest-selling game on a single platform; EA Sports FC 24 beat it simply thanks to combined sales across multiple consoles.

          "description": "Hideo Kojima's new Xbox Game Studios project OD is a horror game that is \"also a movie, and at the same time a new form of media\" and who knows, perhaps it also runs on solar power. That's the extremely direct and literal reading of Kojima's latest social media tease, in which he compares his latest endeavour to Boktai: The Sun Is In Your Hand, an isometric vampire-hunting game for Game Boy Advance, which Kojima worked on while at Konami in the early noughties. Boktai stands apart to this day for making use of solar energy. There's a sun sensor built into the cartridge, which allows you to re-energise your weapon by using the console in sunlight, though this isn't outright necessary to prevail.\nI doubt OD employs a similar peripheral, though a Steam Deck verified horror game that can only be played outdoors in pleasant weather would be an... interestingly contrary experience. But it's an opportunity, at least, to jump aboard one of my personal hobby horses and give you a scrappy rundown of older and recent games that employ similar functionality.\nRead more",

Katharine says it's decent, however, and the latest trailers are intriguing. One is an overview of the new metroidvania's locations, of which you can read much more in Katharine's last preview. The other is a quick dive into the game's approach to accessibility, which appears to be a lot more holistic than you'll find in many games. \r\n \nRead more",

But take Russian Roulette, swap the revolver for a pump-action shotgun, mix up live and dud rounds, and add Inscryption-esque items which let you change the rules, and now you have a more skillful game.

The good news is that everyone seems to be taking a bit of a breather in 2024, because (at time of writing at least) the official \"big'uns\" calendar is looking remarkably slim at the moment. There are still some heavy-hitters coming our way this year, such as , Star Wars Outlaws and Path Of Exile 2, but 2024 looks like another year where it will be the smaller, independent games that shine the brightest. They certainly make up the bulk of our most anticipated games list for 2024, which the RPS Treehouse has been feverishly putting together over the last few days. The bad news is that there are still loads of great games coming out. So come, join us, and see what's on our personal wishlists for 2024.  \nRead more",

I was previously a snob about the Nancy Drew point and click puzzle games, and then came to regret it when a fan of them (very nicely) emailed me explaining they're actually really good. We're going to find out for ourselves by playing them. There are north of 30 in total, and I will update the rankings at the end of each article.\nThe first is 1998's Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill, in which Nancy solves the murder of a Floridian highschooler named Jake Roberts, and there's a lot to love about it right away. There's a restrained cast, three locations in total, and the school sports team is called the Fighting Manatees. Thus the icon for the game is a lil' cartoon manatee - and to be absolutely accurate, this is the remastered version of the game from 2010, not the original 90s version.

Often if you see a \"quick crossword\" in a UK paper that means \"crossword with clues that are general knowledge questions and not an archaic set of riddles - you know, for if you're waiting for the kettle to boil, or are an idiot\".

          "description": "Tim Cain wrote what is perhaps gaming’s most famous and influential monologue: the introduction to Fallout. “War never changes,” he says. “People loved it. I’m like, ‘I must be a writer.’” Yet much more recently, when Cain sat down to write his memoirs, nobody really liked what came out on the page. “I was really, really bad at it,” he says. “I had half a dozen people read it, and they all pretty much said that the stories were good, but my writing wasn’t.”\r\n\n\r\nCain’s writing strengths, as fellow Fallout originator Leonard Boyarsky has suggested, lie in shortform. Which was bad news for anyone who wanted to read the definitive account of his four decades at the heart of Interplay, Troika and Obsidian, three of the most important RPG studios of all time. Thankfully, though, it turns out Cain is a natural raconteur. The same anecdotes that appeared flat and toneless in his memoirs go down a storm on YouTube. There, for the past seven months, Cain has been delivering his stories straight to camera, as if at a dinner party with 73,500 other people. “When I started the channel, I would effectively just look at something in the book and be like, ‘I’ll tell that story today,’” he says. “Now I spend as much time answering questions and doing videos based on things people ask about.” \r\n\n \nRead more",

We can expect the Maw's petulance to mount during January, a lean month for announcements and revelations, but there are a few tasty morsels in the offing - a new Prince of Persia and Tekken 8, for instance. Fingers crossed we can build up some kind of momentum.\nSome new game releases we are pointing our telescopes at this week: Skeleton Rebellion (4th Jan), a scrappy offbeat RPG with claymation elements in which you are a skeleton trying to overthrow some mages, and The Night Is Grey (5th Jan), a point-and-click adventure about a beardy bloke and a little girl stuck in the woods with some weirdo wolves. If you like, you can also play a free drinking game I've just invented in which you do a shot for every time I accidentally write 2023 instead of 2024.\n Read more",

However, there are cheaper UK options if you're happy with a smaller, non-overclocked Palit card. Palit is more of a budget brand, but is built around the same Nvidia GPU and therefore offers the same performance. \nRead more",

It's a 2D roguelike in the vein of Dead Cells, where you battle through stages, power-up, try and get as far as you can, inevitably die, reinvest your winnings, power-up permanently, then go again. It saddens me that I've not seen much excitement for the game elsewhere, so here I am with a little pudding for you. A little treat. Here comes the plane, nyaaaooownnn.\nRead more",

I didn't play quite as many small, odd things as I would have liked in 2023.

Yet I still can't help but also see the Game Awards as something else: a sign of progress. That's because I remember the Spike Video Game Awards from 2007, which remains the nadir of both the games industry specifically and popular culture in general.\r\n\n \nRead more",

While I've only slapped one Bestest Best badge down in 2023 (woe is me), our lovely freelancers, current RPSers, and former RPSers have done a whole lot more badge-slapping. A grand total of 26 Bestest Bests have graced our monitors this year, which makes it three more than last year's Bestest Best round-up. And I'd say it's a nice mixture of big budget open worlders, puzzle gems, and indie delights that make up our roster for 2023, too.\nSo yeah, I'd encourage you to have a flick through the list below and see if there's anything you can add to the wishlist. Even as the person with \"Reviews\" in their job title, I can confirm I literally have loads of these Bestest Bests in my backlog. I will endeavour to play a handful over this Christmas break on my Steam Deck, maybe combining the experience with a nibble on a mince pie. Anyway, enjoy! And Merry Reviewsmas!\nRead more",

Prior to joining the RPS Treehouse in late October, I spent much of the year organising a massive international move with my family from the US to the UK, which meant that many of 2023's fresh releases - aside from the few that I've highlighted in this year's advent calendar - remained in the unplayed depths of my Steam list. Now that it's December and life has settled somewhat, I had to wrack my brain to come up with three entries for this Selection Box. After much deliberation, I realised that there were a few indie gems that I managed to crack open amidst all the chaos of arranging 60+ boxes for shipment across the Atlantic.\nRead more",

          "description": "In a year as stuffed with great games as this one, it was always inevitable that lots of very good ones would be left on the cutting room floor of our Advent Calendar this year. It's also perhaps no surprise that in the big spreadsheet of games I've played this year, I've set yet another new record for things I've played to completion. At time of writing, my list stands at 58 games for 2023, and by the time you're reading this in your post-Christmas lunch coma, I wouldn't be surprised if it had risen further. 58! That's more than one a week! Honestly, what was past Katharine thinking? No wonder I'm so chuffing tired right now.\nIn any case, my list of honourable mentions is so long this year I've taken the cheeky liberty of cramming some extra entries into my 2023 Selection Box, bringing you five more personal picks that I think are just smashing and that you should absolutely play when you get a spare moment or three.\nRead more",

          "description": "Hear ye! This month marked the 25th birthday of Thief: The Dark Project. While not as infinitely mutable as other 90’s icons like Doom (which just turned 30, and can be played on a pregnancy test), stealth gaming’s grandpappy has maintained an enduring appeal and influence, especially for those more inclined to sneaking than slaughter. Buckets of digital ink have already been spilt examining this legacy, so I won’t dive into the weeds of a hagiography. What I want to highlight is a major event that marked the 25th anniversary – one that makes today as great a time as any to explore Thief’s still-thriving mod scene.\r\n\n\r\nNotable: After a quarter-century, stealth fans were gifted a new, 10-mission Thief campaign called The Black Parade. Pitched as a prequel to the first game, it features a new protagonist, new story, and new heists, built by some of the most lauded modders on the scene. More notable still: The team lead is Romain Barrilliot, a fan-turned-pro designer at Arkane, where he, alongside other former Thief acolytes, iterates the immersive sim tenets in their patented im-sim laboratory. Mostest notablest?

It's one of many mysteries that surround the edifice, which I discovered during a holiday in the Cairngorms this August, while everybody else at RPS was writing about some tyrannous entity called Gamescom.\nFirst, the approach: having exited a vast pine forest of primeval aspect and supernatural disposition, with distant, daylit clearings leading the eye deeper and deeper into the undergrowth, till it feels at last as though your gaze has become tangibly enmeshed with clutching root and lowering branch - having finally escaped from that terrible, terrible forest, with its single, mournful stream crossed by a bridge of predatory bareness that is surely a haven for trolls, you set out across a grey and purple oblivion of reed and heather, a moorland rising to the border between glens, broken only by the stark red stain of a door. Nearing this otherworldly aberration, this scarlet phantasm, you realise that there is a house constructed around it, a sloping excrescence of withered planks and flaking plaster. What fell secrets could it harbour? Let us go and make our visit.\n Read more",

          "description": "Like a circus strongman's barbells, 2023's year in VR has been heavily weighted toward either end. The last twelve months were bookended with the launch of two excellent VR headsets (although only one is truly relevant to us PC gamers) and a whole bunch of great VR titles. The summer, however, was the quietest I've known for a long time, to the point where I ended up playing two VR minigolf games in the absence of anything better to do. Fortunately, the last few months have made up for it, providing enough fantastic VR games to feed us well into next year. So it's an unevenly weighted set of barbells, the kind that would give our moustachioed muscleman a slipped disk. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "The VR gaming realm appears to be struggling to gain its footing as yet another studio experiences problems. This time around it's Archiact which has announced it is going through layoffs. \n\n\nArchiact describes itself as \"one of the largest independent VR studios\" and it is behind VR titles like Doom 3: VR Edition, Freedriver: Triton Down, and Marvel Dimension of Heroes.  One of the latest titles it has released is Journey to Foundation which is inspired by Isaac Asimov's series. \n\n\n\n\nA reason for the layoffs was not given in the announcement, though it's stated that it wasn't an easy process. Archiact also asks for any fellow studios to reach out if they are hiring in numerous fields, which offers a glimpse at how many departments the layoffs affected, from Art and Animation to Engineering. \n\n\nArchiact doesn't struggle alone, as First Contact Entertainment has announced its closure. According to the developer, the closure was a product of a lack of \"lack of support for VR within the industry.\" This is a notable event for VR players, as the studio was one of the leaders when it comes to AAA VR experiences, as seen in titles such as Firewall Ultra. \n\n\nVR continues to be a tricky platform to master, even for companies as massive as Sony. Fortunately, those who enjoy the gaming experience aren't left without any new titles, as games like RE 4 Remake's VR mode and Tiger Blade continue to ensure VR libraries are never entirely empty. \n\nThe post Studio behind Doom 3 VR announces layoffs appeared first on Destructoid.",

While it’s still early in development, things look to be progressing well on the title.\n\n\nIf you’re unfamiliar, Buck Up and Drive, it’s similar to Out Run if it was taken to its furthest extremes. You not only race against time, but you also flip the hell out, performing absurd stunts that look like your car got stuck in the level geometry, and the physics don't know how to cope. There’s also drifting and rail-grinding, the normal sort of thing you’d expect from a racing game. It was part of my list of 2021 games you might have missed, which is what I did before just making the usual top 10 list every year.\n\n\n\n\nBuck Up and Drive 2 looks to be expanding on that. I’m not sure how that’s possible, but Fábio Fontes obviously has the answer: driving on walls. Do you remember the Spider-Mobile from the 1970’s Spider-Man comics? It’s a lot like that but less dumb. Also shown off is character customization. I’m not sure why, but I’ll take it.\n\n\nBuck Up and Drive 2 is built in the Godot Engine, probably because Fontes had a falling out with the GameMaker Engine following their move to a subscription model. Thankfully, the billboards have returned for the sequel. Some players complained about the original game’s common use of pride flags as billboards, so in response, Fontes added a “Pride Flag Billboard Toggle.” When toggled, it simply adds more pride flags.

          "description": "QUByte Interactive has announced that their upcoming collection of the Top Racer series has been pushed back from its January 11 release date, to the new target of March 7. In the meantime, a demo that includes three tracks will be available on Steam starting January 11.\n\n\n\n\nI knew these games as Top Gear. It was hard not to look at it as a kid since the cover features a car (possibly) driving away from an explosion. It was similar to Race Drivin’ in terms of its eye-catching cover, but unlike Race Drivin’, Top Gear is actually a decent series.\n\n\nCreated by Gremlin Games Studios, the series started out on 16-bit consoles as racing games that use a raster effect to depict a 3D-like road. It distinguishes itself from games like Out Run by having tracks that actually circle back on themselves, which was uncommon for the particular sub-genre. It also had more of a tournament racing feel with pitstops and ongoing rankings. It also had split-screen multi-player, kind of like Outrunners on Genesis, but not as terrible.\n\n\nThough Top Gear 2 was ported to other platforms, the series stayed faithful to Nintendo platforms for a long time. After three games on the SNES, the series shifted to N64, with Boss Studios and Midway handling Top Gear Rally.\n\n\nTop Racer Collection assembles Top Racer (Gear), Top Racer 2, and Top Racer 3000 into one package. On top of that, they’re including Top Racer Crossroads, which is a new title that features four new cars, including one that is plainly the Ferrari Testarossa featured in Out Run. I can dig it.\n\n\nTop Racer Collection launches March 7, 2024 for PC, Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.\n\nThe post Top Racer Collection delayed until March 7 appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, the Amazon-owned platform clearly has to deal with it, and a new policy update aims to clamp down on broadcasters casting their broads, so to speak.\n\n\n\n\nOver on the Twitch website, the company says that, as of yesterday, it'll be cracking down on any 'implied nudity.' As the post itself says:\n\n\n\nThis update is in response to a recent meta on Twitch in which streamers use black censor bars or other items to block their bodies or clothing, or position the camera frame such that the viewer is led to believe that the streamer is fully or partially nude.\n\n\n\n\nAs of January 3, streamers will be required to make sure there is no suggestion that they may be hiding obvious nudity. The update specifies that, where required, \"coverage must be fully opaque,\" adding that \"sheer or partially see-through clothing does not constitute coverage.\"\n\n\nAdults only...kind of\n\n\nGiven that Twitch is largely a place where people go to watch content creators play games or engage in creative activities, it stands to reason that sexual or adult content would not be encouraged.\n\n\nHowever, the site recently updated another policy, which introduced a new label for streams classed as having \"sexual content.\" This means content such as \"erotic dances\" and \"fictionalized\" nudity are allowed, providing they are correctly labeled. Full nudity...still a massive no-no, however. Also, streams of this nature are not present on the homepage.\n\n\nAs for the update to the attire policy, Twitch has made it clear that it does not want streamers to be presenting themselves with \"implied nudity.\" The post states that such content will have its label changed to a more appropriate one, while repeat offenses will \"lead to an enforcement action.\"\n\nThe post Twitch’s updated policy is cracking down on ‘implied nudity’ appeared first on Destructoid.",

The composer has also announced that plans to bring it to modern consoles are underway.\n\n\n\n\nEarthion is a scrolling shoot-’em-up in development for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive. While that is not entirely unique in these days of homebrew development, what makes Earthion special is that it’s being helmed by Yuzo Koshiro, the legendary composer behind games such as Streets of Rage and Revenge of Shinobi. While he did compositions for SNES games like Actraiser, Robotrek, and Super Adventure Island, he’s perhaps best known for his Genesis contributions. His company, Ancient Corp, beyond collaborating with other developers, also created Beyond Oasis for the console.\n\n\nThe company has been tinkering with Earthion as far back as 2022, with its big reveal happening at Tokyo Game Show 2023. There, Ancient demonstrated the game’s tremendous bosses and fancy scaling effects.\n\n\nWhile Koshiro has moved on to composing for modern platforms with games such as the Etrian Odyssey series, he hasn’t lost his appreciation for old hardware. For Ancient’s recent game, Gotta Protectors: Cart of Darkness, there’s a suite of DLC available that changes the soundtrack to versions arranged for various consoles. This includes not only PC-88 and Mega Drive platforms but even less common consoles such as the Wonderswan. It feels very fitting that his company would eventually go back and create and new game for an old console.\n\n\nEarthion is aiming for a Summer 2024 release (at the earliest) on Genesis/Mega Drive. Modern console versions are planned, but none have been confirmed. Physical distribution in the West will be handled by Limited Run Games.\n\nThe post Yuzo Koshiro’s Genesis/Mega Drive game Earthion releases Summer at the earliest appeared first on Destructoid.",

To keep things from getting messy, you'll also get a removable crumb tray and non-stick-coated plates. \n\n\nSome high-tech features include a digital LED countdown timer as well as the ability to keep a list of the different preferred settings of household members. At $39.99, it's not out of reach for the sufficiently motivated Xbox fan. \n\n\nTo complete the Xboxification of your life, throw in the Xbox Mastercard as well as the Wonka-inspired console and controller. \n\nThe post Xbox Series S toaster available at Walmart appeared first on Destructoid.",

It was, by most accounts, a rousing success. But there was still room to grow.\n\n\nLike a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, then, seems like even more like a passing of the torch than its predecessor. And it was this shared custody of the spotlight that made me a bit nervous, going into a preview session way back in October. How would the focus manage both Kiryu and Ichiban?

It went from being the most anticipated game of this generation to boring the pants off players to winning a Steam Award (though some are curious as to how that came to be). In any case, it hasn't quite gone away yet, and the modding community is still engaging with it.\n\n\nOne such example comes from user Korodic, who's attempting to put something into Starfield that Bethesda never did. It's mechs. I'm talking about being able to control giant mechs. To be honest, the title of this article sort of gave it away.\n\n\n\n\nThe above video shows the current work-in-progress, in which the player can pilot one of these huge machines, rather than them being stationary models, as the developer intended. At the moment, there doesn't seem to be any release date for the mod, but it's worth keeping an eye on if you are still playing the game.\n\n\nSo much potential seemingly wasted\n\n\nI can't in all good conscience say that Starfield is a bad game. It's just not what people were hoping for. More fool us, perhaps? But the fact that it currently has a \"Mostly Negative\" score on Steam shows just how far it's fallen since it was released last September.\n\n\nOf course, the story's not over yet. Bethesda has plans to bring some new elements to Skyrim-in-space. An end-of-year update on the official website suggests 2024 will be Starfield's year.\n\n\nWith updates inbound \"roughly every six weeks\" starting next month and some intriguing implementations being teased, Todd Howard seems determined to make sure you enjoy the game he's been dying to make for two and a half decades.

The vanilla release just doesn't seem to cut it these days for a lot of fans, so the modding community has dedicated itself to making TES5 as brilliant, everlasting, and immersive as all get out.\n\n\nWith that in mind, Nexus Mods user JaySerpa is back once more with further Skyrim improvements. This time, they've made it so NPCs react to being attacked by one of their friends. The video below shows it in action.\n\n\n\n\nEssentially, when you use a Frenzy spell – which temporarily turns enemies against each other – there's no vocal reaction to what's happening. This mod, however, uses spliced and vanilla dialogue from the game to make NPCs actually care an ally has turned against them. You can download it here (as the creator says, it's a measly 7MB, so you may as well).\n\n\n\"No! We've been betrayed!\"\n\n\nSome of you who are very familiar with the Skyrim modding scene will likely know JaySerpa's work. Fresh off their recent Christmas mod, this latest effort is yet another way of injecting that extra bit of immersion into the aging RPG.\n\n\nIt's also one of the reasons TES5 is still going strong after all these years. It's highly unlikely the game would enjoy such longevity without the community tweaking the base release, keeping things fresh for who knows how long.\n\n\nWhether The Elder Scrolls 6 will get the same modding treatment remains to be seen, but let's not get ahead of ourselves just yet. Bethesda still hasn't given us an update on its whereabouts or development stage.\n\nThe post Skyrim mod makes NPCs react realistically to friendly fire appeared first on Destructoid.",

It is being released in chapters, with the first two out already. A recent progress report on Steam lets fans know what's happening with the game's development. \n\n\nFor the sake of communication, the plan is to have a progress report out on the first week of each month. Following the release of patch 2.0.9, work still needs to be done on the technical side, including a pending audio playback fix. It was postponed because it \"needs more stress testing,\" so it may arrive in the next patch instead. \n\n\nThere is a pair of quality-of-life features being evaluated. The first concerns better saved game labels, and the other is a chapter select menu. No confirmation is given on when you can expect these improvements to be released because they need \"to be very thoroughly tested to avoid breaking game data as much as possible.\n\n\nThe update also addresses questions some have had concerning the different possible episode 2 endings.

On Twitter, Mintrocket announced that the game has sold 3 million copies globally.\n\n\nThis is certainly an achievement to be proud of, but it is far from the only thing the studio has to celebrate. Dave the Diver recently won the Sit Back and Relax award at The Steam Awards, and found itself nominated at both The Golden Joystick Awards and The Game Awards 2023. Our own Christine Choi gave the game a 9/10, praising its ability to \"offer a lighthearted story and engaging gameplay.\" \n\n\n\n\nDespite the accolades, the game has attracted some controversy due to frequently being labeled an indie title, including at The Game Awards. Although Mintrocket is a smaller studio, it falls under the billion-dollar corporation Nexon, which brings the game's indie status into question.

With the headliners of the month being Assassin's Creed Valhalla and Resident Evil 2.\n\n\nOne title, Close to the Sun, is out now for Game Pass owners. The rest will be spread out through the rest of January. Close to the Sun is a first-person adventure game from 2019 that has a bit of a Bioshock feel to it. It earned a 75 on Metacritic upon release, with critics coming away impressed for the most part with its atmosphere and story. \n\n\n\n\nFollowing that is Hell Let Loose, which arrives January 4.

          "description": "Kinetic Games is greeting the New Year with an updated roadmap for Phasmophobia. \n\n\nThis Roadmap is a little unusual in the sense that it only features milestones but lacks any release windows. The announcement shows the planned feature updates through to the 1.0 release from early access, but doesn’t really give any idea as to what the timeline is. This isn’t even a 2024 roadmap. It’s for 2024 and beyond.\n\n\nImage via Kinetic Games\n\n\nNonetheless, it gives you an idea of what needs to be done before the developer considers it complete enough to call it done. This includes lighting updates in 0.9 (which arrives next week after the holiday event ends), new tasks in 0.10, new play models in 0.11, and further overhauls in the 1.0 release. Beyond this is also the console release, the Point Hope map, and other maps beyond that, which are planned for release as they’re done rather than being packed with major updates.\n\n\nBeyond the roadmap, Kinetic Games’ announcement includes information about the Point Hope Lighthouse map, showing off the bathroom and the basement workshop. Also discussed is the changes happening to the two farmhouse maps. Previously, they were too similar (I couldn’t even tell you which is which), but they plan on giving both of them their own individual flourishes. Mainly, a number of rooms are being converted to having specific purposes. Grafton will also be made to look more rundown, while Bleasdale will be the opposite, being made more posh and ostentatious.\n\n\nWhile a timeline for these updates isn’t given, we do know that 0.9 will be arriving next week. I can certainly understand why they wouldn’t want to make promises after development on the game was upended by an office fire last year. \n\n\nPhasmophobia is currently available on PC via Early Access. The Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PSVR2 versions have been delayed to an unspecified date.\n\nThe post Phasmophobia roadmap outlines Point Hope Lighthouse update and path to 1.0 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Long-time players of The Elder Scrolls series will need no introduction to Daggerfall, the second entry in Bethesda's fantasy franchise. However, if you have never played this absolute classic – albeit wholly retro-looking – RPG, now's the perfect time.\n\n\nYou see, the Daggerfall Unity project has finally released version 1.0 of this unofficial remake (thanks, PCGamesN), which you can download from GitHub. Intended as a more stable release of previous builds, this update represents the next stage of a recreation that's been ongoing for a few years.\n\n\n\n\nYes, some of you may scoff at the fact that this was made in the Unity engine. But you may take some comfort in knowing that it was made long before the debacle that saw the company's reputation take a nosedive.\n\n\nAgain, free to download\n\n\nWhile The Elder Scrolls 2 is free to play through Steam, many would recommend the Unity version instead. It's a complete remake of the original 1996 release, done from the group up, but it doesn't lose its classic aesthetic and gameplay. It's simply been rebuilt in a different engine.\n\n\nThe visuals have been given a spit shine, but it still looks like a 90s DOS game. Add onto that Daggerfall Unity supporting mods, of which there are plenty to choose from, and it should make for a good time. \n\n\nWhile Skyrim is the one most people think of when it comes to TES, older gamers such as myself fondly recall some of the more dated installments. \n\n\nTrue, going back to their original iterations can be hard work on modern systems, but the Unity remake of Daggerfall is easily the definitive way to check out this legendary RPG. Especially now the full release is out. If you're at least interested, check out this rundown on changes and improvements in more detail. \n\nThe post If you haven’t checked out the remaster of Elder Scrolls 2, now’s the time appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "A Baldur's Gate 3 player has reportedly been banned for sharing their Xbox gameplay recording, as the footage automatically uploaded contained nude, in-game character models. \n\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 hasn't been out on the Xbox longer than a month, so this could be one of those BG3 oopsies, but it seems to come down to Xbox's own Terms of Service. Reddit user Daddy-Vegas claimed that one of his clips, fittingly named \"naked camp time fun,\" landed him a ban lasting until the end of the year — yes, of the year that has just begun.\n\n\n\n\nIn an interview with DualShockers, Vegas explains that his clips were automatically shared to the Xbox public feed and that the ban occurred just a few seconds after the upload's completion. This left Vegas very little time to react to his malfeasance.\n\n\nAccording to Vegas, he didn't intend to share the footage, but the console settings upload these by default  — you have to change the option yourself if you've got recordings that may violate ToS. The Xbox probably should not have that feature on by default or create a mature tag for this content, in case it finds it worthy of a ban. \n\n\nNaturally, players shouldn't have to worry about a ban over recordings of completely normal playthroughs of a game they'd acquired legally, but there's more. It's the old double standard of gore being fine, but looking at a naked body is a big no-no. \n\n\nAnd it gets even stranger\n\n\nVegas' post caused many other Xbox users to complain about similar penalties issued by Xbox, penalties that aren't even necessarily BG3 or nudity-related. Reddit user lmaoolivia talks about being banned on similar grounds when playing Attack On Titan, a game that doesn't even feature full-frontal nudity.\n\n\n\n\nDestructoid has reached out to Microsoft and Larian Studios for comment, and will update this story should we hear back. \n\nThe post Recording nude Baldur’s Gate 3 characters might land you a ban on Xbox appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Whew! What a year it was. We saw The best Steam games of 2023 revealed – with some surprising results – countered by the tragic loss of a lot of studios and development teams. Above all, the last 12 months have shown the popularity of gaming is by no means dipping.\n\n\nAccording to recent data from SteamDB, 14,533 games were released on the Steam platform in 2023. With the exception of 2018, we can see this number has been on the rise since the early 2000s. According to the graph, October was the busiest month, with 1,324 titles released on the platform.\n\n\n\n\nGiven what we can see – and providing the data is indeed accurate – we can expect this figure to rise even further throughout this new year.\n\n\nDiamonds in the rough\n\n\nObviously, over 14,500 video game launches is a lot. But it's more than likely that many of these would have been obscure indie titles that perhaps didn't make much of an impact. But that's okay, the number alone shows that gaming – especially on PC – continues to be on the rise.\n\n\nActually, the indie scene did have quite an impact on the industry. The SteamDB chart shows that independent developers released a total of 6,408 games, which accounts for around 44% of all titles released last year. That and we got to see the enormous success of the likes of Lethal Company, which still holds a high position on Steam's Top Sellers (just behind Baldur's Gate 3, no less).\n\n\nIn short, 2023 saw a hell of a lot of video games being released on Steam. May it continue into 2024 and beyond.\n\nThe post More than 14,000 games were released on Steam in 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

The chance to revisit Vice City in the next installment of Rockstar's Goliath franchise is something many of us are looking forward to.

The trailer below teases what's to be expected in what's being called the Nextgen Edition.\n\n\n\n\nGoing off the description on YouTube, the developer is taking the 2002 Grand Theft Auto game and importing it into Rockstar's RAGE engine. More specifically, it looks as though this remake will use the GTA IV version.\n\n\nNo AI upscaling here, it would seem\n\n\nRevolution Team acknowledges the Definitive Edition, saying that this version of Vice City will be different, i.e. better.\n\n\n\nThe official remaster uses the Unreal Engine only for rendering, but the game’s physics engine is still RenderWare, released more than 20 years ago, with outdated mechanics and animations.\n\n\n\n\nThe project is expected to release sometime in 2025. Here's what else you can expect in the Nextgen Edition:\n\n\n\n• Improved version of the city from Definitive Edition\n• Improved weapons from Definitive Edition\n• All cars from the Xbox version of the game\n• Models of all characters and peds from the Xbox version of the game (with improved textures)\n• All original radio stations\n• Cut scenes from the original game\n• Design in the style of the original game\n• Neon on buildings from Vice City Stories\n• Additional fixes and improvements from the Revolution Team\n\n\n\nThe post In the wake of the GTA 6 reveal, an unofficial remake of Vice City is in the pipeline appeared first on Destructoid.",

Among the things the company reaffirmed was that Star Wars Outlaws is indeed coming this year.\n\n\nOddly though, when the blog was initially published, it specifically stated \"late 2024\" as the release window for Outlaws. However, a few hours later, the post was updated to remove \"late\" and now simply lists 2024. \n\n\nA lot to explore in 2024. \n\n\nNothing was really shared on the project other than a vague summation.  The blog simply teased that players will \"explore distinct planets across the galaxy, both iconic and new.\" \n\n\nWe were first introduced to the game when Ubisoft unveiled it during Xbox's 2023 Games Showcase. Set in the time period between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, Star Wars Outlaws revolves around the underground world of the franchise. You play as an outlaw scoundrel by the name of Kay Vess as she attempts a massive heist alongside her companion, Nix. \n\n\nDeveloped by Massive Entertainment, the title features a variety of different forms of gameplay. While it's primarily a third-person action-adventure project, you'll also encounter stealth, vehicular combat, space combat, and more.\n\n\nThe \"late 2024\" designation may have been removed from Disney's blog, but it's still probably safe to assume that's the targeted window for Outlaws at this point. For whatever reason, Disney and Ubisoft must just not be ready to formally list the game's release date as such. Regardless, there's little doubt we'll be seeing much more of Star Wars Outlaws in the near future.\n\nThe post Disney will release open world Star Wars Outlaws in 2024 appeared first on Destructoid.",

I generally feel grated by DLC that’s kind of slapped haphazardly onto a game without a lot of thought, and that’s not the case with Echoes of the Fallen. Instead, Echoes of the Fallen functions as a neat bonus endgame quest that culminates in the game's closest equivalent to a superboss.

Titled Seeds of Renewal, the update brings a handful of new content to the popular MMORPG as well as concludes the current storyline campaign of the Dragon Isles.\n\n\nImage via Blizzard\n\n\nWorldwide Dragonriding and Azerothian Archives and more\n\n\nOne of the most popular mechanics introduced in World of Warcraft: Dragonflight is Dragonriding. Currently, the feature is only accessible in the new expansion area, the Dragon Isles.  However, with the Seeds of Renewal update, Dragonriding is being expanded to be useable in all old-world continents where flying is available which includes most of Azeroth.\n\n\nA new system is also being added called the Azerothian Archives. Players will have the chance to deliver into the history and lore of the Dragon Isles and explore an iconic time before the expansion over Weekly Public Events at the Traitor's Rest. Solo and Group activities will be available and reward players with Battle Pets, Mounts, and a Transmog set.\n\n\nFans of Worgens and Genn Greymane, the King of Gilneas, will be happy to see the King finally attempt to reclaim the kingdom of Gilneas in the Seeds of Renewal update. Gilneas has long been abandoned after being invaded by the Forsaken and then ripped asunder by the Cataclysm in the World of Warcraft: Cataclysm expansion. Players will have the opportunity to aid King Greymane in retaking Gilneas.\n\n\nFinally, Follower Dungeons are being added in the Seeds of Renewal update as well. Players can enlist the help of NPC companions to clear through dungeons instead of doing so with other players. All eight Normal Dragonflight Dungeons will now automatically scale and fill between 1-4 AI players, with more dungeons to come in the future.\n\n\nThe World of Warcraft 10.2.5 Seeds of Renewal update is set to launch on January 16.\n\n\n\nThe post World of Warcraft 10.2.5 Seeds of Renewal is set to release January 16 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Focusing on technical rendering solutions as of late, Durante has now set his sights on a new kind of local multiplayer gaming.\n\n\nMore specifically, Durante's latest blog post, titled \"A New Approach to Local Multiplayer / Splitscreen Perspective With Raytracing,\" goes in-depth on Thoman's idea of leveraging raytracing to develop a new kind of hotseat multiplayer screen-sharing experience. Historically, hotseat games have relied on one of several different types of split-screen implementations.

          "description": "Consumer Softproducts’ follow-up to 2021’s shared fever dream, Cruelty Squad, is now listed on Steam. Psycho Patrol R is now available for wishlisting, though there is no announced release window.\n\n\nI had noticed Consumer Softproducts tinkering around with a mech game since the release of Cruelty Squad, but with such things, sometimes an end result is never seen. However, it’s looking more likely with the official name and fancy store page.\n\n\nPsycho Patrol R has you play as a federal police officer of the eponymous Psycho Patrol. You’re tasked with piloting a V-Stalker to solve “mental crime, among other things.” It bills itself as a “combination of high-intensity tactical FPS combat” and takes place in an open, non-linear world. You’re also able to customize the equipment on your stompy V-Stalker, which I think is an unwritten law in the world of mech games. It also appears that you will be spending some time outside of your robot womb and can engage in thrilling conversations about cryptocurrency with executives.\n\n\nRight now, it looks like Psycho Patrol R will tone down the garish and nauseatingly surreal colors of Cruelty Squad, but the game’s graphics still scream jank-pop. I think I might have been disappointed if it didn’t.\n\n\nI reviewed Cruelty Squad back in 2021. I called out its deliberately stilted gameplay, referring to it as “a purposeful desecration of the holy grounds of game design.” That was one of the first times I was quoted on Wikipedia, but the phrase was eventually expunged from the article to make room for more favorable acclamations. I meant it as a compliment. Cruelty Squad has been living in my brain ever since and is probably the source of trauma that has driven me into the arms of similar jank-pop titles.\n\n\nPsycho Patrol R is currently set for release on PC, though no release window has been stated.\n\nThe post Steam listing up for Psycho Patrol R, next game from Cruelty Squad dev appeared first on Destructoid.",

If you've ever played a Persona game, you're likely familiar with the \"opening movie,\" which is the awesome animated opening to the game set to what is typically the main theme song. Ahead of Persona 3 Reload's release next month, Atlus has released its opening movie, debuting a brand new track called \"Full Moon Full Life.\" \nIn it, we get a look at the main character and the rest of the cast, as well as Persona, Igor, and more. As you might expect, the opening movie retains the flashy and stylish animation Persona has become known for over the years, and no surprise, it looks great. Atlus notes the trailer contains violent and sensitive content, however, so be wary of that before pressing play. \nCheck out the Persona 3 Reload opening movie for yourself below: \n\n\nFor more about the game, check out Game Informer's hands-on preview of Persona 3 Reload and then read Game Informer's list of all upcoming video game remakes.

          "description": "The original Outcast was a PC-exclusive, 3D open-world action game that predated Grand Theft Auto III by two years. It was an innovative, well-regarded, but underplayed game about landing on an alien planet and trying to survive in the face of its dangerous fauna. A remake of that game, called Outcast: Second Contact, was released in 2017, but Outcast: A New Beginning is the long overdue, proper sequel to the cult classic.\nJoin Marcus Stewart and me as we check out what the game has to offer, which is primarily impressive jetpack mechanics that let you literally fly around the alien world at high speeds. Outcast: A New Beginning is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on March 15.\n\n\nHead over to Game Informer's YouTube channel for more previews, reviews, and discussions of new and upcoming games.

          "description": "PlayStation has released a promotional video highlighting some of the biggest games coming to its console this year. The video hypes both first and third-party releases, many of which already had release dates/windows, but it also casually confirms 2024 launches for two previously un-dated projects.\nSpecifically, the video labels Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and Silent Hill 2 as 2024 games. Both games, each a remake of their respective titles, had no launch window prior to today. But the video and the accompanying PlayStation Blog post confirm as much, which is a little surprising to see happen with relatively limited fanfare instead of Konami rolling out individual red carpets for each game's launch update. But if you're looking forward to playing either title, this is welcomed news nonetheless.\n\n\nSilent Hill 2 was announced in 2022 as a remake of the 2001 classic and is being developed by Bloober Team. The studio recently shared that work on the game was “progressing smoothly”, and it is a PlayStation 5 console exclusive (but will also launch on PC). \nMetal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is a Unreal Engine 5 remake of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. It was announced during a PlayStation Showcase last May, and Konami released its first in-engine gameplay footage last October. Despite its inclusion in today’s PlayStation video, Snake Eater is also coming to Xbox Series X/S and PC.",

Bread will never be the same again. \nFeast your eyes on the officially licensed Series S toaster, which is on sale now at Walmart. The novelty appliance boasts a wide slot to toast thick slices of bread, bagels, waffles, English muffins, and probably most PlayStation discs for the truly devoted. In a neat twist, the oven roasts the Xbox logo on the food itself to add a flavorful touch of corporate branding to your carb intake. \n\nThe toaster also sports a digital LED countdown timer, a six-setting shade selector dial for browning customization, a removable crumb tray, automatic temperature control, and a cool-touch exterior, among other perks. Though a cool appliance, I can’t help but wonder how many people will request a Series S as a gift from friends/family and receive this elaborately disguised kitchen accessory instead. \nThose interested can purchase the Xbox Series S toaster for $39.99.",

U.S.-based 13-year-old Willis Gibson just beat an unbeatable Tetris game that players have been attempting to complete since its release on the NES in 1989. \nOn January 1, Gibson reached level 157 of Tetris, a feat previously thought impossible. New techniques, like the \"hypertapping\" one discovered in 2010 by Thor Aackerlund (thanks, BBC), and \"rolling,\" discovered in 2021 according to IGN, allowed players to reach never before seen levels. Before that, getting past the thirties was all but impossible and now, Gibson has made it to level 157. As you can see in the video below, upon reaching that level, Tetris serves Gibson a kill screen – meaning it has crashed – ending his impossible run. \n\n\nIt took Gibson, who goes by Blue Scuti on YouTube, 38 minutes to reach this new kill screen. BBC reports that Gibson has been playing Tetris for about two years, or since he was 11. Alongside his achievement of reaching level 157, Gibson also obtained the new highest score for Tetris. \nIGN writes that players can theoretically make it to level 255, and players are already trying; they just have to get lucky and avoid the crash points from level 157 onward. Upon beating level 255, players are brought back to the first level. \nFor more, be sure to watch Gibson beat the record here, and then read about these Game Informer editors who beat six gaming world records. \n[Source: BBC, IGN]\nAre there any video game records you think you could beat?

Notably, Black starred as the villainous Bowser in The Super Mario Bros. Movie last year, giving us the instant-classic \"Peaches,\" too. \nFollowing that report, other outlets, like Variety, further confirmed that Black would be starring in Minecraft alongside previously announced cast members like Jason Momoa (Aquaman, Game of Thrones), Danielle Brooks (The Color Purple), and Emma Myers (Wednesday).

The studio announced this achievement on X today, alongside some new art from the game to celebrate the milestone. Selling 3 million units is no small feat, especially considering Dave the Diver is Mintrocket's first game. \nIn Dave the Diver, players control Dave as he dives during the day to find treasure, fish, complete quests, and more. At night, Dave runs a sushi restaurant, and the game mixes its adventure gameplay with its simulation gameplay really well – read more about that in Game Informer's Dave the Diver review. \n🌊3 million global sales of Dave the Diver!🤿\npic.twitter.com/YzfUSOrHxd\nJanuary 3, 2024\nDave the Diver received great word-of-mouth at the time of its PC release in June, bolstered further by a Switch release later in October. It also crossed over with indie hit Dredge last month. Shortly before that crossover, Dave the Diver picked up a nomination for Best Independent Game at The Game Awards 2023. \nHave you played Dave the Diver?

          "description": "Update: Earlier today, a Disney Parks blog pointed to Star Wars Outlaws releasing in late 2024, but the term \"late\" has now been removed from the post so that is now reads just 2024. Ubisoft also confirmed to Kotaku that, \"the timing was incorrect and has since been amended.\" So, Star Wars Outlaws' release window has moved from late 2024 back to some general time this year.\nOriginal story:\nStar Wars Outlaws, Ubisoft's upcoming open-world Star Wars game, has enjoyed a vague 2024 release window since it was revealed at an Xbox Showcase last year. However, a recent post on Disney's official park blog has given the game a more specific window. According to the blog, Star Wars Outlaws is releasing late 2024. The blog post, which is a collection of 24 exciting Disney-things happening in 2024 reads, \"And for Star Wars fans – Star Wars Outlaws, the open-world Star Wars game is set to release late this year.\"\nStar Wars Outlaws follows an original Star Wars character named Kay Vess and seeks to explore a character archetype of the Star Wars universe we haven't spent much time with in video games: the Han Solo-inspired scoundrel. In the game, Vess (who has no Jedi abilities as far as we know) must survive by her wits and her ability to talk (or blast) her way through difficult situations.\nFor more on Star Wars Outlaws, you can read our interview with the game's narrative director, Navid Khavari, where we covered topics like whether or not the game will have an overlap with Shadows of the Empire and if the team has been communicating with Respawn regarding its Jedi series of games. The game is planned for release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

This side-scrolling action platformer blends sci-fi with Chinese mythology and is Red Candle’s most ambitious project yet. This significant step forward affords an opportunity to look back on the studio’s young history, so we spoke with co-founder Vincent Yang to learn about how a small band of gamers in Taiwan formed one of the industry’s most promising – and, at one time, controversial – indie studios.\nRed Candle Games began in 2014 when designer Coffee Yao was developing a prototype for Detention.

The 2008 Prince of Persia reboot didn’t reignite the series as Ubisoft had hoped, and 2010’s Forgotten Sands felt closer to a movie tie-in than a new, proper entry.\nThat game’s subtitle would end up being a portend of the future as the series seemed inexplicably lost to time.

Unsurprisingly, then, video games also tell stories of migration.

Developers that ushered in the “golden age” of arcades and the first two generations of home consoles began to crash and burn at an alarming pace. In no time, the once billion-dollar industry was reduced to rubble.\nIn the summer of that same year, in Japan, gaming giant Nintendo released its first-ever home console with swappable cartridges.

Today, six years later, Microsoft owns more than 50 studios, thanks to various acquisitions over the years.\nMicrosoft announced in January of 2022 that it was acquiring Call of Duty and Diablo maker Activision Blizzard for a colossal $68.7 billion, the largest video game acquisition ever. After nearly two years of Stateside court cases with the federal government, appeals and appeasements across the pond, unprecedented document leaks, direct arguments from rivals like PlayStation, and more, the deal is complete: Xbox is home to all 19 of Activision Blizzard’s studios (and King’s 11 mobile game development st…",

Trends inspire entire genres to be prevalent, and we also have events like 2009, where there were two high-profile open-world games about super-powered humans: Infamous and Prototype.

While he thought it dragged on a bit in the second half, our reviewer said, \"Calling Requiem a standard sequel is a disservice; Asobo has created a Plague Tale epic.\" You can read that full review here and take a look at the other two offerings below.\nThe other two games are Evil West and Nobody Saves the World, each also released in 2022. Evil West is a third-person shooter set in a world that's a fusion between a classic Wild West and gothic horror and one that reminded one of our editors of his time as a kid playing Darkwatch. Meanwhile, Nobody Saves the World is about a shapeshifting Nobody (yeah, that's his name) on a quest to find the wizard who can stop a fungal infection from overtaking the world. Written by John Carson, the Game Informer review reads, \"Despite its minor shortcomings, Nobody Saves the World kept me enthralled from start to finish.\"D All three games will be available to download on January 2.\nAnd as always, as the new comes in, the old must go; subscribers will have until January 1 to download the current crop of PS Plus games, which includes Lego 2K Drive, Powerwash Simulator, and Sable.\nAre you excited to check out any of January's PS Plus Games?

During his tenure, he worked on first-party behemoths like God of War, Horizon: Zero Dawn, and Detroit: Become Human. But today, heʼs talking about a different type of testing involving a headset and physically mimicking movements for multiple hours at your office desk.\nIn games like Blood & Truth, where you take a starring role in action movie-esque setpieces, the fun factor of virtual reality quickly makes itself apparent. However, experiences like this can be taxing. A player can stop at any time. A tester doesnʼt have that…",

The tuned-to-perfection turn-based combat, the beautiful soundtrack, the heartfelt story, and the eye-popping-for-the-time visuals created one of the most important entries of one of the most important franchises in video game history. However, one element was absent from Final Fantasy X that several of the key developers involved with the project lamented: an explorable world map.\nFor Yoshinori Kitase, a producer on Final Fantasy VII Rebirth who also served as a director on Final Fantasy VI, VII, VIII, and X, the world map's disappearance was a sore spot as someone who has been involved with the series since 1990. \"We started off expressi…",

This is on top of the toolset allowing anyone to make and publish their own games within Fortnite.\nThe whole thing was kind of weird.\nNot that any of the experiences are bad – the Lego thing is super not for me, but I really like the racing game (made by Psyonix, developer of Rocket League), and I think the music element has the potential to become something interesting down the road. \nI'm just not so sure Epic's utopian vision of Fortnite as this everything app makes sense.
