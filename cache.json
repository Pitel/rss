That might be enough to set you off on a certain existential crisis, true, but we can all take comfort in the fact that people are still discovering new things that the console is capable of. Take Pierre Dandumont for example, who has finally managed to answer the age-old question - could you get a Wii to run Mac OS? The answer is yes. Just about (thanks, Gizmodo).\nShared in a video on his YouTube channel, the tech wiz demonstrates not only that the Wii is capable of getting the Apple operating system up and running, but it can even open up some applications! Internet Explorer 5? No problems (bar the absence of an internet connection). iTunes? Light work (so long as you don't want to hear any music). A quick game of Doom? Easy peasy - actually running at one frame per minute, we can't say this is either 'quick' or a 'game', but the project is impressive nonetheless.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Putting the 'open' in 'open zone'.\nWe think it's fair to say that the huge dust cloud which followed Sonic Frontiers' launch has finally settled. Clocking in mixed reviews across the board, one topic that seemed to divide us all was the game's approach to the 'open zone' concept with some believing that it was a great leap forward for the Sonic franchise and others seeing it as not going far enough. It seems, however, that these zones were originally intended to be a lot more, well, open.\nOne fan has been poking about in the Switch's game files and has uncovered original beta islands which seem to combine the layout which would be later used in Frontiers' smaller zones. Posting their discoveries on the YouTube channel ĐeäTh, this tour around Sonic's original island presents a world which is far more open than that which we ended up receiving.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Yep, it's time for the annual update to Ubisoft's long-running franchise and, although it's tempting to simply cut-and-paste last year's review in here — these games really don't change much beyond the playlist from version to version — it turns out there's actually been a few meaningful changes made this time around.\nFirst things first, and the best bit of news for us personally, is that you can now turn off the constant notifications and adverts for the Just Dance+ subscription service. If you remember Just Dance 2022, this was one of the most frustrating aspects of last year's effort, with constant reminders that you didn't have all the content on offer, even though you'd just forked out fifty quid for the game (which, incidentally, isn't getting a physical release this year — beware of those codes-in-boxes!). It's great to see Ubisoft recognise that people probably don't want to be pushed to spend more cash every time they tune in for a quick bop or workout.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

For anyone who might not be aware of what's going on, the Xbox giant moved to acquire the publisher of Call of Duty, Overwatch, Crash Bandicoot, and other major IP for an astonishing $68.7 billion. Sony, meanwhile, isn't too happy about the deal, stating its ongoing concerns about potentially losing Call of Duty to its primary competitor. As such, the deal is currently under close scrutiny from several regulators, including the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).\nIn a recently published document, Sony Interactive Entertainment put across a series of observations to potentially assist in its efforts to block the deal between Microsoft and Activision Blizzard from going through, and one observation in particular caught our attention.

It's a medieval murder mystery with monks and manuscripts and other m things - including the protagonist, who is an artist called Andreas Maler. It's inspired by The Name Of The Rose, a murder mystery similarly focused on a medieval scriptorium in a monastary (and notable for being adapted into a film where Sean Connery is a detective monk aided by a tiny baby Christian Slater).\nIn the ol' days books, were copied by monks onto parchment made of animal skin. Most people weren't educated enough to read, in case poor people got radical ideas like maybe they should get some rights, and controlling the flow and spread of information was one of the things that made the church as powerful as it was. Pentiment takes place just as printing presses are becoming popular, which makes access to knowledge more readily available. Part of how the game conveys this is through the dialogue - not the stuff people are saying, although that helps, but what their speech bubbles looks like when they talk. You've probably already heard this, but I want to show you in a bit more detail.\nRead more",

Most folks seem to regard 2042 as a misstep compared to the triumph of Battlefield 1, but hey, Game Pass is a great way to check if they're right. You can't shoot railguns in the swedish wilderness back in WW1, can you now.\nRead more",

Suffice to say, chances to secure yourself such a graphics chip for £1200 are very rare indeed.

          "description": "I've known for a long time that becoming an astronaut was never going to be my life's calling. My eyesight's terrible, for one, and I guarantee I'd be vomming all over the walls if I was ever put inside one of those whirly burly machines to simulate the experience of launching into space. Indeed, if the two hours I spent playing Deliver Us Mars last week were anything to go by, I don't think I'd even make it through the doors at NASA. They'd take one look at me and turn me away on the spot, because man alive, even my fingers were aching after tackling a couple of different sections from early in the game's story.\nThere's a good reason for this, though, and it's one that actually enhanced my experience of the game as opposed to detracting from it. You see, while heroine Kathy might look like an auto-climbing Lara Croft-stronaut, with her pair of pickaxes dangling off her suit, in practice she's anything but. In fact, when she's climbing up and down walls, Kathy has more in common with Grow Home's little BUD bot than anyone else - albeit with a significantly higher polygon count. As she carries out her quest to look for tech to save Earth from an impending climate crisis, players manually control her climbing movements with pushes and squeezes of their right and left mouse buttons, plotting a course through the game's gnarled mess of girders and metallic bulkheads one axe stab at a time. It's a slow, but wonderfully tactile process, and it all adds up to launch Deliver Us Mars straight out of the trad, third-person action canon, and into the altogether starrier realms of platforming pioneers. \nRead more",

It was undoubtedly produced by AI to feed the social media machine, yet the cold, hard numbers transported me back to the warm embrace of Verdansk, a battle royale map my mates and escaped to almost every evening as the pandemic raged. The silly 120 second video shot me right in the feelings.\nMy history with the first game means that I enter Warzone 2 with an embarrassing tangle of emotional baggage and personal investment. It has a lot to live up to. And for the most part, it has been a joy to drop in again. Launch woes aside, the sequel iterates on the first in a way that feels like it'll last in the long run and confirms that there's still no battle royale that does it quite like Warzone.\nRead more",

Years later, Buddy is kidnapped by a militia group and Brad sets off to rescue her. When you put it like that, the story is pretty basic, but it’s so much more than it seems.

          "description": "When Nick Popovich was a kid, his parents ran the Sprague Road Tavern in North Royalton, Ohio. \"Everything was a dive bar,\" Popovich, now co-founder and CEO of Monomi Park, says of the drinking scene in the Cleveland suburb. \"It was all working-class, like dive-bar kinda thing. Which is basically what this place was.\" His mum and dad wanted to do up the joint, make it into something resembling what today would be called a sports bar. As part of this plan, Popovich's father added a game room to the building, filled with pool tables, shuffleboard (\"As a result I'm hugely into shuffleboard\", Popovich notes) and most importantly of all, a rotating stock of arcade machines.\nBack in the day, explains Popovich, the cabinet was the expensive thing. So his dad would find a cheap cabinet, they'd put in a cheap second-hand board and monitor, and paint the outside to make it look like the official version of the game. To the regulars drinking and shooting pool, it didn't matter that the arcade cabinet looked like a bootleg – that Donkey Kong was just a picture of a monkey that Popovich Senior had stencilled onto the side of the cabinet. What mattered was that the cabinet did what it needed to do, and that the game inside was legit. This line of thinking, of making something only as good as it needs to be, was an essential component in the development of Slime Rancher, Monomi Park's massively successful sci-fi farming simulator. \"The original Slime Rancher cheated. A very small group of people made it, and it looks like many more people than that made it,\" Popovich says.\nRead more",

Assuming that you do indeed find yourself constrained by your Deck’s own SSD, I’d suggest aiming for 512GB if you can – 256GB  will hold a fair few games but might also fill up fast if you’re installing a lot of gigabyte-hogging AAA games. Then again, an extra 256GB might be fine otherwise – many of the best Steam Deck games, like Vampire Survivors, have a tiny installation footprint. Your call.\r\n\n \nRead more",

What this 4K gaming monitor lacks in brand recognition, it makes up for in smooth performance, despite being absolutely dirt cheap – and you can pick one up for yourself, brand new, in the early Black Friday sales.\r\n\n\r\nThis is a UK-only deal, as I can’t find as the eiQ-32M4K144FS on sale at all from a US retailer. But I can’t stress enough what good value this monitor is for £380: that’s 1440p money, usually, but the eiQ-32M4K144FS is a full 3840x2160 display with a generous 32in of screen space. Between the 144Hz refresh rate and AMD FreeSync/Nvidia G-Sync support, it’s also remarkably stacked for gaming features; I’ve seen for myself how well G-Sync, for instance, eliminates screen tearing on the IPS panel. \r\n\n \nRead more",

Gripping the man around the neck, Ezio holds him steady so that a nearby thief - hired at a fixed rate of 150 florins for an indefinite period of rooftop troublemaking - can take a free swing at his exposed abdomen. The sword connects, though not with its intended target. Instead it catches Ezio in the shoulder, knocking the assassin off-balance. He teeters backward across the tiles and over the lip of the building, falling three floors into the packed street below. The farce of it all is worth every one of the twelve hitpoints he loses in the process.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The courses are oversized and fantastical, and because everyone’s balls are in play at the same time, you get all the light-hearted competition of a real putting contest without waiting for the person in front to take their turn.

The invisibility glitch had attention drawn to it over the weekend, when streamer SuperEv shared a video of being taken out by another player who didn’t seem to be there. The Warzone 2.0 Trello board listing known issues with the game doesn’t show any mention of known invisibility bugs yet, so stay frosty.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Games mostly don't do it justice at all, either making \"piracy\" shorthand for \"mindless omnicide for no reason\" or slapping a parroty theme onto a generic action game.\nBuccaneers! isn't primarily a piracy game, but they're one of its four factions. It doesn’t try to be more than a naval combat and light action RPG either, let alone the “real” pirate game I dearly want, but I can’t hold that against it either.  If I was being reductive, I'd call it a budget hybrid of Sea Of Thieves and Sid Meier's Pirates By Sid Meier Aged 33 And 3/4. It's probably unfair to set such high expectations, but the core design is compelling and enjoyable enough to merit it.\nRead more",

I'm saying this to emphasise that I loathe singiing the praises of anything even tangentially related to Marvel, without also revealing that I have stashed a steel chair and bag of thumbtacks under the ring as a surprise attack against Kevin Feige.\nSpider-Man is about as Marvel-related as you can get. I said back when the remaster of Insomniac's first Spider-Man game came to PC that the reason to not buy it was that Miles Morales was coming to PC in a few months. A few months has become now. And I must own that Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales is a good game. It's a big, bold action adventure full of heroics and quips, and it's still the better Spider-Man game. I think a large part of that is because it's shorter.\nRead more",

          "description": "Hot on the heels of their Solium Infernum announcement at the end of September, the studio behind strategy RPG Armello have announced another new game they're working on during tonight's PC Gaming Show Preview stream. It's called Jumplight Odyssey (or \"J-Lo\" for short, as League Of Geeks studio director and co-founder Trent Kusters affectionately referred to it during an early preview presentation I attended last week), and it's a starship roguelite colony sim that has big 70s anime vibes. Specifically, Star Blazers, the English adaptation of Leiji Matsumoto's seminal Space Battleship Yamato, with which Jumplight shares a lot of its core visual DNA. \nIn it, you play as Princess Euphora, who's on a mission to save her people from the space conquering Zutopans, jumping from planet to planet in search of their Forever Star. It's not due to arrive in early access until sometime next year, but I've seen a sneak peek of it running in an early alpha build, and lemme tell ya. FTL, Rimworld and Two Point Hospital likers (bear with me on that last one) are going to want to take note of this.\nRead more",

          "description": "Ever had a real-life experience where you’re something like 90% sure you’re actually in a horror film? Answers in the comments, please. Now, imagine that, but also someone asks you to pop your phone in a lockbox, you know, for safekeeping. Also, they say something like “You won’t need it where we’re going” and then do a murder wink at an imaginary camera. Something quite similar to this happens to our ill-fated documentary crew early in The Devil In Me. 'Aha!' I thought. Supermassive are being knowingly, playfully tropey again. Great. These games are best when they lean into the cheese like a drunk buffet guest, and I was pumped to watch it stumble around a schlocky murder party and get baked brie all over the elbows of its best tux.\nFor those yet to stick their snout into Supermassive’s truffle-trove of horror offerings, the basic premise of these narrative adventure games can best be summarised: What if shouting at the screen to try and stop idiot characters performing horror film no-nos actually worked? The formula was both invented and, miraculously, perfected in 2015’s Until Dawn. Since then, the studio have released three ‘episodic’ (although narratively independent) Dark Pictures titles, and The Quarry, all of which can best be summarised: Like Until Dawn, but not as good.\nRead more",

As winter turns to spring, the taekwondo master and bringer of JUSTICE, Kim Kaphwan, will make his eagerly awaited return to the ring. Evildoers beware.\nIn addition, spring will see SNK launch an open beta test for its new crossplay functionality, allowing fighters to test their mettle across PlayStation, Xbox, Steam, and Epic Games Store platforms. Across the remainder of the year, fans can expect more characters and balance patches. This will hopefully keep fan fervor up for what has been a successful first year for The King of Fighters — easily the most relevant that a KoF title has been on the global FGC stage in many years.\nThe King of Fighters XV is available now on PlayStation, Xbox Series X, and PC platforms.\nThe post The King of Fighters XV season 2 kicks off January 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Cult fighter to receive major upgrade\nSNK's fab and precise fighting title Samurai Shodown is currently preparing to make a comeback, bolstered by the power of some slick new rollback netcode. The developer announced that it will hold an open beta in January 2023 to test the sword-slashing title's new functionality.\nThe beta test will be held on the Steam edition of Samurai Shodown. It will offer SNK the opportunity to fine-tune the stability of the fighter's online mechanics ahead of the official rollback rollout, currently scheduled for spring 2023. Rollback netcode will be applied to the PlayStation, PC, and Xbox ports of Samurai Shodown, though the Nintendo Switch and (inevitably) Stadia releases will be missing out.\nThe arrival of rollback netcode, albeit three years late, will be very welcome to SamSho's devoted community. The 2019 reboot is unique among its fighting brethren, both in its visual design and its playstyle, and as such it deserves a new lease of life. Here's hoping that the update will help bring back some of those wandering ronins to a game that, frankly, deserves a better reputation within the fighting game community.\nSamurai Shodown is available now on PS4, PC, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.\nhttps://twitter.com/SNKPofficial/status/1595598325608218624?s=20&t=CtCKGc1TIrQFcSci7H8IWw\nThe post Samurai Shodown rollback beta coming to Steam January 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

A new Dead Island 2 showcase is scheduled for Tuesday, December 6.\nThe stream will kick off at 1 p.m. PT / 4 p.m. ET, with the Dead Island 2 showcase airing on the Dead Island YouTube channel. You can find that link here.\nhttps://twitter.com/deadislandgame/status/1595462356230115329\nWhat's the team planning to showcase? Well, so far we just have a description of \"action, gore, and zombies.\" Hopefully we get to see some details of what's in store for the long-in-development sequel to Dead Island.\nRising from the grave\nIt's at least another sign of life from the Dead Island 2 project, which has been in the works for quite a long time at this point. We did get confirmation of a release date and details at Gamescom earlier this year, but publisher Deep Silver confirmed last week that it's been pushed from February out to April 28, 2023.\n“The irony of delaying Dead Island 2 is not lost on us, and we are as disappointed as you undoubtedly are,” reads a statement from Deep Silver on the delay. “The delay is just 12 short weeks and development is on the final straight now; we’re going to take the time we need to make sure we can launch a game we’re proud to launch. For those of you who’ve been waiting for years, thank you for hanging in there with us.”\nMore delays tacked onto Dead Island 2 is one thing. But players also probably want to know what the game looks like after so many years. The zombie-smashing, weapon-crafting action of Dead Island could be pretty fun to play again. It's just a matter of getting it onto platforms and out of the lab.\nWe'll see if the showcase delivers on December 6.\nThe post A Dead Island 2 showcase is set for December 6 appeared first on Destructoid.",

And it sounds like Sony Santa Monica Studio is letting the latest Kratos and Atreus adventure stand alone for now, as God of War Ragnarok DLC seems unlikely.\nIn a spoilercast about God of War Ragnarok over at Kinda Funny Games (thanks for the spot, Eurogamer), director Eric Williams guested to discuss his game. At one point, he's asked about whether DLC is on the way for God of War Ragnarok.\n\"I don't know man, that game is big,\" said Williams. \"I think we put everything we had into it, so I wouldn't count on it.\"\nWhile there are updates in store for God of War Ragnarok, adding features like the photo mode, the stance on significant additions isn't too surprising. God of War (2018) didn't receive any extra DLC.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfJ4Km46A-0\nPatience, boy\nI haven't rolled credits on Ragnarok yet myself, but my understanding is that it's a fairly conclusive story. The sequel is the conclusion to the Norse duology that Sony Santa Monica Studio has created, so I'd be surprised to see any lingering threads addressed in a DLC update.\nRagnarok is doing well in sales and reception too. And apparently Santa Monica Studio has other things on their plate to take care of, moving forward.\nWhat could those projects be?

The Chinese holding company acquired a minority stake in the new developer, which was founded earlier this year by former members of The Witcher studio CD Projekt RED.\n\"We’re delighted to welcome NetEase Games as our new shareholder and partner,” said Rebel Wolves CEO Konrad Tomaszkiewicz in a press statement. \"Having one of the leading global game companies get behind our vision is a great confidence boost and validation for the entire team at Rebel Wolves. Funding provided by NetEase was the last missing piece needed to go full throttle. With resources available to build a world-class AAA game, we can now focus on what matters most: development.\"\nThis \"world-class AAA game\" is the first project undertaken by the new studio and, in keeping with its team's strengths, is expected to be a dark, open-world RPG with an emphasis on character relationships and far-reaching player consequences. There is currently no solid information on the title's release date or platforms but, given the pedigree of CDPR, we can likely expect a pretty long wait ahead.\nNetEase Games continues to spread its reach across global gaming development. While the studio had something of a falling out with Activision Blizzard this month, it also opened its first U.S.-based studio this year, Jackalope Games in Austin, Texas. NetEase also has minority and majority shares in partnerships with Quantic Dream, Grasshopper Manufacture, and Nagoshi Studio, led by Yakuza creator Toshihiro Nagoshi.\nDespite the NetEase investment, Rebel Wolves will remain independently operated, maintaining full creative control over its projects as well as full ownership of its IPs and brands.\nThe post NetEase Games acquires minority stake in Polish studio Rebel Wolves appeared first on Destructoid.",

Though Planet Entertainment stated that this wasn't the case, Cooking Mama IP owner Office Create filed suit against the publisher, stating that the company's right to use the Cooking Mama brand had expired — the initial build of the comical cook sim having been submitted and rejected back in 2018.\n\"Unfortunately, the quality of the game builds failed to meet the standards that our customers expect and deserve,\" said Office Create at the time. \"Office Create rejected a wide range of deficiencies affecting the overall feel, quality, and content of the game.\n\"Yet, despite being contractually obligated to correct the identified deficiencies and resubmit the corrected game for Office Create's approval, Planet proceeded to release Cooking Mama: Cookstar without addressing all of the rejections and without Office Create's approval.\"\nFollowing this week's legal ruling, Cooking Mama: Cookstar has been removed from the PSN Store and the Nintendo eShop, and all remaining physical copies must be removed from store shelves.

However, in a shocking turn of events, the studio's closure was announced mere weeks later.\nThe post Square Enix Montreal to shut down four mobile releases appeared first on Destructoid.",

That's a meaty feat.\nGod of War Ragnarok is available now on PlayStation platforms.  And it seems folks are into it.\nhttps://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1595432230750674945?s=20&t=qSazuZ38JJ6L0vCuhO6bzg\nThe post God of War Ragnarok had the fastest selling first-party launch in PlayStation history appeared first on Destructoid.",

Yep, it's none other than Nuka-World, complete with a season map that depicts the theme park before the post-apocalyptic setting of the series.\nLike past seasons (wow, has there really been 11 at this point?), Nuka-World will offer \"cosmetics, CAMP items, atoms, caps, and more\" as you progress through the track. There's a short trailer you can watch below that shows off the season offerings/rewards, as well as some of the expansion itself.\nAs a reminder, the ammo box is also coming, but only if you pay up for the game's subscription service: \"Active Fallout 1st members can also unlock exclusive rewards and special S.C.O.R.E. boosts throughout the Season, but there’s more! This update also grants an all-new feature for Fallout 1st members at no additional charge: the Ammo Box! Keep unlimited numbers of your bullets, shells and such in safekeeping, like the existing Scrap Box currently available to Fallout 1st members. Note that the Ammo Box is for stackable ammo types only and won’t store Fusion Cores or Plasma Cores.\"\nIn addition to a few other \"holiday games,\" I'm thinking I might hunker down and play through this expansion when things get slower in mid-December: the game is in a decent place to recruit friends into, especially with Game Pass.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfLWJ30kIvs\nThe post Fallout 76’s Nuka-World expansion theme will be incorporated in the season pass appeared first on Destructoid.",

The Toy Story realm joins Disney Dreamlight Valley on December 6, 2022.\nThe new update will arrive on all platforms on December 6, adding the new realm and Toy Story leads Woody and Buzz to the game. Plus, there are some Toy Story cosmetics in store for Disney Dreamlight Valley players to collect.\nWe got a good look at what's in store for the new area in a recent trailer. It highlights what's in store for intrepid Dreamlight Valley players who wander into Andy's Room.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lStz8KPOHl8\nBuzz Lightyear definitely looks like Buzz Lightyear, but Woody has some wild energy to him. The animations are really moving, in a way that makes me think this cowboy will definitely jump-scare at least one player on a stream.\nThat said, I've really enjoyed the way Disney Dreamlight Valley reimagines some popular Disney characters. Mickey's entire storyline of being a sad wife guy and seeing ghosts around town was a spin I did not expect, and made me like the character a lot more than just a normal Mickey storyline would have.\nVenture into the valley\nDisney Dreamlight Valley launched into an early access version this year, and it seems to have had a warm reception. It's a little bit of Animal Crossing meets famous Disney characters, but the appeal makes a ton of sense. Slowly building up a town full of Disney mainstays and seeing them interact, as well as completing some chill quests for them, is an interesting premise that seems to have worked out.\nWe'll see what kind of energy Buzz and Woody bring to the neighborhood when they arrive in the valley on December 6.\nThe post Disney Dreamlight Valley gets its Toy Story realm in December appeared first on Destructoid.",

The compendium features a small handful of shmups that jetted out of developer Telenet Japan in the early '90s, finding an audience on Sega Mega Drive and PC Engine.\nThe new collection is the spearhead of a project by Edia to archive the works of Telenet Japan, a developer/publisher that produced a huge library of games for the console era's formative years. From arcade adventures to platformers, beat-'em-ups to shmups, Telenet Japan would develop and/or publish titles for a wide variety of platforms including Sega Mega Drive, MSX, PC Engine, Game Boy, and the Sharp X68000.\n\nThe Telenet Shooting Collection will feature four titles in total: Sega Mega Drive releases Granada (1990) and Gaiares (1990), and PC Engine titles Avenger (1990) and Psychic Storm (1992). No details have been released in regards to any new modes or additional content, nor has a western localization been announced. The collection is set to launch in Japan on Nintendo Switch in the latter half of 2023.\nAdditionally, Edia has launched a crowdfunding campaign on Makuake to help fund the development and marketing of the title. With an achievable goal of around three million yen (around $22,000 USD), Edia hopes that the money can be put toward additional features, as well as marketing materials for the title's official release. With the archiving of gaming's earliest eras now more important than ever, this project is increasingly important and could bring some long M.I.A. releases to new audiences.\nIn related news, Cosmic Fantasy Collection will launch in Japan, December 15, on Nintendo Switch.\nThe post Telenet Shooting Collection compiles some forgotten ’90s shmups appeared first on Destructoid.",

There's truly nothing better than a choreographed song that just yells out the moves to you, because even someone with two left feet can make that work. The song is truly a staple of organized events, but thanks to a Call of Duty streamer with a sense of humor, the \"Cha Cha Slide\" has made its way into Warzone 2.0 in the most wholesome, hilarious way.\nI had almost completely forgotten the \"Cha Cha Slide\" even existed until I saw a video of @JhbTeam playing the song over his microphone in the Warzone proximity chat. As any reasonable person would do, a crowd of enemy players formed in front of him to participate in the greatest line dance known to man. It's surprising how well the \"Cha Cha Slide\" translates to Call of Duty, although I am a bit disappointed no one actually slid when the song instructs them to slide.\nhttps://twitter.com/JhbTeam/status/1594785851242090496\nAccording to JhbTeam, it took them a bunch of tries to get enemy players to stop shooting long enough to get in on the joke. I can absolutely say that whether or not someone is willing to do the \"Cha Cha Slide\" in Warzone is a litmus test for whether or not they would be my friend. All of these players passed the vibe check. You can even see that JhbTeam is receiving friend requests from the other players while conducting the group in the classic dance, so here's hoping that this will be the start of some beautiful friendships.\nAs much as I love CoD, I sometimes find that the series, and some of the people who play it, take themselves a bit too seriously sometimes. Seeing something like this is a great reminder that we're all out here to have fun, and getting a win is often less important than getting into the spirit of the game and sharing in a cool moment with others.\nThe post This Warzone player used proximity chat to do the “Cha Cha Slide” appeared first on Destructoid.",

The new trailer focuses on the strategic gameplay of the RPG sequel — specifically the magical mechanic known as \"Emblem Rings\".\nThe Emblem Ring mechanic allows the protagonist to infuse their skills and abilities with the spirit of other Fire Emblem heroes, whose powers are harnessed within literal rings. Once activated, the Emblem Ring expands upon, boosts, or otherwise enhances certain abilities, as the protagonist takes on the skills and combat arts of their chosen Emblem Ring. In a fashion, it is similar to the Persona mechanic in the series of the same name — except instead of Pixie or Nekomata, you have Celica or Byleth.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIWPFmnu4Vk\nAs they grow alongside their chosen Fire Emblem rings, the protagonist will inherit weapons, skills, and spells from this roster of classic characters, while building up overdrive abilities and all-new ultimate attacks, defined by the classic characters you have chosen to grow alongside. Six rings are featured in this trailer (Sigurd, Celica, Corrin, Lyn, Byleth, and, of course, Marth.

On December 6, the \"Nuka-World on Tour\" expansion is set to drop,\nBethesda and the powers that be are still pushing the \"Fallout 1st\" subscription, and it'll apparently offer a new feature called the \"ammo storage box.\" Yep, it's exactly how it sounds, as the team is offering \"unlimited space to store all your excess munitions [with the exception of Plasma Cores and Fusion Cores.\" It's fascinating to see premium elements that impact direct gameplay creep in over time, and how the community responds to it.\nWhether you're thinking about jumping back in or you're excited for the update: there's some gameplay and developer commentary you can watch below. One of the best parts of the episode is actually near the start, where Carl McKevitt, senior quest designer, talks about how they carved out an existing area to make room for the actual \"tour\" in the Nuka-World on Tour location.\nWe don't really have a clear view of many things coming after this, so we'll see what 2023 brings. Next up, the team promises an update on December 1 with more info on Nuka-World on Tour.\nFallout 76 – Nuka-World on Tour (Developer Gameplay)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTPRMyrXAbM\nThe post The Fallout 76 team gave us a glimpse at the next big update: Nuka-World appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The return of virtual college football is still a ways away\nElectronic Arts' return to college football is still a ways off. EA Sports confirms it's aiming for a summer 2024 revival of its college football series.\nSpeaking to ESPN, EA Sports VP and general manager Daryl Holt said the timing is due to how much of an undertaking this will be.\n\"That's the best date for us to bring the game that we think is going to meet or exceed our player expectations,\" Holt told ESPN. \"And cover the breadth and scale of what we want in the game. We're trying to build a very immersive college football experience.\"\nPart of this involves use real college football players in the game. Before, using players' likeness in a new EA Sports college football seemed like a non-starter. But as Holt describes it, \"the road's open now, but it's still under construction.\"\nThis echoes some comments from July 2021 about the possibility of using real players in the virtual experience. An EA source told ESPN that players will be compensated if they appear in-game.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTklaI3EAm0\nBack to school\nEA first announced back in February of 2021 that college football would be returning to the EA Sports fold. Alongside today's window, EA also confirms that both Road to Glory and Dynasty modes will be in store for the new series.\nSince we've been without virtual college football since 2013, this news probably sparks some hope for fans of the sport. That being said, player likenesses and compensation still seem to be a lingering question mark. At the very least, a summer 2024 window gives Electronic Arts some time to figure it all out.\nThe post EA Sports’ college football revival is aiming for summer 2024 appeared first on Destructoid.",

The almost mythic puzzler will launch in the near future courtesy of, of all people, Hamster's Arcade Archives range.\nDeveloped by Arika, and originally released in Japanese arcades in 1998, Tetris: The Grand Master follows the typical ruleset of Alexey Pajitnov genre-defining classic, but offers up a staggering 999 levels of play and introduces the \"20G\" mechanic beloved by dedicated players. Essentially, this mechanic sees blocks appear directly on top of the wall, offering the player a split-second to effectively move them into place.\nCheck out the wild action in the classic run below, courtesy of YouTuber Sega-16.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEzvyMI4I9I\nTetris: The Grand Master is recognized by the Tetris community's expert players and speedrunners — those who you see performing almost reality-breaking feats of organization at events such as Awesome Games Done Quick, (or alternately, my friend Jonster, whose own Tetris skills leave me utterly flabbergasted. Look how happy he is in this tweet!). While TGM would receive several readily available sequels, this Arcade Archives release will represent the original's first-ever home release outside of Japan, and as such is a major reckoning for Tetris players.\nNo date has been revealed for the title's launch but, as regular readers will be aware, we cover each and every Arcade Archives release right here on Destructoid, and have done so for many, many years. Thus, we'll be sure to let you know when TGM is headed to a platform near you.

We asked the people behind the game's success to share how Sonic's second outing became one of Sega's driving forces in its fight against Nintendo.\nComing off of the massive success of the Japan-developed Sonic the Hedgehog, Sega relocated development efforts for the sequel to the newly founded Sega Technical Institute in the U.S. Sega tapped Mark Cerny to lead the STI, who has since gone on to help create other mascots like Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon.

The number, which includes physical and downloadable copies as reported by Nintendo, already places Pokémon Scarlet and Violet in the top 15 best-selling Nintendo Switch titles of all time. In this three-day number, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet have already outpaced lifetime sales of games such as Splatoon 3, Kirby and the Forgotten Land, Nintendo Switch Sports, and Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury.\nThe current overall best-selling Nintendo Switch title is Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, which has sold just over 48 million units as of the end of September. As of this writing, the Pokémon franchise occupies 3 of the top 10 slots of lifetime Nintendo Switch software sales, with Let's Go, Pikachu and Eevee at number 10, Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl at number 8, and Sword and Shield at number 5. Pokémon Scarlet and Violet need to sell just under 5 million more combined copies to crack into the top 10. To date, the Nintendo Switch has sold over 114 million units.\nPokémon Scarlet and Violet represent the first time players are able to explore a fully open-world environment in a mainline Pokémon RPG. While critics praised various aspects of the newest games in the series, the technical performance has been universally panned.

          "description": "A new Fire Emblem Engage trailer has detailed how players can summon \"Emblems,\" characters from past Fire Emblem games. Units will be able to equip Engage Rings to gain the ability to gain the power of a hero, like Marth or Byleth. When units equip the rings, they become synced with the Emblems, boosting their stats and giving them access to new, Emblem-specific skills. Based on the demonstration in the trailer, this will make a massive difference in a unit’s power level.\n\n\nUnits can also “Engage” with the Emblems, fusing into a new form even more powerful than a synced form. In addition to gaining access to special weapons, the player can use Engage Skills: unique abilities that harken back to the Emblems’ original games. For example, since Byleth was a teacher in Fire Emblem: Three Houses, one of his abilities allows him to teach nearby units, boosting their stats. Meanwhile, Corrin can use an ability called Dragon Vein, which alters the terrain in the same way she was able to in Fire Emblem Fates.\nIn total, the trailer showed off six Emblems: Marth (Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon), Sigurd (Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War), Celica (Fire Emblem Gaiden/Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia), Lyn (Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade), Corrin (Fire Emblem Fates), and Byleth (Fire Emblem: Three Houses). Additionally, a trailer from last week features glimpses of Ike and Lucina, and then mentions 12 rings, implying that Engage will feature more Emblems at launch.\nFire Emblem Engage was announced at a Nintendo Direct back in September. The initial trailer revealed that Alear, the game’s protagonist, is the Divine Dragon, a descendant of a royal family of Dragons that defeated the Fell Dragon many years ago. We’ll know the full story and more when the game launches on January 20, 2023.",

          "description": "Legendary Sonic designer and Balan Wonderworld director Yuji Naka has been arrested in Tokyo in connection to an insider trading investigation involving the reveal of a Dragon Quest game. \nAccording to the Japanese news outlet FNN, the last 24 hours saw ex-Square Enix employee Taisuke Sazaki and his friend Fumiaki Suzuki arrested on suspicion for insider trading. In 2020, developer Aiming had been set to announce its mobile game Dragon Quest Tact, and Sazaki and Suzuki are alleged to have known details about the game before it was publicly revealed. The pair reportedly purchased a combined 162,000 shares of Aiming for roughly 47.2 million yen (or over $335,000) in advance with the intent of profiting on a potentially higher stock price stemming from Tact’s announcement. \nYuji Naka is now suspected of being involved in this scandal as well. He is accused of purchasing 10,000 shares worth 2.8 million yen (roughly $20,000) in Aiming for the same purpose of profiting from Tact’s reveal. Naka was apprehended by Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office, and the investigation is ongoing. It’s currently unknown if the suspects still own their shares or if they already sold them.  \nThis is the second major controversy Naka has found himself involved with this year. In April, Naka publicly blasted Square Enix on Twitter over his removal as director from Balan Wonderworld prior to its release, blaming Square for the game’s critical failure. This outburst came after the conclusion of a lawsuit he’d previously filed against the publisher. Naka is best known as the lead programmer behind the original Sonic the Hedgehog games for Sega Genesis and Nights into Dreams. \n[Source: FNN]",

The video revealed some details on the project’s status as well as some early images. \n\n\nThe Splinter Cell remake was first announced last December, but we’ve known very little about it other than it’s being rebuilt from scratch in Snowdrop Engine (used to make The Division, Mario + Rabbids games). In the video, the team states the experience will be identical to the 2002 title but it wants to implement improvements and features introduced in later Splinter Cell titles as well as smooth some rough edges. For example, the team wants to give players more opportunities to de-escalate situations when things go awry instead of getting an instant Game Over. \nThe dev team also shares that the project is still in the early prototyping phase. As such, the studio will be going dark “for a while” to focus on making the game, so it will likely be a good while before we hear anything substantial about the remake again. In the meantime, you can take a look at the gallery of new concept images shared during the presentation below. \n\nSplinter Cell doesn’t have a release window or announced platforms. This remake is only one of many on the horizon, and you can keep up with all of them by checking our big list of upcoming video game remakes.",

And now, due to Saints Row failing to meet the full expectations of Embracer Group, developer Volition will become part of Gearbox Entertainment. \nThis news comes by way of Video Games Chronicle, which reports that Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors discussed this transition in a statement released alongside the company's second-quarter earning results. \n\n\n\"The reception of Saints Row did not meet the full expectations and left the fanbase partially polarized,\" Wingefores said in the statement. \"The game development studio, Volition, has been working hard to improve the player experience. Financially, Saints Row has performed in line with management expectations in the quarter. Going forward, Volition will transition to become part of Gearbox which has all the tools, including an experienced management team in the US, to create future success at Volition.\"\nWingefors notes that this is the first time the company has performed an \"internal group transfer where we transfer a major studio between operative groups,\" but says that \"it is not necessarily the last.\" \nSaints Row currently sits at 61 on Metacritic (for the PlayStation 5 version), with a user score of 2.1. Game Informer gave the game an 8.5 out of 10 in its review and you can read what we liked about Saints Row here. \n[Source: Video Games Chronicle]\nDid you play Saints Row?

This news was revealed through a title card teased at the end of the Fortnite Champion Series, which took place over the weekend, as reported by Eurogamer. You can see the title card at the top of this story, if you're curious. \nUnfortunately, that's all that Epic Games teased in terms of the end of Fortnite's Fracture era. As for what's in store for Chapter 4 or what this finale event might play like, that remains unknown. Fortunately, we don't have to wait too much longer, though, because the event begins in just a few weeks. \nIf it's anything like previous Fortnite chapter finales, then expect huge PvE battles across the island, plenty of spectacle, an exciting conclusion, and of course, some downtime as the game prepares to launch the next chapter. \n[Source: Eurogamer]\nAre you tuning into the finale event for Fortnite Chapter 3?

Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. You can also catch up on previous episodes by visiting our new Game Informer Shows YouTube channel or watching the embedded episode below. \nMetal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. \n\n\nJoin me, Marcus Stewart, and Blake Hester as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure.

The news also provided insight into the sequel's development status. \nAccording to a press release, Control 2 (once known as Codename Heron) is currently in the concept phase, being built in Remedy’s proprietary Northlight engine. The game will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Remedy will publish the PC version while 505 will handle the game’s console releases. Control 2 has no release window, but Remedy did release a piece of concept art, posted below. \nThe press release also states that Control 2’s development budget initially sat at 50 million euros. Remedy and 505 will equally split marketing and development costs, as well as revenue generated by its release. Remedy retains full ownership of the Control IP, however. The press release also reveals that the first Control has sold over 3 million copies since launching in 2019. \n“We are excited to deepen our cooperation with Remedy and continue the success story of Control together,” say Rami and Raffi Galante, co-CEOs of Digital Bros Group/505 Games. “... Control is the biggest investment 505 Games has ever made, so it has a special place in our hearts. We are grateful to the whole player community that has made Control such a long-lasting and loved game, and are even more excited to bring out Control 2.”\nThis announcement was first teased last June, when Remedy and 505 revealed plans for new triple-A Control experiences. That same update revealed an upcoming multiplayer spin-off title known as Project Condor. Earlier this year, Remedy also struck a deal with Rockstar to develop remakes of Max Payne 1 and 2.",
