Now, at a recent lecture hosted by Japan’s Association of Copyright for Computer Software, Nintendo lawyer Koji Nishiura has explained the technicalities of when an emulator is considered illegal and why the Big N has so many in the crosshairs.\nAs reported by Denfaminicogamer, Nishiura — the deputy general manager of Nintendo's IP division and patent attorney — explained that there's a difference in legality between the emulator itself and its uses: \"While you can’t immediately claim that an emulator is illegal in itself, it can become illegal depending on how it’s used\" (translated by Automaton).\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Slice to kill.\nThe problem with the term ‘Metroidvania’ is that it’s a far broader genre classification than some give it credit for. Depending on where they fall on the spectrum between the exploration-heavy Metroid series and the combat-centric Castlevania series, it’s possible for two games to both be considered Metroidvanias while playing, looking, and sounding nothing alike. Neither extreme is more valid than the other. What’s important is understanding which portions of the genre a given title is committed to, and whether it’s successful.\nIt’s not enough to simply call Blade Chimera a great Metroidvania and leave it at that. What Team Ladybug (Record of Lodoss War: Deedlit in Wonder Labyrinth, Drainus) has cooked up here is a game that is impressively clear-eyed in identifying its priorities — which just so happen to mirror many of the tenets of Konami’s legendary vampire hunting series — and executing on them to incredible effect. It doesn’t do everything one might expect a Metroidvania to do, but its particular bright spots are blinding to behold.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "That's what you get for not hailing to the chimp.\nIt’s not unfair to say that the gaming landscape was somewhat different when Donkey Kong Country Returns first fell into our laps in 2010; 2D platformers were a rare breed, and ol’ DK himself hadn’t arguably had a mainline entry in his series since 2004’s Jungle Beat. Back then, the title said it all: not only was Donkey Kong back, but Donkey Kong Country had indeed returned. That’s not quite the world we’re living in 15 years later.\nHaving said that, just like the original, Donkey Kong Country Returns HD explains everything you need to know about it in the title: it’s Donkey Kong Country Returns in HD, and unfortunately, it’s not much more than that. This is that same great game from the Wii era tarted up a bit here and there.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

But it was very messy because it was my first game and I didn't know what the hell I was doing. So I found myself, when it came to pumping content out, I was like: oh, shit. This code base is fucking awful. Like, I can't put stuff together easily. I'm running into bugs everywhere. But now shit just works!\"\nYou might know Sam Prebble as Trigger Happy Interactive, the solo developer behind frenetic FPS Turbo Overkill. Before that he went by a different name, attached to a very different project. Total Chaos, first released in 2018 under the moniker Wadaholic, is a total conversion mod for Doom 2. With its focus on a thick survival horror atmosphere of tension and disempowerment, it's about as far removed from Turbo Overkill's manic, Doom Eternal-inspired action as a game can get. As Prebble puts it, the only thing the two projects have in common is the first person perspective. Even so, he found himself returning to Total Chaos after wrapping development on Turbo Overkill, resulting in the standalone remake. \nRead more",

          "description": "Like it or not, horror gaming is often built on jump scares. Deriding a good cheap scare ignores the endorphin rush that draws so many players to the genre, in the same way that the \"elevated horror\" trend forfeits some of the soul of schlocky slasher flicks and ghost movies. Don’t get me wrong, Silent Hill and Alan Wake deserve their flowers - but even those games would wither on the screen if Pyramid Head didn’t bust through a wall from time to time.\nOne unsung jump scare game in particular pioneered horror in the internet age, blazing everywhere from nascent social media to major television networks. In fact, if you had an internet connection circa 2005, there’s a good chance you played it. Alas, it was too ahead of its time, too successful at leveraging virality before viral horror was sought after. Next time you see a streamer throw their headphones across the room in fright, beware: the spirit of Scary Maze Game is right behind you.\nRead more",

I’m happy to discover this explanation, because at first I thought that “spance” was just a litigation-avoiding, supermarket rebrand of “space”. I was bracing to send the good news to developers Skyglow Softworks that, so far, nobody has managed to copyright “space”, though I’m sure somebody’s tried. Maybe, um, God? \r\n\n\r\nIt’s a relief to know that God won’t be suing Skyglow Softworks for breach of copyright, because off the back of two demo missions, Annihilate The Spance is worryingly compelling. It’s a mixture of space RTS and autobattler, wherein you construct bases that produce spanceships who autopilot towards the nearest and largest concentration of enemies. According to the developers, it’s inspired by the 2011 Flash game Obliterate Everything by CWWallis (RIP), which I dimly recall playing while I was running a browser game blog for AOL.

The slate wiped clean, what if you got to be mates with everyone from all sides in this grand ensemble tale of warring states? A battle might take eight minutes. The three consecutive bonding cutscenes before the next might take ten. Origins is just as much about fighting thousands at a time as it is about eating lunch with Zhang Fei or discussing the meaning of heroism with Zhou Yu. There's a parallel story about your character and his role in a magical order of destiny godlings I didn't find the least bit interesting, but the rest is thrilling because Romance is already thrilling.

Coming soon to press that advantage are the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 9 9900X3D, a pair of even higher-spec processors that headlined AMD’s plethora of CES 2025 hardware announcements.\nNo pricing (or exact release date) on these yet, but they both up the core and thread counts over the 9800X3D while peaking at higher boost clock speeds. And, of course, they share the same 3D V-Cache design that makes the 9800X3D such a superlative CPU in the first place. If you don’t know what this is and how it helps game performance, imagine how much faster you could eat Wotsits if you had a massive bucket of them on your desk at all times, instead of having to get up and walk to the kitchen to grab individual packs. In this case the Wotsits are data, the bucket is 3D V-Cache, and the hastened ruination of your digestive system is games running faster.\nRead more",

Yet that's the challenge taken up yesterday by speedrunners at Awesome Games Done Quick. The UFO 50 speedrun includes an impressive dart through the retro collection's most bewildering game, the ancient and mysterious Barbuta, in which your character is a frustratingly slow hero with a fearfully short attack range. They managed to complete it in less than five minutes. Not only does the run (and its helpful commentary) serve as a short and sweet explanation of why Barbuta is so glitchily fascinating, it also left plenty of time to marathon another three games from the collection. \nRead more",

One was a cheesy round-up of the best manboobs in video games for Green Man Gaming's long-vanished blog. It was published sometime in 2010, and IIRC, pre-reboot Kratos came out on top. I think/hope it still exists somewhere in the apparatus of Green Man Gaming, hidden beneath the retailer's veneer of respectability like a barrel of radioactive waste. The other boob article was a piece for OXM about Ken Levine saying that he wished people would stop fixating on Elizabeth's cleavage in Bioshock Infinite - a complaint we might consider slightly hypocritical, given the character's visual design.\nNow it's time for boob article number 3: some modder has given 122 of the 150 Jokers in cardgame Balatro big chests. This extends from visibly human Jokers to Joker concepts that shouldn't, strictly speaking, have the capacity for boobage. The banana card has boobs, for example. The credit card card has boobs.

Paradise is marketed as a third-person game set in a sunny modern city, where you can speak to any NPC via microphone on the street and get stilted responses powered by artificial intelligence. You will supposedly drive sports cars, shoot guns at people, and accrue in-game cash. But its more outlandish claims attracted immediate scrutiny from video creators who found countless inconsistencies in the marketing material. The game has since been removed from the Epic Games Store, presumably for breaking many of the store's rules. But it's still on Steam, and somehow clambering steadily up the wishlist ladder in defiance of its many red flags.\nRead more",

          "description": "How would a younger me react to the concept of game seasons? \"Leave me alone, please. I’m busy replaying The Suffering 2 for the sixth time to see a new 15 second cutscene that recognises which combination of morally aligned beginnings and endings I’ve picked. It reads your save from the first game and everything!\". Say ‘memory card’ to a youthful, broccoli-maned Fortnite enjoyer nowadays. Go on, I dare you. You’ll be in a home before you know it.\nStill, having new toys at regular intervals is one real upshot of our new live-service barrage of ephemeral novelty, perpetually flung at my dizzy eyeballs like gleaming carnival daggers at exhausted spinning wheels. Especially if they’re for the exquisite strategy of Mechabellum. Season 2 released yesterday alongside patch 1.2, bringing with it a new unit and specialist, some reworks, and lots of cosmetic bits I pretend not to care about but then get excited when I unlock a new one.\nRead more",

The concept for Judas is that you're trapped in a computer-run society housed aboard a colony ship, the Mayflower. The titular Judas has managed to break free of the AI-groomed status quo, and is out to start a revolution. \"Bioshock Infinite in space\", we called it, back in 2022, but Levine says it's more open-ended than either of his Bioshock endeavours, with a greater emphasis on other characters remembering and responding to your actions over time.\n Read more",

          "description": "I think the last time I read an actual, original Garfield comic was in 1998. Since then, my experience of the character has been one long litany of Gar-memes and in particular, Gorefield memes. For those blissfully unaware, Gorefield is a version of Jim Davis’s otiose, lasagna-loving housecat who has broken his comic strip shackles and become a cosmic abomination. Gorefield's manifestations are many: centipede Gorefields, arachnid Gorefields, Gorefields that extend serpentine necks of unfleshed bone towards a cowering Jon Arbuckle, demanding to be fed in a voice that sounds nothing like Bill Murray, a voice as deep and velvety as the eternal Monday before the Big Bang.\nIn Gar-Type, a free Gorefield fangame from Youtuber and pixel artist LumpyTouch, Garfield has become a planet. The good news is that, unlike many other Gore-variants, this Gorefield is vulnerable to bullets. It falls to ace pilot Jon Starbuckle and his prototype starfighter, Gar-Type D, to save the Earth from lasagnnihilation.\n Read more",

That's because the studio is still working on the tech behind it all, and plans to release two other games before it. Meaning it'll be 10-15 years before it actually comes out. \nGreene describes Artemis as an internet-like platform where users create and share things, but doesn't say specifically what those things might be. He doesn't know how his user-led \"multiverse of worlds\" will be moderated, or how it will prevent copyright infringement, or what makes this idea distinct from, say, Roblox.

But this is the first time they've properly blogged about it, sharing details of a gruelling switchover to Unreal Engine 5 and a couple of new screens.

I think that's the big theme of my selection box: being grounded within my player character. I want to feel what it's like to hike through canyons with too much sellable loot in my backpack. I want to park my soul in the head of a scared Scotsman way out of his depth, hundreds of miles from shore. The closer I can comfortably fit in my character's shoes, the more I seem to buy into the world they inhabit. Even if that world is constantly glowing a magnificent crimson. \nRead more",

          "description": "My selection box isn't really a selection box. It's a tray of barely-nibbled leftovers, hastily lifted from my Steam backlog. One of the disadvantages of being news editor, you see, is that I have  developed a goldfish-grade attention span. In my hectic pursuit of the next scoop, or the next Elden Ring update changelog, I snatch and cast aside game demos like a pickpocket speedrunning the checkout line at Harvey Nichols. I'm dimly aware that some of these cast-aside games are Very Good. A few might even deserve to be played for longer than 30 minutes. I feel immensely guilty about that. Perhaps a little... existential, too. I have measured out my life in tutorial levels. \r\n\n\r\nSo! Rather than digging out three of the games I've actually completed this year, such as The Crush House, Death Of A Wish and Mask Quest, I'm going to gamble on recommending a few I've barely scratched, but which sure feel excellent and have attracted a positive critical consensus. If I am false in this assessment, may Horace the Endless Bear bite my head off for my impudence. Let's begin.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Chcete se pochlubit technickými vánočními dárky? Pak doražte na Virtuální Bastlírnu - online pokec (nejen) techniků a bastlířů!\r\n\r\n\r\nPokud by se konverzace zadrhla, mají organizátoři ze Strahovské Bastlírny připravena i náhradní výplňová témata. Velká studnice je to, co se dělo na hackerské konferenci CCC (Chaos Communication Conference) mezi svátky - mluvilo se tam o tom, jak se dá shodit rozvodná síť po rádiu, jak hacknout nový procesor Raspberry RP2350 a o tom jak pokračuje hackování vlaků v Polsku.\r\n\r\n\r\nI na svět hardware jsou Strahováci připraveni. Na internetu se objevil postup, jak \"snadno\" vyrábět doma plošné spoje s pomocí výkonného vláknového laseru. Také se v diskuzi našel skvělý spis o tom, jak poznat falešné teploměry DS18B20 a co to vlastně znamená.\r\n\r\n\r\nA nebojte, i na bizár může dojít. Věděli jste, že největší sériově vyráběná CRT televize váží přibližně 200 kilogramů a na světě se už ví jenom o jedné existující? A že Windows interně zkoušejí konvertovat znaky z UTF-16 do ASCII podle jejich grafické podobnosti, což vede k velkému množství elegantních exploitů?\r\n\r\n\r\nPříští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat v úterý 14. ledna od 20:00 (pozor, změna) minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.",

          "description": "In a trailer published through IGN, Kaizen Game Works (developers of Paradise Killer) has revealed some of the voice cast for Promise Mascot Agency. I hope you’re ready for some recognizable tongues in your ears.\n\n\nMost prominently, the leading dude, Michi, is getting vocalized by Takaya Kuroda, the voice of Kazama Kiryu in the Yakuza/Like a Dragon series. What better person to play a disgraced Yakuza? No one. There is no one better, because he plays the best one. I don’t know how else to describe this, but he has a huggable voice. If you’re not a hugger; a high-fiveable voice.\n\n\nTrailer via IGN\n\n\nThe other revealed cast members are no slouches, either. Pinky (that bizarre severed finger mascot that features so much in the marketing) is voiced by Ayano Shibuya, who was featured in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Princess Peach: Showtime. If you don’t recognize her, it’s probably because you weren’t playing in Japanese. There’s also Eri Saito, who voiced so much in Japanese gaming, but you’d maybe recognize her from Way of the Samurai 3. No? Okay, Chainsaw Man, where she played Aki’s Mother.\n\n\nOn top of the famous vocalists, there are less conventional choices. This includes Swery65, who isn’t really known for voice acting, but did create Deadly Premonition. And then there’s. Wait. Shuhei Yoshida? Haha, really? The former president of Sony Interactive Entertainment.\n\n\nIf you’re not familiar, Promise Mascot Agency is a game about a former Yakuza running an, er, agency for mascots. The big foam costume kind. You have to send them out to various events and help them succeed. You also get to drive around in a Kei truck, which is an important touch.\n\n\nPromise Mascot Agency is set for release on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, and PC sometime this year (2025).\n\nThe post Promise Mascot Agency’s insultingly star-studded voice cast includes Swery65 and the voice of Kazama Kiryu appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Gordon Ramsay is infamous for being the foul-mouthed, though well-meaning restaurateur responsible for Kitchen Nightmares, Hotel Hell, and Hell’s Kitchen. In a move that possibly nobody expected, he’s been temporarily toned down and is guest-starring in mobile farming sim Hay Day. \n\n\nYes, you read that correctly. Fans spotted the interesting development before the official announcement came from Supercell via Facebook, with some taking to Reddit to voice their confusion as to why Greg’s Farm was now “Gordon Ramsay’s Farm” before the new name temporarily disappeared with zero explanation. \n\n\n\n\nIn the early hours of January 15, Supercell revealed that Gordon Ramsay was indeed coming to Hay Day on a temporary basis, filling in for Greg while he’s away on his fishing trip. Gordon will be around until January 24, helping players to look after their farms while bringing a host of time-limited events to complete and rewards to collect.\n\n\nOf course, Supercell couldn’t let this moment slide without mentioning at least one of Gordon’s most infamous moments. At one point during the reveal as part of the latest installment of Dairy News, one presenter can be seen with a slice of bread being held on either side of her face, before she goes on to label herself a “confused sandwich”. This is tamer than the actual Kitchen Nightmares moment they’re paying homage to, when Gordon made a contestant cry while calling them an \"idiot sandwich\". \n\n\n\n\nI can't help but wonder how Gordon Ramsay, of all people, ended up in partnership with Hay Day, but in a separate trailer starring the man himself, he seems to be in search of inner peace, and Hay Day is definitely good for that. Creating your own idyllic farm and forming connections with others, looking after the animals, and making money by selling your produce definitely feels like a calming way of life.\n\nThe post The strangest collab of 2025?

          "description": "Set some time aside in April, because GungHo has announced that the Lunar Remastered Collection will arrive on April 18, 2025 for PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.\n\n\nI feel like we keep getting Lunar re-releases, but I looked it up and the last one was actually in 2010 for the PSP. Or 2012 if you count mobile. Still, it’s seen a lot of second chances for a game that original released on Sega CD back in 1992.\n\n\n\n\nLunar Remastered Collection combines Lunar: The Silver Star and Lunar 2: Eternal Blue, or rather, the PS1 version of those. And while it’s titled “remastered” it largely has the same graphics as those releases with some added effects. It’s still 2D and pixelated, which is fine (or even preferred) by me, but doesn’t feel like it earns the title. Unless you count that gross depth-of-field effect they put on the top and bottom of the screen. I guess the cutscenes seem to be remastered, so it counts. Whatever, I'm not the remaster police.\n\n\nIt looks like you can turn off the gross depth-of-field effects, or, at the very least, play it in classic mode. This might also mean you lose the widescreen mode, but maybe you can tweak things. Either way, you’ll have the same classic games in a new package, so that’s worth a lot.\n\n\nThere will also be a physical version available for $54.99 USD. They will notably feature “reversible covers showcasing two new key arts for LUNAR: Silver Star Story Complete and Lunar 2: Eternal Blue Complete, both illustrated exclusively for the Lunar Remastered Collection by Toshiyuki Kubooka.”\n\n\nLunar Remastered Collection launches on April 18, 2025, for PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.\n\nThe post Lunar Remastered Collection set for release in April appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "In a blog post on its official website, Blizzard today announced the next season of Diablo 4 will be the Season of Witchcraft. Set to release on January 21 at 1 p.m. EST, the Season of Witchcraft will add new enemies, Witchcraft powers, rewards Occult Gems, and more.\n\n\n\n\nThe primary seasonal feature of the Season of Witchcraft is, well, Witchcraft Powers. These seasonal-specific powers grant players new abilities and augment and empower existing skills. As players interact and progress through the story of the Coven, a group of Witches trying to serve the powerful Tree of Whispers, they will unlock new Witchcraft powers to use.\n\n\nSeason 7 also adds some pretty welcome quality-of-life updates to the core game that will affect both the seasonal realm and the Eternal Realm, including The Armory which allows players to save and swap builds on the fly, an update to class quests and greater affixes, and a welcome back booster for returning players.\n\n\nThe Season of Witchcraft also adds eight new Unique Items, as well as eight new Legendary Items for players to make builds around. Those who have the Vessel of Hatred expansion will also get access to three new runes, and 15 existing runes have been updated.\n\n\nAs with previous seasons, Season 7 will add new seasonal rewards including a Raven Pet that players can unlock via progression through the Seasonal Journey and Battle Pass.\n\n\nOverall, this reminds me a lot of the Season of Blood which added seasonal-only Vampiric Powers, though until I see it in action it's hard to tell. I hope Blizzard eventually starts making seasons around meaningful mechanics that get added to the core game rather than one-off seasonal exclusive sources of player power that are removed when the next season releases.\n\n\nDiablo 4 Season 7, the Season of Witchcraft, goes live on all platforms next week on January 21, 2025.\n\nThe post Diablo 4 Season 7 goes mystical with Season of Witchcraft appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, his enthusiasm for Microsoft’s first foray into the console market has left me with a lasting affection towards the massive brick of hardware.\n\n\nWith just short of 1000 games, it had a larger library than Nintendo’s GameCube, but a much smaller one than the PS2. It sold an estimated 24 million, which gave it a small lead over the Gamecube’s estimated 22 million. Most importantly, it solidified Microsoft as a big player in the console market that endures to this day.\n\n\nToday, I…",

          "description": "Since its inception, the Roblox community has been a driving force behind the push for an increased friend limit. By October 2024, the community's efforts had sparked rumors of a boost, and the change was set to come to fruition by early 2025.\n\n\nNow, the long-awaited moment has arrived for a new update, and we're here to show you how many friends you can have in Roblox.\n\n\nWhat is the friend limit on Roblox?\n\n\nThe new Roblox update lets you have up to 1,000 friends in your network, unlike its previous 200 limit. The friend system has evolved over the years, starting with the early days of unlimited friends and the Best Friend feature. Roblox developers then simplified it by limiting the system, seemingingly to improve its mechanics.\n\n\nCuriously enough, there have been no announcements regarding the 1,000 friend change, whether it be on the Developer Forum or its Twitter/X account. Even though there hasn't been an official confirmation, I've checked several accounts, like the popular user Roblox_RTC, and see they've hit the 1,000 mark.\n\n\nImage via Roblox\n\n\nGiven the recent end-of-the-year roadmap from the Developer Forum, we could get more concrete information with an early 2025 round-up. While we wait for official announcements, you can already experience the new friend limit for yourself and go on adventures with the title's many games. And who knows? There might be even more increases in the future. If you're one of those who need more than 1,000 friends, kudos to you; I don't even think I know that many people.\n\n\nThe year 2025 promises many other exciting new elements for Roblox, including improvements to avatar settings and additional creator/user tools. The Jan. 6-10 weekly recap also mentions more preventions for account farming that's been used to exploit Roblox features. Further fixes to the platform will continue to be released for a more balanced and smoother experience, making Roblox bigger than it already is.\n\nThe post How many friends can you have on Roblox? appeared first on Destructoid.",

Everhood 2 is set to launch on March 4, 2025.\n\n\nEverhood was one of the first games I reviewed as a full-ish staff member at Destructoid. I didn’t love it! While a lot of what I cited as a problem in my review was technical related, the truth is that there was a story thematic later in the game that I found to be, um, problematic. But it’s buried so deep in there that I would have had to spoil quite a lot to have really gone into it in depth.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, I did mention other problems like weak characters and the fact that it tries to pull the subversive fake ending nonsense way too many times. I don’t think about Everhood very often these days, and I’ve lost quite a few specifics in my memory, but I still remember the general issues I have with it.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I don’t think it was a bad game. It showed promise, and I think that could be delivered on in a sequel. Storytelling is a skill that can be built, after all, and the gameplay was pretty rad. A lot of it was like Guitar Hero, but instead of strumming the notes, you avoid them. Twists would constantly get thrown in along the way, and it could get pretty intense.\n\n\nThe details on the narrative are a bit hard to follow. It seems that you’ll be playing an avatar of yourself, and you’re “on a quest to slay the mysterious Mind Dragon before the world decays.” All right. It promises over 100 songs and will last 8-10 hours. That’s, like, 2 ½ minutes per song. I have a calculator here. Except there’s likely walking and talking to people in between, so that’s not going to be accurate. Or even useful. You’re welcome.\n\n\nEverhood will release on PC and Switch on March 4, 2025.\n\nThe post Weird rhythm-RPG follow-up Everhood 2 launches in March appeared first on Destructoid.",

According to the company, it will reveal brand-new information about some of the most anticipated upcoming games of the year, but it seems it also has a special surprise prepared for its viewers...\n\n\nWe know that the Xbox Developer_Direct will feature three video games, DOOM: The Dark Ages, South of Midnight, and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.

          "description": "Ho, ho, ho, Santa is in town. And he’s brought a gift with him. Here’s a shiny new package for you to unwrap, containing the first beta version of the upcoming OpenTTD 15 release. It comes faster, with road waypoints, fewer passwords, better scenario editor, and hopefully with a lot less bugs. To be a bit less vague, here are some of the highlights: Improved picker windows for stations/waypoints/objects/and more. Oh, and that does include road waypoints. Better perfomance in various places, including faster path signals that are now green by default. Password-less network authentication using keys. Several improvements for NewGRFs regarding cargo support. Better scenario editor with a town data importer and manual house placement. A large tree fully hung with ornamental bugfixes. Sadly though, not everbody was good this year. The old NPF pathfinder was finally retired, after YAPF being the superior default for many, many years now. There’s a lot of bugs left for you to find, though, guaranteed. Enjoy the beta, test all the things and report anything you find amiss, to make OpenTTD 15 the best OpenTTD 15 ever.

Hudebně vychází z původní lidové písně a již dávno zažité sestupné basové linky původně inspirované čardášem. V monumentální instrumentaci zaznívá důstojné a bohaté \"hradní\" Maestoso s výraznou smyčcovou figurací a dramatické Presto s vypjatým protihlasem tak kontrastně jako dunajské nížiny a Vysoké Tatry.
