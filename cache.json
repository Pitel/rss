There’s also a standalone benchmark tool that you can download from the game’s Steam page, so you can see for yourself how the beast-biffing RPG will run on your hardware.\nIn theory, these are great developments. Lower requirements mean a more widely accessible game, and the benchmark tool – which covers a good six minutes of combined cinematics and simulated free roaming – brings reassurance and accountability to this otherwise hype-reliant prerelease period. Sadly, there are two problems. One, the benchmark confirms outright that Monster Hunter Wilds will run like stagnant goulash on low-end PCs, and two, it does so to the extent that I’m not sure that the revised minimum specs are even reliable.\nRead more",

          "description": "Vendrán Las Aves - \"The Birds Will Come\" - is a brief, quiet, hopeful game about burnout recovery. Summarised as a \"slice of life tamagotchi\" and available in Spanish and English, it's a gamejam production from Francisco Riolobos, Chuso Montero and Deconstructeam, the Valencia-based developers behind The Red String Club and The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood.\nIt's free to download from Itch.io, and takes the form of a snowglobe perspective of somebody's one-room apartment. The person in question has just left their job after a rough spell, and has impulsively bought a guitar. They are also, however, totally exhausted, with barely the willpower to do anything beyond getting out of bed, let alone make music. Your task is to help them through each day and rebuild their morale till they feel able to pluck a few chords.\n Read more",

Firstly, some heavy slowdown while roaming Trosky Castle, the centerpiece of the opening Bohemian Paradise region, which I resolved by quitting and reloading. Secondly, a mildly terrifying moment in a dugout when a wounded soldier I was supposed to be treating struck a T-pose, as though afflicted by lightning early onset arthritis. And thirdly a repeated crash bug which I feel warrants its own article given that, together with Deliverance 2's eccentric saving system, it cost me several hours of progress.\r\n \nRead more",

Thanks, Eurogamer. For first noticing the case, I mean. I'm not blaming Eurogamer for the drone crash. Not this one, anyway.\nThe drone was traced back to Akemann, who has agreed to plead guilty to one count of unsafe operation of an unmanned aircraft. That's a misdemeanour that usually carries up to one year prison time, but he's \"hoping to escape the prison term in exchange for 150 hours of community service in support of wildfire relief and the approximately $65,000 USD it cost to repair the plane,\" write Eurogamer, as part of a plea agreement.\nRead more",

He wouldn't be lying in his very own chamber with its very own hole for shitting in - and in any case, it's more than her job's worth to treat him otherwise. In a timid, not quite spiteful show of reverse class policing, she refuses to end the dialogue until she's dismissed in a manner befitting her station.\n Read more",

This peaked in Clive Barker's Jericho, a shooter so desaturated it felt like the colour settings on your monitor were banjaxed. I have heard this called \"the piss filter\" and generally lamented in industry circles. But it was always a puposeful choice, intended to add some grittiness to the world. And there's at least one developer who is reviving \"smeared dirt\" as an art direction.

It is, in fact, a rather nifty collection of upscaling improvements that can help out older graphics cards as readily as the very newest, while building on DLSS 3’s frame generation tool with Multi Frame Generation (MFG) to send visual smoothness skyrocketing. If you care even the slightest iota for how your PC performs in modern games, DLSS 4 demands your attention.\nHere, then, I’ll break down DLSS 4’s various tricks and components, looking at how they really affect performance – and whether it’s worth upgrading your rig to maximise compatibility with it.\nRead more",

Well, part of a poem. Both to free up room on the disc and perhaps, to edit out \"the vast sorrows and all the vexations\" of the second half, only the first two stanzas appear. The recording in fact ends halfway through a line, which conjures up an intriguing problem for the listener, inasmuch as the thwarted rhyme scheme reveals that the piece is incomplete. A poetically-minded alien might be tempted to fill in the gap. A fancier alien who took a module in postmodernism might hail the poetics of the fragment.

          "description": "Mere hours before it’s January 30th release – wait, that’s today! – Sony have finally spilled the beans on system requirements for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, as well as the eye-blistering, GPU-rending special features that more powerful rigs can support. Happily, all these ray tracing and frame generation accoutrements seemingly won’t preclude Spidey 2 from working on older, slower PCs as well, as the minimum specs are surprisingly reasonable.\nGranted, they’re only rated for 30fps at a lowly 720p, and you’ll still need to find a honking 140GB of SSD space, but the basic GPU and CPU requirements aren’t too lofty at all. The likes of an RTX 3060 for 60fps/1080p are quite reasonable as well, though you’re staring down the barrel of Nvidia’s pricey RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 cards for high-rez ray tracing.\nRead more",

It's been eight months since PlayStation provoked mass annoyance among PC players by making a PSN account mandatory to play Helldivers 2, and later Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered. They soon walked back the decision for Helldivers 2 after a rough review-bombing but the company didn't seem to fully take the hint. It looks like they've now conceded that, yes, the obligatory sign-up was an unpopular move.\nRead more",

The RTX 3080 was a thing of beauty, only to be tarnished by the worst wheeler-dealing spree (and crypto mining misappropriation) in PC component history. Then the RTX 4080 rocked up with its laughable £1269 / $1199 price tag, a miscalculation so severe that the RTX 4080 Super looked good – despite hardly being any faster – simply for not repeating it. For the new RTX 5080’s sake, you almost want it to be boring.\nIt isn’t. But then, neither is it a blood-boiler like the RTX 4080, nor a largely aspirational show-off piece like the RTX 5090. By maintaining the 4080 Super’s course correction on price while tooling up on compelling DLSS 4 improvements, the RTX 5080 is an agreeable GPU from the off. Particularly, if you’ve got the 4K monitor to take full advantage of it.\nRead more",

Except I can't really make my own pace, can I Bauhaus Bonk? Because the swing soundtrack makes me feel like a plodding buffoon if I'm not responding with appropriate gusto. This is entrapment, game.

She also has only 4* Weak Foot and 4* Skills, making her slightly limited in front of the goal.\n\n\nPark has decent roles, and 90 Pace and 92 Dribbling is decent. However, you'll have to place her in a future evolution if you want to use her in a competitive fashion.

Using a Forecast Tower is among your weekly objectives, but you won't find any quest markers for them. Instead, you'll have to wait until a few storm circles pass.\n\n\nWhere to find Forecast Towers in Fortnite\n\n\nForecast Towers spawn around your Fortnite map just before the third storm circle is announced. They'll appear as satellite dish icons on your map, giving you their exact locations. You'll usually find two or three during each match.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nHowever, these locations change per round. While the buildings will stay in the same spots, only certain ones will activate during your match. In other words, even if you camp a forecast tower, it may not necessarily turn on, forcing you to find a new one.\n\n\nHow to use Forecast Towers in Fortnite\n\n\nOnce you approach an active forecast tower, you'll find a large tower and a small building with a terminal inside. However, you won't be able to unlock the terminal without obtaining an access key. It's time to fight some enemies.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nMore specifically, you'll have to defeat enemies guarding the forecast tower. They'll either spawn right outside the tower or patrol nearby, as shown by a face map icon. They don't have much health, but they can still deal some solid damage if you fight them for a while.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThe guards you encounter will depend on the current Fortnite season. While some seasons had Latverian henchmen, others, like Chapter 6: Season 1, have demon grunts and lieutenants. Upon defeating a guard, they'll drop a Forecast Tower Access Card, which you can use on the terminal to use the forecast tower and finish Fortnite's story and weekly quests.\n\nThe post How to find and use Forecast Towers in Fortnite appeared first on Destructoid.",

But with Compulsion Games behind the wheel, the creators of the intriguing We Happy Few, I was more than willing to dive in.

Mělo to mít nějakou jinou \"message\" než \"když jsi psychopatický gangster, špatně dopadneš\"? Ale docela to uteklo. Jednoznačné mínus a nechtěný (zřejmě?) humor tkví ve skutečnosti, že hlavní hrdinka (t.j. žena) pořád vypadá jako nabušený chlap v paruce a během celého filmu to žádné jiné postavě nepřijde divné.

Ve filmu je mnoho víceminutových scén, při kterých se NIKDO v plném sále ani neuchechtl, a to je tohoto typu snímku na pováženou. (Ilča 40 %)",
