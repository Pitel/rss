Different is beautiful, and Arranger is here to tell us that in the most chipper, heartwarming way.\nYou might have guessed it already, but Arranger is more than just a puzzle game. As the title suggests, it borrows a lot from the role-playing genre, mostly in terms of its story. There are boss fights, dungeons, usable weapons, and gadgets – really, while it could be an RPG, it’s just as akin to a Legend of Zelda title, albeit with a coming-of-age slant.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Movement is the entire basis for the puzzles in Arranger, and is hard to explain without showing you (if you're able to watch the trailer that will be helpful). The world of Arranger is divided into a grid, and you don't move the main character, feisty misfit kid Gemma, across the squares. Rather, imagine that the row or column Gemma is on becomes a travelator, and you control the direction and speed of it. Gemma stands still and you move the ground, and anything on it left, right, up or down - like How To Say Goodbye but with more squares. It's one of those things that makes sense when you're doing it, trust me.\nRead more",

Sergeant Shagbert, Corporal Pieface, I will avenge you in the only way I know how: by posting some words on a website.\n Read more",

Beware slight spoilers for Alan Wake 2 in the passages ahead.\n\r\nDeep in the Dark Place of Alan Wake 2 there is a forest that is not a forest - a zig-zag tunnel adorned with murals of a grisly woodland scene. Entering that tunnel, you find yourself sealed in at either end. But the mural suggests a way out: it changes when you turn around, following an unspoken narrative. It's a device as delicate as the graffiti elsewhere in the Dark Place is obnoxious. In hindsight, it feels like an example of \"metsänpeitto\", a concept from Finnish folklore about forests which, as writer Sinikka Annala explains, saturates the design of Alan Wake 2. It's a fascinating idea I'd love certain much larger, less intriguing video game worlds to learn from.\r\n\n \nRead more",

He shouldn't have slept with the Queen's sister, for example. He shouldn't have insisted his lover subsequently pay him for a confession to absolve herself of the guilt accrued from sleeping with him. He shouldn't have felt safe in a room next to the Queen, a woman described as \"reckless\" in her character traits, and who is perilously close to having a nervous breakdown. This, my holy friend, is how your bed chamber becomes a raging inferno. \nBy the end of my first game of Norland, the village of Nandos (you can name your own settlements) is covered in more blood than the back end of the bard's best work. In storytelling terms, it is a tragedy. In terms of fantasy management games? It is great fun. The failure cascade as waterslide. \nRead more",

Vultures is different to the others, though, in that it's turn-based zombie crunching combined with roguelike scavenging to survive and get more powerful. It's arriving on Steam sometime soon and it's probably worth a looksy if you're after biohazard disposal with a tactical twist.\nRead more",

I'm sorry to report that certain stories won't grab me if they're not ticking along at just the right pace or if they don't pull me in straight away. I'm a needy soul, someone who demands immediacy and a special emotional sauce.\nUntil Then is, without a doubt, the only visual novel-y game I've truly enjoyed. In fact, I'd say I've more than enjoyed it - I think it's superb so far. The teens that drive this story are written with an authenticity I've not encountered before, and the 3D interwoven with the 2D adds some surprising - besides the literal - depth.\nRead more",

It's a VR game, which is a break from the norm for White Owls, the studio run by Hidetaka \"Swery\" Suehiro (then again, what is their \"norm\"?). It's also got a big multiplayer component, with lots of jovial bubble-popping and chicken-squeezing between the comedy blood spurts. And this taste of multiplayer mischief has Swery's head percolating. This game won't be his last dipped toe in the multiplayer ocean, he told us.\n\"In the future,\" said Swery, \"I would like to leverage this experience to challenge myself with something new in the online multiplayer realm (something you probably haven't even imagined yet).\"\nRead more",

          "description": "If there’s one series that can be relied upon to dole out 80-hour helpings of joy straight into my eager face at regularly scheduled intervals, it’s the RPG brawler stylings of Yakuza/Like A Dragon. One could, I believe, make a convincing argument for Yakuza 0 being - if not the best videogame ever made - then at least the most videogame. While this coming October’s Amazon series won’t be the first live action adaption of Yakuza, I am hopeful its episodic format will give its characters a bit more room to breathe. Or, according to Kiryu actor Ryoma Takeuchi in an interview with IGN, to find the love they’ve always longed for.\n \nRead more",

The humble croaker dominates the wholesome category, where they take centre stage in farming sims or as detectives or as green lads who hop over platforms and hurt enemies by lashing them with their tongues.\nSchim is different: you play as a frog of the shadows, not some green attention-seeker. And in a mundane world of vibrant colour, you're to bounce between patches of shade in search of a human pal whose shadow you've been unwittingly severed from. What ensues is a charming puzzler of both freedom and flow, which genuinely has you view everyday environments through the googly eyes of a phantom amphibian. It's a lovely thing, if perhaps not as emotionally charged as it implies early on.\nRead more",

The book stars Raziel, the first-born of his lieutenants, and It’s a canonical prequel story to the original Soul Reaver. I have waited a millennium. Over time, I became less human and more…games blogger. I have had the chance to write about Legacy Of Kain precisely once. You’re goddamn right I’m going to froth at the mouth at even the vague promise of more Shakespearean monologues and time-travelling vampires.\n \nRead more",

Similarly, it’s also a bit of a masochistic ordeal to put yourself through. But, man. What a buzz.\n \nRead more",

Best not speculate.\nAnyway, Fallout London is a huge effort from modders Team Folon that was recently sabotaged when Bethesda treated Fallout 4 to a next gen update to capitalise on the Amazon TV show's popularity, rendering several mods incompatible and breaking a lot of stuff. Team Folon have now fiddled with the workings and sent a Fallout London build to GOG for QA testing, which suggests that release is imminent. The catch, however, is that you will need to downgrade your copy of Fallout 4 to play the mod, because even with Team Folon's last-minute adjustments, Fallout 4 next gen and Fallout London simply don't get on.\n Read more",

Hlavní změnou je použití více jader při kompresi, jelikož moderní NVMe disky jsou nyní rychlejší. S použitím všech jader je komprese obzvláště na vyšších stupních (9 a 12) několikrát rychlejší (5–8×). Dekomprese je již při jednom vlákně rychlá jako NVMe, ale použitím překrývajících se IO operací bylo dosaženo zrychlení o asi 60 %.",

          "description": "When last we heard about the Stardew Valley 1.6 update for the console ports, we were told to have a little more patience while the developer made progress on it. Well, it looks as though we're still waiting, but Eric \"ConcernedApe\" Barone has assured us that things are still in motion.\n\n\nIn fact, in a recent post on Twitter/X, the creator has said that it's \"on my mind every minute,\" in reference to the mobile ports and the next PC update. We can only assume that this also encompassed the big patch that's inbound for consoles, though that's not specifically mentioned.\n\n\n\n\nBarone then adds that announcements will be made when there is \"meaningful news\" to dole out, such as a release date, etc. The mobile versions of Stardew Valley have been particularly front and center on the developer's mind, saying they've been working on it \"every day.\"\n\n\nStardew Valley 1.7 when?\n\n\nWith talk of a new PC update currently in the pipeline, it's tempting to think that this could be version 1.7. However, in a response to someone asking on X, Barone has made it clear that this will be more like 1.6.9, but we're not sure what that update will come with.\n\n\nAdditionally, Barone has also said that they will \"never charge money for a DLC or update for as long as I live,\" encouraging anyone reading to \"screencap this and shame me if I ever violate this oath.\" You heard it straight from the horse's mouth, folks.\n\n\nAt this stage, we're not clear on when the big 1.6 update will begin rolling out on console, but we can make the assumption that it's on ConcernedApe's mind along with whatever the other ideas they're currently working on. In short: things are still happening for Stardew Valley – especially the mobile ports – and it's comforting to know the developer has no intention of nickel and diming us.\n\nThe post Stardew Valley dev says ports and next update are ‘on my mind every minute’ appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Hooded Horse and Digital Sun have released Cataclismo, a siege defense game that has you piecing together buildings, into Early Access today.\n\n\nThe hordes are coming, and the only thing standing between the people and total annihilation is you. Thankfully, you can dig up some rock and put up a few walls.\n\n\nCataclismo is sort of like a tower defense game in the sense that you need to protect something from a horde of enemies. The big difference is that you’re mainly constructing walls and placing units atop them as defensive points. In a sense, it’s more like a modern Rampart, which is pretty exciting.\n\n\n\n\nThe big distinction from a normal tower defense game is that you construct the buildings, piece by piece. You’re not just plopping down fully constructed nodes in the path of enemies, but designing defensive positions for your soldiers.\n\n\nI can see that as either being extremely fun or a massive chore. Build modes are hit-and-miss for me. I can definitely design stuff, but I’d rather just get on with business. Then there’s the possibility that it becomes too repetitive to move to a new level and start building over and over. On the other hand, I do love a good turtling game.

          "description": "In College Football 25, quarterbacks and their plays can often decide the success or failure of any given drive. \n\n\nIn the game, a quarterback needs to have well-rounded stats in several departments to stand apart from the rest of the names on the field. Simply being quick isn't enough, although having good numbers in the speed department does help. Here are the best options you have.\n\n\n10 best quarterbacks in College Football 25\n\n\nIn this list, I have used the OVR rating as the main yardstick for \"best\", as it combines all the attributes of an athlete. \n\n\nPlayer\nOVR\nSPD\nACC\nSTR\nAWR\nJMP\n\n\nShedeur Sanders\n93\n80\n85\n72\n98\n84\n\n\nCarson Beck\n93\n74\n77\n66\n96\n71\n\n\nQuinn Ewers\n92\n81\n83\n56\n97\n76\n\n\nDillon Gabriel\n92\n81\n85\n63\n99\n78\n\n\nJalen Milroe\n90\n91\n93\n75\n92\n89\n\n\nJaxson Dart\n90\n84\n85\n67\n93\n83\n\n\nJalon Daniels\n90\n88\n90\n73\n93\n85\n\n\nKaidon Salter\n90\n87\n92\n62\n94\n90\n\n\nCam Ward\n89\n84\n88\n70\n91\n82\n\n\nCam Rising\n89\n81\n85\n69\n95\n83\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Sanders and Beck have the joint-highest overall ratings among quarterbacks in College Football 25, I like Jalen Milroe: it's essential to play QBs who are really fast. If a quarterback has speed, I have managed to use it to surprise my opponents while going on solo runs (without overusing it). While Milroe has three less overall (90), his Speed (91) is significantly higher than both Sanders and Beck.\n\n\nIf you're someone who swears by pace, check out Nate Anderson of the Commodores. He's the quickest QB in the game (but his overall rating is lower). Ultimately, it's important to use a quarterback whose strengths match your playing style.\n\nThe post Top 10 quarterbacks (QB) in College Football 25 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Like many other loot-based games, The First Descendant has already experienced its fair share of infinite loot farming locations. Intentional or not, the developer is now taking steps to fix one such location, but it is choosing to do it in the best way possible. \n\n\nA hotfix will buff all other farms, not nerf the infinite one \n\n\nA recently discovered loot farming location in The First Descendant is capable of an unlimited output of loot. Called 'The Valby Run' by the community, the Strategic Outpost location within the Fortress can respawn enemy mobs infinitely. As a result, it's capable of offering item drops at around a 2-3 times higher rate than other locations, according to the developer.\n\n\nSince this was completely unintentional and because we're so used to it with other loot-based games, everyone expected this to get patched out sooner than later. Instead, the Director, Minseok Joo has announced Patch 1.0.4. Instead of removing the incredibly high efficiency of loot within this mission, all other Strategic Outpost locations will now match the efficiency. \n\n\nThe First Descendant Patch 1.0.4 notes\n\n\nAlthough the developer originally stated no additional patch will be necessary next week, it will instead deploy a hotfix, titled Patch 1.0.4. It will do the following:\n\n\n\nReduce cooldown time for Vulgus Strategic Outpost\n\n\nRebalance locations for collecting Void Fragments\n\n\nUpdate other farming locations to match efficiency equivalent to The Fortress Outpost\n\n\n\nFar too often we see developers nerf everything fun and efficient into the ground to prevent players from progressing more quickly than intended. As a result, the rare buff-everything-else method the developers of The First Descendant are taking is much appreciated. \n\nThe post The First Descendant dev just announced the best possible fix for an infinite loot farm appeared first on Destructoid.",

The motive is pretty apparent - stop the pass, and the resulting turnover could help to change your team's fortunes. While the process of intercepting the ball isn't rocket science, there are certain mechanics to master.\n\n\nCollege Football 25 Interception guide\n\n\nThe controls in College Football 25 are pretty simple. As your opponent receiver tries to grab the ball, press the Y/Triangle button on your Xbox/PlayStation controller. This will make your defensive player try to catch the ball and attempt to reach it before the offensive receiver.\n\n…",

          "description": "Ahead of 1999, players received the AX-52 assault rifle in Warframe. It’s a weapon that is much more than meets the eye, so if you’re looking for a solid build for the AX-52 to carry you through almost everything Warframe has to offer, look no further.\n\n\nBest AX-52 build in Warframe\n\n\nThe AX-52 is a strong automatic rifle that has a really high critical chance and multiplier. Its status chance is also something to not look past, especially since it only has Puncture as a damage type. Lastly, its passive ability gives you ammo efficiency when firing at the hip and a 100% critical chance bonus when aiming and hitting headshots.\n\n\nWith all that said, here’s a build to really make all of its strengths shine:\n\n\n\nVital Sense\n\n\nCritical Delay\n\n\nMalignant Force\n\n\nRime Rounds\n\n\nGalvanized Aptitude\n\n\nSerration\n\n\nGalvanized Chamber\n\n\nHunter Munitions\n\n\nExilus: Vigilante Supplies\n\n\nArcane: Primary Merciless\n\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nIf you do not have the Galvanized mods, you can replace them with the following:\n\n\n\nGalvanized Aptitude: Heavy Caliber, Hammer Shot, Rifle Elementalist, or Vigilante Armaments\n\n\nGalvanized Chamber: Split Chamber\n\n\n\nWith this mod setup, you’re heavily increasing all the stats above while also adding Viral and Slash to the mix of status procs dealt. It’ll be versatile across all factions, making this a critical machine that chews through armor and health. It'll only struggle a bit against Corpus shields, but it should still do just fine.\n\n\nWhat makes the weapon versatile is that it does great work whether you’re a good shot or not. \n\n\nIf you can’t trust yourself to hit headshots while aiming, then you can opt for hipfire. It won’t deal easy orange criticals, but the ammo efficiency will allow you to stack more viral, slash, and puncture procs onto enemies.\n\n\nEither way, you’re going to be softening up mobs by just spraying and praying with this mod setup. \n\nThe post Best AX-52 build in Warframe appeared first on Destructoid.",

This means there should be a total of two Dendro characters and two Hydro characters, including Nilou herself. Having two of each element means you can trigger Bloom more often, resulting in more Dendro Cores and more explosions.

          "description": "After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.\nJoin Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 1:00 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

The show’s second season premiered on Paramount+ earlier this year. \nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter’s sources, Halo showrunners Amblin, Xbox, and 343 Industries are seeking a new outlet for a potential third season, with Paramount reportedly supporting the move. \n“Paramount+ can confirm that ‘Halo’ will not move forward with a third season on the service,” Paramount said in a statement. “We are extremely proud of this ambitious series and would like to thank our partners at Xbox, 343 Industries and Amblin Television, along with showrunner and executive producer David Wiener, his fellow executive producers, the entire cast led by Pablo Schreiber as Master Chief and the amazing crew for all their outstanding work. We wish everyone the best going forward.”\nAfter years of development, Halo premiered on Paramount+ on March 24, 2022, and stars Pablo Schreiber as Master Chief. Season 1 received a mixed reception from critics and fans, with many lambasting it for deviating from the games’ established lore and characterizations. Season 2, which premiered earlier this year on February 8 and concluded on March 21, was received more positively, with several critics and viewers hailing it as a dramatic improvement. Season 1 currently sits at 70% on Rotten Tomatoes/61 on Metacritic. Season 2 garnered a 90% on Rotten Tomatoes/64 on Metacritic. \nFor our thoughts on Halo Season 1, check out our video reviews of each episode. You can also read our February interview with the showrunners about how they planned to make Season 2 feel more faithful to the games.",

          "description": "Skeleton Crew, the team behind the 2021 side-scrolling action game Olija, and Devolver Digital have revealed an intriguing new project: Forestrike. The game sports a unique premise: as a martial artist, you can foresee and simulate future combat encounters, allowing you to perfect your execution before laying a finger on anyone. \nThe fighter battles to free a captive Emperor from an evil Admiral, and doing so involves mastering Foresight, a meditative technique to mentally predict and play out battles before they unfold (for Dragon Ball fans, think of image training). Gameplay-wise, players are pitted against different combinations of enemy types. They use Foresight to play the battle in advance to find the optimal approach to defeating them while taking little to no damage.\nFor example, using Foresight may help you learn to dodge a charging enemy so they trample an ally, then finish him off by lobbing a nearby weapon. Determining the best approach may take several Foresight attempts, but once you have your strategy down, you then execute the battle in real-time. After winning a fight, a replay feature allows you to rewatch it using slow-motion and other editing tools to study your strategy or generally feel cool about your performance. \n\n\nUsing the Foresight makes Forestrike's combat feel puzzle-like in its execution, and winning fights as flawlessly as possible matters. That’s because you have limited health to fight through multiple stages in a roguelike-style branching map. Along the way, you’ll earn upgrades that carry over to future runs, as well as perks called Techniques that enhance your abilities. \nForestrike is a neat spin on the action genre, and it's slated to launch sometime in 2025 for Switch and PC.",

With its servers regularly buckling under the weight of its players, the game caught lightning in a bottle but petered out when the game finally went 1.0 and simultaneously ceased receiving support in 2022. Now, developer 1047 Games is back with Splitgate 2 and aims to refine the original's winning formula. \n\n\nLike the first game, Splitgate 2 will be a free-to-play 4v4 shooter that arms players with a portal gun and more traditional firearms to battle each other in aerial, dimension-hopping combat. The sequel is being built in Unreal Engine 5 and has a new emphasis on factions. Players can suit up to compete in the Sol Splitgate League as members of one of three groups: the agile Aeros, the time-manipulating Meridian, or the trigger-happy Sabrask. According to a press release, “Factions will grant players the ability to choose and progress based on their preferred gameplay style or competitive strategies.” Splitgate 2 will feature new objective-based game modes across new arenas and upgradable weapons. \nAdditionally, a special Splitgate 2 companion app is available to download now. The app lets players explore the game’s universe through collectibles that unlock in-game rewards when Splitgate 2 launches. It also features quizzes and a new comic series called Splitgate: The Games We Play. The five-issue series will flesh out the backstory of the characters featured in the announcement trailer and additional issues will arrive monthly. \nSplitgate 2 launches in 2025 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

          "description": "Nintendo is, relatively speaking, a family-oriented company. Their games are aimed at kids, their parents, and everyone in between with bright colors, wholesome storytelling, and extremely approachable game design. That said, there are exceptions to this rule, like in this creepy 15-second teaser uploaded to the company's YouTube channel last week. A man in a trench coat wearing a paper bag with a smile drawn on it stares into the camera while a distorted music box plays in the background. The only additional context we got was the hashtag #WhoIsEmio, leaving fans scrambling to figure out what exactly this was hinting at.\nToday, that mystery has been cleared up. Emio, also known as \"The Smiling Man,\" is the star of a new game in the Famicom Detective Club series, which hasn't had a new entry in 35 years. The game was revealed today alongside a video featuring series producer Yoshio Sakamoto, who wrote the first two games and went on to direct titles like Super Metroid and Metroid: Zero Mission. According to him, they decided to make this new entry during their time developing the Famicom Detective Club remakes back in 2021.\n\"In Emio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club, a student has been found dead in a chilling fashion, his head covered with a paper bag with an eerie smiling face drawn on it,\" a press release reads. \"This unsettling visage bears a striking resemblance to a recurring clue in a string of unsolved murders from 18 years ago, as well as Emio (the Smiling Man), a killer of urban legend who is said to grant his victims 'a smile that will last forever.'\" Players will assume the role of a private investigator and set out to solve the case and stop the killer for good.\nEmio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club will be released for the Nintendo Switch next month, on August 29. Hopefully, the titular killer won't murder too many people before then.\nAre you excited to see this series revived? Let us know in the comments!",

Amid a wave of price reductions and other end-of-life updates, nostalgic fans can relive the console's earliest days via a new dynamic background modeled after the old “Blades” interface.\nFor those too young to remember or didn’t get an Xbox 360 until years later, the Blades interface was the console's first dashboard design. It was the first thing players saw from the console’s launch in 2005 until it was updated to an entirely different interface in 2008. Navigating it felt smooth as butter, and some diehards still believe it's the best UI of any Xbox console. \nAlthough it's less detailed, and you can’t flip through the Blades of this dynamic background and hear that satisfying “whoosh” sound, it’s nice to see Microsoft acknowledge the 360's like this. Here’s how you to make the Blades your Xbox background:\nPress the Xbox button on your controller to open the guide.\nNavigate to Profile & system > Settings > General > Personalization > My background > Dynamic backgrounds.\nChoose Xbox 360 Blades under Featured or Xbox dynamic backgrounds\nSelect the background art you want using the A button.\nYou can read more about the impending Xbox 360 store closure and final updates by visiting this Xbox Wire article.",

          "description": "Dead by Daylight’s 8th-anniversary stream revealed a few big updates for the popular asymmetrical horror game. The most immediate is the addition of Lara Croft as the game’s latest crossover survivor along with the impending addition of the much-requested 2v8 mode. \nTomb Raider Chapter\nLara Croft (the 2013 reboot version, specifically) joins DBD today, and though she lacks her pistols and bow, she sports three new perks highlighting her adventuring prowess. Here's an explanation of each per DBD's website:\nFinesse: Your fast vaults are faster when healthy, with a cooldown after a successful use.\nHardened: When you open a Chest and cleanse or bless a Totem, Hardened activates for the duration of the Trial. From that point, every time you scream, you’ll instead reveal the Killer’s Aura.\nSpecialist: When you open or rummage through a Chest, gain 1 Token (up to 3). When you do a Great Skill Check, consume a Token to reduce the max required Generator progress.\n\n\n2v8 Mode\nOn July 25, a new 2v8 multiplayer mode descends into the game. This pits two Killers against eight survivors in expanded versions of five classic maps. The number of generators has been doubled, and Survivors must now repair 8 out of 13 to escape. Captive Survivors are now sent directly into cages, and Survivor perks have been reworked into a new role system designed to encourage teamwork. \n\n\nCross-Progression\nCross-progression is being implemented on July 22. This means players can now sync their progress across multiple owned versions of the game. Everything can be shared across any platform except for Switch, which has a few restrictions as you can see in the chart below. \nToday’s stream also revealed a new trailer and the release date for The Casting of Frank Stone, the single-player DBD game developed by Supermassive Games (Until Dawn, The Quarry). You can read all about that here.",

This intriguing horror collaboration will arrive on September 3, and a new trailer provides a proper introduction of the main cast. \nDeveloped by Supermassive (Until Dawn, The Quarry) and published by Dead by Daylight developer Behaviour Interactive, The Casting of Frank Stone stars five teenagers – Christine Gordon, Jaime Rivera, Linda Castle, Robert Green, and Bonnie Rivera – who film their own horror movie in an abandoned steel mill. Unfortunately, this mill has ties to a notorious murderer named Frank Stone, and the youth’s innocent art project goes horribly wrong.\n\n\nWe still don’t know much about the narrative other than that it is set within the world of Dead by Daylight and takes place in the town of Cedar Mills during the summer of 1980. Gameplay-wise, The Casting of Frank Stone follows a similar blueprint to Supermassive’s previous horror titles in that it’s a choice-driven adventure where characters can be permanently killed off based on your decisions. You can check out a recent gameplay trailer here to see it in action. \nThe Casting of Frank Stone is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

          "description": "Mortal Kombat 1’s final Year 1 DLC fighter arrives next week, and it’s Takeda Takahashi. The young Shirai Ryu warrior makes only his second appearance in a Mortal Kombat game and looks every bit as capable as his older clanmates, Scorpion and Smoke. \nAlthough Takeda was Kenshi’s son in his debut appearance, Mortal Kombat X, the remixed timeline of Mortal Kombt 1 has changed him to Kenshi’s cousin. Like Kenshi, Takeda grew up a Yakuza but was more faithful to the clan than his cousin. As such, the Yakuza tasked Takeda with killing Kenshi, and the two battled, with the latter coming emerging victorious. Takeda was mortally wounded in the battle and rushed to the aid of the Shirai Ryu, where Kenshi protected him from being killed by the Yakuza for failing his mission. This causes Takeda to have a change of heart and join the Shirai Ryu to wage war against Earthrrealm’s criminal underground and, eventually, the evil forces of Outworld. \nTakeda still utilizes the Shirai Ryu fighting style, including his signature pair of bladed whips. He also sports shurikens, a barrage of teleporting flame attacks, and an aerial grapple best described as mid-air corkscrew piledriver. Check Takeda out below.  \n\n\nTakeda will be available on July 23, both as a standalone purchase and as a free download for Kombat Pack owners. The same day also sees previously revealed Kameo fighter Ferra become available to buy. Both Takeda and Ferra will be playable for the first time during Evo 2025 this weekend. \nFor more on Mortal Kombat 1, check out our review as well as the trailers for previous DLC fighters Homelander, Omni-Man, Ermac, Peacemaker, and Quan-Chi.",

It was only last year that we played Double Dragon Gaiden, a pixelated throwback brawler (or belt-scroll action game, per its official YouTube description) take on the franchise.\nThis next entry is decidedly more modern, with fully 3D visuals. It's not the first time the series has explored this dimension, but it is a rare occurrence. The game is being developed by Yuke's, the developer that worked on the WWE 2K franchise until 2K19 and most recently developed AEW: Fight Forever. It is being published, or presented by, as the trailer implies, Arc System Works, the developer behind Guilty Gear and Dragon Ball FighterZ.\nDouble Dragon Revive is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and One, and PC sometime in 2025.\n\n\nFor a whole lot more on Double Dragon, but maybe not the version of Double Dragon you're thinking, head here to read all about the 1994 movie. Back in 2019, I tracked down the film's director, James Yukich, to talk about the bizarre film's trajectory, what went wrong, and what he would have done differently had he been giving a chance to try making the film again.",

And later this year, there will be a handful of price increases for various tiers. Here's the exact text as it is presented on Microsoft's website.\nStarting July 10, 2024, the following updates to Xbox Game Pass will take effect:\n    Price changes will go into effect for new members for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, Xbox Game Pass Core, and PC Game Pass.\n    Game Pass for Console will no longer be available for new members.\n    Members who are already subscribed to Game Pass for Console and have automatic payment renewal enabled will be able to continue to enjoy their membership.\nAlso, a new Game Pass option, Xbox Game Pass Standard, will become available in the coming months. These changes will enable us to bring members more value and more great games to Game Pass.\nThe new Xbox Game Pass Standard tier for new members will be $15 a month and will not include access to Day One releases, EA Play, Game Pass for PC, and cloud gaming.\nXbox Game Pass Ultimate, which includes access to all the bonuses now not included in the Standard tier is increasing its price from $17 a month to $20.\nXbox Game Pass Core, which offers online access and a much smaller library of curated games, is changing its yearly from $60 to $75. The $10 monthly price for that tier, however, will remain unchanged.\nPC Game Pass is increasing from $10 per month to $12, but that tier will still include Day One releases.\nAll of these price changes will be reflected starting on September 12.\nPrice changes for services you already pay for are always frustrating. What do you think of the change? Do you plan on maintaining your subscription? Or is it time to cancel?",

Whether it’s an educational look at the natural world, a gripping true crime tale, or an enlightening biography of a noteworthy figure, the best documentaries manage to educate as effectively as they entertain.\nThe video games industry is now old enough to have been subjected to its fair share of documentaries, from The King of Kong to Indie Game: The Movie to Netflix’s High Score. But no matter how good they are, they all generate a tough-to-pin-down anxiety in me I never consciously noticed until recently: By the time the film ends, or, more often, in the middle of it, I just want to stop watching and play the…",

There are also a ton of armor options, too. \nCompanions have an armor slot, a ring slot, an accessory slot, and a weapon slot, while Rook has access to even more – a helmet, two weapon slots, a belt, an amulet slot, and two ring slots. A belt having its own slot might sound odd as it's not an armor piece people typically think of when kitting out an RPG warrior. However, the belt is an important facet of Rook's kit.

In the Resident Evil 4 (RE4) VR port, all it takes is lifting the controller in the air at the right time.\nAnd it’s always satisfying.\nThe parry mechanic is one of the novel additions of the 2023 remake developed by Capcom. Whenever a bolt or melee attack from an infected villager is about to impact Leon Kennedy, you only need to press a button to deflect with the in-game knife. This action grants an opportunity to follow up with an attack on the spot while simultaneously adding to RE4’s original close-quarter smackdown.\nAdapting this to the PlayStation VR2 wasn’t easy. Instead of Leon doing a swift animation with just a button press, you need to grab the knife from your chest, lift it up in the air, and match the incoming attack. I…",

If you’re a gamer, answering those questions requires an additional layer of complexity since we spend much of our free time in virtual worlds.

Owners of these games will still be able to play their single-player content, but online support for these titles will end on November 7. The embedded announcement post on X also includes a link to an FAQ to answer additional questions about the sunsetting process. \nhttps://t.co/2W8dLlGjBM\nJune 28, 2024\nWhile the digital PS3/Xbox 360 versions of these games are going away, Battlefield 3 will still be available to purchase on PC. The same is true for Battlefield 4 and Hardline, and these two titles will also remain on sale for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The PC/PS4/Xbox One versions will remain unaffected by today’s updates.\nIt never feels good to see games get removed from sale like this. The reason likely has to do with EA sunsetting online support; it wouldn't be right to continue selling games with popular online modes if that component doesn't work anymore. For those still logging into Battlefield matches on PS3 and 360, you've got a few more months to enjoy the ride.\nFor more on Battlefield, you can learn about how the next entry is shaping up (which is being made with help by Dead Space remake developer Motive Studios) here.",

And it continues to look like a scary new addition to the A Quiet Place movie universe. \nThough there's still no release date – it's launching sometime this year on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC – this story trailer reveals more about the state of the world in The Road Ahead. It seemingly begins on Day One, when the aliens, which possess incredible hearing that requires people to remain silent to survive, attack Earth. It then jumps ahead to Day 105, with Alex, an asthmatic college student trying to survive the end of the world with her boyfriend Martin, on the hunt for supplies and more. \nCheck it out for yourself in the story trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead below: \n\n\nAs you can see, it seems Alex might be pregnant, which, if you've seen the first A Quiet Place movie, can make trying to remain silent in this world quite difficult. We'll have to wait a little longer to find out how the story of A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead plays out because it launches later this year on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. \nFor more about the game, watch the reveal trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead. \nAre you excited for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead?
