However, with the help of Limited Run Games, the developers are now revisiting this 'lost' chapter in the series, with the now-completed game getting a limited-time release on Game Boy Advance and a wider modern console release courtesy of Limited Run's Carbon Engine later this year.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Truth be told, it’s a niche that the studio completely owns at this point, and though we’re surprised other major players in the video game industry have yet to dive into it themselves, we can’t imagine anybody tackling the form without sneaking a few cheeky glances at Digital Eclipse’s work.\nFollowing on from Karateka, Llamasoft: The Jeff Minter Story is the second in the Gold Master Series and takes a deep dive into the career and mind of Jeff Minter (sometimes referred to as ‘Yak’), an English video game designer and programmer who founded Llamasoft. Though well-known within the industry and by veteran players, you could be forgiven for not knowing a great deal about Minter beyond some of his more famous works, including Tempest 2000, Gridrunner, Akka Arrh, and Attack of the Mutant Camels.

          "description": "Cast your eye over the original Outcast from 1999 today, and you'll find a world that's more abstract than alien. Hazy, almost block colour textures are stretched to breaking point over terrain that looks like it's been pulled and poked by a child sculpting in putty slime, while its cast of beige, three-fingered Talans are so rigid that they'd all be reigning champions at the local robot dance-off. Understandable, given the era in which is was made, but even so - what a difference 25 years make. Even after 2017's remake glow-up with Outcast: Second Contact, A New Beginning's version of Adelpha is a lush and verdant paradise, with treetops soaring over your head, and mountains requiring several triple or quadruple jetpack jumps to traverse. It's no Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora, admittedly, but it leans in very much the same direction, punching your eyeballs with such bright, primary colours that you'll feel enticed to explore every inch of it.\nA shame, then, that all its visual splendour amounts to is little more than an empty husk filled with open world busy work that already felt tired and done ten years ago. Its non-linear approach to storytelling remains intact, letting you tackle the quests and problems of its numerous village settlements in any order you wish, but even this has been boiled down to tedious checklists of fetch quests, escort missions and shooting up the same identikit facility one after another. Topping off this fatal combo is returning protagonist Cutter Slade, whose macho army dude dial is still set firmly to cringey wise-cracking and patronising stereotypes. A new beginning this ain't.\nRead more",

It was a bit of cosy fun for a group of pals, and thankfully, open-ended co-op play looks to be the focus of the next big update, which adds a new sandbox mode that lets you pick rocks and sink pints free of storyline constraints. Not to mention new armour, weapons, and quality of life improvements like the ability to pause your single player sessions.\nRead more",

          "description": "Granblue Fantasy: Relink has received a sizeable game update, which adds a new, difficult quest, The Final Vision, some additional camera and aim sensitivity settings, and new Steam trophies. That's in addition to a brace of bug fixes, character-specific balancing tweaks for multiplayer, and assorted quality-of-life improvements, including visual and audio indicators to indicate when you've lost your buffs.\r\n\n\r\nOur Alice B described Cygames' latest as a \"slick JRPG wedded to the rule of cool\" in our Granblue Fantasy: Relink review, noting that \"the combat is kind of weightless, but it's layered and fun - if you can be bothered to get to the bottom of it\". There are certainly layers to the version 1.1.1 patch notes. The bits about changes to characters are a fusillade of nitty-gritty observations like \"Io should no longer lose the Mystic Vortex status effect even after taking a hit from an attack that removes positive status effects\". Fans of Ghandagoza, meanwhile, will rejoice in the knowledge that they've nixed a problem that stopped you dodging right after performing an aerial barrage, while Cagliostro players will be happy to learn that \"objects transmuted as part of a link attack should now hit foes with greater accuracy\". \r\n\n\r\nI still haven't played Granblue Fantasy: Relink (with suspiciously good timing, Alice B is on holiday today, or I'd have asked her write this piece) and reading the full patch notes feels a bit like trying to glean map directions from waterfalls of Matrix code. I feel like all patch note writers should learn from Larian, whose patch notes are often very funny for all their absurd intricacy.\r\n \nRead more",

But it turned out that the critical perspective was something Nemati appreciated, and so we had a chat that dug down into the meat of it all.

You've got sober infiltration games like Thief, which metes out gradations of light and dark with the care of somebody calculating their tax expenses, and stylised affairs such as Mark Of The Ninja, in which stepping into shadow desaturates you and sort of makes your character far too fancy for enemies to notice.\nThere are games such as Splinter Cell, in which hiding in shadows rests on a gentleman's agreement with NPCs not to perceive the big green torches attached to Sam Fisher's head. And then you have games like Ereban: Shadow Legacy, which has just been given a release date - 10th April. In this mystical third-person stealth-platformer, your character can literally disintegrate and travel through shadows as a ripple of dark energy - a transformation that puts me in mind less of Thief than of squid-mode in Nintendo's Splatoon. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "There are 137 Pals in Pocketpair's monster-catching simulator Palworld, which might sound like plenty, but the serial Palworld player is an insatiable creature, always clamouring for new beasties to capture, pet and exploit, even as the developers encourage fans to play other games while they wait for the next Palworld update. If you've already bagged all the available Pals and are hungry for more, you might be interested in Palworld mod Breed Unreleased Pals, created by ShameIHaveNoFriends, which grants access to three animals who exist in the game's files but are not, strictly speaking, available to players.\nRead more",

          "description": "Who is Jeff Minter? Unless you’re a long-term fan of his work, you might have asked that upon hearing about Llamasoft: The Jeff Minter Story, the latest interactive documentary from Digital Eclipse (following on from The Making Of Karateka and Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration). You might have heard Minter’s name in connection with the remake of the unreleased Atari arcade game Akka Arrh in 2023. Maybe you played his mind-warping shooter Polybius in VR. You might remember as far back as the Atari Jaguar and Minter’s phenomenal Tempest 2000, the unexpected highlight of the console’s library. Or perhaps you recall his work from the 8-bit glory days. You could just know him from the daily videos of him feeding his sheep on YouTube.\r\n\n\r\nThe point is that Jeff Minter has been making games for a phenomenally long time – more than 40 years, in fact. And in all that time, he has stayed true to what he believes in. “One of the things we say in the game itself is the idea of him being the last indie developer,” says Chris Kohler, editorial director at Digital Eclipse in California. “The last of the people from the early 80s who very consciously never sold out, never took the money, never looked to expand or do anything other than [be] just Jeff at his computer, making the sorts of video games that he wants to make.”\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's just designed in an \"agnostic\", systems-first way and this in itself makes stealth a possibility.

Sure, Bloodlines 2 might prove a winner, but given years of delays and a developer change, I'll believe it when I see it.\nWhich brings us to Vampire: The Masquerade - Justice, the beleaguered series' first prowl through the rain-slick streets of VR. In theory, this should be exactly my cup of haemoglobin; a gothic, linear stealth game where you use your vampire powers to sneak across the rooftops of Venice. In its mechanics and design, Justice aspires to be a cut down version of Dishonored. Unfortunately, it's in the cutting down where most of its problems arise. It's too cramped, too basic, and too fuzzy around the edges, and the whole experience ends up being a bit mid.\nRead more",

Is Dune appropriative? Is the appropriation the point? Whatever the case, Funcom want you to know that their upcoming survival game Dune: Awakening has nothing to do with any of that, posting a short Xeet from the official Awakening account that's the written equivalent of sticking your arms straight out, waving your hands, and going \"Woahwoahwoah, hang on a minute.\"\n\"We agree that religion is an integral part of the Dune universe. This is why in Dune: Awakening you will meet and interact with people of different religions along your journey. However, as opposed to the story presented in the books, the player is not a messiah and will not play a major role in any of them. Leading people on a holy war is not why you arrive on Arrakis,\" reads the post in full. Personally, I approve of this effort to keep games apolitical. Politics? In my Dune. No thank you. I am of course being facetious. There is still religion and politics in Dune: Awakening, as confirmed by the statement, but you yourself aren't doing much of it.\nRead more",

There's been a certain amount of PlayStation-instigated speculation about whether the meat is CGI-generated, following the last round of Dragon's Dogma 2 previews. Speaking to Japanese site 4Gamer, as translated by Automaton, Itsuno revealed that the game's scenes of sizzling flesh are derived from live action film of steaks being grilled - partly for the sake of authenticity, and partly to save money versus creating computer models of meat products. You can cook several types of meat in Dragon's Dogma, each of which has its own cutscene, and a number of Dragon's Dogmatists are already performatively salivating at the prospect on social media.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Towards the conclusion, one NPC is selected as \"Beloved\" and promptly abducted by a dragon for you to quest forth and rescue. There are a few characters who are positioned more obviously as romanceables, but the brilliance of the system is that you can raise your Affinity with pretty much anybody. If you want to finish the game staring passionately into the eyes of the court jester or that hearty bloke who runs the armour shop, it's within your power.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Zoria: Age Of Shattering speedruns its fantasy RPG origin story in a quick cutscene montage at the start, so we might as well get that out of the way first, too. Low fantasy world, two warring kingdoms, one uses necromancy (this is cast as bad and cheating rather than practical, for some reason) to comprehensively gain the upper hand, and everything is named like a bunch of Scrabble letters were thrown randomly on the table. You play Elion war hero Captain Witherel - gender and class TBD by the player - in a small group making a final stand at the fortress Daeg Marastir, which is being overrun by the nefarious Izirian army. We start in media bellum, as it were.\nThis first stage, where you escape the fortress, gives you a whistle-stop tour of the main systems in the game. You control a squad of four, the combat is turn-based, you can pitch camp at any time to rest and heal up, and there are crafting systems for potions, food and gear. Zoria isn't really remaking the wheel as much as it is taking spokes from a bunch of other fantasy RPGs you like, and the result is the terrier of RPGs. Small, clearly has a lot of different DNA knocking around in there, and punches above its weight, but it's a bit scrappy and sometimes it's knees dislocate and it falls over. This terrier was made by three people, so that is sort of to be expected.\nRead more",

          "description": "Since the summer of 2020, Unknown 9: Awakening has only existed as a 90-second cinematic teaser trailer. In it, a young girl called Haroona is chased through the narrow streets of Calcutta by a rabble of boys armed with sticks. It's not clear why she's attracted their ire, but as one moves to strike her, a shockwave pulses out from her small body, the world turns grey, and time slows down. As she deftly moves out of harm's way, she turns back to look at her stunned onlookers, a confident smirk rising on her face.\nIt was a striking, if utterly ambiguous debut, and with talk of accompanying podcasts, books, comics and a web series also on the way to help build out this new world even further, it felt like developers Reflector Entertainment were really setting out to make a bold and ambitious first impression. But it's now been four years since that trailer. The books, podcasts and comics have all come and gone, seemingly making little impression, and Awakening, the game aiming to pull this big, expanded universe together, has arguably slipped from both time and memory. Perhaps this will change with its newly-dated summer 2024 release window on the horizon, but having seen a small, hands-off slice of an early mission in the game at publisher Bandai Namco's offices a couple of weeks ago, Awakening's certainly got its work cut out for it.\nRead more",

I'll be honest, I'd assumed the series had died, but Steam user reviewers seem pretty keen on Trials, which takes the first game's mucky asylum premise and spins it out into a low-key live service game about playing a series of human guinea pigs, trying to escape an experimental brainwashing lab run by the villainous Murkoff Corporation. \r\n \nRead more",

The first was to discover if there's anything genuinely different about this undeniably enchanting but very familiar sequel to one of the happiest, barmiest action-RPGs of the past 20 years. The second was to royally screw myself by fielding a party consisting exclusively of magic-users. \r\n\n\r\nIn Dragon’s Dogma 2 as in Dragon’s Dogma 1, you lead a gang of up to three AI-controlled \"pawn\" characters – one permanent main sidekick who levels up alongside you, plus two auxiliary pawns created by other players, who are either summoned at Rift stones or spawned into the open world as hired help. As in most RPGs, the ideal party setup is a mix of pure melee, ranged and magical DPS or support classes, but given the whimsicality of Dragon’s Dogma’s sorcery, with its levitation spells and lightning whips, I’ve always wanted to try a whole playthrough as a posse of unescorted occultists.\nRead more",

          "description": "As someone who finds games about cars wot go fast only intermittently interesting, I'd expect a game about cars wot go slow to be positively soporific. Speed is, ultimately, the modus operandi of a car. It gets you where you need to go faster than a horse, and doesn't do annoying things like pooing on your patio or dying (also, potentially, on your patio). Surely, then, playing a game about cars moving at the speed of a dead patio horse defeats the point, like playing a first-person shooter where all the guns fire backwards.\r\n\n\nExpeditions: A Mudrunner Game demonstrates this not to be the case. This bouncy, slimy off-roading simulator is the most fun I've had with an imaginary car since 2018's Jalopy. This is partly because it is as much a physics puzzler filled with limitless conundrums as it is a game about driving, but also because, like Jalopy, it envisions the car as something more than a way to boost egos by doing a big circle.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "It's always interesting when veterans of the gaming industry break off and start new endeavors. And they don't come much bigger than emptyvessel (yes, it's really spelled that way), which is a team of developers consisting of some notable names from the likes of id Software and Naughty Dog.\n\n\nIn a recent video uploaded to YouTube, the new studio has been teasing a work-in-progress. It's a very short clip that reveals nothing, but the \"glitchy\" visuals, hints of violence, and the soundtrack give strong Cyberpunk 2077 vibes. To me, at least.\n\n\nSo far, there's been absolutely no details about what this project is, other than it being described as a \"battle between control and chaos that the system has in store for you.\" We do, however, know that it's got some pretty good pedigree behind it.\n\n\n\n\nJust look at this collective experience\n\n\nLooking at the emptyvessel website, we get to meet the team behind the studio. We're definitely not dealing with amateurs here. For example, general manager Garrett Young has worked with id Software on Doom, Quake, and Rage, but has also worked at Microsoft and Activision.\n\n\nArt Director Alex Palma also has Doom attached to their resume, being a visual designer on the 2016 reboot and Eternal. Alongside them is Colin Thomas, a character designer who spent 15 years at Naughty Dog, working on things like The Last of Us and Uncharted.\n\n\nOh, and Mick Gordon is also part of the team. Guess what his role is?\n\n\nBasically, there's a lot of skill and experience in this new development team. I can already picture the type of games emptyvessel will be pushing out, but I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nThe post Former id Software and Naughty Dog devs are teasing a new project appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Far be it from me to tell you about the current state of the video game industry. Layoffs and studio shutdowns are just one part (big though it may be) of the problem. On top of that, it's also been speculated that consumer spending could drop this year, so it may be up to the likes of GTA 6 to perk things up a bit.\n\n\nThat's according to an interview with Circana analyst Mat Piscatella over on Gamesindustry.biz. According to him, spending on video games in the US could come down by 2% on the more optimistic side. In a worst-case scenario, it could go as low as 10% or even more.\n\n\n\n\nThere are likely a number of factors that could contribute to this, such as the ongoing cost-of-living crisis. However, the report believes that the lack of blockbusters coming in 2024 could also be a reason. For example, we're not going to see GTA 6 or the new Nintendo Switch until 2025, all being well.\n\n\nHelldivers 2 and Palworld can only do so much\n\n\nPiscatella ends by saying that it's \"going to be a tough year,\" but we may see a boost providing things like interest rates come down. He also believes that the eventual (and long-awaited) release of GTA 6 could give the industry a \"renewed batch of interest.\"\n\n\nThe analyst suggests the anticipated follow-up to Grand Theft Auto 5 is vital to the gaming market, saying that there's \"probably never been a more important thing to ever release in the industry.\" He then adds \"so no pressure.\"\n\n\nThis is a rather pessimistic view of the future of video games, but some might say these are rather pessimistic times. Consumer spending in the US could come down by a fair amount, but we should hopefully see a boost. It seems a lot may be riding on the success of GTA 6.\n\nThe post GTA 6 could be the ‘most important thing to ever release,’ analyst says appeared first on Destructoid.",

Although E3 is no longer with us – for good or ill – it's at least being replaced by Summer Game Fest. Recently, the date for the event was confirmed.\n\n\n\n\nAs for what's being showcased, we don't know that just yet. You can expect there to be a decent amount of buzz surrounding the event as we get closer to June, though. For those who want to attend, public tickets will be going on sale from May 7.\n\n\nWhen and where to watch Summer Game Fest 2024\n\n\nAs mentioned in a recent post from Geoff Keighley, SGF 2024 will be streaming live on Friday, June 7. Keighley describes it as a \"cross-platform LIVE showcase of what's next for video games.\" A post on Twitter/X from the official Summer Game Fest account says it will be a two-hour event.\n\n\nLast year's Fest was a pretty big hit, especially after the cancellation of E3 following a few years of uncertainty about the event. Summer Games 2023 saw showcases from the likes of Capcom, Xbox (Starfield in particular - remember how hyped we were about that?), and Final Fantasy XVI.\n\n\nBefore the summer period hits though, there are some other events and conferences, such as PAX East (March 21), the London Games Festival (April 9), and more. We've also got Day of the Devs coming up this Sunday.\n\n\nKeighley began Summer Game Fest in 2020 in the wake of COVID-19.

          "description": "I would argue Sea of Stars was the best indie game of 2023. I'd even go as far as saying it deserved more space in the game of the year conversation, but that's an argument for another time. With 5 million copies sold, Sabotage Studio has announced a new co-op mode coming to the RPG in a future update.\n\n\nSea of Stars is getting three-player couch co-op\n\n\nSea of Stars just surpassed 5 million copies sold, and as a reward, players are getting 'Single Player+' mode, teased in a new trailer. The short version is that it will allow players to team up with two friends locally on their RPG adventure. Since the indie game plays like a classic turn-based RPG, how will that work?\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Staying true to the game’s core turn-based roots, each player will engage in traversal and combat with a new 'Co-op timed hits' mechanic as they embark with friends on Sea of Stars’ grand adventure. The new mode is currently in development and more details are set to be released soon.\"\nSabotage Studio\n\n\n\nA new reason to go back and play Sea of Stars again sounds good to me. Along with the ability to play with a few buddies, we also get some new combat and traversal mechanics, though they haven't been thoroughly explained just yet. 'Co-op timed hits' likely refer to the attack and defense timing, which require the player to tap a button right when their character makes contact with an attack or the enemy attack hits. This results in extra damage on attack and significantly lowered damage taken on defense. Using context clues, it seems that in co-op, those bonuses will require all players to perfectly time the hits.\n\n\nThat should make for chaotic gameplay and probably plenty of arguments. Isn't that exactly what you want out of a couch co-op experience?\n\nThe post Hit Indie RPG Sea of Stars is getting three player couch co-op appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, given that it only lasts 30 minutes, timing is crucial for the entire process. So, if you aren't quite sure how to utilize the item, we'll show the best time to use a Lucky Egg in Pokémon Go.\n\n\nBest time to use a Lucky Egg in Pokemon Go\n\n\nTrainers can use the Lucky Eggs for the following objectives in Pokémon Go:\n\n\n\nFriendship Levels (Ultra Friends or Best Friends)\n\n\nCatching and evolving Pokemon\n\n\nSpecial events\n\n\nSpecial Research tasks\n\n\nSeven-day streaks\n\n\nRaids\n\n\n\nThe first option allows you to earn double XP when reaching a certain point for a Friendship Level. I recommend increasing companionships with gift exchanges initially and then using the Lucky Egg when it's about to reach Ultra Friends or Best Friends. Preparations are a good way to go in order to maximize the egg's benefits. In particular, it's an excellent idea to catch Weedles, Pidgeys, and Caterpies beforehand, as they don't require too much Candy for the evolution (another way to get XP).\n\n\nSpecial Events, such as seasonal or recurring celebrations, prolong the Lucky Egg's abilities. This also includes Special Research tasks, so don't claim those rewards until the double XP activates. Catching Pokémon during this time helps, too, but it all must be done within 30 minutes. \n\n\nIf you keep up with Pokémon Go, seven-day streaks are another useful way to take advantage of the eggs. Simply log in every day and catch some creatures to reach that point. Although it will take a while, it all adds up with the right timing. That said, Raids may not be the best choice for the Lucky Eggs since these events can go on longer. It's just an alternative method for those who want a challenge and extra XP. \n\nThe post When should you use a Lucky Egg in Pokémon Go? appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The long wait for the PC release of Final Fantasy XVI may be over sooner rather than later, according to comments made by producer Naoki Yoshida, but it seems as though the game will require some pretty hefty hardware in order to play. \n\n\nThe PC port of FFXVI is currently in “the final stages of [optimization]”, according to Yoshida, who goes on to say that “in a game where loading speed is critical, a HDD would be a pain … please consider that an SSD is a must”. \n\n\nIn a recent discussion, Yoshida suggested that a demo for the game would be coming before the full release, which at least gives players a chance to test whether the game will run on their current setup. \n\n\nImage via Square Enix\n\n\nThere have been no solid words on the exact specifications that will be needed to play FF16 on PC, but there’s hope that the current optimization process will lower the entry barrier in order to get more people playing. \n\n\nWith regards to a solid release date for the game on PC, Yoshida has said that “it won’t be too distant in the future”, before suggesting that we won’t be waiting more than 12 months, provided optimization goes smoothly. \n\n\nBack when Final Fantasy XVI was released on Playstation 5 in June 2023, it was very well received and earned high-scoring reviews. Clive will even be making an appearance in FFXIV during the “The Path Infernal” collaboration event, set to take place in early April.\n\nThe post Final Fantasy 16 should arrive on PC within the year, but you’ll need a pretty powerful machine to run it appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The community-based Major Order quests offer challenging adventures across Super Earth for the chance to earn some much-needed rewards. Unfortunately, not everything runs smoothly with these missions, as many players have experienced issues in their progression. So, if you want to know how to fix Helldivers 2 Major Order not updating, here's what you need to do.\n\n\nHelldivers 2 Major Order not updating, troubleshooting, fix\n\n\nThere's been a lot of confusion surrounding the Major Order quests, causing many to think these objectives are bugged (and I'm not just talking about the ones on the planets.) However, since MO missions are community-based, they must be achieved globally rather than individually. That means your team and other players must contribute to the corresponding planets bit by bit until each location has been liberated. \n\n\nHover over the planet to check the progress of the current Major Order. For example, the Activate the Terminid Control System quest conveys a TCS Installation Progress bar on Erata Prime, Fenrir III, Meridia, and Turing. Once those have been liberated, the Major Order will be completed. \n\n\nA previous quest requiring eight Defend Campaigns' completion also stirred up some confusion, as many players attempted to achieve it while the Major Order did not update. This is where the community-based requirements come into play again, considering that it actually means finishing eight planets with Defend Campaigns. \n\n\nHelldivers 2's Major Orders change over time, and these tasks will, of course, shift along with it. So, remember that they must be completed globally instead of the standard individual objectives. Also, ensure you claim the mission rewards, which will be sent to your account. \n\nThe post How to fix Helldivers 2 Major Order not updating appeared first on Destructoid.",

This update was in beta last month but rolls out for everyone starting today. \nThe biggest features are coming to the PS5's DualSense controller. The built-in speakers can now produce higher volume sound, which PlayStation says will allow players to hear in-game sounds and voice chat audio more clearly. Plus, the noise cancellation on the controller's built-in mic has been improved. \n\n\n\"The mic input quality on these controllers has been improved, courtesy of a new A.I. machine learning model,\" a PlayStation Blog post reads. \"Background noise from button presses and game audio are suppressed, resulting in a better voice chat experience.\"\nShare Screen is also getting some new features with today's update. Namely, viewers can move a pointer around and send a ping or draw a line on a shared screen, allowing them to highlight objects in-game or guide a player. Plus, viewers can now send emoji-based reactions to the host's screen – these features are turned off by default and the host and viewer must turn them on. PlayStation says these Share Screen features will hit the PS App, which also allows Share Screen, later this month. \nFinally, today's update allows users to adjust the brightness of the PS5 power indicator. Simply go to Settings, then Beep and Light, and then Brightness. \n\n\nFor more, read about the last big PS5 update that added Dolby Atmos, larger SSD capacity, and more to the console, and then check out this story about a retailer listing of a \"V2 DualSense\" with a 12-hour battery life.

          "description": "If you ask any Final Fantasy fan what their top five favorite songs in the franchise are, there's a 99 percent chance one of them is \"To Zanarkand\" from Final Fantasy X. However, it turns out, it wasn't originally intended for the game. \nThis news comes from Audrey (aitaikimochi on X, formerly Twitter), a mega Final Fantasy fan, Twitch streamer, and CEO of Aitai Japan Inc., who translated a recent interview between Weekly Ochiai and Final Fantasy X composer Nobuo Uematsu, whose credits also include One-Winged Angel and Aerith's Theme from Final Fantasy VII and so much more. In that interview, Uematsu revealed \"To Zanarkand\" originally began as a piece for a French flute player, meant to be played during a recital. \n\n\n\"'To Zanarkand' was actually not meant to be the theme for Final Fantasy X,\" Uematsu tells Weekly Ochiai, as translated by Audrey on X. \"There was a flute player from France who originally asked me to write a song for them to play during a recital. When I wrote the piece, I thought perhaps this sounded a bit too sad for a recital. So I set it aside for the time being. \n\"Sometime after, when I was making the score of Final Fantasy X, I was falling behind all the while the producers were hounding me. So since that flute piece was unused, I just kind of meekly handed it to them. They listened to it and said, 'Yes! This is brilliant!'\" \nIn retrospect, it's wild \"To Zanarkand\" wasn't originally composed by Uematsu for Final Fantasy X because it fits the game's themes so well, nailing the somber and sad tone present throughout Tidus and Yuna's journey in Spira. \nFor more about Final Fantasy music, read Game Informer's exclusive four-part series on composer Masayoshi Soken's score for last year's Final Fantasy XVI:\nPart 1: Creating The Prelude\nPart 2: The Victory Fanfare\nPart 3: Finding A Main Theme\nPart 4: The Sound\nAfter that, read Game Informer's review of Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster. \nWhat's your favorite Final Fantasy theme song?

This news comes from a recent notice to investors that explains board member Juergen Goeldner is taking over as interim CEO in the meantime, as reported by GameDeveloper. \nWhile Starbreeze's messaging around Sjögren's leave isn't super clear – the team simply says it is bidding farewell to the former CEO – today's news arrives after Payday 3 failed to meet expectations, according to GameDeveloper. \n\n\n\"On behalf of the board of directors, I would like to thank Tobias Sjögren for his achievements during the past three years,\" board chairman Torgny Hellström writes in the notice to investors. \"Tobias took over the helm of Starbreeze in a challenging phase of its journey and we wish him well in his future endeavors.\"\nGoeldner, the new interim CEO, adds, \"Starbreeze has a strong history of developing and publishing games globally. After launching Payday 3, the company is well-positioned to leverage the strengths of the organization to monetize and develop the IP portfolio. I am looking forward to assuming an operative position and, together with the management, ensure the execution of this strategy.\"\nGoeldner has 40 years of experience in the games industry, including several executive positions, according to the notice. His last executive position was as CEO of Focus Home Interactive. He has been a member of Starbreeze's board of directors since last year. Starbreeze has initiated a recruitment process for a permanent CEO. \n\n\nPayday 3 hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on September 21. We enjoyed the game around launch, giving it an 8 out of 10 in the Game Informer Payday 3 review.

          "description": "No matter the industry – sports, television, movies, or games – the debate of \"the greatest of all time\" inevitably comes up. These debates are often full of superfluous apples-to-oranges comparisons and, as a result, are unlikely to come up with a definitive answer everyone will be happy with. But that's what makes them so fun. In that spirit, we're taking the month of March to hold our own bracket-style tournament, voted on by readers, to determine the greatest video game of all time.\nThough we here at Game Informer assembled the bracket, even that was heavily influenced by our Reader Vote we held in 2018 to coincide with our 300th issue. Using the results of our 2018 Reader Vote combined with some input from staff, general sentiment in various online communities, and critical reception for more recent games, we assembled a starting bracket of 64 games. From here, we'll hold two rounds of voting per week until we whittle this field down to one ultimate winner.\nWill this result in a definitive selection of the best game ever released? Or will it reveal a coordinated effort from a particular gaming community committed to seeing their favorite game rise through the ranks? Only time will tell. \nWhile this is meant to be a fun experiment to see how the results shake out within the Game Informer readership and community, we hope you'll come back to root for your favorites every Monday and Thursday until we are able to crown our champion in the 2024 Game Gauntlet. Be sure to bookmark this page or follow us on social media to be alerted when a new round starts! \nRegion 1\n \n\n\n\nRegion 2\n \n\n\n\nRegion 3\n \n\n\n\nRegion 4",

          "description": "MultiVersus, the Warner Bros. free-to-play crossover platform fighter, makes its big comeback on May 28. The game has been rebuilt and returns almost a year after its open beta was taken offline.\nPlayer First Games game director Tony Huynh explains in a developer diary that MultiVersus has been remade from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5, meaning it sports improved visuals and lighting. It also has a totally revamped netcode to provide what Huynh promises will be consistent online performance regardless of platform.\nEvery existing fighter sports new attacks and combat mechanics, and Huynh promises that new fighters are on the way. Additionally, new stages were teased with concept art depicting arenas based on The Powerpuff Girls’ Townsville and Dexter’s Laboratory.\nLastly, Huynh reveals a brand-new PvE mode is coming to the game. He doesn’t go into detail, only teasing it will offer “additional ways of playing with unique rewards.” \n\n\nMultiVersus was first launched in open beta last May and pits characters across Warner Bros. stable of IPs, such as DC, Looney Tunes, and even Game of Thrones, in a tag-team-focused twist of Super Smash Bros. inspired combat. The game was initially quite popular and generally well-liked. Writer Bryan Vore gave the game’s beta incarnation an 8 out of 10 in our review, writing that “Living games have the potential to go in frustrating directions, but MultiVersus has a strong foundation. If it can meaningfully roll out content and smooth out its rough edges, this could become a new crossover obsession for years to come.” \nUnfortunately, months of infrequent updates and lack of communication following the game’s second season saw engagement decline. Player First Games pulled MultiVersus from stores to address these criticisms. When the game returns, it will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.\nAre you looking forward to jumping back into the new and improved MultiVersus?

Movie, Nintendo and Illumination have announced that work has begun on a second movie set in the world of Super Mario Bros. The announcement, made by Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto and Illumination CEO Chris Meledandri, states that this film will arrive in theaters in the United States on April 3, 2026.\nWhile the announcement stops short of calling this \"Super Mario Bros. 2\" or even referring to it as a sequel, Miyamoto confirms that Nintendo and Illumination are working together on this one, and the director duo of the first film, Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic, are returning. \"As for the details of the new movie, as I often say, we'll let you know once we're at the stage where we're ready to share more,\" Miyamoto said in the announcement video posted on Nintendo of America's YouTube channel. \"This time, we're thinking about broadening Mario's world further and it'll have a bright and fun story. We hope you'll look forward to it!\"\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie stars Chris Pratt, Anya Taylor-Joy, Charlie Day, Jack Black, Keegan-Michael Key, and Seth Rogen. Nintendo and Illumination have yet to confirm any of the cast of this new film set in the Super Mario Bros. world. The Super Mario Bros. Movie arrived in theaters on April 5, 2023 to positive fan and critic reception, and earned a place among the highest-grossing films of all time. The new film set in this same world is set to arrive almost exactly three years later on April 3, 2026.\nWhat do you want to see from a new Super Mario Bros. animated movie? Do you think it'll be another wide cast film? Or will it zero in on a specific subset of characters, like a Luigi's Mansion or Donkey Kong Country movie?",

You can read the full letter below.\nInformation ; Dear Friends and Partnershttps://t.co/85dXseckzJ pic.twitter.com/aHlx8CGA2M\nMarch 8, 2024\nAkira Toriyama was born in 1955 and became a manga artist at 23. Primarily known for his works in Weekly Shōnen Jump for works such as Dr. Slump, his biggest claim to fame would be Dragon Ball. First published in 1983, Dragon Ball would explode into a cultural phenomenon, spawning a massively popular multimedia franchise with multiple manga volumes, a successful long-running anime, several films, and a litany of merchandise. Dragon Ball has become one of the most influential mangas of all time and would also become a massive fixture in video games, with dozens of titles across a variety of platforms. \nUpcoming games based on Toryiama’s work include Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero, the next entry in the Budakai Tenkaichi series, and Sand Land, an action RPG launching on April 26 based on his 2000 manga. \nToryiama would also lend his distinct art style to video games such as the Dragon Quest series, Chrono Trigger, and Blue Dragon. Six years ago, Game Informer editors current and former got together to talk about Toriyama's influence on the game industry. You can watch that video here.\nGame Informer extends its condolences to Toriyama’s family and loved ones.",

It seems like the there's a comedic Poseidon skin on the left, and a Hades skin in the center alongside perhaps Zeus and Athena up front. There appear to be some flying Green Goblin-esque gliders at play, too, with new point-of-interest locations themed after these Greek gods and goddesses in the background.\nOnly time will tell, but fortunately, we don't have to wait too long because Fortnite Chapter 5: Season 2 – Myths & Mortals begins tomorrow, March 8. \nIn the meantime, check out the latest two Lego Islands to hit Fortnite, and then read about how Lady Gaga joined the fun last month.

          "description": "Arrowhead Game Studios has revealed in a PlayStation Blog post that Season 2 of Helldivers 2 launches next week with a new \"Cutting Edge\" Warbond. This new Warbond is packed with \"high-voltage vibes,\" giving players access to new loadout potential with ultra-futuristic armor, guns that spit lightning, stylish capes, emotes, and more. \nWarbond – Cutting Edge goes live next week on March 14 and brings with it a new \"Acquisitions\" battle pass of things to unlock. However, don't fret if you're still working through the first free and premium Warbonds in Helldivers 2 – Warbonds don't expire. \nCheck out the Helldivers 2 Warbond – Cutting Edge trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nWithin this new Warbond, players will find multiple EX Series armor prototypes. The EX-03 Prototype 3 includes a rubber underlayer for insulation with \"wires that operate at a shocking 400,000 volts.\" The EX-16 Prototype 16 has an electric arc that generates a strong magnetic field. The EX-00 Prototype X is the \"end result of several billion Super Credits and 12 years of research into creating 'the Soldier of Tomorrow.'\"\nIn terms of new weapons, expect electricity. The LAS-16 is a laser rifle that fires in short bursts, and it doesn't need reloading either (just watch for overheating). The SG-8P Punisher Plasma is a modified Punisher shotgun that uses plasma rounds, and the ARC-12 Blitzer projects an arc of close-range lightning. Or, you can charge it up to fire powerful bolts good for taking out multiple targets. \nYou can also unlock the new G-23 Stun grenade and the LAS-7 Dagger pistol, too. \n\nElsewhere in this Warbond, Helldivers will find matching player cards for each cape and three new emotes. \nCutting Edge rolls out to Destroyer Acquisition panels on March 14. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Helldivers 2 review, and then read about the latest patch that added meteor showers and fire tornadoes to the war. \nAre you excited for Warbond – Cutting Edge in Helldivers 2?

You’re charged with leading a city set within an inhospitable frozen wasteland, making decisions about how it’s governed to keep mouths fed and, hopefully, happy. That includes managing labor, politics, and even the food supply, which can ingratiate you to citizens or, worst case, cause them to revolt.  \n\n\nFrostpunk 2 will first launch on PC but will come to consoles at a later date (including Xbox Game Pass).

It is an action game based in and inspired by historical Japan, but that was about all we knew. Today, Capcom showed a lot more gameplay and offered some additional insight into the single player game. Plus it detailed more of exactly what the game is on its Xbox Wire page.\nThe action is defined as \"dancing swords,\" but you will also be making decisions about what villagers you will take with you on your journey, leading to some strategic elements. You will apparently be making preparations for battle during the day to protect your Maiden and the village before the night, which is when battle takes place.\n\n\nCapcom and Microsoft do not have a release date for the game yet, but it is apparently coming this year and will be included with Game Pass subscriptions.",

After a quick but seemingly successful open beta period on the platform, the company has revealed Final Fantasy XIV will fully launch on Xbox Series X/S on March 21. \nThis news was revealed during the Xbox Partner Preview, with a reminder that players can partake in the open beta right now. Square Enix also revealed that the starter edition of the game, which includes the base campaign A Realm Reborn and the Heavensward and Stormblood expansions, will be available through Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. However, you must claim it as a perk between March 21 and April 19. \n\n\nThe timing of the Xbox Series X/S launch for Final Fantasy XIV comes at a great time as the game's next expansion, Dawntrail, is set to launch this summer. Here's a breakdown of everything you need to know about Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail. \nBefore Dawntrail, though, you'll need to play up through the latest expansion, Endwalker, to be fully caught up on the entire story. Getting caught up should be a lot of fun, though, and you'll get to find out why Final Fantasy XIV is ranked so high on Game Informer's ranking of every mainline Final Fantasy game. \nAre you going to play Final Fantasy XIV on Xbox later this month?

A joint motion for a $2.4m judgment in favor of Nintendo was filed on Monday.

          "description": "For the 17th time, ScummVM has again been accepted for the Google Summer of Code program this summer.\nThe program intends to bring new contributors into open source projects. In the most recent two years this has included both students and non-students as eligible candidates for participation.\nLike last year, participants can apply for working on either short tasks (about 175 hours of work), or large tasks (about 350 hours of work). The coding period typically runs from start of June through August, but there is some flexibility which allows participants to have longer time frames if they are unable to work full time through the summer.\nScummVM is looking for people interested in participating in GSoC with us. A list of suggested projects can be found on this page, but we are also open to your own ideas as well. Please provide the required information in your application before submitting.\nWe also strongly encourage you to join our Discord server, in the #scummvm-gsoc channel. This allows you to engage with our mentors and the rest of the team, to get advice about how to get involved with the project, as well as writing your application.\nBased on our previous 16 years of experience with GSoC, we have put together a Google Summer of Code miniportal to help you get started.\nLooking forward to hearing from you!\n>",

Exactly 21 years ago, I received an ICQ message (look it up, kids) out of the blue from a guy named Ludvig Strigeus (nicknamed Ludde). “Hello, you probably don’t know me, but I’ve been working on a project to clone TTD for a while.” he said, more or less. He didn’t want to release this to the public yet, and wasn’t entirely sure what he was going to do with it. (He’d been working on it since 30th June 2002, so I guess that is technically the birthday of what would become OpenTTD…) Ludde sent me a copy of what he’d been working on, and it was very exciting indeed. It was a fully functional version of Transport Tycoon Deluxe, written in C. Admittedly incomplete at that time, it was still quite remarkable.",
