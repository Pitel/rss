Well, another is set to join the scarcely-discussed collection this week, as The Samurai Collection (QUByte Classics) comes to Switch on 3rd November, 2022.\nThe collection brings together two beat 'em ups from the 1990s: First Samurai and Second Samurai.

It's not just the number of supports Blizzard have been thinking about either. Over the weekend, it also emerged the Overwatch 2 devs are sending out a survey to current players, with emphasis on the game’s store and the divisive battle pass introduced when the series went free to play. The developments follow on from hero balance changes being brought forward from season two to mid-November.\r\n\n \nRead more",

So what are we to do to make this occasion still feel special?\nI know common wisdom considers Halloween to be \"Goth Christmas\", but in my experience goths bloody love Christmas as much as the next person. They are, however, far more likely to be agnostic on the subject of Valentine's Day.

That’s basically body horror.\nApparently ignorant of their products’ ability to frighten and maim, PC gaming hardware makers sometimes try to manufacture an imposing aura by giving them big, bad names. You’ve probably seen these already: keyboards named after swords, laptops christened as mythical animals and the like. But some go full spooky, consulting the Halloween kids’ costume pantheon of creatures and creepers.

Too late now! Plus, witches are totally Halloween fodder - and they're one of my key trends for games at the moment. Video games are lousy with both current and upcoming witches these days.\nIt makes sense. They've already got brilliant marketing. Few Halloween-y sights are more iconic than a pointy hat, a black cat, and a sihouetted figure flying in front of the moon on a broomstick. The witches I've collected here are definitely going to get you in the pumpkin spirit, even if they manage to run through most other genres except horror... Look, Halloween is mostly about sweets and dressing up these days anyway (and by the way, I am livid that I've not got any parties to go to this year, because my hair is exactly the right length to do a perfect Carmy Berzatto costume).\nRead more",

          "description": "The original Butterfly Soup is named for its ending monologue. Its four main characters, Diya, Min-seo, Noelle, and Akarsha, use the liquefaction of a caterpillar inside a cocoon as a metaphor for the awkward teenage growing phase they’re all in. In the sequel, set a few months later, they find a butterfly with a crumpled wing. It’s a victim of a false spring, having emerged from its cocoon too early due to unseasonably warm weather. One of them worries that they are like the injured insect; forever marked by their early life. And it’s this that Butterfly Soup 2 digs into much more deeply than its predecessor.\nIf you’re not familiar with the original, Butterfly Soup is a visual novel about four Asian girls navigating high school in the late 2000s, playing baseball, and falling in love. On replaying it to get ready for this review, it made me cry at least twice and laugh out loud a bunch more. It’s pay what you want with no minimum price, and takes about 2-3 hours. I’m also going to spoil parts of it, so go play it already.\nRead more",

          "description": "Stress Level Zero's Boneworks was Half-life: Alyx before Half-Life: Alyx released. Released in December 2019, its combination of deeply tactile interactions with a campaign heavily inspired by Half-Life 2 represented a major step forward for VR experiences at the time. It had a fair few rough edges, and you needed a cast-iron stomach to play it, but for about four months it was the ambitious, all-encompassing VR experience that the medium had hitherto lacked.\nThen Half-Life: Alyx came around, raising the (crow)bar so high that you'd need to be Mr Fantastic or some sort of bird with hands to reach it. Which is partly why Bonelab, the newly released sequel to Boneworks, hasn't quite gelled with me in the way its older sibling did. Technologically, its still very impressive, and noodling around with its massive interactive potential remains undeniably fun. But it often feels like a lot of good ideas with too little connective tissue between them. It's also even less compromising on your physiology than Boneworks was, seemingly determined to make existing in VR as uncomfortable as possible.\nRead more",

My first thought as I crouched behind a nearby rock and surveyed its chromium splendour was: \"I am definitely not yet ready to fight this thing.\"\nMy second thought came quickly after the first, when my cover was blown by a nearby Watcher that immediately reared back and emitted a shrill noise that alerted the Thunderjaw to my presence. \"Oh shite.

It is a complicated, huge, and ponderous alien invasion simulator that constantly threatens to drop the other boot on you the entire time. Anything you do could be the butterfly whose little wingflaps eventually result in the obliteration of the planet. It is not a game to be powered through, but to be played and contemplated exclusively for a solid month.\nThat is its central weakness. But I think it had to be this way. Its commitment to an idea is demanding, but if you can tolerate some issues with clarity and presentation, the payoff for meeting it is utterly unique.\nRead more",

Any time in the past couple of weeks that my friends and colleagues thought they were talking to me, they were in fact talking to an exquisite Italian neon-folk horror game wearing my skin and looking out of the eye-holes in my skull. On at least one occasion I lay in bed at 3am, sweaty and frozen in half-asleep fear, because I thought I'd heard a strange rattling noise...\nIn fact it was not stillness, but the panic-sprint into darkness that became my main and oft-unsuccessful tactic whenever I heard the creature of Gravoi. Gravoi itself is a small but inconveniently maze-like fictional Sardinian town, host to a yearly folk festival that, every so often, involves the unwary being carried off and killed by a... something. Unfortunately, four very unwary outsiders - rendered outsiders for a variety of reasons, whether they're locals or not - find themselves having to survive the night of this festival, armed with things like matches, firecrackers and a polaroid camera.\nRead more",

Our froggy pal has saved a haunted island from the clutches of ghosts, thwarted wizardous party-poopers in Warlock Woods, and now their investigatory prowess has taken him to the wild west. Frog Detective 3: Corruption At Cowboy County may be the last in Worm Club's trio of Frog Detective games, but it's also a certified banger, successfully joining the first and second games in putting a stupid smile on my face for the entire time I played.\nRead more",

          "description": "38-inch gaming ultrawides are few and far between, and it's particularly rare to find good deals on them - so that's why I was excited to see this Dell Alienware AW3821DW on sale with a code from HUKD. When you use code HUKDAW3821DW, this monitor drops from £1299 to £899, an incredible value for a monitor of this spec. \nLet's quickly run through those specs. This 38-in monitor has a resolution of 3840x1600, essentially a shorter version of 4K, with a 144Hz refresh rate. The monitor is Nvidia G-Sync Ultimate certified, meaning it has a physical G-Sync module to prevent judder and tearing, and it also gets bright enough to earn the lofty DisplayHDR 600 rating. All in all, it's a ton of monitor for a fairly reasonable price. \nRead more",

As familiar as one can get, anyway, with a monster list of 30-plus display and graphics settings, not even counting all the granular DLSS and FSR options for compatible graphics cards. \nAfter Lord-knows-how-many breachings and clearings of the same damn oil rig, I believe I’ve cracked these options and found the best settings combination to balance nu-MW2’s sharp visuals with smooth, steady performance. The latter can be a big ask of older, weaker PC hardware,  despite some innocuous system requirements, but with the right tweaks it’s easy to get at least a solid 60fps on most modern GPUs and CPUs.\nRead more",

Yet they can be poignant, dramatic reminders of friends and family that meant a lot to characters too, depending on who the shambling corpse used to be. If I was going to hire any enemy for a game, I’d hire a zombie. Then they’d eat my brain. That’s why I hired them!

Instead I played RTS games as though they were city-builders, with the added bonus of absolutely steamrolling through the AI when I'd had enough fun.\nThis was true of basically every RTS I played back then. In Starcraft I'd amass an army of Protoss Carriers and launch them across the map. In Supreme Commander, I'd tech all the way up to the Experimental Weapons, and then send the colossal CZAR Mothership to Independence-Day the entire enemy base. But my favourite variation of this was in Impossible Creatures: a wonderful early noughties strategy game where you create your own units by stitching together parts from different animals.\n Read more",

          "description": "AMD's Ryzen 7000 processors are brilliant, often beating Intel 12th-gen offerings and drawing close with 13th-gen, while offering support for PCIe 5.0 SSDs, DDR5 RAM and a brand new AM5 socket. For content creation, they're by far the best CPUs AMD has ever produced - but for gaming, there is another option: the Ryzen 7 5800X3D. This CPU remains stunningly fast in some games that can take advantage of its uniquely huge L3 cache, and best of all works with a wide range of inexpensive AM4 motherboards with cheap DDR4 RAM. \nPound for pound, it's by far the best AMD CPU for gaming on the market - and now it's been reduced to just $329 at Antonline via Ebay. That's a healthy $120 reduction from its US MSRP of $449, and a great price overall given the level of gaming performance it provides. \nRead more",

Whenever I load them up, I just can’t help but pause every five seconds for a breather. Multiplayer games are far more manageable, though, and often also turn stifled screams into contagious laughter as your friends terrorise each other.\nIf you’re a scaredy cat like me and would rather scream at the horrors of your unhinged mates than at unpredictable AIs and scripted jump scares, then you’re in the right spot. Here are five games in which your mates can play as the monster. Some are creepy, some are cute, and none of them will force you to run around alone. If you're looking to get monstrous yourself this Halloween, Liam's done a list all about games that make you the monster. No overlap, promise.\nRead more",

This was upsetting to me; this may come as a surprise, but I try to avoid playing and reviewing games I think I won't like. I don't want to go out of my way to be mean, and I also don't want to spend hours not enjoying myself. I go into almost every game I play actively wanting to enjoy it (the exception being things like Succubus, which I can only assume are trying an avant garde technique to plumb new, unexplored depths of badness on purpose).\nAs it turned out, a lot of other reviewers did like it. I'm not going to object to that, because it takes all sorts to make a world, and so on. Rather, it made me wonder if I'd sort of hallucinated how much I liked the first Tales From The Borderlands. How fantastic it was, managing to be both the best Telltale game and the best Borderlands game in one, was a big part of why I was so excited for New Tales. It came out a long time ago, and I hadn't played it for a while. Maybe it wasn't how I remembered. Maybe I'd changed, you know?\nRead more",

It's like, it's a wheelbarrow. I know what that does!”\r\n\n\r\nTo Isgreen, it’s this level of accessibility that’s carried Age Of Empires all the way to today’s 25th anniversary. The instantly legible historical warfare  -  “pikemen, ranged units and cavalry” - paired with randomised maps that promised, effectively, an infinite amount of replayability; “It just had a lot of features that I think players really loved and kind of defined itself along those features in a way that, yeah, it's just outlasted everything else.”\r\n\n \nRead more",

I was all geared up for some science fiction-tinged Spice Girls shenanigans, but I was left bitterly disappointed. However, I’d already installed it, so I decided to check it out and see what kind of game it actually is. Turns out that Victoria 3 is a grand strategy game, just like its Paradox stablemates Crusader Kings and Hearts of Iron.\nTrying to classify Victoria 3 is pretty damn important. Unlike, say, the Total War series, Paradox’s grand strategy titles are differentiated by a lot more than their time periods. Hearts of Iron its WW2 military ticker on its sleeve, while Crusader Kings (my personal fave) is secretly an RPG, just one that happens to cast you as the ruler of a country, rather than a random wandering murderer. Figure that out and you grasped the appeal of the game, especially for people who may lack interest in - or be downright put off by - the historical era it covers.\nRead more",

          "description": "Horror games are great and all that, but what about games that make you the monster? Yeah. Chew on that for a second.\r\n\nI'm not just talking about games that belong to the horror genre, either. In fact, spare those asymmetrical multiplayer games that are all the rage with their worryingly young audiences, there are few actual horror games that let you assume the role of the villain. But that doesn't mean there isn't a deluge of titles where you play as a creature so vile, so menacing, that the residents of their worlds undoubtly view the player as evil incarnate. Far from it. The games on this list may not all be spooky in tone, but your character is still the stuff of actual nightmares.\nRead more",

As reported by Tech News Space, it appears that Robert Kurvitz, the lead developer and writer on Disco Elysium, is suing Studio ZA/UM, the development studio of Disco Elysium, via his own company Telomer. Kotaku AU seem to have corroborated this, finding a record on the Estonian Ministry of Justice's website showing Telomer has filed an application against ZA/UM Studio to \"obtain information and review documents\", which you can see for yourself here.\nThis comes after Martin Luiga announced (in a frankly kinda weird post) the dissolution of The ZA/UM Cultural Association, and that Kurvitz, writer Helen Hindpere, and art director Aleksander Rostov were no longer working at Studio ZA/UM.\r\n \nRead more",

Not because we're die-hard horror buffs - if anything, we're both lifelong wimps when it comes to this stuff. But buoyed by a growing resolve to tackle our collective cowardice head on, October has seen us watch, play and read several of the big horror classics we've been too chicken to attempt in the past. Over the course of it all, though, there's been a gnawing, slightly dreadful realisation slowly bubbling away beneath the surface. Far from being scared by these horrible things, I've often come away feeling no emotions whatsoever. I have remained unmoved, neither frightened, unnerved, or creeped out. Just plain, simple indifference. The Japanese Ring? Nothing. I Saw The Devil? Nah, mate. Lake Mungo? More like Lake Yawngo.\nI was beginning to think I'd lost the capacity to feel anything at all. Heck, the real horror show this month has been the collapse of the entire UK nation state, and yet I still cannot bring myself to muster anything beyond a tired sigh. Then I got to the second act of Resident Evil Village's Shadows Of Rose DLC and, oh yes, hello fear. It's been a while, hasn't it?\nRead more",

Další možností je použité Pantone barvy ručně definovat nebo jejich definice zkopírovat ze starších verzí (Dovoluje to licence?), viz video na YouTube.

          "description": "An adventure classic is being remade from the ground up\nCyan is remaking another one of its classics, this time in Riven. The studio has announced it is developing a Riven remake from the ground up.\nRiven, or Riven: The Sequel to Myst, will be getting a full, modern remake. Cyan's already produced a remake for Myst, and it seems like this will be a similar undertaking.\nIn an FAQ online, Cyan addresses the basics. Yes, this is a remake from the ground up, not a remaster. The new Riven remake will also be fully traversable in 3D.\nNo details on platforms or dates have been announced yet. But this will be a new game, so expect to buy a new product, rather than get it for free if you already have the classic Riven.\nAs to why Cyan is doing this now, and after 25 years? Here's their explanation:\n\"Riven is one of the most highly regarded games in Cyan’s history. We didn’t want to approach it lightly or frivolously. Cyan is a small indie studio. We wanted to make sure we could take on such a difficult, costly and complicated endeavor – and do it well.\"\n\nhttps://twitter.com/cyanworlds/status/1587065601339424770\nRemaking the sequel to Myst\nThere was also a fan project in the works, the Starry Expanse Project, to remake Riven. Alongside news of the remake, Cyan confirms that project has been ceased development. The Starry Expanse team continues to exist, independent from Cyan, though the two teams collaborated early on to kickstart the official remake development, according to Cyan's letter. One member of the Starry Expanse team has also been hired by Cyan.\n\"So for the first time publicly, we are happy to report that our effort to remake Riven officially here at Cyan is alive and well, and it was helped by the Starry Expanse team’s years of effort, enabling us to begin the huge task of rebuilding Riven from scratch,\" said Cyan. \"With a very focused development team here at Cyan, Riven is well on its way to being reborn!\"\nThe post Riven, the sequel to Myst, is getting a remake appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The deal kicks off with the upcoming Iron Man game\nEA and Marvel have locked in a deal for at least three action-adventure games. Electronic Arts will develop the titles, set in the Marvel universe, for PC and console.\nThe deal was first reported today by Bloomberg, followed by an announcement from EA. Marvel and Electronic Arts will collaborate on \"at least three\" new action-adventure games, available for PC and console.\nThese games will be original stories set in the Marvel universe, and we already know about one of them. EA Motive was recently confirmed to be working on an Iron Man game.\n\"At Marvel, we strive to find best-in-class teams who can take our characters on heroic journeys in ways they haven’t before, and collaborating with Electronic Arts will help us achieve that,\" said Marvel Games executive VP Jay Ong. \"We pride ourselves on being enthusiastic, creative collaborators with developers so they have the freedom to create something deeply unique and truly remarkable. The team at Motive is getting started on that with their Iron Man video game and we can’t wait for players to learn more in the far future.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GLbwkfhYZk\nA Marvel-ous deal\nEA has a history with the Star Wars series already. Games like Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order have done pretty well. Well enough, in fact, that Respawn's working on several more Star Wars projects.\nWith a Marvel deal locked in, it looks like Electronic Arts is deepening its ties to Disney properties.\nThe Marvel universe isn't just stopping there, though. Skydance recently teased its upcoming Captain America-Black Panther project. (Skydance is also working on a Star Wars project.)\nPlus, Marvel's Midnight Suns is just around the corner in December. And Marvel Snap is gradually taking over everyone's phones. The Marvel games roll-out just keeps growing.\nThe post EA locks in a deal with Marvel for at least three games appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "$5 straight cash compared to 700 Overwatch bux\nYikes! That's just about the only thing that can sum up a lot of Overwatch 2 news post-launch, but this Overwatch 2 charm situation is so funny it has to be shared.\nOver on the Overwatch Reddit, user hi_im_redbeard shared an anecdote that showcased how out of control the monetization scheme is in Overwatch 2. In short, they purchased a real life Pachimari keychain/charm that they can hold in their hand for cheaper than it costs to buy the same Overwatch 2 charm in-game. Showing their work, the Pachimari charm (literally just an in-game side item, almost NFT-like in nature) is 700 Overwatch Coins, which is more than $5 (which converts to 500 Coins). Yep, you have to do the standard scummy \"buy more than you need\" conversion here, so it's even more expensive than roughly $7 if you need to top up.\nThere are plenty of economic nuances afoot, and this wouldn't be the first time something like this happened; as some games (Pokemon Unite included) can put out insanely high-priced limited-run skins that are more expensive than an action figure of the character in question. But this particular incident showcases how Overwatch 2, in its move to \"free-to-play\" (and erasing the original premium game) has shoved in even more ways to monetize its audience with new cosmetics.\nWhen some fans are asking to bring loot boxes back, you know you have a monetization problem. It'll be interesting to see just how much content Overwatch 2 gets over time, how it's even further monetized, and what the PVE element brings to the table (more monetization?).\nThe post Hilariously, someone pointed out that it’s cheaper to buy this Overwatch 2 charm in real life compared to the game appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Audacity\nWizards of the Coast has provided us with another exclusive Magic Arena card (that's also coming to paper Magic of course): Audacity. It's set to debut in the The Brothers' War set, which is out on November 11 via pre-release, November 15 in Arena, and November 18 in paper Magic.\nAs a reminder, here's a quick rundown of the lore for the release, to set the mood:\n\"Through nefarious means, the evil Phyrexians establish a foothold on Dominaria. They secretly transform ordinary citizens into deadly sleeper agents who go about their lives, ignorant of their new purpose. As word of the Phyrexian incursion spreads, the people of Dominaria attempt to band together as the sleeper agents threaten to tear them apart.\"\n\nThe Brothers' War is going to have all sorts of lore implications, and follows the Dominaria United set that arrived back in September. From here, we'll be delving even further into the story of the Phyrexians, with Phyrexia: All Will Be One, slated for January 2023. It's a pretty busy block for Magic, as the Dominaria storyline/setting once again is hitting it pretty big with the community.\nDestructoid's exclusive Magic Arena card: Audacity\n\nAs for the card itself, it's an enchantment aura called Audacity that costs 1G, enchants a creature, and provides a +2/+0 and trample bonus. When Audacity is put into the graveyard from the battlefield, you draw a card.\nThis is the sort of thing you wouldn't mind drawing in most Magic formats, limited included. A low cost always ensures that it's generally playable (or very playable), and although it's not a flash/instant-speed enchantment. Plus, the art from Rudy Siswanto is killer and wonderfully showcases the direct conflict from the lore.\nAs usual, I can't wait to pick one up and put it in a toploader!\nThe post Exclusive: Here’s a look at a new The Brothers’ War card coming to paper Magic and Magic Arena appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Producer Cory Barlog shared his frustration\nA situation that led to God of War Ragnarok being leaked has led to a full confirmation of said leak from the game's producer (Cory Barlog), a bit of venting, and a public warning.\nAs Barlog points out, a retailer has broken street date and sold God of War Ragnarok roughly two weeks before the November 9 release date; leading to posts online about the game, including screens, and down the line, potentially spoiler-related content. Consider this your warning!\nHere's a full recap of Barlog's sentiments on Twitter over the weekend:\n\"You know, right now, I can really understand the benefit of having just an installer on the physical disc. Smh. A retailer selling the game nearly TWO WEEKS before release. just so disappointing. Sorry to everyone that you have to dodge the spoilers if you want to play the game fresh. completely fucking stupid you have to do this. this is not at all how any of us at SMS wanted things to go. To be clear, I was expressing my frustration in the first tweet. not advocating for that at all. Not the future i want as a gamer or dev. just so beyond frustrated. Feel terrible for the team. This whole ordeal is incredibly stressful for us all. Mental health break time.\"\n\nOn the bright side, for Sony, God of War as a whole is a pretty impenetrable franchise that people will buy regardless. By that same token, it's also so massive that a leak was almost inevitable: though several weeks early is not really the norm in many cases.\nThe big takeaway for everyone: be careful if you want to avoid spoilers!\nThe post Warning, God of War Ragnarok leaked early, so watch out for spoilers appeared first on Destructoid.",

That's three decades of demon summoning, spinoffs, and success wrapped up in one tweet, with a few classic demons worked into the logo (like Jack Frost, Pyro Jack, and Pixie) to boot.\nAs Atlus points out, the series began in Japan on October 30, 1992: a sufficiently spooky release window, inline with the dark themes that the series typically plays with. Now it's celebrating three decades in existence, with spinoffs that have spinoffs. The staying power of the SMT name is pretty awe-inspiring.\nRecent Shin Megami Tensei happenings\nAs the Shin Megami Tensei art tweet shows the series as a whole is still going strong, having just launched Soul Hackers 2 this year, and Shin Megami Tensei V in 2021. The Persona umbrella is also enjoying a huge resplendent re-release era on multiple platforms, and arguably the best core SMT game, Nocturne, was remastered recently.

          "description": "Welcome (back) to the jungle\nA new recruitment video from studio Virtuos has sparked internet whispers that the global game developer has started work on a new Metal Gear Solid project. The rumors circulated this weekend after \"clues\" were spotted in the presentation, which was designed to spotlight the studio's Montreal team.\nWhile speaking with one of Virtuos' key concepts artists, Louis-Alex Boismenu, the hefty (and highly recommended) tome \"The Art of Metal Gear Solid\" is placed tantalizingly in shot, with the book seemingly being used to prop up Boismenu's desk lamp. This might seem to be \"reaching\" on the fans' part, but it is rare that videos such as these would include such an odd detail. You'd think the book would be cleared aside during shot-blocking. I would have done so and I'm basically Kubrick.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWjDzBrmveo&t=73s\nLending further weight to this theory are rumors, sourced by VGC back in 2021, that Virtuos might have been handed the contract to develop a remake of 2004 adventure Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. This still unconfirmed rumor, coupled with some recent recruitment adverts and the aforementioned video, has led fans to believe that the studio is working on something Metal Gear Solid-related. However, who knows quite what is on the books or when the truth will out, remains a mystery.\nAll that said, it must be noted that sometimes a lamp prop is just a lamp prop...

Long live Geralt of Rivia\nIf you've been on social media at all in the past few days or managed to make it through the entirety of Black Adam, you've probably heard that Henry Cavill is once again suiting up as the Man of Steel. Whether or not his return to the DC Extended Universe will finally help Warner Bros. get that disaster train back on track remains to be seen. What we do know is that Cavill will be walking away from the role that's kept him busy in the years since he had to have his mustache digitally removed in post-production. It was announced today that Cavill is stepping down as Geralt of Rivia in the hit Netflix adaptation of The Witcher.\nhttps://twitter.com/witchernetflix/status/1586433840318648321\nAs you can see in the tweet above, Cavill will be replaced in season 4 by Robert California Liam Hemsworth. The second-tier Hemsworth is probably best known for his role as Gale Hawthrone in the Hunger Games films and, like many of his fellow Aussies, a brief stint on the soap opera Neighbours. He also did a show for Quibi. Raise your hand if you remember Quibi.\nWhile Cavill is leaving the Netflix series behind, fans will still be able to see him as Geralt when The Witcher's third season debuts sometime next year. If you're like me and just subscribed to Netflix for the first time in six years a few days ago, know there is a lot of Witcher content to consume on the streamer, including the animated film The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf and The Witcher: Blood Origin, a prequel series that'll debut in December (fingers crossed it's better than that dreary House of the Dragon). In addition to all that, a second animated film has also been commissioned and there is apparently a family-friendly spin-off in the works.\nThe post Henry Cavill is flying up up and away from the fourth season of The Witcher appeared first on Destructoid.",

We're just days away from the launches of Square-Enix's Harvestella and Doraemon Story of Seasons: Friends of the Great Kingdom, while Disney Dreamlight Valley is proving popular enough for people looking to get their farming fix with a heaping dose of Disney magic. Plenty of stuff to enjoy right now, but it's a game that's launching next year that has me more excited than anything else. Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life remake heads our way in a matter of months. Initially revealed for the Nintendo Switch, Xseed Games confirmed this week the A Wonderful Life remake will launch on all modern platforms simultaneously in North America.\nSet in the tranquil Forgotten Valley, A Wonderful Life tasks players with building up a farm and seeing it through to the end of their character's life. Life with other games in the series, players can get married and start a family, but your decisions will determine if your kid carries on the family tradition of running the farm or setting off to discover their own path in life. As has already been confirmed, all marriage candidates can be romanced no matter your farmer's chosen gender, and players can make their farmer non-binary.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IkVCpBG89I\nThe Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life remake will release on Nintendo Switch, PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S next summer. As a reminder, Xseed Games is also releasing a remastered edition of Rune Factory 3, titled Rune Factory 3 Special, in 2023.

The ultimate goal for this project is to generate more active users than any other games they've made thus far.\n\"One key to achieving this goal is whether we can draw together a large community, involving not only players but also streamers who stream the game and viewers who watch their videos,\" said Satomi in the filing. \"That kind of community expands and further develops game content, adding value to the game that is unimagined by developers, and sparking a broader movement—which can then draw in even more users and grow the game’s presence dramatically.\"\nThere have been some rumors about what the super game project might entail, but we've still yet to get a firm idea.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XET9s-9PLas\nA new frontier\nWe do know that this super game isn't Sonic Frontiers, which is set to launch in November. Sega also has a few other games in store between now and 2026, like the recently revealed Like a Dragon: Ishin.\nThere's more in the works for Sega's older IP, too. In the filing today, the company specifically cites \"dormant\" IP. The company will continue to develop these by \"means of remakes, remastering, and reboots,\" so it sounds like more old Sega hits could see the limelight.\nThe post Sega aims to create ‘super game’ by March 2026 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Dragonflight is out on November 28\nThe time has come for the World of Warcraft pre-Dragonflight expansion patch, much to the delight of lapsed players everywhere. Let's talk about the broad strokes before the actual expansion launches on November 28.\nHere's a quick rundown of the pre-Dragonflight expansion patch:\nThe talent system has been revamped, and here's the biggest change: \"Change your talents anywhere, for free. Switching talents no longer requires being in a rested area or using tomes. However, you can’t change talents during combat, Mythic+ runs, and active PvP matches.\"\nYou can play Mage, Priest, and Rogue classes with all races\nFull UI/HUD customization is in, by default, without the help of mods\nSeason 4 ends this week, with a \"post-season\" lull until the expansion arrives\nAfter all this, the \"second phase\" of the pre-expansion patch will launch on November 15. At that point the Evoker class will be available, as well as a new zone (Forbidden Reach), the Uldaman: Legacy of Tyr dungeon (just in time for the new God of War), and the typical pre-expansion in-game events.\nShadowlands, the current WoW expansion, had a number of things working against it. A lot of the playerbase was fed up with WoW, fed up with Activision-Blizzard (especially when all this came out)...and of course, it was also at a time when Final Fantasy XIV was really, really good. Maybe Dragonflight can turn things around, leading into the Microsoft aqusition. Or maybe not. With modern Blizzard, you never know what's going to happen.\nIf you want to dig further, you can find the full patch notes here.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXefWvv4-LE\nThe post World of Warcraft just got its massive pre-Dragonflight expansion patch appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Doctor Shmup\nIf you fancy something a lil' cute 'n' weird for your retro fix this week, then you're in luck, as Hamster has reached into the Namco back catalog and pulled out one of the developer's few horizontally scrolling shmups, the totes adorbs Ordyne, now available on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.\nReleased to Japanese arcades in 1988 and capitalizing on the high-color, high-goofball attraction of Konami's Parodius, Ordyne sees a highly intelligent professor, Dr. Tomari, take to the skies in order to rescue his kidnapped sweetheart Kana, who has been abducted by his rival, Dr. Kubata. Accompanying the good Doctor on his quest is loyal sidekick Sunday Chin. SUNDAY CHIN. What follows is action exceptionally similar to Gradius/Parodius, with familiar enemy patterns, pacing, and power-ups. Still, the Konami titles are sound examples of the genre, and thus, so is Ordyne.\nCheck out the colorful action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber Were1974.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHIWgljPGQ\nAs they battle through each stage, Tomari and Chin can gather crystals mid-flight, to be spent at a series of anti-gravity stores, run by a typical doe-eyed anime gal. Much like Sega's Fantasy Zone, our heroes can then purchase speed boosts, extra lives, shields, and many other items in order to give the duo the edge in battle. Oddly, the weapons are time-limited, meaning that you'll only maintain that edge for so long before returning to your default form. What kinda shop offers that service?\nOrdyne would eventually receive a port on the PC Engine — a form that would eventually see the game head west for the first time ever. It hasn't featured on all that many Namco compilations over the years, so remains something of an oddity even today. If you'd like to get your wings on in on a bright-eyed rescue mission, then Ordyne is available to download now on PS4 and Switch, priced at around $8.\nThe post Cutesy Namco shmup Ordyne takes flight on Arcade Archives appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "This NSFW cat-themed roguelike is \"hopefully\" coming in 2024\nThe Binding of Isaac is renowned as one of the most influential indie games of all time, and I personally believe it helped usher in the wave of awesome roguelikes that have come out in its wake. The game was created by a teeny tiny team, but the whole project was the brainchild of Edmund McMillen, who also created Super Meat Boy, another indie classic. His new game, Mewgenics, has been in the works for over a decade now, but for the first time in years, we finally have an update on the title -- or more specifically, an actual release window.\nMewgenics is a \"turn-based legacy roguelike draft sim about cats,\" according to the game's Steam page, and will allow players to \"hoard, breed, train, and set cats out on epic adventures through a sprawling world of complete chaos.\" The release window is currently listed as \"sometime in 2024 (hopefully),\" and while that's a while to wait, it's just nice to know that the game is still coming out at all. It also looks like it's going to have the same dark, twisted sense of humor that McMillen is known for. I mean, just look at this gif he posted as the announcement of the Steam page going live:\nhttps://twitter.com/edmundmcmillen/status/1586047233715101696\nOther features of the game listed on the Steam page include \"100s of hours of gameplay,\" \"6+ classes, each with 50+ unique abilities to draft from,\" \"200+ enemies and bosses that will upset your mom,\" and many more. We already know that McMillen has an eye for some of the most engaging gameplay out there, and Mewgenics looks like it's shaping up to be his most complex project yet. I know I'm pumped to give it a try when it drops eventually, and it'll be interesting to see how the creator's design sensibilities have evolved over time.\nThe post Mewgenics, the new game from the Binding of Isaac creator, has a release window appeared first on Destructoid.",

The game featured are Neo Geo shmup Andro Dunos (1992); futuristic sports game Flip Shot (1997) and its sequel Bang Bead (2000); side-scrolling actioner Ganryu (1999); rally racer Neo Drift Out (1996), soccer title Goal!

The lo-fi survival adventure is currently in development for PC at indie outfit Sutemi Productions. A release date was not revealed.\nIn My Work is Not Yet Done, players will take control of Avery, the last surviving member of an investigative who trekked deep into strange and uncharted country to source a mysterious radio transmission. A brain-heavy piece, the new title will combine investigative and analytical mystery alongside the simulation of surviving as a single person in a changing, isolated, and deeply unnerving environment.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC0fSDi5b4g\nAs Avery, players will be tasked with continuing the work of her departed investigative team, staying one step ahead of death and insanity while uncovering the clues that will lead to an almost indecipherable phenomenon. From the official blurb, My Work is Not Yet Done appears doom-laden, suggesting that the team's — Avery's — task may be unfinishable, as each and every day brings with it further mystery, more questions than answers, and the smothering cloud of both isolation and mortal fear. Heavy stuff.\nRegardless, with its creepy, staccato imagery, immersive atmosphere, and non-linear approach to adventure, Sutemi's new release might prove to be a real sleeper hit for those who like their horror a little on the cerebral side.

But if you asked Platinum dev and executive Hideki Kamiya, he'd urge you to play the initial two games first. The latter is mostly true: if you can play the first two, you'll get a lot out of it. If you play Bayonetta 3 first you'll mostly be fine, but there are bits and pieces from the original two games that will greatly benefit your enjoyment of the story, and certain character interactions.\nMinor vague spoilers below in terms of themes, but nothing specific\nIn Bayonetta 3, the titular protagonist and her team are squaring off against a new threat: …",

          "description": "\"We apologize that we could not meet demand\"\nBayonetta 1 Switch shortages for the newly minted physical editions are sadly plaguing the UK and some regions in Europe, thanks to an exclusive rollout on the My Nintendo Store.\nHere's the full statement from Nintendo, on Twitter, issued today:\n\"We apologize that we could not meet demand for the physical edition of the first Bayonetta game recently. We will restock the physical edition of the first Bayonetta game once more later this year, on [the] My Nintendo Store.\"\n\nThe tweet then goes on to provide a link for update registration here.\nMeanwhile, in the US, Bayonetta 1 has been available at several retailers, and is readily in stock at the time of writing at Best Buy. It actually went up for sale weeks ago (I got my copy a while back), and is holding stock. So the \"limited quantities\" Nintendo spoke of in the past seem to be region-based.\nOutside of the regional Bayonetta 1 Switch shortages, this isn't the first hectic rodeo from a My Nintendo Store rollout. Xenoblade 3 was rife with access problems, with virtual queues that didn't work, or crashed randomly. Ideally Nintendo will stop doing exclusives like this in any region, as the demand clearly exceeds whatever Nintendo has in mind in terms of a sustainable approach to taking pre-orders.\nIn the meantime, if you really want it and don't want to wait on a mystery restock window (or potentially deal with a broken website again), importing from the US could be an option. Secondhand markets aren't selling it at obscene prices just yet, and some stores might ship overseas.\nThe post Nintendo UK apologizes for Bayonetta 1 Switch shortages, says more are coming this year appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Breakin'.. And you just don't stop...\nIt's been a long, long, long time coming, but fight fans finally have a release date for QuByte Interactive's long-awaited two-hander Breakers Collection — The compendium of old-school-cool fighting titles will finally launch January 12 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.\nBreakers Collection consists of two cult fighting titles from the halcyon days of the genre's first glory period. Initially developed by Visco Corporation, both Breakers (1996) and its revamped edition, Breakers' Revenge (1998) have been spruced up with a fab collection of modern-day features. These include rollback netcode, crossplay functionality, a Team Battle mode, a deep training mode, player profiles, new character color options, and a fantastic Interactive Replay mode, which gives players the opportunity to relive their losses and experiment to find out what alternate paths could have been taken.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzTmTFxuVsI\nInitially announced way back in 2019, it would seem that a simple rerelease of two '90s fighters should not have taken this long to reach fruition. However, it is clear that developer QuByte has gone all out to deliver an excellent package for these cult classics, ensuring that the ever-faithful Breakers community (and yes, it does exist) will receive the perfect product to allow them to take these funky fighters into the next generation and beyond.\nMy girl Rila has has been benched for far too long, and those nails of hers are ready for action.\nBreakers Collection launches January 12 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms. Physical editions are available to pre-order now exclusively at Strictly Limited Games. Finally, an open beta will take place on Steam the weekend of November 4, so be sure to mark your calendars.\nThe post Breakers Collection to finally bring the pain January 12 appeared first on Destructoid.",

We will release an update soon to fix this issue. In the meantime, Rainmaker has been temporarily removed from Anarchy Battle. We apologize for the inconvenience.\"\n\nSo in short, as described by reliable dataminer OatmealDome, the actual bug involves a score counter reset if you touch a checkpoint. That's...instant-shutdown worthy for a competitive mode. Funnily enough I've seen some chatter in my circles that some folks seem to like it: as they didn't enjoy Rainmaker anyway, and are enjoying it being out of the rotation.\nWhile I'm still really enjoying Splatoon 3, it's been hit by multiplayer bugs since launch, including connection issues. That last patch had roughly 100 fixes, so it was bound to mess up something else. It's the Bethesda open world RPG patch effect! That's pretty much how every major Fallout 76 patch played out in the early days, with a minor patch afterward to smooth things out.\n[Update: As of October 28, Nintendo has implemented patch 1.2.1, which fixes the Rainmaker problems stated above.

          "description": "Captain Price is Right\nAs inevitable as death, taxes, or Hamster's Arcade Archives release, Activision's newest entry to the Call of Duty franchise, Modern Warfare 2, is enjoying an incredible launch  In fact, the Steam edition of the billion-dollar head-popper has already broken the series record for concurrent players on its first day.\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, available today on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms is currently entertaining an amazing 192,524 players as of this writing. While this number, in itself, is already the highest number of concurrent CoD Steam players to date, this isn't even the peak, as MW2 already hit a pretty nutso high of 238,522 players during its first hour of launch.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeVapCrI1pY\nThat's a stunning 100,000+ players more than the previous record, which has been held by the original Call of Duty: Black Ops multiplayer since 2010. Once North America wakes up and has its first cup of Joe, it will be interesting to see if this peak number can be smashed even further. Of course, this Steam count represents only one faction of the CoD playerbase, with many choosing to play on PlayStation, Xbox, or Activision Blizzard's own Battle.net app.\nThe success of the newest Call of Duty title has been something of an annual inevitability, with even \"lesser\" entries such as last year's Call of Duty: Vanguard still pulling in sales numbers and player figures that most games can only dream of. And it seems, some 18 years from the series' initial inception — and despite perpetual complaints that the series has \"peaked\" — Call of Duty will remain one of video gaming's most lucrative and fiscally reliable franchises.\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is available now on PlayStation, PC (Steam/Battle.net), and Xbox.\nThe post Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 sees series’ biggest Steam launch appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "When Electronic Arts' Motive Studios announced its Iron Man game in September, we learned it would be the first of a multi-game deal between the publisher and Marvel. That was a vaguely defined arrangement at the time, but we now know the partnership will produce a minimum of three titles.\nEA announced the news in a press release, with the publisher describing it as a “long-term” deal that could extend beyond three games based on the wording. The release also specifies these titles will be action-adventure games for consoles and PC, each featuring original stories in the Marvel universe. \nIt's worth clarifying that EA is not getting exclusive rights to Marvel like it had with Star Wars. There are multiple Marvel games in the works at various studios, including the recently announced Captain America/Black Panther game from Amy Hennig’s Skydance New Media. \n“We have been long-time fans of Marvel and their impressive leadership, so this is a remarkable moment for our developers as well as our players and fans,” said EA COO Laura Miele. “We look forward to welcoming Marvel into the EA family of creators and know this collaboration will produce exceptional experiences for our players. We can’t wait to see players' reactions when they suit up as Iron Man and do the extraordinary things this Super Hero is known for.”\nWe’re curious to learn what other Marvel projects are on the docket and which EA studios are behind them. Motive’s Iron Man, a single-player third-person action game, is currently in pre-production, so it’s a long way from release (the team is also making the Dead Space remake). What heroes would you like to see EA tackle, and which studio do you want to see bring them to life? Let us know in the comments.",

The wacky cat-breeding roguelike is the brainchild of Super Meat Boy co-creator and The Binding of Isaac mastermind Edmund McMillen and has been in and out of the works for a decade. After being announced, put on hold, and restarted, it appears to have a new release window. \nMcMillen tweeted a gif of two of the game’s adorable cats engaging in what we'll call an intimate cat exercise. The tweet links to the game’s Steam page, which lists a 2024 release window.\nHold on to your Butts!https://t.co/wDBOizNXGl pic.twitter.com/MESXJFFXsh\nOctober 28, 2022\nWhat the heck is Mewgenics? The game tasks players with collecting and breeding hundreds of cats to train and send into battle. Or, as the Steam description puts it, Mewgenics is a “turn-based legacy roguelike draft sim about cats!” The game apparently boasts “100s of hours” of gameplay, multiple classes with over 50 unique abilities, over 200 enemies, and other features. \nMewgenics was first announced in 2012, with McMillen at the time describing it as \"By far the strangest project I've ever worked on.” McMillen has worked on it alongside Tyler Glaiel; the pair previously partnered for The End is Nigh, among other titles. The game was originally billed as a cross between Pokémon, The Sims, and Animal Crossing, and had first been planned to release in 2014. It was, of course, delayed, and its development was put on indefinite hold in 2016 when McMillen began work on The Legend of Bum-Bo, which launched in 2019. At the time, McMillen was unsure of Mewgenics’ future, but in 2018 he announced he was remaking the game to be released in “a few years.” \nThe game is slated to launch for PC, though whether or not it’s still coming to iOS is unknown. Are you still interested in Mewgenics? Let us know in the comments! For more on Edmund McMillen, we spoke with him last December where he discussed his life and career, including Mewgenics, which you can read in this interview feature.",

Silver Tempest stars Alolan Vulpix on the key art, but monsters like Lugia, Serperior, Ho-Oh, and Mawile share the spotlight. Meanwhile, players can expect cards starring Regieleki and Regidrago.\nThe Pokémon Company sent us several booster packs so we could open them and see what we pull. While it may just be dumb luck, I feel like this expansion gave me better pulls than any others in recent memory. As I cracked these open, I was met with several attractive full-art cards, as well as some gorgeous Trainer Gallery cards. I even managed to pull two of the three new Radiant Pokémon cards. \nThis expansion adds over 190 cards to the ever-growing library of Pokémon cards. That number includes 6 Pokémon VSTAR cards, 15 Pokémon V cards, 1 Pokémon VMAX card, 30 special art Trainer Gallery cards, and more than 15 Trainer cards. You can see my favorite pulls from this expansion below.\n\nPokémon Trading Card Game: Sword and Shield – Silver Tempest launches on November 11. For all things Pokémon Trading Card Game, head to our special hub by clicking on the banner below!",

We respected her,\" confirming her death. \nSega has since confirmed Kodama's death, citing that she had passed in May, according to IGN. Further details around her death will not be shared out of respect for her family's privacy, Sega says. \n\"We pray that the deceased will rest in peace, and we offer our gratitude for her enormous contributions to Sega,\" Sega of Japan says, as translated by IGN Japan. \nKodama's journey through game development began in the 1980s when she started as a graphic designer for Master System and Sega Genesis games like Altered Beast and Sonic the Hedgehog. She was the main artist for Phantasy Star and continued to work on the series' visuals team until Phantasy Star IV: The End of the Millennium, which she directed.\nOther credits include Mega Drive versions of Sorcerian, Alex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, and more. After directing Phantasy Star IV, she directed Magic Knight Rayearth in 1995 before becoming a producer and development lead on Sega's Skies of Arcadia. She continued to work in games development in some capacity until at least 2018, where she was the lead producer on the Sega compilation title Sega Ages. \nIn 2019, she was recognized with the Pioneer Award at GDC 2019. \nThe staff at Game Informer extends their condolences to Kodama's family.",

Spawned in 2007 by Capcom veterans, including Resident Evil creator Shinji Mikami and Devil May Cry and Okami mastermind Hideki Kamiya, the studio became a haven for these minds to create new franchises under the freedom of independence. Early success like MadWorld turned heads, but Platinum’s third title, Bayonetta, cemented it as one of the game industry’s premier action studios.\nLaunching in Japan in 2009 and hitting U.S. shores in 2010, Bayonetta revamped and, in some ways, improved the stylish action of its spiritual predecessor, Devil May Cry. The bewitching adventure reinvented and reinvigorated the stylish action genre; Platinum created its magnum opus in only two years. Unfortunately, sales didn’t match the reception, and Sega, the game’s original publisher, passed on a sequel. Despite fans’ cries, Bayonetta seemingly ended the series before it could take off.\nNintendo stepped up to answer those pleas by agreeing to publish a follow-up. Bayonetta 2 arrived in 2014 as a Wii U exclusive. The sequel proved Bayonetta wasn’t a one-hit wonder, becoming one of the year’s best games with some fans believing it surpassed its predecessor. The success also proved the family-friendly Nintendo had no problem letting the franchise remain true to its Mature-rated self.\nRead more...",

Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. You can also catch up on previous episodes by visiting our new Game Informer Shows YouTube channel or watching the embedded video below. \nMetal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. \n\n\nJoin me, Marcus Stewart, as I revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure.

The game is described as a collection role-playing game where players build a roster of fighters from the Mortal Kombat universe and “unleash them in massive real-time group battles.” It’s more than just battles, though – Onslaught is also said to feature a cinematic story experience where fighters have to defeat a “dark and dangerous threat.”\nThis is not the first time Mortal Kombat has appeared on a mobile device. Mortal Kombat Mobile was released in 2015 alongside Mortal Kombat X and eventually adapted characters and features from Mortal Kombat 11 as well. Mortal Kombat Mobile has been downloaded over 150 million times since its launch, so it’s no wonder WB Games wants to release more games from the franchise.\nOctober 8 marked the series’ 30th anniversary, and Mortal Kombat: Onslaught seems to be a celebration of that. Not only is it the newest mobile game in the series, but it’s also the most recent title since the release of Mortal Kombat 11 Ultimate in 2020. As far as the future of the series is concerned outside of the mobile market, Netherrealm has been pretty quiet lately. Outside of our interview with franchise co-creator Ed Boon where he said we'd have to wait a little longer, the most recent news we’ve received has been this tweet:\nPatiently waiting for news on NRS’s next game…. pic.twitter.com/1ulQHZhnKx\nOctober 15, 2022\nMortal Kombat: Onslaught is coming out sometime in 2023.
