          "description": "Pick a card, any card.\nThese days, Monolith Soft is well known for being one of Nintendo’s finest internal teams, with the Xenoblade Chronicles games delivering some of the finest open-world JRPG goodness available. Long before the company was acquired by Nintendo, however, some of the first projects it produced were the two Baten Kaitos games, both of which were originally created to address the lack of RPGs on the GameCube. Unfortunately, neither title sold very well, but they’ve now been given a second lease on life on modern hardware with Baten Kaitos I & II HD Remaster. Though neither of these games prove to be exceptional, they’re still enjoyable refreshes of an interesting phase in Monolith’s past and stand as welcome additions to the Switch's enormous RPG library.\nThe narratives of both games here — Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean (2003) and Origins (2006) — are related, though just isolated enough that you can play either release first without feeling like you’re missing out too much on important context. Baten Kaitos follows a somewhat unlikeable protagonist named Kalas, a self-interested sellsword who is hellbent on getting revenge for the deaths of his brother and grandpa. Early on in this quest, however, he inadvertently releases an old seal placed on the God of Destruction, Malpercio, kicking off a race to get to the other seals before the evil Alfard Empire can use them to fully unleash chaos across the world.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "MythFarce.\nWith its bright, cel-shaded models and notably more tame environments, MythForce targets nostalgia for Saturday Morning cartoons from the 1980s like He-Man and Thundercats. A lot of people don't remember just how poorly a lot of those cartoons hold up, though. They have their die-hard fans, and they're fun to look back at with your tongue in your cheek and a drink in your hand as you muse about how easily entertained you were as a kid, but for most they're not much worth revisiting outside of a good laugh about reused animation and some occasionally fun character designs. Similarly, even beyond its horrendous performance on Switch, MythForce proves to be an uncompelling experience that hardly holds up.\nMythForce is a first-person roguelite dungeon crawler intended (though perhaps not designed) to be played in online co-op. For all intents and purposes, it's a pretty standard multiplayer roguelite; the entire game resets itself after you lose a run, and aside from incremental upgrades, nothing you pick up will stay with you in between runs. You can choose from one of MythForce's four members, each with their own special abilities, for each run.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

She’s also been beaten, rather soundly, by a man using only his mouth.\r\n\nOr, to be more precise, a QuadStick FPS, a specialised game controller comprised of a mouth-operated joystick and several 'sip and puff' switches. It’s the favoured tool of professional streamer and Guinness World Record holder Rocky \"RockyNoHands\" Stoutenburgh, who in 2022 used it to become the first quadriplegic Elden Ring player to claim Malenia’s scalp. This was a win for a QuadStick as well: a showcase of how adaptive hardware and clever controller design could make games more accessible than ever, enabling players with disabilities to match and exceed the heroics of their able-bodied peers. And yet, there’s little sense – among disabled players, advocacy groups, or even controller manufacturers – that accessible hardware is entering its golden age. While major breakthroughs have been made, high prices and commercial concerns still carry the threat of willing, eager players being left behind.\nRead more",

It is, she points out, understandable why the sanitised Bethesda of today would leave well enough alone: \"2002's Elder Scrolls game is an overambitious, odd, scrappy, and spiky beast. It is a game happy to leave you lost, confused, misunderstanding, weirded-out, frustrated, and stuck.\"\nYet, Morrowind is loved! And in the comments of that article Nic Rueben mentioned the demo for Ardenfall, an RPG with no release date but a Steam demo. So off I toddled to have a look, and though I haven't played much of it yet, I'm confident in saying that if you liked Morrowind you should check the demo out.\nRead more",

          "description": "Paradox Interactive and new indie team C-Prompt have announced their debut 4X strategy game Millennia, which I got to play for an hour at this year's Gamescom. With development being led by former Irrational Games co-founder Robert Fermier and Age Of Empires II lead designer Ian M Fischer, Millennia will see you attempting that classic quad of Xs across ten distinct historical ages, starting in the Stone Age before eventually ending up in a \"post-modern future\", designer Ben Friedman tells me. \nThe twist here, however, is that you've also got what C-Prompt are calling 'Variant Ages', which let you bend the timeline to your will. Some of these variants are more historical in nature, such as an Age Of Monuments where everyone's building Egyptian pyramids, Friedman explains, while others are more fantastical, with the words steampunk, alchemy and space alien invasions all mentioned in the same sentence. I had a good time with it during my demo, but the real delight was seeing my home army of Kyoto go and invade neighbouring settlement Telford, before going on to conquer Rome - as you do. So if historical melting pots are your kind of 4X jam, read on. \nRead more",

CD Projekt have spent years attempting to address the underlying systemic and workplace issues and claw back some goodwill - hence, the general atmosphere on Xitter of developers needing to take five and stare at a flowerbed for a while. \"It was a rough few years but there's finally celebration and closure (for me at least),\" posted senior level designer Seb Mcbride. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Ellis Tucci grew up playing games like Thief, System Shock, and Deus Ex. Now she's making an immersive sim of her own. It's called Spectra, and it's set in the US in an alt-history 1972 where Soviet Union is the dominant military power after President Roosevelt was deposed in a fascist coup. You play as a Soviet agent tasked with infiltrating and fomenting revolution in a fortress city called Hiwatha.\nTucci wants Spectra to meet the criteria players will expect from an immersive sim. \"To me, the immersive sim is the platonic ideal of the video game\" she says. \"I've tried to deliver on that immersion by creating an environment that is extremely interactable and flexible in the ways it can be used.\" She explains that \"a quite frankly silly proportion of the buildings in each map are enterable and that \"you can turn off the lights, set traps, and use things like televisions, radios, or payphones as lures.\"\r\n\n\r\nIt sounds like everything immersive sim fans want. But there's one big difference between Spectra and the games that inspired it. Tucci is making it on her own. And she isn't the only indie developer working in one of the most ambitious, developmentally complex genres in the industry. Games like Shadows Of Doubt, Fallen Aces and Gloomwood are merely the steam rising from the bubbling magma chamber that is indie immersive sim development, Like the recent revival of retro shooters, the indie space is on the verge of an immersive sim eruption.\r\n\n \nRead more",

There are actual vampires that come back from the dead less often.

This might not sound earthshattering to anybody from outside the videogame world - what are you doing here? Run along and watch your silly non-interactive movies and TV shows - but it's quite novel for a fantasy RPG in the BioWare tradition. In my experience, at least, most RPGs only give you the build-up to a character romance, then flash-freeze the relationship post-consummation, perhaps because you've unlocked a sexy \"loyalty\" companion ability and the developers don't want to take it away from you. Baldur's Gate 3 is one of the few that thinks about how chemistry  might come and go.\r\n\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Farming life sims like Stardew Valley remain enduringly popular, and until Stardew dev ConcernedApe's Haunted Chocolatier arrives, there are plenty other games popping up like cute life sim mushrooms to horn in on our shared desire for a simpler, more rustic way of life. The route to this in Stardew Valley is actually quite hard, requiring mastery of several different interlocked systems that each ask a level of expertise that, on most days, I cannot be arsed to work towards. I love Stardew Valley, to be clear, but I hold no expectation of ever getting the most out of the farm space alloted to you as a result of your grandfather's death.\nFae Farm is a Stardewlike with a fantastical veneer and 3D graphics, but importantly it frontloads progress. It's slightly easier, in ways that seem small but cumulatively mean it takes up way less of your brain's runtime on bad days. For example: all activities, including watering your crops, use less energy than in Stardew Valley. This means you can run around clearing farm space and gathering resources, and have a working plot in just a couple of days. Heck, you can have a pretty full day in the mines before you've mechanised your farm. Game changer!\nRead more",

Or maybe even a single thesis: that the cynical, defensive, self-centred voice in your head - personified by ancient, soul-trapped, anarcho-rockstar Johnny Silverhand - offered only a literal dead-end, and that real rebellion in the face of a messed-up world lay in helping friends. It was Frank Capra with robot arms and samurai swords, and I ate it up.\nV doesn't go to Washington in Phantom Liberty, but Washington comes to her. CD Projekt Red's major expansion to the first-person RPG opens up a new district and a new cast of characters, including the President of the New United States and an aging sleeper spy played by Idris Elba. The themes remain the same, but the thesis is being tested: how can you help your friends if you don't know who they are, and if their goals are mutually exclusive?\nRead more",

          "description": "Among the chunkier morsels from yesterday's leak of Microsoft documents is an extended email from Xbox CEO Phil Spencer, dating from 2020, in which he argues that today's largest AAA videogame publishers remain dogged by their \"failure\" to adapt to the shift from physical to digital videogame distribution, and especially, subscription models such as Microsoft's own Game Pass. This inability to move with the times, Spencer suggests, has created a situation whereby the largest publishers rely on sheer \"production scale\" to attract and retain customers. \r\n\n\r\nIn turn, this has meant that publishers are unwilling to bet on new IPs - it could be billions down the drain, after all. Instead, \"AAA publishers are milking their top franchises but struggling to refill their portfolio of hit franchises\", while relying on \"rented\" IPs such as Star Wars. This is an older email, of course, and there's an obvious element of self-flattery in the shape of Microsoft talking up Game Pass. Still, it's a persuasive account of recent industry history, bolstered by Spencer's notes from conversations with Assassin's Creed outfit Ubisoft and GTA publisher Take-Two Interactive in particular.\r\n\n \nRead more",

There are silhouettes in windows sheltering from an infection that's plagued the populace and puppets who've gone awol. Take damage and you've got a chance to recoup the costs by smacking the baddie back. There's a bit where you platform down a large well, thin planks of wood marking your descent. Survive and you might want to visit your doll-like maiden and spend your souls.\nBut is Lies Of P just another boring pretender to Bloodborne? No! I think it's worked with its Gothic Pinocchio theme remarkably well, and the option to snap and configure your puppet lad to your liking makes its journey feel distinct. Sure, Lies Of P might lack some of the presence of its main inspiration, and not all of its parts come together to form a cohesive whole, but the game is an undeniable must for Soulslikers who crave the dark. It's perhaps the closest any Soulslike has felt to a FromSoft game, in everything from its presentation to the cadence of your character's jog.\nRead more",

          "description": "I dunno if you've heard of this game Starfield, but there's a lot of talk about it at the moment. It is a roleplaying experience where the role you play is not \"Viking-ish warrior who can shout with the power of a million metal frontmen\" or \"wasteland wanderer downing cans of irradiated coke\" but \"person in space following a broadly unexciting A-plot\". Much of the most interesting stuff in Starfield is on the periphery of the main story, as is the case with most Bethesda RPGs, but I find Starfield to be much less whimsical (something I won't relitigate here). As an RPG, Starfield is taking itself seriously, and sometimes this collides with the design game systems and menus.\nAn example of this is that you are supposed to experience the vastness of space, but cannot do so without going through a lot of loading screens. Another is that you have two sets of clothes: a spacesuit for places that are hostile and have no breathable atmosphere, and street clothes for planets that do. And NPCs keep making fun of me for wearing my spacesuit when I don't need to, and I hate them for it.\nRead more",

Firstly, Phil Spencer capitalises \"Gaming\", which I hate. Secondly, as noted in that linked story, Phil Spencer wants to buy Nintendo and, in pitying also-ran brackets, Valve, which has some of the same energy as me walking into an estate agent and demanding a six bedroom house with a new fitted kitchen and a hidden library. And thirdly, according to a release schedule from a presentation dated 2020, Bethesda and Zenimax have planned out their next few years of games in depressing MCU presentation-style. Boy, are the next couple of years going to be whelming.\nAs is predictable now, it is largely a list of sequels and remasters, many of them dated quite optimistically, it must be said. This document pegs Starfield for 2021, for example, and obviously that didn't happen. There are also two unnamed games on there for this year (Projects Kestrel and Platinum; 2021's Project Hibiki we know refers to the surprise-released Hi-Fi Rush) and it seems unlikely they're going to appear before the end of the year. We know The Elder Scrolls 6 isn't coming for at least another five years. They're going to remaster Oblivion (but not Morrowind, the weird cousin everyone else likes most, but whose parents aren't sure what job to give them in 2023). And they're going to make Dishonored 3.

And not because its planets are all mostly dull, lifeless husks. It's mainly because wherever I go in the universe, I'm haunted by the fleshy spectre of a misshapen man. I'm not even talking about the adoring fan (though he does also stalk my every step, too). Rather, I'm alluding to my own in-game father, who's randomly generated face and features are so utterly horrifying to me that I do a little sick in my mouth every time I run into him. Who can blame me, honestly, when his mouth is so high it clips right through his goddamn nose? \nRead more",

We've learned that Microsoft are still rather keen on buying Nintendo (and Valve), and that the company had planned out the release of Dishonored 3, an Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion remaster and a Ghostwire: Tokyo sequel during the run-up to its acquisition of ZeniMax. \r\n\n\r\nThe leaked documents also include extensive internal pitch and presentation materials regarding Microsoft's first-party gaming operations all the way to 2030. We can apparently expect a mid-generation Xbox console refresh, code-named Brooklin, in 2024; more intriguing, from a PC gaming perspective, is the promise of a 2028-bound \"hybrid\" Xbox platform, which will centre on a \"thin client\" OS that runs cloud-based games on “< $99”, \"consumer or handheld\" devices. Oh no, it's the power of the cloud all over again.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "I am in control of the RPS Game Club this month, so therefore I can do whatever I want - and this time I'm delving into the world of Hypnospace Outlaw's music. No other game sounds like Hypnospace. Featuring a veritable mountain of tracks (most of which was composed by the game's creator, Jay Tholen), Hypnospace’s extensive catalogue stretches across genres both real and imaginary. While Seepage’s Nothing Left For Me is a clear pastiche of Linkin Park, Fre3zer’s Icy Girl is a purposefully poor attempt to mimic Coolpunk, a genre built upon remixes of a jingle for a discontinued soda brand. The most exciting thing about Hypnospace is that its soundtrack is so dense and complex that there's opportunity to hyperfocus on one particular area to an intense - even problematic - degree.\nEnter The Chowder Man, a stetson wearing Kid Rock analogue who makes frequent appearances throughout Hypnospace. A prominent rock musician in the 80s, Erik Helman (portrayed beautifully by musician, comedian and inventor of the Rick Roll Hot Dad) is attempting a last-ditch revival after his music career flatlined, transforming him from Jagger-esque superstar to sold-out jingle writer. The Chowder Man’s in-game discography is strange and varied, spanning from glorious rock ballads to 22 second earworms about a microwavable butter-based dessert. Totalling ten tracks, I have decided that it is my duty - nay, my fate - to rank and review them in their entirety. So let us commence this spiritual journey together, my friends, into the complex mind of The Chowder Man. \nRead more",

A sizeable helping of the same, if a 2020-dated release schedule leaked as part of today's accidental FTC Microsoft court document blowout is to be believed. The document is from a July 2020 Microsoft presentation about the acquisition of ZeniMax, during the early months of the Covid pandemic - as such, it doesn't reflect Microsoft and ZeniMax's plans today, following global lockdowns and the buyout, and several of the dates are obviously bogus. Still, it's probably a good steer as to current and future Bethesda and ZeniMax projects, which may include Dishonored 3 and remasters of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion and Fallout 3.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Not to mention the enduring sweep of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and the Minesweeper-esque ubiquity of Skyrim. When studios get the RPG right, the end result inspires excitement and devotion in ways that feel utterly unique to the genre.\nTo this end I chatted to Dragon Age, Baldur’s Gate, and Mass Effect maestro Mark Darrah, some of the folks at Studio ZA/UM, and the minds behind the two definitive tomes on CRPG history: Matt Barton of Dungeons And Desktops, and Felipe Pepe of The CRPG Book. I wanted to ask these genere experts about all things choice and consequence, player freedom, and Baldur’s Gate 3’s phenomenal success. What turns a niche into a phenomenon? What goes into creating a great RPG? And what makes the genre so special to people? Turns out that last one is a big question to ask.\r\n\n \nRead more",

There are asteroids in the game that, for reasons known only to gods and/or programmers, follow you from orbit to orbit, flying eerily in formation with your ship, and sometimes even accompanying you to a planet's surface. \"In one of my weirdest Bethesda glitch experiences, I've got a tiny asteroid that's been following me for the past 30 hours,\" user ReverendRoo posted on Reddit, triggering an avalanche of comments reminiscent of UFO chasers spotting each other at a NASA open day. \"I would catch a glimpse of it from time to time,\" wrote fattfett. \"I tried to approach it but you can't. It stays away. I assumed it had a deeper meaning [toward] the endgame.\" Some players, like Blackdius, have multiple asteroids in tow. It seems impossible to blow them up. I've dug up a Youtube video below of one such clingy space boulder from a couple of weeks back. As you can see, it's not just a fixed background point like a screen artefact, but seems to move in response to the player's ship. Most peculiar.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "One of the things I like best about Die Gute Fabrik's forthcoming Saltsea Chronicles is an optional feature. It's a card game, Spoils, which you can play while sojourning upon the game's islands and searching for clues about your ship's missing captain, Maja. Here's how it works: two teams of two characters take turns to play cards, moving in clockwise around a table. Players must follow the lead player's suit, and the highest-scoring card wins the trick, with four tricks comprising a round. It might sound like a straightforward competition, but different islands offer different house rules, and there are twists that reflect the game's ethic of community, mutual respect and diversity, and help animate the detail of its gently post-apocalyptic oceanic world. \nThe winning card from each trick is handed to the loser, so victory is, in its way, an act of generosity. Score more than 100 points in a round, meanwhile, and the \"Hoarding\" rule means you must relinquish those points to the other team. As Die Gute Fabrik's CEO and creative lead Hannah Nicklin observes, this fits the anti-capitalist politics and mythology of Saltsea, in which \"hoarding is sort of seen as the apocryphal cause of the flood\". The Spoils tutorial menus riff on this with a cute but mildly unsettling image of a sinking ship.\nRead more",

This means that - pending a judgement from third-party legal experts, anyway - anyone can now create art of any kind set in the Fables universe. \"What was once wholly owned by Bill Willingham is now owned by everyone, for all time,\" the author wrote on his Substack. \"It's done, and as most experts will tell you, once done it cannot be undone. Take-backs are neither contemplated nor possible.\"\r\n\n\r\nYou might recognise Fables as the universe in which Telltale's The Wolf Among Us is set. It's a grubby noir fairytale world in which bedtime story characters like Snow White and Prince Charming live discreetly among regular humans, aka Mundies, having been driven from their homelands by a mysterious Adversary. I confess I've not read any of the original comics - I've only ever played the Telltale adaptation, which I enjoyed. I feel guilty about that in hindsight, because Willingham seems to have a pretty dim view of Telltale's work, though that's partly to do with what he considers to be his longstanding unfair treatment by Fables publisher DC Comics.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The terrible beauty of that generator-based exploration and scavenging loop. That moment when you walk just a little too quickly down a corridor, and hear the awful rummaging in the walls. The agonising discovery that not only is it possible to roam with the lights out, but pretty much required, beyond a certain point. The dense burden of grasping more or less where to go, without knowing how to survive the journey - and above all else, those goddamn rats, always encountered where least convenient. Shoo! Shoo!\nIt's by far the most oppressive and demanding horror game I've played in recent memory, and it'll get considerably worse with the release of the Halloween update.\nRead more",

FFXIV’s lead director and producer Naoki Yoshida — known as Yoshi P — wanted to create something that was \"fun, but relaxing”, and there aren’t a lot of material rewards for the time you put in. You can sell the fish or break them down into other materials, but really the only reason to fish is for the sake of fishing itself. \r\n\nAnd yet today Final Fantasy XIV is home to a close knit fishing community of over 27,000 people. This single shared interest has spun off into many different directions, including fishing as a competitive journey, the process of building a space for the hobby itself, and even a kind of metagame. But the main thread tying these all together is the love for fishing, and the community’s central hub is actually located outside of the game - in a Discord server called Fisherman’s Horizon, lovingly nicknamed Fishcord. \r\n\n \nRead more",

Frankly, it's getting repetitive, and while the obvious remedy is to plunge cackling and crying into a star system with an AI threat level in the high double digits, I doubt that will really alter the rhythms of Starfield's ship combat - it'll just mean I have to do some grinding.\n  \nRead more",

You do the math(s).\nI actually wrote about Deathbulge in a round up of best demos in a Steam Next Fest back in 2020, at which time I enjoyed the RPG antics of a band entering a cursed Battle Of The Bands competition and finding out that it's a fight to the death. The full thing came out a month ago without my noticing, and got past the endpoint of the demo. It's fun! I'm enjoying the combat, which is both real-time and turn-based, and has some surprisingly deep tactics attached to it.

A sparkling sliver of Swiss Army handheld design, providing a familiar taste of desktop play that the Steam Deck or Asus ROG Ally could never achieve without a USB dock.\nTurns out, now that I’ve tried the Legion Go for myself, I was worried about the wrong thing. It’s nowhere near as heavy or cumbersome as it looks, and while the breakaway controls remain an exciting prospect, they also risk introducing an acute pain point. At the very least, the model I tested proved highly vulnerable to lead-handed RPS hardware editors, because I left the building very much with the impression that I’d broken it.\nRead more",

However, between these two games was a title that remained exclusive to the platform, and that was the bizarrely named Syd of Valis. The Japanese title makes more sense. It’s SD Valis, named such because it uses a “super deformed” anime art style, which might be better known in the West as “Chibi.”\n\n\nWhy? Fucked if I know.\n\n\nSyd of Valis is presumably a play on the whole “SD” thing, but then the game goes on to refer to Yuko, the protagonist, as Syd, while the manual and box cover do not.\n\n\nSo, anyway, that’s a great start. Syd of Valis tells the same story as Valis II, but with smaller characters, essentially. And with a dumber name.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nEnemy!!\n\n\nSyd of…",

          "description": "Stardew Valley remains among the most beloved indie games of the past decade, and its content updates over the years help maintain its popularity. Developer ConcernedApe fuels the farming fanfare with additions both big and small, and it looks like he's teasing another. \n\n\nThe newest of these teases is an image of a parrot on top of a blue perch. It's a cute picture, but the bird's demand for money and capital J on the perch implies there's more to it.\n\n\n\n\nFans noted these features and ascribed them to Jojamart, the supermarket chain that works as Stardew Valley's antagonist. Blue is the company's primary color and is transparently greedy just as this bird seems to be. \n\n\nStardew Valley's farm-hungry community also noted the tropical setting, leading some to speculate that Joja reached Ginger Island. Some assume Jojamart expanded into Ginger Island, so its reach goes beyond Pelican Town. Others speculate that the parrot is an upcoming incentive for players to pursue working with Jojamart.\n\n\nWhatever the answer is, ConcernedApe is keeping mum about the situation. Whether it's for Stardew Valley's 1.6 updates or screenshots from the upcoming Haunted Chocolatier, any context given is often vague.\n\n\nIt's an effective way to stir up Stardew chatter, as fans get a look into an upcoming project only to have more questions than answers. I'm among them, so I eat these teasers up while coming up with my own wild theories. \n\n\nPart of me gets annoyed these teasers have no elaboration, but it also adds to the fun of wondering. Whatever the answer is, a parrot demanding money from players fits right in with all of Stardew Valley's oddities. As for when we'll see the bird, no one knows for now. Stardew Valley version 1.6 doesn't have a release date yet. \n\nThe post Stardew Valley tweet teases money-hungry parrot appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "8-Bit Legit has announced they'll be handling the publishing duties for Project Blue, an NES-style cyberpunk sidescroller by ToggleSwitch/FrankenGraphics that is coming to modern consoles with a physical release on NES.\n\n\nWriting about new NES games never gets old. Project Blue casts you as Blue, a child trying to escape a research laboratory in Neo Hong Kong. The trailer advertises Perfect Blue as being built from 256 screens, which kind of makes it look like the underappreciated Legacy of the Wizard. In fact, a lot of the game looks like a futuristic Legacy of the Wizard, which I am totally down for. The publisher also says that there will be three difficulty levels that will modify the game’s layout, which is pretty spiffy.\n\n\n\n\nIt’s worth noting that you can already grab Project Blue on PC over on Itch. 8-Bit Legit is the publishing arm of Retrotainment Games and Mega Cat Studios, and is just handling publishing on consoles. I know Retrotainment from Garbage Pail Kids, which was a pretty terrific NES release.\n\n\nI’m always on board for a new NES game. We’ve come a long way from the early days of homebrew titles. Now, we’ve got boutique publishers who handle all the curation and quality control. It’s nice to have the option to play it on modern consoles, but given the option, give me that plastic rectangle and let me slot it into my computer-toaster.\n\n\nProject Blue is currently available on PC. The console version will be available for pre-order starting on September 29, 2023, and the retail release will follow on October 6, 2023.\n\nThe post Project Blue is a cyberpunk sidescroller coming to Switch, Xbox, and… NES appeared first on Destructoid.",

But hidden away in 2077 is a reference just for Cyberpunk: Edgerunners fans, and an especially emotional one at that.\n\n\nIt's no surprise that, after the massive popularity of the Studio Trigger and Netflix anime, CD Projekt would find a way to work the world of Edgerunners more into its digital Night City in Cyberpunk 2077. Heck, we've already seen a few additions, ranging from a special gun to David's signature jacket.

The next step in Honkai Impact 3rd's journey is due to depart in February 2024.\n\n\nWhile many in the western world became familiar with HoYoverse / miHoYo through Genshin Impact, Honkai Impact 3rd was the game that came before, and still holds a solid playerbase throughout its seven-year lifespan. This new chapter, Honkai Impact 3rd Part 2, heads to Mars.\n\n\nCheck out the first look below to get a glimpse at what HoYoverse is cooking up for this new chapter:\n\n\n\n\nIt seems like Honkai Impact 3rd Part 2 is a direct follow-up to the base Honkai Impact 3rd, but in what manner, I'm not sure. HoYoverse looks to be improving the combat, exploration, and more in Part 2, as well as departing on a new story branch of some kind.\n\n\nI've played some Genshin and actually really dug Honkai Star Rail, but 3rd has eluded me a bit. Still, that might make this new release of Honkai Impact 3rd a good jumping-on point. Taking some of the popularity drummed up by Genshin Impact and Honkai Star Rail, and then funneling it back into the two games' predecessor, would be a good play to grab some curious folks already intrigued by HoYoverse's world.\n\n\nA world away\n\n\nStill, Part 2 isn't the only impending HoYoverse title. Alongside updates to Genshin and Star Rail, the company is also still working on Zenless Zone Zero, a stylish action RPG that's been on my radar for a while.\n\n\nHoYoverse recently confirmed that Z3 (as I call it in Slack) is coming to consoles, alongside a PC and mobile version. It's unclear when that might be, exactly, but it's a nice addition.\n\n\nAnd it's another game to add to the growing roster of HoYoverse titles. Keeping up with them all seems like quite a lot, but if you like the look and charm of these games, it sure seems like you won't be hurting for more of them next year.\n\nThe post HoYoverse announces Honkai Impact 3rd Part 2 for February 2024 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Cozy games have carved a chill little niche for themselves, and you don't get much cozier than the Shire. The home of the Hobbits is the subject of a new game from publisher Private Division and developer Weta Workshop. The two paired up to announce Tales of the Shire: A The Lord of the Rings Game, currently planned for 2024. \n\n\nSpecific platforms weren't announced, but the official Twitter is live and lists the game for consoles and PC. You can see a quick live-action preview in the teaser trailer.\n\n\n\n\nPipe-weed dreams\n\n\nThere isn't much in the way of information beyond what little we see in the teaser. Like anything chill and Hobbit-related, the video shows someone putting the finishing touches on some book illustrations. If said book covers another harrowing journey, we're not likely to take any part of that in this quaint entry. The official accounts describe it as a \"cozy The Lord of the Rings game set in the Middle-earth universe.\" \n\n\nThis all follows last August's news of Private Division and Weta Workshop signing a deal for a new game set in Middle-earth. Weta has worked intimately with J.R.R. Tolkien's world, handling effects for Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings films, among many other projects. Now we'll just have to wait to see exactly how relaxing this take on the material will be once it launches.\n\n\nTales of the Shire is just one of the new projects in the works based on The Lord of the Rings. There's also Return to Moria, which will hopefully wipe the taste of Gollum (yuck, sorry) out of everyone's mouths. \n\nThe post Tales of the Shire to show the cozy side of Lord of the Rings in 2024 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Microsoft and Rare have given details on the upcoming Season 10 of their shanty-inspiring game, Sea of Thieves. If you have friends, you might be interested in guilds. If you’re like me and don’t have friends, then the private sessions are going to be more up your alley.\n\n\nFirst off, Season 10 is going to introduce guilds into the game. These are organizations for up to 24 players. Within these guilds, players and crews team up to accomplish common goals. Their success will help boost the Guild Reputation, and doing so will unlock new cosmetics for everyone involved. Guilds can be customized with names, branding, and mottos so you can all unite under a single humiliating banner.\n\n\nSeason 10’s addition of private sessions is more geared toward the introvert. Whether you have a tight group of friends or would just rather play alone, the “Safer Seas” mode strips out the PvP involved with other players sailing around. Instead, you can focus on completing Tall Tales or doing some fishing without worrying about distant cannonballs.\n\n\nHowever, if you hate people and want to get back at them for existing, then there’s also a competitive addition in Season 10. This comes in the form of a new world event where you attempt to find the Skull of Siren Song. The catch is that any crew that accepts the quest has the same map, leading them to the same spot. Moreover, if you get there first, you’ll only find half of the treasure, which immediately illuminates you with a beacon that everyone can see. So, whoever has that second half is going to be looking for you.\n\n\nSea of Thieves is available on PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. Season 10 starts on October 19th.\n\nThe post I might actually play Sea of Thieves when Season 10 makes it easier to play alone appeared first on Destructoid.",

The game also features a stellar soundtrack courtesy of audio director Mark Lampert and composer Inon Zur.\n\n\nIf you've fallen in love with Starfield's soundtrack, you can enjoy the lo-fi version of it courtesy of Bethesda. The studio released Lofi Girl remixes, giving you the perfect background music when you're sailing across the Settled Systems. \n\n\n\n\nIn typical Bethesda fashion, Starfield features a soundtrack that is grand yet sits neatly in the background as you embark on your adventures. There are plenty of spacey synths and grand orchestras that lend themselves quite well to both space exploration and lo-fi remixes. \n\n\nIf you're interested, you can listen to Zur and Lampert discuss how they created Starfield's captivating music. They are cleverly able to explain some of their more abstract ideas, such as how the melodies have been composed to form circular patterns. Players who have completed Starfield and headed into New Game+ will understand how this mirrors the game's structure. \n\n\nCan't get enough of the soundtrack?

          "description": "After a week of hints and teasers, Paradox Interactive has finally revealed its new title: Millennia. In Millennia, players will create their own nation in a historical turn-based 4X environment. From there, players will shape the nation across 10,000 years of history starting with the dawn of humanity and stretching into the future. According to Paradox, each playthrough will be unique as you craft an epic story based on your actions. The new strategy title is being developed by C Prompt Games, who doesn't seem to have much of a history. Based on their Steam page, the only previous title by them is a digital board game called Heretic Operative. A teaser trailer was included in the announcement that briefly shows some of the many different Ages you can experience.\n\n\n\n\nMany ages throughout the Millennia\n\n\nIn the trailer alone we see quite a few Ages starting with some rather common periods for the genre. Stone, Bronze, Iron, Kings, and Discovery, are all familiar periods in a historical 4X strategy game. However, near the end of the teaser, we get a glimpse at some rather peculiar Ages such as the Age of Old Ones, Age of Visitors, Age of Archangel, and even Age of Rogue AI. Wait did that say Old Ones? Where do I sign up?\n\n\nBased on the screenshots on the Millennia Steam page, it looks like gameplay will be similar to the Civilization series and Humankind. The big difference here though appears to be the many different ways your nation can go, as opposed to just vertical technological advances.\n\n\nI'm a huge fan of Paradox titles, but don't get into Civilization-like games as easily. For comparison, I have almost 400 hours in Stellaris yet only 50 in Civilization VI. As such, I had trouble really getting into Humankind. I'm hoping Millennia does enough different to keep me playing like previous Paradox titles.\n\n\nMillennia is aiming for a 2024 release on PC.\n\nThe post Paradox reveals new 4X game Millennia, and it looks like Civilization appeared first on Destructoid.",

In past looks, the game was only announced for PC, iOS and Android.\n\n\nWhich consoles Zenless Zone Zero will be released for is, unfortunately, still a mystery. But if this game follows in its older sibling Genshin Impact’s footsteps, we can probably expect it to come to PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5. It most certainly could also come to Nintendo Switch, though Genshin Impact has not been made available for that platform as of writing — though it has been confirmed.\n\n\n\n\nThe TGS Special Program for Zenless Zone Zero features Yuka Iguchi and Yumi Igarashi, the voice actors behind Koleda and Corin, who discuss the game at length, from its setting as “the last urban civilization,” to “aspects such as the city and character design,” according to HoYoVerse. It’s about nineteen minutes in length, but as of writing, it has yet to be translated into English.\n\n\nZenless Zone Zero is, according to the official YouTube channel, a game taking place in “a dangerous world under constant threat from the mysterious calamities known as the \"Hollows\", where the old civilization has been destroyed and world order lays in ruins.” It’s up to a variety of characters to take a stand and defeat the Hollows, each with their own unique reasons for fighting.\n\nThe post HoYoverse confirms Zenless Zone Zero is also coming to consoles appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "While the Steam Deck has set the trend for portable PC-style gaming handhelds, there is some stiff competition aiming to make waves. The ASUS ROG Ally released recently and the Lenovo Legion GO is on the horizon. As such, Valve needs to keep ahead of the game, but a new iteration of the Deck may be some time off.\n\n\nAccording to a report from The Verge, Valve's own Pierre-Loup Griffais told the publication that he doesn't anticipate a leap in performance that won't compromise on battery life for \"the next couple of years.\"\n\n\n\n\nThis suggests that a Steam Deck 2 may not be on the horizon for some time. Indeed, Griffais, speaking to CNBC at the Tokyo Game Show, said the company is looking at a \"stable target\" over the next two years, suggesting that the team may not be looking to pursue a newer, more advanced model just yet.\n\n\nHow will Valve keep up with the market?\n\n\nWe know that the Half-Life developer is considering a follow-up to its popular Steam Deck device. However, Griffais' words make it seem like there won't be one on the market for the foreseeable future.\n\n\nA lot can happen in terms of technological leaps in a couple of years. How will Valve hope to retain its position in the mobile gaming world if it's not looking at a new model just yet?\n\n\nThe report from The Verge speculates that a refresh of the Steam Deck could be a possible go-between. With the Nintendo Switch and graphics cards getting refreshed mid-generation, we could see something similar happen to the Deck, but it may not be one with more processing power or better hardware overall.\n\n\nOf course, that's all just speculation. You never know what can happen in this industry and as competition heats up in the market, Valve will likely be keeping a close eye on how the technology advances.\n\nThe post We might not see a new Steam Deck for at least a couple of years appeared first on Destructoid.",

Combining some of the assets of one Bethesda game with the world of another (or vice versa) was an inevitability. Trust the modding community to come through for us.\n\n\nIf you head over to Nexus Mods, user ndreams has just released a mod for Skyrim that lets you become companions with Starfield's own Sarah Morgan, aka the Chair of Constellation.\n\n\nImage via ndreams/Nexus Mods.\n\n\nIt looks like a fairly simple change to The Elder Scrolls 5, adding Morgan in as a \"vanilla follower\" who can be seen wearing a standard miner outfit. Unfortunately, it doesn't say whether or not she still retains any of her dialogue, so we may have to assume that she doesn't.\n\n\nWhere can I find her?\n\n\nLike with any follower – in Starfield or Skyrim – you'll need to seek Sarah Morgan out before you can have her in your employ. The mod description page says she can be found wandering the streets of Whiterun during the day, or by the Temple of Kynareth at night.\n\n\nYou might need to do some tinkering before you can get her as a follower. For example, ndreams recommends some different textures. Other than that, it should be a pretty straightforward install.\n\n\nSince Starfield came out just a few weeks ago, we've already seen a ruck of custom mods for the game. And more are coming out all the time. Indeed, there's even been some crossover, such as this one, which is aiming to turn the Bethesda RPG into Star Wars.\n\nThe post Starfield’s Sarah Morgan can be your Skyrim companion with this mod appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "LEGO's Super Mario line is about to add a very hungry desk display piece in the form of a Piranha Plant figure. It may not be to scale, but it's over nine inches tall and priced at $59.99. The set is yours to build and, if you choose, set alight with a fireball on November 6, 2023.\n\n\nThe LEGO Piranha Plant comes in a buildable pipe, which, yeah, I guess all LEGO things are buildable. Its head, mouth, stalk, and leaves are all posable. You'll finally be able to capture that perfect \"Mario's about to get eaten alive\" pose right on your shelf. Listed for builders 18 and older, the set is made up of 540 pieces. \n\n\nImage via LEGO\n\n\nAfter-hours flowers\n\n\nThat's right, this is an adults only Piranha Plant. Like The Mighty Bowser set before it, the Piranha Plant is marketed to all the grown-ups out there who need more Mario foes on their shelves. I am absolutely including myself in that demographic. For my money, they nailed the look of this one, at least more so than Bowser. You might think it's hard to mess up a Piranha Plant, but you'd be surprised. \n\n\nOne thing this set is missing is any kind of digital play functions. It can't interact with any of the other Super Mario LEGO sets, but it looks fine enough on its own. The best part is the fairly reasonable price. It would be hard to top the wallet-busting Bowser and NES LEGO sets, priced at $269.99 and $229.99, respectively. This is one plant I may actually be able to keep alive for longer than a week. \n\nThe post LEGO Mario Piranha Plant takes a bite out of shelves this November appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Although a decade old, Final Fantasy XIV remains one of the best live-service games/MMORPGs to jump into. Its sprawling narrative and fascinating world were big draws to players like me, and now fans will can experience the world again from a new perspective.\n\n\nIn commemorating FFXIV's 10th anniversary, Square Enix is adapting the game into a tabletop RPG. Many popular games make their way to the tabletop format and FFXIV is not a bad pick to adapt.\n\n\nBased on the announcement and teaser website, FFXIV TTRPG operates something like Dungeons & Dragons. Anywhere from 3-5 players work as adventurers in Eorzea to complete quests and go on TTRPG hijinks. Also like D&D, a gamemaster manages sessions and controls the general pacing assuming the players don't hijack the session.\n\n\nA starter set is all that's available, but for $60 it comes with guidebooks for players and gamemasters along with some accessories like a map and character tokens. There are also multiple scenarios pre-planned by the FFXIV development team to give players/gamemasters an introduction to its structure. It's not a bad deal assuming everything included is high-quality.\n\n\nI love FFXIV and D&D, so this package is tailor-made for me. Potentially remaking my Miqo'te as a tabletop character is an awesome prospect and already a big sell for me.\n\n\nAnyone who wants to pick up FFXIV TTRPG has to wait until May 2024 for it to come out. Pre-orders are available on Square Enix's website, and the wait gives me enough time to pester my friends into trying out FFXIV.\n\nThe post Final Fantasy XIV is getting its own tabletop RPG adaptation appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "We won't be getting a Sonic Mania sequel just yet, but we can expect a classic Sonic experience this year thanks to Sonic Superstars. We already know that the game will feature 2D side-scrolling, though it has ditched the pixel art style of Sonic Mania. Jun Senoue will be handling the soundtrack with some help from Tee Lopes. \n\n\n\n\nAs the release date draws nearer, Sega has been dropping quite a few teasers, including a music track reveal. The latest tease comes in the form of a gorgeous animated short movie serving as the prequel to Sonic Superstars. You'll be familiar with this colorful animation style if you've played Sonic games released in the past few years such as Sonic Origins. \n\n\nImage via Sega.\n\n\nSonic's troublesome trio\n\n\nThe short movie, titled Trio of Trouble, starts with Fang the Hunter up against Sonic, Tails, Amy, and Knuckles. Fortunately, Sonic and his friends outsmart Fang. \n\n\nFang isn't the only villain around, however. Dr. Eggman also makes an appearance and we get to see more of Trip, who is a new foe. As the prior reveal illustrated, Trip is dressed in metal armor, and she is quite clumsy and prone to setting off booby traps. \n\n\nWorking together, Fang and Trip subdue a slippery serpent, but that isn't quite what Dr. Eggman had in mind. Though they seem like a ragtag group of villains tripping over themselves, it does seem like they'll pose a significant challenge.\n\n\nYou can play Sonic Superstars when it launches on October 17 on Nintendo Switch, PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S.  \n\nThe post Sega releases adorable animated prologue for Sonic Superstars appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Resident Evil fans have been waiting for Resident Evil 4 Remake's VR mode, and at this year's Tokyo Game Show, we saw a bit more of what's in store. The free VR mode, which will be released on PS VR2, will allow you to experience Leon Kennedy's tale in the most immersive way possible. \n\n\n\n\nAs we learned from the latest trailer, the mode will feature realistic gunplay. You can experience this in Resident Evil Village's VR mode where guns need to be physically reloaded and cocked back before you can fire, raising the tension in the game's most frightening moments. The ability to throw knives is also back. \n\n\nCare has been taken to ensure a smooth VR experience. Hence you'll be able to break crates holding loot with a single button press. You'll also get to enjoy immersive 3D audio, allowing you to sense which direction foes are coming at you from. \n\n\nImage via Capcom. \n\n\nResident Evil 4 VR mode questions remain\n\n\nThough we've learned a lot about the upcoming VR mode, there is still a lot that is left unanswered. There's been no word yet on whether the DLC will support VR but if it's anything like Resident Evil Village, it'll be an exclusively main story feature. \n\n\nThere's also no certainty of whether you'll be able to transfer your progress from the regular mode to the VR mode. Village did not have this feature which doesn't give much hope that we'll get it this time around. \n\n\nYou can expect the game in Winter this year. Until then there's the action-packed Separate Ways DLC to indulge in. \n\nThe post Resident Evil 4 Remake VR mode details revealed appeared first on Destructoid.",

Join us today on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. Central as we take a bloody journey through the game's genre-defining story campaign. Episodes will be uploaded to our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel the following Saturday morning. \nAfter 2006's Mortal Kombat: Armageddon seemingly concluded the franchise's main narrative, 2011's entry picked up the bloody pieces. It moved the saga forward by resetting the timeline, serving as a soft reboot that brought Mortal Kombat back to its 2D fighting roots and ushering in the return of the classic roster. MK 9's cinematic story mode served as an epiphany for the series and fighting games as a whole, establishing the blueprint for narrative fighting campaigns still utilized today. MK9's story also serves as the first chapter of the modern trilogy of games that Mortal Kombat 1 builds upon. For a whole lot more on MK9 and its development, you can read this feature on how the reboot saved the franchise.\nJoin editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they battle their way through MK 9 to see how its reimagined tournament holds up. \nPart 1 - Surpr-iced! \nPart 2 - Bringing The Smoke\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

          "description": "Last month, Microsoft submitted a new deal to the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority regulatory agency that proposes Ubisoft get the rights to Activision Blizzard game streaming for 15 years. Microsoft did this to get its acquisition of Activision Blizzard approved by the CMA after the regulator previously blocked it over cloud gaming concerns. One month later, the CMA has granted preliminary approval to Microsoft due to its new Ubisoft deal. \nThe CMA says it has \"identified limited residual concerns with the new deal\" but that Microsoft has put forward remedies (see: Ubisoft's role) that the CMA \"has provisionally concluded should address these issues.\" The CMA is now consulting on those remedies before making a final official decision ahead of the October 18 deadline to do so. \n\n\n\"…",

The game is coming to Microsoft’s consoles and Windows PC early next year.\nThe RPG was first released to PlayStation consoles, Switch, and PC in February. Octopath Traveler II, like its predecessor, sees players guide eight adventurers across a sprawling adventure in an HD-2D rendered world. Though similar on the surface, the sequel has been praised for its improvements in storytelling, character development, progression, and navigation. \nIn our review, we scored Octopath Traveler II an 8.5 out of 10, with guest writer Josh Broadwell writing that “Octopath Traveler II does what an excellent sequel should. Instead of breaking new ground left and right, it improves on the original in nearly every way and feels more confident about the stories it tells.”",

This release date was revealed in a new gameplay trailer from IGN for Assassin's Creed Nexus VR, which gives us another look at the game's three protagonist assassins: Ezio from Assassin's Creed II, Connor from Assassin's Creed III, and Kassandra from Assassin's Creed Odyssey. \nIn the trailer, we get a look at how combat and parkour will work in the game. As expected, given the game is a VR exclusive title, everything happens from a first-person perspective. As Connor, players will explore 18th Century America during the American Revolution. As Ezio, players will parkour through 15th Century Italy during the Italian Renaissance, and as Kassandra, players will fight as a mercenary assassin through ancient Greece. \nCheck out the Assassin's Creed Nexus VR gameplay trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Assassin's Creed Nexus VR looks pretty much exactly as you'd expect for an Assassin's Creed game in VR. All the assassin tropes are still there, fortunately, like leaps of faith, hidden blades, parkour, and more. \nAssassin's Creed Nexus VR hits Meta Quest devices on November 16. \nWhile waiting for its release, check out this Assassin's Creed Nexus VR trailer from June and then read our preview after checking out more of the game earlier this summer. \nAre you going to check out Assassin's Creed Nexus VR in November?

Luckily, developer Larian Studios has released two major patches to the game, and while the third was set to release today, it's been delayed to tomorrow. In a post on X, the site formerly known as Twitter, the developers announced the patch would be delayed \"to ensure thorough testing.\" This is likely done to avoid the issue they ran into when they had to roll back a hotfix last month.\nWhile we know the patch has been delayed, before now we didn't have much of an idea of what that patch included. While specific bug fixes are still unknown, Larian tweeted about a new feature to expect tomorrow: the ability to change your character's appearance. This includes details like pronouns, voice actor, and specific facial features, but notably does not allow you to change your race, which could alter the story depending on your choice. \nWith Patch 3 comes the Magic Mirror, which lives in your camp and allows you to change your Tav’s appearance whenever you’d like!\npic.twitter.com/LJ6y9CZ58F\nSeptember 21, 2023\nEven though the patch plans have been derailed, Baldur's Gate 3 still launches on Mac today, so if you've been meaning to grab it on that platform, now's the chance to do so. We'd highly recommend it, and you can read about why in our glowing review of the game. If you've been playing the game and enjoying it, maybe it's a sign you should try D&D, the game it's based on, as well.",

          "description": "In an announcement I personally never could have predicted, the 2001 PlayStation 2 Capcom video game Onimusha: Warlords (and subsequent sequels) is getting an anime adaption for Netflix. The reveal is surprising for a number of reasons. The franchise is not one that is particularly well-known or currently popular. Also, the anime seems to have little to do with the original game. Protagonist Samanosuke Akechi does not make an appearance in the trailer. But, like Samanosuke, who was modeled after Japanese actor Kaneshiro Takeshi, the anime's protagonist, Miyamoto Musashi, is modeled after the late Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune. Coincidentally, Onimusha 2's protagonist, Jubei Yagyu, was modeled after Japanese actor Yūsaku Matsuda, who had also passed away well before the game released. It's an odd throughline for the series but is a key element.\nThe other surprise for the adaptation is it is being co-directed by Takashi Miike. Miike is known for films like Ichi The Killer and Audition, but he also has another big Capcom franchise under his directorial belt with Ace Attorney, a film adaption of the Phoenix Wright games.\nI played Onimusha for the first time in earnest when it released on Switch and enjoyed revisiting it and finally beating it. You can find more of my thoughts on that topic here.\n\n\nThe anime premieres November 2 on Netflix.",

          "description": "Sega and Like a Dragon series developer Ryu Ga Gotoku (RGG) Studio held a presentation this morning sharing all kinds of new details for its upcoming games, Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth and Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name.\nFirst up, it shared a 10-minute story trailer for Infinite Wealth, which shared so many details that I am hesitant to write them all here in fear of spoiling potentially major plot beats in the game. The summary is that Ichiban Kasuga is offered the opportunity to find his mother, which means he must travel to Honolulu, Hawaii. Returning characters make an appearance, Ichiban will apparently be fighting sharks and giant squids, taking part in fun Hawaii activities like surfing, and, expectedly, will be getting into all kinds of trouble with the local gangs. Kazamu Kiryu's role also gets somewhat defined in the trailer.\n\n\nSome details not in the trailer include the fact that the playable party now has full freedom of movement while fighting, allowing for more strategy. The game includes a Crazy Taxi-inspired minigame, among many other money-making opportunities. Actors Danny Trejo (Machete) and Daniel Dae Kim (Lost) will also be playing Dwight, the leader of the Barracudas gang, and Masataka Ebina, the ruthless captain of the local yakuza syndicate, respectively. You can check out some additional screenshots for the game below.\n\nAlongside the story trailer, there is also a five-minute gameplay trailer.\n\n\nArguably, the biggest news from the event, however, is Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth's release date, which isn't far off. The game releases January 26 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, and PC. Preorders for the game will net you the Hero’s Booster Pack, to level up faster, and a Special Job Set that includes the Linebacker and Tennis Ace jobs.\nAlongside all the Infinite Wealth details, Sega and RGG also released the full opening cinematic for Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, which you can watch below.",

The game’s planned Switch version has also been canceled.\nIn a statement posted to X (formerly known as Twitter), Saber explains that despite only releasing the game last May, it’s effectively moving on from it. Saber doesn't give a reason behind the decision, but states that it still plans to fix any major bugs and will keep the servers running “for the foreseeable future.” Check out its full statement below. \nEvil Dead: The Game is an asymmetrical multiplayer game set within the popular film universe where players control Ash and his friends to survive against a player-controlled Kandarian Demon. We weren’t particularly enamored with the title at launch, with video editor Alex Van Aken scoring the game a 6 out of 10, writing in his review, \"It’s incredibly one-sided for a game all about two sides. And it’s majorly unbalanced.\" You can watch a team of editors tackle the game in this episode of New Gameplay Today.",

It's how we learned Xbox head Phil Spencer considered acquiring Nintendo and Warner Bros. Games at one point, that Xbox is planning an Xbox Series X/S refresher for next year, that it might be working on remasters of Fallout 3 and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, and that Microsoft has plans for a next-gen hybrid console in 2028. \nThe leaks were quite extensive, and after some online confusion, we learned via Bloomberg that Microsoft accidentally provided federal courts with confidential (and not redacted) documents. Following news of these leaks, Spencer has now addressed what’s happened with a brief statement on Twitter. \nWe've seen the conversation around old emails and documents. It is hard to see our team's work shared in this way because so much has changed and there's so much to be excited about right now, and in the future. We will share the real plans when we are ready.\nSeptember 19, 2023\nHe shared that on Twitter, but The Verge has obtained a more in-depth memo sent to Xbox employees. Here it is, in full: \nSomething of note, especially for those particularly excited about something that might have leaked today, is that in both the internal memo to Xbox employees and the public-facing statement posted to Twitter, Spencer says these leaked documents and email are old and plans have changed. He also says the team will share \"the real plans\" when ready. Now, he obviously can't say the leaked information is what's happening and must downplay it as a result, but it's also a reminder to take everything that has come to light with a grain of salt because it's very likely plans have changed.\n[Source: The Verge]",

Whether it's the rush of stars streaking past a ship going into hyperspace or the distinct hum of a lightsaber, Respawn really went all out to match the aesthetic of one of the world's biggest movie franchises. One of the most important elements in achieving that is through music, and while the Star Wars sound is iconic and well-known, a good video game score has to be more than just an imitation of what came before. The music for Jedi: Survivor was written by Stephen Barton and Gordy Haab, and when I ask them what makes a good video game soundtrack, they answer in unison.\n\"Emotional weight.\"\nOur interview is done on a video call with each composer …",

During today's Nintendo Direct, Nintendo revealed this collection of games with a new trailer showing enhanced visuals while pulling back the curtains on protagonist Ashley, who is traveling to the remote Blood Edward Island in search of her father. \nCheck out the Another Code: Recollection reveal trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAfter Ashley receives a letter from her father, who she believes to be dead, a chain of mysteries and visions from the past is set off, sending her to Blood Edward Island. There, Ashley must investigate her surroundings while solving puzzles to reveal the truth. Another Code: R completes Ashley's tale. In it, she journeys to Lake Juliet two years after the events of Trace Memory to uncover the hidden truth surrounding her mother. \n\"This collection includes fully enhanced versions of both original games, featuring overhauled visuals, fully explorable environments, new voice acting, puzzles, music, and more,\" Nintendo's description of the game reads. \"Optional hint and navigation systems have been added to help players new to adventure games.\" \nAnother Code: Recollection will cost $59.99 and launch on Switch on January 19, 2024. \nHave you ever played these games?

These two will be released as a single set. The Noah Amiibo gets you Consul N’s Armor for Noah in-game and the Leisure Time outfits for Noah, Lanz, and Eunie.

Yesterday, Plex informed users that it will no longer allow users to run servers at a hosting provider where lots of TOS violations occur. While copyright infringement isn't specifically mentioned, the action appears anti-piracy focused.\nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",

Since Lars Sundström, aka lman, joined our team as the iOS porter, we have made significant progress. Thus, you no longer need to compile ScummVM yourself in order to add it to your iOS or iPadOS device. \nIf you want to help by testing this version, just follow this Testflight link and enroll yourself in the test program. This may require installing Apple’s Testflight app. You can find instructions on how to install games and how to play them on our documentation portal.\nWe truly appreciate your feedback. You can share your thoughts with the Testflight feedback feature, where you can attach screenshots and post detailed descriptions. Alternatively, you can use our bugtracker, e-mail us at ios@scummvm.org, or post on our Discord Server. Your help will let us eventually add ScummVM to the App Store.\n>",
