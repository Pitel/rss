          "description": "Planetary exploration has never been so chill.\nThe first Switch Doraemon: Story of Seasons launched in 2019 and was praised for harmoniously combining the cast of the much-loved children's anime with the relaxing gameplay of one of the most well-known farm sim franchises, and while it may not be the most obvious combination, its beautiful art style and pleasant vibes were generally well-received nonetheless. So it's no surprise that its success has led to the release of the sequel, Doraemon Story of Seasons: Friends of the Great Kingdom.\nHowever, there are a lot more life and farm sims on the market these days, and while developer Marvelous will have wanted to maintain the original game's charm, it also needed to present something exciting and new to stop things from feeling repetitive or stale. The original Doraemon Story of Seasons left a few gaps — some room for improvement — which the second is quick to fill, helping to create a similar enchanting experience and preventing a mass of overly familiar content.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Onions have layers, ogres have layers.\nWithin the Final Fantasy brand, one of the most famous sub-series is the Ivalice Alliance. Set within the fictional land of Ivalice, the handful of projects that comprised these games were marked by their focus on a more grounded setting that explored the dramatic politics of a magical medieval world. However, before Ivalice came along, its creator—Yasumi Matsuno—originally worked on another unrelated series called Ogre Battle that featured an early version of the setting. Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together on the Super NES was the second release in this series and was largely seen as one of the greatest SRPGs ever made, but it never quite garnered the following many believed it deserved. Now nearly 30 years later, Square Enix has decided to give it another crack at finding a broader audience with Tactics Ogre: Reborn, a remake of the PSP remake they made about a decade ago. Though it still shows its age in some ways, Tactics Ogre Reborn does a great job of cleaning up this SRPG classic and presenting it to a new generation.\nTactics Ogre places you in the role of Denam, a Walister teen living under the bootheel of the ruling Galgastani in the wake of a civil war that took place a few decades ago. Sick of living in oppression, Denam ropes his sister and best friend into joining a resistance to overthrow the ruling regime. As more allies join and the resistance escalates into a full-scale war, Denam is tested as he navigates the political and moral landscape while staying true to his original ideals.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The tech experts at Digital Foundry have now had the chance to put the game through its paces (pun very much intended) on the nine different consoles on which it was released so we can now see, from a technical perspective, how the Switch matches up to its competition. In short, not great.\nThe game has had a number of elements removed from it when compared to the other releases, and the overall product suffers because of it. Action stages look \"comparably OK,\" though the decreased resolution (720p dropping to 480p in handheld) and lighting makes things appear \"very blurry\" and lacking in detail.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Graft from the past.\nAtari, and its exuberant founder Nolan Bushnell, were 1970s trailblazers who formed, established, and pioneered the video game industry. Brushing a near-century of mechanical coin-operated gaming aside and barging pinball into a dusty corner, Atari became the focal point of bars everywhere with Pong in 1972. It was the dawning of the digital age, and Bushnell and co. were here to make it fun.\nSometimes we’re in danger of forgetting these facts. The Japanese gaming revolution did so much to build on, perfect, and usurp Atari’s initial endeavours — and in such a gloriously innovative fashion — that we tend to focus our retro gaming goggles somewhere between the mid-'80s to late '90s. It is, of course, generational. For those who grew up with them, there’s still an affection for Clive Sinclair and the early PC gaming boom, the Spectrums, the Commodores, and the Amstrad; the CBS Colecovision, the Vectrex, and the Grandstand console.

Building a PC (or even just swapping out a component) can be a series of lovely little tactile moments: the peeling-off of plastic wrapping, the K’nex-like click of a graphics card slotting into place, the soft whoosh of the fans on a first successful boot. Great stuff, and of course, that’s all before games start coming out of it. What’s not to like?\nOh, reader, so many things. So many, many things not to like. Gaming PCs are still only computers, after all, and computers break, often and for reasons that may be invisible to the most intensively trained eye. Introduce this volatility to a line of work that involves handling a lot of sometimes heavy, usually expensive equipment, and enjoying those little pleasures will eventually come at a cost. Namely, time spent dealing with arcane troubleshooting practices and the occasional spot of minor personal injury.\nRead more",

Billed as a life sim RPG, and with a title that evokes farming, you could be forgiven for expecting something along the lines of Harvest Moon or Stardew Valley, but with more monster biffing. Instead, Harvestella sits firmly in the epic quest camp, with your adventuring being supported by your rural activities.\nAnyone looking to build a pastoral paradise is going to be sorely disappointed, as the farming elements are somewhat rudimentary. Even calling your property a farm is a bit of a stretch. Even after a few upgrades, my plot is more of a large garden, maybe an allotment, if I’m being generous.\nRead more",

It’s something I've been thinking about a lot lately, but I don’t really talk about it. I keep it all inside, like a microwave holding a ball of tin foil while it spins on full power.\nAt least, that was the case until I played Citizen Sleeper. It’s a rather simple RPG inspired by tabletop roleplaying games, giving you a limited number of action dice that you can spend each day to receive consequences. Mechanically, it doesn’t stretch much further than those actions and consequences, meaning I can instead focus on connecting with characters. In its simplicity, I found a cathartic way to process my thoughts on lots of scary stuff happening in our actual world. I also realised that Starfield, the big space game looming on the horizon which I was previously pretty excited about, just doesn’t seem appealing anymore.\nRead more",

          "description": "Say what you will about Square Enix's ill-fated ventures into NFTs and mildly embarrassing follies with live service games recently. Their commitment to remaking, remastering and generally sprucing up their ageing back catalogue from decades past is an admirable one in my eyes, even if they are making you pay through the nose for them almost every single time. As we all know, though, some have made more successful transitions than others. The dream, of course, at least for me, is the Final Fantasy VII Remake approach for literally everything, no matter how unfeasible, impractical or physically impossible that would be for Squeenix's enormous game library. Alas, the reality is often a lot more modest. Best case scenario: you're a 90s SNES game getting a lovely HD-2D makeover like Live A Live. Next on the rung: some added 3D zhuzh a la Final Fantasy VIII Remastered (although even that was by no means perfect). \nMostly, though, it's your Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster treatment. A welcome update that maintains the look of the originals (albeit with some questionable font choices), but that's more or less your lot. Tactics Ogre: Reborn, a remaster of the 2010 PSP remake of the 1995 SNES original, falls squarely into the latter camp, but you know what? That's fine. It's still a rollicking turn-based tactics game all these years later, and one that definitely deserves to be freed from the shackles of Sony's long-dead handheld, where it's lain dormant for the better part of a decade. Besides, I'll take a fully re-orchestrated soundtrack over slightly fancier pixels any day of the week. You know me. \nRead more",

It turns out the guy who owns eight physical copies (and four digital) of the original Resident Evil 4 is still pretty excited to play the remake. Who ever could have predicted this?\n\n\r\nThe day my preview went live, Capcom showed off a couple of additional bits as part of a hefty Resident Evil showcase. Alongside a fresh story trailer the company also discussed the various gubbins you’ll receive if you fork out for the game's special edition as well as a short gameplay demonstration. Surprising no one, I’ve watched these clips so many times I now have a load of thoughts that are not only completely useless but are taking up vital brain space I usually reserve for things like pin numbers and dates. If I don’t vent all of this garbage out of my skull there’s a chance I’ll forget my Mam’s birthday again, something that genuinely happened once when I was 17 and I haven’t stopped feeling guilty about it since. I bought her a plant from a Tesco Express three days later thinking that would help. It didn’t. This event haunts me more than any Resident Evil jumpscare ever could.\r\n\n \nRead more",

You can interpret “full premium release” to mean an actual game that costs $70, or an expansion packaged and sold during the ritually observed Call Of Duty release window. I choose to sit on the fence for the next 12 months, carefully raising one eyebrow so I don’t topple over.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The person died in a hospital bed surrounded by their closest friends and family, and after they've passed on the group begins to share stories and memories from when they were alive. Death isn’t always this calm and it isn’t always this peaceful, but on rare occasions it can be. \nThis is how developers Florian Veltman and Baptiste Portefaix have approached death in How To Say Goodbye, a cosy game that explores the topic with kindness and sensitivity. With its paper doll illustrations and pastel colour palette, it kinda feels like a children's pop-up book that teaches kids about grief. It’s not overly sweet or patronising, just a gentle game about a group of ghosts who discover how to mourn, how to accept their own death, and how to move on.\nRead more",

          "description": "It's been an interesting exercise playing Triangle Strategy and Tactics Ogre: Reborn in quick succession lately. I've now played both Square Enix strategy RPGs for around six hours apiece now - starting with Tactics Ogre for my preview the other week, and following it up with a Triangle-shaped chaser. I didn't have any history with either game before now, but it's become increasingly apparent that they're effectively cut from the same tile-based cloth. And I mean, exactly the same. They're so similar, in fact, that it's kinda hilarious Square are releasing them so close together on PC, with Tactics Ogre's release on November 11th following little more than a month after Triangle Strategy. \nAt the same time, though, their approach to story-telling couldn't be more different, and comparing and contrasting them like this one after the other has been both fun and enlightening. Triangle Strategy, for example, is about 80% cutscene, 20% fighting for its first six hours, while Tactics Ogre is pretty much the opposite. And yet… I think I sort of prefer Triangle Strategy? Let me explain.\nRead more",

So, colour me very excited when I got to spend a good couple of hours battling through two short hands-on demos. I got battered by a big pig, prickled to death by a massive porcupine, and aggressively mauled by a large tiger. And I'd say I had a whale of a time.

RDNA 3 uses a Ryzen CPU-inspired chiplet design, where the GPU is split up into different sections, and the new media engine is engineered for the 4K gaming monitors of the future as much as it is for current PC hardware. \nRead more",

Pulsating lights stretch in a vertical column from the top to the bottom of my screen, scattering into deadly particles like notes played on an accordion of cosmic destruction. Fireworks burst in every corner, thanks to the evolved version of my diamond-spewing runetracer weapon that’s now called ‘NO FUTURE’. Monsters go pop by their thousands. Flaming meteors still abound.\nVampire Survivors is an arcade-style survivathon about weaving through fields of enemies as your weapons automatically obliterate the oncoming hordes. It’s still about collecting upgrades until you’re the locus of an unstoppable death machine, and now that it’s left early access that death machine comes in more colours and more flavours. There are new maps to conquer, new characters to conquer with, and new secrets to uncover. If you haven’t played since the early access launch then yes, it’s worth checking out the new stuff. If you haven’t played at all, then God yes, please check out all the stuff. Or like, most of it.\nVampire Survivors is still morish. Up to a point.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "You had me at \"dark fairytale\"\nWith Stardew Valley being one of my most-beloved and most-played games of all time, I am constantly on the hunt for the next game that can scratch my farming/community simulator itch. There have been quite a few that I've written up over the past few months, and the newest title to add to the list of hopeful successors is the sandbox life sim RPG, Kynseed, which has been described as a \"Stardew Valley-inspired game with 'dark fairytale' creatures.\" Yeah, sign me up.\nThe game has been in early access since November 8, 2018, but it's finally getting its official release on December 6, 2022, as was announced in a newly-dropped release date trailer. Fans who have followed Kynseed all through its development are beyond thrilled to see the game nearing its completed state, as can be seen in the comments sections of its trailers.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4rSiixt_Q\nThe release trailer showcases the usual fare for these kinds of games, like farming, cooking, and fishing, but things really get wild once they dive into the combat. Fighting off monsters looks a lot more intense than the slow-paced combat of Stardew, with more of a strategic, turn-based thing going on. I've really come to appreciate combat mechanics a lot since I had a big Stardew binge a few years ago, so I'll be interested to see how Kynseed's spin on things continues to evolve the simulator genre.\nOh, and did we mention that the developers behind Kynseed are industry veterans from the classic Fable series, now under the new banner of PixelCount Studios. Based on what we know of the game so far, it seems like they've injected this new project with all of the character and whimsy we can expect, so this is definitely one I'm looking forward to checking out on release day.\nThe post Kynseed is a Stardew-like with a “dark fairytale” theme coming this December appeared first on Destructoid.",

The new gameplay can be accessed once the player has completed the \"Bastille\" mission.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbfkLMOqw-o\nCagliostro's Secrets throws a little more heavy metal action in the divine Aegis' path. The DLC includes a new area, Hôpital Saint Louis, which features a new questline and several brand new enemies, along with variants on some of Steelrising's already established mechanical nightmares. In addition, the DLC drop adds five new weapons to our girl's arsenal of death, and includes several brand new side-quests that can be found and completed in Steelrising's other districts.\nWhile Steelrising was not quite the gemstone it might have been, I still found it a gorgeous-looking and very challenging adventure, that rose above its budgetary shortcomings thanks to its classy visuals and in-depth combat mechanics. While certainly not for everyone, the ambitious adventure is a sign that, as a developer, Spiders is growing with each successive release, and I hope that a future sequel could really deliver upon the game's compelling premise.\nSteelrising is available now on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X.\nThe post Delve into Cagliostro’s Secrets in new Steelrising DLC appeared first on Destructoid.",

The studio also released a brand new trailer to get fans' hype engines in gear.\nSet in the lands of Tevinter, Absolution will follow the fable of Miriam, a former elven slave who is forced to throw off her shackles and rise to become the fearsome warrior that she was always destined to be. Across each of the show's six episodes, we will journey with Miriam as she meets a party of noble and ignoble allies, confronting the tragedy of her past and forging a better future for herself, her people, and Tevinter itself. The show will feature the political drama, interpersonal relationships, and epic interspecies warfare that have made BioWare's gaming franchise such an enduring hit with RPG fans.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7MZuR8RM48\nThe six-episode series has been written and produced by showrunner Mairghread Scott, previously responsible for the writing of several animated series within the Marvel Comics, Transformers, and Star Wars universes. Dragon Age: Absolution stars a cast of talented voice actors including Kimberley Brooks Ashley Burch, Phil LaMarr, Matt Mercer, and Sumalee Montano. Hopefully, this fresh dose of olde wurlde action will satiate the fanbase as they wait eagerly for BioWare's to wind up work on the highly anticipated Dragon Age: Dreadwolf, which is currently in development for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X.\nDragon Age: Absolution premieres exclusively on Netflix December 9.\nThe post Will you check out Netflix Dragon Age: Absolution anime? appeared first on Destructoid.",

The Shark is a Guardian that's found on the desert island of Ares, and is exceedingly easy to take down. Here's how.\n\nLocate the Shark Guardian and let it jump out of the sand\nOnce you spot a Shark, Sonic Frontiers will dramatically pause and let you know that the battle has begun with a title card: so there's no way to be completely surprised by its initial strike from under the sand.\nRun in circles around its fin that's poking out, and when it leaps out of the sand, notice the lock-on signature on its tail. Dash toward it as soon as it rises out and latch on with the attack button.\n\nOnce you've grabbed on, follows the on-screen QTEs and then smash it\nFrom there the rest of the fight is self-explanatory.\nSonic will grip the tail of the Shark in a scripted sequence, complete with directional QTEs. Just tilt the analog stick in the direction the game is asking for, and keep going until it crashes.\nOnce it does, it's completely open for combos. If you're fast, you can knock the Shark out quickly. If you don't finish it off (or you fall off), just repeat the process from step one.\nThe post Sonic Frontiers: How to beat Shark Guardians guide appeared first on Destructoid.",

I remember vividly when some parents at the time called it a fad: well, who's laughing now? The Pokemon Company, all the way to the bank.\nOf course, said company likes to take advantage of that nostalgia at any turn, and that includes a brand new interactive digital gallery of the series. You can find the gallery here. Once you're at the landing page, click or tap \"enter,\" and then the text in the white box after reading the terms of use (the text with the link icon will bring you here, to the terms of use page). Then select \"start\" at the bottom of the page.\nOnce you're in, you'll walk through an interactive game of sorts, where you can control a little avatar with a mouse click/tap or the arrow keys. While most of the text is in Japanese, you'll still be able to see dates for releases clearly: as well as installations like the giant Game Boy and the packaging for Pokemon Red and Green. Starters, legendaries, and key Pokemon are part of the exhibit too: and can be clicked on for further investigation (as well as items like the Pokeflute).\nIt's genius timing, as Scarlet and Violet are going to usher in a brand new generation in just a week.\nThe post This official online interactive Pokemon gallery is really cool appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Your gear is king\nThere's a lot of moving parts to God of War Ragnarok, especially in terms of managing stats. Here's a quick rundown on how stats work, and how to buff up your chief upgrades: strength and defense.\n[gallery columns=\"2\" link=\"file\" ids=\"349694,349695\"]\nThe best way to increase your stats is via gear\nWhile you can buff your stats through collectibles found in the open world, you're really going to be getting the bulk of your upgrades through direct gear pieces. That includes traditional armor and weapon upgrades, as well as side items like talismans.\nHere are what stats actually do (directly from the in-game tutorial prompt):\nStrength - Increase damage dealt on all attacks and skills\nDefense - Decrease incoming damage\nRunic - Increase the power of runic attacks and elemental status damage\nVitality - Increase max health, and stagger resistance\nLuck - Gain additional rewards, and activate chance abilities more often\nCooldown - Reduces the wait time for abilities to refresh\nWhen you're playing Ragnarok, it's important to really figure out where your personal strengths and weaknesses lie, controlling Kratos and company. If you're the type of person who plays things really close to the chest, and can parry/block/dodge very easily, focusing on strength would be a smart choice. If you're really reckless and find yourself getting two-shot in even regular encounters, maybe err on the side of defense.\nPersonally, I went with a fully strength build, and min-maxed strength 100% of the time. It served me well throughout the entire game on normal difficulty, and during endgame activities.

The series will depict the coming of the event, alongside the necessary founding of a legion of beast slayers known as \"Witchers\".\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ry6HYg3AsHA\nThe new, four-part series will be headed up by the legendary Michelle Yeoh (Shang-Chi, Everything Everywhere All at Once) as the formidable sword-elf Scian. Yeoh will be joined by Jodie Turner-Smith (Anne Boelyn, True Blood) as the highly-skilled Queen's guard officer Éile, and Laurence O'Fuarain (Game of Thrones, Vikings) as the redemption-seeking warrior Fjall. The cast is rounded out by Mirren Mack, Zach Wyatt, and Jacob-Collins Levy.\nThe Witcher: Blood Origin will offer up an original story, set within the same universe as the games and original novels but telling a tale of new characters and events. The show will precede the arrival of the fourth season of The Witcher, which will see Liam Hemsworth take up the dual swords of Geralt of Rivia, donning the well-worn scabbard of departing actor Henry Cavill.\nThe Witcher: Blood Origin premieres December 25 exclusively on Netflix.\nThe post Check out the trailer for Netflix prequel The Witcher: Blood Origin appeared first on Destructoid.",

If you look on the right: those are fishing tokens (which can be used in the fishing minigame). If you look on the left of the bar: those are starfall meteor pieces, which you'll pick up by running around the map during the starfall event itself. Those fuel the roulette wheel, which will randomly spin while you're playing and earn you more tokens.\nThat's it! Just run around like a maniac and earn more tokens. While doing so, you'll likely encounter portions of the map you haven't been to yet.\nThe post Sonic Frontiers: How to play the starfall slot machine minigame guide appeared first on Destructoid.",

Just press X/A to confirm it and you're good to go. It'll drop you in the focal point of the island (typically where you start after first visiting it).\n\nFast traveling via scrolls from fishing\nIf you want to get around each island individually, you'll need to put in a bit of work.\nFast travel within islands is done via scrolls, which are acquired from the fishing minigame. They're randomly doled out, and allow you to travel to the Elder Koco and Hermit Koco NPCs (the main skill-up and respec characters). Just keep fishing until you find scrolls, and it'll unlock.\nWe have a full guide on the fishing minigame here!\nThe post Sonic Frontiers: How to fast travel across the map appeared first on Destructoid.",

We wanted to create something new. Something different and unexpected. A world like no other. Thank you, the audience, for making Control such a success for us,\" writes game director Mikael Kasurinen on the Remedy Entertainment website.\n\"With Control 2, we’ll take another leap into the unknown. It’ll be an unexpected journey. It’ll take a while, but to put it mildly, this is the most exciting project I’ve ever worked on. It’s still early days, but it will be worth the wait.\"\n\n505 Games also spoke of its excitement to work on the reality-breaking new project.\n\"We are excited to deepen our cooperation with Remedy and continue the success story of Control together. Since its launch in 2019, Control has sold over three million copies,\" said 505 Games co-CEOs Rami and Raffi Galante. \"Control is the biggest investment 505 Games has ever made, so it has a special place in our hearts. We are grateful to the whole player community that has made Control such a long-lasting and loved game, and are even more excited to bring out Control 2.\"\nWhile details are non-existent regarding the sequel's narrative, the companies announced that the sequel would be developed for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X, utilizing Remedy’s \"Northlight\" engine to create its dimension-splitting worlds. Remedy will be charged with publishing duties on console platforms, while 505 Games will handle marketing/release on PC. Control 2 is clearly in its very early concept stages, so it is unlikely that we'll be seeing anything of the project within the coming year.\nControl 2 is currently in development at Remedy Entertainment and 505 Games.\nThe post Control 2 officially announced by Remedy and 505 Games appeared first on Destructoid.",

Once the player has selected their team of choice, they will engage in a weekend of incredibly sticky online competition — bagging points for their chosen team in a bid to prove which of these is the best Pokemon element of them all...\n...That's best starter Pokemon element.

All participants will receive fun, in-game items, with bonus goodies going to players on the winning side. The action kicks off today, November 11 at 16:00 PT / 19:00 ET / 00:00 BST with the final whistle being blown at the same times on Sunday, November 13. You can pledge for your team in Inkopolis Square.\nAs y'all know, I covered pretty much every single splatfest — its topics, commentary, winners, and running score — over the course of Splatoon 2's long lifespan. And, I have to admit, it's just not the same with my girls Pearl & Marina. Still, there is plenty of fun to be had for Squid Kids and Octolings, so get out there and make your mark.

Back when the genre was fledgling, there were a lot of frontiers to push into, whereas now, most things have been explored. The course many developers have now taken is just to make things more bombastic. Bloodier, explodier, more swear words! All this while reminding you what we lost when the FPS started chasing that Half-Life success.\nThe problem with this is that the genre’s resurgence has been swamped. I’ve watched groups of trailers and had difficulty telling the difference in some titles. I love retro shooters, but it’s hard to pick one to try when they’re all trying to sell me on the same points. Also, they often release into Early Access.\nCultic isn’t really an Early Access title.…",

Along the way, the rookie will team with, (or oppose), a who's who of 30 genuine pro-wrestling legends, including \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage, Koko B. Ware, Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts, The Road Warriors, Sgt. Slaughter, and Andre the Giant.\nAlso, Jeff Jarrett is in the mix.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtpjlXOviKA\nWrestleQuest incorporates fun pixel visuals, as well as a novel \"Hasbro figure\" look to each of its ring legends. As you can see from the above trailer, matches play out in turn-based fashion, with a wide variety of strikes, holds, throws, and specials available to our roster of ring-rockers. One gal even shows up on a motorbike, which might be considered cheating, all things considered. Another fun moment sees Andre show up to bodyslam the entire ring! Good work, boss.\nAs the player progresses through their star-spangled career, they will be given the option to customize their wardrobe, gimmick, and entrance to ensure that they become the talk of the town... or at least The Observer. With its tongue firmly stuck in its cheek, and some rad-looking visual design. I'm definitely looking forward to seeing whether this underdog delivers a five-and-a-half star matchup when it finally emerges from the locker room.\nAdd Bull Nakano and this is going to be my GOTY 2023.\nWrestleQuest launches May 2023 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.\nThe post WrestleQuest brings macho madness to PC and consoles May 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Once activated, Dynamic mode will literally allow players to mash attack buttons and have those random presses transformed into useful maneuvers.\nYou can check out the feature in the video below, courtesy of Game Informer.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkRXTVd51dE\nNow, of course, while Modern controls already offer up something of a gateway to newer players, Dynamic is truly for beginners, youngsters, and those who just want to smash buttons and hope for the best. It also fits in as another addition to the sequel's impressive list of accessibility options. As such, the mode will be locked to local play only, and will not be a viable option for online matches. It's another fine addition to the overall Street Fighter 6 package, which continues to impress month by month with its myriad modes, options, and attention to the small details.\nA Capcom employee once told me that a key goal of the SF6 team was to deliver a game that felt \"full\" at launch. So far, they're doing a magnificent job at sticking to that idiom.\nStreet Fighter 6 launches 2023 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. You can also catch up on previous episodes by visiting our new Game Informer Shows YouTube channel. \nMetal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. \nWatch on Twitch!\nJoin me, Marcus Stewart, and Blake Hester as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure.

          "description": "Remedy Entertainment has announced a new deal with publisher 505 Games to co-develop and market Control 2. The news also provided insight into the sequel's development status. \nAccording to a press release, Control 2 (once known as Codename Heron) is currently in the concept phase, being built in Remedy’s proprietary Northlight engine. The game will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Remedy will publish the PC version while 505 will handle the game’s console releases. Control 2 has no release window, but Remedy did release a piece of concept art, posted below. \nThe press release also states that Control 2’s development budget initially sat at 50 million euros. Remedy and 505 will equally split marketing and development costs, as well as revenue generated by its release. Remedy retains full ownership of the Control IP, however. The press release also reveals that the first Control has sold over 3 million copies since launching in 2019. \n“We are excited to deepen our cooperation with Remedy and continue the success story of Control together,” say Rami and Raffi Galante, co-CEOs of Digital Bros Group/505 Games. “... Control is the biggest investment 505 Games has ever made, so it has a special place in our hearts. We are grateful to the whole player community that has made Control such a long-lasting and loved game, and are even more excited to bring out Control 2.”\nThis announcement was first teased last June, when Remedy and 505 revealed plans for new triple-A Control experiences. That same update revealed an upcoming multiplayer spin-off title known as Project Condor. Earlier this year, Remedy also struck a deal with Rockstar to develop remakes of Max Payne 1 and 2.",

A new trailer provides a deeper look into the adult animated series' premise and new heroes. \nThe story centers on Miriam, an elven mercenary and former slave tasked with stealing a powerful and dangerous artifact. When the heist goes awry, the situation escalates into a larger fight for survival for Miriam and her friends. Set in Tevinter, the show features an original cast of heroes and, potentially, some old favorites (the characters at 0:45 look a lot like Cassandra and Leliana). Check out the trailer below. \n\n\nFirst announced during Netflix Geeked Week in June, Dragon Age: Absolution’s cast includes Kimberly Brooks (Miriam), Matthew Mercer (Fairbanks), Ashly Burch (Qwydion), Phil Lamarr (Roland), and Josh Keaton (Rezaren). The series consists of six 30-minute episodes. \nThough steeped in Dragon Age lore, it remains to be seen if the show has any connection to the upcoming Dragon Age: Dreadwolf. Absolution is far from the only video game adaptation Netflix has in the works. The CG-animated Sonic Prime also premieres in December. The streaming giant also announced a live-action Gears of War movie and its own animated series.",

Eligible hardware includes:\nStadia Controller\nFounder's Edition\nPremiere Edition\nPlay and Watch with Google TV packages\nStadia Pro subscriptions will not be refunded, but members can play their Pro titles until the shutdown. However, those who purchased a subscription on or after September 29, 2022, and were charged for it will have that money returned. \nRefunds will be issued to the form of payment used to make the purchase. If that account is no longer available, Google will send an email with instructions for setting up an alternative method of receiving the refund.\nUsers may have already received an email notifying them of their refund status.

We spoke with Williams about why God of War 2018's director, Cory Barlog, had to convince him to take on the role, why nearly every God of War game has a new director, how he discovered he is not able to generate visuals in his mind's eye, how the surprising casting of Richard Schiff as Odin came about, and plenty more.

          "description": "The original Dungeons & Dragons RPG grew out of a connection to miniature wargames, so it’s little surprise that the DNA of tactical tabletop play has remained bound to the long-running franchise ever since. The current edition of D&D supports tremendous flexibility in playing out combat how you like, including through tabletop miniature play, allowing big battles to flow out from ongoing campaign storylines in your weekly sessions. However, perhaps your group is more into combat than interconnected storylines. Or, more likely, you sometimes just want a break from the campaign planning to have a focused evening of combat. If that’s the case, WizKids’ new Dungeons & Dragons: Onslaught game should be on your radar. \nIn recent weeks, I had the good fortune to look at what Onslaught has in sto…",

The studio has been quite open with its accessibility desires, detailing more than 60 in a blog post earlier this year. Now, with the game out on November 9, the studio has released an even more detailed post breaking down exactly what to expect. \n\n\nSanta Monica Studio says there are more than 70 features in Ragnarok that \"enable players to customize the gameplay experience to suit their needs\" and the list is a sight to behold. It includes plenty of presets, too, which could make it easier for players to easily get the game started in a way that makes the experience better for them. Presets include one for vision accessibility, hearing accessibility, motion reduction, apply motor accessibility, and a changed setting indicator as well. \nThere are alternative control schemes, remappable buttons, hold and press options, in-game assistance settings, and so much more. If you're interested in what accessibility features are in Ragnarok, be sure to check out the full blog post. \nFor more, read Game Informer's God of War Ragnarok review and then check out all of the performance and quality modes for the game. \nWhich accessibility features do you find most helpful in games?

As for why, she says the working dynamic with the game's audio director has become difficult and she sees no path forward. Variety reports that the audio director in question is Stephen Miller but Schachner doesn't name this person in her announcement. \nNews of her departure comes from a statement released by Schachner on Twitter on November 3, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. Schachner's departure comes after years of work with Modern Warfare II studio Infinity Ward on games like 2019's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and 2016's Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare. Other credits include Assassin's Creed Valhalla and Anthem, as noted by VGC. \n\"I am sad to say I can no longer continue to compose music for MWII/Warzone,\" her statement reads. \"Over the past couple of months, the working dynamic with the audio director has become increasingly challenging and I don't see any path forward. As of now, I am unsure of the status and release plan for the soundtrack as it's been taken out of my hands. While I don't have any control over how the music is presented in-game, what will be released on the soundtrack is not my artistic intent in regards to mixing and mastering.\" \nShe then thanks fans for their support and gives some shout outs to others involved with the game's score, including mixer Frank Wolf, \"creative vision\" Mike Dean, and performing artists including Baseck, Brain Mantia, and M.B. Gordy.\nYou can read her full statement below: \nMany of you have been asking about the MWII soundtrack release.\npic.twitter.com/UEqgpCTjUg\nNovember 3, 2022\nFor more, read Game Informer's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II review. \n[Source: Video Games Chronicle]\nWhat are your thoughts on the score of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II?

          "description": "Ubisoft has rolled out its post-launch content roadmap for Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope. Owners of the game’s season pass, whether purchased separately for $29.99 or bundled in the game’s $89.99 Gold Edition, have three big adventures aimed at keeping them glued to the game throughout 2023. \nIt all kicks off early next year with the first expansion, Tower of Doooom (their spelling, not mine). This introduces a new combat mode where the team must fight their way up Madame Bwahstrella’s multi-story tower to rescue Spawny, the visor-rocking Rabbid from Kingdom Battle. What’s important to note is that Tower of Doooom will be exclusive to the season pass, meaning you’ll be unable to purchase it separately. \nThe second untitled DLC arrives in mid-2023. So far, we only know it takes players to a new planet, features never-before-seen enemies, allies, and secrets, and stars a new antagonist. Finally, Rayman crashes the party in the final expansion to close out the year. Ubisoft’s limbless hero joins Rabbid Peach and Rabbid Mario on a separate adventure in a new location. Unlike Tower of Doooom, the second and third expansions can be purchased a la carte. \nI enjoyed Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope quite a bit, awarding it a 9 out of 10. In my review, which you can read here, I wrote that the game “builds upon Kingdom Battle’s foundation with smart tweaks and fun additions to emerge as a better game in every way.”",

Not long after the reveal, speculation that Abandoned was actually a Silent Hill game secretly in development began to ramp up, but studio head Hasan Kahraman took to Twitter to shut down those rumors.\nFrom there, the speculation train arrived at the idea that famed Metal Gear Solid developer Kojima was attached to the game.

          "description": "Atomic Heart, the BioShock-esque shooter set in an alternate reality's Soviet Union, will be released this February. \nMore specifically, the game will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on February 21, 2023. Developer Mundfish and publisher Focus Entertainment announced this news in a new and bloody gameplay trailer showcasing more of what to expect in the game early next year. \nCheck out the Atomic Heart release date trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Atomic Heart continues to look great in trailers and I can't wait to finally go hands-on with it in just four months, especially as a fan of BioShock. While Atomic Heart is doing its own thing, it's hard not to compare it to the BioShock series given the whole alternate reality thing, the types of guns on display here, the enemies we'll be facing, and the hand-controlled powers. \nAtomic Heart was revealed years ago, and there are plenty more trailers to watch if you're interested. Check out this 2020 gameplay trailer for an early look at the game, and then watch this 2021 trailer for a look at the creepier side of Atomic Heart. Find out why it's one of our most anticipated horror games after that, and then watch this action-packed combat trailer from earlier this summer. \nFor additional information about Atomic Heart, be sure to check out Mundfish's official website, where there's info about the game's different editions available for preorder and more. \nAre you excited about Atomic Heart?

          "description": "According to a Bloomberg report, video game publisher Embracer has shut down Onoma, the studio formerly known as Square Enix Montreal, just months after its acquisition. Some staff will be transferred to Eidos Montreal, another studio owned by Embracer. This news comes just a few weeks after Onoma underwent a rebranding process where it adopted the new name.\nOnoma was best known for its work on the Go series, turn-based spin-offs of popular Eidos Interactive titles designed for mobile. This includes Hitman Go, Lara Croft Go, and Deus Ex Go. Their most recent work was Tomb Raider Reloaded, which came to mobile devices earlier this year, and their future plans involved a title based on Avatar: The Last Airbender.\nEarlier this year, Onoma was just one part of a much larger series of Embracer’s acquisitions, which included Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montreal. In August, Embracer proceeded to acquire Limited Run Games, Tripwire Interactive, Tuxedo Labs, the IP rights to The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, and several more studios.\nThe Bloomberg report also says that the closure is part of a cost-cutting initiative, and that Eidos Montreal will have projects scaled back and cut as well. Some of these resources will be redirected to assist in the development of a game in the Fable franchise, led by Playground Games.\n[Source: Bloomberg]\nWere you a fan of the Go series? Do you think acquisitions are good for the games industry? Let us know in the comments.",

          "description": "The official Sonic the Hedgehog YouTube channel has uploaded an animated short titled “Sonic Frontiers Prologue: Divergence.” Starring Knuckles, the short reveals how he wound up on the island players explore in Sonic Frontiers. You can watch the six-minute animation in its entirety below.\n\n\nIn the trailer, Knuckles provides a voice-over explanation of his background up until now, including the fact that he was tasked with guarding the Master Emerald, a relic that hasn’t appeared in the Sonic series for quite some time. The trailer ends with Knuckles absolutely demolishing some robots, and while we’ve received no indication that he will be playable in Sonic Frontiers, that sequence makes me hope he will be.\nKnuckles has been a core Sonic character for most of the franchise’s existence, so it’s not surprising that he’s making an appearance in the blue blur’s latest adventure. While this animated prologue gives us insight into how he wound up on the island, it’s still not entirely clear why, especially when it comes to the appearance of Sage (a new character introduced in Sonic Frontiers) at the end of the trailer. We’ll have to wait for the full game to find out.\nThe past month has been full of Sonic news. We got a December 14 release date for Sonic Prime, Sonic Frontiers got a trailer confirming Super Sonic would be playable in the game, and we learned that the Sonic series has sold over 1.5 billion copies worldwide. For more Sonic news, check out our cover story from earlier this year, and stay tuned for more Sonic Frontiers coverage when the game releases on November 8.",

The news was announced through a blog post on the Spry Fox website, which also answers some questions about the future of the studio.\nSpry Fox says the partnership will not change any of their upcoming plans, meaning that Cozy Grove 2 and their unnamed non-violent MMO will still be developed as planned. Instead, Netflix will provide them with financial support, which Spry Fox says will allow them to “stop stressing” about how their games will generate profit. Despite all of Netflix’s current games existing through their mobile app, the blog post does not mention anything about platform exclusivity.\nSpry Fox joins five other in-house game developers at Netflix: Next Games (Stranger Things: Puzzle Tales), Night School Studio (Oxenfree), Boss Fight Entertainment (Dungeon Boss), and two internal studios in Helsinki, Finland and southern California.\nNetflix launched its games collection just over a year ago, in November of 2021. Currently, subscribers can play over 30 games on their mobile app, including Into the Breach, Spiritfarer, and Poinpy. On top of that, Netflix has over 50 more games in development.

That was a vaguely defined arrangement at the time, but we now know the partnership will produce a minimum of three titles.\nEA announced the news in a press release, with the publisher describing it as a “long-term” deal that could extend beyond three games based on the wording. The release also specifies these titles will be action-adventure games for consoles and PC, each featuring original stories in the Marvel universe. \nIt's worth clarifying that EA is not getting exclusive rights to Marvel like it had with Star Wars. There are multiple Marvel games in the works at various studios, including the recently announced Captain America/Black Panther game from Amy Hennig’s Skydance New Media. \n“We have been long-time fans of Marvel and their impressive leadership, so this is a remarkable moment for our developers as well as our players and fans,” said EA COO Laura Miele. “We look forward to welcoming Marvel into the EA family of creators and know this collaboration will produce exceptional experiences for our players. We can’t wait to see players' reactions when they suit up as Iron Man and do the extraordinary things this Super Hero is known for.”\nWe’re curious to learn what other Marvel projects are on the docket and which EA studios are behind them. Motive’s Iron Man, a single-player third-person action game, is currently in pre-production, so it’s a long way from release (the team is also making the Dead Space remake).
