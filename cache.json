Zero Fire, a portmanteau of collected titles Zero Wing (1989) and Hellfire (1989) represents Toaplan during the height of its glorious arcade tenure.\nAlthough released just four months apart, Hellfire is chronologically the first in this collection, a side-on horizontal scrolling shoot 'em up that was borne from the instruction to make a game like Konami’s Gradius. Hellfire was the company’s first horizontal foray, and its production was particularly problematic. Director Tatsuya Uemura cited it as being “extremely difficult to make” in an interview for the Toaplan Shooting Chronicle, a music collection, and that it was memorable only for the struggle he and his team experienced during its manufacture.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Sea of low-quality.\nIt's difficult now to remember a time when the Switch eShop wasn't rammed with low-cost, low-quality games making it laborious to find the great new releases amongst all the dross. What began as an immaculately clean, functional store back in 2017 quickly ballooned and before long Nintendo was inundated with software submissions vying for visibility on a crowded digital marketplace. Inevitably, these included titles from less-than-scrupulous developers and publishers looking to make a quick buck.\nIn recent months, the number of quick-and-dirty 'clone' games seems to have exploded, though. The Last Hope - Dead Zone Survival is a notable example which is no longer on the eShop after it caught the attention of Sony's copyright lawyers. That was an open-close case, perhaps, but the underhand tactics being employed by select publishers make a handful of PC-based bullshots look like quaint, small-fry false advertising.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

I think I'll be the first to break free from its metaphorical chains because I played it for review, but I'm still puttering about trying to take the roads I un-taked the first time.

Its colourful visuals and contrasting colour palette cast its deep caverns and sun-drenched mountains in a beautiful, but eerie kind of light, and its strange, scuttling creatures put me in the mind of the night horrors from Dredge and Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet. But its central premise of you being a headless body carting round an inflatable head to presumably escape to goodness knows where isn't quite the breath of fresh air I hoped it would be. \nRead more",

In a pre-reveal showcase attended by RPS, producer Andreas Schmiedecker walked us through a few sections of this atypically green-fingered open world shooter.\nIn Outcast: ANB you play a growly-gruff ex-Navy SEAL, the sleekly named Cutter Slade, who roves a planet called Adelpha using a fancy jetpack. You're here to help the indigenous Talans - who definitely hail from the Ewoky end of the ethnic representation scale - fight off an army of robot invaders. The jetpack is the initial star attraction: it lets you boost, glide and dash through colourful landscapes inspired by 80s and 90s movies and comics. The associated animations seem a bit wooden to me: I often felt like I was watching somebody steer a man-shaped cursor, rather than a body in flight. But I certainly can't argue with the verticality and agility on display.\nRead more",

I admit, I was a little piqued by Homeworld 3's redesigned Mothership, which lies flat as a doormat - an act of blasphemy akin to flipping a crucifix upside down, or wearing a baseball cap backwards in your 50s.

At the time of writing, the game has attracted 22,619 reviews, many written by people who've already been playing for a while on Battle.net, of which just 15% give the game a thumbs-up, making for an \"Overwhelmingly Negative\" rating. Tucked in amongst the usual troll reviews, cheeky links to Team Fortress 2 and dubious ASCII jokes there are some rather extensive essays on the game's direction and faults.\r\n\n\r\nMany players still have axes to grind about Overwatch 2's switch to a free-to-play battle pass model - check out our launch-day Overwatch 2 review for the nitty gritty - which introduced levelling for new characters and cosmetics to a game that once handed you its entire roster almost without caveats, and encouraged you to experiment freely. Others are angry about Overwatch 2's story-driven PVE modes, the supposed focus of the sequel - announced as a full-blown Hero Missions mode with skill trees and levelling, then dramatically stripped back to a series of separately sold seasonal co-op missions, much as with Halloween events in the first Overwatch. There are complaints about Blizzard's recent handling of the Overwatch League, and more subjective quibbles about the switch to a 5v5 team format and the precise ratio of DPS to Support heroes. A few reviews touch on Activision-Blizzard's alleged culture of sexual harassment and claims of unfair labour practices, which make Overwatch's emphasis on team spirit ring rather hollow.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I recall being introduced to it at a covert LAN party in a school IT room, plonking myself down at a monitor and instantly being reduced to a fine red mist (and in the game, etc). The singleplayer campaign had you scrapping across a muddy alien world with shotgun and hyperblaster, with larger levels than in the original Quake, and missions where you'd use heads as keys.\nRead more",

          "description": "Had you asked me yesterday about the best Baldur's Gate 3 class, I might have picked Bard - versatile, swish, a solid support both in and out of combat - but that was before I discovered the ancient and honourable Larian discipline of barrelmancy. As the name suggests, it's all about doing mildly game-breaking things with barrels, crates and other heavy containers, by taking advantage of high strength, the Throw command, and the fact that Larian RPG characters can somehow fit items as big as they are into their inventories, without bursting apart like rotten haggis.\nA straightforward tactic: consider lugging a few oil barrels into a throne room, and dropping them all around the resident big cheese before you confront him. Given reasonably careful distribution, it's possible to finish a whole battle this way in a single turn. Fortunately, while Baldur's Gate NPCs can be eagle-eyed when it comes to sneaking rogues, they're perfectly indifferent to people surrounding them with heavy explosives.\nRead more",

The major things I am given to understand about it are that it is very confusing, sexy in a ghoulish way, and 100% comprised of memes in the same way that Hamlet has retrospectively become a book's worth of quotations.\nI have, however, played a surprising number of very decent games that are influenced by Twin Peaks - Zelda: Link's Awakening, Silent Hill and the amazing Lone Survivor, to pick a few that I know about for sure.

It takes the Soulslike credentials of the original, gives them a grittier makeover, a much bigger world, and a magical lantern that reveals a gnarlier version of the universe you can actually step into.\nHaving spent roughly 90-minutes with the game, I'd say it has strong Dark Souls 2 energy mixed with a realm-hopping gimmick that's surprisingly impressive. While it's definitely too early to make big claims, I could see LOTF as a genuine competitor in the saturated Soulslike arena.\nRead more",

          "description": "I've been bolting together some ideas for a longer Starfield feature and while plying the sliplanes of Reddit, stumbled on this conversation about the game's handling of time. As many of you will know/be very weary of hearing, Starfield features hundreds of planets, together with moons and space stations, scattered around the galaxy in different solar systems. Real-life planets, of course, aren't fixed points: they rotate and orbit their stars at different speeds, depending on their mass and distance, which means that days, nights and seasons have different durations. \r\n\n\r\nStarfield appears to model this to some degree. Bethesda's Starfield Direct from June makes a fleeting distinction (thanks, JuiceHead33) between \"local time\", corresponding to where you land on a planet's surface, and \"UT\", which sounds like an abbreviation of \"universal time\", and presumably describes the passage of time throughout the wider galaxy. Both are displayed in 24 hour format. You can explore planet locations at different local times, as indicated by your fancy neo-Casio watch, with shifting lighting conditions that seem to correspond to the spinning of the planet around its sun. There's footage showing one particular area, The Hitching Post in Akila City, by day and night. The game also seems to model planetary alignments - there's the beginnings of a solar eclipse visible during one segment of the video.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Obviously, this means Stray Gods has some top-notch voice talent on board, but these casting choices also make another kind of sense. The premise of this 'roleplaying musical' is inspired by the Buffy the Vampire episode 'Once More With Feeling', you see, and as in that piece of classic TV, part of the appeal is seeing (or hearing) performers who famously earn a crust in more action-oriented roles forced to prove their singing chops instead.\nThankfully, The Last Of Us crew all have a finely tuned set of pipes on them, not least Bailey, and the notes they belt out absolutely do this game’s charming and entertaining concept justice. Even better, they’re ably backed by the admirable composing skills of Austin Wintory, a fizzy script and pitch-perfect character design.\nRead more",

I'd played this bit before in early access, so I knew to fireball the tiny bit of rope to drop the big stone down into the floor and take out the rest of the bandits hanging about up there pretty sharpish. But before I went down beneath the chapel (there were a lot of other nasty bandits down there last time I checked), I had a little extra nose around the outside, eventually discovering a locked hatch down a nearby cliff path that took me to the brilliantly named Dank Crypt.\nSensing not all was well down here, I went into hiding mode and gingerly crept around the place, looting the handful of corpses lying about of their gold and spell scrolls, but leaving their weapons. You see, I have a terrible habit in RPGs of stuffing my pockets with absolutely everything I can find. In Bioshock, I will scavenge everything out of every bin like some feral raccoon; in Skyrim, I had to enable a cheat code for infinite storage one time because I was so overencumbered (and couldn't bear to part with everything I'd picked up over the course of the quest) that I actually couldn't move. And in my early hours of Baldur's Gate 3, I started doing exactly the same thing, looting everyone's swords, daggers and crossbows up on the Nautiloid. Not to much effect, mind. Nothing was really that much better than what I already had. So I resolved to do better and resist temptation. And what a dumb idea that turned out to be... \nRead more",

Well, some of us like to think of ourselves as serious journalists, thank you very much, so I'd like to call your attention to the, dare I say, more grown-up elements of the patch, which range from fine-tuning the tooltips to making dragons appear in the right place.\r\n\n\r\nTear your eyes from those lurid details of absentee knickers and glitchy sausages, and you'll see that Larian has fixed no less than 13 crash bugs and progress blockers, though sadly not the crash bug I always seem to get when I run the game in DirectX 11. They've also sorted out an issue with enemies entering combat when they're on a different floor, together with the occasional odd prolonged silence in over 200 dialogues, and a smattering of minor issues with cameras and clipping. See, this is the stuff video game news is rightly made of. None of your adolescent leering, thanks.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "You might already know that first-person fantasy RPG Avowed began life as Obsidian's take on Skyrim, but did you know that it was originally pushed as a multiplayer game, prior to being acquired by Microsoft? That's according to studio head and founder Feargus Urquhart, speaking in the latest and final episode of the Obsidian 20th Anniversary documentary, which is chock-a-block with intriguing factoids from throughout the studio's history.\r\n\n\r\n\"One of the things I really pushed was that Avowed was going to be multiplayer,\" Urquhart said. \"And I kept on that for a long time. And I think in the end - not 'I think', I know, in the end, it was the wrong decision to keep on pushing on it. Now [the reason I did it] was when we still independent and we were selling it, it was a more interesting game to publishers. And when you're asking for $50, $60, $70, $80 million, you have to have something interesting to talk about. And multiplayer made it interesting. It was this idea of sort of the peanut butter and chocolate, putting it together - it must be something that's good.\"\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Rockstar's original Red Dead Redemption can seem rather humble next to the rootin' tootin' excellence of Red Dead Redemption 2, but it looms larger in my memory, albeit not for the best reasons. The original Xbox 360/PS3 game launched with a tidal wave of bugs, some of them game-ending. One particular collection of technical gremlins trapped me on a farm during the prologue. Having sat through some cutscenes, I found myself at the centre of a strange spacetime distortion redolent of the other world in Neil Gaiman's Coraline. If I tried to leave the farm the simulation slowly broke down, with movement consisting of weird fragmentary teleports. \nI saw a distant rider stop-starting through a canyon with his own hat darting through the air behind him. I followed the man for as long as I could, before tumbling through the terrain into uncreated space. Proper Lynchian stuff. Red Dead Redemption 2 had its share of bugs and glitches, but none of them quite as captivating as this. Still, it would have been nice to see the world beyond the farm, and that was my first thought when Take-Two Interactive and Rockstar announced a new Red Dead Redemption port, for release on 17th August. Sadly, however, the port appears to be PS4 and Switch-only for the moment, though a PC release might happen if the stars align.\nRead more",

There's only so many times you can do that dance of shieldwalls before it loses its charm.

I've just discovered the finer applications of Mage Hands, which are a great antidote to goblin archers - simply spawn one behind the offender, use it to hurl them from the cliff they're standing on, and chuck a nearby crate after them for good measure. Magical indeed! Or so I thought, before I read about the real spells that lurk at the top of the level-up ladder in the D&D player handbook. \nThese feats of wizardry make Mage Handing seem about as otherworldly as setting an alarm clock. Take Wish, a ninth level conjuration that allows you to \"alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires\", up to and including generating pricey equipment from nothing and rewinding time. Or how about Prismatic Wall, which spawns an ephemeral barrier 90-feet long, made up of seven layers that inflict a different effect on any creature passing through, from poison to petrification? Spicy enough for you, goblin archers? Sadly, it doesn't sound like either of these spells is hidden away anywhere in Baldur's Gate 3, which caps progression at level 12. And it's far from certain that they'll be added in the shape of an expansion pack. There's a good reason for this: higher level D&D spells and abilities are so potent it's hard to include them without turning Baldur's Gate 3 characters into gods.\nRead more",

And also every single one of those misfit heroes wants to get at you. In many cases with zero prompting from you whatsoever. It doesn't end with your team companions either; by my loose estimations, any character who is in upwards of three cutscenes comes with a 70% chance of propositioning you. There's one romance option that I experienced effectively as a jump scare, entering a cutscene to see a character suddenly and casually-not-casually shirtless. It never ends.

I cracked a fresh save over the weekend, having bid a sad goodbye to my early access Tiefling rogue, and I already know what I’d like from the game’s modding scene, or preferably, a forthcoming official update. No, it isn’t new races, or increased party sizes, or the removal of the weight limit (which you can get around by offloading spare loot to your Tardis-esque interdimensional campsite). What I’d like most is the ability to switch between characters during dialogue. You’ll trigger many of these conversations without warning as you explore the world, and I routinely bumble into chitchats the character I’m controlling isn’t quite prepped for.\nRead more",

Most of us who were knocking around the internet in the early 00s will have at least one online gravestone in the closet somewhere, whether it's a long abandoned LiveJournal or MySpace page, or an old internet forum that sadly doesn't exist anymore (RPS in peace). But for the citizens of Videoverse, an online community that's part and parcel of the soon to be defunct 1-bit video games console the Kinmoku Shark, this sense of an ending is something that many of them aren't equipped to deal with, least of all teenager Emmett, who's just discovered the fan page for his favourite video game, Feudal Fantasy. \nAs he deals with the prospect of having to bid farewell to friends old and new, including the mysterious but talented fan artist Vivi, Videoverse taps into a potent and nostalgic melancholy. It's a love letter to the early internet at its rose-tinted best, and to the lost, formative spaces that brought so many like-minded individuals together and gave them a sense of purpose. Yes, there are trolls spoiling everyone's fun, and yes, there's a hint of something more nefarious going on underneath Videoverse's source code. But another Hypnospace Outlaw this is not. Rather, this is a proto-internet tale that's all about the friendships we form online, and the bonds that carry us forward when real-life relationships just don't cut it anymore.\nRead more",

I could say the VR launch cupboard is a little bare at the moment, with Steam's New Releases list offering up a lot of dour military shooters, dubious Early Access projects, and fantasy dismemberment porn. I could say that The Room VR: A Dark Matter has just received a PSVR2 release, so now seems an opportune moment to revisit this acclaimed spin-off puzzler. I could say that The Room VR is the only entry in the series RPS hasn't covered yet. But to be perfectly honest, I just fancied playing The Room VR. So there.\r\n\n\r\nOh all right, there was a slightly more specific reason why I wanted to revisit a game that came out just three days after Half-Life: Alyx. Upon its launch, there wasn't much else like The Room on VR devices, a dedicated puzzler with high production values that didn't feel the need to throw in a gun to shoot or a melon to chop. Now, there are bunch of fantastic VR brain-ticklers swimming in the pond, such as the time-travelling epic Wanderer, the perspective-bending A Fisherman's Tale series, and the ingenious automation extravaganza The Last Clockwinder. \r\n\n \nRead more",

I quit playing Frank And Drake twice before even meeting its second protagonist, but something about it kept pulling me back.\r\n\nIt's partly the style. Some gorgeous rotoscoping gives its few characters a sense of constant motion that's unreal and very lifelike at once, and it's sometimes pushed further by having them decelerate to a blurred freeze frame when you stop walking. The backgrounds are static but interactable things shimmer a bit, like in old cartoons where you could always tell what was background and what was going to do something. More than that, though, it had me intrigued.\nRead more",

I'm not gonna lie, a tiny part of me died inside upon hearing this, simply because of its sheer (not a pun), unadultered brilliance.

And I've started off strong, having created an awful little guy.\nLet me introduce you to Edders Sheeran, the bard. On the surface he seems like a cheerful sprite, ready to pat his little drum and have everyone do a nice little dance. Truthfully, he is a psychopath who suppresses the urge to kill, thanks to a malevolent background choice that most would leave for a second playthrough, so as he plays Shape Of You, he also imagines the Shape Of You Dead.\nRead more",

Kaput, in about an hour.

But the update’s called Smokin’ Hot because it makes all the guys in the game, well, smokin’ hot - if you're into men with a Gears Of War workout routine, that is. Following the revamped female character models last year, developer Gamepires continue their early access tour with a refresh for every male character in the game which may or may not include a touch up for the Danny Trejo DLC skin. Take a look at the new beefcakes and beefy mutants below.\r\n\n \nRead more",

And there are so many things I love about Portal 2 that it's quite hard to pick just one thing to write about.\nI could do \"the joy of Portal 2's retro science\", where you fall through the floor into the old school Aperture Science labs and see the 60s-ish version of all the big buttons and testing chambers you were put through in the first Portal. I could do \"the joy of the corrupted personality cores in Portal 2\", a group of corrupted AI spheres including Rick The Adventure Sphere, which is largely just Nolan North making up his own action theme song. I could even do \"the joy of potatoes in Portal 2\". And then I realised that most of the things I like about Portal 2 also intersect with Stephen Merchant's character Wheatley, a weird little guy (in the most pejorative sense).\nRead more",

All the cinematics we get of this infamous, terrifying murder-bot show him single-mindedly pursuing his targets, scuttling along walls, and wiping out enemies at close range like a cybernetic John Wick. But once you get in-game, his toolkit has always been fairly underwhelming - with the exception of his Death Totem, which never seemed to sit well thematically with the character.\nSeason 18 of Apex looks to change all that. Revenant is finally getting the love he deserves with a new sinister-looking base skin and a full rework of all his abilities. And guys, I think they might have gone a bit too far making him scary again. I think he might be overpowered.\nRead more",

The waterfront bank where the city’s great, good and gangster store their gold stands with its back to the sea, while a long and well-guarded bridge extends from its maw, like a money-hungry tongue. Legend says its top two floors are entirely without windows, the House an eyeless god to the citizens who reside on the hillside that slopes down toward the docks. So how was Gale, the wizard prodigy, able to bound from a faraway balcony to the brim of the bank, as if stepping lazily out onto his porch with a mug of coffee? Some say strange sorcery was afoot, but I’ve seen his character sheet, and so can be more specific.\nUpon levelling up, Gale multiclassed as a sorcerer - an odd choice, but one that allowed him to unlock the ability to throw magic from a great range. Suddenly, while casting a teleport spell, this hybrid mage was able to reach across the wide moat of the Counting House and land safely on a high ledge. It’s one of many obscure class synergies via which, Larian imagines, you’ll be able to break their level design in unexpected and entertaining ways.\nRead more",

          "description": "Portal 2 is obviously brilliant, in part because each of its chapters possesses a distinct charm. GLaDOS’ return, for instance, is a stretch of pure puzzling with just a dash of dread, while your first steps into the abandoned 1960s Aperture facility interrupt a fairly hopeless tone with an upbeat sense of discovery. For me, though, Portal 2 peaks late. So late that by the time it begins, your journey through the 'true' puzzle chambers are essentially over, leaving you as little more than a loose end in the big glowing eye of a former buddy. It’s Chapter 9: The Part Where He Kills You! Mmm, love that part.\nRead more",

My biggest triumph was recommending it to my dad, a 62-year-old retired manufacturing manager from Wales, who loved it so much he not only recommended it to a friend (who also loved it) but also said my mum should try it too - and I agree! It’s all subjective of course, but for me, its banger of a story, accessible it is, and how you can practically run it on a potato make it a wonderful gateway into gaming in general. \nRead more",

          "description": "Return Of The Obra Dinn is, quite rightly, one of the greatest video games of all time. It's certainly one of my personal favourites, and as this year's RPS 100 has proven, it's also greatly beloved by the rest of the RPS Treehouse. A brilliantly conceived murder mystery puzzle box (boat?) that not only has you working out whodunnit, but howdunnit, Obra Dinn is one of those detective games that really thrusts you into the thick of its deduction process. As you set about working out the identities and causes of death for each of the 60 souls onboard, it places you firmly in front of the ship's wheel before giving you free rein to steer its hull of supernatural horrors into whatever port of judgment you deem fit. \nThere are no truly wrong answers in Obra Dinn, but due to the nature of how you go about solving it, it's also one of those games I can't play too often without feeling like I know all the answers already. It's only now, five years later, that I feel like I could probably go back to Lucas Pope's nautical masterpiece and marvel at it afresh on a second playthrough, but there's one particular set of crew unmaskings that even its time-travelling stopwatch can't erase from my memory banks. Spoilers to follow obviously, but if you know, you know. I'm talking about the shoe and hammock revelation. \nRead more",

This headcrab and zombie-infested cess pit is an absolute horror show right from the off. Moans and screeches assault your ears from every nook and cranny of this dark murder hole, and if the hoarse crow calls and suspiciously high number of propane barrels weren't enough to put you off, the bloodied torsos lodged against its log cabin walls by deep set saw blades certainly will. Every fibre of your being is telling you to get the hell out of this place, and that surely, the Combine forces chasing you down here can't be worse than what's in front of you. \nBut I'd also add an addendum to that heading that goes something like this: \"We don't go to Ravenholm, and definitely not with just a gravity gun.\" This is a place that demands you to have as much firepower as you can possibly muster, such are the monstrosities that lie in wait here. But what did baby Katharine decide to do when she was playing it alone on her terrible university laptop in the dead of night back in 2010? She decided to have a go at that old Zombie Chopper achievement for no good reason whatsoever. And what followed was even more horrifying than Ravenholm had any right to be. \nRead more",

The grimdark horrors of Age Of Darkness: Final Stand might be a bit too hard as nails for my personal liking, but there's something about the act of building up my little settlements and defending them against ever-larger nightly hordes that just unlocks something in my brain that says, 'Yes, more of this, please'. It's the same feeling I got from the blocky delights of Diplomacy Is Not An Option and the deckbuilding, comic-book stylings of ORX, too, but now there's a new kid that's ridden into town who I think might be the king of the lot. \nThronefall is a more minimalist take on the citybuilder tower defender, but while its bright colours might look like the distant cousin of a Townscaper toybox (it is, after all, made by the same dev wot did the equally charming Islanders), this deadly little thing is absolutely genius. It's only just come out in early access today, but I've been having a great time with a pre-release build of it, and can feel it sinking its claws into me with every attempt at its final level. \nRead more",

Tato zranitelnost, označená jako CVE-2022–40982, umožňuje uživateli získat přístup k datům jiných uživatelů, kteří sdílejí stejný počítač, a ukrást je. Například škodlivá aplikace získaná z obchodu s aplikacemi může útok Downfall využít ke krádeži citlivých informací, jako jsou hesla, šifrovací klíče a soukromá data, například bankovní údaje, osobní e-maily a zprávy. Podobně ve virtualizovaném prostředí by mohl škodlivý zákazník zneužít zranitelnost Downfall ke krádeži dat a pověření od jiných zákazníků, kteří sdílejí stejný počítač.",

Yet I can’t help but feel the acclaimed developer must have felt a certain weight in developing this title.\nI mean, we’re not just talking any character. This is the Mickey Mouse, arguably the most famous animated character ever created. Outside of publishing Hudson’s Mickey Mousecapade, this would be Capcom’s first time giving Mickey a starring role.

Naturally, it was assumed that it would be the next installment in the popular South Park RPG series. However, it appears that won't be the case.\nDuring the 2023 THQ Nordic Digital Showcase, South Park: Snow Day was officially revealed. Players will battle through the snow-piled streets of South Park with up to three friends. Apparently, the highlight feature is that South Park will be in 3D, though I'm not sure that's a good thing.\nWe also got a reveal trailer:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEv35KH-DXQ\nI think I'd rather have another 2D RPG\nEven though South Park: The Stick of Truth and South Park: Fractured but Whole weren't for everyone, I could definitely appreciate what they were going for. A comical adventure in the world of South Park intended for fans of the show. Also, there's something to the 2D charm and honestly, it looks kinda goofy in 3D.\nIn fact, the trailer reminded me a lot of the South Park game on N64. Obviously with more modern visuals, but the same sort of goofy 3D graphics and gameplay.\nNo details on the actual game were provided other than it will be 3D and feature co-op multiplayer. It kind of looks similar to Fat Princess to me, but it's hard to really tell until we know more.\nSouth Park: Snow Day will release in 2024 on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and Nintendo Switch.\nThe post South Park: Snow Day is a new co-op multiplayer game that looks very mediocre appeared first on Destructoid.",

Beyond just being successful at innovating and even defining various genres, they had a strong interplay between their games that put even modern Nintendo to shame. Their development teams weren’t just skillful and talented, but they seemed to have real pride in their company. It felt like they were fans. And through that passion, it was hard not to become a fan yourself.\nIt makes the trajectory of modern Konami feel like that much more of a betrayal. They’re sitting on the games they made us fans of. Or worse.

TMNT: The Last Ronin follows a lone surviving turtle in a dark alternate future battle-ravaged New York City.\nTHQ Nordic also dropped a very simple reveal trailer, though it doesn't really tell us much.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx2ixJFWXcg\nI have to be honest, I completely forgot this was a possibility, even though Nickelodeon subtly revealed it earlier this year.

I have nothing against Spongebob, but this is definitely way better.\nUnfortunately, we didn't get any sort of details other than it will be based on the best-selling comic book. Also, it's worth noting that this is an official adaptation of TMNT: The Last Ronin, so it will probably follow the story of the comic.\nTMNT: The Last Ronin will be coming to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.

The charges state Glukhovsky posted texts and videos on his social channels claiming that Russian servicemen have been committing crimes in Ukraine.\nAs reported by the Associated Press, Glukhovskey was tried in absentia as he is not in Russia. A famed journalist and author, Glukhovsky was pronounced a \"foreign agent\" last year due to his critique of the Kremlin and Putin himself. This case falls under the law passed by Russian parliament shortly after the invasion of Ukraine, imposing jail terms of up to 15 years for spreading \"fake\" news about the military.\nDmitry Glukhovsky has been a vocal critic of the Russian regime for some time, and he hasn't been hiding it at all. The author has talked openly and critically on social channels about the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which started in February 2022.\nWithin games, Glukhovsky is well-known as the author behind the Metro series that spawned the video game adaptation. These dystopian novels follow survivors living in the metro of Russia, as rival factions vie for power beneath a post-nuclear wasteland.\nEven within the gaming world, Glukhovsky is hardly alone in his critique of Russia's behavior. Metro 2033 developer 4A Games called for support among many others, helping shine as bright of a limelight on the situation as possible for the industry.\nSome of the developers have, of course, had first-had experience with the war. Some of the devs have fought and even reportedly died on the frontline.\nThe post Metro 2033 author sentenced to 8 years in prison for discrediting Russian army appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Earlier this year GeForce Now accidentally leaked a few unannounced titles, including Titan Quest 2. Unfortunately, such leaks aren't always accurate, so I didn't get too excited.\nHowever, as part of the 2023 THQ Nordic Digital Showcase, we got a first look at Titan Quest 2. The action RPG will be coming to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. Even though we didn't see any gameplay, the announcement trailer did show off Ancient Greece as we've come to appreciate it in Titan Quest.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY6yb8OoFvw\nI can't wait to explore Ancient Greece again\nTitan Quest was a very popular ARPG that came out back in 2006 on PC. Eventually, it was remastered and re-released on PC as well as consoles, and it received several DLC expansions that brought the title back to life. Praised for its build diversity, itemization, and replayability, Titan Quest also served as the framework for the popular ARPG Grim Dawn.\nAccording to THQ Nordic, the sequel will return to the classic mythology-inspired setting of Titan Quest. The upcoming action RPG is being developed by the creators of SpellForce 3. Furthermore, Titan Quest 2 will feature some of the staples from the original, including a flexible character system, meaningful loot, and challenging combat. Also, TQ2 will include online multiplayer just like the original Titan Quest.\nWithout getting a look at the gameplay, this is about as excited as I can get. I put hundreds, maybe even thousands of hours into Titan Quest as a teenager. It was clearly a passion project from Diablo 2 fans. Despite how great D2 was, I personally enjoyed Titan Quest overall more.\nTHQ Nordic didn't provide any release timeframe yet, but hopefully we'll get some more details about Titan Quest 2 soon.\nThe post Titan Quest 2 is real and I’m very excited appeared first on Destructoid.",

THQ Nordic has promised a showcase with world premiere announcements as well as further feature news and reveals for already announced titles.\nSpecifically, Alone in the Dark, Gothic, Outcast: A New Beginning, Wreckreation, and Trine 5 will be in the show.\nThose interested in watching the digital showcase with us can do so on the THQ Nordic YouTube or Twitch channel.\nYou can also watch along below:\nhttps://youtu.be/6rRCEMRPo-E\nWhat can we expect from the Digital Showcase?\nOnce again, we have been told there are in fact some world premieres coming to this showcase. Furthermore, some of the titles they confirmed to be speaking about are releasing in the next few months, so I'm sure they will be highlighting those in particular. Trine releases at the end of this month on August 31. Also,  Alone in the Dark releases on October 25, so I'm sure we'll see some more gameplay from it.\nTheir showcase last year ended with a hint at a new South Park game which we have yet to get more details on. Who knows, maybe we'll get more info on that.\nPersonally, I'm hoping to see anything Darksiders. I am excited about the Gothic remake so definitely down to see more of that, and maybe even a release date. For now, all we know is that THQ Nordic considered 2024 as the realistic release window for it.\nThe post Let’s watch the 2023 THQ Nordic Digital Showcase today appeared first on Destructoid.",

More specifically, users have a combined playtime of over 10,000,000 hours; which equates to over 1,225 years. With a current all-time peak of 814,466 concurrent players on Steam, it was obvious that BG3 was getting serious playtime. But, even still, these numbers are massive.\nLarian also revealed some pretty interesting stats from the opening weekend. Half-Elf is the most picked race and much to my surprise, Paladin is the most chosen class. Not that there's anything wrong with Paladin, I just expected it to be something more obvious: like Barbarian or Rogue, or even Wizard. Githyanki and Halfing aren't the go-to choices for that many people, nor is the Cleric class.\n[caption…",

For $29.82 (normally $134.94) you're getting a massive chunk of Mega Man, spanning multiple Legacy Collections, Mega Man 11, and the Zero/ZX Legacy Collection. If you were to pick up the recent-ish Battle Network re-releases, you'd have a pretty good collection of many mainline Mega-games. You can cross-check that for yourself in the image below, taken from my Mega Man collection (which I started in 1990!).\n[caption id=\"attachment_396110\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Photo by Destructoid[/caption]\nHere are all the games you get with the Mega Man Summer Pack (with reviews!)\nWhile the bundle technically states that you get \"six items,\" it's actually six compilations you're picking up with the Summer Pack. It covers the vast majority of mainline Mega Man history, from the original 1987 classic to 2018's Mega Man 11. Note that like other Steam sales, if you already have access to any included games, the platform will deduct the ones you own from the total price.\nAnd because we're Destructoid, we reviewed them all! Feel free to peruse the links below if you're looking to just pick up a few compilations, but the entire shebang is worth it if you can spare the coin.\nMega Man Legacy Collection\nMega Man Legacy Collection 2\nMega Man X Legacy Collection \nMega Man X Legacy Collection 2\nMega Man 11\nMega Man Zero/ZX Legacy Collection\nThere's a larger Capcom End of Summer Sale going on if you're interested\nMega Man is arguably the best part of Capcom's \"End of Summer Sale,\" but there's a bigger promotion going on at this landing page here (the summer is ending?

This is evidenced by the fact that viewership seems to be on the up and up, with millions still tuning in each month.\nCold hard data seems to back this up, as a report from Gamesindustry.biz states that Twitch has recorded 1.8 billion hours for July 2023. This represents a 5% increase over June, with daily viewership having gone up since March of this year. The figures come from StreamElements and Rainmaker.gg.\n[caption id=\"attachment_396076\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\"] Image via Backstage.[/caption]\nOn top of that, GTA 5 is still the number one game to watch, with 139 million hours logged. Other top titles for the Amazon-owned platform include League of Legends, Minecraft, CS:GO, and Dota 2. Basically, a lot of PvP and/or otherwise multiplayer games.\nRecent Twitch backlashes\nHowever, it's not all peachy for Twitch. The site came under fire from streamers recently when its new Partner Plus program was announced. Many felt that qualifying for the better revenue split was unobtainable for a lot of people who rely on the service for income.\nMaintaining a recurring subscription count of 350 for three months already sounds like a lofty ask. Add to that the fact that Amazon Prime subs and gifted subs don't count, and it's easy to see why a lot of streamers find this target difficult.\nThat said, from a viewer's perspective, things seem to be going pretty well. With close to two billion hours in total watched for July alone, gamers are evidently finding plenty to watch on Twitch. It's just a shame the company continues to disappoint many of its broadcasters.\nThe post Twitch viewership up 5%, 1.8 billion hours watched appeared first on Destructoid.",

While the contents of id Software's classic game are enough to keep us satiated (especially those of us who love the original 1997 release), there's something else to look forward to.\nIn a recent post on Twitter, Laced Records, a company that specializes in vinyl soundtracks for video games, is unleashing Quake 2's music. The tweet links to the website, which shows there are two versions, one of which will be a limited edition.\nhttps://twitter.com/Laced_audio/status/1689683030313500672\nWhile both of them will set you back $38 each, the limited edition press will feature \"two solid red and orange A-side/B-side effect LPs,\" which looks pretty fancy judging by the images.\nWhen can I get it?!\nHold your horses. This Quake 2 vinyl is not out just yet. The website says both versions will be released in January 2024, but you can pre-order yours now.\nThe soundtrack to the game is quite memorable, heading much more into rock/metal territory than the NIN ambient sounds of the first Quake game. Q2's music was conducted by Sonic Mayhem (who also did soundtracks to games like The Division and Deux Ex: Mankind Divided) and Jer Sypult. Horror director and musician Rob Zombie also contributed to the game's main theme.\nIt may be more than two and a half decades old, but Quake 2 is an important part of 90s gaming, especially in the FPS genre. Okay, it may not have had the same impact as the first Quake or the OG Doom entries, but it's still a classic, and now we have a remaster (and soon the vinyl) we can enjoy.\nThe post Quake 2 limited edition vinyl can be yours to own soon appeared first on Destructoid.",

That’s not surprising, considering it was only released in Japanese arcades in 2005. It’s a twee sidescroller that is sometimes considered a spiritual successor to Parasol Stars: The Story of Bubble Bobble III (also with an upcoming port). You play as Nico, who beats the crap out of robots with a magical umbrella. It’s an interesting platformer in the classic arcade style that came out when that particular niche had gone all but extinct.\nhttps://youtu.be/HP7rF_d8j64\nThis is really good news for another reason. It might mean Taito is eyeing some other Taito X board games that were never released outside of the arcade. Chase H.Q. 2, maybe? Or, heck, we could use a Chase H.Q. collection. It’s exciting to have Taito mining through its back catalog of arcade games with things like the Taito Milestones collections.\nThe arcade platform benefits heavily from preservation efforts. Even if there were home ports of a given game, they were often inaccurate. Because the hardware was often extremely different from game to game, emulation can be difficult, so some companies just don’t even bother. It’s nice when someone makes the effort.\nSpica Adventure will be coming to Switch, PS4, PS5, and Xbox in Spring 2024.

However, FromSoftware has always managed to keep the file sizes of its titles in check.\nFor comparison, the massive open-world Elden Ring was under 50GB on consoles and only 60GB on PC. Dark Souls 3 was only 25GB on all platforms.\nWhen we look at the file sizes of Elden Ring, Xbox as a platform was right in the middle. Therefore, it's possible the size of Armored Core 6 will be smaller on PlayStation and bigger on PC.\n[caption id=\"attachment_395925\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Bandai Namco[/caption]\nWhat about Armored Core 6 preload on PlayStation and PC?\nUnfortunately, there's been no word on a pre-load date for Steam users on PC. Even though we don't have a date, typically Steam grants a couple of days of pre-load before a AAA release.\nPlayStation players on the other hand will be able to pre-load Armored Core 6 starting on August 23, which is two days before it releases.\nArmored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon releases on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S on August 25.\nThe post You can preload Armored Core 6 now on Xbox appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "What are you reading this for? Nightdive’s rumored remaster of Quake II has been released, and you might already own it if you already had a version of Quake II on Steam or something. If the PC version is too good for you, then it’s also available on Xbox, Switch, and PlayStation platforms. What am I even writing this for?\nOkay, because I’m expected to meet a certain word threshold to please the internet robots, I’ll tell you more. Bethesda and Nightdive dropped a remaster for the original 1996 Quake back in 2021, and it was an excellent source port of the classic game. It kind of felt like a similar Quake 2 remaster in the KEX Engine was an inevitability, but we only heard murmurings about it until today.\nQuake 2 was initially released at the tail end of 1997, and featured a new, jazzed-up engine to take advantage of hardware acceleration. It wasn’t initially planned as a sequel to Quake, but gradually began shifting in that direction. Most notably, it has no narrative connection to the first game’s very loose story. Instead, it introduces a space war against the cyborg-like Strogg.\nQuake is often considered to be the last game by id Software’s classic line-up. After some creative differences, a bunch of staff departed id, including John Romero. You can absolutely feel it in Quake 2, as it’s unusually cohesive for the studio. There was sort of a wild experimentation in early id games that kind of lags behind the technical wizardry in Quake II.\nOkay, good enough? The Quake II remaster is now available on PC, Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch. It includes all its expansions, as well as a port of the N64 version’s campaign. Cool, bye!\nThe post Quake II’s Nightdive remaster is live right now appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Spread open your wallets, the Pokémon Center Store has unveiled a new 10 ¼ inch plush. This one depicts everyone’s favorite protrusion, Wiglett.\nNumbered 960 on the National Pokédex, Wiglett was introduced in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet. While they resembled the shorter and more girthy Diglett, Wiglett is considered a different species rather than a regional variant. You can tell Wiglett apart by its much longer, slender length capped off by a red, nose-like tip.\nThe plush stands firmly at 10 ¼ inch length and 4 ¾ inches wide, which is quite a bit below average for your standard Wiglett. It’s held up by a large, sack-like base. Its long, pale shaft will no doubt delight company when you display it for all to see. The store page notes that its body is bendable, so it should stay rigid and erect as you pose it into different configurations. Meanwhile, its soft body invites you to take it into bed with you so you can spend all night together.\nAll in all, Wiglett is a perfect addition to anyone’s collection of Pocket Monsters. Judging by social media’s response, it is already being embraced by fans everywhere. It’s the perfect way to add some excitement to your evening.\nThe plush Wiglett is available now at the Pokémon Center shop for $24.99.

          "description": "In the lead-up to the release of the PlayStation VR2, Sony ran a marketing campaign to hype up fans. One of the ads featured musician Ozzy Osbourne, who also promoted the VR2 headset on Twitter. One of his tweets, posted on February 20, stated: “Did this spot with @Playstation team. We had a lot of fun. Their new VR2 is really amazing.” The tweet also included a PS VR2 video ad featuring Osbourne.\nThe seemingly innocuous message caught the attention of the UK's Advertising Standards Authority. The main complaint is that the tweet did not adequately identify itself as marketing material. On August 9, The ASA concluded that the “ad must not appear again in the form complained about.” Furthermore, Sony and Osbourne were also warned to “ensure that in future their ads were obviously identifiab…",

          "description": "Ravenage Games has announced that Königsborgs’ card-based restaurant-slash-mafia sim Don Duality will be released on August 25th.\nDon Duality has you in the shoes of a newly empowered mob boss.  You have to juggle both the demands of organized crime and your money-laundering restaurant front. It uses a card-driven system that takes you through the difficult crime-slash-dining events as you build up both empires. You’re tasked with equipping your crew and keeping your customers happy while restoring your family to their rightful place in the criminal underground.\nI’ve said this before, but Don Duality reminds me of the Pizza Connection games. They both connect organized crime with restaurant management, which is a pretty tantalizing mix. In Pizza Connection, you would send goons to sabotage and steal from your other competitors, which I don’t think is what this game is going for. We can hope, though.\nOr you could just check out the prologue demo, Don Duality: Initiation. I meant to do that, but I only really play demos for work, and I never got around to it. I’ve enjoyed a good few deckbuilding games recently, love management games, and also do a lot of crime, so this looks up my alley. Maybe it’s up your alley too. You can talk to me.

          "description": "Let's face it: If it weren't for the modding community, games like Fallout 4 probably wouldn't still be a major part of the AAA gaming world. Despite the Bethesda RPG coming out in 2015, it's still getting plenty of love, as evidenced by this one modification that fixes load times.\nThanks to Nexus Mods user Antonix35, you can now enjoy speedier loading times with their Fallout 4 plugin. As well as making the game load faster in general, the mod also fixes \"in-game vertical sync for high frame rate monitors,\" adds in the ability to \"select loading screens,\" and more.\nhttps://youtu.be/bfEcyRJ4Bo0\nThe modder says the whole thing works by \"speeding up slow locations in game code that are slowing down other loading threads.\" Now, I don't know much about the inner workings of modding so that means nothing to me. However, some of you out there will have a better understanding of what Antonix35's Long Loading Times Fix does. I mean, it works!\nThe proof of the pudding is in the loading\nJust to make sure that we get an idea of just how fast Fallout 4's load times are now, a video has been provided that shows the mod in action.\nA timer in the corner displays how much quicker it is now to fast travel between locations and other loading zones. Some of the times are now just a couple of seconds. The quickest one seen in the clip is when the player enters an internal location at Diamon City, which clocks in at 0.64 seconds.\nIn fact, the longest time we get to see is when the game itself is loaded up at the start. It takes just over eight seconds to boot up the save file, which is still pretty impressive.\nThe post Fallout 4 loading times have never been better, thanks to this mod appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The highly anticipated Tekken 8 recently caused a stir among fans when they noticed that the End User License Agreement on Steam made mention of the controversial anti-tamper software Denuvo. Fortunately, game director Katsuhiro Harada took to Twitter to announce he has “no plans to introduce Denuvo or anything else.”\nhttps://twitter.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1688677772116504576\nAccording to Harada, the mention of Denuvo is likely because the EULA is a copy of Tekken 7’s. Although Harada’s Tweet isn’t a definitive confirmation that Tekken 8 won't use the anti-tamper software, it is a good sign.\n[caption id=\"attachment_394394\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot by Destructoid[/caption]\nTekken 8 could avoid some of Tekken 7’s problems\nDevelopers use Denuvo to prevent (or at least stall) games from being cracked and pirated. Ideally, it shouldn't affect gameplay. Nevertheless, both players and developers have previously complained about the anti-tamper software, with some developers eventually removing it from their games. Denuvo has acknowledged the negative press, though the issues surrounding it continue.\nTekken 7 was well recieved when it released in 2015. However, it did suffer from frame rate drops and other performance issues on PC. Harada attributed this to the game’s anti-tamper software, which happened to be Denuvo. This naturally explains why fans felt upset about the mention of Denuvo in Tekken 8's EULA, and why Harada is so adamant on avoiding it.\nhttps://twitter.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/984835707209375744\nThough Harada has suggested players “sit quietly”, impatient fans have been exploiting the Closed Network Test to play beyond the test period.

          "description": "Earlier this year, Paramount teased that a video game based on the popular Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles graphic novel, The Last Ronin, was in development. While we haven't heard much since then, today's THQ Nordic Digital Showcase gave us a teaser trailer. Unfortunately, we did not get any looks at gameplay or additional information.\nIn the Last Ronin graphic novel storyline, the final surviving member of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is on a quest for revenge in a ruined New York City. Both the trailer and the new synopsis point toward this being the case for the game as well. \"Who is the Last Ronin? In a future, battle-ravaged New York City, a lone surviving Turtle embarks on a seemingly hopeless mission seeking justice for the family he lost. From the minds of the creators of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and based on the best-selling comic book event by Eastman, Waltz, Bishop, Delgado, and the Escorza Brothers: the official video game adaptation of TMNT: The Last Ronin.\"\n\n\nAccording to senior vice president for games and emerging media at Paramount Global in his interview with Polygon back in March, TMNT: The Last Ronin will be a single-player action RPG similar to the modern God of War series. The title will feature a mature tone, which should be exciting for fans of the comic series, but Rosen made it clear back in March that the game was years away from release.\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Last Ronin doesn't currently have a release window, but is currently slated to come to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel (or you can watch the videos in the above playlist or by clicking the links below). \nBanjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.\nJoin me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey. \nPart 1\nPart 2\nPart 3\nPart 4\nPart 5\nPart 6\nPart 7\nPart 8\nPart 9\nPart 10\nPart 11\nPart 12\nPart 13\nPart 14\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

          "description": "Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis, the mobile RPG retelling the FFVII saga, finally has a release date. The game was first announced in February 2021. \nEver Crisis hits iOS and Android on September 7. The game is a free-to-play single-player chapter-structured RPG that spans the entire FFVII timeline. Expect to relieve key elements of the original 1997 game plus new story elements written by FF VII Remake story and scenario writer Kazushige Nojima that center on a young Sephiroth. Gameplay includes active-time battles, and monetization takes the form of microtransactions for certain weapons and equipment. See it in action in the latest trailer from Summer Game Fest in June.\n\n\nThis will be the latest stab at bringing FFVII content to mobile. In January, Square Enix shut down Final Fantasy VII The First Soldier, its mobile battle royale that was revealed alongside Ever Crisis two years ago. Hopefully, Ever Crisis has a better run and offers a solid appetizer until Final Fantasy VII Rebirth launches next year.",

In Destiny 2, Reddick played Commander Zavala – an important recurring character in Destiny lore. Reddick was also an outspoken fan of the game that engaged with the community often, so recasting his role was always going to be a difficult task.\nToday, Bungie announced that legendary actor Keith David would be taking over the role. David is an accomplished film and television actor appearing in movies like The Thing and TV shows like Community (pictured below).\nHe has also voiced a number of characters in animated films and video games. He played Dr. Facilier in The Princess and the Frog and he played Keith David in Saint's Row IV. Perhaps his most famous video game role, however, is that of The Arbiter in Halo games. David is no stranger to working with Bungie.\nIn the post on Bungie's site announcing the casting, David said, \"I am honored to continue the great work of Lance Reddick as Zavala. Lance captured the character's sense of integrity so wonderfully. It is my intention to continue that work.\"",

After an absolute dearth of new content on the tail end of the original game's lifecycle, Overwatch 2 did little to regain favor with its community, thanks to polarizing changes to the game's structure and the cancellation of the highly anticipated Hero Missions.

          "description": "If you were looking forward to playing the pro-wrestling-themed RPG WrestleQuest today for its launch, it looks like that card was subject to change. The game has suffered a last-minute delay and will now arrive on August 22.\nDeveloper Mega Cat Studios and publisher Skybound Games announced the delay yesterday evening, explaining the cause was due to the discovery of a save glitch. The statement reads,\n“When performing final checks on one of our launch platforms, we discovered it was possible for players to lose their save game progress when playing WrestleQuest on multiple different devices. Because this is a game filled with hours of content and player progress is so important, we could never bodyslam our fans like that.”\nWhile it’s a bummer to see the game get pushed back mere hours before launch, it’s a good thing the team caught this issue before it could affect players. Curious wrestling and RPG fans will have to wait another couple of weeks, but at least they'll presumably be able to play with some peace of mind. \nWrestleQuest unfolds in a world molded after action figure wrestling leagues with protagonist Randy “Muchacho Man” Santos on a quest to become the ultimate superstar. Inspired by classics like Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy VI, you’ll partner with a large cast of fellow grapplers to unleash special attacks and tag team moves on your opponents. In addition to fictional personalities, several real-life stars appear in the game, including Jeff Jarrett, Jake “The Snake” Roberts, Sgt. Slaughter, among others.\nWresleQuest will be available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, PC, and on mobile via Netflix.",

Best of all, you can add one of the most coveted Pokémon from Gen I, Mew, to your party for free right now. Then, you can gear up to challenge the powerful Mewtwo during the aptly named Get Mew And Mewtwo event.\nBeginning now, you can receive Mew as a Mystery Gift in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. To do this, simply go to the Mystery Gift in-game menu while connected to the internet and enter the password \"GETYOURMEW\" before September 18. Each Mew's Tera Type, nature, and moves will be different to reflect the Mythical Pokémon's flexible capabilities. You'll be able to add Mew to your party and continue your adventures around the Paldea region, but you can also participate in the second portion of this event.\nThe second phase of this event kicks off September 1, with Mewtwo appearing in special Tera Raid battles. If you're able to defeat Mewtwo in these Tera Raid battles, you'll be rewarded with the opportunity to catch a Mewtwo with the Mightiest Mark, meaning these will be seven-star Tera Raid battles. The Pokémon Company also teases that if you challenge Mewtwo with Mew, you can expect \"something special.\"\nPokémon Scarlet and Violet will also play host to several other Tera Raid battle events during this time. Wave 1 runs from today until August 17, Wave 2 runs from August 18 until August 31, and then Mewtwo finally arrives from September 1 to September 17.\n\n\nDuring the same Pokémon Presents livestream, we also learned a lot about the upcoming Pokémon Scarlet and Violet expansions. For more on Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, be sure to check out our review. If you're more about the nostalgic side of the Pokémon franchise, this Pokémon Presents had you covered there as well, as Nintendo Switch Online also added two '90s Pokémon spin-offs to its classic game catalog.",

Activision confirmed today’s reveal last week after the game leaked online.\nThe teaser doesn’t provide much to go on except the release date; platforms are unannounced, but we imagine it'll be on the usual suspects. Sledgehammer Games is taking the reins, making it the first Modern Warfare title not made by Infinity Ward (but it's still assisting, as all Call of Duty studios tend to). Sledgehammer's last entry was 2021’s Call of Duty: Vanguard, and it also developed WWII and Advanced Warfare. \n\n\nIn the meantime, be sure to check out our Modern Warfare II review and read how that game and Warzone will continue to get content updates in the form of new celebrity operators such as Snoop Dogg and Nicki Minaj. You can also read about how Sony signed a deal with Microsoft to keep the franchise on PlayStation for the next decade as part of the ongoing Microsoft/Activision acquisition.",

          "description": "Almost exactly one year ago, SNK announced a new Fatal Fury game, the first in over 20 years, was in the works. During EVO this weekend, the company revealed the game’s title is Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves, alongside a new teaser trailer.\nThe video shows off some brief in-game footage of staples Terry Bogard and Rock Howard in action. Unfortunately, we don’t see much more than that, and SNK has only promised to share more information at a later date. \n\n\nThe last Fatal Fury game was 1999’s Garou: Mark of the Wolves, so a new entry has been a long time coming for fans. Hopefully, it arrives sooner than later and is another big fighting game to anticipate during a relative boom period for the genre thanks to Street Fighter 6 and the upcoming Mortal Kombat 1 and Tekken 8.

          "description": "Indie publisher Devolver Digital has announced a slew of delays for some of its more anticipated titles on the horizon. Framed through a humorous parody of a Nintendo Direct, Devolver released a \"Devolver Delayed Showcase\" to tell players all about the games they won't be playing in 2023. The showcase highlights five games in particular: The Plucky Squire, Skate Story, Anger Foot, Stick it to the Stickman, and Pepper Grinder.\n\"We have some exciting news about next year,\" one host says. \"This year's delays,\" the other host follows up. \"Some of our brightest upcoming titles are finding their way to 2024!\"\nThe Plucky Squire, a game that bounces between 2D and 3D gameplay, is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. Pixel-art platformer Pepper Grinder is currently slated to arrive on Switch and PC. Meanwhile, roguelite brawler Stick it to the Stickman, kickflipping sports-action game Skate Story, and foot-based first-person shooter Anger Foot are currently only listed for PC. \nYou can see the full Devolver Delayed Showcase below.\n\n\nDevolver Digital has had a solid 2023, with titles like Terra Nil receiving positive reviews, fan-favorite Bleak Sword DX making its way to Switch and PC, and new content for Cult of the Lamb, but today's delays are sure to disappoint some. However, by this point in time, many players recognize that it's better to delay a game than to launch it before it's ready, and with Gunbrella and The Talos Principle 2 still slated for 2023, the indie publisher still has seemingly a lot in store for fans before the calendar changes over to 2024.",

After 13 years, that finally changes with a surprise jump to PlayStation 4 and Switch.\nRockstar announced today that Double Eleven Studios is creating these ports, which include the zombie-themed Undead Nightmare expansion in one package. This also means that PlayStation 5 players can experience the game due to PS4 backwards compatibility. While it's unclear if these versions feature any kind of performance or graphical improvements, they do have additional language support for simplified and traditional Chinese, Korean, Polish, Brazilian Portuguese, Russian, and Latin American Spanish. \n\n\nRed Dead Redemption follows former outlaw John Marston on a quest to track down the remaining members of his old crew, the Van der Linde Gang, in order to save his family. Its prequel, Red Dead Redemption II, arrived in 2018. If you missed out on the original the first time around, you can pick up Red Dead Redemption digitally on PS4 and Switch on August 17 for $49.99. Physical copies hit stores on October 13. To learn more about the game, be sure to read our original reviews for the base game and Undead Nightmare.",

          "description": "Following her announcement as the first all-new character to join the Street Fighter 6 roster by way of DLC, A.K.I. gave fans a taste of what to expect when she is added to the game this fall. During this weekend's Evo 2023 fighting game tournament, we received a host of new announcements, including new characters added to the roster of the upcoming Mortal Kombat 1 and even a surprise TMNT collaboration with Street Fighter 6. However, Capcom didn't stop there, as it gave us the first teaser trailer for its 20th playable character, A.K.I.\nDescribed as \"a manaical poison aficionado,\" A.K.I. certainly seems to fit right in with the long lineage of over-the-top and deranged characters within the Street Fighter universe. You can check out the surprisingly dark teaser trailer for A.K.I. below.\n\n\nWhile we already knew A.K.I. was planned, the teaser comes hot on the heels of the release of Rashid, the first DLC character for Street Fighter 6. Rashid debuted in Street Fighter V, but joined the roster of Street Fighter 6 less than two weeks prior to this teaser. A.K.I. arrives in Street Fighter 6 this fall. Both characters – as well as the two remaining members of Year 1, Ed and Akuma – are included in the Deluxe Edition, Ultimate Edition, or Year 1 Character Pass. Rashid is also currently available for individual purchase for 350 Fighter Coins (approximately $7). Regardless of how you obtain Rashid, you also get his secondary outfit and two additional color options. It stands to reason that A.K.I. will follow a similar release method. \nFor more on Street Fighter 6, check out our glowing review of the game, as well as our cover story. If you're new to the Street Fighter franchise, you can get caught up with our history of the series' first 30 years right here.",

          "description": "Mortal Kombat 1’s roster continues to expand, and the latest trailer reveals a returning staple and two long-lost fighters from the series’ 2000s era: Reptile, Ashrah, and Havik.\nThe lengthy trailer provides a great look at the new looks and abilities of each character as well as their respective roles in the story. Reptile is back in his more human form but can still shapeshift into his natural, intimidating lizard body to devour opponents.  \nFans of 2004’s Mortal Kombat: Deception should be happy to see the returns of Ashrah and Havik. Each made their debut in that game, and neither has appeared in the series since Deception’s follow-up, Mortal Kombat: Armageddon in 2006. Ashrah sports a much different look and moveset but remains a demoness mostly cleansed of her inherent evil. Havik appears to retain his chaotic brand of body-contorting, limb-tearing offense. Sareena has also been confirmed as a new Kameo fighter to fan the flame of 2000s nostalgia. Check out the new trailer and a fresh batch of screenshots below. \n\n\n       \n\nMortal Kombat 1 launches on September 19 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.

In this world – Ziêminal – there's no good and no evil; just monsters and enemies in your way. And if today's Deathbound trailer is anything to go on, they won't go down without a fight. \nCheck out the Deathbound reveal trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see in the trailer above, players can freely switch between various heroes of different classes in a party at any time, and they'll need to do so to survive in specific situations. Trialforge Studio calls this a \"Binding System, allowing players to absorb the essence of the fallen warriors found throughout the world.\" Using the collected essence, players can obtain new skills and abilities to transform their playstyle, or they can use it to form a party of heroes they can then switch between. \nBinding also unlocks Morphstrikes, which combines all of a party's power into a devastating blow. \n\n\"The memories and identities of the fallen will be uncovered through Binding as well,\" a press release reads. \"In addition to environment and items, essence will reveal the narrative behind the world of Ziêminal and its inhabitants. Though players must tread carefully when Binding, as not all heroes converge harmoniously. The conflicts caused by divergent essences absorbed will greatly impact the gameplay and narrative alike.\" \nDeathbound is due out sometime in 2024 on Steam.",

The game’s eerie atmosphere and lack of dialogue lend to the game’s enigmatic nature, and multiple endings offer various truths about the threat you face.\n\n\nSomerville launched for Xbox and PC last November to generally warm reviews, though was noted for its rough technical performance, which has since been improved in post-launch updates.

          "description": "Striking Distance Studios, the studio behind last year’s action horror title The Callisto Protocol, has suffered layoffs.\nIt’s been confirmed via IGN that 32 employees have been let go from the studio. These include production coordinator Sebastian Marlow, associate producer Nora Falcon, senior environment artist Matthew Smith, and VFX artist Matt Christopherson. \nA spokesperson for Krafton, Striking Distance’s parent company, gave the following statement to IGN: \n“Striking Distance Studios and Krafton have implemented strategic changes that realign the studio’s priorities to better position its current and future projects for success. Unfortunately, these changes have impacted 32 employees. Honoring the invaluable contributions of each departing team member with material support in the form of outplacement services and meaningful severance packages is our top priority during this difficult moment.”\nStriking Distance was founded in 2019 by Dead Space co-creator Glen Schofield alongside industry veterans. The Callisto Protocol was its first title, released in December 2022. Set in a prison on Jupiter’s moon of Callisto in 2320, it follows an inmate’s escape following an alien outbreak. The game received a mixed reception from critics and players; we scored it a 6 out of 10 in our review. It was reported in January that The Callisto Protocol underperformed in sales compared to its reportedly massive budget. \nThe Callisto Protocol’s story expansion, Final Transmission, was released on June 28.  \n[Source: IGN]",

However, if you’ve been paying attention to the Call of Duty space, it’s no surprise that this year’s Call of Duty is Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III.

This aligns with a recent Modern Warfare II Season 5 blog post, which announced that the next Call of Duty would be revealed in-game through a “special event.” \nIt seems that reveal is happening next week, although when or how remains unclear. Interestingly, the reveal of a new Call of Duty releasing this year contrasts with reports from early last year stating Call of Duty would skip 2023. \nIn the meantime, read how Lara Croft, Nicki Minaj, Snoop Dogg, and 21 Savage are coming to Modern Warfare II and Warzone, and then read Game Informer’s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II review.

Survivor launched on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC earlier this year, in April, and received critical acclaim – Game Informer gave it a 9.25, making it a must-play game. But it skipped the PS4 and Xbox One generation that its predecessor, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, launched on. \n\n\n“Thanks to the strength of this legendary franchise and community demand, our development team has committed to bringing this Jedi experience to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,” Wilson said during the call, according to The Verge. \nFallen Order launched on PS4 and Xbox One with some technical difficulties, and while Survivor wasn’t perfect on that front, it performed a lot better on the now current-gen hardware. It will be interesting to see how it performs on the previous-gen hardware that Fallen Order had difficulties with. As for when to expect this Survivor port, it sounds like it could be a while because IGN reports that Wilson said the port is “in the early stages of development.” \nWhile waiting for it to hit PS4 and Xbox One one day, read Game Informer’s Star Wars Jedi: Survivor review and then read about how the game’s director wants the series to be a trilogy. Watch our video interview with Cal Kestis actor Cameron Monaghan about the sequel after that. \n[Source: The Verge]\nAre you waiting to play Star Wars Jedi: Survivor on PS4 or Xbox One?

          "description": "Nintendo’s next console will reportedly be portable like the Switch and is targeting a release in the second half of 2024, according to a new report today from VideoGamesChronicle. \nVGC cites “multiple people with knowledge of Nintendo’s next-gen console plans” that reveal Nintendo’s Switch successor is aiming for a release in the second half of next year, to ensure there’s plenty of stock at launch. Nintendo wants to avoid the stock shortages that plagued the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S release for months (and years for some). \n\n\nThe publication reports that two of its sources suggest the next-generation console will use LCD screens, like those seen on the launch versions of the Switch, rather than the OLED screens used in the Switch OLED models. The use of LCD reduces costs, VGC writes, in light of the likely need for significantly more storage than what’s in the Switch, which will increase costs. \nVGC’s sources also suggest Nintendo’s next console will be playable on the go, similar to the Switch’s console-handheld hybrid nature. Its sources also say the console will continue using physical cartridges like the Switch, although it’s unclear if this console will be backwards compatible with the Switch.\nIn February of last year, Nintendo said the Switch was in the middle of its lifecycle, meaning that while a new Nintendo console might launch next year, the company might not necessarily abandon the Switch any time soon. However, if Nintendo continues support of the Switch alongside a next-gen console, it’s unclear how that will work as, presumably, this new console will be a good bit more powerful than the Switch. \nRegardless of how Nintendo approaches Switch support following the release of a new console and backwards compatibility, the Super Mario Bros. maker likely wants to convert the Switch’s massive install base into its following product. \n[Source: VideoGamesChronicle]\nWhat do you want from a next-gen Nintendo console?

In it, we get new looks at Liu Kang, including a new fatality for him, and Geras. \nYou can check out the MK1 Keepers of Time trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nOver the weekend, MK1 director Ed Boon tweeted an image with what many think might be a new character debuting in the game. Boon writes, “New phone. Who dis?” and circles the unknown character, leading many to believe it’s a tease of a new fighter.\nNew phone.

The orders are yet to appear in public, but we're informed that the Premier League will be able to block pirate IPTV services during the 2023/2024 and 2024/2025 seasons. Interestingly, the Sky order seems to cover a much shorter period but does identify six pirate IPTV services by name.\nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",

Thank you to those who submitted bug reports about this, and if you still locate a version that is not recognised, please report it to us (beware that the frankenstein versions that are floating around the internet will not be accepted, only those copied from the original media).\nFor the full and comprehensive list of notable changes, please refer to the Release Notes.\nIf you are as excited about the release as we are, you can share our joy by downloading it from our downloads page. If you are using Windows, macOS, or either of the Ubuntu Snap or Flatpack packages, the autoupdater will pick up the ScummVM 2.7.1 release automatically.

          "description": "Adibou, the first game in the beloved children's series, is now ready for public testing!\nAlso known as Adi Jr.'s World of Discoveries, this 1991 Coktel Vision title began the educational Adibou collection aimed at children of age 4 to 7 years.\nMany of the iconic activities and mechanisms of the series were already part of this first opus: planting flowers, playing the game Breakout, and being rewarded with sweets upon completing Read/Count exercises. And of course, this was Adibou's first appearance! Although the floppy release has him speak the same strange gibberish as heard in the Goblins series, he is still the patient and funny learning partner that he's remembered for being in later games.\nScummVM supports all of the game's releases, from the initial 16-color floppy ones to later 1994 CD versions with richer graphics and sound effects. So dig out your dusty Adibou disks, get a ScummVM daily development build, and start collecting sweets while completing math and reading exercises! Please also contact us if you own a version ScummVM is not yet aware of, and report to the issue tracker any problem you may encounter.\nAs much as ScummVM aims to replicate the original gaming experience, there is one feature we are unfortunately unable to support. When hardworking children complete their virtual sweets collection, a message invites them to mail a floppy disk with their savegame to Coktel Vision, who would send them a parcel containing Coktel goodies and actual sweets! So if you are introducing children to Adibou through ScummVM, be prepared to go to the nearest shop and buy some candy for when they finish the game!\n>",
