Splatoon 3 is 2022's best-selling game on the eShop, which shouldn't be a shock given that it broke records in both physical and digital sales when it first launched.\nRight behind Splatoon is January's Pokémon Legends: Arceus, with Pokémon Violet taking the third spot (Scarlet is in fourth as both games are counted separately). Monster Hunter Rise, last year's number one, rounds out the top five, likely thanks to Sunbreak's launch over the summer. These rankings are based on sales on the eShop between January 1, 2022 and December 20, 2022.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It's a charming love letter to puzzle game fans with an incredible amount of heart put into it. But despite that, once you start peeling back the layers, you’re left with a great core gameplay loop that is too lacking in content to feel like a finished project.\nIn The Punchuin, you take direct control of a penguin who is quite fond of punching and sets out to look for the treasure hidden in the depths of Punch Mountain. With the help of a giant sentient boxing glove, you tackle multiple challenges to collect diamonds from each level in order to pass the various gates blocking your path further down. The plot, while simple, serves its purpose quite well, and is helped tremendously by the wonderfully endearing and witty dialogue.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Over the past twelve months, the RPS treehouse and our merry band of freelancers have reviewed 168 games in total - and that includes early access reviews, PC-port reviews, group reviews, reviews-in-progresses, and your common or garden fully-fledged reviews. 168! Damn. Even though game releases are still suffering from pandemic pushbacks, 2022 has been a busy year for games. There wasn't a huge number of big name releases - although the ones that did come out were plenty big enough - but, as always, we've had a wealth of wonderful indies releasing all year round, and we scooped up as many of them as we could.\nOut of all the games we’ve given any kind of review treatment throughout the year, only a handful of them recieved RPS’s coveted Bestest Best badge; just 22, to be exact. I've gathered them all in one big round-up bundle below (there are round-ups of our favourite bits from other sections of the site, too), and they make a great collection of games.

It depends on how quickly you scroll past, I suppose. \r\n\n\r\nI joined team Arpus all the way back in February, and to say the last 11 months have been a whirlwind is a bit of an understatement. In less than a year I’ve made just under 90 videos covering a wide range of topics from major releases to international gaming events and brand-new hardware. My first year at RPS has been busy, basically. So when Katharine asked me to pull together a few of my personal highlights, I was kind of stumped. It's hard to pick favourites!

No one hops onto a website like this and says to themselves, \"Well now! I wonder what guides have been written today that I can spend my time reading through!\". The vast majority of people who read our guides come straight from a Google search into something specific like \"Can I romance Yennefer and Triss at the same time?\" (spoiler alert: you can, but it may not end well for you).\nBecause we operate so much behind the scenes, it's easy to miss some of the amazing stuff that the team did in guidestown this year. It ain't easy, writing a walkthrough or how-to that's useful for the reader while simultaneously appeasing those nebulous and mercurial SEO gods. But 2022 has been a stonkingly good year for guides, and I'd love to take a little bit of time to shine a light on some of the things we're most proud of having achieved this year - and to toast what will hopefully be another smashing year for guides in 2023!\n Read more",

It's a very enigmatic little game, but one that's instantly charming in its old-school vibes and artfully constructed world. Its soundtrack is a bit of a corker, too.\nRead more",

Often the original food/game/gesture/saying/joke/whatever had nothing to do with the event's core, and that doesn't matter. Sometimes it simply brings joy and feels right. For example, the use of 1956 pop song Green Door in free festive indie game Dracula Cha Cha feels so right that to me, it is a Christmas song. Green Door has run through my head for weeks, and it is once again time for the annual go on Dracula Cha Cha.\nRead more",

          "description": "I’m a big fan of life-sim mini-games. Cooking, crafting, mining, gardening, and all those other videogame-y tasks make something that's a bit mundane into a fun little treat. It looks like developers Niceplay Games agree, as they’ve taken the joy of tactile crafting and created an entire potion-brewing sim around it - and not only is their crafting system both creative and clever, it's oh so satisfying.\nWe've written about it before, but Potion Craft is out now. You play as an alchemist who has set up shop in an old wizard’s hut, ready to sell your many bubbling brews and concoctions to the locals. People will come by the shop during the day banging on about their problems, so you need to listen to each customer's issue, create an appropriate potion to help, and receive a lovely handful of gold in return. It’s essentially a shop management sim, since you make money, buy ingredients, and haggle to get a good deal. But the best part of Potion Craft is all in the title; it's getting to grips with the art of potion brewing.\nRead more",

It's worth writing about though, so here I am, doing that. It's a weirdo little first-person action-adventure game where you play as the 16-year-old Yaga, who has been run into the forest because the local villagers think she's in league with the witch Baba. If you know any European folklore you may have reason to suspect they're right.\nYaga's childhood friends have all vanished, along with her sister, and the game sends you off to breadcrumb trails around a bright, unreal forest, to find the memories of what happened to the unfortunate kiddies. Along the way you grow in power and skill, using different types of arrows with your bow, as well as lures and spells. I like Blacktail because it's a little bit janky in ways that don't break the game, and is absolutely committed to its own particular flavour of odd. It's the kind of game you used to see a lot in the early-mid 00s, and just don't get much anymore.\nRead more",

Yes, even more so than Half-Life 2. Maybe it’s the slower flying speed of the desk, giving you more time to anticipate the blow. Maybe it’s the recoil of the face. Or maybe it’s just how the desk, or whichever piece of office fixture you’re telekinetically hurling, impacts in a hilarious explosion of shards and scraps.\nRead more",

Having launched into early access in mid-October, the latest game from the Surviving Mars devs has just recently doubled in size to include a brand-new desert biome in its Dunes And Moons update, adding harsh temperature extremes to deal with, new alien lifeforms to observe, and, you know, just the odd Chaos Moon to endure while you're at it. \nThe world of Desertum is certainly a marked change from Stranded's initial mountainous forest planet, Sobrius, but after a few weeks of trying (and inevitably failing) to stay alive in them, I do feel like I've settled on a couple of vital dos and don'ts now. For example, Do: invest in defences early on. Don't: eat that weird alien zebra camel until you know whether it's going to give you gut rot. The list goes on, and has only grown larger with the addition of Desertum, which was deliberately designed to \"challenge players to plan better and not rely on their previous knowledge,\" Dyankov tells me. \"Our aim here has been to find a balance between the familiar and unfamiliar within the Desertum Biome, to ensure it's a challenging place to build your base, but is also enjoyable.\" I'll try to remember that the next time horned dinosaurs are gnawing my survivors' legs off.\nRead more",

You play as the dapper defence attorney Jayjay Falcon who alongside his witty lackey Sparrowson take on four seemingly unrelated cases. Travelling around Paris, you collect evidence and interview witnesses then present your findings in the courtroom and bring justice to your client.\nRead more",

          "description": "After all these years of going fast, it would appear that Sonic (T. Hedgehog) has finally arrived. He’s thrown off the shackles of individuality and joined the open-world herd with Sonic Frontiers, a game that sees the blue blur himself canter and gambol across primarily barren environments that closely resemble the default assets that ship with certain game engines. Do I seem embittered? Perish the thought. I’m happy for Sonic, honestly. He’s made it. He’s on top of the world right now, getting review scores he never could have dreamed of since the salad days of the Mega Drive. A Metacritic in the 70s! He may as well have been kissed on the nips by Jesus Christ himself. \r\n\n \nRead more",

Many came and went, and gradually, I've managed to whittle the crowd down to something resembling my ten favorite games of 2022.\nIt wasn't an easy task, to be honest. Sure, this year saw the delay of multiple big-name projects into 2023. I'm a bit grateful for that though, as it at least gave me time to spend on some smaller indie releases. And wow, did they come out swinging.\nThis year was the year of small games, tactics games, story-driven and narrative titles, and more.

          "description": "Case proceeding against Sonic the Hedgehog co-creator\nFormer Sega veteran Yuji Naka has been formally indicted following their arrest earlier this month for suspected insider trading. The indictment was reported yesterday by Japan's NHK news corporation.\nNaka was first arrested in November as part of an investigation into insider trading at studio Square Enix, led by the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors’ Office Investigation Department. Naka, along with two further SE employees named as Taisuke Sazaki and Fumiaki Suzuki, was arrested under suspicion of purchasing stock in Japanese studio Aiming, right before Square announced that the developer was working on a new title in the Dragon Quest series, Dragon Quest: Tact.\nAt the start of December, Naka was re-arrested after the investigation uncovered further evidence suggesting that the Sonic the Hedgehog co-creator had purchased 120,000 shares in developer ATeam ahead of the announcement that said studio would be producing mobile release Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier. The shares in question were valued at around ¥144.7 million yen ($834,000 USD).\n\"We have been fully cooperating with requests from the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission,\" said Square Enix in a statement published in November. “As the investigation by the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office is underway, we will continue to fully cooperate with their investigation.\"\n\"We deeply regret the great concern this has caused to all concerned. We have dealt with this incident strictly, including internal disciplinary actions taken against the suspected employees.\"\nIt is currently not known when or if Naka will stand trial for these charges. Yuji Naka left Square Enix in 2021, following the critical and commercial failure Balan Wonderworld. Naka would later file suit against Square Enix, arguing that they had removed him from development six months ahead of release.\nThe post Yuji Naka indicted on Square Enix insider trading charges appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "And that's not even including The Big N\nAs the year's end shuffles into view, number-crunching firms are taking a look back at the last 12 months to recognize patterns, facts, and figures as they pertain to gaming, retail, prices, sales, and player behavior — And a new report from the statisticians at NewZoo offers up some interesting reading.\nNewZoo places its estimate for the global games market value at a staggering $184.4 billion USD. This accounts for almost game sales, on PC, console, and mobile platforms. It should also be noted that this already impressive figure does not take into account Nintendo game sales, as the publisher has always been weirdly prudish when it comes to revealing its own bottom line.\n\nOf this total market value, $51.8 billion manifested through console games, with a further $38.2 billion pulled in by downloaded/boxed PC titles, and $2.3 billion from browser-based PC games. Of course, mobile gaming takes the lion's share, with a massive $92.2 billion in total revenue. This sector was led by the continued dominance of titles such as TiMi Studios' Honor of Kings, and PUBG Corporation's PUBG Mobile, which continue to earn billions year-on-year from the global market.\nWhen it comes specifically to console gaming, around 72% of all game sales were digital downloads, with only the remained 28% accounting for physical releases. This continues a trend we have witnessed for many years now, with each consecutive year seeing more and more customers opting for digital game purchases over boxed copies. Again, this figure does not include Nintendo Switch software, which represents perhaps the last real bastion of high-street retail gaming purchases.\nThe post Over 70% of all game sales in 2022 were digital downloads appeared first on Destructoid.",

Reddit user Few_Working3350 has apparently located an ad, which showcases some form of Nintendo Switch Online functionality for the game.\nThe ad seems to be Dutch in origin, with the standard marketing phrase \"Haal meer uit je Nintendo Switch,\" which roughly translates to \"get more out of your Nintendo Switch!\" The ad then highlights some form of Switch Online functionality, with a big banner. If true, it could be anything; possibly even some form of asynchronous mechanic similar to the Souls series. It could also be an erroneous local ad that explains that you can connect online and download future DLC. We've reached out to Nintendo for clarification on the matter.\n\nWe're still half a year away from Tears of the Kingdom\nThe next big entry in the Zelda franchise is due out on May 13, 2023, and you can bet we'll be seeing some showcases for it: maybe as early as this January.\nNintendo has a lot of confidence going into this release given all the good will they've generated from Breath of the Wild, so this seems like it'll be a pretty easy slam dunk.

That is to say, it occupies the same territory as games such as High Hell, Ghostrunner, and SuperHOT where the speed, accuracy, and efficiency of the player's movement are equally as important as simply staying alive.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Yr9olh1yqk&ab_channel=Digerati\nSet in a future-noir world, players control the vengeance-fuelled protagonist Steel, who has lost an arm to an accident manufactured by the omnipotent corporation EdenSys. Outfitted with an energy cannon to replace the missing limb, Steel sets out on a one-woman-vendetta against EdenSys, eradicating its operations and liberating those crushed beneath its metal heels. This translates to a slickly designed, hugely destructible environments and highly stylized and explosive FPS action, all backed by a fantastic, adrenaline-pumping score.\nSo If you fancy ringing a few ears as you ring in the new year, then head on over to Epic Games Store right now and bag Severed Steel gratis, you have just a few more hours before it will be replaced by the next offering.

My brain is full.\nSo, allow me to spill my brain all over the page here, as I recount the games that left the most lasting scars in 2022. Fortunately, this also doubles as a list of developers who should be paying for the therapy that keeps me going as a borderline functional member of society.\n\nHappy’s Humble Burger Farm\nThis game technically came out in 2021, but it was December, so it wasn’t considered for Destructoid’s Game of the Ye…",

          "description": "A scarce commodity\nDo you own a jar of my toenail clippings? Not many people do. They’re a scarce commodity, but scarcity is a daft reason to own anything. It’s hardwired into our brain that if there are few of something, we want it more. We know it as the “fear of missing out,” and it’s one of the most annoying subsets of greed.\nVideo game collecting is a pretty innocuous embodiment of this. To my knowledge, no wars have been fought over a copy of Snatcher on the Sega CD. However, it’s still rather annoying. I collect games because they are a tangible representation of the game. I like to play them. Don’t give me a factory-sealed game, because I will open it. I don’t want to look down on anyone else’s reasoning for why they collect games, but I can’t help but find it ridiculous that some …",

As is our yearly tradition, we figured we'd check in with the community and see how everyone's Christmas is going.\nAs for me, friends of the family picked us up the Super Nintendo Entertainment System ornament from Hallmark, which is going next to our Minecraft one. My wife grabbed me an accompanying Raccoon Mario ornament, as well as a few goodies for my ever-growing tabletop collection. The little bands on the bottom of the header image are for keeping open board game boxes shut, and the case at the top is a Quiver: for holding game cards. I gifted myself a red DualSense PS5 controller earlier this week on sale, since we could use a third one for our kid.\nI've been playing a lot of Marvel Champions, Arkham Horror: The Card Game, and Lord of the Rings: The Card game this year, so both of those accessories will come in handy. Video game-wise we've been playing a lot of couples games lately, including the recently-released Escape Academy DLC, as well as Operation Tango.\nThere's a lot of opportunities to clean up on some video game-related gifts this year, but the tabletop industry is adjacent enough to share if you want!

YA!\nThe wallet-troubling merchandisers over at Good Smile Co. have opened pre-orders on the next gaming superstar joining its enormous range of ridiculously adorable Nendoroid figurines — And this time around, it's a true icon of the medium, with the coming of Street Fighter legend Chun-Li!\n\nAs with all Nendoroid releases, Chun-Li stands a dinky 100mm in height, (that's just under four inches), and comes complete with a stand and several faceplates and accessories — allowing fans to stage The Strongest Woman in The World in all manner of dynamic poses. The additional Faceplates include a business face, a cute smile, and even a tearful expression, though why you'd use that is beyond me. Accessories include alternate hands, a Kikoken fireball, and Chunner's famous Lightning Legs kick!\n\nIf you'd like your own pocket-sized Chun-Li to stand guard over your desk, then you can pre-order her right now over at the official Good Smile Co. store and other toy retailers. Nendoroid Chun-Li retails for ¥8,400, (or roughly $58 USD), not including shipping, handling, or any potential customs charges. Chun-Li is expected to ship in the summer of 2023. Surprisingly, this is only the first of the Street Fighter Nendoroids.

Patch 6.3 for Final Fantasy XIV is due to arrive on January 10, 2023, bringing new story and raid content, as well as many other changes and additions.\nThe trailer shown off today during the Live Letter spotlights what the protagonist, or Warrior of Light, will be getting up to as the main story content continues. We see newer addition to the cast Zero a fair bit, but it also looks like Alisae and Alphinaud will be involved too.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVQtvBIdv4Y\nWe also see some of the new raid content coming to Final Fantasy XIV's current 24-player raid series, Myths of the Realm. Seems the gods will continue to test players, and I'm really digging the bits we saw of their arenas.\nHome sweet Island Sanctuary\nOf course, a Final Fantasy XIV patch is a grand affair, and there's much more on the way too. As outlined on the Patch 6.3 site, there are updates to Tataru's Grand Endeavor, additional Duty support, and both a new Unreal Trial and Ultimate Raid. It seems like XIV players who like the high-end content will have their hands full with the new update.\nBut if you prefer a quiet life, in the sanctity of a peaceful island, there's something for you too. The Island Sanctuary is getting an update, which will include a new landmark, and some big quality-of-life changes that Square Enix's Naoki Yoshida outlines during the Live Letter. Picking up all leavings and yields in one fell swoop is going to be a game-changer.\nWhile the holidays may just be getting started, Final Fantasy XIV looks poised to ring in the new year with a big patch. We'll see where the MSQ goes, and maybe head back to our islands for a little maintenance, on January 10, 2023.\nThe post Final Fantasy XIV Patch 6.3 arrives on January 10 appeared first on Destructoid.",

And to celebrate the occasion, Sony Interactive Entertainment and Polyphony Digital released a video message, thanking the community and the team for delivering over two decades of critically acclaimed racing action.\nThe first Gran Turismo launched on PlayStation on December 23, 1997, kicking off a franchise that aimed to bring a sense of realism and technical authenticity to the racing game genre. With the ever-evolving technology of PlayStation hardware, developer Polyphony Digital has been afforded the opportunity to push the envelope further and further, with sequels boasting increasingly photo-realistic visuals and immersive driving physics almost unparalleled in the genre.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zIcBFcLM7U&ab_channel=GRANTURISMOTV\nA lengthy letter from Polyphony Digital CEO Kazunori Yamauchi, released for the anniversary, reflects on the history of the franchise, while also revealing that a staggering 90 million Gran Turismo titles have been sold since the series' debut. Yamauchi speaks of his and the Polyphony team's immense pride in the franchise, noting that the studio still carries a sense of revitalized determination into the current and forthcoming gaming generations.\n\"I can’t ever thank enough the Gran Turismo users and people of the Gran Turismo community who have played our new titles, which at times could be said to have been very experimental, writes Yamauchi. \"We are here today because of all the people who supported us. I believe the Gran Turismo series have always pursued “beauty.” The beauty of the cars, the beauty of the scenery, the beauty of the lighting, the beauty of driving, the beauty of sounds/music and the beauty of the graphics.\"\n\"The “pursuit of beauty” is the motivation for creating Gran Turismo.\"\nThe post Gran Turismo celebrates 90 million sales in 25th Anniversary message appeared first on Destructoid.",

As we see Shaun practicing his very finest ragdoll efforts, he tells us that he has been keeping busy between games — cutting to a montage of Shaun in action, which includes a clip of the controversial GTA VI dev footage, leaked earlier this year.\nWhile this is not the first time the Goat Simulator crew has referenced another developer for satirical fun, Rockstar Games — as billion-dollar companies are wont to do — clearly didn't see the funny side. The ad in question has since been pulled from all official outlets, with even reuploads posted to Twitter and other social media sites by members of the public being shut down as quickly as they appear.\nRockstar Games is still shining from the theft and broadcast of the (clearly very, very early) development footage. The videos were allegedly stolen in September directly from the company's own Slack channels by a 17-year-old hacker, who, is it also claimed, had planned to extort the publisher, but instead found himself in the bad books and black vans of the feds. The suspect is expected to appear in a high court at a later date.\nGoat Simulator 3, which does not feature any GTA VI source code , (that we know of) is available now on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X.\nThe post Goat Simulator 3 ad pulled for including leaked GTA VI footage appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Have yourself a Cowabunga Christmas...\nHot on the heels of yesterday's update for Konami's TMNT: The Cowabunga Collection, publisher Dotemu has announced a new patch for Tribute Games' great brawler TMNT: Shredder's Revenge. Now available on all platforms, the update adds a variety of fun modes and features to the retro scrapper.\nFirst and foremost, the new Custom Game mode allows hosts to tweak a variety on in-game options in order to fine-tune their Shredder-smashing experience. Players can now take on fast enemies, play as the same characters, turn up the difficulty, switch out health for supers, and even access infinite credits for shellfish ease. It should be noted that turning on any of these extra options rules out leaderboard access, or the unlocking of achievements.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GemOAwU-9fo&ab_channel=Dotemu\nAdditionally, some fun new filters have been made available, allowing for players to give the screen the curved, pixelated look of an arcade monitor, or a '90s-tastic, bleeding-color style of a VCR tape. Radical. In regards to online play, a new option will allow the host to dictate the amount of players allowed to join a game, from two to four. Guest players can also rejoin previously left games.\nImportantly, the new update brings a host of tweaks, balance changes, and bug fixes to Shredder's Revenge. While many were happy to praise the game for its authentic retro style and attention to detail, many critics and fans have papered over the litany of bugs that ruin an otherwise great experience. Fortunately, this new patch addresses a variety of problems — from random crashes and vanishing bosses, to broken scores and input glitches. Additionally, a small selection of player and enemy moves have been buffed/nerfed, in order to provide a tighter, fairer experience.\nTMNT: Shredder's Revenge is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.\nThe post TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge update adds custom options, filters, and more appeared first on Destructoid.",

And if they wanted a reason to start it all over again, they'll have it later on in 2023 too. Sony Santa Monica confirms that New Game Plus is coming to God of War Ragnarok next spring.\n\"We know many of you have been asking, so we're happy to confirm that New Game Plus will be coming to God of War Ragnarok in Spring 2023!\" the tweet reads. More details will be shared closer to the mode's actual release.\nhttps://twitter.com/SonySantaMonica/status/1605971630609539073\nNo details have been given as to what the mode will officially entail. The 2018 reboot of God of War also got a New Game Plus mode down the line, so we can extrapolate a bit from that. The previous God of War's NG+ included a difficulty option, a handful of new armor sets and abilities, and some new attack patterns for enemies. It'll be interesting to see how much Ragnarok carries into its own New Game Plus, because the 2018 God of War's version is pretty hefty.\nA new father-son adventure\nOn top of the New Game Plus mode, support has been rolling out steadily for God of War Ragnarok. Recently, Sony Santa Monica added a photo mode into the options. And early patches have hit a sizeable number of tweaks and fixes.\nIt's Sony's big game for the end of the year. But it's nice to see that Ragnarok will carry on into 2023, too. Hopefully fans get a little extra fun out of the game when the New Game Plus rolls out.\nThe post God of War Ragnarok will get New Game Plus in spring 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

After more than 150 hours roaming the Lands Between, I feel the familiar bittersweetness that occurs anytime I finish a game I love. I’d conquered unimaginable horrors and become Elden Lord in my own personalized adventure, all while cruising atop a cool double-jumping steed; now what? Recovering from this high would become a personal struggle for the remainder of the year.\nElden Ring dominated my life. When I wasn’t playing it, it was the only thing I wanted to do. When I chipped away at other games for work or pleasure, tasks like gaining access to Raya Lucaria Academy or conquering Malenia were in the back of my mind. I stopped eating Red Lobster because it caused me to suffer terrible flashbacks of getting relentless…",

Its minigame-centric fights and awkward movement were damning, but it also lacked the silly, over-the-top violence Mortal Kombat is known for – a sad reality for appeasing license holder Warner Bros. Batman can cripple impoverished criminals, but he can’t be cut in half by Tarkatan blades.\nIt would have been disappointing to end on an ill-fated crossover, but Midway’s untimely demise could have made that so. Layoffs, uncertainty, and publisher implosion aren’t how franchises live; it’s how they die. But the then-newly formed NetherRealm Studios reinvigorated the entire franchise after its darkest period with one of its most beloved entries: the 2011 reboot, Mortal Kombat 9. Read more...",

I have vague memories of seeing a TV commercial for the original PlayStation game when I was young and remember playing the game’s first few hours in a friend’s attic between Mat Hoffman’s Pro BMX sessions. It wasn’t until much later, when I found an inexpensive green label copy at a Circuit City, that I gave it another shot, but, again, I only made it through the first few hours. When Square Enix released it in such a way that I could play it on my PlayStation 3 and move it over to my PSP, I made it the furthest.

As one of the most profitable games in arcade history, Street Fighter II drew more than its fair share of quarters and tokens during the arcade heyday. But the franchise transcends that one moment in time. To say that Street Fighter has sparked multiple revolutions in its genre throughout its history is not far-fetched.\nArcades aren’t omnipresent the way they once were, but the Street Fighter name has endured the ever-shifting grounds of the games industry. The fierce fistfights made the leap from mall game rooms to the living room, the internet, and even tournaments broadcast to massive, international audiences. As the franchise turns 35 years old, we met with the people involved to understand the series’ origins and how it remains relevant three-and-a-half decades later. Read more...",

The gamble paid off in spades.

Opting for DLC as opposed to a full-on sequel, the Cuphead developer set about outlining The Delicious Last Course, released in June 2022.

They follow the same story to the same conclusion, meeting the same characters and feeling many of the same feelings. They experience the same vision of a post-apocalyptic United States, where one traumatized man, Joel, reckons with his inability to part with his surrogate daughter, Ellie.\nBut even a remake sticking as close to the original script and general design of its original as Part I is, ultimately, a new game in its own right.

Series creator Yoko Taro is also involved with the project. \nThe series is in production at A-1 Pictures, a subsidiary of Aniplex. In the past, the production house has worked on series such as Black Butler, Your Lie in April, Fate, and Sword Art Online. Ver1.1a is being directed by Ryoji Masuyama, who's previously worked on KILL la KILL, Evangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance and Evangelion: 3.0+1.01 Thrice Upon a Time, as well as Gurren Lagann.\nNieR:Automata Ver1.1a will begin airing in Japan on January 7, 2023.

          "description": "Publisher Deep Silver revealed Dead Island 2 in 2014 and Los Angeles was its primary setting (with a tease in the game’s logo that San Francisco might be in it as well). Fans were excited about the sequel for several reasons – that original reveal trailer was great – but the question on many minds was this: Why is Dead Island 2 set somewhere that’s not an island? \nI traveled to Nottingham, England to visit Dambuster Studios, and this was one of the first questions I asked. Unsurprisingly, considering this is the team that's been developing this game since 2018, lead narrative designer Khan had an in-depth answer. \nSimply put, Los Angeles has become an island, metaphorically speaking. \nDead Island 2 begins in the final days of the evacuation of LA after the zombie outbreak has swept through…",

The surprise launch comes a month and a half after the developer gave us a December 2022 release window for the long-awaited follow up to its 2017 smash hit, Golf Story.\nGolf Story provided players a retro-styled RPG with a zany story centered around golf of all kinds: regular, disc, and more. Sports Story sees SideBar Games expand the formula to include various other athletic events, including BMX, tennis, cricket, soccer, volleyball, fishing, and more. If you loved the golf of Golf Story, don't worry: That sport carries over to Sports Story, bringing with it eight unique golf courses. \nYou can see the full video, which also provides updates for Sea of Stars, Undying, and Dust & Neon, below.\n\n\nGolf Story, SideBar Games' predecessor to Sports Story, arrived on Switch on September 28, 2017. In our review, we called it \"a breath of fresh air for sports, and another fun story to follow for role-playing fanatics,\" awarding it a 9 out of 10. Sports Story was initially announced by SideBar Games in December 2019, with long stretches of silence from the development team. Then, during last month's Indie World Showcase from Nintendo, the developers finally announced that the game would arrive at some point in December 2022.\nSports Story is available now for Switch.",

As for what to expect, though, that remains unknown – Santa Monica Studio says it'll \"share more details once we get closer to the release.\" \n\n\nWhile many had hoped Ragnarök would launch with a New Game Plus mode built-in, its arrival after the game's release isn't surprising. God of War (2018) received its New Game Plus mode after launch as well. For now, we wait until next spring. \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer's God of War Ragnarök review and then read about how the game's director fought to keep its most unexpected and cartoonish character in the game. Check out this story about how Kratos voice actor Christopher Judge originally quit when he learned someone else was directing Ragnarök after that and then read about how Amazon Prime Video has ordered a God of War TV series set during the Norse era. \nAre you going to replay God of War Ragnarök using this New Game Plus mode next year?

In this case, we’re replaying one of the greatest games of the PS1 era, Silent Hill! Join us live on Twitch today at 3 p.m. Central as we endure two hours of nostalgic, hair-raising scares. If you can’t catch us live, each episode will be available to watch on Saturdays on the Game Informer Shows YouTube channel. \nEpisode 1 - The Harry Mason Shuffle\nEpisode 2- When Doves Cry\nEpisode 3 - Bible.\nEpisode 4 - Age Seven, Short, Black Hair\n\n\nIn 1999, Konami put the fear of fog in a generation of players with the release of Silent Hill. The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that's (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later.\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

Many have been anticipating this long-awaited sequel since its original reveal back in 2014, just a few years following the franchise's start. That's why I went to Nottingham, England, to go hands-on with the game for more than seven hours. And soon, you can read everything I learned because Dead Island 2 bloodies up this month's cover of Game Informer. \nGame Informer video editor Alex Van Aken and I visited Dambuster Studios in Nottingham to play two extensive portions of Dead Island 2, talk with the game's director about its development and why the team started with a blank slate, learn from the narrative lead about why a game with \"island\" in its name is set in…",

Now that he’s reached the top of the mountain, the series is giving the perpetually young hero his last hurrah before kicking off a fresh adventure starring a new cast of characters.\n\n\nThe Pokémon Company announced that beginning January 13 (in Japan), Ash and Pikachu’s final chapter begins. It consists of 11 special episodes serving as a grand send-off celebrating the duo's achievements. It also features some familiar faces from Ash’s past, including Misty and Brock.\nSometime later in the year, a new yet-to-be-titled animated series set in Scarlet/Violet’s Paldea region kicks offs. It stars two young trainers, Liko and Roy, joined by the three starters of that region: Sprigatito, Fuecoco, and Quaxly. The trailer also teases the appearance of a shiny Rayquaza.\nSo this is it. If you spent your childhood following Ash's exploits or have stuck with him for his entire run, how does it feel to finally see the character get his flowers and ride off into the sunset?

Evath's moon Mitral has turned into a gigantic gas time bomb. A meteor is also due to impact Mitral in the next several hours. You were chosen to secure each of Mitral's 18 sectors by positioning a drilling rig over the gas pockets in each sector before the meteor strikes.\nSolve challenging riddles by relying on geological clues, intuition, or good old trial and error. To survive your mission, find Rubicon crystals to restore energy and destroy (or avoid) the Laser Beacons and Skanners left behind by the Ketars. Good luck!\nOur reimplemented engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Driller support is limited to DOS (EGA mode), Amiga and AtariST releases, but we hope to be able to add more soon! Please contact us if you have some other release.\nTo play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build.
