Taiji is another one that we'd bundle into this group, a 2D open-world puzzler that arrives on the eShop on 25th February.\nThe game's solo developer, Matthew VanDevander, was very open about its Witness inspiration when it launched on Steam back in 2022, and we can see why. This is a game where you explore a mysterious world, solving a series of grid-based puzzles as you go. Taiji switches The Witness' first-person perspective to a top-down, 2D pixel art, but the answers-hidden-in-plain-sight approach is all still present and correct.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

With Bombservice specifically, the team has always boasted a strong understanding of what makes Metroidvanias ‘click’, and with Momodora: Moonlit Farewell, it’s delivered what may well be its finest game yet.\nThe latest chronological entry in the series, Moonlit Farewell is a noticeable step up from its already-excellent predecessor, Reverie Under the Moonlight, in terms of scope, visual design, and gameplay. Right from the start, you’re greeted by stunning scenes of pixel-art wizardry, with Bombservice showcasing its mastery of colour and atmosphere.

It is a hypnotically involving game of picking up hitchhikers and battling tailgaters, a pixel art drivealong with tactile, chunky buttons and perfectly suited sound effects, as much fuelled by nostalgia as it is by gasoline.

It was a baffling piece of licensed merch from Disco Elysium studio ZA/UM and Atelier, who I assume are three hyenas in a board room sniffing each other's crotches for eternity.\nI couldn't tell you exactly where I first saw the bag - which has actually been on sale for a few months now - but I soon realised why it had likely entered the zeitgeist again: an extensive set of a documentary podcasts by YouTube creator The 41st Precinct, the latest of which interviews writers Dora Klindžić and Argo Tuulik for more time than I have ever spent on anything.

There’s also a standalone benchmark tool that you can download from the game’s Steam page, so you can see for yourself how the beast-biffing RPG will run on your hardware.\nIn theory, these are great developments. Lower requirements mean a more widely accessible game, and the benchmark tool – which covers a good six minutes of combined cinematics and simulated free roaming – brings reassurance and accountability to this otherwise hype-reliant prerelease period. Sadly, there are two problems. One, the benchmark confirms outright that Monster Hunter Wilds will run like stagnant goulash on low-end PCs, and two, it does so to the extent that I’m not sure that the revised minimum specs are even reliable.\nRead more",

This ends the fight immediately. Sometimes I resort to this low move out of frustration, when a dull fight has dragged on for too long. Sometimes I resort to it out of panic, because I’ve accidentally set fire to every hard surface within ten feet, or frozen myself to a wall. Often it’s just for the pleasure of it. \r\n\nIn Eternal Strands, Yellow Brick Games’ debut title, you play the leader of a \"weaver band\", a crew of freelance magicians, in a world where something extremely bad happened to magic. Some years ago, the Enclave, a city state acting as the isolationist heart of the world’s magic, exploded in a kind of power surge - one part tsunami, one part blown fuse - and just as quickly sealed itself off from the world outside. Somehow managing to breach the wall, your band finds themselves the first people to set foot inside the ruined capital since the calamity and sets about uncovering the mystery of what exactly went wrong. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "I was initially sceptical that we'd be seeing dark fantasy strategy RPG Whispers Of The Eyeless any time soon. I follow the game's creator Venris on YouTube. He's co-developing this with Evil Gingerbread Studio but his other big project is the Total War: Warhammer III overhaul mod SFO, and it seems barely a month passes without some huge update to that. Venris once told me he mods for around \"eight to 12 hours a day\", though, so I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that this cult-shepherding roguelite is now available in Steam early access. Edwin described it as \"Darkest Dungeon, but you're running the dungeon\". That's better than anything I could come up with, so let's stick with that.\nRead more",

They've previously put out things like a replica of Kim Kitsuragi's jacket. I'm not going to link them, as a pathetic act of rebellion.\nAs the man who couldn't afford an ambulance to get the gash on his head sewn up once said, let's try and keep an open mind about this.

She greets him like a nobleman. I have Henry push back. He's a blacksmith's son. He might have some blue blood care of his biological father, but he grew up in the soot and clamour of the forge. The girl nervously insists, however: Henry must be from the upper crust, or he wouldn't have been welcomed and feasted by the lord of the estate. He wouldn't be lying in his very own chamber with its very own hole for shitting in - and in any case, it's more than her job's worth to treat him otherwise.

This peaked in Clive Barker's Jericho, a shooter so desaturated it felt like the colour settings on your monitor were banjaxed.

It is, in fact, a rather nifty collection of upscaling improvements that can help out older graphics cards as readily as the very newest, while building on DLSS 3’s frame generation tool with Multi Frame Generation (MFG) to send visual smoothness skyrocketing. If you care even the slightest iota for how your PC performs in modern games, DLSS 4 demands your attention.\nHere, then, I’ll break down DLSS 4’s various tricks and components, looking at how they really affect performance – and whether it’s worth upgrading your rig to maximise compatibility with it.\nRead more",

          "description": "Hidden away on NASA's Golden Record, an interstellar archive of music, image and sound, there is a recording of a poem by Charles Baudelaire, Élévation, which describes the astral ascent of the soul. Well, part of a poem. Both to free up room on the disc and perhaps, to edit out \"the vast sorrows and all the vexations\" of the second half, only the first two stanzas appear. The recording in fact ends halfway through a line, which conjures up an intriguing problem for the listener, inasmuch as the thwarted rhyme scheme reveals that the piece is incomplete. A poetically-minded alien might be tempted to fill in the gap. A fancier alien who took a module in postmodernism might hail the poetics of the fragment. A resolutely practical alien who thinks poetry is for losers might read the whole thing, instead, as a set of incoherent navigational prompts, made up of loose prepositions - au-dessus, au-dessus, par delà, par delà.\r\n \nRead more",

Happily, all these ray tracing and frame generation accoutrements seemingly won’t preclude Spidey 2 from working on older, slower PCs as well, as the minimum specs are surprisingly reasonable.\nGranted, they’re only rated for 30fps at a lowly 720p, and you’ll still need to find a honking 140GB of SSD space, but the basic GPU and CPU requirements aren’t too lofty at all. The likes of an RTX 3060 for 60fps/1080p are quite reasonable as well, though you’re staring down the barrel of Nvidia’s pricey RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 cards for high-rez ray tracing.\nRead more",

The only princes you shall acknowledge are their royal highnesses Distance, Wind, and Timing.\nYou may or may not find all that \"soothing\" - I won't judge. I will only repeat Nic's observation from the Maw that Sniper At Work look \"a bit like Commandos, a bit like Hitman\", which I would translate to \"my comrade in PC gaming, if historic audience trends are any indication you shall do well here\".

          "description": "Continuing last week's Maw merchandising roll-out, may I introduce by popular demand the first official Maw-endorsed letter opener. Now now, don't act coy! I know some of you are old enough to know what a letter opener is, or even to own one. Statistically, most of the RPS readership are Lich Lords. The Maw letter opener differs from regular letter openers in that when you open a letter with it, you will encounter not a letter but a perfect copy of yourself opening a letter in the opposite direction. The two of you must now fight to the death to decide who is the letter-opener and who is the letter. It's yours for a piffling three pints of any available body fluid, but if you don't want to buy a letter opener you can always buy one of this week's new PC games instead.\r\n \nRead more",

In fairness to Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, which Nic says can be great as a game per se, it does make some effort at settling into Windows. It has rebindable M+K controls. It has DLSS. It has generally more consistent framerates than FFXVI, which could bait you in with silky visuals before grabbing your head and shoving it into the cold ice bath of sub-30fps.\nYet it also steps back from that game on its supported tech, while raising its hardware requirements so far above Final Fantasy 7 Remake that it won’t even launch on a lot of older graphics cards. Even so, hitching and microstuttering issues from FF7 Remake return once more, along with plenty of other signs that this PC version didn’t get the love that a lot of other erstwhile PlayStation exclusives – like Horizon Forbidden West or God of War Ragnarök – did for their ports.\nRead more",

Have Ubi delivered? I think there's a strong chance.

It was an \"I'm Spartacus\"-ass day of press releases, culminating in the announcement of a project from former ZA/UM writers Argo Tuulik and Olga Moskvina.\nBefore that came sci-fi RPG XXX Nightshift, and before that was an unnamed \"psychogeographic RPG\" from newly formed Longdue. We now know that it's called Hopetown, and Longdue are set to launch a crowdfunding campaign which you can \"pre-register\" for here, should you wish. Here's the sell:\nRead more",

Here is a compact selection of ski slopes, each one yodeling the promise of my smooth and exhilarating descent over fresh powder. But wait, someone has littered this Ski Sunday with obstacles, forcing me to run a gauntlet of trees, rocks and rivers. I am thrust headlong into each of these obstacles a dozen times before my withered synapses and tired bones internalise these arboreal teachings and I make it safely to the bottom.\r\n\nAs in life, there is joy to be found in this journey precisely because it is hard.

          "description": "Readers, I have spent two full days in the benchmark pits to tell you what you've already guessed: the GeForce RTX 5090 is very fast, too expensive, and laden with more AI tech than Philip K. Dick’s cheese dreams. At least two of those points will, I’m sure, send the average graphics card shopper running, especially at a time when even game developers are growing suspicious of generative AI and its many-thumbed, robot-voiced nostrums.\nYet while there’s not much to be done about the RTX 5090 costing at minimum £1939 / $1999, hundreds more than the infamously spenny RTX 4090, its suite of more purely performance-focused artificial intelligence tools is – dare I say it – quite neat. These range from Multi Frame Generation (MFG), which is basically DLSS 3 frame gen but up to twice as fast, to DLSS 4’s general upscaling enhancements and even the ability to apply newer DLSS versions to older games. All this will come to the rest of the RTX 50 series as well, with some trickling down to the enter RTX range, so maybe the RTX 5090 is best understood not as a practical GPU purchase in itself but as a Picadilly Square-filling advert for its more affordable siblings can do.\nRead more",

Lili looks a lot like the interactive drama popularised by Sam Barlow's Her Story and Telling Lies. Except this has the added twist of being set in contemporary Iran.

          "description": "Kuroku's Basket Showdown has a very fun style system, which gives you a few more options during matches. Depending on which style you use, you can get higher jumps, better passes, and even special moves that guarantee shots. Before you know which Styles you should aim for, you need to know what they do. Thus, we've prepared a list of all of them. Here are all the Styles in Kuroku's Basket Showdown.\n\n\nKuroku's Basket Showdown All Styles\n\n\nThere are currently four styles in Kuroku's Basket Showdown. Two rare, one epic, and one legendary. You've guessed it: to get the epic and the legendary one, you'll need to play the gacha. Thankfully, you can earn money to buy gacha spins just by playing the game, and there is even a pity system in place. Here's what each style has:\n\n\nStyle name\nAbilities\n\n\n\nKuroku (Rare)\nMisdirection: Become invulnerable and dash sideways (even through opponent players).\nVanish Drive: Same as Misdirection but you dash forward.\n\n\n\nTepei (Rare)\nHook Shot: Shoot a ball at the hoop from the side. Great if you get cornered by opponents.\nAuto Pass: Aim at a teammate and pass them the ball without fail. Super useful.\n\n\n\nAomino (Epic)\nFormless Shot: Aim at the hoop, and activate an automatic shot that's unblockable while airborne\nBack Spin: Dash forward and Ankle Break any opponent that tries to steal your ball. Similar to Vanish Drive but more powerful.\nAwakening Move: Dribble through other players as you move at a high speed. You stun anyone you pass throught.\n\n\n\nKagame (Legendary)\nJump: Guess what you do here? Jump super high and block/intercept almost any airborne ball.\nDunk: Slam-dunk a ball while in range. Boomshakalaka! \nAwakening Move: Perform an unblockable dunk if another player passes you the ball while you are near the opponent's hoop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's all other is to it.

In the midst of thousands of players stepping back into the boots of Henry, developer Warhorse Studios has been getting praise from one of the industry's biggest names.\n\n\nIn a recent post on X, CD Projekt Red posted to its Witcher account to wish congratulations on the release of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. The heartfelt message also wishes for your blade to \"always be sharp,\" and is accompanied by a friendly image of Geralt of Rivia embracing young Henry in what I can only describe as something the cool kids may refer to as some sort of \"bromance.\" Correct me if I'm wrong, obviously.\n\n\n\n\nWarhorse itself posted a response under this post, thanking CDPR for the kudos, adding that the team was \"raising a glass to you now.\"\n\n\nKingdom Come: Johnny Silverhand edition\n\n\nInterpret it as some sort of corporate publicity thing if you will, but it is quite nice to see some of gaming's biggest studios giving props when new titles come out. It probably helps that The Witcher and Kingdom Come series both have similar vibes and aesthetics. Watch out for a mod that plops Geralt right into the heart of Bohemia [citation needed].\n\n\nAs mentioned above, Deliverance 2 has been doing pretty well within the last 24 hours. According to recent data from SteamDB – which tracks all things related to Steam – the game peaked at nearly 160,000 players since yesterday. At the time of writing, about 130,000 Henries (plural) are adventuring.\n\n\nBy the way, if it's been a while since you played the original or you're completely new to the series (as I am), the studio very handily put out of Story Recap video recently.

That said, I have to admit that the new Nether activity feels awesome, and most of the community seems to agree.\n\n\nThere have been hints and murmurs about the potential quality of Destiny 2: Malice, granted. I very nearly fell off the Destiny ride myself a little while back: a decision that was only supported by the fact that Destiny 2: Revenant wasn't all that good. Thankfully, Malice is kicking things off with a bang, and Nether is currently the rather excellent capstone to the whole thing. In the broadest sense possible, The Nether is a kind of a mash-up between the Menagerie and The Coil, with a tiny bit of Onslaught thrown in for good measure…",

Mělo to mít nějakou jinou \"message\" než \"když jsi psychopatický gangster, špatně dopadneš\"? Ale docela to uteklo. Jednoznačné mínus a nechtěný (zřejmě?) humor tkví ve skutečnosti, že hlavní hrdinka (t.j. žena) pořád vypadá jako nabušený chlap v paruce a během celého filmu to žádné jiné postavě nepřijde divné.
