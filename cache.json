          "description": "There’s no plaice like home.\nNew Zealand indie studio Black Salt’s Dredge surfaced in a highly mysterious trailer in 2022. All we saw was a small boat chugging around torrid seas, terrorised by Lovecraftian looming skies and giant, tentacled monsters. A later trailer showed a fisherman catching ever larger fish, selling them for ever larger amounts of money, and upgrading his boat as he went. Those ideas together sum up Dredge: a fish-sell-upgrade loop in a foreboding horror-mystery setting. It’s the latest thing to be washed up on the shores of iconic indie publisher Team17 – but is it just tragic flotsam, or is it some kind of cool mutant merman thing?\nWe’re happy to report that it’s very much the latter. Although the core loop is not the most original, the set dressing of cosmic fear, ferocious monsters and terrifyingly plumbable depths make all the difference. The story begins with a fisherman running afoul of jagged rocks. Despite being at the foot of a lighthouse, the rocks seem to appear from nowhere. The mayor of the nearby town loans the fisherman a boat and introduces him to the local fish market and shipyard. And here you take the helm. Controlling your little vessel with left-stick tank controls, you seek out bubbling spots on the water's surface. A brief action sub-mini-game moment catches fish, and then you can pootle on back to the dock to sell your haul of tiddlers. Upgrading at the shipyard gets new rods for catching more varied fishies from further afield and all in all it’s a jolly old time in the salty sun on the ocean wave. Until nighttime.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "“Imagine someone saying ‘We need you to make a trailer for our movie, but we've only got half of the sets and props ready…” says Tim Bevan de Lange, Creative Director at Realtime Nordic, a studio that makes, specifically, video game trailers. “...and we haven’t actually shot anything, so you’ll need to do that yourself. Some of the actors won't come out of their trailers. One of them will but if you shoot him from the front you realise he's got no eyes, but don't show the audience that. It's not intentional, he's getting them fixed. Also can you film it twice, for different streaming platforms? Make a really good version for Netflix and a slightly worse looking one for Quibi.”\r\n\n\r\nEvery so often a game trailer comes along that makes me think, hang on, that was bloody brilliant! I bet some people made that! Most recently it was Creative Assembly’s Immortal Empires trailer. Well, I’ve been digging around and I’m happy to report that yes, although I’m the first one to just see a trailer as an algorithm trying to snatch my coin purse away like a manure-encrusted Victorian ne’er-do-well, game trailers are made by humans. They're often humans who do it as as specific job, either in-house at a developer or as an outside agency like Realtime Nordic. Enlightened and enthralled, I asked some of them about what went into the strange space that is making the trailers for your favourite games. \r\n\n \nRead more",

I mean, within the first minute of the game, your soldier goes from a terrified Normandy-style amphibious assault on a fortified metal church to seeing their war made irrelevant when the moon explodes.

Turns out her hunch was correct - Everywhere is a platform that allows players to create their own custom content. To show off what the tools can do, Benzies and the team unveiled MindsEye, an episodic “blockbuster” adventure available inside Everywhere. A game set inside a game, if you will.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It might be cruel to wrench these awards away so soon after receiving them, but it's all in the name of spreading good vibes and extra shoutouts, I promise.

We first came across Demonschool back at PAX West last year and have loved it ever since. It's a slick, tactical Persona-like where you play as a band of university students navigating school life by day and beating up ghosties and ghoulies by night.\nI had a chat with Demonschool's Jenna Stoeber who talked me through what Demonschool is about, the game's many horror inspirations, and what spooky shinanigans players can expect. If the giant skeleton lad in the game's trailer and demo is anything to go by, we're in for a treat. You can watch the full interview by watching the video below:\n\nIf you've haven't yet, set your peepers on Demonschool's slick trailer to see what demon hunter Faye and her gang of misfits are up against. There's no concrete release date, but like Jenna said, Demonschool should be out sometime in 2023 with a playable demo available in May.\nWe've got plenty more interviews, demos, and highlights lined up for the rest of the week and you can find all our PAX East coverage by checking out our RPS@PAX tag. \n \nRead more",

Whereas Relic's recently released Company Of Heroes 3 will let you pick from its four broad faction types in its WWII RTS battles, Men Of War 2 takes a much more granular view, offering up 14-15 different unit types for each of its three playable nations. That's a dizzying array of infantry, tank and artillery battalions to choose from, and that's before you account for all the individual nuances between its Soviet, USA and German army types. Throw in seven game modes across several different maps, and it's a veritable strategy smorgasbord to stuff your face into. \nCrucially, though, everyone gets access to some sort of tank, which let's face it, is always going to be the MVP of any WW2 strategy game, and probably the sole reason why we're here in the first place. As Men Of War 2 heads into its first open multiplayer tech test on Steam today (running until March 27th), here's my full report of my mildly doomed multiplayer tankventures in its Combat, Front Line and Incursion modes.\nRead more",

There are a lot of terrible things that call the oceans of The Marrows home in this melancholy fishing adventure, but what they are, I couldn't possibly tell you. In all my hours sailing these cursed waters, I've only ever seen brief flashes of them - their ungodly, slippery masses, long spiny fins, and a dozen different combinations of glowing eyes, teeth and tentacles. They're forever fading in and out of view, cloaked by the thick fog that blankets the sea every evening. Sometimes your ship lights will catch them for a split second before they slip away, or maybe you'll only hear them hurtling toward you, with a scream of a jet engine and a maw that's white hot, ready for gnashing your flimsy wooden carcass into sawdust. \nIt's unnerving, being out at sea after dark, but that's the time when the rarest and most vile catches raise their scaly heads. So the question becomes: are you willing to risk your own sanity for the sake of a quick buck? Or are you too afraid of what you'll find in Davy Jones' locker? In Dredge, the answer is always yes. Yes, you will be frightened of what's out there, whether it's real or born from your own fearful imaginings, but you'll sputter out into the darkness regardless, because the allure of this supernatural fishing sim is just too good to resist.\nRead more",

I remember a chill ran down my spine as I cast my mind back to Far Cry 6, where the tutorial island itself was longer than anything else I'd played that year. I was scared Redfall might succumb to a similar fate. I imagined it filling my head with map markers until my head swelled, popped like a balloon, and dropped grey rarity brain matter.\nWell, having given Redfall a go for 90 minutes I was, perhaps, being a bit dramatic. The game may be open world, and may have some slightly jarring open world-isms, but I felt like Arkane's magic wasn't diluted by it all. Their talent for storytelling and level design bubbled to the surface constantly, making exploration a genuine joy. Sure, I have some reservations, but I can't deny that I'm itching to play it again.\nRead more",

Lucky for us, that's not really what we're talking about here, although we do use that as a jumping-off point for our chat.\nInstead, we try to come up with an Indiescovery Manifesto, one that will guide us in the future when we're thinking about what games we ought to cover on the pod. We achieve this through a lively discussion that mainly involves me playing devil's advocate by throwing out ridiculous edge cases until Rachel and Liam want to break down and weep.

So last month, it was pretty big news to hear he was leaving Firaxis behind to chase a “new dream.” At the time, it was unclear what that dream was, but thanks to a podcast interview with My Perfect Console (spotted and transcribed by VGC) we now have an idea of what Solomon will do next. It involves opening a new studio and working on strategy games, unlike the ones he made at Firaxis.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Tchia’s island is a marvel to behold. Not only is it gorgeous, but it’s bursting with things to do: sailing, climbing, totem carving, gliding, pearl diving, sharpshooting, tree hopping, treasure hunting - the list goes on and on. \nNot only that, but there’s a 10-hour story to follow, quests to complete, and baddies to tussle with. It's a lot, but Awaceb seem to take it all in their stride. Never once does Tchia feel like it’s bursting at the seams; its balance of activities, exploration and story make it feel perfectly whole. The game's incredible scope doesn't feel like the debut of a nine-person team, but astonishingly, it is. We've had a good run of Bestest Bests on RPS this month, and I'm more than happy to extend it because Tchia is an absolute triumph.\nRead more",

It uses QLC flash in a DRAM-less design, but with HMB technology - so it uses your computer's RAM as its cache. That allows it to provide surprisingly excellent performance, although we'd still recommend a higher-end TLC drive with a DRAM cache for the most intensive workloads, like 4K video production.

No, I haven’t gone all Alan Moore and grimoired up a demonic pal to go gallivanting around the big Tescos with. That is next weekend. Instead, I’ve been playing Diablo 4’s beta, closed to all except an elite cadre of press, pre-orderers, and, uh, chicken enthusiasts. And so, axe in hand, I set forth, confident that whoever I found myself temporarily adventuring with would at least be fortified with adequate protein to wield rippling gains against the lords of hell.\r\n\n\r\nMouse-clicking connoisseurs of a certain age may remember a time when the name Blizzard was synonymous with the most gorgeously impressive CGI cutscenes your tiny mind had ever been blown by, and while Diablo 4’s lengthy introduction comes at a time where there’s far too much widespread talent for any one studio to claim that crown, it is still a goshdarn treat to take in. Not just technically, either. This chronicle of a cursed expedition is a mission statement for Diablo’s new (old) tone, and it sets the scene for things to come spectacularly - even if that tone straddles the line between gripping and noticeably self-concious about past accusations of cartooniness. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Layers Of Fear — recently quietly renamed from its working title Layers Of Fears — is a game that requires a bit of explanation. It shares its title with the 2016 game of the same name, and is being overseen by original developers Bloober Team. But it's neither a remake nor a reboot; although, in some ways, it's both of those things. It's more a \"reimagining\" of the whole Layers Of Fear series to date, as well as its apparent swansong. It incorporates ground-up remakes of the two-and-a-half existing games in the series in Unreal Engine 5, alongside a new gaiden chapter complementing the first game, and a brand-new framing narrative tying the whole lot together. \nI recently sat in on an early preview presentation of Layers Of Fear, chatting with creative director Damian Kocurek. Listeners to one very specific episode of the EWS podcast might recall that I'm something of a Layers Of Fear lore theorist, so of course I was delighted to nerd out over what this new(ish) game is all about. Similarly detail-oriented horror fans out there will hopefully share my excitement when I tell them that yes, the rats are back, and you can even catch a brief glimpse of the Rat Queen.\nRead more",

          "description": "In the run-up to its original 2005 release, Capcom was refreshingly - and publicly - clear about their intentions for Resident Evil 4. Feeling that the classic fixed-camera formula that had seen the series thrive during the 90s had grown stale, this follow-up was to be a total reinvention of survival horror as a concept. Something fresh. Dynamic. Exciting. The slate was wiped completely clean, and from that blank canvas, something exceptional was created. A game that not only redefined the franchise, but third-person action games as a whole.\nFor eighteen tumultuous years, Capcom has tried to surpass the success of Resident Evil 4. The fifth and sixth entries doubled down on the action to mixed results, while seven and eight focused on scares as seen from a first-person viewpoint. Meanwhile, 2019’s Resident Evil 2 remake looked to the past for its inspiration, delivering a masterful retread that blended responsive third-person combat with the exquisite production values of the series’ more modern titles. But with the release of Resident Evil 4 remake, Resident Evil has finally come full circle. Whereas the original release was a rejection of the games that came before, this remake is instead a celebration of where the series went next. Action-focused combat. Photo-realistic environments. Gooey monsters, hammy characters, ridiculous storylines. What better way to remake the highest peak of the series, than to build it upon the foundations of the very games it went on to inspire? Resident Evil 4 is a rambunctious thrill ride that is as good - if not, dare I say it, a bit better - than the original game.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Dodgy reseller listings aside, the Steam Deck has spent its entire life thus far without even a temporary price drop. That ends today, as the Steam Spring Sale has launched with the first official Steam Deck savings - a 10% cut across the range - alongside the more expected dealsplosion of discounted games.\nWhat’s more, this sale could also be the last time that the Steam Deck joins in a Steam sale, at least for a very long time. Lawrence Yang, a Valve designer who recently spoke to us about the Deck’s first year in the wild, has also told me that the company are \"looking at this as a one-time deal in celebration of Steam Deck's anniversary.\" You’ll therefore have until March 23rd, when the Spring Sale ends, to seize a saving on the handheld PC before it returns to base pricing – maybe for good.\nAll three Steam Deck versions are part of the sale, shedding exactly 10% apiece. The 64GB model is down from £349 / $399 to £314.10 / $359.10, the 256GB model drops from £459 / $529 to £413.10 / $476.10, and the top 512GB model falls from £569 / $649 to £512.10 / $584.10. Unlike the sad old days of 2022, there’s no lengthy waiting period once you put your order in, though I wouldn’t be surprised if it takes the full two weeks of Valve’s one-to-two week delivery estimate, what with the likely surge in demand.\n Read more",

The first time I met up with Kelvin and we got to work, casually making our shitty shelter and stick storage, I perused the guidebook to see what’s next, and I spotted a planter. A planter?

          "description": "The latest Steam Deck client update has added Valve’s local network game transfers feature – previously only available in beta form – to the Stable branch, marking a full launch for one of the most useful Steam Deck feature upgrades in months.\r\n\n\r\nIf you missed the local transfers beta release last month, know that the name is quite literal: it lets you transfer Steam game installs between your PC and your Steam Deck over a local network, rather than having to re-download them onto every device you own. It also works when transferring between a Steam Deck and another Steam Deck, or between two PCs. Valve have a little explainer here, but it’s simple enough that – for example – hitting the Install button for a game on your Steam Deck will automatically detect if your PC is on the same network, and start transferring as much as it can from the desktop instead of downloading the whole thing from scratch.\r\n\n\r\nYou can even opt into sending/receiving game data from PCs and Steam Decks owned by other people, so long as they’re also connected to the same local network. The biggest benefit seemingly comes to those with monthly data caps (morning, Yanks), as these transfers won’t usually involve any extra downloads. Even so, it’s a helpful addition for anyone on all-you-can-eat data as well, since local transfers are much faster than old fashioned installs. \r\n \nRead more",

Its twists and turns from the get-go have my brain doing mental gymnastics, not just in the game but in trying to figure out how to write around them for this review. I’m not going to spoil everything, but keeping your expectations completley wide open lets Paranormasight snake right on in and surprise you when you least expect it to. \nHere’s a quick elevator pitch: Paranormasight is a Squeenix-developed horror mystery visual novel about deadly rituals, ghost stories, curses, and the occult. Its subversive approach to classic visual novel staples make its puzzles feel smart and its horror scares hit hard. If you’re a fan of the thrills found in the Danganronpa and Zero Escape games, Paranormasight is like a bite-sized version of those two behemoths. It’s short, smart, and will keep you on your toes until the end.\nSo yeah, if that sounds like your thing, then have at it. From here on in, I'm going to be gabbing abut it in-depth.\nRead more",

It was cute and intriguing, and best of all it was coming from Turnfollow, the devs behind Little Party and Wide Ocean Big Jacket - two small, but awesome, story-centric indies. A mere week after being announced Before The Green Moon snuck past us and launched into full release. Just yesterday, in fact.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "I know you all like Hardspace: Shipbreaker, and I get that on paper it is very much my type of game. It is a manual job (slicing up spaceships for salvage) with an extra layer (unionism) to elevate it far beyond what it could have gotten away with. In this way it seems a lot like my beloved PowerWash Simulator (washing things; time travel).\nThe main thrust of the game I can really get behind - peeling apart big metal ships like clanky onions - but the more literal thrust, i.e. the moving around in zero gravity using a jetpack, is awful. I need you to give me a frame of reference for if you all felt this way at the start, because, genuinely, I am so bad at Hardspace: Shipbreaker that it makes me want to cry.\nRead more",

Because yes, instead of bopping along to its excellent, punchy rhythm action combat and, you know, actually playing the damn thing, I've spent most of my early hours with Hi-Fi Rush fiddling about with image sliders and lining up Chai and best video game cat bot 808 into daft, stupid poses for the sake of a good screenshot.

Ah, achievements. Never mind if they're good or bad. Today, we're remembering the terrible things we've done to actually get them.\nThe question comes courtesy of Fachewachewa, who asked: What's the worst thing you've done for an achievement? Or more generally, a time you were focused on a specific goal in a game, reached it (or gave up), and after, looked back and thought, \"Why did I do that?\" \nWhy, indeed. Come and find out which achievements have spawned our biggest gaming regrets, and why not tell us about your own gaming follies in the comments?

          "description": "Perfect Blue Velvet\nAs part of yesterday's Future Games Show presentation, Shiro Unlimited released a new trailer for its gooey psychological horror title Decarnation — In addition, the publisher announced that the title will launch on PC and Nintendo Switch at some point this coming May.\nDescribed as an \"intensely emotional story unfolding in a malignant, elaborate setting\", Decarnation uses lo-fi visuals to tell the tale of a Parisian cabaret dancer, Gloria, who is struggling to find her big break, held back by a litany of problems related to her life and career. When a seemingly can't-miss opportunity comes her way, Gloria finally realizes that this could be her chance to pull the fraying ends of her life together. But the human mind does not always allow for the best-laid plans, and Gloria's spiraling emotions may be about to manifest themselves very real-world nightmares.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmeL6rfuJS8&ab_channel=ShiroGames%7CUnlimited\nDecarnation will blend dramatic role-playing elements with puzzle action and elements of survival to create a uniquely creepy, brain-bending experience. With clear stylistic influences coming from the works of directors such as Satoshi Kon and David Lynch, as well as the familiar trappings of the giallo genre, Decarnation doesn't look like it will be standard \"OMG Zombies!\" horror title — instead reaching a little deeper into the darkness of the human soul, as it twists and bends to deal with the realities of the living, and unloving world.\nI'm keeping several eyes on this... including the ones growing out of my arms.\nDecarnation launches this May on Nintendo Switch and PC (via Steam).\nThe post Atelier horror title Decarnation looks like a Lynchian nightmare appeared first on Destructoid.",

This number represents the highest amount of Steam user concurrently playing any Resident Evil release at any one time, including previous remakes Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3, as well as modern mainline sequels Resident Evil VII: Biohazard and Resident Evil Village.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj9UeZzp12o&ab_channel=ResidentEvil\nClearly, the nostalgia factor of the original Resident Evil 4 — still considered a series highlight some 18 years on from its initial GameCube release — will help drive the new 2023 edition to incredible success. The launch of the highly anticipated title is set to kick off what is expected to be a stellar year for Capcom, with dinosaur hunter Exoprimal and the stellar-looking Street Fighter 6 waiting in the wings for the coming quarters. The publisher will no doubt be quick to let us all know how RE4's week one sales work out, as players don the sheepskin coat of Leon S.

          "description": "You DO know Jack\nYou know the name, and you could've predicted the number — Bandai Namco has released another character trailer for its great-looking fighter Tekken 8, this time focusing on the return of one of the franchise's longest-\"living\" characters: the destructive battle droid, Jack-8.\nJack, as Tekken fans will be fully aware, is essentially the name of numerous characters in the Tekken series, essentially depicted as newly upgraded versions of the original Mishima Zaibatsu robo-soldier. While each successive game has seen Jack's visual style and overall sense of technical reliability improve, the character has consistently been a heavy power hitter, taking down his opponents with huge, clubbing blows and an increasingly ridiculous range of weaponry and firepower. Let's take a look at Jack-8.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1b4MyA6wPJI&ab_channel=BandaiNamcoEntertainmentAmerica\nFrom this first glance, Tekken 8's Jack-8 model looks incredibly — dare I say — \"Cyber\", somehow sporting a more futuristic design while still being oddly archaic in design. Still, despite his new look, our favorite metal man is still more than capable of flattening the opposition with the aforementioned haymakers and axhandles — given an extra boost in the form of explosive detonations on impact. To call it a day, Jack-8 calls in a ridiculously oversized energy cannon, wiping out the enemy, (and almost himself), with a devastating beam of raw power, not dissimilar to Iron Man's Proton Cannon from Marvel vs. Capcom.\nTekken 8 is currently in development for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X. It is tentatively expected to launch in 2023. Be sure to check out the previous trailers for Jin Kazama, Kazuya Mishima, Nina Williams, King, Paul Phoenix, and Lars Alexandersson. We only need see the returning Jun Kazama and the opening salvo of the sequel's roster is complete.\nThe post Jack-8, the ‘High Tech Annihilator’, dominates in Tekken 8 trailer appeared first on Destructoid.",

Set between the events of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, the game will see Gollum embark upon his own odyssey across Middle-Earth, meeting tentative allies and bitter enemies in his pursuit of the core of his being... \"The Precious\".\nYou can check out a new, lengthy gameplay showcase video below.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOBqFV6EO80&ab_channel=Nacon\nDeveloped by Daedalic, this ambitious project has seen several setbacks since its initial reveal way back in the spring of 2019, but is finally on the road to fruition.

QTE events caught on in a big way, and set-piece moments became focal points in many big titles. Some of the best and worst parts of modern game design were first popularized in the 2005 title. As meandering and unfocused as it could be, it's an important and well-loved title.\nWhen the Resident Evil 4 remake was announced, like many people, I wondered how Capcom would approach the most over-the-top and ridiculous elements that seem so out-of-place in the drab, monotonous high-budget market.

The plussed-up Plus will also add new modes, animations, music, and other aesthetic options.\nHere's the full description from Sega:\n\"Sonic Origins Plus will be available as an all-in-one bundle that includes the Sonic Origins base game and the Plus Expansion Pack, featuring 12 Sonic Game Gear titles, playable Knuckles in Sonic CD, and for the first time ever: Amy Rose as a playable cha…",

M2 has been in the porting business since 1993’s Gauntlet IV for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive. Since then it has grown to be one of the most respected developers for porting games to new hardware.\nRainmaker Productions approached M2 to port Assault Suit Valken to modern consoles with the purpose of providing a version that was re-translated and uncensored.

Hailing from South Korea, Kim utilizes his incredible martial arts abilities to better the world, bestowing a sense of honor into all he meets and ensuring justice is seen to be done for those who have strayed from a path of enlightenment. Kim's role in KoF famously saw his endless efforts to rehabilitate criminals Choi Bounge and Chang Koehan. Despite his boy scout nature, Kim is a respected character among the SNK community.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO_GppPzlig&ab_channel=SNKOFFICIAL\nAs the above trailer demonstrates, Kim is bringing his iconic and acrobatic range of kicks to the King of Fighters XV party, including his range of devastating flying axe kicks, his gravity-defying headstomps, and his incredible, lightning-speed Supers. Sadly, Kim's iconic pants aren't quite as billowy as they were in his 2D days, but anybody picking up Kim as DLC will at least receive his classic costume as a bonus skin. Kim Kaphwan will be available this spring, with further characters expected later in 2023.\nThe King of Fighters XV is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox Series X.\nThe post King of Fighters XV trailer spotlights bringer of JUSTICE, Kim Kaphwan appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Almost Unreal\nAs part of this week's Game Developer Conference (GDC) publisher Epic Games and developer Team Ninja has shone the light on the stunning facial animation tech that will be used to bring life and personality to the characters of long-in-development sequel Senua's Saga: Hellblade II.\nThe demonstration video shows off Unreal Engine's \"Metahuman\" technology, and features the face of actor Melina Juergens, who portrays the troubled Senua in the Hellblade series. The video begins with an extreme close-up of Senua's eyes, slowing pulling back as she delivers a dramatic monologue, before finally being lost in flickering flame. While the blending of reality and digital effects will almost always contain some element of the infamous \"Uncanny Valley\", it can't be denied that the technology is mightily impressive.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1qG8pREfkA&embeds_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.polygon.com%2F&source_ve_path=MjM4NTE&feature=emb_title&ab_channel=NinjaTheory\n\"This cloud-hosted tool allows you to create photorealistic digital humans for your game or experience, with the simplicity of an RPG character creator, yet with a level of realism and customization that you’ve never seen before,\" says Epic Games' chief technology officer Kim Librerim.\nSenua's Saga: Hellblade II was first announced back in 2019, with only scant updates and previews offered on the grim-looking sequel. Given Hellblade II's core approach to psychological horror and deep, emotive characters, the Metahuman tech will allow the developers to best capture Juergens as she delivers what is expected to be another stellar lead performance. Should it be a success, we can likely expect to see other character-focused adventures experiment with the next-gen tech.\nSenua's Saga: Hellblade II is currently in development for PC and Xbox Series X.\nThe post Ninja Theory shows off Hellblade II’s stunning facial animation tech appeared first on Destructoid.",

While we reviewed The Isle Dragon Roars over a year ago, two more entries have released since then. As of this morning (thanks John!) a bundle has appeared on the Nintendo Switch eShop, which collects all three of them in one neat digital package.\nThe package is $49.99, and includes all three games. Described as a \"quirky series of RPGs where the whole world is depicted through the medium of cards\" (which is fairly apt!), this subseries has been gaining some traction in select communities, with the power of Square Enix-backed art behind it. Let's dig into what this bundle actually entails.\nDoes the Voice of Cards trilogy bundle save you any money or include the DLC?\nLet's take a look at what the current prices are on the eShop if you bought each Voice of Cards game piecemeal, compared to the $49.99 bundle:\nThe Isle Dragon Roars - $29.99\nThe Forsaken Maiden - $29.99\nBeasts of Burden - $29.99\nSo uh, you could say it saves you quite a bit! Of course there is DLC afoot for the series (it is Square Enix), but you're getting all three core games with the bundle.\nAbout that: there is another Trilogy + DLC set bundle for $64.99 if you want to go all-in. Here's what the DLC entails, straight from Square Enix: \"the designs of in-game items such as cards, playing pieces and tables to be styled after the games from the NieR series, DLC that changes the game music and DLC that changes the visuals for all characters and enemies to a pixel art style.\"\nVoice of Cards is also present on PS4, PC, and mobile devices, if you don't want to dump all the cash required on the Switch bundle.\nThe post If you’re interested in Voice of Cards, the trilogy just appeared on the Switch eShop appeared first on Destructoid.",

Aside from being about mecha, the two games seemed to have different approaches to design.

There was an odd sense of realism to its fantastic sci-fi themes.\nHowever, its release as Cybernator by Konami on the SNES was somewhat compromised.

          "description": "Diving for Atari gold\nAtari has announced that it has entered into an agreement to purchase retro restoration developer Nightdive Studios. The chairman of Atari reportedly already owned a 13% minority stake in Nightdive, and the deal is for Atari to buy up 100% of the shares.\nNightdive Studios has long been a well-regarded developer of ports of older PC titles. Some of these endeavors have resulted in full source ports, as was the case in the move of Power Slave to their proprietary KEX Engine. Currently, Nightdive is working on a complete refurbishment of System Shock, which is slated for release May 30.\nFor Atari’s part, it has largely been pushing modernized versions of its legacy library with games like Yars: Recharged, which I haven’t played, but I can’t imagine it being much worse than 2011’s Yars Revenge reimagining. The company has been pretty shaky for years, though their reproduction of Atari games on authentic cartridges shows some respect for their properties, and the recent team-up with Digital Eclipse on the Atari 50 collection has yielded one of the best retro compilations in years. Maybe they’re turning a new leaf, and Nightdive will help steer them on a good path. Who knows?\nI’m trying to be optimistic. I have a lot of respect for Nightdive and not much for Atari. It’s like seeing your sibling hook up with the guy who’s best known for pooping himself in gym class. I’m trying to be optimistic. Maybe Atari’s pooping days are behind them. I guess we’ll have to wait and see.\nI reached out to Larry Kuperman, Director of Business Development at Nightdive Studios. He commented, \"A major factor in choosing to partner with Atari is that Nightdive will be able to continue our mission to bring back lost classics, but with greater resources available.\"\nThe post Atari enters agreement to purchase Nightdive Studios appeared first on Destructoid.",

We had quite a few big releases, but some of them were only released in 2022 because they were delayed (in several cases, repeatedly). Some projects were even delayed out of 2022. That's what makes this newest annual ranking list from Metacritic so interesting.\nGoing solely off of critical rankings (with a formula detailed below), Metacritic managed to muster up a full \"top 45\" list based on 2022 releases: and Sony took the top spot. They're followed by Paradox Interactive (who released a string of critically-well-received-and-sometimes-niche-games), and surprisingly, Activision Blizzard: who is currently riding high off of the mostly positive reception for the Diablo IV beta.\nMixed into the…",

          "description": "Update 112 involves IGA (Koji Igarashi) streams\nBloodstained: Ritual of the Night launched its Kickstarter in 2015, and not all of its campaign promises have been delivered yet. Now that comes with the territory for some Kickstarters, but it's absolutely wild to see that I'm still getting original project Bloodstained Kickstarter updates in 2023. This week, backers just got their 112th update.\nIt's not info on anything coming up for the game update-wise, though. Rather, it's a tease for a \"promise from eight years ago,\" where Bloodstained boss IGA will have dinner and stream with \"IGAventure reward tier\" backers.\nHere's the full context of the most recent update:\n\"The time to fulfill the promise from eight years ago has finally come! I will be having dinner and streaming with the backers who backed the IGAventure reward tier. The game streaming will take place on our YouTube channel at JPN time 13:00-14:00 on Friday, March 24. (That's 4 AM UTC, or 9 PM Pacific on March 23.) We will be playing Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, as we can start playing right away. It would be a short amount of time, but please come watch.\"\n\nWhat's left for Bloodstained to deliver?\nWell, beyond some folks who say they're still waiting for physical copies, there's also some more content on the way. Back in June of 2022 an update from the Bloodstained team noted that they were getting \"closer to the completion of development,\" which involves more free DLC. There's a crossover for the Journey franchise, as well as Chaos and VS modes (which includes online co-op and PVP), more outfits for main character Miriam, and Classic 2 (a \"new premium mode\").\nHere's the latest info we have on everything beyond the Journey crossover: \"We have not finalized the release timeframes for the new outfits and Classic Mode 2. They may be released separately, together or grouped with Chaos and Vs Modes. We will make that decision later.\"\nThe post Getting Kickstarter updates for Bloodstained in 2023 is wild y’all appeared first on Destructoid.",

Developer FromSoftware notes that resolution and frame rate may be impacted by switching on the shiny technology. Of course, those Tarnished with a very meaty PC rig will likely be able to ramp up the juice, bringing Elden Ring's visuals to life like never before.\nIn addition to the Ray Tracing update, Version 1.09 includes a fistful of bug stomps, as well as a litany of rebalance tweaks to Elden Ring's PvP and Ashes of War features, as well as general tweaks across the game's weaponry and spells. For full details on these changes to Elden Ring, as well as the recommended specs for Ray Tracing users, be sure to check out the official patch notes over on the Bandai Namco website.\nElden Ring is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

          "description": "Microsoft purchase changed platform plans\nDeveloper Arkane Austin has confirmed that its incoming monster-masher Redfall was initially planned as a multi-platform title, but was asked to drop the PS5 edition once Microsoft acquired the studio in the ZeniMax Media purchase — which took place back in the summer of 2020.\nThe somewhat unsurprising revelation was made by studio director Harvey Smith in an interview with IGN France. Smith describes the Microsoft purchase as \"Change with a capital C\", noting any plans for a Playstation edition of the vampire-hunting multiplayer title were instantly scrapped by the new owners. \"They came in and they said 'No PlayStation 5. We're focusing on Xbox, PC, and Game Pass.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR8GVePOdpY&ab_channel=BethesdaSoftworks\nSmith notes that he thinks it was a good idea, with the dropping of Redfall on PS5 allowing the studio to focus on one less platform and add further polish to the project. Smith also points to Xbox Game Pass' 30 million subscribers as a solid install base for the multiplayer-focused shooter, which will hopefully provide Redfall with a ready-made community of players. A Monster Squad, of sorts.\nIt should be noted that Microsoft is currently bitterly embroiled in legal battles over its proposed purchase of Activision Blizzard, the main concern by opponents being the possibility that Microsoft might make some of Activision's biggest franchises — such as Call of Duty — Xbox exclusive brands. Microsoft has denied any intent of this motion, though publishers such as PlayStation will no doubt use this Redfall revelation as an example of what \"could happen\", strong evidence to present to any judges unaware of the realities of the industry.\nRedfall launches May 2 on Xbox Series X, PC, and Xbox Game Pass.\nThe post Redfall was in development for PS5 before Microsoft/ZeniMax purchase appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "A video game based on the hit Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles graphic novel The Last Ronin is in the works, Polygon reports.\nThe news comes from Polygon's interview with Doug Rosen, senior vice president for games and emerging media at Paramount Global. According to Rosen, The Last Ronin video game will be a single-player action role-playing title in the vein of the Norse-themed God of War series. Like the story it adapts, the game will feature a mature tone. The game’s developer has not been named, and the project is years away from release. \nThe Last Ronin was published in 2020 as a five-issue mini-series by IDW. It takes place in a dark futuristic New York, where three of the four turtles have been killed. The surviving turtle, whose identity is revealed at the end of the first issue (we won’t spoil it), dons a black mask and seeks revenge by fighting crime using both his and the weapons of his fallen brothers. \nIt’s a cool (and very grim) story if you haven’t read it, and we’re excited to see it translated into a game. Rosen also mentions in the same interview that Paramount sees opportunities to create different types of TMNT games that target young and adult audiences. \nThe Turtles are enjoying quite the renaissance lately thanks to the launch of the well-received beat ‘em up Shredder’s Revenge last year, the nostalgia trip of the Cowabunga Collection, a Shredder-themed Call of Duty pack, and even a new animated film coming to theaters this August.  \n[Source: Polygon]",

Today, Sega announced the bundle is about to get better through Sonic Origins Plus, a premium upgrade that arrives a year after the collection's initial launch.\nSonic Origins Plus brings forward all the features of Sonic Origins delivered last year – Classic Mode, Anniversary Mode, widescreen support, added story animations, a virtual museum, and more – while adding a bunch of new content. First up, Sonic Origins Plus adds all 12 Sonic Game Gear games to the museum.\nThe full list of Game Gear games getting added is listed below.\nDr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine\nSonic Blast\nSonic Chaos\nSonic Drift\nSonic Drift 2\nSonic Labyrinth\nSonic Spinball\nSonic the Hedgehog\nSonic the Hedgehog 2\nSonic the Hedgehog Triple Trouble\nTails Adventure\nTails' Sky Patrol\nOn top of that, Amy joins the roster of playable characters in the Genesis and Sega CD titles (Sonic 1, Sonic 2, Sonic 3 & Knuckles, and Sonic CD). One of the strangest exclusions in the original Sonic Origins release is also rectified, as Knuckles will become playable in Sonic CD. Sadly, this first press release does not make any mention of restoring the replaced music in Sonic the Hedgehog 3.\n\n\nSonic Origins Plus arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on June 23. If you don't already own the initial release of Sonic Origins, the digital version of Sonic Origins Plus costs $40.

          "description": "Arkane was developing a PlayStation 5 version of its upcoming first-person vampire shooter, Redfall, before Microsoft acquired Bethesda in 2020. However, following the acquisition, the PS5 version of the game was canceled by Microsoft, according to Arkane director Harvey Smith in an interview with IGN France (translated by IGN). \nDiscussing this with IGN France, Smith said, \"We got bought by Microsoft and that was a huge sea change. They said, 'No PlayStation 5. Now we're gonna do Game Pass, Xbox and PC.'\"\n\n\nSmith said Arkane didn't mind the decision, even if Redfall was originally meant to release on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. \n\"Support from Game Pass and having to worry about one less platform, one less complexity,\" Smith told IGN France. \"And Game Pass has a ton of people that can play. It could be our biggest game ever because of the 30 million Game Pass [members] or whatever that number is.\" \nNews of this canceled PS5 version of Redfall doesn't come as much of a surprise. When Redfall was revealed during a 2021 Xbox and Bethesda E3 showcase, it was revealed as an Xbox console exclusive. And considering it's par for the course for companies like PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo to keep their first-party releases off of competitor consoles, it's also not surprising Microsoft opted to make Redfall an Xbox exclusive after it acquired Bethesda. \nA spokesperson for Microsoft responded to this story, providing the following statement: \nRedfall hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC on May 2. \nFor more about the game, watch the latest Redfall story trailer that introduces some of the vampiric big bass and then watch this gameplay trailer that invites you out to a bloody night on the town. \n[Source: IGN France via IGN]\nAre you excited for Redfall?

This beta will feature Crash Bandicoot, Coco Bandicoot, Tawna Bandicoot, Doctor Neo Cortex, and Dingodile. \n\n\nThe game will cost $29.99 but a deluxe edition for $39.99 will also be available. Crash Team Rumble will also include a battle pass and both editions include the first season's pass. The deluxe edition will also include the Season 2 battle pass, a free 25-tier boost for Season 1, and the digital proto pack, which brings \"Blocky\" skins to the game alongside some equippable items, according to VGC. \nPreviews released today mention three different roles in Crash Team Rumble: Booster, Blocker, and Scorer. Using these three roles in a MOBA-like fashion, players will need to collect as much Wumpa Fruit as possible and bring it to their zone. If you've played 2021's Pokemon Unite, you probably get the gist here. \n\nCrash Team Rumble will feature crossplay. It is being developed by Toys for Bob, the team that developed the Crash Bandicoot N.

As for the type of game, Snyder says it will be an RPG and apparently, it will have a \"ridiculous scale.\" \n\"The one thing that I'm having a really good time with – and I don't really know if I'm supposed to talk about it – is this RPG that we're doing that is just literally insane, and so immersive and so intense and so huge,\" he said on the podcast, according to VGC. \"There's more coming, but all I'll say is that it was pitched to me – because I've always wanted to do an RPG – like, 'well, we could do it at this scale, or we could do it at ridiculous scale.'\n\"And I was like, 'ridiculous scale is clearly the scale that we should be doing it.'\"\nSnyder says the team behind the RPG said, \"Well, it's going to take so much time, we've got to do all these brain dumps, you've got to tell us everything in the universe, what's happening, the science.\" And Snyder said he was happy to do that, telling them, \"Let's go all the way.\" \nSnyder wrote and directed Rebel Moon and it hits Netflix this December. \nIn the meantime, read about how Netflix is developing its own series based on video games, like this live-action Assassin's Creed show and this animated Gears of Wars series (alongside a live-action Gears of War film, too). \n[Source: The Nerd Queens via Video Games Chronicle]\nAre you interested in playing a Rebel Moon RPG?

          "description": "Last November, Game Freak released Pokémon Scarlet and Violet on Switch. The game quickly became one of the top-selling games in the history of the popular console, and now, it's time for the new generation to kick off within the popular Pokémon Trading Card Game. The inaugural Pokémon Scarlet & Violet expansion does more than just introduce the ninth generation of Pokémon into the TCG; it also implements a whole host of changes, not the least of which is a higher price tag for most items. \nHowever, along with that price increase come several benefits, including a new guarantee of three foil cards in every booster pack, plus the introduction of the silver border in the U.S. and other quality-of-life improvements with regards to the designs. The Pokémon Company sent over several booster packs for us to crack open and see what we could pull. While I was less frequently blown away by the big cards I pulled, this is one of the most robust galleries of \"the coolest cards\" articles I've done in a great many expansions. Partially, that is due to me enjoying seeing some of the newer Pokémon from Gen IX getting their first cards, but I can't help but think the increase in foil cards was to thank.\nIn total, the Pokémon Scarlet & Violet expansion introduces more than 190 new cards, including more than 10 new Pokémon ex cards, more than 30 Trainer cards, new Tera Pokémon, and tons of special-illustration Pokémon and Trainer cards. You can see the coolest cards we pulled from this expansion in the gallery below:\n\n Pokémon Trading Card Game: Scarlet & Violet is available starting on March 31.

Following its arcade release, Berzerk was ported to the Atari 2600 and Atari 5200 by the console maker. Frenzy is actually a sequel to Berzerk first released in 1982. \n\"Berzerk is one of those foundational games that so many people first encountered playing on an Atari console,\" Atari CEO Wade Rosen writes in the press release. \"Berzerk, and the other titles included in this acquisition, are a perfect fit for our strategy of commercializing classic retro IP.\"\nWho knows if we'll learn what the other 10 retro arcade properties Atari has acquired are – only time will tell.

          "description": "This year our project was accepted to the Google Summer of Code program for the eighth year in a row (and 16th time in total).\nThe intention of the program is to bring new contributors to open source projects, and the eligibility rules for participants are the same as last year, with both students and non-students welcome to participate. Check the  Google Summer of Code website for details of eligibility.\nParticipants can apply for either short tasks (about 175 hours) or long tasks (about 350 hours). The coding period typically runs from the start of June to the end of August, but there is some flexibility and the participants can opt to use a longer coding period if they are not available to work full time on the project during the summer.\nScummVM is looking for applicants! A list of suggested projects can be found on this page, but we’re open to your own ideas too. Please make sure you provide the required information in your application before submitting. We also strongly encourage you to join our Discord server and follow the #scummvm-gsoc channel where you can engage with our mentors and the rest of the team, and get advice and help on getting started with the project and writing your application.\nWe have gathered some information to guide you, based on our previous 15 years of experience in the program. You may start your exploration from our Google Summer of Code miniportal.\nWe are looking forward to your application and participation!\n>",
