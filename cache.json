If you applied for the CNT and got selected, you'll be able to experience everything I'm about to tell you for yourself starting this Friday, November 12th, until Monday November 15th. But even though my hands-on with Elden Ring was brief, I’m confident that this is Souls taking a step in the right direction. It’s at once new and familiar, but forever exciting.

          "description": "Lost Ark is a free-to-play action RPG-inspired MMO that came out to great acclaim in Korea back in 2018. Now, Amazon Games are bringing its flashy, Diablo-like combat to the west in the form of a closed beta later today, and we've had an early sneak peek at it. Of course, what with Amazon's own MMO New World now settling into its third month, not to mention Final Fantasy 14's Endwalker expansion looming on the horizon, Lost Ark arrives at a busy time for fervent EXP grinders. The big question, then, is whether Lost Ark’s Diablo-y formula can do enough to compete with the already well-established MMO juggernauts. Judging by my few hours of hands-on time, I’m thinking it might, but only if you’re able to embrace its slow burn.\nRead more",

Led by this, the Intel Core i9-12900K, Alder Lake sees the adoption of a hybrid architecture that combines high-power Performance cores (P-cores) with Efficiency cores (E-cores) that can free up headroom by taking on background tasks. The Core i9-12900K takes this opportunity to bulk up, combining eight P-cores and E-cores apiece for a total of 16 cores and 24 threads.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Ever since AMD’s Ryzen chips appeared with an alluring balance of gaming speed, desktop multitasking performance, efficiency, and affordability, Intel seemed to sink into a comfort zone of simply raising clock speeds and maybe adding a few cores. \r\n\n\r\nThis was often enough to earn some half-throated recommendations for gaming builds specifically, but this past year proved that something needed to change, with the AMD Ryzen 5 5600X claiming the best gaming CPU title and 11th Gen Rocket Lake Intel chips – like the 5600X’s rival Core i5-11600K – looking thoroughly skippable. For those who did decide to wait until the 12th Gen Alder Lake launch, consider yourselves vindicated, as the Core i5-12600K is a great all-rounder: both a Ryzen-beater in games and, thanks to a long-overdue architecture revamp, a drastically better general purpose processor.\r\n\n \nRead more",

And, hey, like, we get it, y’know, we all like to “hang loose” on Tik Tok sometimes, but – at this point Gareth the 43-year-old divorcé grabs a chair, spins it 180 degrees and sits on it in one smooth motion – dope just isn’t on fleek, fam.\nInsufferable cutscenes aside, this is a thrilling downhill racing simulator in which you, a new arrival to a vast landscape of snowy peaks, scorched desert badlands, towering forests and rain-lashed mud flats, must repeatedly hurl yourself down the side of a mountain faster or more stylishly than your opponents. The world is a compressed version of California with all of the San Franciscos taken out, leaving just a bizarre population of baggy jeans wearing Urban Dictionary acolytes, and a vast interconnected series of freely roamable tracks and wilderness littered with activities to complete and landmarks to discover.\nRead more",

          "description": "When I first heard about it, I didn't think Unpacking would appeal to me. Released today, it's a chill game about unpacking moving boxes, unloading all the items from someone's life into their new home. I've never liked unpacking in real life, it feels stressful and annoying trying to find space for all my stuff. But I'm starting to think that Unpacking (the game) might make me feel better about it. Perhaps next time I move house, I should go into it with the energy of this relaxed puzzler. \r\n\n \nRead more",

But the question was, would it be an inspired homage to the Upside Down, or a cash grab with a voxel paint job designed to lure in 'the youth'? The answer, sadly, is neither.\nRead more",

Is it a grim sign of ravenous consumerism, or a welcome respite from the watching the year die slowly and painfully in its final months? As I untangled my strings of LED lights this morning, I realised that PC gaming is the most Christmassy of gamings. The colourful LEDs people cram into their PC's every orifice and pore aren't just any decoration, they're Christmas lights. That's their purpose. It always has been.

Image & Form Games went quiet with The Gunk for about a year before it stepped back into the spotlight (and out of the gunk) during the Xbox Gamescom 2021 stream held in August. There, it was revealed that the Xbox-exclusive title would be released this December. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nNow, we know it’s releasing December 16 thanks to a new blog post from the team. \n“We’re so excited to finally reveal the release date of The Gunk, our highly anticipated Xbox exclusive from the creators of the SteamWorld franchise,” the post reads. “Get stuck into The Gunk on December 16 – for anyone subscribed to Game Pass, it’s launching day and date on the service.” \nAs noted above, The Gunk will be available on launch day for Xbox Game Pass subscribers. When players jump into it, they’ll experience what the Image & Form Games team describes as a “third-person action adventure game about a duo of gritty space haulers, Rani and Becks, struggling to make a buck as they chance upon a mysterious planet laden with a wealth of natural resources.” It’s on that planet that they discover what’s known as the gunk, which is damaging the planet – however, said gunk is worth a lot of money and the duo must determine what’s more important to them.  \nWhile waiting for The Gunk to be released next month, read about this other Image & Form Games title, SteamWorld Headhunter, which was just announced during the Thuderful Games showcase. \nAre you excited for The Gunk? Let us know in the comments below!",

Capping off the presentation was a brief look at the next chapter in the SteamWorld franchise, SteamWorld Headhunter.\nThe teaser (which you can watch below) features two robotic cowboys featuring spectacular 'staches facing off in a familiar pistol dueling position. You know, desert town, high noon, and all of that. One automaton looks to have lost the shootout, and in the process, lost his head. When the victor checks on the deceased's condition, only to find its head is detached and flying at him with deadly intent. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nThunderful isn't saying much about Headhunter other than it's a direct follow-up to \"the (literally) earth-shattering events of SteamWorld Dig 2\" and will be a full 3D, co-op action adventure experience.

          "description": "Nothing can escape the gravitational pull of February 2022. Not even Valve and its upcoming handheld Steam Deck. The company has announced the initial wave of devices that were supposed to ship out in December will now have a targeted February ship date.\nThe delay is due to the global supply chain issues plaguing many businesses heading into the holiday season. Here's Valve's announcement of the shifted timeline and its reasoning why in full:\nIt looks like Steam Deck reservations that were due later will also be affected. Keep an eye on your Steam account if you've pre-ordered one already.\nWhile it's disappointing to have to wait the extra couple of months, two months isn't a lot longer to wait. Hopefully, this will give Valve the time needed to gather the proper components and ship these bad boys out to the gaming public. \nThe Steam Deck was announced in July promising a device capable of bringing your entire Steam library on the go in a compact Switch-like form factor. You can read about the device from our story on the announcement, and you can check out our suggestions on the best games to play on Steam Deck here.",

          "description": "Spider-Man swings exclusively into the PlayStation versions of Marvel’s Avengers on November 30. Developer Crystal Dynamics finally gave us our first look at the wall-crawler’s design, as well as announcing a trailer set to debut tomorrow, November 11.\nAs you can see in the image above, Spider-Man pretty much looks like Spider-Man. He’s got subtle unique features such as a black grip on the gloves but he doesn’t look much different than his traditional design or what previous alterations have done. We’re not complaining; we’re happy to see Spidey in his familiar glory. \nSpidey joins the fray via the free \"With Great Power\" hero event. Billed as neither an Operation (like Kate Bishop/Hawkeye) or an expansion (like War for Wakanda), it's tough to know how big of an event this will be. The story focuses on Peter Parker uncovering a new threat and joining the Avengers to stop AIM from procuring dangerous, and mysterious, technology. Used to flying solo, Pete struggles with the dynamic of working on a team and we’ll see if he joins the Avengers full time or remains on his own by the end. Crystal Dynamics says the first trailer will premiere via IGN sometime tomorrow. \nFor non-PlayStation players, a big update also launches November 30 that adds a new four-player raid against Klaw, a power cap increase, and the arrival of the loot box-style Shipments. You can read more details about those additions and more here. You can also read about Square Enix's disappointment in Avengers' performance here. \nWhat do you think of Crystal Dynamics’ take on Spider-Man? Let us know in the comments!",

          "description": "Industry figure Geoff Keighley has revealed that his annual gaming awards show, aptly titled The Game Awards 2021, will feature somewhere between 40 to 50 games. \nThis news comes by way of a news post by Epic Games about the awards show and in it, Keighley revealed that he learned from last year’s event that “games and the trailers” are what drive the show. He also revealed that this year’s show will focus more on said games (and presumably trailers) and less on featured celebrities and musical performances. \n“You know, it’s great to have celebrities, it’s great to have music, but I think focusing really on games is important,” Keighley said. “Especially this year, there’ll be a lot of content for 2022 and 2023 that will be showing us our kind of biggest lineup yet of world premieres and announcements. What we learned last year was as that end of the day, it really is the games and the trailers that drive the show.” \nKeighley continued and revealed his Game Awards hand a bit, stating that he expects to feature 40 to 50 games “some way or another” this year. He then added that the number of new games announced during the show will probably be in the double digits. \nThe Game Awards as a whole have drawn criticism from some in the gaming community as being more focused on the game announcements and trailers rather than the actual awards handed out, but it seems that in Keighley’s eyes, they’re necessary in order to put on the show itself. \nThis year’s awards show will be held in-person, as opposed to last year’s mostly virtual event due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. They’ll air on Thursday, December 9. \nWhile waiting for the show, check out all of the winners from last year’s Game Awards show and then read about how The Game Awards 2020 broke an impressive viewership record after that.\nAre you excited about this year's show?

Epic surprisingly didn't create any skins for the recently released movie, Eternals.\nYou can take a look at all of the comic characters that were a part of a season or an event below:\nAnt-Man\nAquaman\nBatman\nThe Batman Who Laughs\nBeast Boy\nBlack Manta\nBlack Panther\nBlack Widow\nBlade\nBloodsport\nCable\nCaptain America\nCaptain Marvel\nCatwoman\nDaredevil\nDeadpool\nDeathstroke\nDoctor Doom\nDomino\nThe Flash\nGalactus\nGamora\nGhost Rider\nGreen Arrow\nGroot\nHarley Quinn\nIron Man\nThe Joker\nLoki\nMystique\nPoison Ivy\nPsylocke\nRaven\nShang-Chi\nShe-Hulk\nSilver Surfer\nStar-Lord\nStorm\nTaskmaster\nThanos\nThor\nVenom\nWolverine\nWonder Woman",

This November alone, the service is gaining Forza Horizon 5, It Takes Two, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas – The Definitive Edition, and more. However, the usual monthly announcement of Xbox Game Pass titles isn't always the only slew of games we learn are coming to the service. \nEvery now and then, Xbox likes to tease some surprise additions and today, the Xbox Game Pass Twitter account began to tease...something. \nThings are going to get a bit...orange this week\nNovember 8, 2021\nThis immediately got our minds racing: what could this game be? Our first thought was Valve Corporation's game collection, The Orange Box. Originally released in 2007, The Orange Box included Half-Life 2 and its two episodes, Team Fortress 2, and Portal. This collection was first released on PC and Xbox 360 before making its way to the PlayStation 3 two months later. While it's playable on Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One consoles today via backward compatibility, it's not currently on Xbox Game Pass. Today's tease seems to indicate it might be joining the lineup soon, though. \nBut what if it's not that? Well, we have some other ideas in mind too. Maybe it's the newly-released Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl, a Smash Bros.-like fighter starring characters from Nickelodeon TV series. If Nickelodeon is known for one thing (other than slime, of course), it's the color orange. It joining Xbox Game Pass would be a great way to beef up the player count and grow the excitement around the fighter. \nAnother famous \"orange\" in video games is Crash Bandicoot. Perhaps  Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time is coming to Xbox Game Pass. \nThat's enough from us, though. We want to hear what you think this bit of orange coming to Xbox Game Pass sometime this week is. Do you also think it's The Orange Box? What do you hope it is? Did we miss a classic orange in the world of video games? Let us know in the comments below!",

This year, BioWare released a blog post full of looking back at the series impact and this year's release of the Mass Effect Legendary Edition.\nThe blog also details new products fans can buy, sales on the games, and even new Mass Effect-themed Steam emotes. A giant infographic runs down the numbers on big choices Mass Effect Legendary Edition players went with, revealing 15% of people did not recruit Garrus, an option 85% of us can't calibrate our brains or our hearts to leave that precious boy behind. However, there's nary a mention about the future until the end of the post, which says, \"We are, of course, hard at work on the next adventure in the Mass Effect universe.\" We knew that, though, after a teaser trailer premiered at The Game Awards last year.\nIt looked like that's all there was to this year's N7 Day. That is until the image below was posted on Twitter:\nSpeculations are flying left and right, with thoughts and theories about every detail in the picture, from the type of ship parked at the lower half to the crew walking away from it (one looks Krogan, while the rest are humanoid, like most playable Mass Effect species). The crater located at the top of the image looks suspiciously like the head of a Geth, the synthetic beings potentially wiped out by one of the endings in Mass Effect 3. Now, I'm no expert on the series, but the similarities are certainly there.\nWe'll have to wait a little longer for confirmation on what exactly we're looking at here, but until then, we'll have fun watching ecstatic fans comb for any bits of information.\nWhat do you see in the teaser image? Are the Geth for sure back in the ME universe? Does the art have any hints of how BioWare will tie together the original trilogy with Andromeda? Are there other space races you can pick out of the starship lineup? Please give us your best guesses in the comments!",

This week we're tackling Samus' acclaimed Game Boy Advance outing, Metroid Fusion.\nMetroid Fusion launched on November 17, 2002 – the same day as Metroid Prime. Developed by Nintendo R&D1, it stars Samus as she explores a space station overrun by shapeshifting parasites called X. Worst of all, Samus is hunted by an X parasite that has mimicked her appearance and abilities: the SA-X. Metroid Fusion served as a return to the 2D gameplay of Super Metroid with modern improvements such as faster movement and traversal and a ledge grab. Fusion was critically acclaimed as one of the best GBA games ever made; some fans even consider it a rival to Super Metroid as the best entry in the series. Chronologically, Fusion served as the final chapter in the Metroid saga for decades until 2021's Metroid Dread. \nJoin hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and special guest Digital Eclipse editorial director Chris Kohler (@kobunheat) as we explore Metroid Fusion's lore, development history, and lasting impact. \nIf you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com.

          "description": "What makes a good shooter? Immediate answers might include punchy phrases/words like “gun feel” or “kit customization.” Even so, it’s hard to define the gratification that comes with securing that coveted victory in ranked multiplayer or surviving a seemingly never-ending onslaught in single-player horde mode. A good shooter tends to contain a smorgasbord of enticing components – gripping atmosphere, weapon/ability balancing, enjoyable arenas, etc. Regardless of style (e.g., FPS, third-person, top-down), the aforementioned features tend to mesh well with polished gameplay, sweeping narratives, and new or improved mechanics. If you feel at home sprinting through multilayered environments, mowing down adversaries with precision and cunning, then the ten games on this list are definitely wort…",

That’s understandable; most games are animated in one form or another, so it’s easier to replicate an aesthetic than to find actors and build sets that match the source material exactly. On top of the myriad of live-action shows based on games, there’s an equally sizable, if not larger, slate of animated series on the horizon. If you’re a fan of animated takes on the medium, here’s a snapshot of every upcoming TV series to keep an eye on with trailer links where applicable.  \n  \n\n\n\n      \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nArcane\nPlatform: Netflix - Release: November 6\nOne of the most popular competitive games on the planet, League of Legends, gets its own animated series this week.

          "description": "Skyrim’s 10th anniversary is upon us and Bethesda is re-releasing it, yet again – this time packaged as the Anniversary Edition. \nThis new edition includes every piece of Creation Club content ever released, including additional quests, armor, and gameplay modes. It also comes with a new-gen patch for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S players. When the Anniversary Edition was announced back in August, Bethesda revealed that the new-gen update would be free to all who own the Special Edition of Skyrim, which was released during the previous generation of consoles. \nHowever, those Special Edition players would need to pay in order to get the Creation Club content. A price for both this upgrade to get the new content and the actual Anniversary Edition was not announced at that time, though. Thanks to a new Anniversary Edition FAQ released today, we know the price to both, as reported by IGN. \n“The MSRP for the Skyrim Anniversary Edition on digital storefronts will be USD $49.00… at launch,” the FAQ reads. “If you already own Skyrim Special Edition, the MSRP for the Anniversary Upgarde on digital storefronts will be USD $19.99… at launch.” \nPhysical editions of it will be available for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One systems, according to Bethesda, and prices and availability may vary from retailer to retailer. In terms of what to expect with the new-gen upgrade, Bethesda says “the upgrade will be free and optimize the game with enhanced graphics, faster loading times, and more.” \nAll trophies and achievements will transfer over from the Special Edition to the Anniversary Edition, as well, except when upgrading from the PS4 version to the PS5 version. The Anniversary Edition will be released on November 11.\nFor more about Skyrim, check out our thoughts on the original release nearly a decade ago and then read about the history of Skyrim re-releases.

In it, Miyamoto told investors that the upcoming Mario movie is basically done and that Nintendo is feeling very positive about it. \nDon’t get too excited just yet, though – Nintendo doesn’t plan on releasing the movie early despite it being essentially done. It’s still planned for Holiday 2022. Miyamoto reportedly said that Nintendo really wants to meet fans’ expectations with this Mario movie and that as a result, it will use the extra time to continue polishing the film ahead of its release next year. \nElsewhere in Miyamoto’s discussions about the movie, he said that Nintendo is planning ot make more movies based on its other properties, citing a desire for people to experience said properties in a variety of ways (rather than just video games). He said Nintendo will make each movie one by one, though, so as not to have multiple in production, which could affect each’s quality. \nThese comments come just days after rumors of a Donkey Kong movie headed by Seth Rogen, who is voicing Donkey Kong in the Mario movie, began to swirl around, as noted by VGC. Only time will tell what the next Nintendo movie is, but considering Donkey Kong and Cranky Kong, who will be voiced by Fred Armisen, have already been cast, a Donkey Kong movie sounds like a safe bet. \nWhile waiting to learn more about Nintendo’s movie plans, check out the full cast list for the upcoming Mario movie. \n[Source: Video Games Chronicle]\nWhat franchise do you want to see Nintendo bring to the big screen?

That’s less than two weeks away and what better way to get excited about the dubs you’ll hopefully be getting in the battle royale than by watching the new opening movie for The First Soldier. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nSet 30 years before the events of Final Fantasy VII, The First Soldier is about, well, the first soldiers that the Shinra electric Company began using on the outskirt battlefields of Midgar. As expected, the opening movie is completely CG and it doesn’t really feature anything to do with the actual battle royale aspect of The First Soldier, save for the last few seconds that show some characters jumping out of a helicopter in a very battle royale fashion. \nYou can pre-register for the battle royale now and doing so could get you some pre-registration rewards, determined by how many people actually pre-register: \n300,000: Chocobo Egg\n500,000: Shinra Mask Skin\n770,000: Shinra Bike Skin\n1,000,000: Shinra Utility Vehicle Skin\n2,000,000: Shinra Helicopter Skin\nThe 75-player Final Fantasy VII battle royale will be released in 12 days on iOS and Android devices on November 17. \nWhile waiting for that, check out the latest details we learned about Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier and then read about Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis, the other Final Fantasy VII-centric mobile game Square Enix announced earlier this year. \nWill you be playing Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier later this month?

The team needs more time to develop the 1.0 update and squash bugs currently present in the current “demo” version of the game, which is what Konami refers to it at this point in time, as noted by IGN. \n“We would like to inform you that the v1.0.0 update for eFootball 2022, scheduled to be released on November 11, 2021, has been postponed until Spring 2022,” the blog post reads. “Also, we would like to announce the cancellation and automatic refunds of eFootball 2022 Premium Player Pack, which includes items that can only be used in-game after the v1.0.0 update.”\nKonami says it has been working diligently towards distributing an update that will bring new content to the game, including a mode new to the series where players can “strengthen and play with an original team” and the mobile versions to the market. However, those mobile versions have seemingly been delayed indefinitely. \n“Unfortunately, we have concluded that more time is needed to deliver the product in the quality that will meet the expectations of our users and have decided to postpone the delivery,” the blog post reads. \nIn the meantime, Konami ways it will release v0.9.1 to “fix numerous bugs sequentially on each platform” starting today, and that over time it will continue to improve and update eFootball 2022. Further updates and details about the mobile versions will come at a later date.\nFor more information, check out what we thought of one of the most recent eFootball games in Game Informer’s eFootball PES 2020 review and then read about how EA is considering changing the name of its ongoing FIFA franchise.  \nHave you been playing eFootball 2022?
