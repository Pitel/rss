Visually striking with ink drawings and a deep branching narrative, the duo put the studio on the map from episode one, and fans have been lapping it up since.\nBut one episodic release just wasn't enough, and in 2023, the team launched Slay the Princess, a visual novel that asks you to do what the game says on the tin: slay the princess. It's an expectations-subverting masterclass that received rave reviews upon its release on Steam. A year later, Tony and Abby are back with an expanded version of the game that's coming to all consoles — Slay The Princess - The Pristine Cut.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Old dog, new tricks.\nA couple years ago, a small studio called Medallion Games released a cute platformer called Grapple Dog, which as you could probably guess, is a platformer about a dog with a grappling hook. The simple premise played host to an impressively well-made and enjoyable adventure that felt like a meaningful homage to — and evolution of — classic platformer game design, although it never quite captured the audience that it deserved. Clearly sales were sufficient to justify a sequel, however, and Medallion Games has now graced us with Grapple Dogs: Cosmic Canines. This sophomore outing for Pablo and friends proves to be an even stronger game than the first one, and we’d highly suggest you give it a look if you’re a fan of 2D platformers.\nGrapple Dogs picks up almost immediately where its predecessor left off, which teased that Pablo’s adventure wasn’t quite over with his defeat of the robot, Nul. It turns out that Nul’s antics inadvertently released an evil godlike being named Vyr, which threatens to destroy the entire multiverse if the four pieces of the shattered Allkrystal aren't collected. Pablo isn’t the only hero whose universe has a stake in this brewing conflict, however, and he's soon joined on his quest by another grapple dog named Luna—a no-nonsense, gun-wielding pup who doesn’t have time to play nice. Together, the two set out to track down the pieces of the Allkrystal and hopefully find a way to defeat Vyr before all is lost.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Showcasing a modest but noticeable boost (at least when zooming in on the pixels as the presentation did) to several games in Sony's back catalogue — including Marvel's Spider-Man 2 (2023), Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart (2021), and The Last of Us II Remastered (2024) — the price was then revealed: $699 / £699 / €799.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

NBA 2K25 is the same game we saw 12 months ago, but, somehow, with even fewer features than its predecessor.

So while a revival of Yars’ Revenge really shouldn’t have come as much of a surprise, we have to admit to being a bit taken aback by Yars Rising. After all, what was once a stylish, yet basic top-down shooter has now been transformed into a full-blown Metroidvania with anime-inspired character design, a bonkers, world-ending plot, and gameplay that blends stealth, hacking, and good ol’-fashioned gunplay. Atari, yer mad.\nThe thing is, though, it works. We can’t imagine that this is the future kids in the early ‘80s had in mind when they first shoved that massive Yars’ Revenge cartridge into an Atari 2600 (and maybe OG developer Howard Scott Warshaw’s long-gestating sequel will be more on par with expectations), but after completing Yars Rising, we honestly couldn’t be more thrilled by developer WayForward’s ambitious interpretation of such a classic.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

This might seem unreasonable if you're not into modding, but the price of updating a game is often that you break any mods designed for it. Hence, the parts of Minecraft's history many seasoned Minecraft modders - together with server owners and pro mapmakers - remember most fondly are the longer lulls between updates. \n Read more",

          "description": "Autumn is upon us, or \"fall\" if you're from the other side of the pond. The leaves flake from the boughs like the dandruff of Pan, god of the wild - pandruff, perhaps? The waters of the rivers thicken, rejecting the fading sunlight, and the big coffee chains start doing monstrous things with hazelnut syrup. The Maw is ascendant during the darker months, its constellations growing visible to the naked eye. We will need a steady dosage of new PC games to keep it quiescent. Fortunately, this week is looking quite bountiful.\n Read more",

          "description": "Well, if this isn’t a vastly impressive little gem I’m not sure what is. Qanga is a space exploration game set in a loading screen-less solar system. It features ship travel, combat, trade, and base building, and you can do all of it alone or with space mates. It’s got a demo, but it’s also on the cheaper end if you fancy buying into early access. Considering the pricing, I’d say it’s a real looker, too.\nRead more",

Ubiquitous wearable sci-fi shields repel any attack that comes in too fast, so everyone has to learn this unique, overtly dance-like form of close-quarters combat where every thrust and parry is necessarily slow and considered. Picture it: careful judgments of your movements, weighing up the right time to strike, every measured jab part of a wider strategy that culminates in the kill.\nMOBAs are like that. Both in the fights themselves, sort of, where probing lunges lead up to bursts of lethality, but more broadly in each match as a whole. They’re map-wide knife fights, where a thrust is a well-judged lane push and a parry a savvy item buy. At first, playing Smite 2 felt akin to watching on helplessly as my opponents repeatedly shoved their crysknives through my ribs. After 30 hours, it often still feels like that - but I am enjoying myself. Mostly. Despite Valve’s third-person elephant in the lane. \nRead more",

While approaches to 4X and grand strategy vary hugely between games, factions and players, the genre as a whole is firmly wedded to imperial conquest, both structurally and at the level of narrative aspects and set-dressing. Many 4X games are triumphal re-enactments of specific periods of colonial settlement and expansion. All of which is to say that Syphilisation is fascinating. It's a reworking of the genre which dismantles and reconstructs concepts such as diplomacy, research and production.

While it wasn't outstanding in the grander landscape of gaming, enough Warhammer 40K fans seem to have cherished the escapades of bulky blue boltgunner Demetrian Titus for the action game to merit a sequel a decade later. It left its story on something of a cliffhanger, with said hero being dragged away to face untold tortures by the Inquisition, the most zealous sect of this preternaturally paranoid sci-fi universe. Today, Titus is free again. Free to stomp towards hordes of alien foes, blast them with a plasma incinerator, and shred the stragglers with a chainsaw sword. Space Marine 2 is an often-satisfying scrapper that has me  convinced of 40K's merit as a crafting ground for excellent-looking environments and creatures, even if I'm not particularly moved by the bland character of Titus and his fellow Ultramarines.\nRead more",

          "description": "I took a longer lunch break today, and must now Pay The Reaper by staying after work. Fortunately, I've spent my penance playing the demo for Witching Stone, which applies the magic of shape-matching to the magic of, well, magic. Out on 16th September, it's a pixelart charmer that \"combines elements of puzzle games, roguelites and deckbuilders\", much as you'd combine a red circle and two golden triangles to spark a lightning bolt.\n Read more",

          "description": "In the first post for my series on \"saving\" open world design, I complained that many of today's open worlds feel like checklists of formulaic tasks and rewards, their geography a vaporous staging ground for itemisable, cycling content-gathering opportunities, which flies in the face of the sense of freedom and wonder they're supposed to inspire. My interviewees, Elder Scrolls veterans Matt Firor and Nate Purkeypile, argued that this reflects the expense and scale of today's open world productions, which constrains experimental design both at a practical level and in terms of overall direction.\nCD Projekt open world designer Jakub Tomczak doesn't, as far as I know, have an answer to the issue of production bloat, but he does have a disarmingly obvious solution to the 'checklist problem', based on his time creating missions for Cyberpunk 2077 and its Phantom Liberty expansion: get better at hiding the checklist. Weave it into the landscape and setting more artfully, with an elegant balance of randomisation and responsiveness to the player's behaviour which keeps everything fresh. \r\n\n \nRead more",

It was a copy of The Game of Life, possibly the least exciting board game a child can win.\nThe game was dog water, and there’s probably a lesson in there somewhere about how cool and good it is to whine until you get free things, but we don’t have time for that. Instead, I’d like to draw your attention to Floops Big House Adventure. It’s a grungy, slimy, Aaahh!!! Real Monsters meets Ren and Stimpy Saturday morning shooter.

It blew the dust from my synapses.\nThe same appears true of King-Spooner's upcoming Judero, on which he is collaborating with Soul Searching developer Talha Kaya. It casts you as a \"pagan seer\" armed with a big stick, who is searching the mythical Scottish borderlands for evil creatures to clobber. It looks cheerier and airier than Sluggish Morss, with a more overt emphasis on mechanics such as combat, but it has the same pickled 3am energy to it.

Until the next time I have to write about Andrew Wilson.\n“Oil just use my trusty knoife” mutters Sid as I take down my first guard. Straight away, the animation and noise indicators evoke the same Shadow Tactics or Desperados III goodness you’re probably expecting. Fine with me - that’s exactly what I’m here for.

          "description": "Stormgate is a confusing proposition. It's an RTS directed by former Blizzard developers that is almost, but not quite, entirely unlike StarCraft. It's a free-to-play game, but has a business model that makes you feel like you're getting a rougher deal than if you just dropped thirty notes for it outright. It's available now in Early Access, but has already been available in a kind of gravity-defying Super Early Access for several weeks (which you had to pay to get into).\r\n\n\r\nAll of which has made me feel very tired, and yearn for the days when you went into a shop and bought a game in a box for a set amount of money, and the whole game was in the box and you went home and put it on your PC and played it until your mum said \"Richard!\" (only my mum calls me Richard) \"get off that computer and go outside and get some exercise! Do you want to be dead at 35?\" Well, I'm 36 now mum. Nearly 37. So who's laughing through their heart palpitations now?\r\n\n \nRead more",

While it would be a monumentally silly heel turn to go back on their promise of only charging Space Marine 2 players extra for cosmetics a mere week and change before the shooter’s September 9 release date,  the new year one roadmap does at least look piously forthright.\nChatting to James at Gamescom recently (possibly from his cathedral ship made out of graphics cards), Saber boss Tim Willits dragged out an armoured horse and proceeded to flog it mercilessly, saying that players don’t want to be sold the equivalent of Oblivion's infamous deadbeat daddy of DLCs. As several of you identified, this seemed like an odd comparison when Spice Maureen 2 specifically plans to charge for comparable cosmetics, although I imagine Willits was referencing the “packs” that his space game’s baubles come in. “Our fans never thought we ripped them off in World War Z,” he said, comparing Space Marine 2’s optional spendables to that game.\nWhether you see the cosmetic's pricing as egregious or not, yesterday’s roadmap does look to make good on Saber’s promise to keep wearables and playables separate.

He is, however, never stepped upon by a mech with a missile launcher. He is never given a shotgun and tasked with shooting the other animals.

There are some eclectic choices that come up, and that’s what I’m always hungry for. This month, there’s a game you should try. Mr. Mosquito is peak ‘00s weirdness.\n\n\nIt’s a pretty cool month. Not that I’m subscribed to Extra or Premium, but if you are, there’s some cool stuff. Plucky Squire is a pretty exciting upcoming title and Night in the Woods is pretty boss (so I’ve heard). I’ll give you the full list from Sony’s blog in just a minute, but first, let’s talk about Mr. Mosquito.\n\n\nImage via Sony\n\n\nActually, I did a full write-up of Mr. Mosquito. Is it a good game? Not really. However, it’s an interesting and unique game, which makes it worth playing. You take the role of a mosquito that has to harass a family until they all suffer a catastrophic mental breakdown. I can really relate to that. It’s the sort of weird concept that was more common back before publishers learned that the only way to make enough money to feed their super-yacht addictions is to put a dude with a gun on the cover.\n\n\nYou’ve also got Skygunner, a decent 2001 on-rails shooter from back when those were still a thing. There’s also Secret Agent Clank from the days when there was far too much Ratchet & Clank.\n\n\nNow I will paste… No, wait, they formatted this in a very unpaste-able way. I’m going to have to go through this individually. Okay, well, here’s the list:\n\n\nPlayStation Plus Extra and Premium | Game Catalog\n\n\n\nThe Plucky Squire | PS5\n\n\nUnder The Waves | PS4, PS5\n\n\nNight in the Woods | PS4, PS5\n\n\nChernobylite | PS4, PS5\n\n\nWild Card Football | PS4, PS5\n\n\nSpace Engineers | PS4, PS5\n\n\nRoad 96 | PS4, PS5\n\n\nBen 10 | PS4\n\n\nFar Cry 5 | PS4\n\n\n\nPlayStation Premium | PS VR2 & Classics\n\n\n\nPistol Whip | PS VR2\n\n\nSecret Agent Clank | PS4, PS5\n\n\nSky Gunner | PS4, PS5\n\n\nMister Mosquito | PS4, PS5\n\n\nThe post Mr. Mosquito is coming back as part of September’s PlayStation Plus update appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The top 25 list for LaLiga has been revealed for EA FC 25, and it's dominated by the Spanish giants Barcelona and Real Madrid.\n\n\nThat's not surprising, given the duo has always been the two top dogs of the league. Both squads have several Spanish and global superstars among their ranks, and many of them have found a place on the top 25 list. Without further ado, let's take a look at who has made the cut, along with the best cards.\n\n\nComplete list of top 25 LaLiga players in EA FC 25\n\n\nLet's first take a look at all the cards, along with their overall ratings and base positions.\n\n\n\nKylian Mbappe ST 91\n\n\nJude Bellingham CAM 90\n\n\nVini Jr. LW 90\n\n\nThibaut Courtois GK 89\n\n\nMarc Andre Ter Stegen GK 89\n\n\nAntoinne Griezmann ST 88\n\n\nRobert Lewandowski ST 88\n\n\nFederico Valverde CM 88\n\n\nJan Oblak GK 88\n\n\nAntonio Rudiger CB 88\n\n\nFrenkie De Jong CM 87\n\n\nRodrygo RW 86\n\n\nLuka Modric CM 86\n\n\nDani Carvajal RB 86\n\n\nPedri CM 86\n\n\nUnai Simon GK 86\n\n\nEder Militao CB 85\n\n\nJules Kounde CB 85\n\n\nNico Williams LM 85\n\n\nAurelien Tchouameni CDM 85\n\n\nDavid Alaba CB 85\n\n\nRonald Araujo CB 85\n\n\nMamardashvili GK 85\n\n\nIago Aspas ST 84\n\n\nAlex Remiro GK 84\n\n\n\n\n\nAs far as the ratings are concerned, Real Madrid has managed to trump their traditional rivals. The top three cards all belong to the Madrid giants: Kylian Mbappe, Jude Bellingham, and Vinicius. Out of them, Bellingham has received one of the biggest buffs—he is rated at only 86 in EA FC 24.\n\n\nGoalkeeper Marc Andre Ter Stegen is Barcelona's highest-rated card this year, followed by Robert Lewandowski at 88. Based on the ratings, Real Madrid should be an excellent choice for many players in Seasons and Career Mode. Inaki Williams also experienced a big jump in his numbers following an impressive year for both the club and the country.\n\n\nWe will have detailed reviews for all these cards once EA FC 25 goes live in early access on September 20.\n\nThe post EA FC 25: Top 25 LaLiga players appeared first on Destructoid.",

So, to eliminate any confusion on the matter, this is what you need to know.\n\n\nHow to pick your class in Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2\n\n\nTo pick your class in Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2, you must complete the tutorial mission. Once you get through the ropes of the game and get to the Battle Barge for the first time, you should receive a message that says “Online play is available now”.\n\n\nWith that message, you can now go to the Strategium which is where you’d talk to Acheran in the Campaign. You can also go to the Launch Bay if you're not here. At either place, you can interact with the console which will bring up the Battle Map. \n\n\nIf you switch to either Operations or Eternal War, you will be shown a menu asking if you want to switch modes, simply say yes. You’ll then be told to choose a class you want to play. Don’t worry, you are not locked into your class by picking any of these.\n\n\nSome classes may be unavailable based on when you join a lobby. If you join a lobby in progress, some classes may already be chosen. Be wary of that if you’re maining a particular class.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nHow to change class in Space Marine 2\n\n\nIf you want to change your class in Space Marine 2, head over to the Armouring Hall room. You can fast-travel here before mission selection and when a mission is set. \n\n\nWhile you’re customizing your Marine in this room, your last selected class will be the one you will equip. \n\n\nFor example, if you want to run the Bulwark class, hit back while on this menu. When you’re finished customizing your armor and loadout, do not switch to another class or you will swap to them when you exit the customization.\n\nThe post How to change class in Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "With Mythic dungeons finally available for play in WoW: The War Within, you might be wondering exactly when these dungeons will be reset once you've completed them. Whether you're a new player curious about the mechanic, or an old player potentially confused thanks to Mythic history, here's all that you need to know.\n\n\nWhat time do Mythic 0 Dungeons reset in WoW: The War Within\n\n\nIn the past, Mythic dungeons (now known as Mythic 0) had a weekly reset, allowing you to complete each dungeon only once per week. This made gear drops from Mythic dungeons relatively scarce, despite being among the best pre-raid gearing options available.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nFast forward to The War Within, and the rules have changed significantly. Since the introduction of Mythic+ in Battle for Azeroth, Blizzard has continually refined the system, enhancing the fun and challenge, but diminishing the relevance of Heroic and Mythic 0 dungeons. While The War Within doesn't impact Heroics much, it completely revamps Mythic 0, which now reset daily and is notably more challenging to complete. As a result, Mythic 0 dungeons now drop much better loot (still inferior to Mythic+ and Raid gear) and have a much longer lifespan in the current gearing climate.\n\n\nTo be more specific, Mythic 0s reset around 8:00 am PST, allowing you to jump in for another chance at higher tier loot. If you're still not sure exactly when the reset is, type /raidinfo in your in-game chat to see all your lock-out information. If you're looking to jump into the first raid of The War Within, then know that Mythic 0 dungeons are worth grinding out to get a leg up on your item level.\n\n\n\nThe post When do Mythic 0 Dungeons reset in WoW: The War Within? appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Sony finally announced the PlayStation 5 Pro on September 10, 2024, at the Technical Presentation, and its staggering $700 price tag has left fans wondering who it's for.\n\n\nFor starters, the PS5 Pro will primarily be a digital console with the option of an attachable disc drive, much like the PS5 Slim released in November 2023. The fact that has left most fans upset is the $700 price tag excludes the disc drive and a vertical stand.\n\n\nImage via Sony\n\n\nThe disc drive and the vertical stand cost an additional $79.99 and $29.99 each, so the final price of the console turns out to be roughly $810. The lack of these amenities has made some fans on PlayStation subreddit say \"This price is a joke.\"\n\n\nSome fans on the same Reddit thread think that the lack of competition in the console space has led Sony to make such a decision. \"People on this sub might not want to hear this but we need the rise of Xbox again. Without competition in the console space, Sony is going to keep taking more and more advantage of its user base,\" said a fellow fan.\n\n\nThe first game shown during the PS5 Technical Presentation was The Last of Us Part II which initially came out for the PS4 in 2020 and at this point, it's four years old. A user on this X post said, \"The jokes write themselves at this point\" while another chimed in, \"The fact this game not running at 120fps on the pro means it's not worth it.\"\n\n\nUpgrades can feel like diminishing returns or something too granular to notice, too. The X posts below shows as much.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAriZona Tea even got in on the jokes, showing how the cash for a PS5 Pro could instead be spent on 700 cans of tea.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSure, the PlayStation 5 Pro promises better performance with a larger GPU, advanced ray-tracing, and AI-driven upscaling, but coming in at a $700 price tag has clearly left the fans exasperated.\n\nThe post People are balking at the PS5 Pro’s $700 price tag appeared first on Destructoid.",

Sure, you've clocked the classic games more times than you've eaten soup, but the vanilla experiences are just the beginning. Modding is where it's at, yo.\n\n\nLook, you know how this works. I tell you about a Doom mod and you all go and check it out. This one is not quite like the others, though. It has colors, for starters. Spaceverse: Bunny Maze from ModDB user SmilingFaceMedia offers something a little different to just a graphics tweak or some modern innovations.\n\n\nImage via SmilingFaceMedia/ModDB.\n\n\nIt's a rather bright (red: very teal) FPS that has you playing as a \"virtual man\" who's stuck in a virtual maze, full of habitants known as \"Lunar Bunnies.\" That sounds fun, until it becomes apparent that these humanoid bunnies are out to kill you.\n\n\nAlways with the killing\n\n\nAs the creator says, there's more to Spaceverse than just shooting and surviving. You also have to use your intellectual moxie to navigate the maze. Oh dear, thinks I.\n\n\nThe mod has been built for GZDoom, specifically, and does come with a warning. I'll let SmilingFaceMedia field this one:\n\n\n\nSpaceverse: Bunny Maze contains imagery, flashing colours, and other content that may upset some players. If you happen to be epileptic or easily offended, then we discourage you from playing this game… for your own good. Spaceverse: Bunny Maze is also NOT compatible for mobile as it is only intended to play on PC.\n\n\n\n\nProbably best to make that message loud and clear.\n\n\nAs we move ever closer to the release of Doom: The Dark Ages – this time a medieval-themed entry in the iconic series – we should never forget where Doomguy came from. Yes, even if he's been turned into a virtual man who has to fight bunny girls.\n\nThe post This Doom mod has you playing in a colorful world full of bunnies appeared first on Destructoid.",

The color of paint with this Final Fantasy XIV paintbrush controller determines which skill is used for the Pictomancer Job; it's absolutely genius. \n\n\nWhen SuperLouis64 brushes blue onto the surface of paper on an easel, Final Fantasy XIV queues up the \"Holy in White\" attack. It makes thematic sense as the Pictomancer is a new class from Dawntrail that uses a paintbrush as a weapon.\n\n\n\n\n\"I spent the weekend prototyping a Paintbrush controller for Pictomancer and I finally cracked the code!!\" wrote SuperLouis64 on X. \"I ended up going with the plan of having the player scan colors of paint and then literally PAINT to use the ability.\"\n\n\nThe content creator says there's a lot left to build, but the \"prototype is amazing.\" It's likely this Final Fantasy XIV paintbrush controller will see its way to completion, as this isn't the first time SuperLouis64 has built a strange input for the game. He has previously made a gunblade controller made from NERF, where you shoot darts to fire at enemies and then use motion controls to swing the sword. Additionally, he's been able to punch foes using boxing gloves with the Monk class. \n\n\nThose aren't the craziest things that SuperLouis64 has done in the realm of gaming. We previously covered this content creator beating Elden Ring boss Godrick with a controller made from bananas. \n\n\nAnother amazing feat from the gaming community includes a feat from CarcinogenSDA, who rapidly beat Resident Evil 2 Remake without taking any damage during Games Done Quick 2024. \n\nThe post Final Fantasy XIV fan creates the perfect controller for Pictomancer Job, a paintbrush appeared first on Destructoid.",
