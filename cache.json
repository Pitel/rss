The RPG series has never been a huge hit outside of Japan, and this latest entry changed up the formula by making it a more open-world adventure.\nDeveloper Kadokawa Games has been working on a direct sequel called Metal Max: Wild West, first announced in 2019 (as Metal Max Xeno Reborn 2). The game was due to release on Nintendo Switch in Japan this year. However, the developer has been quiet on the game since May 2021.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

However, you can find updated comments relating specifically to the English language release at the bottom of the page.\n\nMetal Max fans in the West are not what you’d call spoiled for choice, especially in regards to English-language releases. It would be more accurate to say that series fans are “Metal Max-starved.” In the span of the series’ 31-year existence, only two games have been released in English —2006’s Metal Saga (thusly named due to trademark issues at the time) and 2018’s Metal Max Xeno. For English-speaking fans, it’s Metal Max Xeno that’s relevant here, as Metal Max Xeno: Reborn is, as the title suggests, a reimagining of that game.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

I'll be honest that maths has never been my strongest suit, but figuring out how games work under-the-hood is one of my favourite things to do. So I've spent most of this week chasing answers, and I've come up with a ballpark estimate of what it would cost to max out your character. The answer is: £46,000, or $51,000, to fully equip your character with the best gear as quickly as possible using premium currencies.\nRead more",

Not a chance. I wouldn't like it.\" People were shocked at my refusal. \"But nothing will go wrong!\" they exclaimed. This misses the universal truth that even - and indeed, especially - when it is guaranteed nothing will go wrong, something will always go wrong in space.\nHonestly, who can say that they've played a video game set on a space station and not encountered at least one deserted corridor plunged into darkness, but with one spotlight tipped over onto its side to cast ominous shadows? Raise your hands. Terror in space has never gone out of fashion, really, but the source of the terror does seem to go in cycles. In the 2010s a lot of the danger came from an AI gone a bit sinister and funny. As we saw at last night's Summer Game Fest, though, the monsters are back, baby.\nRead more",

Now, Demagog seem to be expanding their Wasteland-verse with a third entry: Highwater. It's not clear how this one relates to the others just yet, but it does feature a rather lovely yellow lifeboat in a flooded cityscape. Check out the reveal trailer below.\nRead more",

Just ask the many thousands of players who missed a shot with a 90% success chance in one of their XCOM reboots. Marvel’s Midnight Suns, however, could be the Civilization studio’s biggest gamble yet. Not only is it their first game to mix substantial RPG elements into its tactical combat, but there’s nary a hit percentage in sight. In the four hours I spent playing the opening of Midnight Suns last week, I saw precisely one scenario that had any kind of per cent number attached to it – and that was booting a goon (100%) or Venom, one of the newly confirmed villains of the game (0%), off a rooftop. All your other attacks, represented here as a deck of cards, are guaranteed hits.\nIt’s a strategic evolution I’ll talk about in a second, but this switch-up in approach isn’t the only part of Midnight Suns story that’s been subject to the whims of (mis)fortune. No sooner had Firaxis announced the game it was delayed in the snap of Thanos' fingers (from March to the second half of 2022, now confirmed as October 7th at tonight’s Summer Game Fest). But speaking to creative director Jake Solomon, the extra polishing time they set aside gave them an unexpected benefit. And it’s all down to a fish witch called Wanda.\nRead more",

Dreade Froste Beaste Wolfe. Anyway, one of them is made of decent people, developers who are fighting for better working conditions and making the best games they can under the circumstances. The other is Blizzard the organisation, a management structure seemingly incapable of making anything other than the worst decision possible in any given situation. So really, it's actually more like one wolf, and one flapping headless chicken (the chicken having also received a lot of allegations of harrassment and discrimination, and a lawsuit from the state of California). \nDiablo Immortal, which is currently on open beta for PC and out properly for mobile (both for free), was largely made by the wolf, and it's all right to play! However, I don't know why the chicken wanted to put it on PC in its current monetised form, apart from the fact it's a bad decision and we've already established those are the only kind of decisions the chicken can make.\nRead more",

The main character is based on one of the director's cats called Murtaugh. He's not an exact copy, but he's the main reference. We also have Oscar, who is a Sphynx, a furless cat, so he's a very good reference for animation because we can clearly see all the movements.

This is only available in your first play through in the deluxe version of the game, which I wasn't aware I was reviewing. The feature unlocks in the standard version after you've completed a full play through.\nI'm going to do my absolute best to tell you about The Quarry with no spoilers, but it will be hard because a lot of what marks it out as better and cleverer and funner than comparable horrorventure romps is all tangled up in the plot. It's an interactive story you control with split-second decisions and quick time events; it is mostly plot. Broadly, it is the story of a group of camp counselors, one night in a quarry-based summer camp, and how baffling organisational choice can lead to ruin.\nRead more",

          "description": "Going into my chat with Steve Piggott and Rasmus Löfström of Torn Banner Studios, I thought I had a reasonable grasp of the developer’s trajectory up to that point. After finding success in 2012 with their breakout hit Chivalry: Medieval Warfare, Torn Banner had gone on to compose the difficult second album Mirage: Arcane Warfare – an Arabian Nights-inspired take on Chivalry’s multiplayer melee combat. Mirage had not been as well-received as Chivalry, yet despite this stumbling block, the studio had found its feet again with Chivalry 2, a souped-up sequel to their earlier work with more nuanced combat, bigger maps, and support for 64-player battles.\nIt turns out that, while broadly correct, I wildly underestimated Torn Banner’s reversal of fortunes. In the five years between the launch of Mirage and Chivalry 2’s impending Steam release, Torn Banner has gone from a studio on the brink to being more successful than its leadership ever imagined.\nRead more",

Some of it is great even, but I’ve jumped between loving and hating so many different bits over my last week with the PC beta that ultimately I’m just sad.

Both because he's a fan of the FPS genre and to be present with a jar in hand, lest I crumbled into dust. Thankfully this didn't happen and we had a pretty swell time, I'd say. It's early days for the game but there's potential there.\nRead more",

          "description": "Xalavier Nelson Jr has a bit of a love hate relationship with screens right now. As development on his studio’s gutsy market game Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator was wrapping up at the end of last year, he tells me he remembers “just being really angry at the concept of the borders of the screen”. He was, by his own admission, in “a vague fugue state” at the time, having spent months immersed in Space Warlord’s black and green trading interfaces. But the feeling of having his game “chained to these walls” at the edge of his monitor proved to be a surprisingly powerful one - so much so that it spurred Nelson Jr and his team at Strange Scaffold to create an entirely new kind of game in the months leading up to Warlord’s release: Witch Strandings.\r\n\nThat's right. Taking cues from Hideo Kojima’s hiking postal sim Death Stranding, Witch Strandings is a game that not only asks what Sam Bridges’ cross-country cargo routes might look like if they were made with a fraction of Kojima’s development budget, but also how games can create experiences that are “larger than my screen,” says Nelson Jr. And the answer, it turns out, lies in your PC’s humble mouse.\nRead more",

          "description": "It's a sweet symphony\nNetflix has confirmed a new Castlevania animated series is on the way, and it's centered around a new Belmont. Castlevania: Nocturne is officially in production for Netflix, featuring Richter Belmont.\nThe new trailer from Netflix's Geeked Week stream doesn't show too much, other than a good look at Richter himself. Still, he's here, in full Belmont garb and whip in tow.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONqNEPTPyqU\nRichter is a descendant of Trevor Belmont and Sypha Belnades, so that should make for an interesting continuation of the show. And longtime Castlevania fans are probably already very excited about Nocturne tackling Richter, considering his source material. Video game Richter means both Rondo of Blood and Symphony of the Night could be fodder for adaptation.\nThe series will be led by showrunner Kevin Kolde and creator/writer Clive Bradley, and produced by Project 51 Productions with production services from Powerhouse Animation.\nRondo round the world\nConsidering the Castlevania Netflix series has traditionally been a looser adaptation of the source material, I wouldn't expect Castlevania: Nocturne to be a full-on retelling of Rondo of Blood or Symphony of the Night. That said, Richter alone provides a lot of fodder for potential story beats between those two games. Plus, having Richter here means we could see the return of Alucard. Who doesn't want that?\nWe got a tease of this last year, but it's excellent to see the Castlevania adaptations are carrying on. While the streaming service has had some standouts in the adaptation department, Castelvania remains one of my favorites. The storming-the-castle finale of Season 2 is forever seared in my brain. I'm more than ready for some adventures with Richter.\nThe post Castlevania: Nocturne is coming to Netflix, following Richter Belmont appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Coming to the Epic Games Store on PC\nDid you know there's an Epic Games Store showcase going on right now? Me neither! More Lord of the Rings-licensed games are on the way beyond that vague EA mobile project and the Gollum title; as The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria was just announced today.\nThe trailer opens up at the Doors of Durin, before showcasing a group of dwarves (players) quite literally heading back into Moria. Social elements (group drinking), survival moments (evading orcs that are still skulking about the halls), crafting, and building seem to be in play. Development is handled by Free Range Games, who has worked as an external developer on several titles, and handled primary development for Spelldrifter.\nHere's a quick description that sums up the vibe:\n\"To survive the treacherous mines of Moria players must conserve resources, hunt and gather for food and manage their sleep, temperature and noise levels. Utilize dynamic light systems for safety and to blaze a path further into the darkness. Battle unspeakable evils and survive hordes of monstrous Orcs in visceral combat, while uncovering the secret of the Shadow that looms within the mountain.\"\n\nEight-player co-op is on the table, which is likely one of the bigger selling points of Return to Moria for the studio. A spring 2023 window for the Epic Games Store is teased. The copyright is with Middle-earth Enterprises (not the Tolkien Estate), so like other similar projects, they'll be limited in what they can cover from The Legendarium (as is customary for the vast majority of Tolkien-related media). But given that the core book series pretty much gives them free rein on Moria, they should be good there.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75nbOL7GOPE\nThe post Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria is a…Tolkien survival simulator? appeared first on Destructoid.",

It'll follow a set of new characters from the world of Dragon Age. That includes elves, Qunari, mages, knights, and some other surprises.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2A1PSiPSs_k\nDragon Age: Absolution is set in Tevinter, which has some interesting implications. Plus, with the next Dragon Age game also heading Tevinter, the Netflix series could potentially set up storylines. Or it might just be a good entry point for newcomers. Either way, Tevinter is definitely an interesting place to go; it's a region full of magic, mystery, and intrigue.\nThe Dread Wolf nears\nAs for the Dragon Age series in the gaming realm, BioWare recently announced the title for its next entry. Dragon Age: Dreadwolf will be the next mainline game, with the player heading to Tevinter and dealing with a lingering threat in Solas.\nThe latest Dragon Age has been in development for a while, and BioWare has confirmed it won't launch in 2022. Basically, it's going to be a while before we get a new virtual adventure in Thedas. In the meantime, this streaming series will be something for fans to dig into and pick apart, at the least.\nDragon Age: Absolution is another step of Netflix diving deeper into the world of video game adaptations, too. A new Cyberpunk anime was already announced, and its live-action Resident Evil adaptation arrives soon. Today's stream also had news about Netflix's Tekken series, The Cuphead Show, and the next book of Dota: Dragon's Blood.

Like, busy for the last five years or so, busy. Cuphead came out in September of 2017! From the original PC and Xbox One platforms it expanded to Switch in 2019, and PS4 in 2020. But it definitely feels like it came out recently, namely due to the airtight gameplay and evergreen aesthetic. If what we've seen of the Delicious Last Course DLC is representative of what's to come, odds are it'll be relevant for even longer. Here's our Cuphead DLC preview.\nWe had the chance to sit down and watch a hands-off presentation of the Cuphead DLC, hosted by Chad, Jared, and Maja Moldenhauer; as well as Studio MDHR producer Eli Cymet.

In a really cool turn, you can listen to these radio plays in-game via your Pip-Boy (on the Pirate Radio station).\nIn other Fallout 76 news, Season 9 and the Test Your Metal update is set to arrive on June 14, which will inject a ton of new content into the game beyond the typical season pass refresh.

          "description": "Super Star, Dream Land 3, and Dream Course\nNintendo just added three new Kirby SP games to the Switch Online service: building upon the existing original versions that already existed on Switch. As a reminder, \"SP\" versions are modified editions of Switch Online NES or SNES games that essentially have a \"cheat/unlock\" save out of the box. That's really it.\nBreaking this down, here's what the Switch Online Kirby SP games do:\nKirby Super Star SP: You get Revenge of Meta Knight mode access immediately\nKirby's Dream Land 3 SP: An easier difficulty/extras are available\nKirby's Dream Course SP: Extras unlocked, including more multiplayer stages (this is probably the most useful of the three)\nSP versions started off as a cute little flight of fancy bonus, but at this point people are asking for an option to hide them entirely from the interface: which has become more unwieldy and bloated as more games have been added. Initially \"SP\" seemed like something special, like maybe an official ROM hack or a different edition of a classic game: but they turned out to just be, by and large, save-doctored retreads.\nAnother issue is that Nintendo potentially sees these as \"updates,\" which slows down future games from becoming part of the service sooner. It's tough to tell what the actual cadence of games is for the Switch Online service by any metric, as \"slow\" generally sums it up: from the launch of the NES service all the way to the current era of Nintendo 64 and Genesis.\nThe post Nintendo just added three new Kirby SP SNES games to Switch Online appeared first on Destructoid.",

A new report indicates God of War Ragnarok is on track for a November launch, with a release date reveal expected later this month.\nBloomberg reports via three sources familiar with the project that God of War Ragnarok is planned for November. This comes after an earlier report that the new God of War had slipped to 2023.\nJason Schreier of Bloomberg cast doubt on the 2023 news yesterday. His new report seems to affirm that Ragnarok will arrive this year. No dates are set in stone with development, but the report indicates that as of this week, it's still on track for November. Bloomberg's report does note that Ragnarok has slipped internally. Earlier this year, it was reportedly set to arrive in September, but was recently bumped to November.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE-4GvjKcfs\nThis is some reassuring news for fans who might have been concerned after God of War Ragnarok was absent from both the Sony State of Play and yesterday's Summer Game Fest. The follow-up to 2018's God of War has been a hotly anticipated game since it was first teased.\nFimbulwinter in November\nWhile some ratings board movement indicated Ragnarok may still be set for this year, today's report adds some more certainty. As of this writing, Sony has not officially announced a date for God of War Ragnarok, outside a 2022 window.\nIt's been a leaky couple of days for Sony, as The Last of Us Remake news slipped out ahead of schedule yesterday. The rekindling of the original Last of Us was set to be the closer for Summer Game Fest.\nThe June State of Play held last week focused mainly on third-party titles, so it's no surprise people are curious about what Sony's first-party lineup looks like right now. Hopefully as the summer of games news rolls on, we'll get a firmer idea of what's in store for PlayStation.\nThe post God of War Ragnarok is reportedly planned to launch in November appeared first on Destructoid.",

Well Square Enix has a 10 minute Final Fantasy VII stream planned for June 16 at 6PM ET.\nFor reference, here's the quote:\n“There were a lot of shows last year where everyone was disappointed when they weren’t really press conferences, right? Like Take-Two, Capcom, Square Enix and things like that…I think [they] have learned that if you’re going to do a press conference, you kind of need to have 30 minutes-plus of stuff, and sometimes they only have one or two great games to show, which may not be enough to do a full event around. So I think that’s going to be a bit of a shift. I have a pretty good sense of what’s coming in the next month, and I think people will be hyped about games in general.”\n\nWelp!\nThe stream kicks off below at 6PM ET on June 16, with the following caveat from Tetsuya Nomura: \"At only around 10 minutes long, it will be short and sweet, but we have packed in lots of information, so I hope everyone can look forward to the unveiling.\" Add it to the pile! Less obvious candidates include a tease for Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 2 or some new media project; more obvious candidates are mobile developments for VII-related projects.\nIf Square Enix doesn't show anything related to Part 2  in this Final Fantasy VII stream, they're just setting themselves up for disappointment.

Instead, Sonic 3 & Knuckles will feature an \"adapted\" soundtrack, faithfully recreated by composer Jun Senoue.\nSonic fans had been awaiting news on the Sonic Origins soundtrack situation, well aware that Sonic 3 score is mired in misty red tape due to the alleged input of one Michael Jackson, who supposedly composed some of the game's tracks despite not actually being credited in-game. Since its release, both members of Michael Jackson's team and Sega executives have delivered mixed messages as to whether \"The King of Pop\" did indeed work on the best-selling Sega Mega Drive title, with no real confirmation either way.\nhttps://twitter.com/TailsChannel/status/1535011473218494487?s=20&t=PZcbCmTmIdkgAhJn58Zwnw\nIn a special Sonic Origins live stream held yesterday, social media manager Katie Chrzanowski clarified that the Sonic Origins edition of Sonic 3 & Knuckles will feature a recomposed version of the original score, with Senoue even utilizing original Sega Mega Drive technology and his original collection of Digital Audio Tape (DAT) to truly capture that classic 16-bit feel.\nWhile the fact that Sonic 3 is not being 100% replicated in its entirety will be a disappointment to the fanbase, Senoue is one of the best in the biz, with no doubt that the tweaked score will be equally as compelling as the one that Jackson did...

On one extreme, we saw the adorable 2D-meets-3D storybook adventure The Plucky Squire — and on the other, there was Anger Foot, a face-kicking action game for sickos.\nThe first gameplay glimpse from developer Free Lives (Broforce, GORN, Terra Nil) looks unhinged. I'm talking \"Academy Award winner Russell Crowe in Unhinged\" unhinged.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7R1XJv-pylk\nIt's one of the most no-bullshit, take-it-or-leave-it showings I've seen in a while, and I also appreciate the synopsis, which reinforces this game's unrelenting mood.\n\"Unleash the world's deadliest feet on a colorful cast of anthropomorphic enemies,\" as Devolver Digital and Free Lives put it. \"Clearing out slums, sewers, and skyscrapers as you grab new weapons, unlock new sneakers, and upgrade your powers in absurd and wonderful ways. Kick and shoot your way to the exit as you leave behind a smoldering trail of shattered doors, broken bones, and crumpled energy drinks.\"\nI can already tell Anger Foot will be the kind of game where there's an ideal \"wow, that went smooth!\" way to play, and getting the flow down just right will surely take practice. In the meantime, I'm sure it'll be funny to fumble your way through these setups, too. If you've ever wondered how Hotline Miami would (or could) translate its frantic room-clearing carnage to 3D, well, this is probably the closest we're getting for now.\nGeneral mood aside, you don't need to take the reveal trailer's word for it — there's a demo right now on Steam.

You, as a demon made of glass and pain, have to skate to the moon and swallow it to earn your freedom. Simple enough, right?\nSeeing it in motion, though, is something else.

And OlliOlli World takes a level-based approach with a story and goals that really added a lot to the experience.\nThat's what excites me about Skate Story in this trailer. It's a whole different vibe, and one I'm really gelling with the more I see it. Developer Sam Eng has posted some great technical looks at the tricks in play, and they are just a joy to watch.\nhttps://twitter.com/skatestorygame/status/1486147388255395840\nSuffice to say, I'm looking forward to nailing some sick tricks in the surreal dream world of Skate Story when it arrives in 2023.

Paying back your debt means assisting this spirit in taking over the woodlands and destroying the other prophets.\nAlong the way, you can recruit a following of other happy creatures to do your bidding. That means harvesting crops, building new structures, and gradually constructing a quaint home base you can visit between escapades.\n\nIt's a cool town-building twist on the usual action-roguelike formula.

No release date yet, but the game is available to wishlist on Steam right now, and it will be coming out on PC, Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and Nintendo Switch sometime in 2023.\nThe post The Plucky Squire is an imaginative new 2D and 3D combo adventure game appeared first on Destructoid.",

I was heavily reminded of the low-key artifice of the PC Gaming Show throughout, where it was hard to tell what was actually a reveal and what had been shown weeks or months ago. There were lots of ads and a few \"exclusives/world firsts\" that were basically modified existing trailers. The Rock stopped by through a Zoom call to plug his energy drink (twice) and showed off a trailer for his new movie, Black Adam.

          "description": "\"Insanity runs in our family\"\nAfter Blair Witch and The Medium, Bloober Team is returning to the world of Layers of Fear with a \"psychedelic\" horror game, Layers of Fears, that's being developed in Unreal Engine 5 alongside Anshar Studios. A trailer debuted at Summer Game Fest 2022 with familiar characters and scenes from the wider series, albeit looking better than ever.\nhttps://youtu.be/AwEXJ3T1EJM\nIt really feels like history is repeating itself, both in terms of the tortured artist storyline and the gameplay of Layers of Fear 1 and 2 (and Inheritance, the game with the painter's daughter, which is easily forgotten about and will likely end up feeling the freshest here). We've seen tons of remasters and even full-on remakes in recent years, but this is blurring the lines in a way that I wasn't expecting after Bloober Team's recent teases.\n\"Layers of Fears will be the complete, definitive, and at the same time unpredictable way to discover the stories of artists enslaved by their obsessions,\" according to Bloober Team. \"Prepare for an exquisite horror experience thanks to the expanded plot lines that will cast a new light on the overarching narrative.\" You can see some screenshots on Steam.\n\nThe developers say they're \"focused on tense exploration and immersive storytelling,\" though that's going to be a hard sell for some people based on the series so far.\nI personally have had my fun with Layers of Fear (and to a lesser extent its direct sequel), so I'm curious if Layers of Fears will end up feeling fresh enough, conceptually, to justify itself. The visual fidelity is clearly a step up from the original games, but that can only take me so far. In general, this spooky (?) series has a lot of fans — and a lot of haters.\nLayers of Fears is heading to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC through Steam and the Epic Games Store.\nThe post Layers of Fears captures the whole series in one new horror trip appeared first on Destructoid.",

The creator advertises thousands of options, from teeth and make-up to muscles, tattoos, and skin tints. Heck, even the veins are customizable in the Saints Row Boss Factory. It's a slider I never even thought to consider.\nThis character creator will let you get everything set, so your perfect Boss is ready by Aug. 23 when Saints Row launches on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.

Casey will fight alongside the turtles, their master Splinter, and beat-em-up reporter April O'Neil.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyfKYsSDDb4\nAlso confirmed is local and online co-op for up to six players.

But isn't that a plus?\nSix-player mayhem\nTMNT: Shredder's Revenge impressed me a lot when I played it at PAX East earlier this year, and adding both more players and Casey Jones is just icing on top. Dotemu's garnered a good reputation for brawlers at this point, with its previous work on projects like Streets of Rage 4.\nWith TMNT: Shredder's Revenge though, it really feels like they're honing in on that Saturday morning brawler feeling. In my demo, it felt fairly easy to pick up and play as anyone, and the fighters all felt very individual. After seeing April bash someone with a boom mic, I'm pretty thrilled to see what the team has concocted for Casey Jones. Add in a ton of multiplayer mayhem, and June's looking like a good time for a couch co-op party.\nThe brawling gets underway next week when TMNT: Shredder's Revenge hits PS4, Xbox One, PC, and Nintendo Switch on June 16.\nThe post TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge hits June 16, with Casey Jones in the lineup appeared first on Destructoid.",

Netflix originally announced The Cuphead Show way back in 2019, and it finally hit Netflix earlier this year. Shortly after – three weeks later, to be exact – Netflix revealed that it was renewing The Cuphead Show for a second season. Today's teaser doesn't seem to be about that second season but rather additional episodes of Season One. Check it out for yourself below: \n\n\nHere's what Netflix has to say about these new episodes: \nWhile waiting for these new episodes, check out this brand new gameplay from the upcoming Cuphead DLC, The Delicious Last Course and then read our preview thoughts on it afterward.  \nAre you excited about new episodes of The Cuphead Show?

Netflix's Sonic Prime is coming sometime in the future, and after learning a bit about its voice cast a few weeks back and Shadow being revealed during the Sonic anniversary stream the other day, we thought we'd seen the last of the animated show for now. The streaming titan had other plans, of course, with the debut of a brand new clip, which confirmed one of my favorite friends of the speedy hedgehog.\n🦔💙meet Big the Cat and Froggy🦔💙\n#GeekedWeek pic.twitter.com/997Gq03S5e\nJune 10, 2022\nIn the embedded tweet above, you can watch the 30-second trailer where none other than Big the Cat from Sonic Adventure and his best friend Froggy are introduced. Sonic spins the iconic (yes, I said iconic) duo as he dashes through the Mobius environment...and then they go their separate ways so Sonic can save some of their friends. It was yet another all-too-quick look at the series that's starting to shape up more in my eyes as the supporting cast is revealed. When will we see Charmy Bee and the rest of the Chaotix? Where will Nack the Weasel make his appearance? My hope is they'll show up eventually.\nSonic Prime is still in the \"coming soon\" camp of releases at Netflix but will be exclusively available on that platform when it releases.",

Today, during the Netflix Geeked livestream, we got our first look at a successor series called Castlevania: Nocturne. Set hundreds of years after the original series, Richter Belmont takes up the whip and will continue the fight of his ancestors. Richter is the protagonist of the 1993 video game, Castlevania Rondo of Blood (also known as Dracula X). He is also of the same bloodline as the Sypha and Trevor from Netflix's first series.\nNocturne is executive produced by Kevin Kolde, with Sam Deats in the director's chair with assistant director Adam Deats. In the show, Richter will be searching for vampires in 1792 in the midst of the French Revolution. He won't be alone in his journey: Maria Renard is also along for this dark ride.\nAre you a fan of Netflix's Castlevania work? If so, what do you hope to see from this sequel series and a Belmont rising?",

In the turn-based strategy title, you explore dreams and memories, and it was referred to by Geoff Keighley on Netflix's Geeked Week stream as \"a mix between Into the Breach, Hades, Inception, and dodgeball.\" That's not your everyday video game description.\nThe art style will look memorable to anyone who has played the developer's previous games and its debut trailer feels very atmospheric, which you can watch above.  The main character discusses their vivid dreams and memories and people she's been struggling to return to, alluding to words left unsaid that stand in her way.

Today, on Netflix's Geeked Week stream, it revealed a new game called Lucky Luna for iOS and Android, which will appear later this summer on Netflix's streaming service. The game is free for all Netflix subscribers. \nLucky Luna features entirely pixel art and is a vertically scrolling, platformer dungeon crawler. The big catch? You have no jump button to get around. Players swipe left and right to guide Luna through trap-filled dungeons with hidden secrets and alternate paths.\nEvery level presents a different environment and new mechanics that allow players to explore in a new way. In the story mode, your main goal is to collect as many pearls as possible to advance to the next stage.  You'll also find new clues and light story elements to learn more about Luna's past and discover her purpose.\nLucky Luna will also support an endless mode with procedurally generated runs for every environment. This is where you can make a name for yourself on the leaderboards. Your score is based on your speed, collected peals, and the number of floors you've descended. Gather enough treasure from your runs and you unlock additional endless dungeons to keep the run going. \nLucky Luna debuts later this summer.",

As for what to expect, the answer is simple: Final Fantasy VII. This could be a stream specifically about the original release, which hit store shelves 25 years ago. But, as any Final Fantasy fan knows (and if you’re like me, hopes), we might hear about Final Fantasy VII Remake, or rather, its sequel. \nJoin us next week for around 10 minutes to celebrate 25 years of @FinalFantasy VII: https://t.co/y074ldZMhg\n#FFVII25th. Please be excited. pic.twitter.com/DskOd2CxQj\nJune 10, 2022\nHere’s what Final Fantasy VII Remake director Tetsuya Nomura says about the stream: \nPerhaps I’m reading too much into this but let’s put some pieces together: Nomura directed Final Fantasy VII Remake. This is a stream celebrating Final Fantasy VII. Players want to hear about the sequel to Final Fantasy VII Remake. Nomura specifically says “unveiling.” What could Nomura unveil? I’m betting the sequel to Final Fantasy VII Remake. Of course, the company could just reveal some new Final Fantasy VII merch or even more about the upcoming Final Fantasy VII: Ever Crisis, a mobile take on the beloved game, so it’s best to keep your expectations in check. Only time will tell for now, though. \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer’s Final Fantasy VII Remake review, and then check out this story about Nomura promising “even more new FFVII projects” in the future. \nAre you excited about this broadcast? Let us know in the comments below!",

Check it out: \n\n\nFor the uninitiated, Skate Story has been floating around for a while. Since 2020, developer Sam Eng has been slowly revealing the game on their own personal Twitter and the official Skate Story account. For the most part, these have been small gameplay videos. But today's trailer finally gives us a peek at the game's story – or at least its general premise. That being, per the trailer, \"You are a demon made of glass and pain and yet you must skate.\" What more could you need? More than that, we got extended looks at gameplay, including the unique art style. The camera angle and shake also look about as close to a real skate video as any video game's gotten thus far.\nI don't mean to gush over a game I haven't played yet, but I can't wait to get my hands on Skate Story. Luckily, it's expected to come out on PC next year.",

          "description": "Today’s Summer Game Fest presentation brought several small but important details coming to The Last of Us universe, including some details about what is now a standalone multiplayer title set within the post-apocalyptic setting.\nOriginally, a multiplayer component was planned for inclusion in the release of The Last of Us Part 2. But before that game released, Naughty Dog opted to cut that portion of the game and instead focus on the campaign. At the time, it was also clear that the multiplayer experience was likely still in the works, and was expanding in scope. Today’s reveal makes clear that expansion has broadened out to be its own full game.\nThe game has been in the works for roughly two years as of now. It includes a new cast of characters, though many of the tools those characters are using seem to be similar to those we saw in the campaign of The Last of Us Part 2; the characters wield rifles and Molotov cocktails even as chaos unfolds on the overgrown streets below them.\nNaughty Dog’s Neil Druckmann was open in admitting that they would not be sharing extensive details on the project at this time, but did share a piece of concept art that showed survivors overlooking what appears to be the city of San Francisco.\nWe still have something of a wait before we’ll be able to play the game, as Druckmann implied we’d be seeing more of the project sometime next year in 2023.\nEarlier today, a leak helped confirm that The Last of Us Remake is on the way, and today's Summer Game Fest also confirmed that progress is continuing with The Last of Us TV show, starring Bella Ramsey and Pedro Pascal, as well as news that the game's vocal stars, Ashley Johnson and Troy Baker, would be taking on some meaningful roles in the TV project.",

Prior to this, we’d only seen the characters from behind.

This lengthy look showed off traversal, combat, and a brief taste of what we could expect from the upgrade system. At today's Summer Game Fest, a new trailer debuted, giving us a deeper look at Nightwing's gameplay.\nWith Batman supposedly dead, Nightwing, Robin, Batgirl, and Red Hood have banded together to keep Gotham's streets safe. Nightwing was long an understudy of Batman and also trained as a trapeze artist as a child.  In the new footage, we see both of these influences in his fighting style. He's brutal at close range, can create distance with his acrobatic flexibility, and has gadgets galore at his disposal.\nIn most of the gameplay, he's in his traditional black and blue garb, but we also get a brief look at him in a different ninja-like suit, which you'll be able to craft by gathering specific components.\nGotham Knights is slated to release on PlayStation and Xbox consoles and also PC. I hope it lives up the Arkham series' legacy, but also hope the inclusion of cooperative play gives it a new identity that is every bit as enthralling.",

          "description": "After an announcement in April, today’s Summer Game Fest presentation gave us a more in-depth look at American Arcadia, the new game from Out of the Blue Games, the makers of Call of the Sea.\nPlayers control Trevor Hills, a resident of a strange city call Arcadia, a seemingly futuristic utopia (rooted in 1970s design sensibility) in which everything looks clean and progressive. However, the city’s pristine appearance is an illusion, as the entire thing is a reality TV show for people to watch from the outside, in which one’s popularity can tank and put your actual life at risk.\nTrevor is on the run from the constant surveillance, leading to what looks like a number of frantic chase scenes. In some, he’s being watched by floating drones that are tracking and recording his movements. In another sequence, we see Trevor desperately trying to stay ahead of police or security that are trying to take him in. And in yet another gameplay moment, he makes a death-defying leap from a high platform dive into a pool far below.\nAs the trailer wraps up, the story pans out to someone apparently outside of Arcadia, looking at the domed city from its exterior, vowing to help get him out of there. In actuality, this brief sequence is representative of the other main pillar of gameplay, in which you control a 3D first-person experience that includes hacking and puzzles. \nAmerican Arcadia clearly draws more than just a little bit of inspiration from the classic film, The Truman Show. But the added 1970s aesthetic and focus on man-on-the-run action gives it a unique vibe. And satirizing or commenting on the questionable values of reality TV certainly feels like a timely subject.\nPublished by Raw Fury, American Arcadia is heading to console and PCs at a yet-to-be announced future date.

At Summer Game Fest, One Piece Odyssey, ILCA's upcoming JRPG featuring the Straw Hat Crew, had a debut trailer introducing the cast and showing off some of the environments players can expect to explore. \nThe trailer, which you can watch above, gives each confirmed Straw Hat a spotlight as their ship, the Thousand Sunny, rockets into the sky. They're up there because of a strange cloud that forms above the seas while a Knock Up Stream kicks the ship into the air before one of Franky's Coup De Burst propels them even closer to danger. Luffy, Zoro, Nami, Sanji, Chopper, Franky, Robin, Brook, and Franky are all here, although new-ish-comer Jinbei is unfortunately nowhere to be seen. \nAs for in-game footage, we see some exploration of the world, and you can control more of the cast than just Monkey D. Luffy, so if you're a big Zorro, Sanji, or Chopper fan, you'll get to take direct control of them at some point. \nOne Piece Odyssey doesn't have a release date yet, but it is coming this year, according to the new trailer.

You should check it out, if only because it's a fun concept.\nThe big draw is its rhythm-based gameplay. While rhythm games are a dime a dozen, Hellsinger sets itself apart by being a first-person shooter, where, as you may have guessed, action has to be performed on the beat. Shooting, dodging, reloading, and so on need to be performed in time with the game's soundtrack for maximum points. \n\n\nSpeaking of the soundtrack, Hellsinger features System of a Down's Serj Tankian, Trivium's Matt Heafy, Lamb of God's Randy Blythe, and more. Check out our in-depth interview with Tankian to hear more about his contributions to the game. \nA demo for Metal: Hellsigner is available now on PlayStation, Xbox, and Steam.",

Not only does it have a new update for the PC version and some recent DLC, but a console version of the 4X game is also coming on November 4. The footage above shows a short clip of the console version in action, but I'm sure we'll see more of how Humankind is transitioning to controllers in the months ahead.\nA new PC DLC available now is titled \"Cultures Of Latin America,\" which, I'm sure you've guessed, adds new cultures, narrative events, and more based on Latin America. It costs $8.99 to add a Latin heritage to your Humankind civilizations. Here's a handy bullet-pointed list of features for this new content drop: \n6 New Cultures: Caralans, Nazca, Taíno, Inca, Argentinians, and Cubans\n6 New Wonders: Pyramid of the Sun – Teotihuacan, Maracana Stadium, Salar de Uyuni, Salto Angel, Lençóis Maranhenses, and the Atacama Desert.\n9 Independent Peoples\n15 Narrative Events\n30+ New in-game themed music tracks composed by Arnaud Roy\nBut that's not all. Amplitude is releasing a \"major update\" for the PC version of Humankind today, which also implements a reworked surrender system, rebalances war support modifiers, gives infrastructure yield previews, and adds unique wonder effects. There's even more in the update, so if you're a Humankind fan, you have plenty to check out in the game starting today.",

That’s because it was riffing off of the Dead Island 2 trailer released many years ago.

The debut trailer, which you can watch above, debuted at Summer Game Fest this afternoon.\nTim Morten, production director and CEO of Frost Giant Studios, joined Summer Game Fest host Geoff Keigley on stage to reveal a little about the new Strategy title. He describes the titular Stormgates as portals that open during solar storms that unleash the Infernal Host onto a future Earth. The trailer showed a taste of both the demonic-looking Infernal Host faction, along with the second announced race, the Human Resistance, which is represented in the footage by the archeologist, and possibly the cool-looking mech. More factions will be revealed in the future, but those were the only two Morten would confirm during today's reveal.\nMorten says Stormgate is built for approachability and is set to be free to play but won't have any pay to win transactions or NFTs. Its also going to be designed for more social interaction. Stormgate's campaign can be played cooperatively. It'll also have 3-player \"open-ended co-op\" and support for 3v3 PvP battles, along with 1v1 for those who want a more personal galactic struggle.\nStormgate will be entering beta in 2023, and interested players can sign up on the game's website for the chance to participate in the test.",

We got our hands on the Boss Factory early and had some fun concocting our ideal crimelord.\n\n\nIn this edition of New Gameplay Today, your hosts, Alex Stadnik, Jill Grodt, and John Carson, put the Boss Factory through its paces, creating something truly monstrous in the process. We hope you like demonic eyes and the slickest, oiliest skin that only a dip in a vat of olive oil could produce. Everything from skull shaping to gradient hair coloring, limb prosthetics, makeup, and scars are on the table; it's really an impressive toolset for players to mess with. Because there's so much to customize, this is an extended NGT, so sit back and enjoy the mayhem you can unleash before even stepping into the dangerous streets of Santo Ileso.\nFor more on the full breadth of customizations available in Saints Row, including vehicles and weapons, check out our preview on the topic. We also saw a newer build of the game in recent weeks, showing the game's promising additions since it was delayed in February.

          "description": "Last week’s Sony State of Play gave us a first look at gameplay for the highly anticipated Street Fighter 6. Today’s Summer Game Fest presentation opened with a second glimpse at the game, this time to add another fighter to the roster. Guile has entered the fight.\nThe news should surprise precisely no one, as Guile has been a fixture of the popular fighting game franchise for decades. However, it’s always fun to see the ways that Capcom is updating their most familiar warriors for a new outing, and the new trailer gave us a look at the well-coifed martial artist.\nGuile has always had ties to American culture and military elements, and that backdrop continues in the next installment. We see Guile fighting against a background environment very reminiscent of his early appearances, with a jet in the background, and the towering structure of what looks to be an aircraft carrier in the distance. Sailors and dock workers appear to gather and cheer on the fight.\nLike in the first-look trailer we saw last week, Guile’s moves feature some of the same flashy painterly effects that we first saw with characters like Ryu and Chun-Li. Those bright and colorful effects are a fun contrast to the new more realistic styling of characters provided through the use of the RE engine, the same engine used to craft games like Devil May Cry 6, Monster Hunter Rise, and Resident Evil Village.\nStreet Fighter 6 was confirmed earlier this week to be the farthest along in the series timeline, set after the events of Street Fighter 3. As such, this new look at Guile reflects a slightly older look for the character, but don’t worry; he still takes time before his trailer concludes to whip out a comb and fix his perfectly maintained hair.\nStreet Fighter 6 is aiming for launch on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, and Steam sometime in 2023. Check out the full new trailer below.",

However, host Geoff Keighly surprised viewers with one stellar game long-since thought lost to the development void: Routine. \nFrom Lunar Software and Raw Fury, the first-person horror all about exploring an abandoned moon base, took the stage with an unsettling new trailer. With desolate lunarscapes, dilapidated empty hallways, and a grainy, filmic vibe, the game’s latest look was set to ratchet up the tension. Its nightmarish death-dealing robot makes it stand out from the rest of the showcase’s intergalactic titles, but the short clip gives little detail on what to expect or if the game’s direction has changed significantly since we last saw it. However, we do know that composer Mick Gordon, known for his work on the Wolfenstein and Doom series, is creating its musical score. \n\n\nHowever, the team behind the game has already posted a message to players on their website about Routine’s long disappearance.

          "description": "Tindalos Interactive and publisher Focus Entertainment have revealed Aliens: Dark Descent, which appears to be a tactical shooter of sorts, and it's coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC next year. \nRevealed during today's Summer Game Fest showcase, Aliens: Dark Descent is about a squad of marines trekking through a now-destroyed spacecraft on the search for an offline relay. Their goal was simple: get the relay back online, but upon entering the craft, they find it's in ruins thanks to some Xenomorphs. And not just one Xenomorph, but multiple. It's coming to consoles and PC sometime in 2023. \nYou can check out the reveal trailer below: \n\n\nThe trailer mainly was CG and featured a squad of just a few marines, but right at the end, it appeared that some gameplay footage began to play. This gameplay looked like XCOM or The Ascent in that it featured an isometric viewpoint with enemies rushing the soldiers across the screen. It looked great, but because it was just a snippet of gameplay, it's hard to tell exactly what to expect in Aliens: Dark Descent. Focus Entertainment describes it as an \"enthralling single-player squad-based action game set within the iconic Aliens franchise\" with \"real-time combat.\" \nHere's some additional information from Focus Entertainment: \nFocus Entertainment says players will command a squad as one unit thanks to intuitive controls, allowing Marines to automatically prioritize and execute \"complex actions in real-time, based on their respective skill sets and the environment around them.\" Players must leverage the surrounding environment to their advantage to seal off checkpoints, unlock shortcuts, and create safe zones.\nAliens: Dark Descent will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC in 2023. \nAre you excited for Aliens: Dark Descent?

          "description": "Among Us VR was announced last December during the Game Awards. We got a very brief glimpse of the playable space map, The Skeld, and that’s about it. Today, during the Upload VR showcase at Summer Game Fest, a hilarious gameplay trailer premiered and revealed the release period for Innersloth’s popular party game. You can watch the footage below. \n\n\nIn the trailer, crewmates discuss the imposter’s identity in the Cafeteria, using their hands to emote in increasingly ridiculous ways. Like in the original game, players run around the various facilities of the arena, completing small minigames to repair or organize the scattered points of interest. The change to 3D suits the loop well and adds to the tension; there will probably be plenty of jumpscares to go around. \nLike many of you, we loved the original game, scoring it an 8.5 out of 10: \n“Among Us released over two years ago, but the jellybean/astronaut online game is currently seeing a massive surge in popularity that began in early September. The world may have started out quarantine by playing Animal Crossing: New Horizons, a wholesome game about friendship and taking care of our islands, but after many months of pandemic life, we’re hungry for the void of space filled with chaos and deceit.”\nAmong Us VR launches on Meta Quest 2 and Steam VR this Holiday season.",

As you might expect, it looks gorgeous. The remake will also include the entire game and the Left Behind DLC. Plus, it's also in development for PC, but it doesn't seem like the PC release will be happening simultaneously with the PS5 release. \nYou can check out the trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nThe pre-order page reveals the standard PS5 edition will cost $69.99, while the special Firefly Edition will cost $99.99. It's unclear what the Firefly Edition will contain, as the page linked to it in Wario64's tweet no longer takes you to The Last Of Us Part 1. \nHere's a blurb of the game Wario64 caught on the listing: \nAnd here are some shots of the listing, as well as in-game screenshots, from Wario64: \n\nIt's unclear what exactly happened here – perhaps this was set to be revealed during today's Summer Game Fest showcase, or maybe Sony had other plans and accidentally hit the \"go live\" button on its website.

However, that’s not all the company had to reveal today. \nIn a new Xbox Wire blog post, Microsoft discusses Project Moorcroft, which is seemingly its take on the PlayStation Plus Game Trials system launching with the revamped service on June 13. According to the blog post, the program will bring “the fun and discovery of playing new, curated demos of upcoming games to our Xbox Game Pass members,” and it will begin rolling out next year. It will start with “a focus on providing independent developers from around the world more opportunities to build excitement for their games.” \nXbox says participating developers will be able to see how their demos perform, and the company will compensate them too, “enabling them to bring their creativity to Xbox and reach new audiences with Game Pass.” Xbox also says that later this year, “it’s our intent to roll out the ability for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members to play, from the cloud, select games they already own or have purchased outside the Xbox Game Pass library.” \nElsewhere in the blog post, Microsoft has revealed new colors for Xbox Design Lab. They include Soft Pink, Soft Orange, Soft Green, and Soft Purple. There are new Camo Top cases with matching side caps, too, including Mineral Camo, Arctic Camo, Forest Camo, Sandglow Camo, and Blaze Camo. Xbox Design Lab is launching in 11 new countries, including Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Norway, Slovakia, and Switzerland. Xbox Design Lab will come to Taiwan later this summer. \nFor more, read about how Xbox is bringing the Game Pass library to select Samsung Smart TVs later this month. \nAre you excited about these demos?

The listing was posted to Reddit, where it gained traction. You can see the image of the crossover below. \nThis wouldn’t be the first time the two car-racing giants joined forces. Hot Wheels DLC packages sped onto the scenic tracks of Forza Motorsport 5 and Forza Horizon 3 and 4. What Playground Games has in store with its latest arcade racing simulator is anyone’s guess. \nForza Horizon 5 cracked Game Informer’s Top 10 Games of 2021 list: \n“To merely say Forza Horizon 5 is among the most mechanically sound racing games ever created would be a disservice and overlook what makes the game worthy of praise. Yes, the foundational act of driving feels fantastic, but it’s the rest of the package that truly elevates this fifth entry in the series to the rarified air that demands a place on our list of the top 10 games of the year.”\nAre you excited about the alleged crossover?\n[Source: Eurogamer]",

          "description": "Sony officially announced three TV shows last month – a God of War series at Amazon, a Gran Turismo show, and a Horizon series coming to Netflix – and these three joined the already-in-production Twisted Metal TV series. The latter has received plenty of updates, such as word that Anthony Mackie will star and Will Arnett will voice Sweet Tooth. Details about these other shows, though, have remained unknown. \nHowever, new details about Netflix’s Horizon show have reportedly leaked, including that it will be called Horizon 2074. This news comes from GamesBeat’s Jeff Grubb, as reported by Eurogamer. Grubb said Horizon 2074 will be “split between the timeline you see in the games and the timeline of where things begin to fall.” \n\n\nHe also said the idea is that the series will not be “a reboot or remake or reimagining of the game’s storyline” but will instead “take place parallel and explain other elements that happen,” according to Eurogamer. \nIf Grubb’s leaked details end up being true – mind you, this show sounds very early in production, so some things could change as well – then it sounds like we’ll be getting a lot of backstory and lore related to the fall of humanity. We might also learn how Earth gets to where it is at the start of Horizon Zero Dawn. Only time will tell for now. \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer’s Horizon Zero Dawn review and check out our thoughts on Horizon Forbidden West.

This quirky game features the protagonist Chewy as he tries to outwit the evil Borks. Escaping from their high security zone, F5, will just be the start of his adventure.\nIf any of you have the game and are willing to test it out, we'll welcome any feedback. You will need a daily development build. As always, please submit the bug reports to our issue tracker. \nPlease note that the ScummVM version does have one major outstanding issue: the music used by the game is in a custom format we've been unable to properly support yet.

          "description": "A few days ago, Google announced the list of students accepted for this year's Google Summer of Code.\nWe are very proud to welcome 4 students this year who will be working on various parts of the project during the upcoming months.\nPragyansh Chaturvedi (aka Raikou) will work on improving our DIRECTOR engine. His effort will help us to allow support for many 90s-era adventure games made with the Macromedia Director authoring tools. By implementing more internal functions used by DIRECTOR, Pragyansh's main objective is to extend support for Meet Mediaband and The Journeyman Project (Win and Mac), making them fully playable without any glitches.\nMichael Hayman (aka Quote58) is about to implement support for The Immortal. The game (released in 1990) can be described as a mix of genres involving RPG elements with action and puzzles. Many changes across different game variants (written in pure assembly code!) will make this an interesting challenge. This project is a continuation of a GSoC task initially started by a former student back in 2018.\nEmanuele Grisenti (aka grisenti) will be working on a new engine, HPL1. The original sources for this engine got recently released by the original developer Frictional Games under GPLv3. The purpose of this project is to achieve a full port of this engine to ScummVM, with the goal of supporting the 2007 survival game Penumbra: Overture.\nAvijeet Maurya (aka StableSteady) will pick up several incomplete engines: MacVenture, Avalanche, Glk-Scott, Pink and WAGE. Some of these engines are very close to completion, but not quite there yet. The main objective of Avijeet's task is to identify all missing features and fix existing bugs. The goal for his project is to bring the above engines to a stable state.\nThe team is very excited about the upcoming weeks – and we hope you are as well.\nPlease give a warm welcome to our new students! Let's make GSoC 2022 a huge success – together!\n>",
