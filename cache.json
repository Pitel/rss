          "description": "This game has a monkey in a lab coat.\n'Cyberpunk' has become a bit of a dirty word in games as of late after a certain game's widely-publicised rough launch. However, video games and the cyberpunk aesthetic have gone hand in hand for almost as long as the medium has existed. From SNES-era titles like Shadowrun and Hideo Kojima’s wildly underappreciated Snatcher and Policenauts; to the present where we find games like Astral Chain, VA-11 HALL-A, and — yes — Cyberpunk 2077. In fact, it's so common in games that it becomes harder and harder to be wow-ed by the aesthetic. Despite this, ANNO: Mutationem pulled us in right away.\nANNO (no relation to the popular city building simulator of the same name) is an action-RPG that comes courtesy of indie developer ThinkingStars in conjunction with Sony’s China Hero Project. After launching on Playstation platforms and PC in March, it makes its way to Nintendo’s hybrid with a near-flawless conversion, only let down by some long load times and the occasional frame rate dip.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "\"Nooo! Don't gooo!\".\nCast your mind back to 1996, you might remember the now-iconic opening cinematic for Capcom's Resident Evil, featuring the in-game S.T.A.R.S team in a live-action shoot (for Nintendo gamers specficially, you might have first encountered the cinematic in the 2006 DS release, Resident Evil: Deadly Silence). Even in the mid-'90s, it was considered to be pretty cheesy, but its inclusion has been cited by Resident Evil fans as one of their favourite aspects of the original game in more recent years.\nNow, after 26 years, three of the cast members have reunited to promote a fan project from YouTube channel Residence of Evil. As reported by Time Extension, Charles Kraslavsky (Chris Redfield), Greg Smith (Barry Burton), and Eric Pirius (Albert Wesker (he still looks like him!)) sit down with host and filmmaker Andrew Saullo to talk about their experiences shooting the cinematic, whether they remained in contact with one another in the years since, and how they became involved with Residence of Evil's fan project called 'The Keeper: A Biohazard Story'.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

And amidst Konami's line-up — which includes multiple Yu-Gi-Oh! games, Super Bomberman R 2, and Coffee Talk Episode 2 — is the surprise return of a forgotten classic — Cannon Dancer.\nKnown as Osman in Japan, the game was created by Kouichi \"Isuke\" Yotsui, who worked as a designer on Capcom classic Strider. Our friends over at Time Extension spotted the game in a listing shared by Twitter user @ohfivepro. What makes this so special? Well, Cannon Dancer was an arcade exclusive back in 1996, and Isuke considered it \"his\" sequel to the classic side-scrolling action game. So this is the very first time we're getting this game on home consoles.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Meet the \"Playboy\"... No, not that one.\nBritish video game developer Rare is undoubtedly best known for its close relationship with Nintendo back in the '90s and early '00s, before Microsoft outright acquired it in 2002. Indeed, games like GoldenEye 007, Banjo-Kazooie, and Perfect Dark have all cemented themselves as icons in the industry; games that have not only stood the test of time in their own right, but also directly influenced a good deal of the titles you play to this day.\nIn the late '80s, however, Rare embarked on a decidedly different venture; one that ultimately never came to fruition. As reported by our friends over at Time Extension, before Nintendo's Game Boy system was announced and released, Rare's co-founder Chris Stamper worked on a hardware project known as the RAZZ arcade board which used a Zilog Z80 processor and could apparently display thousands of on-screen colours - certainly more than Nintendo's own Game Boy could manage. This board would then be utilised in a handheld device that Rare christened the 'Playboy', with much of the exterior design handled by the company's other co-founder, Tim Stamper.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Pixel Noir, a turn-based RPG that mixes investigative crime with classic RPG elements, is coming to Switch in April next year.\nThe game has been in Steam's Early Access since 2019 and has captured the interest of many with its isometric viewpoint and different take on the JRPG story. Instead of playing as some plucky young teenagers out to save the world, you're a grizzly detective — the city's cheapest, even! Not a story about the power of friendship, then. Now, publisher BadLand has announced that the game will be leaving Early Access next spring.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "First batch now on sale.\nThe Nintendo Switch has proven to be groundbreaking on a number of levels, but, as with many consoles, accessibility has continued to be one of the main features on which it can improve. A 2017 console evaluation by The Able Gamers Charity confirmed just this, commenting on the Switch's 'zero accessibility features' at launch. Since then, Nintendo introduced system-level button remapping and the ability to zoom, but there's still much more that could be done, and YouTuber Akaki Kuumeri has created a Joy-Con adaptor to begin moving these problems in the opposite direction.\nKuumeri's design (shown in the video above) works to combat certain dexterity issues some gamers experience as a result of the console's traditional two-handed approach to gaming. Flipping one Joy-Con into an upside-down position, the adaptor lets you play the console's two-handed control system from the button inputs of a single controller.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Everything, it turns out.\nBack in the days of the N64, developers were still trying to figure out just how to wrap their heads around the world of 3D gaming, even Nintendo itself. With The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, we were treated to visuals the likes of which had yet been seen, including the vast landscape of Hyrule Field, the stunningly realised towns and dungeons, and of course, the intriguing day and night cycle depicted in the sky above.\nIt turns out, however, that the sky itself is one big optical illusion, achieved by creating a small rotating cube that nestles within the camera's viewpoint, giving the impression of enclosing the entire map within its borders. You'll likely already know this, of course, since the very nature of a 'skybox' is to effectively enclose a game's landscape within its borders, but seeing the feature in practice via the below video is frankly kind of mind-blowing.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Rural traditions are fun if you're part of them, but to outsiders they can be unsettling at best. \nThis is relevant to my thinking about Saturnalia, an upcoming survival horror game by Italian studio Santa Ragione, where a small group of outsiders try to escape a village on the night of an ancient ritual. I've been playing a preview build of Saturnalia for the last week or so, and also got to talk about it with the studio director Pietro Righi Riva. \"I usually tell people, 'Oh, you should make a game in like six months', and I have tried to do that in the past,\" he tells me. \"This one just kind of got out of hand. I found an email yesterday, as I was looking for finishing the credits, about me discussing some story items in April 2017.\" And, while I am sure that most developers don't wish they'd been making a video game in the middle of the pandemic, I think the extra time may have allowed Santa Ragione to make something excellent.\nRead more",

In Stranded, as I saw from a hands-off preview at Gamescom 2022, you’re certainly not planetside by choice, having crash-landed on an uncharted world with just four surviving astronauts left to scavenge, hunt and build their way towards something resembling a life.\r\n\n\r\n“Like RimWorld”, I thought to myself upon hearing the pre-demo pitch, and subsequently wrote in my notes four separate times before ceasing to bother. If only mere words could convey just how much “like RimWorld” Stranded: Alien Dawn is – other 3D-ified clones exist, like last year’s Going Medieval, but here, even the exact spaceship-wrecking premise matches that of Ludeon Studios' seminal survival sim. \r\n\n \nRead more",

Unlike other monitors of this magnitude, it can also rotate into portrait mode, leaving the top curve towering over you like an unsympathetic Victorian headmaster. \r\n\n\r\nI actually enjoy a touch of design madness creeping into the occasional piece of PC gear, regardless of whether it can hang with the best gaming monitors that sensible people might buy.

I'm a fundamentally un-grand person; I spend most days dressed like a 14-year-old fan of Tony Hawk, I do not like olives or scallops, and I'm unable to predict the consequences of actions if they exist outside of, say, a 12 month timeframe. A game like Victoria 3, where the whole point is making decisions that have country-wide effects and outcomes years in the future, is essentially operating in a different language to any I understand.\nI'm trying to learn new languages, though, so it's not an unwelcome challenge. The problem is that previewing Victoria 3 is quite an advanced level to dive in, the Paradox GSG equivalent of being a live translator for a UN summit when you're only just about able to read the French version of The Famous Five. In a presentation before I and others were let loose on the better part of a week with the game, it was claimed that Victoria 3 is the best yet for onboarding newcomers, with a deep and detailed tutorial system. And to that I say: kinda. Luckily, the AI in Victoria 3 is so advanced it's better at playing the game than I am.\nRead more",

Bouncing between appointments in this sea of booths and lanyards was jarring, but I'd eventually settle in after a few minutes of reconfiguring my brain to whatever presentation or control scheme was placed in front of me. Hyenas never gave me a chance.\nI sat in a 20-minute presentation of the game and tried my level best to understand SEGA's stab at a live-service FPS. Instead, I exited the booth with whiplash... and a sense of curiosity. Somewhere inside the game's insufferable tone is a kernel of cleverness, I just need to get my mitts on it to confirm my suspicions. Otherwise, it's very difficult to really understand whether it can survive in such a saturated space.\nRead more",

This latest rumination on voyeurism also delves into storytelling, sex, death, religion, love, lust, lies, pretence (as distinct from acting), power and self. That's a lot to pack into the partial, out of order clips of three different films, which manage to span both decades and careers. The central figure is Marissa Marcel, an almost-star actor who made three movies before disappearing. So the question you strive to answer, by looking through unedited takes and rehearsal footage, is: what happened to Marissa Marcel?\nIn typical Barlow fashion, the entirety of the footage isn't easily spooled through. From one starting clip you're able to watch it, flick back and forth through the recording, and pause it to use the in-game search tool to focus on a face or object on screen. Selecting it will then take you to that face or a similar object in a different clip, and eventually you build up a much fuller catalogue of footage.\nNow. Immortality also talks quite a bit about sex, in various ways and for various reasons, and there is female nudity. So yes, you can enhance! Zoom! on a tit. And the game will take you to another clip featuring a similar tit. Ba-dum, tsh!\nRead more",

It launched at £125 for a 1TB size earlier this year, but now it's down to £84 where it's rather more fetching. The 2TB size has also been reduced and is even better value at £152. Here's why we rate these SSDs - and where to find them at the lowest price.\nLet's do the 'where to find them' bit first. It's quite simple: WD's UK store is offering the 1TB at the best price right now, while Ebuyer is the place to go if you'd prefer the larger 2TB model. \nRead more",

Tuesday's Opening Night Live showcase featured a huge amount of trailers to gawk at, a baggage carousel of content that moved at a blistering clip. Despite its two hour runtime a lot of interesting (and in most cases, new) titles weren't given a huge amount space to breathe, their moment in the spotlight frequently cut short by another trailer waiting impatiently in the wings.\r\n\n\r\nYou'd be forgiven, then, for missing a few bits and pieces because you were blinking really fast or distracted by the cat eating something unknown underneath your coffee table. Not to worry though, as I've once again gathered team RPS to tell me in detail about the games that caught their attention during Geoffcom 2022.\r\n\n\r\nMuch like our E3 roundup from earlier in the summer, each RPS staffer took ten minutes out of their day to wax lyrical about an upcoming project featured within the showcase. All eight (including yours truly, who thanks to Katharine actually remembered to contribute this time around) chose completely different games. Some picks are more obvious, whereas others are a little off piste. In a good way, of course!\r\n \nRead more",

Since then, development changed hands like a baton at the Olympic relay; Yager left a year later, to be replaced by Sumo Digital, only for Sumo Digital to leave and be replaced by Dambuster Studios. Usain Bolt hasn't expressed interest yet, but there's time.\nSo going into a 20-minute hands-on with the game in the year 2022, I was a bit apprehensive. What sort of Frankenstinian horror awaited me behind closed doors? But, far from a shambling mess, what I played was a zombie 'em up that seemed close to what Graham saw in 2014, only polished up to a surprising, bloody gloss.\nRead more",

          "description": "Not that all the other wars were just a bit of goofing around, but World War One – a conflict remembered more for its bleak, arduous trench warfare than any great triumph over evil – seems like a particularly unusual source of inspiration for a strategy game that will, presumably, be played for fun. Nonetheless, The Great War: Western Front, a combination of macro planning and tactical RTS battling revealed this week at Gamescom, has elected to lean right into WW1’s complexities and difficulties rather than dance around them.\n\r\nDevelopers Petroglyph have gone for historical accuracy in various ways, senior designer Chris Becker and audio director Frank Klepacki explain to me at a hands-off demo in Cologne. The soundtrack will even include licensed music from the era. But something they want to really hammer home is the brutality of the war: territory won’t be won in heroic pushes but slowly and bloodily, while collapsing morale is as much a danger as any advancing army.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Nostalgic yet unknown is perhaps a good way to describe OU upon first glance. It’s a game clearly designed to mimic the picture book imagination of childhood with its hand-drawn visuals and the innocent silent presence of its protagonist, a young boy named OU and his opossum friend. Even its music is reminiscent of some lost, unknown childhood as we’re lulled into the strange world of U-Chronia with the smooth instrumentation of a single guitar and its occasional percussion. Yet it’s clear with the presence of beasts that threaten your safety and a shadowy clone that this isn’t some peaceful retreat into childhood.\nRead more",

Not Age Of Empires II this time, though. \nBecause there's no Matthew, I change the Cavern Of Lies into a cavern of moral judgement for Nate, and make him run a gauntlet of some of the most important choices in Dragon Age Inquisition with no context.

          "description": "\"The thing we're doing with The Dark Pictures is exploring different sub genres of horror,\" explains game director Tom Heaton. The Dark Pictures Anthology is, well, a horror anthology, each a compact standalone scary game where you explore and deal with QTEs and hazardous choices, in the vein of Supermassive's smash hit Until Dawn. The idea, says Heaton, is that each one takes one or two horror sub-genres and mines them, maybe subverting the tropes here and there. Up next is The Devil In Me, inspired by the infamous Chicago serial killer H. H. Holmes. \n\"What I think we decided with The Dark Pictures games early on was that the next game in the series would be very different from the last game, because we want to keep it fresh, we want to give the audience new,\" Heaton explains. So, after a zombie ghost ship in Man Of Medan, the psychological witch hauntings in Little Hope, and military squad vs. vampire aliens in House Of Ashes, Heaton pitches The Devil In Me as kind of Saw meets The Shining. It's a serial killer slasher in a weirdo hotel, and it has a true crime element. And I have to say, it's probably the most excited I've been for a Dark Pictures entry.\nRead more",

          "description": "I'm a sucker for a pretty mechanical keyboard, but usually the keebs I'm most enamoured with have price tags to match - think £100 to £200 minimum, and think the upper end of that scale if you want a keyboard that looks like a giant ice cube or weighs a solid 2.3kg. Happily though, there are also now a range of much more affordable keyboards that still include the unusual colour schemes, high-quality components and brilliant typing experiences that make mechanical keyboards so fascinating to me. One of the best makers in this space is Akko, and today a range of their best full-size and compact keyboards are on sale at Amazon UK. \nRead more",

There are people who love doing the management bits - the bean-counting, optimising the amount of salt on fries to make people thirsty and buy more drinks, paying close attention to demographics and average spends and that sort of kidney*. Then there are people who want to design a park full of cool-ass rides and different themed zones, a true magical wonderland. Inside this Park Beyond are two wolves, in other words, and each needs a different but equally robust set of tools to wrangle.\nAfter some hands on with an early build of Park Beyond, I have a little more faith that Limbic Entertainment are going to be able to pull it off. The toolset for building a rollercoast is, in particular, impressive. It's never been so easy to make a ride that breaks both the laws of physics and the laws of health and saftey. The coasters in this game are an absolute menace. In a good way.\nRead more",

Both of you occasionally interject, sometimes prompting a decision that changes the game a little as your granddad amends things to your liking. It doesn't go to the full meta-narrative lengths of a Juarez Gunslinger with it, but it's a cute touch and keeps the framing relevant.\nRead more",

          "description": "Grim Souls-like Lies Of P will be hitting PC sometime in 2023 according to a new gameplay trailer shown at Opening Night Live during this year's Gamescom. The RPG combines the story of Pinocchio with some major Bloodborne energy, as the puppet searches for a way to become a real human boy in a decimated city. This is far from the classic fairytale story though. With a dark-gothic backdrop and mechanical killer robots to contend with, Pinocchio has his work cut out for him. You can watch the new bombastic gameplay trailer below:\nRead more",

Of course, they also work for desktop computers too - and are much more portable and space-saving than an average actual desktop monitor. \nYou can even get OLED models now - and a coupon code on Amazon US brings one model down from Innocn from $350 to $200 when you tick the 'coupon' box on the product page. That's quite a bargain for a 15.6-in portable screen of this calibre. \nRead more",

There is a tiny, teeny smattering of gameplay at the end, though. Big swords, big monsters, big magic, big sand.

Dále bylo opraveno mnoho chyb v komponentách, ale i ve stávajících šablonách. Také byla povýšena podpora TimescaleDB na verzi 2.7.x.

Testovalo se na jádru Linux 6.0-rc2 v kombinaci s X Server 1.21.1.3 + Wayland a Mesa 22.3 devel, což je kombinace obsahující již poměrně slušnou podporu pro Arc, avšak už nyní víme, že do Linuxu 6.1 míří další vylepšení. Tento úvodní test tedy berme jako orientační srovnání s konkurencí.",

Nowadays, the series has expanded beyond just the games, we've also released movies, merchandise, run eSports events, and done numerous collaborations to reach a wider audience. Seeing people from all kinds of backgrounds interacting with the series in its various forms has been a momentous driving force in keeping us going as we work towards its future.\"\n\nRight now, the main purpose of the site is sharing stories, via a social system of sorts. Capcom is collecting \"comment cards,\" which are like little information squares with someone's name (or alias), an avatar, and a little blurb about themselves and their favorite aspects of the Street Fighter series. Current and former Capcom employees, including Shuhei Matsumoto and Hideaki Itsuno, have contributed.\nThe other functionality of the site includes a history lesson page, dating back to the original Street Fighter game in 1987, through 2023's Street Fighter 6. While you can't click each game to get a full breakdown, select entries do have a separate pop-up page, including Street Fighter 1, 2, Alpha, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\nThe Street Fighter 35th anniversary landing is a cute little page, and no doubt is helping in terms of easing the wait for the next iteration. After cruising through a lot of these games, I can't help but want to play them again.\nThe post There’s a Street Fighter 35th anniversary website, and it has lots of great art appeared first on Destructoid.",

It is important to note that Kadokawa Group remains the majority shareholder in FromSoftware, owning a huge 69.66% of the Dark Souls studios stock. This \"third-party allotment\" of shares has been allowed in order to bolster FromSoft's financial resources, as well as facilitate its growth in overseas territories. The deal is expected to close September 7, 2022.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOrtKh8Vv3g\n\"FromSoftware is driving the Game Business as it has continually been creating world-famous works, such as Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice and Elden Ring, leveraging its advanced game IP development strength,\" wrote Kadokawa in its officious sales document. \"With an eye on further expansion of the Game Business, the Group recognizes the enhancement of capabilities for the creation, development and deployment of game IP as one of the Group’s highest priorities. In line with this policy, the Company has decided to have FromSoftware implement fund procurement by way of a Third-Party Allotment to Sixjoy and SIE.\"\nFromSoftware is the latest studio sell-up its shares, in part or in whole, to Tencent.

If you're afraid of the ocean, maybe sit this one out.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfniX3fH1l0\nDredge is the debut title from Christchurch-based Black Salt Games and publisher Team17, who has a knack for finding projects with intriguing new concepts in familiar genres.\nThis trailer is more about establishing the serene-meets-sinister vibe of Dredge, which is fine — it serves its purpose. But if you want to see gameplay, I'd check out the Steam page for some more illuminating screenshots and gifs. The lighting is fantastic.\nYer fond of me lobster, ain't ye?\nI like the idea of roaming between islands for quests, snatching up and selling sell fish, earning enough money to upgrade the ship, and heading out into the great unknown, potentially at my own peril. The inventory system also catches my eye as a perpetual Resident Evil 4 replayer; it's going to be fun to twist and turn odd-shaped items (in this case, fish and gear) to squeeze them all into a tight space to maximize trips.\n[caption id=\"attachment_342338\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1920\"] Making room for all the fish on the ship with a bit of \"inventory Tetris.\"[/caption]\nI'm hazy on how the nighttime mechanics work — how screwed are we? — but the scenery is unnerving. (And I'm generally not one to be too put off by freaky Subnautica-sized sea creatures.) As the creators of Dredge put it, you'll be able to \"strengthen your mind and use special abilities to survive trips out on the water after dark.\"\nDredge is launching in 2023 on Nintendo Switch, PC (via Steam), PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S.

          "description": "You can also pick up its previous versions right now\nWhat's in a word, but an arrangement of letters? Factori is a neat-looking indie game that takes the alphabet and asks you to make \"soup\" and other words with it, factory-style.\nFactori essentially seems like a mash-up between words and logic, like if Zachtronics made a game about forming words. You start with just one resource, the letter i.\nFrom there you can bend, rotate, reflect, and more, eventually making more complex letters. Then you can use those complex letters to form words, optimizing chains and hunting for secret letters.\n\nThe initial version of factori was made for the 2021 Game Maker's Toolkit Game Jam, where it took home the #1 spot. Developer Star Garden Games went on to refine the free demo into a 1.0 version, which you can currently purchase on Itch.io.\nSteam-powered factori\nToday's announcement, which brought this to my attention in the first place, is that Star Garden is now planning to bring factori to Steam. And it's not just a port of the 1.0 version from Itch, either.\nAccording to Star Garden's blog, factori will hit Steam with several new features. This includes a hard mode, which has restrictions on certain buildings that can be used. A dark mode is also on the way, which is always, always a good choice.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7gvQiYYDhQ\nThere are also more secrets, some quality-of-life improvements, and more to be announced. Basically, it sounds like Star Garden is adding a little more to the factori with each new release. And if you already dug the original idea, these new twists being added seem pretty interesting.\nThere's no ETA on the Steam version of factori just yet outside of a 2023 estimation. The team has set up several social platforms, including Discord, Twitter, and a newsletter, so you can be notified on any announcements.\nThe post Factori is a neat mash-up of letters and logic coming to Steam appeared first on Destructoid.",

The Jackbox model is pretty genius, and it's one of those series I'm always going to check out every time they have a new release.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7ffJQyTC6Q\nThat's why I'm super excited to see the trailer drop for their newest release, Jackbox Party Pack 9. It's yet another excuse to have a bunch of friends over and sit down to check out the new games. There are four completely new games in this pack, as well as the return of a revamped favorite:\nQuixort, a co-op trivia sorting game where players will have to sort a series of blocks in order thanks to the help of some little robots.\nJunktopia, a storytelling game where players are turned into frogs by an evil wizard, and must earn their way back into the wizard’s good graces by giving random objects amusing backstories to increase their values.\nRoomerang, a role-playing game where players take on the role of gameshow contestants and must answer prompts and avoid elimination.\nNonsensory, a laid-back game where players write, draw, and try to guess the silly things that their friends wrote and drew.\nAnd of course Fibbage 4, the return of a classic where players must bluff and get other players to believe their false answers.\nThe new trailer that dropped today gives a nice, quick overview of what each game entails if you're looking for a summary. There are also some adorable pugs involved, which I think is only due to their being adorable. Whatever, I'm not complaining.\nJackbox Party Pack 9 will be available on Nintendo Switch, Xbox, PlayStation, and Steam, with an announcement of the release date coming soon.\nThe post The Jackbox Party Pack 9 trailer is here appeared first on Destructoid.",

He eventually becomes an edgerunner, or essentially a merc, similar to V in Cyberpunk 2077. Hopefully David's big heists go smoother than V's did.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtqIas3bYhg\nDavid winds up befriending other lost souls trying to get by in Night City, it seems.

No waiting around for each week's new episode here.\nA high-octane future\nI'd normally be a bit lukewarm on the concept of a Cyberpunk anime, seeing how 2077 didn't quite land for me or others. I've gone back since the release of the next-gen update for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, and while I dig a lot of the little improvements that have been made since launch, I'm still iffy on the overall game.\nWhat's kept me interested in this has been Studio Trigger's involvement. The animation house behind Kill la Kill and Promare has a well-regarded background in over-the-top action. And today's trailer is a mix of over-the-top action and Studio Trigger style. Edgerunners seems like it could at least make for a fun watch.\nNetflix has landed some solid animated game adaptations in the past, and Cyberpunk: Edgerunners has the benefit of drawing on both the video game and the tabletop franchise behind it. Of the many, many video game adaptations in the works, this could at least manage to be a fun, futuristic romp.\nThe post Cyberpunk: Edgerunners gets an intense new trailer and a date appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "One of the greats crosses a huge milestone\nTerraria is one of those games that has a simple premise, but it's so well executed, it's secured a spot as one of the best games of all time. I came to know it as sort of a 2D version of Minecraft (although that's something of an oversimplification), and it really gained traction in the mid-2010s when it got picked up by the Let's Play community on YouTube. Terraria is incredibly well-loved to this day, and is now one of the best-reviewed games on Steam. That's because Terraria has surpassed over a million reviews on the platforms, and while it's not the first title to do so, it is the first title with over a million reviews that has also maintained its \"overwhelmingly positive\" status.\nSpecifically, those reviews are still 97% positive, with 978,864 positive reviews and 21,444 negative ones. That lands Terraria as the second-best reviewed game on Steam of all time, after Valve's beloved classic Portal 2. However, it did manage to beat out Stardew Valley, Hades, and Left 4 Dead 2, just to name a few.\n\nLike Minecraft, Terraria's community is still going strong, and its developer Re-Logic is still producing new content for the game (as well as providing quality-of-life updates) over ten years after its release.\nThe newest update 1.4.4, called the Labor of Love update, will be released sometime in late September, and will also be the game's first simultaneous cross-platform launch for both console and PC.\nWhile I did have a brief Minecraft phase, I never did give Terraria a try, even after watching plenty of my favorite YouTubers give it a go back in the day. Based on those overwhelmingly positive reviews, however, it sounds like I have no choice but to give it a try one of these days. Another awesome game to add to the list!\nThe post Terraria has over a million reviews on Steam, and they’re still “overwhelmingly positive” appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Remember the Robots\nSquare Enix has released a new trailer for its upcoming Nintendo Switch port of NieR: Automata. The preview focuses on evocative protagonist 2B, the NieR hero who would become a legendary gaming icon.\n2B — or to offer her full moniker YoRHa No.2 Type B — is a YoRHa all-purpose battle android created to aid humanity in its war with The Machines. Adept in all manner of fighting abilities and coded to operate with cold and ruthless efficiency, 2B is one of mankind's finest tools in its efforts to reclaim the planet. As NieR fans will be fully aware, however, there is more than 2B than meets the eye, and her single-minded coldness will be put to the test on the battlefield when faced with the chaos, disaster, and \"death\" of her equally disposable friends and colleagues.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqHMMLn00ts\nWhile NieR: Automata launched as something of a cult release, PlatinumGames challenging action-RPG would find itself pushed into the mainstream, thanks in no small part to 2B's elegant, engaging, and undeniably sexy demeanor. Operating as both the heart and the brain of NieR: Automata's narrative 2B — alongside her battle buddies 9S, A2, and not forgetting Pod — offer the only real semblance of actual humanity in a bleak, miserable, and seemingly endless war of attrition.\nNieR: Automata The End of YoRHa Edition was first announced during June's Nintendo Direct. The port will feature a faithfully recreated adaptation of the 2017 modern classic, bundled with all of the RPG's post-release content which includes additional missions and character costumes. In addition to this DLC, the Switch port will feature a small range of exclusive skins for the trio of protagonists.\nNieR: Automata: End of YorHa Edition launches October 6 on Nintendo Switch. Pre-orders for the physical release are now live at the official Square Enix store.\nThe post NieR: Automata Switch trailer reacquaints us with the iconic 2B appeared first on Destructoid.",

It came screaming out of the gate with 1-2 Switch compatibility, but has since mostly trailed off. Mostly.\nI was reminded by this Reddit thread that the right Switch Joy-Con does in fact have an IR sensor; some Nintendo documents call it the \"IR motion camera.\" Now, if you haven't interacted with it in any way, that's kind of normal. The total number of games that can wield the power of the IR motion camera is a very small list, and only several of them are particularly noteworthy. While there was a time when 1-2 Switch was relevant, that time passed roughly a week after it launched. Labo sadly has similarly fallen into obscurity. As of now, the most notable games I'd cite as IR motion camera ready are Ring Fit Adventure, Resident Evil Revelations, and Brain Age Switch.\n\nBelow is a list compiled by Reddit user extremeelementz, which we've elaborated on and added to.\nGames that use the Nintendo Switch Joy-Con IR sensor:\n1/2 Switch (a sole minigame has IR compatibility)\nNintendo Labo (used for Labo creations as an optional tool, and allows it to read bits of the Labo cardboard)\nGame Builder Garage (like Labo, you can use it for creations)\nRing Fit Adventure (checks your heartrate: take that Wii Vitality Sensor)\nResident Evil Revelations (reload by covering the sensor)\nSpy Alarm (shovelware that functions as a detection kit)\nNight Vision (shovelware with basic interactions with the IR camera to showcase night vision)\nBrain Age/Dr. Kawashima’s Brain Training (some minigames can sense things like hand motions, asking you to perform the proper hand signal)\nSmile Basic 4 (programming software that utilizes IR optionally)\nNinjala (scans to unlock cosmetics)\nVitamin Connection (used to interact with a maze mechanic via distance calculations)\nThe post I forgot the right Switch Joy-Con has an IR sensor: here’s what uses it appeared first on Destructoid.",

The narrative campaign came to a close back in July, with players encouraged to use these remaining months to wind up their adventures, max out characters, and spend any remaining \"Diamantium,\" the title's in-game currency.

          "description": "The most common cheat skipped to the testing range\nWhile Nintendo is fairly lax about, well, basically everything in regards to its online system, Splatoon 3 cheaters are already facing a reckoning — before the game is out.\nWhile Splatoon 3 is due out on September 9, this past weekend Nintendo ran a \"Splatfest\" event, which allowed players to download a demo, log in, choose a side (rock, paper, or scissors), and play. But according to famed Switch dataminer OatmealDome, Splatoon 3 anti-cheat was not only present during the Splatfest, but it also started issuing console bans.\nThis impacts folks who modify the game in any way, and apparently the most popular means of this during the Splatfest was a way to enter the testing range (the lobby system that lets you practice) immediately. Essentially, this allowed folks who shared the user-created patch to skip the tutorial segment and save some time. Well, in theory, at least. Once the game actually does come out, OatmealDome also has a running total of cycled events, including Salmon Run variants, as well as regular and anarchy battle maps.\nAs far as the Splatfest itself goes, I had fun up until halftime (as team scissors). Once the 4v2v2 mode started up things got a little dicey, especially for the winning team. As the current winner you're locked out of manually queuing 4v2v2 matches, and you can \"randomly play one\" through chance by starting up the regular Splatfest queue. It was too chaotic for my tastes, and as-is, I'll probably be playing up until halftime for these events before taking a break.\nThat said, everything else with Splatoon 3 is looking good so far — and that's before we've seen the campaign, Salmon Run, and the new card game.\nThe post Splatoon 3 is already banning Splatfest cheaters, which is a good sign appeared first on Destructoid.",

It was a strategy game in-joke for so long that I couldn't believe it was really happening. I was provided a preview build of the upcoming socio-economic grand strategy game thanks to Paradox. To quote Sidra Holland and Jackie Chiles, it's \"real, and it's fantastic.\" And soon, you too can politick to your heart's content when the game releases on October 25, 2022.\nFor those of you present who aren't cool enough to know what the Victoria series is all about, an introduction is in order.

          "description": "11.5 million rolled their eyes at Everywhere\nLast week saw the return of Europe's largest gaming industry event, Gamescom, which arrived in both a physical and online capacity for the first time in several years. And, according to live stream host Geoff Keighley, it was quite the popular event, with over 12 million viewers tuning in to day one stream Opening Night Live.\nThe stream, which took place on the evening of August 23, featured a selection of trailers, updates, and reveals on some of the hottest games headed our way in the coming year (or two). Titles such as the mysterious Soulslike Lies of P, the goofy Goat Simulator 3, brutal sci-fi horror The Callisto Protocol, and the long-in-development Dead Island 2 all found time in the spotlight, with the two most watched trailers of the entire stream being the previews for Sonic Frontiers and an update for Genshin Impact.\nhttps://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1563947341337485322?s=20&t=6NCQfoav20yFFrvFLVZC-w\nIn addition to the success of the ONL stream, Geoff notes that around 265,000 visitors from over 100 countries made the journey to the Koelnmesse complex in Germany to be part of the live show. Attendees had the opportunity to chat with developers and publishers, play demos, and catch up with some of their long, lost industry pals. It seems, on the whole, that Gamescom 2022 was a success, providing Europe's leading live event brand with some much-needed positive press.\nThe next major gaming event will be Tokyo Game Show, which will take place September 15-18 in Chiba, Japan. Of course, just like with Summer Game Fest and Gamescom, we will be sure to report all of the hottest news and reveals from the event right here on Destructoid.\nThe post Over 12 million viewers checked out Gamescom Opening Night Live appeared first on Destructoid.",

I just didn't know it yet. Little hints and bread crumbs were laying there. Percolating theories were just waiting to be blown open to something big. And I just kept tugging at the threads.\nImmortality is the latest game from Barlow and co., and it sees Barlow returning to full-motion video similar to Her Story and Telling Lies.

Much like the fishing mini-game, Knucklebones is meant to flesh out the world of Cult of the Lamb and help you pass the time when you need a break from dungeon raiding or cult raising.\nIt's good fun, the kind that sticks with you longer than it should — and fans want more.\nOne Cult of the Lamb fan created a browser version of Knucklebones, and a…",

          "description": "It's been three years already?\nIt seems like Control didn't come out all that long ago, but I learned today that it's been three years since the game's release. Man, time flies when you enter the black hole that is a global pandemic. Seems on theme for Control, I guess. It's one of the best shooter experiences to come out of games in quite a while, in my opinion, so it's only fitting that Control developer Remedy Entertainment has put together an event so that fans can celebrate the anniversary in style.\nArguably the most exciting part of the Control anniversary event is something Remedy is calling \"Fans Ask the Fadens,\" where fans will have an opportunity to submit video questions to Courtney Hope and Sean Durrie, who play Jesse and Dylan Faden in the game. The videos need to be 20 seconds or under, quality of at least 1080p, and filmed horizontally. You can submit them here before the deadline on September 1st 20:00 EEST / 18:00 BST / 13:00 ET / 10:00 PT.\n\nLast week, the studio held a photo mode and fan art contest, and they've compiled their favorites under the community tab on their website. It's not too late to get involved, though — if you have some Control art that you're just dying to share, you can head to this website to upload it. You could have your art featured on their website or socials in the future!\nOf course, they're also having a 25% off sale on all Control merch on the Remedy Store, so you can snag some cool shirts, posters, tote bags, or journals if you've been in the market for 'em. However, that sale does end today (Aug. 29) so make sure to get on it if you're interested.\nUsually a game is released and that's about it, so it's cool to see Remedy keeping the community alive. They made a great game that has a bunch of fans, and giving us all a place to come together and celebrate one of our favorite games is something I wish other studios would take on as well.\nThe post Remedy celebrates three years of Control with a fan event appeared first on Destructoid.",

The final day of shooting was announced on Twitter by showrunner Michael Jonathan Smith.\nSet against the backdrop of a lonely and highly hazardous future, Twisted Metal will follow the misadventures of amnesiac courier John Doe (Anthony Mackie), who must run 'n' gun their way through a lawless wasteland in order to deliver much-needed supplies to an outpost, while perpetually engaged by parties of homicidal marauders. Like its source material, Twisted Metal promises outrageous comic-book characterization and hi-octane vehicular carnage.\nhttps://twitter.com/beardymcwhisker/status/1563627366106255360?s=20&t=sQuHh4Oqn995BA9sbFXItg\nAlongside Marvel superstar Mackie (Falcon and the Winter Solider), Twisted Metal will also feature a posse of recognizable and very talented faces including Will Arnett (Arrested Development), Neve Campbell (Scream), Thomas Haden Church (Spider-Man 3), and Stephanie Beatriz (Brooklyn Nine-Nine). The iconic role of the mass-murdering, ice-cream-loving clown Sweet Tooth falls to Nuufolau Joel Seona, better known to wrestling fans as the bone-breaking Samoa Joe.\nAs noted previously by VGC, it is believed that the new PlayStation Productions series will precede a brand new Twisted Metal video game, yet to receive its official reveal from Sony Interactive Entertainment. Twisted Metal is the second PlayStation Productions project, following its highly anticipated adaptation of Naughty Dog's The Last of Us, will which air on HBO in early 2023. It will be followed by an adaptation of Guerilla Games' dystopian sci-fi series, Horizon: Zero Dawn.\nTwisted Metal will premiere on Peacock in 2023.\nThe post Twisted Metal TV adaptation wraps filming for Peacock appeared first on Destructoid.",

A new cinematic trailer shown during Gamescom reveals a November release date, and it runs down the wacky cast of characters and why you'll be riddling them with bullets. \nThe largely CG trailer sprinkles in a bit of in-game action, though you should check out this previous gameplay video for a better taste of the over-the-top combat. We’re introduced to Grave’s allies who band together to take on a fearsome foursome of antagonists looking to rule the world (probably). Fans of the PS2 games and the anime that spawned from them will be happy to know that G.O.R.E. looks as bombastic and absurd as they'd expect. Newcomers that enjoy bullets, blood, and insanity will likely feel right at home. \n\n\nGungrave G.O.R.E. launches November 22 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Pre-ordering nets you a special Grim Reaper skin designed by former Tango Gameworks designer Ikumi Nakamura, who is working on G.O.R.E. as a character artist.",

It’s worth a read if you consider yourself a diehard fan (check it out here), but the most exciting news from the conversation is the confirmation that the next game in the series is in development.\nHřebíček writes: \n“A few years away” is a long time to wait, especially since the last mainline entry, Mafia III, is approaching six years old, launching in October 2016. But we're happy to see the series continue and are curious to see where it heads next. In 2020, Hanger 13 released enhanced remasters of all three games, the most substantial being a complete remake of the original dubbed Mafia: Definitive Edition. \nWhat do you want to see in a new Mafia game?

          "description": "Netflix has reportedly canceled its Resident Evil series after just one season. \nThis news comes from a report from Deadline, which reports that Netflix has decided not to move forward with a second season of the show following the release of Season 1 last month. As far as why, there’s no official reason as of yet but considering Netflix’s past, it’s likely that Resident Evil didn’t meet expectations in terms of both critical and audience response. The show will now join many other shows canceled after just one season at the streamer including Cowboy Bebop, The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance, and more.\nDeadline notes that Resident Evil’s release came right after the highly anticipated Season 4 of Stranger Things, which might have led to its less-than-stellar first weekend on the service. However, the series still debuted in the number two spot, behind Stranger Things, pulling in 72.7 million watch hours. Deadline reports that viewers watched Resident Evil for 73.3 million hours in its second week, taking the number three spot on Netflix, before dropping out of Netflix’s Top 10 by week three. \nThis isn’t Netflix’s first foray into the world of Resident Evil, though. Its 2021 movie, Resident Evil Infinite Darkness, holds that title, but that anime series wasn’t well-received either. For more about the series, check out this retrospective video that looks back at 25 years of Resident Evil. \n[Source: Deadline]\nDid you watch Resident Evil on Netflix? What did you think of it?

Former editor John Carson scored the game an 8.25 out of 10, writing in his review that, \n“Despite its minor shortcomings, Nobody Saves the World kept me enthralled from start to finish as I leveled my way through form ranks for the next body or ability to work with.

Microsoft then declared later that day that it will not be doing the same with the Xbox Series X/S. Now, Nintendo has chimed in on the matter. \nIn a statement to Eurogamer, Nintendo reiterates a quote from president Shuntaro Furukawa, made in June, in which he stated the company has \"no plans to increase the trade price of its hardware.” Furukawa made this statement during the 82nd Annual General Meeting Shareholders that month, in which he also said: \n\"While we cannot comment on pricing strategies, we currently do not have any plans to change the price of our hardware due to inflation or increased procurement costs in each country. We will determine our future pricing strategies through careful and continued deliberations.”\nAlthough the PlayStation 5's price will remain unchanged in the U.S. (for now), both versions of the console have become more expensive in Canada, Europe, the UK, Mexico, Japan, and Australia. The price hikes have already gone into effect in those regions except Japan, which occurs on September 15. \nThe only time Nintendo significantly adjusted the price of its current consoles was last fall, when it permanently reduced the cost of the standard Switch model in the UK and Europe. Nintendo has yet to do the same in the U.S. \n[Source: Eurogamer]",

Over three minutes of gameplay footage shows off the carnage you'll unleash against adversaries, both artificial and organic. \nPlayers wield melee weapons or firearms in one hand and more, shall we say, unconventional abilities in the other. That includes electrifying targets with lightning bolts, tossing them around with a telekinesis-like power, freezing foes solid with an ice blast, or using wires to hijack machines. The action-packed video shows off how players can creatively combine their arsenal to dismantle and disembowel anything standing in their way. \n\n\nAtomic Heart was first announced in 2018 and takes place in an alternative futuristic version of the Soviet Union in 1955. Robotic technology flourished post World War 2, allowing humanity to create a high-tech utopia. Unfortunately, these mechanical helpers have started rebelling against their human creators. If that wasn’t enough, killer mutants born from secret experiments have also run amok. Players control private agent P-3, who embarks on a secret mission to get to the bottom of what’s caused this seemingly perfect society to collapse and clean up this mess. \nAtomic Heart launches this fall for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

He believes that this is a good thing for the gaming industry in the long run. \n“[It] is something we’re just going to see less and less of,” when discussing the idea of specific games being exclusive to a single device. “Maybe you happen in your household to buy an Xbox, and I buy a PlayStation, and our kids want to play together, and they can’t because we bought the wrong piece of plastic to plug into our television.\n“We really love being able to bring more players in reducing friction, making people feel safe, secure when they’re playing, allowing them to play with their friends, regardless of what device – I think in the long run that is good for this industry. And maybe in the short run, there’s some people in some companies that don’t love it. But I think as we get over the hump and see where this industry can continue to grow, it proves out to be true.”\nBloomberg also asked Spencer about the status of Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard acquisition, how the company will handle unions and ongoing unionization efforts happening within Activision Blizzard, and more, so be sure to check out the publication’s full story here. \n[Source: Bloomberg]\nDo you believe Spencer’s right?

Despite this lack of innovation, Blossom Tales II still manages to capture many of the acclaimed elements of what many consider to be one of the greatest video …",

So, it’s only fitting that Gamescom 2022 ended with two trailers (cinematic and gameplay) for the long-overdue zombie-slaying sequel. \n\n\nWe follow a chiseled survivor named Jacob as he leaves the safety of his (bloodied) condo and ventures into a Californian hellscape swarming with undead. He kills several adversaries with an empty rifle, jutting it through their rotten bodies and smashing their heads against the pavement with its wooden butt. \nThe gameplay trailer shows scenic beaches, forsaken suburbs, cratered city streets, and still-lit carnivals. In what is one of the most graphic clips I’ve ever seen at a game show, we watch as the player-character clobbers zombies with blunt objects, jump-kicks adversaries off roofs (parkour mechanics?), and shoots gasoline tanks to engulf hordes in flames.\n\n\nDead Island 2 is a first-person action RPG with six playable characters. And according to a designer who appeared onstage, the gory romp has an irreverent, pulpy tone and gameplay that’s all about “experimenting with your preferred zombie-slaying methods.”\nDead Island 2 punches and kicks its way onto PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on February 3.",

Plenty of blood is shed as humans are used as lab rats in Murkoff Corporation's Saw-like tests. In some cases, the tests just look like torture and flatout murder.\nThe game looks overly graphic, yet also brings about comparisons to BioShock's tone and storytelling conventions. It'll be interesting to see how the narrative sews all of these wild experiements together. The Outlast Trials is designed as both a single-player and cooperative experience. The player clearly is free to explore at certain points, and appears to rely on trap-like devices to fight back and escape. In one sequence, we see two players helping each other up to higher ground.\nThe footage concludes with news of a short closed beta running from October 28 to November 1. No other release date news was shared.",

To bring this beloved science-fiction universe to life, Telltale enlisted the development talents of Deck Nine (best known for the Life is Strange series). The first pre-alpha footage looks ambitious and dark, delivering a cinematic viewpoint into an investigation riddled with death.
