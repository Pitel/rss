          "description": "Wonder boy.\nWhen Super Mario World first released back in 1990 (or '91 or '92 depending on your region), it felt like a huge moment for Nintendo's iconic platforming franchise. Here was Mario as we already knew him, bounding energetically through 2D environments on the way to his usual goal but, at the same time, everything felt as though it had changed.\nSuper Mario World was a thorough modernisation of all of the important pieces that made the series tick. The world and its characters were brought to life like never before with a broader range of animations and abilities, and mechanically things had taken a huge step up in terms of responsiveness and polish. This was the best a Mario game had ever looked or felt, it was full of fun and magic, it brought the somewhat ageing formula up to speed and remains one of the very best adventures the Italian plumber has ever taken.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Fortunately, publisher and developer Phoenix Labs has been quick on the case and the game's latest update (ver. 1.4.0) seems to have even more bugs in its sight.\nThere are a good number of fixes this time around ranging from gameplay to more specific features. Some of the stand-out changes are the in-game clock pausing when you use the storage shed or mailbox in single-player (shout out to the time management fans out there!), tweaks to the relationship mechanics and a fix that keeps your animals producing materials for you.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

As it turns out, this is something that Miyamoto was asked back in the days of the NES, and only with Super Mario Bros. Wonder, has Nintendo managed to visualise the reason.\nAccording to a new 'Ask the Developer' interview that Nintendo has published today, Miyamoto's answer back then was because the Goombas bite Mario on impact (at least, that's the way that Wonder's art director, Masanobu Sato remembers it), and so the Wonder developers decided to add an animation into the upcoming platformer to make this statement a reality.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

While it improves on some of the shortcomings of Front Mission 1st: Remake, the combat system isn’t fun enough to fully salvage this tactical RPG. While it might be worthwhile for strategy fans eager to test out G-Craft's 1997 PlayStation game that never got released outside of Japan, we can’t see Front Mission 2: Remake offering much to anyone else.\nIt’s a shame that the actual combat in Front Mission 2: Remake is so frustrating because the story is much improved over the previous entry. You control a group of soldiers who find themselves on the losing side of a coup and are trying to flee the nation of Alordesh.

Movie had on the game. You might assume that the film's forecasted success (remember, both were in development around the same time) would have weighed heavily on the developer's minds, potentially even influencing the bros. new game designs; but, as it turns out, this was not the case.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The horror manga artist has an immediately recognisable style that intersects detailed, line heavy art with strange and upsetting concepts, and some of his short stories have acquired a sort of semi-memetic status (\"This is my hole! It was made for me!\"). If you're at all familiar with Junji Ito's work you will look at unforgiving almost-text-adventure World Of Horror and go \"Huh, that's inspired by Junji Ito.\"\nThis isn't just because it looks like his work but rendered in MSPaint, or because it contains, just, direct references to it, but because of the whole vibe. You encounter face-sloughing-off kinds of monsters and vengeful spirits inspired by Japanese folkloric yokai, but also weirdo janitors doing stuff like turning the swim team into mermaids in a kind of pervier version of Tusk. At the same time, there's a streak of the Lovecraftian in play to keep it nice and legally distinct, as each self-contained run at the titular world is an attempt to save your town from destruction at the hands of an Old God (they earn the leaden thud of the capital letters). You will fail a lot. But isn't failure part of the fun!? Imagine that enthusiastic question as a big spoonful of marmite popped into your mouth.\nRead more",

Created by Odd Meter, the studio behind the well-received fantasy VR bow simulator Sacralith: The Archer's Tale, and published by Frostpunk developer 11 bit Studios, it's a \"very serious adventure game\" set in 19th century Russia, which casts you as a troubled young Orthodox Christian nun. Awash with doubts about her faith, and persecuted by a mysterious creature, the woman flees her nunnery and falls in with an escaped convict, who tells her of a mysterious \"holy elder\" who might ease her troubles, drawing on the power of a sacred artefact.\nThe game's setting is naturalistic, with motion-captured facial animations and photorealistic buildings and interiors, wrought using Unreal Engine. But it is also a \"fairy tale\" landscape, in the words of studio co-founder Dmitry Setlov, shot through with phantasmagorical flourishes - monochrome or blood-red filters and apparent hallucinations, to say nothing of the aforesaid creature, a skulking mass of tendrils that puts me in mind of the Shadow from Ursula K Le Guin's novel A Wizard Of Earthsea.\nRead more",

On 19th August 1839, a young man opens his eyes to find himself in a vast, silent castle in the forests of Prussia. He discovers a letter from his \"past self\", Daniel, who urges him to murder the castle's secluded owner, a baron named Alexander, and warns that he is being hunted by a monstrous Shadow. 60 years later on New Year's Eve, the celebrated meat factory owner Oswald Mandus starts awake in the opulent stillness of his manor house in London. Hearing the distant voices of his children, he goes to look for them in the \"splendid architectures\" below.\nOn 21st July 1916, at the height of World War I, the soldier Henri Clément stumbles from his sickbed in a colossal bunker beneath the Western Front. With nobody about, and no memory of events during his convalescence, he follows a trail of blood through the collapsing tunnels towards the pantry. And on an unknown day in March 1939, the engineering drafter Tasi Trianon wakes in the wreckage of a plane, deep in the Algerian desert, and enters the nearby caves in search of her husband Salim. Four games, four forgotten pasts, four new beginnings, one descent.\nBeware: major spoilers for the entire Amnesia series below.\nRead more",

It's good, folks, and there's a lot to dig into with its release into early access this week. \nThere's a sizable story campaign and a bunch of side missions already playable here, and its emphasis on stealth and escalating security levels whisked me right back to the good old days of 2015 when I first sat down to play Klei's stealthy masterpiece. There are still a couple of rough edges here and there, but if you've been looking for a strategy RPG with a harder-edge than, say, Mimimi's recently released Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew, or just something a bit sneakier than your run of XCOM-likes, Cyber Knights: Flashpoint is definitely worth keeping an augmented eye on.\nRead more",

I myself had to go lie down after seeing Phil in a Phantom Dust shirt. Teaser-shirts, we should have called them. Look at him in the picture up there, showing off a chestful of Hexen. Shameless!\r\n\n\r\nSadly/happily, those halcyon days are behind us, but Phil still loves to dangle the carrot of an ancient IP now and then.

Really, I think it comes down to developer Sledgehammer's decision to mash some of COD's previous triumphs with some of its finest maps.\nDespite COD extending its hand with a warm welcome back, I can't help but feel it's one trembled with nerves.

          "description": "The fleetingly Epic Games-owned online audio distribution company Bandcamp have shed \"at least\" half their staff in the course of being sold off to Songtradr as part of mass layoffs at Epic this summer. That's according to the union Bandcamp United, who are even now restarting discussions with Epic in the hope of obtaining a better outcome.\nIt's terrible news for those affected, of course, but it also doesn't bode well for the future of independent music. Bandcamp, which has now traded hands twice in two years, is one of the few places where indie musicians can make a living. There are plenty of angry reactions from musicians and bands on social media, as you'd expect, but game developers are also rallying in support of Bandcamp United, with criticism aimed at Epic and Songtradr in equal measure.\r\n\n \nRead more",

This is a thing Goldman I have in common. To help you tell us apart, a point of difference between Goldman and I is that he expressed his love of stupid courage by writing Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid, whereas I express mine by really liking Cyberpunk 2077.\r\n\nStupid courage is a trait that CD Projekt Red's first-person RPG seems to admire, but that's never more clear than in a new ending to the base game added by the Phantom Liberty expansion. It shows what happens when the heroes reject stupid courage and choose self-centred pragmatism instead. Spoilers for Cyberpunk 2077 and Phantom Liberty throughout.\n\n \nRead more",

One was a mind-bogglingly complex, almost military-grade-looking briefcase stuffed full of switches, nozzles and buttons, and the other was an impossibly cute cardboard flip book and projector combo that let its cartoon hero Bib bound across the 3D paper environments to find a way home.

Hermit And Pig is indeed a game about a reclusive old hermit and his truffle-hunting pig, but this charming adventure RPG also has one of the most involving turn-based battle systems I've come across in a while. \nTaking place in first person a la Dragon Quest, Hermit must deal with all sorts of mad and angry wildlife as he hunts for his favourite forest mushrooms, and their scowling (and endearingly daft) expressions are just the tip of this excellent iceberg. For you're not just choosing from a list of moves and watching them play out onscreen. Oh no. Each attack also comes with its own three-button fighting combo, and you'll need to input the right one (often at the right time) to deal the most damage. It's a brilliant system, making Hermit And Pig easily one of this year's highlights from EGX's Leftfield Collection. \nRead more",

          "description": "If you played a videogame at all in 2022, I hope it was Roadwarden. A blend of RPG and visual novel from Polish developer Moral Anxiety, it cast you as lonesome wayfarer maintaining the paths and investigating the mysteries or grievances of a thinly populated wilderness setting. It's a game of immense feeling, craft and cleverness, inspired by table-top games, which puts hoarier ideas about videogame role-playing through the wringer. In the world of Roadwarden, there's no grinding for XP or mindless loot-crafting treadmill. Knowledge, empathy and insight are worth far more than material wealth or wielding the shiniest axe. Quests can hinge on something as minute as your ear for dialects or knowing the correct form of address. And each village along the trail is a world in itself.\r\n\n\r\nMoral Anxiety's Windy Meadow - which actually dates back to before development of Roadwarden, but has been substantially remastered since the latter's release - essentially narrows the focus to one of those villages. Out today, it's a quietly gorgeous visual novel in which you follow several characters in different timeframes, building up a layered understanding of one and the same setting, with scene transitions plotted on a beautiful pixelart map screen.\n Read more",

As explained by Minecraft game director Agnes Larsson, the forthcoming Minecraft update – which has yet to be given a release date – is designed to “focus more on combat adventures and on tinkering” than last year's Cave & Cliffs update.\nThe headline addition is an underground structure called the Trial Chamber, a procedurally generated cluster of traps and treasure rooms, fashioned from copper and tuff blocks and arranged around a central hallway. From the Minecraft Live footage this weekend, Trial Chambers look like an evolution of the game's old buried fortresses, with some nifty new flourishes in the shape of copper bulb blocks that slowly give off less and less light, and new Trial Spawners, which generate a certain number of hostile mobs based on things like the number of players in your party.\r\n\n \nRead more",

A tasty one-more-go-er, perfectly suited to serving up in these dreary autumn months. There.

Built out of a game jam prototype from 2020, Leximan casts you (sorry) as a would-be wizard who's struggling to make an impact compared to his more verbally proficient schoolmates. In this particular demo, he's woken by a friend to go and assist the school cook with preparing breakfast, but things go horribly awry when a pesky fire elemental turns up to spoil it all.\nRead more",

Any point and click adventure game that makes a bid trying to be funny like the good old days has a very real chance of being painfully unfunny in my experience (looking at you, Deponia), and I was worried that Loco Motive would fall into the same try-hard pile as other so-called comedy adventures that have come out recently (see also Turnip Boy - yeah, I went there, fight me). But having played a timed 20-minute demo of it at this year's EGX, I'll hold my hands up and say, yep, I'm the one who's been slapped in the face with a giant custard pie here, as Loco Motive is genuinely really quite good, folks, and I'm pleased to report the good old days are still very much alive and kicking. Well, except poor old Lady Unterwald, who carks it within seconds of the game starting, and whose murder you end up getting framed for.\nRead more",

Whether it's in my own, real-life home or in a game, I am compelled to scrub, wipe and tidy - and the oily, purple globs of gunk clogging up Loddlenaut's appropriately named region of Flotsam Flats are just begging to be zapped by my little diver's handy laser gun. With just a single squeeze of the trigger, he sets to work, moving his arm automatically to neatly attack each neighbouring blob without any further prompting or manual aiming. All I need to focus on is getting him close enough to the gunge and he'll take care of the rest. Sure, it's perhaps not quite as involved as your PowerWash Sims and other polish em ups, but the combination of Loddlenaut's lo-fi visuals, comforting score and surprisingly soothing controller rumble all work to give it its own kind of zen-like charm - and it was enough to make me forget the surrounding din of the EGX Rezzed Zone for a very enjoyable 20 minutes or so.\nRead more",

He’s not alone on his journey either. As well as his mates from the first LAD, plus lots more newcomers, mainline Yakuza stablemate Kazuma Kiryu, now extra frosty with his silver hairdo, is also coming along for the ride as well. \nAlas, the circumstances in which the two join forces wasn’t covered in my 30-minute demo at this year’s EGX. Rather, we pick up Ichiban, Kiryu and fresh faces Chitose and Tomizawa as they land in Honolulu, in search of a dodgy cop named Roman who's managed to wrong almost everyone in the group at some point in the past. 30 minutes isn’t long in a game like Yakuza, but hey, I still got to screech at restaurant goers in one of its sidequest stories, as well as terrorise the general public on Ichiban’s always-deployable segway, which I’d still call a pretty strong introduction to this latest LAD.\nRead more",

This spooky lantern might open up some cool realm-hopping twists on your grim adventure, and the game as a whole might instil a sense of exploration sure to please souls fans after a familiar hit of uncertain peril, but its finer details chip away at your patience. It's not long before your tentative pushes through horrible towns and creaky walkways soon give way to wild sprint finishes born from pure frustration.\nRead more",

          "description": "Whereas most games begin by getting you into the action as quickly as possible, Saltsea Chronicles opens with a quick note about its save system. It's a small, but important detail in this story-driven adventure game, as throughout its nine-to-ten-hour run time, you'll be faced with various decisions about where your crew of post-apocalyptic drifters will explore next, as they set sail in search of their missing captain Maja. By choosing one island at the end of every chapter, you'll naturally miss out on visiting another - and with 14 locales to explore in total in the Saltsea archipelago (and only 12 chapters to do it in), each playthrough has the potential to end up being quite different from the last.\nBut up front it tells you \"There are no wrong choices, only your choices\" in Saltsea Chronicles, and that ultimately this is a tale about \"tracing different pathways\" using its clever branching save system. While you can, of course, play it through from start to finish in a single swoop, you also have the option to purloin its additional save slots to take those roads less travelled (presented here as delightful, wiggling seaweed tendrils), and all without overwriting your existing adventure. Immediately, that sense of FOMO is dispelled, and instead of worrying about 'seeing everything' or making sure you get a 'good' playthrough, you can simply enjoy its enthralling tale of high seas soap opera, curious exploration, and the knotty drama that comes with trying to forge connections in an increasingly fragmented world. It's a journey well worth taking, even if what lies at the end of it didn't quite come together in the way I'd hoped.\nRead more",

In this deceptively Civilization-esque 4X strategy game, all player turns unfold simultaneously, once you've decided what to build or research, where to move your units, and so on. As Oxide Games design director Michelle Menard tells me over Zoom, this approach takes inspiration from an ancient military simulator, Kriegsspiel, which was devised by the Prussian army officer George Leopold von Reisswitz, aka the \"father of wargaming\", in the mid-1800s. \r\n\n\r\n\"It was to train their generals, it was a legit apparatus of war, it was not for funsies,\" says Menard. \"And they basically created this massive table that had a modular terrain system. At first they used sand, but that was kind of messy, [and so] they developed a system where they had interchangeable tiles, like hills and valleys and plateaus. \r\n\n\r\n\"They would build out this table, literally drop a sheet down the middle, and it'd be like, OK, you guys on each side, you can't see what the other person's doing. There was an actual game master, who was the referee who you would report your moves to. He would then re-set up the board and basically call people back into the room and be like, tada! It's the next turn - let's see what people did. Was it what you expected?\" \r\n\n \nRead more",

Fantastic news, it's been binned off! In the course of making what they're calling \"the largest technical leap in CS history\", Valve have decided to discontinue support for MacOS. They're also doing away with support for older PCs, including DirectX 9 and 32-bit operating systems - in future, the game will be exclusive to 64-bit Windows and Linux systems. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Sometimes, when I’m winning a Total War battle handily, I like to pick an absolutely haggard group of low-tier hopelesses and spend the rest of the fight zoomed in on them, narrativising their high-stakes struggles in a rich and velvety internal monologue that monopolises my attention so fully that I more or less ignore the rest of the battle. That these are among my absolute favourite Total War moments may say something about the level of satisfaction to be found elsewhere in the series’ strategy sandboxes, at times as robust as ancient oaks, others as stale as ancient wotsits. It may be an admission on both our parts that, for all its simulated complexity, Total War is really for people who’d be just as happy playing with those little elasticated catapults and plastic castles, if we could still sit on the floor without our pelvises crumbling into soup mix.  \r\n\n\nTotal War: Pharaoh, which I will acknowledge once and once only as being officially stylised PHARAOH, is almost certainly the most systemically interesting and quality-of-life-full a Total War game has been at launch for a very long time. Three Kingdoms has better diplomacy, Warhammer has unequivocally better goblins, but none are as refreshingly cavalier and passionately thorough with the blueprint of what Total War has the potential to be. CA Sofia should be immensely proud of what they’ve done here, but the realities of Total War’s ridiculous release schedule now clearly mean that even a studio as willing and able to innovate so much in such a short time frame are effectively prevented from producing a genuinely exciting strategy game. I’d love to tell you these new plastic castles are more fun than your old ones, but there’s not even any catapults.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Meta may have spent the last couple of years tumbling down a metaverse rabbit hole, but the company is still responsible for creating the best VR hardware around. The Meta Quest 2 was the ideal gaming VR package: powerful and accessible enough to provide easy, convincing immersion, while also staying highly affordable. Nonetheless, Meta’s sudden fixation on creating a legless version of Second Life did have me worried about the future trajectory of its VR hardware. What daft gimmickry would their next headset come festooned with, and what would it mean for the future of the Quest as a gaming device?\r\n\n\r\nWith the Meta Quest 3, we have the answer. And the truth is, Meta’s latest headset does have a whiff of Metaverse about it. Dubbed a \"mixed reality\" device, its raison d’être is to break down the barrier between reality and the virtual world. While mixed reality is an angle I’m not wholly sold on from a gaming perspective, crucially, the features that make it a mixed reality device are useful even if you don’t want to hold a meeting in your office with a bunch of bisected Sims. Moreover, they’re built into a headset that is more powerful, more comfortable, and generally better than the Meta Quest 2.\r\n\n \nRead more",

From there, the team \"actually spent about six months seriously developing live commentary,\" according to Nintendo's Koichi Hayashida, in hopes of adding voices that matched the player's actions.\n\n\nDuring development, a generic \"newscaster\" voice and a \"Tsundere\" option were entertained.

But, before we do, developer Insomniac Games is encouraging players to download the day one patch.\n\n\n\n\nIn an image post made via Twitter, the developer confirms the entire game is present on the disc for physical players, and is fully playable without the need of a patch. But, “for the best experience, we highly encourage physical/disc-based players to download update Version 1.001.002 on launch day — prior to experiencing the opening mission of the game for the first time.”\n\n\nThe studio went on to explain the day one patch — which serves to add “polish to the gold master version” of the game’s physical edition — will be auto-loaded for any digital players who pre-load the game. In addition to polish, the day one patch “improves the opening sections of the game” and adds accessibility options, according to Insomniac.\n\n\nMarvel’s Spider-Man 2 is set to continue where its predecessors left off, allowing players to explore an expanded NYC as they fight both new and existing villains such as Venom, Kraven the Hunter, and Lizard. It looks pretty good, judging by our own review from Chris Carter where it received a 9. It is set for release on October 20 exclusively for the PlayStation 5.\n\nThe post Insomniac encourages Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 players to download day one patch appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "CD Projekt RED is following through on its promise to stop official support for Gwent this year, but not before releasing one last update. The company announced on Gwent's website that a final update is coming, but the card game's future isn't ending.\n\n\nAlongside the balance update is the inclusion of \"Gwentfinity,\" which hands balance to the player base. The feature's announcement came last year alongside Gwent's sunsetting, so it's something fans have expected. \n\n\n\n\nNot all of Gwent will be in players' hands, as CD Projekt Red is employing a skeleton team to manage its infrastructure. This will ensure the game remains operational while keeping players generally in control.\n\n\nHow balance changes will work going forward is with the community-run Balance Council. Becoming a member involves being at Prestige 1 and Pro Rank for the season or winning 25 games in the season. These restrictions are to ensure eligible voters are community members deeply familiar with Gwent's meta.\n\n\nBalance Council members will get to participate in monthly votes that potentially change a set number of cards. Restrictions include voting for up to three cards within certain brackets to ensure changes without breaking the game.\n\n\nBeyond the newfound community control and some oversight from CD Projekt Red, Gwent will no longer see any new cards. This means any changes will be made with cards already implemented within the game.\n\n\nGwent's last update comes not too long after CD Projekt Red announced it is laying off around nine percent of its staff. Hopefully, all affected can find new workplaces and any remaining staff can effectively manage Gwent's community.\n\nThe post Gwent is releasing its final developer update, and handing balance to its players appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Capcom has released the second big update for their robot-powered dinosaur murder game, Exoprimal. Among the added features are the anticipated Street Fighter crossover skins.\n\n\nDo you remember Exoprimal? It’s the game that everyone thought might be a new Dino Crisis when it was first announced, but then it turned out to be a live service multiplayer title. It’s actually pretty good! But pretty good is sort of a bad place to be in the live service market where most of the pie is being greedily gobbled up by a few of the most popular games. It’s an extremely over-the-top game about killing interdimensional robots that come pouring out of portals while also trying to beat another team at being the best dino killers.\n\n\nImage via Capcom\n\n\nThe update includes some great stuff alongside the Street Fighter skins. There’s a new map called Ocean Platform that takes place on a platform out in an ocean. Also added is a new Final Mission alongside it called Escape. There are two new rigs, Edge Strike and Drone. Two new modules are getting thrown into the mix. Finally, there are a bunch of new rewards, balance changes, and bug fixes. You can check them out over here.\n\n\nI’m curious to know what the player population is like with Exoprimal. Did it find its audience? Let’s see. The average player count for the last 30 days on Steam is 89.9. Eesh. At least there’s crossplay.\n\n\nExoprimal is available on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.

From Resident Evil 4 to Death Stranding, the newest phones and tablets will support more graphically intense games.\n\n\nYet this isn't the tech giant's first massive push into gaming. Apple Arcade has been around for several years and is home to mostly casual titles. At $5 a month, it's not a bad deal to download some time-killers when nothing else is around.

          "description": "RedDeer.Games has announced they’re handling the console publishing of MGP Studios and Solid9 Studios’ Project Downfall, a neon-drenched first-person shooter with shades of Hotline Miami. It’s coming to Switch in November, followed by Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S sometime later. Sorry, PlayStation fans.\n\n\nProject Downfall is a psychedelic shooter that leans heavily on Hotline Miami while transplanting its gameplay to a first-person perspective. It’s heavily about slow-motion takedowns of groups of enemies, swapping weapons frequently, and throwing the ones you’re finished using to buy yourself some time. Your character is a wealthy businessman with a chip on their shoulder and a thirst for blood. There’s actually a plot buried beneath all the action involving global politics, but I’m fairly certain the protagonist cares little about that and just wants to perforate thugs.\n\n\n\n\nI played Project Downfall this past January but only got through about an hour-and-a-half with it. I remember parting with it on bad terms, but for the life of me, I can’t remember why. I recall being a bit perturbed by how similar the narrative was to Hotline Miami, but I think I had an issue with the gameplay, as well. I just don’t remember what specifically.\n\n\nIf you do manage to make it through, there are 12 different endings for you to get depending on the choices you make throughout the game. Weirdly, the one new feature they tout for the console version is “a completely redesigned lighting system for Nintendo Switch.” Woo!\n\n\nProject Downfall is currently available for PC. The Switch version will be released in November followed by Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S sometime after that.\n\nThe post Trippy FPS Project Downfall is coming to consoles starting with Switch in November appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It could well be argued that without the original Doom, there wouldn't be much of an FPS golden age, and that includes games like Half-Life. So, imagine my surprise when it turns out that someone has managed to take the aforementioned titles and package them under one roof. Kind of.\n\n\nIf you've always wanted to know what Doom 2 would be like with Half-Life's sound effects, then ModDB user DASniperIC (thanks, PCGamesN) has just the thing for you.\n\n\n\n\nIf you want an idea of what it sounds like when the enemies of one game cry out like injured scientists in the other, the footage gives you a taste. Not only does the mod replace the enemy howls and roars with things like Black Mesa scientists, but all the weapons now sound like they come from Valve's IP, too.\n\n\nImps as headcrab zombies...what a world!\n\n\nAs DASniperIC says, it's entirely possible someone else has tackled the concept already. However, this version is simply their take on a Doom/Half-Life crossover.\n\n\nIt's one of a gazillion ways that these legendary shooters continue to get the modding treatment and thus remain in the gaming limelight. Classic Doom is certainly no stranger to mods, having spent the better part of three decades receiving tweaks and custom options from its community. \n\n\nAs for Half-Life, well, that's still getting a lot of love these days, even more so the sequel. In any case, modding legendary FPS games shows no signs of slowing down. Maybe someone will combine Doom with another game from a bygone era, like Blood. Oh, wait. That's totally a thing. \n\nThe post Here’s Doom 2 but all the sound effects have been replaced with Half-Life’s appeared first on Destructoid.",

No more is this true than with Outlast Trials, the newest installment in Red Barrels' twisted series.\n\n\nIn a recent post on Twitter/X, the developer has teased a new \"objective enemy\" that's being added to the game, specifically the Trial Map: Courthouse. This is all in conjunction with an upcoming update for the Outlast title. While there isn't a release date for the update yet, the tweet says it'll be coming by the end of October, and we all know what that means.\n\n\n\n\nAs for the new enemy themselves, the disturbing image depicts a man in pain, stripped of all but his underwear and wearing a makeshift helmet. Wires crisscross their exposed body, inserted into numerous parts, and the words \"SHE'S GUILTY\" can be seen scratched onto their leg.\n\n\nWell you weren't expecting a unicorn, were you?\n\n\nAlongside this, Red Barrels has restated some details about the upcoming console ports. Yes, Outlast Trials is coming to Xbox Series X|S and PS5. However, it's also getting Xbox One and PS4 versions, and will also have crossplay with PC.\n\n\nSadly, there's no definitive date for when these ports will be happening. All we know is the studio plans to unleash them sometime in \"early 2024.\" Hopefully we'll have more information soon.\n\n\nAs we inch closer to Halloween, you can look forward to the new Outlast game rolling out new maps and cosmetics, a new mini-game for the lobby, and that happy chap above.\n\nThe post Outlast Trials teases new enemy, plus new content coming soon appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "I was introduced to the work of Junji Ito quite some time ago with “The Enigma of Amigara Fault.” That particular story haunted me for a while before I finally dove into his work proper, and I’m still waiting to see if there’s a bottom to it. He often tells stories that start with grounded simplicity before quickly dropping them into a vat of inexplicable and undefined horror. He does a great job of starting off with a world that is uncomfortably off before pushing it to incomprehensible extremes. It’s not an uncommon approach to horror, but it’s one that his personal flourish aids so well.\n\n\nI explain this because World of Horror is impossible to untangle from its inspiration. It feels very much like if Junji Ito had designed a monochromatic NEC PC-88 adventure title. The art style and st…",

          "description": "After a long hiatus, we're about to experience an explosion of Silent Hill releases. From the official remake of the second game to brand-new entries, Konami's iconic horror series is finally making a comeback. Along with these is Silent Hill: Ascension, which has just released its premiere trailer.\n\n\nBilled as an interactive experience that viewers can influence the outcome of, Ascension's recent teaser gives a little taste of things to come. It also confirms – though we already knew at this point – that the \"live series\" will begin on October 31, starting at 9pm ET / 6pm PT. You can pre-install it by going to the official website.\n\n\n\n\nIt's being developed by J.J. Abram's Bad Robots Productions company in conjunction with Behaviour Interactive (yes, the people behind Dead by Daylight), Genvid Entertainment, and DJ2 Entertainment.\n\n\nMake your choices\n\n\nEach day, viewers will get to decide what happens to the characters in the Silent Hill experience. You'll get to watch (play?) it while also making decisions in real time. The story will play out depending on audience choices.\n\n\nThe story is described thus:\n\n\n\nThe Hernandez family plummets into chaos as another death shakes their decimated rust-belt town in Pennsylvania. In a dying fishing village in Norway, the uneasy peace of the Johansen family is upended when their matriarch, Ingrid, dies under suspicious circumstances. Survival depends on them overcoming their darkest impulses and the machinations of a cult, as they discover the horror that connects them.\n\n\n\n\nWhile it's almost certainly going to be likened to such things as Bandersnatch, Ascension is at least a unique way of reigniting the Silent Hill flame. While many of you are eagerly awaiting Bloober Team's remake of SH2, Bad Robots' interactive offering is something a lot of horror fans will also be looking forward to.\n\nThe post Check out the official Silent Hill Ascension premiere trailer appeared first on Destructoid.",

Wonder.\n\n\nIn the early days of the plumber’s signature franchise, each game was branded with a sequential number. Most of us are familiar with the original NES trilogy (squabbles about the “real” Super Mario Bros. 2 notwithstanding), but slightly less known is that Super Mario World was actually labeled as “Super Mario Bros. 4” in Japan. However, after this fourth mainline entry, the series took a sharp turn away from that classic side-scrolling style. Super Mario World 2: Yoshi’s Island is a stellar game, but it's not one that I nor Nintendo consider a mainline Mario game. And with Super Mario 64, it appeared that the moustached hero’s future was now firmly in the third dimension.\n\n\nWe, of course, got a return to c…",

          "description": "Igor Aleksandrowicz has fully released their retro-inspired FPS, Calcium Contract, on Steam. It will run you $15.99.\n\n\nI first tried out Calcium Contract back in July and came away impressed by its unique and unusual take on the subgenre. Back then, I said, “It feels like if Duke Nukem 3D was designed by a studio localized within McDonaldsland.\" I kind of stand by that. It’s a bizarre and colorful experience about a Grim Reaper who has to bring down a chicken serpent that simply refuses to die.\n\n\n\n\nUnlike most other games in the genre, Calcium Contract isn’t about big guns and bigger explosions. Its arsenal consists of a number of strange contraptions that shoot things like musical golden bones. Likewise, the enemies are a vast mixture of chickens, cats, and lizards. Aleksandrowicz says their focus was on “game feel” and that really shows. There are lots of small touches that are used to heighten your connection with the world, and cleverly removing wall-humping secrets means that the pacing is never bogged down.\n\n\nIf anything, Calcium Contract’s biggest issue is that it doesn’t have a lot of the biggest selling points that people look for with these sorts of games (i.e. big guns and bigger explosions). That’s too bad since it’s every bit as intense as one with more conventional munitions. My hope is that it will still develop a large following in spite of this.\n\n\nUnfortunately, I don’t think I’ll have time to do a formal review of this one. However, my preview earlier in the year covered a pretty sizeable chunk of the game (more than what was included in the demo), so the preview I did will still hold true today.\n\n\nCalcium Contract is available right now for PC.\n\nThe post Calcium Contract is out now to fulfill all your weird FPS desires appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Last time I was face to face with an aerial Moby Dick, it was in Death Stranding. Well, it's back to the skyward trenches, apparently, because massive mammals are on the menu in Project: Mist. Developer Chicken Launcher and publisher Awaken Realms revealed the title as an open-world survival horror game that gives off serious The Forest vibes. \n\n\nThanks to Gematsu, we know a little more about the colossal terrors of Project Mist. While there's no release date, Project: Mist is in the works for PC and, as promised, features flying whales front and center. If that's not too harrowing for you this Halloween season, you can see them along with other sizable threats in the announcement trailer.\n\n\n\n\nProject: Mist promises \"full freedom\" with \"no forced quest[s], no hand holding, no telling you what to do.\" You're basically plopped smack dab in the middle of a harsh world with survival as the main goal. As you no doubt noticed in the trailer, flying whales aren't the only thing you'll have to worry about. There are big ugly heads, nasty mouth things, and even bigger and slimier dudes? Those aren't the canonical Project: Mist names, but they'll do for now. \n\n\nThankfully, it sounds like you'll have plenty of countermeasures at your disposal. In addition to building a base and defending it from threats, you can create traps, weapons, and other essential items. There are axes, crossbows, guns, and apparently a \"game-changing\" Gravity Gun. It's not clear exactly how that one works yet, but maybe we'll learn more soon.\n\n\nChicken Launcher not included\n\n\nThe developer behind Project: Mist previously worked on games like 2022's No Place Like Home. The cute, relaxing sim garnered some positive reviews, and seems as thematically distant from Chicken Launcher's latest as possible. A Steam page is live now, so we'll just have to wait to learn the secrets of the giant wall. \n\nThe post Project: Mist looks like The Forest with flying whales and giant heads appeared first on Destructoid.",

The shoes are not yet empty, but Onion Soup Interactive is looking to fill them anyway with Super 56. That’s bold, but while they’re doing some heavy lifting to the formula, they’re bringing along their own drinks to the party. To be fair, it isn’t even WarioWare’s party. Puzzle & Action: Tant-R has been dancing since ‘93, but even I’m not certain they were the first to arrive.\n\n\nSuper 56 is a microgame rush.

          "description": "Spotted by Twitter user Timur222 and reported by Game World Observer it appears that the latest to be affected by layoffs within Embracer Group and the video game industry in general are Cryptic Studios and Zen Studios.\n\n\nThe news has come as a result of multiple employees within the studios updating their Linkedin profiles to seek new employment opportunities. Because of this, it’s unknown just how many are affected by these layoffs, which appear to have happened last week, and Embracer has not released a statement to clarify.\n\n\n\n\nCryptic Studios rose to prominence with the development of City of Heroes (my favorite MMO) and continues to maintain Champions Online, Star Trek Online, and Neverwinter. Meanwhile, Zen Studios is the developer behind the Zen Pinball and Pinball FX series.\n\n\nThe layoffs are part of a continued cost-cutting campaign by Embracer Group. The company had previously launched an aggressive acquisition campaign and bought out a number of developers, large and small. This seems to be related to a $2 Billion dollar investment that reportedly fell through earlier in the year.\n\n\nEmbracer isn’t the only one conducting layoffs. This year has been horrible when it comes to people losing their jobs, not just in the video game industry but the tech industry in general. The list is a bit long, and it’s really depressing, so I’m just going to copy what Destructoid’s own Eric “Boulder Puncher” Van Allen wrote previously:\n\n\n\"A brief list includes Epic Games, Striking Distance Studios, CD Projekt Red, multiple studios owned by Embracer Group including Beamdog and Crystal Dynamics, Ubisoft, BioWare, Relic, Riot, Firaxis, and Microsoft. Plus reports of more at Twitch, Naughty Dog, and Team17.

          "description": "Mark “Markiplier” Fischbach has posted a short teaser for his upcoming film adaptation of Iron Lung, a 2022 horror game from David Szymanski. According to Fischbach, who is directing, writing, and starring in the adaptation, it's  “coming soon to theaters”. A nice surprise for fans used to his work launching as YouTube exclusives. \n\n\nIn the teaser, which features music by Andrew Hulshult and narration by JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure voice actor Mick Lauer, we see what is presumably the main character emerging from a sea of blood and ominous lightning. \n\n\n\n\nFans of Fischbach (and, by extension, listeners of his podcast Distractible) will note that he recently went to the hospital on his birthday because he went “too deep in the blood.” The stunt resulted in his eyes turning a worrying shade of red. It was clear at the time that it was related to the production of Iron Lung, but now the teaser makes it clear it's most likely the cause of that incident.\n\n\nIron Lung is “a short horror game where you pilot a tiny submarine through an ocean of blood on an alien moon,” according to developer and publisher David Szymanski, known for works like DUSK, Chop Goblins, and Squirrel Stapler. Fischbach announced a film adaptation in April, and fans have received periodic behind-the-scenes updates both via YouTube and Distractible.\n\n\nDestructoid’s Zoey Handley had this to say about Iron Lung: “It’s a brilliant approach to the horror genre. It keeps you feeling perpetually vulnerable. There is nothing to help you and absolutely no escape. Your only option is to keep pressing ahead, as there’s no rescue until the job is done. Don’t get distracted, ignore the sounds. Hurry, but be careful not to bash into a wall. I don’t think it’s possible to represent that idea better in an interactive medium. Iron Lung really is the perfect short-form horror experience.”\n\nThe post Markiplier posts teaser for Iron Lung film, is coming to theaters “soon” appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Systemic Reaction has announced that they have canceled further development on their multiplayer dinosaur FPS, Second Extinction, and has removed it from sale on marketplaces. Servers are set to close down for it in 2024.\n\n\nSecond Extinction entered Early Access in October 2020, and never really left. The initial goal was to fully launch late last year, but that got delayed due to “critical issues.” After assessing things, the team has decided just to drop it and move on.\n\n\n“Unfortunately, it became clear that our small team lacked the resources necessary to hit our quality targets and exit Early Access and Game Preview, and the investment needed to do so was too large for us to bear. After evaluating our options and working during this year to find other potential solutions, this became the reality our team had to face.”\n\n\nInterestingly, Systemic Reaction is part of Avalanche Studios Group, which, in turn, is a subsidiary of Nordisk Film. If we take them by their word, then that must be one hell of a corner they painted themselves into.\n\n\nEvery cloud, I guess\n\n\nWhile the cancellation of a game that people have already paid for is pretty crappy, there is one silver lining here:\n\n\n“Although this isn’t the outcome any of us hoped for, we want to assure you that there are no layoffs associated with this decision.”\n\n\nIdeally, studios should be able to make mistakes and be able to turn around from it. It’s just not a great look when the expense is all on their supporters. The developer doesn’t really have the best track record to begin with, having made Generation Zero and Ravenbound, neither of which got the best reception. Perhaps that’s part of the decision to can Second Extinction.\n\n\nNonetheless, there’s always a chance for a developer to turn things around, and here’s hoping that Systemic Reaction can do just that and gain back the trust of the supporters who might feel burned by this cancellation.\n\nThe post Second Extinction ends further development, gets delisted appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It's not been a great launch for Payday 3. As well as experiencing issues with matchmaking, the new entry in the bank-robbing FPS has also had its first major patch delayed. Now, the developer has issued yet another apology, saying that the anticipated update needs \"additional time.\"\n\n\nOver on Twitter, the official Payday 3 account apologized to fans for the \"lack of communication regarding the first patch.\". Starbreeze Studios says it's found more issues to rectify before the patch launches. \n\n\n\n\nAn additional post underneath notes due to the additional time needed to tend to the game, the studio can't provide an ETA on when fixes will launch just yet. A third tweet adds a suffix to this apology, saying that both the patch and some more news are inbound. We just don't know when.\n\n\nMaybe it'll be worth it in the end\n\n\nWhile the studio did do some maintenance to make Payday 3's matchmaking better, one of the major criticisms with the game is the always-online feature. This means that even if you want to play a solo campaign, you're still required to connect to the server.\n\n\nHowever, there is a possibility that an offline mode could come to the game. In a previous post on Twitter/X, the team said that, because of server issues at launch, \"we are discussing every option available to us, including offline mode.\"\n\n\nHopefully, Payday 3 will eventually become the game fans want it to be. At the moment, it has a \"Mixed\" review score on Steam, with more than a few unhappy customers. Starbreeze has a chance to turn things around, though.\n\nThe post Looks like the Payday 3 update has been delayed…again appeared first on Destructoid.",

On the one hand, the streaming platform is experiencing peak viewership, but on the other, the company is reportedly laying staff off. Still, it's business as usual, and it looks as though the Amazon-owned company now wants a slice of that social media pie.\n\n\nIn a recent blog post, Twitch announced the introduction of stories to its app. Those who regularly use Facebook or Instagram will already be familiar with this feature. Essentially, Twitch has \"made it easier for you to reach your community directly on Twitch, through short posts that expire in 48 hours.\"\n\n\n\n\nThis appears to be a work-in-progress and will have \"more features in the coming months\". And given Twitch's reputation for being a hotbed of hatred and general toxic behavior, safety measures are factored into stories \"in a way that fosters a safe space for you and your community.\"\n\n\nNot available for everyone yet, though\n\n\nHowever, the post does make it clear that this feature is not rolling out to all users just yet. For now, they're \"currently limited to Partners & Affiliates who have had at least one stream in the last 30 days.\"\n\n\nThere are plans to make it available to eligible users by the end of the week. However, streamers will need to \"meet the minimum eligibility requirements.\" There's always a catch with these things.\n\n\nWhatever you think about the new feature, it seems Twitch is looking to keep its head above water by rolling out additional bells and whistles. It could be a neat way for content creators to stay in touch when not live. Equally, it could be another headache in an era already swamped by social media.\n\nThe post Twitch goes down the social media route by introducing Stories appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Just in time for the holidays, Whitethorn Games and Gameous have announced that Lake: Season's Greetings will launch on November 15, 2023.\n\n\nSeason’s Greetings is a prequel chapter of the small-town slice-of-life game Lake. Set before the events of the base game, you’re dropped in Providence Oaks as protagonist Meredith’s father, Thomas Weiss. He was previously an offscreen character in Lake, but now will get to color in the backstory with his own point of view. It’s 1985 in a small town, and that’s sort of relaxing. Let’s rent some horror and shove it into the VHS player.\n\n\n\n\nNot only that, but, as the title implies, the town is completely cloaked in snow. Thomas is delivering packages during the height of the holidays, which probably means Christmas music. I can’t say I’m down for that because I have a lot of trauma from working in retail for a couple of holidays. It might be even worse than that pop country in the base Lake.\n\n\nI felt pretty lukewarm about Lake back when I reviewed it. This was mostly because I felt that the narrative really thought you should love small towns and look down on the busy lives of urban dwellers. I grew up in a rural area, and while it has its comforts, it’s not all fresh apple pie and how-do-you-dos.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I love a good holiday game and am often interested to see if a developer takes feedback into account when revisiting a concept. November might be a busy month, but maybe I’ll be able to fit in another visit to Providence Oaks.\n\n\nLake: Season's Greetings launches on November 15, 2023 on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.\n\nThe post Lake’s Season’s Greetings DLC will be home for the holidays on November 15 appeared first on Destructoid.",

As per Colossal Order's latest announcement, the studio has decided to hit its targeted release date even though this means launching with less-than-stellar optimization. In other words, early adopters of the long-anticipated city-builder may end up struggling to run the game properly on day one.\n\n\nThis information comes from Colossal Order's recent forum announcement, where the post states: \"Cities: Skylines II is a next-gen title, and naturally, it demands certain hardware requirements.

          "description": "If you thought we were done talking about Starfield mods, think again. One of the great things about PC gaming (typically) is the ability to tinker with vanilla releases. In this case, one person has taken Bethesda's sci-fi RPG and injected a dose of Doctor Who.\n\n\nOver on Nexus Mods, user xShadowBlitzz has brought the iconic Daleks to Starfield, replacing the sanitation mini bots that scuttle about the place.\n\n\nImage via xShadowBlitzz/Nexus Mods.\n\n\nFrom the description, this mod is currently a work-in-progress, featuring three textured Daleks so far. It also looks as though they don't have their sound effects yet, but they could be coming in a future update.\n\n\nAre we bored with Starfield yet?\n\n\nThere's no denying that there's a lot to see in the game, but the newest IP from the Skyrim studio already feels like it's dropped off the radar a tad. Its hype was all too real, with the game becoming one of the most successful launches of this console generation.\n\n\nIt's too early to say at this stage, but some may be wondering whether it will outlast the likes of TES5. The 2011 fantasy RPG has somehow kept itself in the limelight (probably helped by all those re-releases). Some of this longevity can be attested to the modding community.\n\n\nWhether Starfield will be able to boast such a legacy more than ten years from now cannot be said. However, if Bethesda keeps on top of things with new content and bug fixes (look it up, Todd), it could stand the test of time. Also, mods. More mods will probably help.\n\nThe post Starfield meets Doctor Who in this Dalek mod appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The 7th Guest is a 1993 puzzle adventure game that was released on PCs in 1993, just a few months before Myst. It was an early instance of a fully modeled 3D location, and its use of FMV actors for its cast felt like you were looking into the future of video games. It received a few underwhelming sequels and other adaptions, but The 7th Guest VR marks arguably its biggest and boldest reimagining. Effectively a remake, this version of the game takes the familiar locations and story and adds in new puzzles and new performances. Considering the original game (and this remake) is about exploring a spooky house and solving puzzles, it feels at home in VR. You can watch Wes LeBlanc and me check out the game below.\nFor a whole lot more on The 7th Guest, you can read our oral history of the game right here. You can also take a look at this translated interview between Mario and Zelda creator, Shigeru Miyamoto, and Spirited Away director, Hayao Miyazaki, from the early 90s where Miyamoto called the game \"inspiring\".\n\n\nHead over to Game Informer's YouTube channel for more previews, reviews, and discussions of new and upcoming games.

It did so for several reasons – its beautifully realized visuals, top-notch voice acting, and, of course, the potential to play as some of my favorite characters in a Metroidvania-esque adventure. That wasn't all, though; The snippets of composer David Housden's score in the reveal trailer indicated this team was on to something. \nIt was clear from the first listen that Housden and Dlala put a lot of effort into making Illusion Island sound like Disney.

Now, Analogue is targeting the Nintendo 64 catalog with its next device, the Analogue 3D. \nAnalogue has shared an image of what appears to be the device, although the full look at it is obscured. You can view it at the top of the article, but it's below as well:\nAn image released alongside today's news teases what appears to be a sleek, black, and faithful recreation of the Nintendo 64 controller. You can check it out below: \nAnalogue says the 3D device will feature 4K HDMI output, its proprietary Analogue OS, wireless Bluetooth, and 2.4G Wi-Fi. It will also have \"4 original-style controller ports,\" presumably so that players can use their original Nintendo 64 controllers with the 3D. The company says the 3D's 4K output allowed \"us to created incomprehensibly profound Original Display Modes,\" and that in collaboration with 8BitDo, it will release a wireless controller for the device. \nAnalogue didn't share more, but the 3D is set to release some time in 2024. Preorders are not yet open, but if it's like the Pocket release, preorders will happen well before the actual release (and if you want one, plan on preordering because the Pockets sold out immediately). \n\nWhile waiting to learn more, read Game Informer's Analogue Pocket review. \nAre you excited about the Analogue 3D?

Join us as we take a bloody journey through the game's genre-defining story campaign.  \nAfter 2006's Mortal Kombat: Armageddon seemingly concluded the franchise's main narrative, 2011's entry picked up the bloody pieces. It moved the saga forward by resetting the timeline, serving as a soft reboot that brought Mortal Kombat back to its 2D fighting roots and ushering in the return of the classic roster. MK 9's cinematic story mode served as an epiphany for the series and fighting games as a whole, establishing the blueprint for narrative fighting campaigns still utilized today. MK9's story also serves as the first chapter of the modern trilogy of games that Mortal Kombat 1 builds upon. For a whole lot more on MK9 and its development, you can read this feature on how the reboot saved the franchise.\nJoin editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they battle their way through MK 9 to see how its reimagined tournament holds up. \nPart 1 - Surpr-iced! \nPart 2 - Bringing The Smoke\nPart 3 - Staff Meeting\nPart 4 - My Life As A Lin Kuei Robot\nFinale - Waking the Dragons\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

Unfortunately, co-op is restricted to local play. Living alone and working remotely makes couch co-op a tricky proposition, and the only way for me to test this is by using the PS5’s Share Play feature with another editor, but that feature won’t work until the game launches next Tuesday. Until I can get a sense of what it’s like to take down badniks with another person, my general thoughts on Sonic Superstars is that if you’re looking for a Genesis-era throwback, Sonic Team and Arzest have nailed it …",

Now, roughly a week later, Ubisoft has revealed that Mirage's player count is in line with Origins and Odyssey.

Both the disc drive model and the digital model will be updated, but these two models aren't as different as they used to be: you will now be able to purchase a disc drive separately, allowing you to upgrade a digital model to a disc-compatible version. Both versions will be available this November, and will eventually replace the current model of PS5 altogether.\n\"The new PS5 has been reduced in volume by more than 30%, and weight by 18% and 24% compared to the previous models,\" the PlayStation blog post reads. It also mentions that the new covers have different textures, which isn't immediately clear from the pictures. \"There are four separate cover panels,\" it says, \"with the top portion in a glossy look, while the bottom remains in matte.\" This does raise questions about the compatibility of console shells Sony currently sells that allow you to change the look of your console, but this question is not addressed in the announcement.\nThe slim PS5 with a disc drive will still cost $499.99. The PS5 digital edition retails at $449.99, a $50 increase from the original digital edition. \nIf you do buy a newer digital version and decide to upgrade it to a disc version, the drive will cost you $79.99 in the US, €119.99 in Europe, £99.99 in the UK, and ¥11,980 in Japan. The total cost of a digital console and a disc drive is a little more expensive than buying a disc drive version outright. The console will include a new horizontal stand to set the console on its side, and a vertical stand will be on sale for $29.99 USD | 29.99 EURO | 24.99 GBP | 3,980 JPY. You can watch the reveal trailer below:\n\n\nFor more PlayStation 5 news, read about how president Jim Ryan is stepping down, read our list of top 5 PlayStation 5 games, and check out our gameplay breakdown for the PS5 exclusive Marvel's Spider-Man 2.\nAre you interested in this newest model of the console?

          "description": "Ubisoft revealed its \"fast-paced firefights meets punk rock mosh pits\" first-person shooter, Tom Clancy's XDefiant, in 2021. It's a free-to-play shooter that features factions from different Ubisoft properties, like Splinter Cell, Watch Dogs, The Division, and Far Cry. We went hands-on with XDefiant earlier this year and came away impressed with the shooter. Players enjoyed an open beta back in June, and the full game was set to launch in the summer, but now, developer Ubisoft San Francisco has delayed its preseason launch indefinitely. \nThe team announced this on Twitter yesterday, revealing that the recent Public Test Session was a success but highlighted some inconsistencies in the game experience it wants to address before the preseason launch. As such, the preseason launch has been delayed to a later unspecified date. \nHere's Ubisoft's full statement on the XDefiant preseason launch delay: \nAn update on XDefiant- pic.twitter.com/3orSnspmp6\nOctober 9, 2023\nAs you can see, Ubisoft doesn't indicate when to expect the Preseason launch to happen, making this an indefinite delay. \nIn the meantime, watch Game Informer's XDefiant New Gameplay Today and then read our XDefiant impressions after going hands-on with the game earlier this year. \nHave you played XDefiant?

According to The Verge, a source familiar with Microsoft's plans indicated that it was aiming for Friday, October 13, as a date to close the deal. Ignoring the infamy of the date (it seems Microsoft and Activision Blizzard executives aren't very superstitious), it's not a surprising day to choose. Back in July, the two parties in the deal jointly agreed to extend the deadline of their agreement to October 18 in order to sort out any further regulatory concerns. At the time of publishing, that date is only twelve days away, so the deal would have to be closed soon.\nStill, the Microsoft legal department will have to deal with a few more legal challenges before they're completely out of the woods. After restructuring the terms of the merger to grant Ubisoft the rights to stream Activision Blizzard games in the UK, the Competition and Markets Authority granted the deal a preliminary approval, but the regulator still has to make a final assessment sometime before October 18. Still, Microsoft and Activision Blizzard each took this as a major win.\nWe are encouraged by this positive development in the CMA’s review process. We presented solutions that we believe fully address the CMA’s remaining concerns related to cloud game streaming, and we will continue to work toward earning approval to close prior to the October 18…\nSeptember 22, 2023\nThis news followed the companies' victory over the Federal Trade Commission back in July. At this point, it seems fairly likely that the deal will go through, ending a saga that began almost two years ago. After documents from the hearings leaked and revealed Microsoft's hybrid console, a new Xbox model, and plans to acquire other companies like Sega and Bungie, Microsoft is probably ready to leave the entire matter behind it.\n[Source: The Verge]\nHow do you feel about the acquisition coming to a close?

The initial Dark Side support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC. Additionally, there are two playable demos if you want to test the game.
