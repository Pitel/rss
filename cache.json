The lovely Alex, Zion, and Felix will be hopping into the demo at 6am PDT / 9am EDT / 2pm BST / 3pm CEST, and you can watch them sling ink at the field (and others) over on YouTube!

Not to worry though, as I've once again gathered team RPS to tell me in detail about the games that caught their attention during Geoffcom 2022.\r\n\n\r\nMuch like our E3 roundup from earlier in the summer, each RPS staffer took ten minutes out of their day to wax lyrical about an upcoming project featured within the showcase. All eight (including yours truly, who thanks to Katharine actually remembered to contribute this time around) chose completely different games.

Nonetheless, The Great War: Western Front, a combination of macro planning and tactical RTS battling revealed this week at Gamescom, has elected to lean right into WW1’s complexities and difficulties rather than dance around them.\n\r\nDevelopers Petroglyph have gone for historical accuracy in various ways, senior designer Chris Becker and audio director Frank Klepacki explain to me at a hands-off demo in Cologne. The soundtrack will even include licensed music from the era. But something they want to really hammer home is the brutality of the war: territory won’t be won in heroic pushes but slowly and bloodily, while collapsing morale is as much a danger as any advancing army.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The Dark Pictures Anthology is, well, a horror anthology, each a compact standalone scary game where you explore and deal with QTEs and hazardous choices, in the vein of Supermassive's smash hit Until Dawn. The idea, says Heaton, is that each one takes one or two horror sub-genres and mines them, maybe subverting the tropes here and there. Up next is The Devil In Me, inspired by the infamous Chicago serial killer H. H. Holmes. \n\"What I think we decided with The Dark Pictures games early on was that the next game in the series would be very different from the last game, because we want to keep it fresh, we want to give the audience new,\" Heaton explains. So, after a zombie ghost ship in Man Of Medan, the psychological witch hauntings in Little Hope, and military squad vs. vampire aliens in House Of Ashes, Heaton pitches The Devil In Me as kind of Saw meets The Shining. It's a serial killer slasher in a weirdo hotel, and it has a true crime element. And I have to say, it's probably the most excited I've been for a Dark Pictures entry.\nRead more",

I've felt proud a number of times at this year's Gamescom so far, marked first by an excellent McDonald's choice (honey crisp chicken and bacon) on the first evening, followed by a doner kebab that put it to shame. And in a non-savoury twist, today it was being a member of the first squad to complete the Warhammer 40K: Darktide demo mission – the sweetest feeling of them all, and a perfect team-bonding exercise.\nThe bonus emotions? Surprise and... not being so surprised. Surprise that we'd accomplished such a feat, but not so much surprise in the game itself. It was, as expected, a good co-op FPS time! But a very familiar one.\nRead more",

There are people who love doing the management bits - the bean-counting, optimising the amount of salt on fries to make people thirsty and buy more drinks, paying close attention to demographics and average spends and that sort of kidney*. Then there are people who want to design a park full of cool-ass rides and different themed zones, a true magical wonderland. Inside this Park Beyond are two wolves, in other words, and each needs a different but equally robust set of tools to wrangle.\nAfter some hands on with an early build of Park Beyond, I have a little more faith that Limbic Entertainment are going to be able to pull it off. The toolset for building a rollercoast is, in particular, impressive. It's never been so easy to make a ride that breaks both the laws of physics and the laws of health and saftey. The coasters in this game are an absolute menace. In a good way.\nRead more",

The Indonesian team have now terminated their contract with PQube and delayed A Space For The Unbound until they can find another publisher.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "The only Zelda game I've played was Link's Awakening, on the Game Boy. I do not feel short changed by this. In fact I get the distinct impression it was one of the best, if not the one that most distilled the series' essence.\nThat essence has made its way into Blossom Tales II, a charming light adventure game in the classic \"going on an adventure\" sense rather than the \"rubbing every item on every other item until you're allowed to play again\" genre sense.\nYou're playing out a story playfully told by your grandfather, who's cast you as the wee hero of a village out to rescue your brother from the sinister Minotaur King. Both of you occasionally interject, sometimes prompting a decision that changes the game a little as your granddad amends things to your liking. It doesn't go to the full meta-narrative lengths of a Juarez Gunslinger with it, but it's a cute touch and keeps the framing relevant.\nRead more",

Unlikely as it may seem you were right, and everyone else was wrong. It's called Moonbreaker and it's hitting early access on September 29. And Brandon Sanderson is at this party, too.\nI admit it was a trick question, but look, I'm a genuinely big fan of devs doing a completely different project after a successful game. I also know a whole lotta people who love painting plastic fighters in cool colours, carefuly placing them on a tabletop, and slowly pushing them into other plastic fighters in different colours. I'm absolutely sure that Unknown Worlds will make a very good version of a digital tabletop strategy game. I must admit, though, that whenever a video game like this emerges, I sort of wonder why tabletop-thusiasts would buy it instead of more actual miniatures.\nRead more",

Well fine then, game.\nSome of these bug reports have come from inside the house, namely Liam and Rebecca, whose respective characters have a) involuntarily shot out their own windscreen immediately upon entering every single car and b) fallen through the world when attempting to mount a motorcycle.

          "description": "To call the current state of the world today ‘tumultuous’ would be a bit of an understatement. For LGBTQ+ people - and trans people in particular - the increasingly extreme rhetoric and legislation being weaponised against these communities can feel all-consuming. Yet it comes at a time when diverse representation in media, including games, is improving. As the number of characters stated to LGBTQ+ grows, what is more effective representation: making it possible to see your own experiences on screen, or make those experiences understandable to someone who isn't LGBTQ+?\r\n\n\r\nPeople who know of it would perhaps cite the work of developer and translator npckc, who I recently spoke with at the recent Japanese indie gaming event Bitsummit. They were there to showcase their latest game A Pet Shop After Dark, a departure from visual novels like A Year Of Springs trilogy into horror storytelling (\"more spooky than outright horror,\" as they later clarified) that's set to release later this month. Beyond the trilogy and their newest work, they’ve translated the works of other developers and worked on other smaller games and game jam projects.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "The last year or so of Elite Dangerous has been the most dramatic since the game launched in 2014. The most recent update to Frontier Developments' epic space sim, Update 13, saw the conclusion of the story's Azimuth Saga, culminating in a disastrous attempt to stop the incursion of the Thargoids – Elite's hostile race of insectoid aliens. It's an event that has already had a major impact on Elite's universe, and Frontier are excited to discuss the studio's plans for the game and its narrative as it pushes into a new phase for the galaxy, simply known as \"Aftermath\".\nBut the drama surrounding Elite Dangerous isn't limited to the game's overarching story. As I gear up to chat with lead game designer Luke Betterton and senior producer Samantha Marsh, the Thargoid in the room is Elite Dangerous: Odyssey. Launched in May last year, Elite's second expansion was, to put it lightly, not well received by Elite's community. Complaints ranged from extensive bugs and performance issues to more fundamental criticisms about the implementation of the expansion's on-foot exploration and FPS combat. Over a year on from release, the expansion still carries a \"Mostly Negative\" rating on Steam, standing in stark contrast to reviews for vanilla Elite Dangerous (now bundled with its Horizons expansion), which remain firmly positive.\nRead more",

The new in-house venture will focus on releasing soundtracks from the French publisher's litany of PC and console games.\n\"Microids Records and the new Entertainment Division are testaments of Microids’ willingness to develop the company’s brands and contents wider than the video game medium,\" said Microids' VP of entertainment, Frédéric Claquin. \"Being able to launch this label with two original scores signed by Inon Zur is a blessing and a true honour, especially as we celebrate the Syberia series' 20th anniversary.\"\nAs noted in the above statement, the first two releases from the label will be Inon Zur's dramatic scores to adventure titles Syberia 2 (2004) and Syberia 3 (2017). Going forward, fans can expect further releases from the new label, which has been formed as part of Microids' ongoing desire to increase its merchandising output beyond the realm of the physical video games themselves.\n\"This music label launch is a major milestone for Microids” adds company CEO Stéphane Longeard. \"We have always had at heart to offer music scores enhancing the games we are creating and paying tribute to our great IPS, collaborating with renown artists like Inon Zur for instance. We are fully aware about the importance of a great musical atmosphere for players, and we cannot wait to share what will be released next under the Microids Records label!\"\nMicroids' next release, Asterix & Obelix XXXL: The Ram From Hibernia, will launch on October 13.\nThe post Microids is starting up its own in-house record label appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's still a great 3D platformer with a slick sense of speed, an interesting world to explore, and yes, some nods to Nintendo's creature-chucking strategy series.\nIf you're someone who enjoys hunting down collectibles, it's a must-play. If you're more on the fence, and run the risk of feeling overwhelmed with too many trinkets to find, I can still recommend Tinykin. It's never unreasonable, and there's little if any downtime.\nThe indie game scene has been killing it with shorter yet still satisfying experiences, and this one's a fantastic distillation, albeit with a few elements I wish went further.\n\nTinykin (Nintendo Switch, PC, PS4, PS5 [r…",

          "description": "Playing with the Boys\nSomething a little more low-key from the retro fun-fans over at Hamster this week, as the labyrinthine Arcade Archives has been bolstered with the arrival of Video System's hard-spikin' Super Volleyball on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.\nReleased to the arcade market in 1989, before receiving home ports on the Sega Mega Drive and the TurboGrafx-16, Super Volleyball is an incredibly typical take on the high-jumping beach sport. Two teams of four players battle it out on a very basic 2D plane, with each team representing one of eight global nations.\nWhile Super Volleyball features neat animation and some neat picture-in-picture cutscenes, it has a generally clunky vibe and seems dated, even by 1989 standards. The same year would see other sports titles such as Midway's Arch Rivals, Technos' WWF Superstars, and Sega's Super Monaco GP. By comparison, Video System's release feels several years out of time and is admittedly a tough recommend in 2022.\nYou can check out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber Victory-Class Star Destroyer. Super Volleyball is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LckZxkh6D4\nThe post Super Volleyball gets its spike on in the Arcade Archives appeared first on Destructoid.",

The feature, when toggled on, plays dialogue through the PS5 DualSense controller via haptic feedback.\n\"That way a deaf player can feel the way a line is delivered, can feel the emphasis, along with the subtitles to give some sense of how that line is delivered,\" said Gallant.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LINKh60I8CY\nAnother new feature the team has is audio description for cinematics. Naughty Dog partnered with Descriptive Video Works, a service that works in TV, movies, and game trailer, to integrate audio description into cutscenes and across all localized languages.\nEasing access\nAlongside the new tools, The Last of Us Part I also features a ton of the accessibility features seen in Part 2. This includes vision accessibility, with tools like High Contrast Display and HUD scaling. Hearing accessibility tools are also available, adding subtitle names and direction, as well as pick-up notifications and awareness indicators.\nIt's nice to see Naughty Dog carry on with these features into future games. The Last of Us Part II was recognized for its accessibility features. It's cool to see developers to continue building on and prototyping new features that can only help more people engage with their games.\nThe Last of Us Part I hits PlayStation 5 on September 2, 2022.\nThe post The Last of Us Part I accessibility features include letting players ‘feel’ dialogue through the DualSense appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Russian studio Konfa Games also acquired\nAmerican Publisher tinyBuild Inc, following a particularly expensive morning, has announced that it has acquired several IPs from indie studio Bossa Games. As reported by GamesIndustry.biz, the memeriffic \"comedy physics\" titles Surgeon Simulator, I am Bread, and I am Fish were purchased by tinyBuild for an \"upfront payment\" of $3 million USD.\nFollowing the closure of this purchase, tinyBuild will now manage developmental control of all three titles, while Bossa Studios will move on to new projects. Despite the relative simplicity of the games, the former Bossa franchises have raked in millions of dollars in revenue since their respective releases.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6COQHqc4LE\n\"Since early 2022, Bossa has been focused exclusively in the genre of co-op PvE. We have been prototyping a lot, and now find ourselves in full production of titles we are pouring our hearts and souls into,\" writes Bossa co-founder Henrique Olifiers of the company's future. \"This brought us to the question of how best to take care of our legacy, our existing games, and how to ensure they have a future of their own.\"\n\"Together with TinyBuild, we found a path that allows Bossa to dedicate its full attention to its new projects, while ensuring Surgeon Simulator, I Am Bread and I Am Fish have a new home that understands what makes these games tick as well as we do.\"\nIn addition to the Bossa IP acquisition, tinyBuild also announced that it has purchased independent Russian studio Konfa Games for $5.4 million. It is reported that the Konfa team will now relocate to tinyBuild's Serbian headquarters, where it will continue development on its current projects, including the cartoonish roguelike Despot's Game: Dystopian Army Builder, which is available now on PC.\nTinyBuild acquires Bossa Studios IPs for $3m [GamesIndustry.biz]\nThe post TinyBuild acquires Bossa Studios ‘comedy physics’ IPs for $3 million appeared first on Destructoid.",

In classic Square Enix fashion there's some extras to be had, as well as the opportunity to pick up the PC, PS4, PS5, and Switch editions of the game.\nAs for details, it's still being billed as a single-player RPG, which kind of goes with the territory of the offline pivot. Dragon Quest X offline will arrive on September 15, 2022 in Japan, but there's also going to be an \"ultra large expansion\" coming in spring of 2023. The standard edition will run you roughly $60 US, while the special edition is about $115 US, and includes the expansion, physical pins, a slime mug, and a spoon for said mug. The list of in-game items can be found here.\nYou can also go for the digital deluxe edition that nets you the core game and the expansion for about $95 US. Options! Well, for folks who want to pick up the Japanese edition of the game, at least.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHAYsq3Uuk8&t=45s\nThe post Dragon Quest X offline still exists, launching in Japan in September appeared first on Destructoid.",

LET ME INNN!\nCapcom has started to reveal its itinerary for the upcoming Tokyo Game Show (TGS) 2022 event, which is scheduled to take place next month at Chiba City's Makuhari Messe complex. In addition to appearances from Resident Evil Village, Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection, and Exoprimal, Capcom will also be bringing a brand new build of its incoming blockbuster, Street Fighter 6.\nThe new build will differ from that currently being courted at Gamescom, Summer Game Fest, and VS Fighting in that it will feature playable appearances from characters Guile, Juri, and Kimberly, joining the previous demo's roster of Ryu, Luke, Chun-Li, and Jamie for a flashy roster count of seven World Warriors. This will give TGS attendees a world-first opportunity to check out the three new characters, something which isn't leaving yer boy seething with envy in any manner whatsoever.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGuVJXwENQk\nIn addition to the new Street Fighter 6 demo, Capcom will also be holding two live streams across the duration of the show. The first is the Tokyo Game Show 2022 Capcom Online Program, which will look at all of Capcom's other incoming releases, (though the publisher has confirmed Resident Evil 4 will not be in attendance at TGS 2022). The second stream, Tokyo Game Show Street Fighter 6 Special Program, will be focused purely on the new slugger, and is expected to feature at least one new character reveal trailer. Exciting stuff!\nOf course, for those not in attendance, LIKE ME, all of the pertinent news for Street Fighter 6 and all other titles being showcased at TGS will be reported right here on Destructoid. While the remainder of 2022 is looking like something of a quiet year for big releases, there's no denying that 2023 is shaping up pretty nicely, and TGS will only add fuel to that hype fire.\nTokyo Game Show 2022 will take place at Makuhari Messe between September 15-18.\nThe post Street Fighter 6 will have playable Guile, Juri, and Kimberly at TGS 2022 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Before the event, we're getting a taste of Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty gameplay, which is a nice surprise after the cinematic reveal at the summer Microsoft game showcase. The bosses and environments so far look worthy of the Nioh series, which is a good sign.\nIn addition to the footage, Koei Tecmo shared a few scarce details, like the existence of the \"five phases\" battle style mechanic, as well as the use of offensive and defensive maneuvers (which seems to be a huge focus of the system). We also got reconfirmation of a whole bunch of housekeeping stuff. Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty will launch on PC (Steam), PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X in \"early 2023.\" It's also confirmed as a console and PC Game Pass title.\nIf you're attending TGS, there's a few bonuses involved for those of you who can check it out physically. If you play the game in any capacity, you'll get a \"button badge\" for Wo Long. If you finish the demo, you'll get a t-shirt (while supplies last, Koei Tecmo points out). We'll also get footage of a \"never before seen stage\" at the event from the game's producers (Fumihiko Yasuda and Masaaki Yamagiwa). That'll all be at the Koei Tecmo Games booth (Hall 3, Makuhari Messe).

          "description": "CNBC refutes incoming sale announcement\nThe financial analysts at CNBC have shot down circulating rumors that retail giant Amazon is preparing to announce that it has purchased legendary developer/publisher Electronic Arts (EA).\nStories of the acquisition began circulating within the last hour, which understandably caused an immediate spike in EA stock value. Since then, however, \"industry sources\" speaking with CNBC's David Faber stated that such a deal has not been struck, nor has Amazon even made a bid toward EA in regard to purchasing the studio. Bloomberg Terminal has similarly doubted the claim.\nThe initial story, posted by USA Today, cited that Amazon had already tabled an offer to the FIFA, Madden, and Mass Effect studio with an eye to acquiring the publisher and its IP catalog. Speaking fairly, USA Today rumors are believable, given ongoing whispers that EA is one of many major gaming studios looking to sell up. When recent, industry-shaking acquisitions involving companies such as Microsoft, Activision Blizzard, and ZeniMax/Bethesda are also taken into account, huge transactions such as the one rumored this morning are far more credible than they once might have been.\nThis breaking news story continues to unfold this morning. But, even as mere minutes pass, it seems more and more likely that the Amazon/EA purchase rumor is, at this stage, unfounded.\nhttps://twitter.com/CNBCnow/status/1563136384059285505?s=20&t=dj4RNZ6cr3wa42H9PGQNjw\nThe post Analysts shut down rumor Amazon will purchase EA today appeared first on Destructoid.",

Online features for the PC version of Dark Souls 3 went back online today.\nThe news was made known through the Dark Souls Twitter account today. The Souls team is also working to restore these features for all other Dark Souls titles, as it looks like only the third is back right now. An announcement will be made when those services are back online.\nhttps://twitter.com/DarkSoulsGame/status/1562718968086872064\nThe PC servers for Dark Souls, Dark Souls 2, and Dark Souls 3 have been offline for quite some time. They were taken down after a severe exploit was uncovered in these games. An RCE exploit in Dark Souls 3 let players run malicious code, creating a pretty serious vulnerability. Players drew attention to it, and the exploit was enough to yank down the servers for all three games on PC. Console servers, meanwhile, have stayed online.\nCalling in online assistance\nWhile we've been getting steady updates on the status of these servers, it's nice to see at least one of the games back. Online features are a pretty big part of the Souls experience, ranging from PvP to calling in assistance and leaving messages.\nMeanwhile, Elden Ring has been top-of-mind for pretty much all of 2022. The same exploit was investigated and taken care of in Elden Ring, so those servers have stayed online through the whole ordeal.\nWhile it might seem like players would still gravitate towards the newcomer in Elden Ring, it's good to have these online features back up for Dark Souls 3. Newcomers who bought into Elden Ring may wish to go back and explore earlier titles, and hopefully they'll be able to do it as originally intended.

          "description": "Here's your chance to get the latest Tomb Raider title for free\nIt's hard to keep up with all the awesome new releases in games, but sometimes, you just gotta throw it all to the wind and play an old favorite. If you're a fan of the Tomb Raider reboot series, and you're looking for a gritty adventure game to sink your teeth into, you're in luck, because Shadow of the Tomb Raider is the free game on the Epic Games Store for September.\nShadow of the Tomb Raider was originally released back in 2018 as the third game in the reboot trilogy and the twelfth mainline Tomb Raider game. The game's events take place a year after the events of its predecessor, Rise of the Tomb Raider, which came out in 2015, and finds Lara Croft racing against the clock to prevent the world from ending yet again. Arguably the darkest game in the series yet, it explores themes of descension, both through Lara's personality and the jungle itself.\n\nThe story is based on both Mayan and Aztec mythologies, and in creating the game, Square Enix devs consulted with historians to create the architecture and people of the legendary city Paititi. Fun fact: the game is still sitting at number seven on the list of most expensive games ever made, after adjusting for inflation.\nSubmerged: Hidden Depths is the other free-to-download title paired with Shadow of the Tomb Raider on the Epic Games Store. It's a relaxing exploration sim that has players uncovering the ruins of a beautiful, sunken world. If you want a more chill exploration-based gaming experience, it sounds like it's thematically fairly close to the Tomb Raider series, so it could be a fun one to try out.\nThe games are available for free download on the Epic Games Store starting September 1, so make sure to grab the roguelike \"card crawler\" Ring of Pain before it leaves the rotation next week.\nThe post Shadow of the Tomb Raider is the free game on Epic Games Store next month appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The Splatana looks pretty sick\nThe Nintendo Treehouse went live today with a special stream highlighting two upcoming Switch games. First up was Splatoon 3, which got a big showcase of not just its single-player campaign, but some of its new weapons.\nThe Treehouse team set about tackling some levels in Splatoon 3 that were largely spoiler-free, outside of general locale information. The first few segments are absolutely some familiar Splatoon multiplayer. Blast some ink, jet along the course, take out the bad guys, and reach the goal.\nWhat caught my eye right away was some of the new Splatoon 3 weapons the team spotlighted. The Splatana, an ink-launching katana, looks really great in motion. It's got different fire modes for different situations, and feels like an interesting evolution of …",

Several notable industry veterans were involved in the game's development, with music provided by composers Kenji Ito (Romancing SaGa) and Kohata Takahashi (Ridge Racer) and colorful character art daubed by Monogatari's Akio Watanabe\nAvailable on PC since 2017, the new Nintendo Switch port of the two titles will be the Bullet Soul series' first international console release. In Japan, the Bullet Soul Double Pack will also receive a physical edition, which comes complete with an art book and soundtrack CD. Unfortunately, there are currently no plans to bring this edition of the game to western shores.\nBullet Soul and Bullet Soul: Infinite Burst will launch digitally on Nintendo Switch September 29.\nThe post Shmuptastic Bullet Soul titles will launch on Switch September 29 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Dubbed Frozen Heath, this update adds new forms, challenges, and a fresh region to explore.\nFrozen Hearth takes place in an underground region that hosts The Tempering, a series of trials consisting of combat challenges and puzzles. Overcoming this contest rewards two new forms: the Killer Bee and the Mechanic, which can be used in the main game. \n\n\nOn September 13 you can buy the Frozen Hearth expansion separately for $4.99 or pick up it alongside the main game in a bundle for $27.99.  \nNobody Saved the World launched in January and became one of our early favorites of 2022. Former editor John Carson scored the game an 8.25 out of 10, writing in his review that, \n“Despite its minor shortcomings, Nobody Saves the World kept me enthralled from start to finish as I leveled my way through form ranks for the next body or ability to work with. It's most fun when unleashing devious yet approachable combat scenarios, keeping me on my toes to find the best solution to survive. Thankfully, it gave me plenty of those unrelenting loops throughout, justifying the time to save this funny little world.”",

Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. \nMetal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. \nWatch on Twitch!\nJoin me, Marcus Stewart, along with Andrew Reiner and Blake Hester, as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure.

Microsoft then declared later that day that it will not be doing the same with the Xbox Series X/S. Now, Nintendo has chimed in on the matter. \nIn a statement to Eurogamer, Nintendo reiterates a quote from president Shuntaro Furukawa, made in June, in which he stated the company has \"no plans to increase the trade price of its hardware.” Furukawa made this statement during the 82nd Annual General Meeting Shareholders that month, in which he also said: \n\"While we cannot comment on pricing strategies, we currently do not have any plans to change the price of our hardware due to inflation or increased procurement costs in each country. We will determine our future pricing strategies through careful and continued deliberations.”\nAlthough the PlayStation 5's price will remain unchanged in the U.S. (for now), both versions of the console have become more expensive in Canada, Europe, the UK, Mexico, Japan, and Australia. The price hikes have already gone into effect in those regions except Japan, which occurs on September 15. \nThe only time Nintendo significantly adjusted the price of its current consoles was last fall, when it permanently reduced the cost of the standard Switch model in the UK and Europe. Nintendo has yet to do the same in the U.S. \n[Source: Eurogamer]",

Over three minutes of gameplay footage shows off the carnage you'll unleash against adversaries, both artificial and organic. \nPlayers wield melee weapons or firearms in one hand and more, shall we say, unconventional abilities in the other. That includes electrifying targets with lightning bolts, tossing them around with a telekinesis-like power, freezing foes solid with an ice blast, or using wires to hijack machines. The action-packed video shows off how players can creatively combine their arsenal to dismantle and disembowel anything standing in their way. \n\n\nAtomic Heart was first announced in 2018 and takes place in an alternative futuristic version of the Soviet Union in 1955. Robotic technology flourished post World War 2, allowing humanity to create a high-tech utopia. Unfortunately, these mechanical helpers have started rebelling against their human creators. If that wasn’t enough, killer mutants born from secret experiments have also run amok. Players control private agent P-3, who embarks on a secret mission to get to the bottom of what’s caused this seemingly perfect society to collapse and clean up this mess. \nAtomic Heart launches this fall for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

In other years, that means fine-tuning some lesser areas of an already solid team. NHL 22 was a good-looking game, but the gameplay felt long in the tooth and in need of changes. While NHL 23 doesn’t rebuild the gameplay from the ground up, it does offer several features, tweaks, and enhancements in hopes of being better than the last iteration.\nNHL 23 represents the series’ second entry using EA’s Frostbite engine. As such, various refinements come online as the development team further familiarizes itself with the proprietary engine. EA Vancouver is also implementing several gameplay tweaks, including last-chance puck movement. This adds hundreds of new stumble anim…",

A new trailer showcases the host of new features designed to ensure the season ends with a bang.\nThe Devil In Me stars actor Jessie Buckley and follows a group of filmmakers fighting for survival in a dangerous house, a replica of H.H. Holmes’ infamous “Murder Castle.” The new trailer runs down additions such as being able to use important tools from a character inventory and extended exploration mechanics; players can freely run, jump, and climb now. Supermassive also reveals the story is over seven hours long. An online shared story lets you enjoy the experience with friends from afar, though you can explore the adventure with friends in the room in local multiplayer. \n\n\nThe Dark Pictures Anthology: The Devil In Me arrives November 18 for PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC.

First announced last fall, the game comes from Soliel Ltd, developer of the upcoming Valkyrie Elysium, and consists of Ninja Gaiden and Dead or Alive alumni. With those credentials, it's little surprise that Wanted: Dead looks absolutely bonkers. \nThe story centers on Hong Kong cop Lt. Hannah Stone, a member of the Zombie Unit. She and her squad must get to the bottom of a corporate conspiracy, but the game doesn’t appear to be nearly as serious as its premise lets on. Gameplay blends stylish swordplay with explosive gunplay as players slice and/or shoot through gang members, mercenaries, and other foes in an adventure that looks ridiculous. The release date trailer also shows off anime cutscenes, rhythm music gameplay, cute cats, and whatever else it manages to cram in. \n\n\nWanted: Dead is launching on February 14 and is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.",

He believes that this is a good thing for the gaming industry in the long run. \n“[It] is something we’re just going to see less and less of,” when discussing the idea of specific games being exclusive to a single device. “Maybe you happen in your household to buy an Xbox, and I buy a PlayStation, and our kids want to play together, and they can’t because we bought the wrong piece of plastic to plug into our television.\n“We really love being able to bring more players in reducing friction, making people feel safe, secure when they’re playing, allowing them to play with their friends, regardless of what device – I think in the long run that is good for this industry. And maybe in the short run, there’s some people in some companies that don’t love it. But I think as we get over the hump and see where this industry can continue to grow, it proves out to be true.”\nBloomberg also asked Spencer about the status of Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard acquisition, how the company will handle unions and ongoing unionization efforts happening within Activision Blizzard, and more, so be sure to check out the publication’s full story here. \n[Source: Bloomberg]\nDo you believe Spencer’s right?

We first learned of the project during the Xbox Games Showcase in June. \nThe game's art direction emulates medieval manuscript illustrations and woodcut prints while the story unfolds in 16th-century Bavaria. You play as an illustrator who becomes wrapped up in a series of murders over 25 years. You'll engage in choice-driven conversations where your decisions steer the plot and create lasting consequences in a tale that expands into a larger conspiracy. Check out the original reveal trailer below to see it in action. \n\n\nPentiment is made by a small team within Obsidian led by director Josh Sawyer.

So, it’s only fitting that Gamescom 2022 ended with two trailers (cinematic and gameplay) for the long-overdue zombie-slaying sequel. \n\n\nWe follow a chiseled survivor named Jacob as he leaves the safety of his (bloodied) condo and ventures into a Californian hellscape swarming with undead. He kills several adversaries with an empty rifle, jutting it through their rotten bodies and smashing their heads against the pavement with its wooden butt. \nThe gameplay trailer shows scenic beaches, forsaken suburbs, cratered city streets, and still-lit carnivals. In what is one of the most graphic clips I’ve ever seen at a game show, we watch as the player-character clobbers zombies with blunt objects, jump-kicks adversaries off roofs (parkour mechanics?), and shoots gasoline tanks to engulf hordes in flames.\n\n\nDead Island 2 is a first-person action RPG with six playable characters. And according to a designer who appeared onstage, the gory romp has an irreverent, pulpy tone and gameplay that’s all about “experimenting with your preferred zombie-slaying methods.”\nDead Island 2 punches and kicks its way onto PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on February 3.",

Plenty of blood is shed as humans are used as lab rats in Murkoff Corporation's Saw-like tests. In some cases, the tests just look like torture and flatout murder.\nThe game looks overly graphic, yet also brings about comparisons to BioShock's tone and storytelling conventions. It'll be interesting to see how the narrative sews all of these wild experiements together. The Outlast Trials is designed as both a single-player and cooperative experience. The player clearly is free to explore at certain points, and appears to rely on trap-like devices to fight back and escape. In one sequence, we see two players helping each other up to higher ground.\nThe footage concludes with news of a short closed beta running from October 28 to November 1.

          "description": "Telltale is known for choice-driven storytelling, and yet, the first trailer for The Expanse focuses entirely on action. As XO Camina Drummer keeps tabs on her mutinous crew, she'll also be tasked to navigate the ruins of a downed vessel on the outskirts of an asteroid belt.\nThe trailer showed Drummer space walking, dodging debris, and working her way through the massive vessel. We also see her throw a punch and grapple with someone in zero gravity. To bring this beloved science-fiction universe to life, Telltale enlisted the development talents of Deck Nine (best known for the Life is Strange series). The first pre-alpha footage looks ambitious and dark, delivering a cinematic viewpoint into an investigation riddled with death. The facial animations on the characters also look like an evolution from Telltale's previous work, yet some of the same facial features look similar.\nThe Expanse is slated to release in summer 2023.",

Believe it or not, the cult classic film is getting a game adaptation.\n\n\nThe trailer starts with a comical cinematic sequence – a teenage boy listens to loud music and plays the air guitar in his bedroom while the once-peaceful neighborhood beyond his window gets vaporized. When he notices the explosions and opens the front door, Killer Klowns with blasters reveal themselves from behind a stack of boxed pizza pies. \nKiller Klowns From Outer Space: The Game is “a crazy new take on multiplayer horror” from the executive director of Friday The 13th: The Game. Brief gameplay clips were shown, with Killer Klowns firing lasers at fleeing civilians in a carnival playspace.

However, we did note what was said by the narrator during it: \"In the cracks of reality, there exists two lives, one before the shadow and one behind the eye.\" Sounds spooky. \n\"Wyrdsong is an occult historical fantasy RPG set in a fictionalized Portugal in the middle ages,\" a press release reads. \"Players will be challenged to question both their reality and the choices they make as Wyrdsong is set to expand, question, and re-define aspects of what makes up the current Role Playing Game genre.\" \nShortly after the trailer's release, Jeff Gardiner, an ex-Bethesda Studios dev with credits in Fallout 76, Skyrim, Fallout 4, and more, posted a link on Twitter that leads to the newly-launched Something Wicked Games website. \n\"Our goal with Something Wicked Games is to utilize our independent and creative autonomy to create the next evolution of open world RPGs,\" Gardiner, who is the founder and CEO of Something Wicked Games, writes in a press release. \"Our first project, Wyrdsong, has been my dream game for some time now, and I'm thrilled to finally share it today.\" \nA press release also states the game is being developed in Unreal Engine 5.",

The boss fight features some standard point-and-shoot combat, but it also features some platforming too by way of a grapple hook-like knife tongue thing in your arsenal.

The sand arsenal is used to hunt legendary monsters in either a single-player or cooperative campaign. In the cinematic trailer, we see one hero use sand to repair a bridge, and another hero glide along the sand like she's on a hoverboard. Together, the heroes create various weapons with the sand, like a whip, to down a handful of alien dogs.

Sonic Team was open about many parts of its upcoming open-zone adventure, but one part it has remained tight-lipped on is the Sonic Frontiers release date. Today, we not only got a new trailer for Sonic Frontiers but a release date for the game too.\nRevealed today during Gamescom Opening Night Live, we now know that Sonic Frontiers launches on November 8. The trailer shown during the livestream gave us a look at a second island in the Starfall Islands: Ares Island. In stark contrast to the first island we saw – Kronos Island – Ares Island appears to be a desolate, sandy biome.\n\n\nSega and Sonic Team also revealed the pre-order bonuses and the two editions players can choose from. The standard edition of Sonic Frontiers includes the base game (physical or digital), with a pre-order bonus of the Adventurer's Treasure Box, which includes skill points, Red Seeds of Power, and Blue Seeds of Defense. The Digital Deluxe edition includes a digital copy of the game, the Explorer's Treasure Box, which includes Amy's Memory Tokens, a Portal Gear, Chaos Emerald Vault Keys, and additional shoes and gloves for Sonic, and the Digital Art Book with a 25-track digital mini soundtrack.

Glen Schofield, creative director of the new space horror adventure and one of the leading designers on the Dead Space franchise, made an appearance at Gamescom 2022. He thanked fans for the positive response and spoke about the gritty new gameplay trailer, “We’re gonna show combat and something new with a crazy ending.” \n\n\nProtagonist Jacob Lee pulls a health item with one of his abilities and proceeds to crouch-sneak his way through a group of prowling monsters. He downs one with a stab to the back and fires at another creature, stumbling toward him with tentacles squirming around its exposed belly. To top things off, he brawls with a regenerating creature adorned with cysts and sends it flying into a chainsaw-like structure in the environment. \nIn the next scene, Lee slides down a sewage drain while dodging deadly pillars along the dimly-lit channel. And in a shocking ending, reminiscent of the death scenes from Dead Space, the leading man hits a massive propeller obstructing the tunnel and gets ripped in half (I’ll spare you the gory details). Schofield warned the trailer’s ending would be wild, and it did not disappoint.\nThe Callisto Protocol launches for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on December 2.",

Publisher CI Games has long desired to bring a follow-up to market, but those plans haven't gone as planned, and the sequel bounced between several development studios before landing at Hexworks. During today's Opening Night Live festivities for Gamescom, we were treated to our first look at Hexworks' The Lords of the Fallen through a violent three-minute cinematic trailer that highlights the differences between the realms of the living and dead.\nSet one thousand years after the original, The Lords of the Fallen is designed with cooperative play in mind, allowing two players to experience uninterrupted online play. A press release describes the game as an \"expansive RPG experience filled with NPC quests, compelling characters, and rich narrative.\" The world is also said to be five times larger and interconnected. The focus is once again on soulslike combat, said to be faster than the precursor game with a touch of \"devastating magic.\"\nWhile we hear the voice of Stranger Things actor Joseph Quinn in the trailer, players will be creating their own identities.

Additionally, the system boasts new orb-like controllers with haptic feedback and adaptive triggers (like the DualSense), a single cord setup with PlayStation 5 consoles for ease-of-access, a see-through view, and better resolution/tracking – we're talking two different modes of visual fidelity. \nAccording to our very own Marcus Stewart, \"VR mode displays VR content in a 360-degree view in 4000 x 2040 HDR video format (2000 x 2040 per eye) and 90Hz/120Hz frame rate.

The game starts when the daughter of an American billionaire is kidnapped by a group of Vietnamese terrorists. Then, it’s up to Major Howard Toliver, ex-Marine and highly decorated Vietnam veteran, to gather a deadly team for the dangerous mission of rescuing her. He recruits six prison inmates serving life sentences for a chance at a full presidential pardon.\nKeep the body count rising to survive five territories by playing as each Soldier Boy (and Girl),\nbut beware and don’t waste a “friendly” since they provide vital survival information!\nScummVM currently supports the English release of the game (which is the only one we know about) and features more responsive controls than the original. We couldn't find a demo but there is a trailer. Please contact us if you have a demo or any other release.\nTo play the game with ScummVM, you will need a daily development build.
