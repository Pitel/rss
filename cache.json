Which is nice. Better than highlighting the dull ones.\nOnce again there are discounts of up to 75% on various titles, some of them rather good. A quick look at the EU eShop shows a mere 2869(!) games on some form of sale at the time of writing, although not all of those are part of this promotion.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Apparently, it intends to reveal a number of projects that have been in development for several years and will pave the way for the company's future.

          "description": "Diablo has, for good reasons, become a shorthand for describing the flavour of gothic, grimdark fantasy setting in games, where pus-filled demonic hordes and rotting, undead corpses scour a hellish cathedral looking for unwitting adventurers. For all its wretched decay, however, the series still feels like an indulgence to be savoured. Its clickiness and abhorrent sights make the games endlessly gratifying, and masterful butchery of fiends eases most players into a comfortable rhythm. And part of that appeal lies in the macabre yet captivating fantasy it so deftly peddles — all that blood, gore and guts really make for a grisly setting that’s nearly impossible to look away from.\r\n\n\nTainted Grail: Conquest conveys the same sense of blight and doom in its dark fantasy universe — one that’s a reimagining of Arthurian legends — but also ups the ante with a huge wallop of Slay The Spire’s roguelike, deck-building elements.\nRead more",

I'd try to find my way down to the surface, but always at the risk of glitching straight through and ending up in Snake World, where monstrous serpents emerged from darkened kitchens.\r\n\n\r\nSomewhere between these two poles lay the realm of the Animals, not that they were really animals, but clouds of eyelash-thin mandible, grot and sparkle, like rotten food on the point of becoming a school of tropical fish. I loved Animal World. I used to spend hours trying to mind-hack my way into it.

Which is a shame, since it’s a rather unique title in their respective careers, and it charts new waters for these cult directors.\r\n\n\nWorld’s End Club was the first game the pair released since forming their own studio, Too Kyo Games, and can best be described as a bizarre but intriguing blend of platforming and death games, starring a cast of prepubescent children way too young to be fixing the world or dealing with cults.

It is a very big cave, and every night a huge colony of bats come screaming out of the entrance. They spend the day clinging to the ceiling of this big cave, and all their bat poo falls down and has become a towering heap carpeting the floor.\nBut then David said look, the carpet is moving. And it turns out that the whole bottom of the cave is covered in cockroaches and giant centipedes. And if ever a small baby bat or an old injured bat falls, it is eaten alive by this hoard of chittering insects. This nature documentary haunted me, for it was the worst thing I could imagine happening.\nAnyway, Nate has been to that cave and he's going to tell us all about it for this episode of our supporters only podcast, The Nate Files.

I'm not one for looking forward. If a game's not out yet it tends to disappear from my mind, making room for a hundred other recent releases in this age of plenty. That I've less interest in looking back over this year than I do pondering the next suggests that maybe we're in for something special in the coming twelve months.

He’s the kind of archetypal director whose work I’ve been exposed to in bits and pieces without ever actually sitting down to watch one of his films in full. All of that is to say that, upon starting Alfred Hitchcock - Vertigo the game, I was in no position to judge whether it was a faithful adaptation of the film or to recognize all but the most obvious illusions to Hitchcock’s body of work (look, birds!). That’s okay, though, because as it turns out, Vertigo is an original story based on a collage of Hitchcockian concepts, not a direct adaption of the 1958 film by the same name.\nVertigo the game follows author Ed Miller as he grapples with a debilitating case of vertigo–a condition that leaves him unable to stand as the world appears to spin around him–and paralyzing guilt over the death of his daughter and her mother, Faye, after their car falls off a bridge into a ravine below. With Ed bed ridden, it’s up to Dr. Julia Lomas, psychologist and psychiatrist, and Sheriff Nick Reyes to unravel the mystery of what really happened, and whether Faye and his daughter even exist. My thoughts on how Vertigo goes about telling this story are... complicated. \nRead more",

Games that were delayed by the pandemic last year finally got their due in 2021, but in turn many of the releases we were expecting this year have inevitably slipped into 2022. The pandemic has affected games of all sizes this year, and I don't think it will go down in the history books as one of our all-time greats. There were still plenty of fantastic games that came out this year, mind, and we're still counting down our absolute favourites over in our Advent Calendar. \nThat said, I do think 2021 will prove to be a pivotal year for RPS - and not just because I stole Graham's key card and changed the locks on the front door of the Treehouse. It's been a year of immense change here at the site, so I wanted to take some time to reflect on everything that's happened this year, and look forward to what we've got in store for 2022.\nRead more",

The original's bombing mission sequence, which sees Cloud and co. blow up a planet-killing mako reactor in the industrialised hellhole of Midgar's city centre, was already one of the Final Fantasy series' best openers, but here we get to really luxuriate in every last detail of its twenty-four-year glow-up. Director Tetsuya Nomura may have a reputation for excess in JRPG circles (both in his tangled storylines and his passion for buckles and belts), but in FF7R that tendency toward indulgence has been applied with deadly, laser-like precision. \nRead more",

The suit started in December 2020 with investors primarily upset with the fact that the console version was in such a state, claiming that CDP hadn't been honest about the game and its prospects. CDP say that the proposed settlement terms make clear that though they are paying out, this \"does not imply admission of any responsibility\".\nRead more",

More recently, Nvidia went a step further, quietly launching a brand new version of the RTX 2060 that doubles its VRAM to 12GB.\r\n\n\r\nEmphasis on the “quietly”, mind – even if you’ve been regularly checking for available GPU stock or perusing our graphics cards deals guide, you probably won’t have even noticed there’s a 12GB RTX 2060 knocking around.

          "description": "The Gunk might not be the most sophisticated name in the universe for a gooey black jelly that pulses with an ominous red light, but goodness it sure is appropriate. As space haulers Rani and Becks touch down on a forgotten planet in search of a strange energy signal, the place is absolutely gummed up with the stuff. It oozes and throbs in the caves, plains and rivers of this once vibrant landscape, and the urge to suck it all up into Rani's chunky power glove (a literal hand vac in this case) is overwhelmingly strong. After all, when it turns the ground black and saps the world of all its colour, this is one case of Extremely Bad Vibes you'll want to remedy as soon as possible. \nYour reward for scooping up all the gunk in any given area is the kind of graphical wizardry video games do best. A burst of light, a shruum of sound, and the world is instantly transformed back to its former glory. Despite its gloopy namesake, The Gunk is frequently stunning, its soft pastels and coral-esque flora showing such an eye for jaw-dropping visuals that it's hard to believe this is SteamWorld developer Image & Form's first ever 3D video game. If this is what they've been holding back on all these years, then their upcoming action adventure SteamWorld Headhunter should be a real treat for the old eyeballs. That said, while Image & Form have clearly navigated their 2D to 3D transition from an art perspective, their typical flair for adding their own spin to different genres has been less successful. There's a lot to like about this 3D action platformer, but it's missing that spark to really make it sing.\nRead more",

Using the now iconic tagline \"finish the fight,\" Bungie created Halo 3 under the agreement that it would part ways with Microsoft after a new set of Halo games. The third game was the first of this batch, and its creation suffered from internal studio conflicts, including creative heads walking out mid-development. How did Bungie cope with matching Halo 2's quality, migrating to a new platform in the Xbox 360, and delivering a conclusion that lived up to expectations? Tune in to find out. \nJoin hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and Game Informer video editor Alex Stadnik (@Studnik76) as we unpack the history and impact of Master Chief's grand sequel. And for more Halo, be sure to check out our definitive ranking of every Halo game.\nCheck out the rest of our podcast on the Video Gameography hub.

For most of us, that means thinking about how to make 2022 an even better year than the last with some New Year’s resolutions. Every year when this time rolls around, I make big plans.

As for what, Team Ninja director Fumihiko Yasuda said fans can look forward to future titles such as an action game set in the Three Kingdom era and another game that he’s actually directing. \nFinally, Fatal Frame producer Yosuke Kikuchi said that in 2022, “his team will challenge the development of something that they have never done before,” according to Twinfinite’s translation and that while it will be a long time before it’s formally announced, the studio is excited to get started. \nPerhaps 2022 will bring a new Nioh game to consoles and PC, or maybe even a new Fatal Frame, especially since the last one was released in 2015.

We recently had the chance to play a mildly amusing Cobra Kai video game from developer Flux, and now we can show our love for the show with new skins in Fortnite.\nSadly none of the characters from the Netflix show are represented in likeness, but their schools are. This means you can suit up as generic characters in the styles of Cobra Kai, Eagle Fang, and Miyagi-Do. Each character you purchase for 800 V-Bucks can change to any of the three schools. You have a variety to pick from, such as Shuto Striker, Mat Master, Keri Commander, Kata Captain, Dojo Defender, and more. You can get five styles in the Karate Ko Bundle, and another five in the Dojo Showdown Bundle. Both sell for 2,000 V-Bucks.\nStrike first. Strike hard. No mercy.\npic.twitter.com/4YHsbpnyan\nDecember 31, 2021\n \n\nThe only recognizable character is Agent Jones, who, like the other characters, can switch between dojos. He retails for 800 V-Bucks.\nThe best item offered is The Crane Kick emote that plays a clip from Joe Esposito's song \"You're The Best Around.\" This item will set you back 300 V-Bucks, or you can get it in a bundle with The Teachings of Miyagi back bling, Cobra Coin back bling, Dojo Logo harvesting tool, and Cobra's Curse harvesting tool. That bundle is 1,500 V-Bucks.\nThe Fortnite store has also been updated today with a variety of 2022-themed items, with many festive characters returning for New Year's celebration.",

Read below for some of the most surprising games Steam players invested their time into. \nStarting out, news games like Valheim, New World, and the first season of Halo Infinite's multiplayer top the list with more than 200,000 peak players. However, some old stand-bys also make appearances, such as Grand Theft Auto V, Dota 2, and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Perhaps most surprising is Cyberpunk 2077 appearing in the top spot – somewhat shattering the illusion that CD Projekt Red's most recent game was an overall disaster. At the very least, a ton of people are still playing Cyberpunk more than a year later. \nWith over 100,000 peak players, Capcom's excellent Resident Evil Village makes an appearance, as does Farming Simulator 22 and Battlefield 2042. Games you might expect to see here are also accounted for, such as Among Us, Rocket League, Destiny 2, and Dead by Daylight. \nBack 4 Blood, Phasmophobia, Sea of Thieves, and Final Fantasy XIV all stand out in the over 60,000 peak players listing. And not to be forgotten, Left 4 Dead 2, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, Fallout 4, Dying Light, and Loop Hero all had big years, being played by more than 30,000 people in 2021. \n While we're here recognizing video game achievements in 2021, why not check out Game Informer's picks for the 10 best games of the year?

In the olden days, we’d have new MMOs hitting all the time. Today, the lines are blurred where many games now take features and aspects that were once relegated to the genre proper, and few new offerings in the classic space ever appear. New World was awesome in a few ways here. Not only did it seek to break into a space that’s ruled by titans that have been around for eons, but it did so with a good deal of gusto, willing to explore features and mechanics that are anything but safe.

Thanks to Kotaku for the story. \nOn December 27, the Japanese TV channel ran a three-hour special revealing the ranking. The list was also posted on Twitter by user @MLZ0902.\nOf the 100 games on the list, there are a few surprising stand-outs. Sucker Punch's Ghost of Tsushima snagged a spot, coming in at number 66, as did Minecraft, ranked number 20. Both versions of Persona 5 – the original base game and the expanded edition, Persona 5 Royal – were on the list in spots 42 and 93, respectively.

Sure, the Marios and the Zeldas are great too, but there’s something special about loading up on some great indie games to play in bed or on the go. 2021 was a strong year for indies across the board, but if you’re curious which games attracted the most eyeballs on Switch, Nintendo’s got you covered.\nThe company released a brief video showing off the best-selling indie games on Switch. Sadly, the montage doesn’t reveal actual sales numbers nor does it rank these titles in any kind of order based on performance. Apparently, all we need to know is that they outsold the gazillion other indie games to hit the eShop in 2021, which is still an impressive feat. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nIf you don’t feel like watching the video, the best-selling indie games on Switch in 2021 are (in alphabetical order):\nAxiom Verge 2\nCurse of the Dead Gods\nCyber Shadow\nDoki Doki Literature Club Plus\nEastward\nEnder Lilies: Quietus of the Knights\nIslanders: Console Edition\nLittlewood\nRoad 96\nSlime Rancher: Plortable Edition\nSpelunky 2\nStick Fight: The Game\nSubnautica + Subnautica Below Zero\nTetris Effect: Connected\nUnpacking\nThat’s a strong list of quality games, so it’s reassuring to see that they’ve earned a buck on top of garnering critical praise. I'd personally recommend giving just about all of them a look. \nIf you need a guide to other great indie games from 2021 across all platforms, check out our handy list of the best-reviewed independent games of the year.\nWhich of these games have you played on Switch?

But unlike most years, a ton of the games we're excited about already have a release date, coming just a couple of months after the prime holiday season. February 2022 is currently looking like one of the most stacked months in gaming ever, reminding us of the biggest and best weeks of the fall.

First, let's take a look at what we have to look forward to this February.\nThe month starts out strong with the Life is Strange Remasted Collection on February 1, followed shortly behind by Dying Light 2 Stay Human, Techland's open-world zombie RPG, on February 4.

With so much new Batman material to pull from, it's amazing that toy manufacturers are still turning to 2009's Batman: Arkham Asylum video game for new action figures.\nMcFarlane Toys is the latest company to create an awesome (and terrifying) figure from this dark game. Falling into McFarlane's DC Multiverse line, fans will soon be able to get their hands on the monstrous and hulking Titan Joker action figure. If you played the game, you know The Joker ingested a chemical compound called Titan to try take down Batman. That plan didn't go so well, which becomes a plot point for the sequels.\nMcFarlane shared a first look at this mega-scale figure on Instagram:\nOther than this tease, McFarlane hasn't shared any details regarding release time frame or pricing. The Batman figure that Titan Joker is holding retailed for roughly $25 when it released a couple of years ago. The Titan figure should be considerably more than that.\nMcFarlane Toys has a long history of making awesome video game collectibles. You can check out some of the company's other offerings here.",

          "description": "Yoko Taro is known as the mastermind behind the Nier series (and its predecessor, Drakenguard) though he may be putting the former behind him for good. The eccentric game director with the bizarro mask has teased that he’s putting Nier behind him for good.\nIn a holiday message recorded on December 22, Taro, along with Nier producer Yosuke Saito and series composer Keiichi Okabe, discussed the last year as well as the sales success of Nier Replicant ver. 1.22474487139 (which has pushed past a million copies, according to the team). The update comes off as a friendly chat between old friends, as they bounce between discussing traveling abroad to meet fans, want they want for Christmas, and complaining about shoulder problems. \nBut when Saito asks Taro if he has anything new to share regarding the Nier series, Taro bluntly replies “Nah, nothing!” When Saito asks if he’s fine with not doing anything more with YoRHa, Taro half-jokingly declares “We announced it here today folks! The Nier series is now finished!”  You can watch the video by clicking the embedded tweet below. \nYOKO TARO said it here, NieR is finished 😱\npic.twitter.com/FPCSyLiZKj\nDecember 22, 2021\nOf course, Taro could easily be kidding and Saito immediately calls him out on it. Taro admits abandoning Nier could be a lie, saying “But … you never know …I might do more if I get a big ‘ol pile of money...”\nSo is Nier done for good? My money is on “probably not, but don’t expect anything new for a long time.” Especially if Taro does indeed receive bags of cash. In October, Taro released Voice of Cards, a turn-based RPG revolving around cards (but isn’t actually a deck-builder). He’s got some “free time” on his hands now that it and Nier Replicant are out the door, and we’re intrigued to see what he’s got up his sleeve next.",

He later became an unforgettable, bombastic broadcaster for CBS, Fox, ABC, and NBC, covering and commentating on NFL games every week.

It's been revealed in a communication to investors that Remedy Games has developed a relationship with Tencent for a global license, development, and distribution deal for a new cooperative multiplayer game currently codenamed Vanguard.\nVanguard is said to be a free-to-play, co-op, PvE shooter that's an IP owned by Remedy and will combine \"Remedy’s narrative expertise and action gameplay into an immersive multiplayer experience.\" The deal will apparently have Tencent localize and publish the game for \"selected Asian markets,\" while Remedy will handle development and distribution globally in other territories. It also allows Tencent the license to create a mobile version that the two entities have \"agreed on a separate revenue sharing scheme for.\nHere's Remedy Entertainment CEO, Tero Virtala's statement on the partnership:\nWe don't know much else about Vanguard other than it's being developed for consoles and PC using the Unreal Engine.

His exploits on the battlefield back up his size – a one-man army capable of turning the tide of war. We've seen how resourceful and powerful he can be in story sequences and advertisements, but many of those dynamic actions don't cross over to when the player controls him. He can swing big hammers, pilot any vehicle, and run and gun with swift grace, but so can most combatants in the game. Prior Halo gameplay hasn't made him look like the super soldier we envision.

After visiting Australia in the third installment and touring Great Britain in the fourth, we’ve known for some time that the newest and fifth entry in the long-running racer would transport us to the idyllic environs of Mexico. But it wasn’t until we got the final game in our hands that it became clear; Playground Games has gone above and beyond, crafting one of the best looking new-gen games on the market, and filling it with some of the most entertaining racing experiences in memory.\nA good opener can go a long way to setting a game’s tone, and Forza Horizon 5 nails the landing – both figuratively and literally. In a rollicking opening sequence, one vehicle after another goes parachuting out from a cargo plane, dropping into various locales across Mexico. In just a few short minutes, the game makes a case for its tremendous potential, showing off everything from muddy offroad races through rivers and jungles, to blazing street races in supercars most of us will never drive in real life.

          "description": "Ever wanted to play a 4v1 asymmetrical horror game where four survivors face off against a killer? Wait, that’s called Dead by Daylight. Propnight essentially combines the asymmetrical antics of Dead by Daylight with PropHunt, which creates a different experience entirely, as survivors can turn into books, chairs, hot dogs, crates, giant pianos and stuffed bears, and basically anything else in the environment. While the game has a lot of various features and mechanics that players will recognize from Dead by Daylight such as the survivors working on various objectives to open the exit gates, the game has a decidedly different tone. While games can still get plenty sweaty, it’s hard to take things seriously when players are possessing giant pigs and jumping on the killer’s head, stunning them, and then hopping into a backpack and hiding on a bookshelf.\nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nThere are no perks to sift through on either side of the equation, so whether you’re the survivor or the killer, props are the key element for success or failure. Some props, like giant pigs or rolling wheels, are easy to spot and chase, but others like diminutive soda bottles or logs can blend in seamlessly with the environment. If you turn a corner as a survivor under a chase and spot something you can turn into, the killer could easily run by your location completely oblivious to you standing still right there. Props also let you get around the environment in far more dynamic ways than as a human, being able to execute flittering swoops, jumps, and other fare around the board with verticality. Of course, the killer isn’t defenseless here, as they have their own tools. In fact, one killer, The Imposter, can actually pretend to be a survivor and turn into props as well. Talk about deception!\nIf you’re looking for a bizarre take on existing mechanics, this is one you might want to check out.\nPropnight is currently available on PC.",
