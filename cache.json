In the '90s almost every Saturday morning ad break featured a Hot Wheels commercial braying out superlative adjectives over thrashy rock solos. Invariably, two pearly-toothed, spiky-haired kids would grin as their miniature cars jostled for pole position, giving each other a thumbs-up after a totally tubular crash. All we ever wanted was a simple orange loop ‚Äî because the loop was the coolest gravity-defying thing ever ‚Äî but we never got one because the Super Nintendo was a life priority. We did manage to try one once, though, and pinged that car down the straight at full speed, ripping up the lip, only for it to soar off and go clattering across the ground. While you can still spectacularly succumb to gravity in Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged, if you blast the accelerator for all its worth you‚Äôll coast that loop through an elating 360 degrees.\nHere, the world of collectible racing cars has been virtually recreated in a splendidly inventive fashion. What‚Äôs striking about Unleashed 2 is the creativity that‚Äôs been put into its various modes, featuring clever ideas that don't just lean on existing tropes, but dig into the fascinating meta of miniature racing within giant, real-world environments.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "\"Do you hear screaming, or am I having another one of my episodes?\".\nA little less than ten years ago, a port of Borderlands 2 famously launched for Sony‚Äôs ailing PS Vita to middling reception. The fact that a then-current game could run at all on a portable was remarkable, but the flat visuals, crashing, and consistently sub 30 FPS performance relegated it to more of a novelty than a version that people would be comfortable playing for hours on end. When Borderlands 3 Ultimate Edition was announced for the Switch, there was a lot of discourse that history would be repeating itself here, and this wasn‚Äôt helped by the general lack of footage leading up to release. Fortunately, any such fears can now be put to rest. Borderlands 3 runs shockingly well on the Switch, bringing over the full, crazy experience in all its glory for portable play.\nBorderlands 3 picks up about seven years after the events of Borderlands 2 and follows the interstellar adventures of familiar Crimson Raiders like Lilith, Claptrap, and Ellie alongside newcomers like Ava and Lorelei. The gang this time around faces off against the Calypso Twins, a godlike sibling duo who have united the bandit clans of Pandora under a cult called the Children of the Vault. Notably, Tyreen Calypso has the ability to leech power from other creatures, and if she‚Äôs allowed to absorb the powers of the ancient beasts residing in the Vaults hidden across each planet, she‚Äôll become virtually unstoppable.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

One was a mind-bogglingly complex, almost military-grade-looking briefcase stuffed full of switches, nozzles and buttons, and the other was an impossibly cute cardboard flip book and projector combo that let its cartoon hero Bib bound across the 3D paper environments to find a way home.

          "description": "I love it when game names do what they say on the tin, but I love it even more when they contain hidden depths behind that initial simplicity. Hermit And Pig is indeed a game about a reclusive old hermit and his truffle-hunting pig, but this charming adventure RPG also has one of the most involving turn-based battle systems I've come across in a while. \nTaking place in first person a la Dragon Quest, Hermit must deal with all sorts of mad and angry wildlife as he hunts for his favourite forest mushrooms, and their scowling (and endearingly daft) expressions are just the tip of this excellent iceberg. For you're not just choosing from a list of moves and watching them play out onscreen. Oh no. Each attack also comes with its own three-button fighting combo, and you'll need to input the right one (often at the right time) to deal the most damage. It's a brilliant system, making Hermit And Pig easily one of this year's highlights from EGX's Leftfield Collection. \nRead more",

          "description": "If you played a videogame at all in 2022, I hope it was Roadwarden. A blend of RPG and visual novel from Polish developer Moral Anxiety, it cast you as lonesome wayfarer maintaining the paths and investigating the mysteries or grievances of a thinly populated wilderness setting. It's a game of immense feeling, craft and cleverness, inspired by table-top games, which puts hoarier ideas about videogame role-playing through the wringer. In the world of Roadwarden, there's no grinding for XP or mindless loot-crafting treadmill. Knowledge, empathy and insight are worth far more than material wealth or wielding the shiniest axe. Quests can hinge on something as minute as your ear for dialects or knowing the correct form of address. And each village along the trail is a world in itself.\r\n\n\r\nMoral Anxiety's Windy Meadow - which actually dates back to before development of Roadwarden, but has been substantially remastered since the latter's release - essentially narrows the focus to one of those villages. Out today, it's a quietly gorgeous visual novel in which you follow several characters in different timeframes, building up a layered understanding of one and the same setting, with scene transitions plotted on a beautiful pixelart map screen.\n Read more",

From the Minecraft Live footage this weekend, Trial Chambers look like an evolution of the game's old buried fortresses, with some nifty new flourishes in the shape of copper bulb blocks that slowly give off less and less light, and new Trial Spawners, which generate a certain number of hostile mobs based on things like the number of players in your party.\r\n\n \nRead more",

But having played a timed 20-minute demo of it at this year's EGX, I'll hold my hands up and say, yep, I'm the one who's been slapped in the face with a giant custard pie here, as Loco Motive is genuinely really quite good, folks, and I'm pleased to report the good old days are still very much alive and kicking.

With just a single squeeze of the trigger, he sets to work, moving his arm automatically to neatly attack each neighbouring blob without any further prompting or manual aiming. All I need to focus on is getting him close enough to the gunge and he'll take care of the rest. Sure, it's perhaps not quite as involved as your PowerWash Sims and other polish em ups, but the combination of Loddlenaut's lo-fi visuals, comforting score and surprisingly soothing controller rumble all work to give it its own kind of zen-like charm - and it was enough to make me forget the surrounding din of the EGX Rezzed Zone for a very enjoyable 20 minutes or so.\nRead more",

You've got a whole weekend of free demos to try, and we've knocked back a few to regurgitate into your open mouths as suggestions for what to try first. Plus, we've been playing a few current games, and have some juicy recommendations of non-game things.\nRead more",

          "description": "I'm honestly a little surprised by how much I'm enjoying Star Trek: Infinite. It is not the ultimate Star Trek strategy game, but nor is it a bog standard 4X strategy in an unfortunate 80s leotard. \"Lets you play your own Star Trek story\" is a fair summary of what it's about, even if the bulk of that story in practical terms is building space stations to claim territory, and filling up planets with farms, cities, and empire-specific labour camps, forums, and whatever hippie garbage the feds have. Of course, it has the advantage of riding the coattails of already-established fiction and maybe that's cheating a little, but the result is a sort of grand 4X that in most regards I've enjoyed more the longer I played it.\nRead more",

The game's first story DLC expansion, Haus, amps up the weirdness of the environments by transporting you to a \"surreal, psycho-horror dreamscape\" in blissful Malibu.\nThere are flashes of Glass Onion and The Menu here, but I was reminded just as much of the eerier parts of Bioshock, that underwater monument to crackpot billionaires with far too much time on their hands.

We thought the original was average and largely forgettable, so how does the new LOTF stack up against it nine years later? Well, it's definitely going to appeal to more folks by being a fairly enjoyable soulslike that ticks most checkboxes, and that rises above most of the competition by popping a magic lantern in your hands.\nRaise a light to the dark fantasy world and it'll reveal a more dribbly parallel universe you can warp between at almost any time. This spooky lantern might open up some cool realm-hopping twists on your grim adventure, and the game as a whole might instil a sense of exploration sure to please souls fans after a familiar hit of uncertain peril, but its finer details chip away at your patience. It's not long before your tentative pushes through horrible towns and creaky walkways soon give way to wild sprint finishes born from pure frustration.\nRead more",

          "description": "Whereas most games begin by getting you into the action as quickly as possible, Saltsea Chronicles opens with a quick note about its save system. It's a small, but important detail in this story-driven adventure game, as throughout its nine-to-ten-hour run time, you'll be faced with various decisions about where your crew of post-apocalyptic drifters will explore next, as they set sail in search of their missing captain Maja. By choosing one island at the end of every chapter, you'll naturally miss out on visiting another - and with 14 locales to explore in total in the Saltsea archipelago (and only 12 chapters to do it in), each playthrough has the potential to end up being quite different from the last.\nBut up front it tells you \"There are no wrong choices, only your choices\" in Saltsea Chronicles, and that ultimately this is a tale about \"tracing different pathways\" using its clever branching save system. While you can, of course, play it through from start to finish in a single swoop, you also have the option to purloin its additional save slots to take those roads less travelled (presented here as delightful, wiggling seaweed tendrils), and all without overwriting your existing adventure. Immediately, that sense of FOMO is dispelled, and instead of worrying about 'seeing everything' or making sure you get a 'good' playthrough, you can simply enjoy its enthralling tale of high seas soap opera, curious exploration, and the knotty drama that comes with trying to forge connections in an increasingly fragmented world. It's a journey well worth taking, even if what lies at the end of it didn't quite come together in the way I'd hoped.\nRead more",

In this deceptively Civilization-esque 4X strategy game, all player turns unfold simultaneously, once you've decided what to build or research, where to move your units, and so on. As Oxide Games design director Michelle Menard tells me over Zoom, this approach takes inspiration from an ancient military simulator, Kriegsspiel, which was devised by the Prussian army officer George Leopold von Reisswitz, aka the \"father of wargaming\", in the mid-1800s. \r\n\n\r\n\"It was to train their generals, it was a legit apparatus of war, it was not for funsies,\" says Menard. \"And they basically created this massive table that had a modular terrain system. At first they used sand, but that was kind of messy, [and so] they developed a system where they had interchangeable tiles, like hills and valleys and plateaus. \r\n\n\r\n\"They would build out this table, literally drop a sheet down the middle, and it'd be like, OK, you guys on each side, you can't see what the other person's doing. There was an actual game master, who was the referee who you would report your moves to. He would then re-set up the board and basically call people back into the room and be like, tada! It's the next turn - let's see what people did. Was it what you expected?\" \r\n\n \nRead more",

They can also make already-affordable kit even more of a bargain, as is the case with the Logitech G413 SE mechanical keyboard: a snip at ¬£60. \r\n\n\r\nThis has been on our best gaming keyboards list for a while now, specifically for delivering all the satisfying finger-feel (and durability) of a true mechanical board with a pricing that puts it closer to high-end membrane and hybrid switch models. The G413 SE employs the bumpy 'tactile' style of mech switches, so it‚Äôs good for accurate typing, and it‚Äôs easily fast and agile enough for gaming duty as well. I actually ended up using this as my main keyboard for a while, despite having more expensive linear-switch boards piled up in a nearby cupboard, and I‚Äôd extra-extra-recommend it at this price.\r\n\n \nRead more",

That these are among my absolute favourite Total War moments may say something about the level of satisfaction to be found elsewhere in the series‚Äô strategy sandboxes, at times as robust as ancient oaks, others as stale as ancient wotsits. It may be an admission on both our parts that, for all its simulated complexity, Total War is really for people who‚Äôd be just as happy playing with those little elasticated catapults and plastic castles, if we could still sit on the floor without our pelvises crumbling into soup mix.  \r\n\n\nTotal War: Pharaoh, which I will acknowledge once and once only as being officially stylised PHARAOH, is almost certainly the most systemically interesting and quality-of-life-full a Total War game has been at launch for a very long time. Three Kingdoms has better diplomacy, Warhammer has unequivocally better goblins, but none are as refreshingly cavalier and passionately thorough with the blueprint of what Total War has the potential to be. CA Sofia should be immensely proud of what they‚Äôve done here, but the realities of Total War‚Äôs ridiculous release schedule now clearly mean that even a studio as willing and able to innovate so much in such a short time frame are effectively prevented from producing a genuinely exciting strategy game. I‚Äôd love to tell you these new plastic castles are more fun than your old ones, but there‚Äôs not even any catapults.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The Meta Quest 2 was the ideal gaming VR package: powerful and accessible enough to provide easy, convincing immersion, while also staying highly affordable. Nonetheless, Meta‚Äôs sudden fixation on creating a legless version of Second Life did have me worried about the future trajectory of its VR hardware. What daft gimmickry would their next headset come festooned with, and what would it mean for the future of the Quest as a gaming device?\r\n\n\r\nWith the Meta Quest 3, we have the answer. And the truth is, Meta‚Äôs latest headset does have a whiff of Metaverse about it. Dubbed a \"mixed reality\" device, its raison d‚Äô√™tre is to break down the barrier between reality and the virtual world. While mixed reality is an angle I‚Äôm not wholly sold on from a gaming perspective, crucially, the features that make it a mixed reality device are useful even if you don‚Äôt want to hold a meeting in your office with a bunch of bisected Sims. Moreover, they‚Äôre built into a headset that is more powerful, more comfortable, and generally better than the Meta Quest 2.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Or at least, that's my summary of his thoughts following the recent announcement on Xitter that Alan Wake 2 will have a performance mode on PS5 and Xbox Series X, allowing consoleers for whom responsiveness is a priority to eke a higher frame-rate out of a game \"built from the beginning as a 30fps experience focusing on visuals and ambiance.\"\nPuha has subsequently been chatting to press about the creation of the mode and Alan Wake 2's visuals at large. In what has become a time-honoured ceremony for any AAA game developer a month or two before release, he took a moment to observe that focussing on frame-rate vs resolution is missing the wood for the trees.

You are, indeed, being buried alive. The person burying you is your girlfriend, who waves aside your protests that you aren't dead yet, pointing out that this is exactly what a dead person would say if they were trying to avoid being buried. Can't fault the logic.\nClick the downward arrow below the animated image of your girlfriend burying you alive and you'll discover a murky fungal blackscreen where cartoon rats periodically try to eat you, unless you click to get rid of them. Below that, there's a kind of Alice in Wonderland-style alcove in which a tousled lady with a rat on her shoulder reassures you that being buried alive ain't so bad. As she points out, \"underground is like, the only place to escape capitalism, plus it's nice and cool\". Again, I can't fault the logic. Then she offers to play cards with you. The cards in question have rats doodled on them, including a wonderfully festive rodent Joker. There is passing mention of a \"rat god\".\nRead more",

          "description": "‚ÄúBaldur‚Äôs Gate II set the model, and I obviously loved that model,‚Äù says James Ohlen. ‚ÄúBut there were a ton of people at BioWare who didn‚Äôt like it.‚Äù During leadership meetings over the course of the Canadian designer‚Äôs 22 years at the RPG studio, he‚Äôd sometimes feel totally outnumbered when talking about the importance of story. ‚ÄúGame developers don‚Äôt get into the industry to create stories, they get into the industry to create games,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAnd so there‚Äôs this conflict between game developers and story - my entire career it's been a constant fight.‚Äù\r\n\n\r\nOhlen picked his side early. He was telling BioWare stories even before he joined the company. The meeting of Minsc and Boo, one of the most enduring partnerships in PC gaming, came about in a tabletop Dungeons & Dragons game he ran as a teenager. Then a comic book store manager, he took advantage of his premises to guide no fewer than three concurrent D&D groups through their campaigns. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt really have much of a life outside of Dungeons & Dragons,‚Äù he says. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "There's a side mission in Cyberpunk 2077 that involves abducting a notorious union-breaker. One wonders if any of the people who worked on that have joined the union founded by CD Projekt RED employees this month. The union is part of the larger Polish worker's organisation OZZ Inicjatywa Pracownicza, and comes in response to CD Projekt's firing around 100 employees in July due to \"overstaffing\". Its membership is anonymous and open to people in the industry who aren't employed by the Witcher and Cyberpunk studio, but are thinking about forming a union in their own workplace.\r\n\n\r\n\"We started talking about unionizing after the 2023 wave of layoffs when 9% of Reds (that is roughly 100 people) were let go,\" reads an official FAQ from the group. \"This event created a tremendous amount of stress and insecurity, affecting our mental health and leading to the creation of this union in response. Having a union means having more security, transparency, better protection, and a stronger voice in times of crisis.\"\r\n\n \nRead more",

The proceeds of this month's bundle go to support International Medical Corps and Direct Relief. If you pay at least $13, you can add STASIS: Bone Totem, Bendy and the Ink Machine, Bendy and the Dark Revival, Alan Wake Collector‚Äôs Edition, Hidden Deep, Tormented Souls, Pathologic 2, and Moons of Madness to your library on Steam.\n\n\nPlus, it's the Alan Wake Collector‚Äôs Edition. This version includes not only the base game but also a pair of special episodes called ‚ÄúThe Signal‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Writer.\" There's also developer commentary, an illustrated PDF book, and a soundtrack with nearly an hour of fully mastered audio tracks composed by Petri Alanko, Old Gods of Asgard, and Poets of the Fall. \n\n\nIt‚Äôs just in time for the sequel, Alan Wake 2, on October 27 for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC via the Epic Games Store. The game's director, Sam Lake, also recently confirmed his plans for free DLC at this year's EGX. That is to say, catch up now before your Alan Wake to-do list grows too long. \n\n\nIn addition to experiencing (for the first time, no less) the Pacific Northwest adventures of Alan Wake, being able to add both games in the Bendy and the Ink Machine duology to my library makes this bundle one I don‚Äôt want to pass up. I still haven‚Äôt been able to play Bendy and the Dark Revival, so this might be my best opportunity. \n\nThe post Alan Wake joins Humble Bundle discounts just in time for Halloween sequel appeared first on Destructoid.",

Naruto and Naruto Shippuden have been home to some of the most iconic opening themes, and they're on the way to the next game. Bandai Namco announced new DLC for Naruto x Boruto Ultimate Ninja Storm Connections adding five fan-favorite songs along with some in-game items. \n\n\nHere's a sample, so go ahead and start belting out your best anime theme song karaoke.¬†\n\n\n\n\nThe new in-game items include the Ninja Info Card Skin and two substitution items: Microphone and Orange Headphones. The five featured themes include:\n\n\n\n‚ÄúGO!!!‚Äù by FLOW\n\n\n‚ÄúHaruka Kanata‚Äù by ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION\n\n\n‚ÄúBlue Bird‚Äù by Ikimonogakari\n\n\n‚ÄúSilhouette‚Äù by KANA-BOON\n\n\n‚ÄúKaze‚Äù by Yamazaru\n\n\n\nReliving Naruto history\n\n\nAll of the songs are essentials from the Naruto series, with FLOW's \"GO!!!\" providing the fourth opening theme song for the original. ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION's \"Haruka Kanata\" was the second for Naruto, and Ikimonogakari's \"Blue Bird\" was the third for Naruto Shippuden. KANA-BOON's \"Silhouette\" served as Naruto Shippuden's 16th OP, and Yamazaru's \"Kaze\" directly followed that act. The series has a ton of themes, and this lineup runs the gamut with some heavy hitters.\n\n\nThe appropriately named The Nostalgic Anime Song & Item DLC will be available for all platforms. It's also coming to the limited time Sound Ultimate Bundle, which is a Steam exclusive set that includes the game, season pass, and more.

          "description": "If the debut trailer is anything to go by, chaos is on the menu for Starnaut. Developer Crim announced the spacey adventure for PC, with Early Access to kick off in February 2024. The roguelike action game has you playing as an astronaut on a solo space expedition that lands them in the multiverse. From there you'll be blasting \"endless incoming enemies\" that can be deceptively cute and drop what seems to be an equally endless number of coins.¬†\n\n\nCheck out a sample of the running, blasting, and frequently exploding gameplay in the debut trailer.\n\n\n\n\nBlaster master\n\n\nThe straightforward story sets up a world in which people launched Omega Rockets containing their memories and history before doomsday struck. The rockets ended up landing in the multiverse, though, so it's up to Starnaut to find out if humanity can come back from the brink if all the rockets are returned. More importantly, doing so gives Starnaut an excuse to run around, fire off countless volleys, and collect coins for weapon and suit upgrades.\n\n\nIt all looks like utter madness. There are massive tentacles, floating panda bears, and a bunch of rockets ready to launch. Get all the Omega Rockets flying and launch along with the last one and you'll take home the win, it seems. \"Those enemies are not only hungry for you but YOUR KNUCKLE SANDWICH!!!,\" the description reads. That's a powerful bullet point, right there.¬†\n\n\nIf the name Crim sounds familiar, that's because it's Sawaki Takeyasu's company. The director behind 2011's El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron previously bought that game's rights in 2013, and an HD remaster launched in 2021. Takeyasu is now enthusiastically tweeting about Starnaut, so we'll have to see how it shapes up as we get closer to Early Access.¬†\n\nThe post Starnaut trailer reveals roguelike full of explosions, coins, and endless enemies appeared first on Destructoid.",

Each game invariably controls like garbage. Its vehicle physics is detestable. And the mechanics are very loosely tied together and wobbly. However, as I was doing the legwork to establish the series as kusoge, I realized that, while they are concept-first games, they are fun to play under their own merits.\n\n\nHowever, there are (at least) two exceptions in the series.

Those interested in some spooky goodness don't have to wait long because the new title is out...well...now. Players can download the free Action Adventure title for free on Steam.\n\n\n\n\nVR Only\n\n\nIt appears VR is required to experience Return to Northbury Grove, as the notice on the Steam page indicates a VR headset is required. For now, it looks like OpenXR, Oculus XR, SteamVr, and WMR are the supported platforms.\n\n\nIn Return to Northburgy Grove, players take on the role of Liam Murphy, an aspiring actor determined to land the role of a lifetime at the infamous Rock the Warehouse music festival. When he gets there though, the concert grounds are desolate and Liam gets kidnapped and thrown into the basement of the Spector Forest Slasher's kill-house.\n\n\nIn classic Scythe Dev Team fashion, the visuals and audio are chilling, to say the least. According to the Steam Page, choices matter and can impact your survival in real time. Adaptive AI makes no two playthroughs the same.\n\n\nI'm not quite on the VR train just yet, but this is certainly the kind of game meant for VR. It's like a slasher horror movie except in VR. After playing HHBF I know that Scythe knows how to nail a creepy atmosphere, so I'm sure it's a journey.\n\n\nReturn to Northbury Grove is available now for free on Steam.\n\nThe post Happy‚Äôs Humble Burger Farm devs release free VR title Return to Northbury Grove appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Final Fantasy XIV Patch 6.5 launched with the final tier of its Myths of the Realm Alliance Raid earlier this month, and it's still packing secrets to discover. The new 24-man raid apparently has a little easter egg for players familiar with the MMO's fishing lore, and it involves shooting your shot with one of the realm's 12 gods, Llymlaen.\n\n\nIn the Thaleia Raid, if you catch her at just the right time, using the '/blowkiss' emote on Llymlaen causes her to stop and scold you. \"Oi, cut it out, you!\" she chides, before hitting you with True Damage and taking you down to one HP. \n\n\n\n\nThe Japanese FFXIV fan site Umadori first chronicled player encounters with Llymlaen last week. The attack she uses is Navigator's Dagger, a fish found in La Noscea, where, you guessed it, Llymlaen is the patron god. The in-game description notes these long, blade-like fish are the \"knives thrown by Llymlaen at Her enemies.\" The bigger version of that fish, Navigator's Brand, adds, \"Fishers believe that this wavekin was the blade that Llymlaen threw at Oschon in Her fury at having Her naked form espied.\"\n\n\nAnyway, in the name of science, I tested the FFXIV easter egg myself. I'm happy to report Llymlaen kicked my ass. Sorry for the uh, messy screenshot. I was a little too antsy about getting the watcher of the seas to stab me to death, so quality wasn't top of mind.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nI couldn't tell you the exact moment I caught her, but I did spam the 'blowkiss' emote with the chatlog option turned off ‚Äî didn't want to spam the chat. But at some point, I did get her to turn to me, stun my poor Warrior of Light, and take her down to one HP. I was stunned for so long I died, but worth it.

He explains that he came to this decision after a long and successful career that culminated with the launch of Starfield, and he feels that it is the right time to bow out. \n\n\nIn his announcement post, he thanked fans for all their support over the years. It's not quite clear yet whether he is fully exiting the industry, as he says that he will now spend his time \"exploring interests and passions,\" in addition to stating that \"this is certainly not goodbye by any means.\" \n\n\n\n\nIn response, Bethesda sent Hines a heartwarming Tweet prescribing him plenty of goodies, including lots of gaming, card collecting, and devoting his love and care to foster puppies. It has not yet been revealed who will take his place as Head of Publishing for Bethesda Softworks. \n\n\nBethesda will march forward without Hines, with Todd Howard still serving as the studio's executive producer.

Want to carry corpses around like you're Garret from Thief? Now you can. Want NPCs to break wind? Thy will be done. What about healing your followers mid-battle? That's also a possibility.\n\n\nThanks to veteran modder JaySerpa over on Nexus Mods, there's a way to assist downed companions with a press of a button. Providing you have some potions, you can heal friendly NPCs, rather than waiting for them to recover automatically.\n\n\n\n\nThey even come with some lines of dialog for when you help them, as demonstrated in the video above. JaySerpa says the idea for their \"Press E to Heal Followers\" mod came straight from Starfield, which has a similar feature.\n\n\nIt just won't die\n\n\nSay what you will about Skyrim, it's the gift that keeps on giving. At least as far as custom content is concerned. Given that we're approaching 12 years since the game first released, it's actually quite impressive that it's stood the test of time.\n\n\nOkay, it's definitely aged at this point, but that's where modders like JaySerpa come to the rescue. Over the years, we've seen everything from graphical overhauls to bug fixes to new ways of being immersed incorporated into TES5 by the fan base.\n\n\nWe'll never know whether The Elder Scrolls 6 will be able to enjoy such longevity. We still don't know when it's coming out, but so long as the Skyrim community keeps releasing mods, Bethesda's 2011 epic won't be going anywhere for a while.\n\nThe post Skyrim now allows you to ‚Äúpress E to heal followers,‚Äù thanks to this mod appeared first on Destructoid.",

The 4:3 aspect ratio is a feature of this first-person walking sim horror. One-Eyed Likho is based on the Slavic folklore creature of the same name. The developer describes it as ‚ÄúLikho is an embodiment of evil fate and misfortune in Slavic mythology.‚Äù\n\n\n\n\nNot only is One-Eyed Likho in 4:3, but it‚Äôs also in greyscale. The latter isn‚Äôt entirely uncommon, but the former is pretty rare these days when it comes to 3D titles. But beyond those visual quirks, the game looks rather interesting. There‚Äôs some good horror imagery and good use of the game‚Äôs darkness. There‚Äôs a lot of arson depicted, which is always a plus in my book. Morteshka describes it as ‚Äúburn mechanics,‚Äù which I can get behind. The protagonist also burns their fingers if they hold a lit match for too long, which is something I‚Äôve always wanted to see.\n\n\nI don‚Äôt often intentionally seek out walking simulator games, but I usually enjoy the ones that I play. As a cinematic splinter of the adventure genre, they‚Äôre an effective way of telling a narrative.

          "description": "The fact that Minecraft recently surpassed 300 million sales shows that Mojang's sandbox IP is still a force to be reckoned with. Much of its appeal comes from the ability to create nearly anything you want. In some cases, different worlds from different franchises get the blocky treatment.\n\n\nAs spotted by DSO Gaming, environmental artist and self-professed Bloodborne fan Potomy has released a new project for Minecraft inspired by FromSoftware's gothic game. A few screenshots show the level of detail that's gone into the recreation. However, if you want a better idea of how it looks, the below video gives you a nice taster.\n\n\n\n\nThe only downside to it is, if you want to download the map, you'll need to subscribe to Potomy's Patreon page. It'll set you back $41/¬£36, so you need to be a pretty big fan of both games if you want to justify paying for it.\n\n\nImagine fighting a blocky Cleric Beast\n\n\nReleased in 2015, Bloodborne was exclusively a PS4 title. There hasn't really been any attempt to port the game to other systems, but datamining suggests a PC build is somewhere in the ether. It's a bit of a shame you can't get the game on anything other than the previous-gen PlayStation, especially considering its popularity.\n\n\nAs for Minecraft, it continues to be one of the biggest rag-to-riches stories in video game history. From its small beginnings made by a single person to one of the most successful IPs in gaming, it's still going strong after all these years.\n\n\nIn fact, come 2024, Minecraft will officially be 15 years old (unless you count the alpha release from 2009). In terms of longevity, even the likes of Skyrim can only dream of such a legacy.\n\nThe post Bloodborne recreated in Minecraft is all kinds of blocky awesome appeared first on Destructoid.",

I don't drink coffee, so I don't know how much that is.\n\n\nZipp‚Äôs Caf√© casts you as the eponymous Zipp, proprietor of the Hop Dog. Zipp made an appearance in Chicken Police: Paint it Red as someone who reluctantly helps protagonists Marty and Sonny, even after some previous unpleasantries. The game has you running the Hop Dog and serving a variety of regulars while getting the scoop on Clawville.

The Hop Dog has the best coffee in all of Clawville, but no one knows why.\n\n\n\n\nThere's a lot of unexplored lore in the noir-styled Chicken Police series.

I imagine that Zipp‚Äôs Caf√© is a fun dive for them, as it helps establish more backstory in preparation for Chicken Police: Into the Hive.\n\n\nOh, and to top it off, the press release teases that it will tie into \"other unannounced projects too.\" Pulp novels!? Are the unannounced projects going to be pulp novels!? Considering how much I loved Chicken Police: Paint it Red, I am very eager to dive into more of the universe.\n\n\nZipp‚Äôs Caf√© is coming to PC on November 15, 2023 for the price of \"a small coffee.\"\n\nThe post Zipp‚Äôs Caf√© is a bite-sized prelude to Chicken Police: Into the Hive, coming November 15 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "When it comes to video game sales, there are very few titles that operate on the same stratosphere as Minecraft. The timeless sandbox game has shown its dominance yet again with an announcement from Mojang revealing that it has sold 300 million copies, helping it retain its position as one of the bestselling games of all time. \n\n\n\n\nThe announcement came during the Minecraft Live event held on October 15. Helen Chiang, who is the head of Mojang Studios, stated that the milestone was something \"no one could have dreamed of when we were all placing our first blocks.\" She also showed appreciation for the community, stating that it \"has built Minecraft into what it is today and what it will become in the future.\" \n\n\nMojang shared some interesting stats on Minecraft's official site. Between September 2023 and October 2023 alone, on average per day, there have been 15 million skeletons slayed, 8.8 million pickaxes crafted, and 6.7 million diamonds discovered. \n\n\nImage via Mojang.\n\n\nMinecraft's success story\n\n\nIt's been a long road for Minecraft to reach the heights it has. The game was birthed in 2009 by Notch and it gained a large following of avid fans that allowed the game to grow so popular that it was purchased, along with Mojang, by Microsoft for an amazing $2.5 billion in 2014. \n\n\nSince then, Minecraft has only grown thanks to a steady stream of new content, including the recent Trails and Tales update. There have also been numerous spin-offs released such as Minecraft Legends which launched in April this year. \n\n\nFans have plenty to look forward to. As the Minecraft Live event revealed, the armadillo is the winner of the 2023 Mob Vote. Minecraft is also turning 15 in 2024, and there is plenty in store to celebrate. \n\nThe post Minecraft has sold 300 million copies appeared first on Destructoid.",

The trailer implies that Miles is in over his head fighting the Sandman. Fans of the original game may remember Sandman was teased via a backpack collectible that contained a vial of sand that Peter wasn‚Äôt sure if it actually contained Sandman or just some inert sand.\n\n\nBut the highlight of the trailer is the showcase of Venom and the symbiote-infected Peter, including a Peter in darker clothes and a rude demeanor towards MJ that hearkens back to Spider-Man 3.¬†\n\n\nThe trailer also reveals Norman calling for Oscorp enforcers to ‚Äúget the symbiote off of him!,‚Äù though the camera does not reveal who the him is. While it has been confirmed it won‚Äôt be Eddie Brock, and the first game teased it would be Harry Osborn, the actual identity of the game‚Äôs Venom has been kept a closely guarded secret.¬†\n\n\nThe trailer does showcase more of the black suit, including a knock-down fight between Spider-Man and Lizard. There's also a tense battle between Miles and Mr. Negative, which would mark the first time Miles has been one-on-one with the man responsible for his father‚Äôs death.¬†\n\n\nMarvel‚Äôs Spider-Man 2 releases October 20 for the PlayStation 5.

          "description": "Vincent is coming out of his coffin. Announced at the Final Fantasy VII Rebirth voice cast panel at New York Comic-Con, the voice actor for the gun-toting ex-Turk has been officially confirmed: Matt Mercer. This comes after fans claimed the prolific voice actor was the character when he appeared in the latest State of Play.\n\n\n\n\nDisturbing Vincent Valentine's slumber\n\n\nAs host, Matt Mercer brings up his background work in FFVII Remake after introducing the cast. He then puts the rumors to bed (or coffin, in this case) by saying that he will take on the role of Vincent Valentine in the sequel. Vincent, in Final Fantasy VII, is a former Turk who joins Cloud and his crew on their escapades as revenge on Hojo. He also was the protagonist in Final Fantasy VII: Dirge of Cerberus, voiced by VA legend Steve Blum.\n\n\nBeing in the industry for many years, Matt Mercer is no stranger to big-ticket roles. His parts in Persona 5 (Yusuke), Fire Emblem (Chrom), and Overwatch (Cole Cassidy) were heavily praised. He also hosts the popular Dungeons & Dragons show, Critical Role. Most recently, he played the main villain Ganondorf in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Without a doubt, Matt is the perfect actor to take over Vincent Valentine. I, for one, can't wait to see him in all his glory.\n\n\nWhile fans are likely to be excited by the announcement of Vincent, a fan-favorite character, it is worth noting Square Enix already confirmed he will not be a playable party member during an exclusive interview with Game Informer. \n\n\nFinal Fantasy VII Rebirth releases on February 29, 2024, for PlayStation 5. \n\nThe post Matt Mercer confirmed as Vincent Valentine in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The first Mortal Kombat 1 DLC characters have finally been showcased in a brand-new trailer. \n\n\nWhile series creator Ed Boon had coyly stated they wouldn't be showing an Omni-Man gameplay trailer at New York Comic-Con, that didn't stop them from dropping the trailer online. \n\n\n\n\nThe trailer reveals Omni-Man, voiced by J.K. Simmons, confronting Liu Kang. Liu threatens Omni-Man to kick things off, promising that while Omni-Man has destroyed worlds, he has erased whole timelines. \n\n\nThat doesn't seem to phase Omni-Man, though, who gladly spends the trailer beating the absolute snot out of Liu Kang and Scorpion. \n\n\nOmni-Man's release coincides with the return of Invincible to Amazon Prime Video, as well as the 20th anniversary of the Invincible comic. In the original story, Omni-Man is presented as a Superman pastiche whose son develops superpowers, taking the name Invincible. However, Omni-Man reveals he is actually on Earth to conquer it and hopes to do so with his son at his side. \n\n\nImage via NetherRealm Studios\n\n\nThere are, in fact, multiple nods to the comic included, especially his two fatalities, which reference him holding Invincible up to an oncoming train and Omni-Man's crushing of Red Rush's skull when he murdered Invincible's version of the Justice League. \n\n\nIn addition to Omni-Man, the trailer reveals the first DLC Kameo, Tremor. Originally debuting in the spin-off title Mortal Kombat: Special Forces, Tremor is now best known for his incredible redesign in Mortal Kombat X. \n\n\nOmni-Man is slated for a November 2023 release. Future Mortal Kombat 1 DLC for the game includes The Boys' Homelander, Peacemaker, Quan-Chi, Ermac, and Takeda. Mortal Kombat 1 is available right now. We gave it an 8/10, so it's pretty safe to say you should check it out. \n\nThe post Mortal Kombat 1 reveals Omni-Man, Tremor in eye-popping new trailer appeared first on Destructoid.",

Curiously, even though the game does have its fair share of gameplay-related problems, the problems that have been pushed into the spotlight are far more technical in nature. Namely, Lords of the Fallen runs exceedingly poorly. For some people, that is. Though some have managed to resolve the Unreal Engine 5 title's shoddy performance via driver updates, this is seemingly not a universal solution, meaning that the developer Hexworks has a long road ahead of it. The really curious bit, though, is that Lords of the Fallen seems to run just fine on the Steam Deck, of all things.\n\n\nIndeed, as the aptly named YouTuber Deck Wizard has shown, Valve's low-spec gaming PC seems to be more than capable of running Lord‚Ä¶",

If you want the Pikachu in Grey Felt Hat collaboration card, you'll have to shop online for a qualifying purchase. \n\n\nAs spotted by PokeJungle, the Van Gogh Museum explained it's no longer offering the Pikachu in Grey Felt Hat promo card in person thanks to \"a small group of individuals\" it says \"created an undesirable situation.\" Without the chaos around the card giveaway, the museum believes fans can visit the Pokemon exhibit in a safe, enjoyable experience.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid via Pokemon Center Store\n\n\nHowever, the Pokemon Center will have the Pikachu card available later for online shoppers in the USA, Canada, and the UK, but no date was given. It will also go to various retailers in the Netherlands sometime next year. \n\n\nThe Museum also notes it's still selling merchandise at the exhibit; it's just the Van Gogh Pikachu dropping from its offerings. Those items are up in its online store, too. Restocks happen weekly, so don't panic if the Van Gogh Museum's online store hits you with an \"out of stock\" notice. \n\n\nCan't Catch a Break\n\n\nWhen the Pokemon exhibit was announced late September, many were in love with the concept. I mean, who doesn't want to see a Post-Impressionist painting of Snorlax? As always, there were people who saw it as a means to make a quick buck. So, when the event happened, droves of people flooded the Amsterdam museum to get their hands on merch, causing quite a stir. This led to the Van Gogh Museum pausing sales and an apology from the Pokemon Company.\n\n\nThe exhibit is still around, so if you do want to go as a real fan, tickets are still available.

Rumors swirled about who might take up the Italian plumber's big shoes after longtime voice Charles Martinet announced his departure from the role. Well, it's now confirmed that Mario, as well as Luigi, will be played by voice actor Kevin Afghani in Super Mario Bros. Wonder. It's unknown if he will play the role in future titles.\n\n\n\n\nThis news comes a week before the highly-anticipated release of Super Mario Bros. Wonder, which will now mark Kevin's first appearance as the beloved icon. Nintendo themselves, as reported by The Verge, confirmed his role in an email sent out to them. The reveal of Mario and Luigi's new voice lines up with Doug Bowser (not that Bowser) saying the actor would be revealed towards release. It also comes a day after data-miners, according to Kotaku, managed to find the cast list through demos available at various Target locations.\n\n\nIn terms of Kevin Afghani's work, he hasn't done too much. His biggest role on IMDb lists Arnold in Genshin Impact. He's also done some YouTube skits for the video-game-based animation channel MASHED. It's a very impressive feat for someone to become the next face of Mario early in their career. I can speak for a lot of people when I say that we can't wait to see what Kevin can do and wish him the best. \n\n\nSuper Mario Bros.

Now, Analogue is targeting the Nintendo 64 catalog with its next device, the Analogue 3D.¬†\nAnalogue has shared an image of what appears to be the device, although the full look at it is obscured.

You can check it out below:¬†\nAnalogue says the 3D device will feature 4K HDMI output, its proprietary Analogue OS, wireless Bluetooth, and 2.4G Wi-Fi. It will also have \"4 original-style controller ports,\" presumably so that players can use their original Nintendo 64 controllers with the 3D. The company says the 3D's 4K output allowed \"us to created incomprehensibly profound Original Display Modes,\" and that in collaboration with 8BitDo, it will release a wireless controller for the device.¬†\nAnalogue didn't share more, but the 3D is set to release some time in 2024.

Join us as we take a bloody journey through the game's genre-defining story campaign. ¬†\nAfter 2006's Mortal Kombat: Armageddon seemingly concluded the franchise's main narrative, 2011's entry picked up the bloody pieces. It moved the saga forward by resetting the timeline, serving as a soft reboot that brought Mortal Kombat back to its 2D fighting roots and ushering in the return of the classic roster. MK 9's cinematic story mode served as an epiphany for the series and fighting games as a whole, establishing the blueprint for narrative fighting campaigns still utilized today. MK9's story also serves as the first chapter of the modern trilogy of games that Mortal Kombat 1 builds upon. For a whole lot more on MK9 and its development, you can read this feature on how the reboot saved the franchise.\nJoin editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they battle their way through MK 9 to see how its reimagined tournament holds up.¬†\nPart 1 - Surpr-iced!¬†\nPart 2 - Bringing The Smoke\nPart 3 - Staff Meeting\nPart 4 - My Life As A Lin Kuei Robot\nFinale - Waking the Dragons\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven‚Äôt subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

The PS5 digital edition retails at $449.99, a $50 increase from the original digital edition.¬†\nIf you do buy a newer digital version and decide to upgrade it to a disc version, the drive will cost you $79.99 in the US, ‚Ç¨119.99 in Europe,¬†¬£99.99 in the UK, and ¬•11,980 in Japan. The total cost of a digital console and a disc drive is a little more expensive than buying a disc drive version outright. The console will include a new horizontal stand to set the console on its side, and a vertical stand will be on sale for $29.99 USD | 29.99 EURO | 24.99 GBP | 3,980 JPY.

Elephant Mario, who appears larger than life on our current cover art, quickly became one of the most recognizable elements of Super Mario Bros.

According to The Verge, a source familiar with Microsoft's plans indicated that it was aiming for Friday, October 13, as a date to close the deal. Ignoring the infamy of the date (it seems Microsoft and Activision Blizzard executives aren't very superstitious), it's not a surprising day to choose.¬†Back in July, the two parties in the deal jointly agreed to extend the deadline of their agreement to October 18 in order to sort out any further regulatory concerns. At the time of publishing, that date is only twelve days away, so the deal would have to be closed soon.\nStill, the Microsoft legal department will have to deal with a few more legal challenges before they're completely out of the woods. After restructuring the terms of the merger to grant Ubisoft the rights to stream Activision Blizzard games in the UK,¬†the¬†Competition and Markets Authority¬†granted the deal a preliminary approval, but the regulator still has to make a final assessment sometime before October 18. Still, Microsoft and Activision Blizzard each took this as a major win.\nWe are encouraged by this positive development in the CMA‚Äôs review process. We presented solutions that we believe fully address the CMA‚Äôs remaining concerns related to cloud game streaming, and we will continue to work toward earning approval to close prior to the October 18‚Ä¶\nSeptember 22, 2023\nThis news followed the companies' victory over the Federal Trade Commission¬†back in July. At this point, it seems fairly likely that the deal will go through, ending a saga that began almost two years ago. After documents from the hearings leaked and revealed Microsoft's hybrid console, a new Xbox model, and plans to acquire other companies like Sega and Bungie, Microsoft is probably ready to leave the entire matter behind it.\n[Source: The Verge]\nHow do you feel about the acquisition coming to a close?

Today, CD Projekt Red announced that they're taking the next step with the franchise ‚Äì creating a live-action production.\nThe game studio is partnering with Anonymous Content, a media company known for its work on shows like Mr. Robot and films like The Revenant. The project will be produced by¬†Garrett Kemble, David Levine, Ryan Schwartz,¬†Bard Dorros, and Charlie Scully, who will develop the project \"in close collaboration with the¬†Cyberpunk 2077¬†creative team.\" That said, this is still in the earliest stages; there's still no screenwriter attached to the project.\nThere are still many questions in the air about the project. They've yet to announce (and perhaps, decide) whether it will be a film or a series. And while the project is \"set in the world\" of Cyberpunk 2077, there are a lot of approaches they could take. No actors have been attached to the project either, so whether Keanu Reeves or Idris Elba will show up is still up in the air. You can read the full press release here.\nFor more Cyberpunk, here's what we thought of the latest expansion, Phantom Liberty, and here's a list of tips and tricks to help you get started.

Now, as part of Atari's Recharged lineup, it has revealed Berzerk: Recharged, and its coming to consoles and PC later this year.¬†\nThe original Berzerk is an arcade game released in 1980. In it, players controlled a top-down avatar while shooting through hordes of armed robots in an electrified maze. The big bad was Evil Otto, who bounced around the maze as a giant smiley face, hunting players down. Atari says Otto is back in Berzerk: Recharged, \"bringing with him updated graphics, deft twin-stick controls, and a new soundtrack by the acclaimed Megan McDuffee.\"¬†\nCheck out Berzerk: Recharged for yourself in the announcement trailer below:¬†\n\n\n\"Though he sports an ominous grin‚Ä¶",

All of them are watching a gift rise into the sky by way of a balloon, in classic Animal Crossing fashion; somebody get them a slingshot or two.¬†\nCheck out the Animal Crossing Lego teaser trailer for yourself below:¬†\nWelcome to‚Ä¶LEGO Animal Crossing!#AnimalCrossing #LEGO #Nintendo pic.twitter.com/un3R7QwlRC\nOctober 5, 2023\nThis Animal Crossing collaboration with Lego isn't the first time Nintendo and Lego have worked together on Lego sets.

It did so, and while the game looked great on both consoles, it was only playable at 30 FPS. PlayStation 5 owners were left wondering if Rockstar wasn't tapping into the power of the current-gen console to bring 60 FPS to the 13-year-old game.¬†\nNow, weeks later, Rockstar has updated the PS4 port of Red Dead Redemption and the included Undead Nightmare DLC to include 60 FPS support on PS5 via backward compatibility. It did so randomly, with a quick tweet announcing the news.¬†\nRed Dead Redemption, including Undead Nightmare, now supports up to 60 FPS on PlayStation 5 via backward compatibility. pic.twitter.com/XMLIe6gYo4\nOctober 4, 2023\nElsewhere in the same update, Rockstar added an option to enable subtitles upon first booting the game. The update also includes general bug fixes and improvements, although Rockstar didn't list which.¬†\nIf you bought Red Dead Redemption on PS4 recently to play on PS5, or were looking for a reason to do so, this new update that adds a 60 FPS option might be the reason you were looking for. Now, Rockstar please bring 60 FPS to Red Dead Redemption II on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.

After completing the game, it's safe to say that's definitely the case, with Mirage falling somewhere between where this franchise began and the modern RPGs of late.

The updated gameplay features a jetpack that allows you to leave the ground, providing a new and fresh perspective that emphasizes the excitement and challenges of exploring Tricuspid, the second alien moon of planet Evath.\nThis time, the vicious Ketars have scattered and hidden Energy Collection Devices (ECD) around their base to destroy your home planet. It‚Äôs up to you to destroy them first! The tricky part is many ECDs are connected to each other and can regenerate instantly, so you must figure out the right order to successfully complete your mission. \nOur reimplementation of the Freescape engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Dark Side support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC. Additionally, there are two playable demos if you want to test the game. Support for Amiga and AtariST will be available later! Please contact us if you have some other release.\nTo play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.\n>",
