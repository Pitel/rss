You thought of the PlayStation classic Bushido Blade, didn't you? And it's about time we finally got a spiritual successor. And that's exactly what Grindstone and Triple Hill Interactive's brand new game, Die by the Blade, is trying to do.\nFunded via Kickstarter back in 2020, and inspired by the aforementioned unique beat 'em up alongside Dark Souls and Way of the Samurai, players will be able to face off against their opponents in a samurai-punk world in nail-biting combat. Who will get the first hit, and will they be able to kill them in one go?

          "description": "\"Now dig on this\".\nSince the last 8-bit-style game came out, Shovel Knight has been branching out more into other genres as developer and publisher Yacht Club charts a course for where its eponymous nobleman will go next. In December, we got the wonderful Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon, which smartly blended falling block puzzle mechanics with roguelite game design. Now, we’re getting another roguelite in Shovel Knight Dig, only this time the gameplay is much more in line with the action-platforming of the original game. As you’d probably expect of this franchise by now, it’s an absolute blast to play; developer Nitrome (Bomb Chicken) delivers a tough, rewarding, and enjoyable new experience that series aficionados will want to dig into immediately.\nShovel Knight Dig takes place sometime before the original Shovel Knight, so Shield Knight hasn’t disappeared yet and the Enchantress has yet to rise to power and form the Order of No Quarter. Here, the main villain is a new character named Drill Knight, who has formed a group of knights called the Hexcavators to help him in raiding a treasure room buried somewhere deep within the earth. Their efforts to do so—and the enormous hole they’ve created—are creating problems for the people on the surface, so Shovel Knight and Shield Knight dive in to try to get to the bottom of what’s going on.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "You've only got OneShot.\nA cat-like child named Niko wakes up in a decrepit house, locked in a room with a bookshelf, a password-locked computer, and a TV remote control on the floor. It’s too dark to read the books and there’s no sign of a password anywhere – it's up to you to find a way out. Not long after, Niko stumbles upon a massive lightbulb in the basement. Carrying this prize into the lightless wastes, a prophetic robot claims Niko is the saviour – a messiah meant to carry the sun to the tower at the centre of the world to restore daylight. This is the set-up of OneShot: World Machine Edition, a short point-and-click adventure game originally developed in 2014 with an endearing, sombre story.\nGames like OneShot are difficult to review because to delve too deeply into the narrative would ruin the experience. Just know this: developer Future Cat makes you – the player – a character in the story. Niko’s quest is framed as a game installed on a PC that functions as both a menu and narrative device. Options to choose wallpapers, change the colour scheme, view achievements, and the like take the form of desktop icons. Niko will frequently break the fourth wall to address you by your Nintendo Switch profile name as you guide her through a dying world. Future Cat makes clever use of this dichotomy between the desktop PC and the game within to add creative layers to an already compelling adventure.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Before beginning your descent into deicide, you must claim your unholy knife and oh, there it is, surrounded by hopping little crystalline birds! What pretty birds they are! Oh, and they're cheeping little tinging cheeps! And they hop back if I step towards them! And they flutter into the skies if I charge! And form a big flock if I chase long enough! Ah. Yeah, I think I see how our character earned a place in superhell.\nRead more",

          "description": "Have you ever played a game and thought, \"Are we actually the bad guys here?\" Usually, the whole \"we're fighting on the wrong side of history\" line is a deliberate plot device in RPGs, offering moments of clarity to not only peel back the curtain and provide fresh impetus for the events yet to come, but also to cleverly reframe everything you've achieved so far. I don't say this to spoil the events of The DioField Chronicle, the new real-time strategy game from Lancarse and Square Enix, but it is a question I found myself asking a lot during its middle act - and it never quite delivers the punchline you're looking for. \nAround 8-10 hours into the game, there's an extended portion of the campaign that sees your band of Blue Fox mercenaries bringing an entire region of DioField Island to heel because they're, err, pro democracy. Of the cast's central quartet, only one stands up as a voice of reason when motions are made to quell these despicable riots, but he's repeatedly shot down every time he tries to offer an alternate view. Eventually, one character says to him, and I quote, \"Isca, what has got into you? You ought to know the danger posed by the ideology of democracy.\" It's an odd stance for someone clearly not a villain to take in 2022, although really, I should have probably seen it coming. Our mercs work for a duke after all, and most are aristocratic nobles who are handy with a sword. Oh no. I think this might actually be played: Tories - The Game. Yuck. \nRead more",

More importantly, you can flip back and forth between these pivotal moments at any time, allowing you to deploy new words in earlier chapters to see what happens.\r\n\nExcept, Beacon Pines is far less choice-driven than I expected.

In Hyper Demon, a long and cautious run will likely score lower than a short burst of ultraviolence. What glorious ultraviolence it is!\nWhen I first saw Hyper Demon's trailer, I felt excitement, wonder, and fear. Here's the important thing to realise: the unearthly and incomprehensible violence you see in that trailer is genuinely what the game looks like to play.

          "description": "As expected, Nvidia have announced the GeForce RTX 4090 during their GeForce Beyond livestream – and confirmed the RTX 4080 for good measure. Both GPUs are based on Nvidia’s new Ada Lovelace architecture, and will launch this year: the RTX 4090 on October 12th, and the RTX 4080 sometime in November. \r\n\n\r\nKey features of Ada Lovelace, and thus these new cards, include 3rd Gen RT cores, 4th Gen Tensor cores, and a new streaming multiprocessor. These supposedly add up to twice the performance of Ampere (that’s the RTX 30 series architecture currently dominating our best graphics card guide) in standard rasterised games, and up to four times the performance in ray traced games. And since Nvidia were clearly in a ray-tracey mood, they also took the opportunity to reveal Portal RTX: a semi-official mod for the original Portal that upgrades it with RT lighting and reflection effects. Corrrr.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Castle Dimitrescu was one of the many highlights of Resident Evil Village, so it makes sense that Capcom are returning to it in the game's upcoming DLC adventure, Shadows Of Rose. Set 16 years after the events of Village, this story expansion centres on Rose, the daughter of Village protagonist Ethan Winters, as she comes to terms with her emerging mold powers. She was just a teeny, tiny baby when her dad was fighting off the very tall vampire lady in the base game, but now she's all grown up and wants to be rid of the supernatural spore abilities that have been plaguing her family ever since the events of Resident Evil 7. \nIt's not yet clear what role Lady D's castle has to play in Rose's journey, but man, it sure is nice to be back roaming its ornate hallways again. Or rather it would be, if it weren't for all the ashen mold men stalking its corridors, and its rather gross (but strangely hypnotic) rivers of undulating strawberry jam gore that have been plastered all over the walls, floor and ceiling. Ach, now it's on my shoes. Great. And the gate's locked behind me. Fantastic. I knew coming back here would be a bad idea…\nRead more",

Technically, none of this should come as a surprise. Not only are they all Street Fighter faithfuls, but pretty much the entire cast list got leaked back in June thanks to some rogue character art. One thing that has been pleasantly surprising, however, is learning that Ken, pictured in that leaked document as looking rather dishevelled and rocking a bit of a 'sad, middle-aged dad' look, is anything but.\nIndeed, when I went to play the latest build of Street Fighter 6 at Capcom's UK offices earlier in the week, Ken was absolutely killing it. Rather than suffering from a mid-life crisis, Ken was hauling it across the screen like an absolute battering ram, clearly full of the same mad protein shakes his mate Ryu's been hawking down since their last SF outing, as both of them have gone full-on Redfield Beefcake this time. \nRead more",

There’s just something about the animal-like antics of those immense, lumbering creatures that make them naturally adorable, even though they wouldn’t hesitate in breaking every single bone in my small, weak body.\nZürich-based developers Stray Fawn Studio totally get what I’m on about, and have created their own lovable rocky giant in their city-building sim The Wandering Village. Their creature, Onbu, is a colossal six-legged beast, and the walking platform on which your village sits, a plateau of flat land mass on its back making for an excellent settlement ground. Onbu is best described as a gentle giant. They move slowly but carefully, love to munch on fields of wild mushrooms, nap in meadows of soft pink flowers, and tuck in their paws and tail when sleeping.\nRead more",

          "description": "Hand Of Fate was such a singular thing. On the one hand, it was a tabletop deckbuilding game that saw you picking through roguelike-style dungeons by choosing different cards dealt out by its mysterious Dealer. On the other, it was also an action-packed hack and slasher, bringing its fantastical fight sections to life in fully 3D combat arenas - and there hasn't been anything quite like it since. Voice Of Cards certainly had a go, but its tedious battle system landed it straight on its own discard pile. Thankfully, we've now got the infinitely more engaging Foretales, a new narrative card game from French developers Alkemi, and it comes pretty damn close to capturing that Hand Of Fate goodness. \nIt doesn't ever venture into the realms of 3D admittedly, erring more toward the Inscryption school of tabletop combat encounters, but it does nail the delivery of telling an artful, swashbuckling adventure through cards and cards alone. And much like Hand Of Fate, this isn't a one and done affair, either, as there are multiple paths to take through this entertaining fantasy yarn, and several game-changing decisions you'll have to make as you try and avert a string of terrible visions threatening to destroy its anthropomorphic animal world. You won't succeed at preventing them all during a single playthrough, but its hard choices only make its overarching story that much more gripping. \nRead more",

Talking to devs especially is a wonderful thing, especially when you're playing their game and it resonates with you. But getting hands-on with an early portion of American Arcadia rendered me virtually silent, to the point where I had to apologise to the devs for being so quiet.\nAnd I wasn't being rude; far from it! I was just so engrossed in the game's mixture of side-scrolling platforming and first-person puzzling.

          "description": "Gloomwood is, so far, a very good game, but it is also not much of a game - in the literal sense that it has launched into early access incomplete. There's currently just enough of it to play that it makes you feel both bereft and quite annoyed when it suddenly clangs its great iron doors shut in front of you. \"Let me in!!\" you scream, as you hammer on the silent portal. \"I really like Thief! I get you! I want to throw more decapitated heads as lures!\"\nIf you are one of those people who bases their gaming personality on liking the original Thief series, Gloomwood will have been on your radar for a while. It's a grimy, steampunk-ish stealth immersive sim with a deliberate low-poly vibe, and it picks up the abandoned Thief football to absolutely run with it. But, though the current EA build is but short, it feels like Gloomwood is aiming to punt that ball into outer space. There's so much more room to be playful and experiment than I expected, and it's so much fun that if you'd never played a stealth sim in your life I'd recommend Gloomwood. Except I wouldn't, because it feels like I'd be doing you a disservice to recommend it now, when the fun will be so quickly snatched away.\nRead more",

I suspect it's probably a similar experience to watching the carnage of Chivalry II play out from the safety of a nearby bench. The newly announced Warlander from Nier Replicant devs Toylogic certainly has the medieval setting in common with Torn Banner Studio's first-person hack and slash, but this free-to-play multiplayer warfare game is an altogether different beast. You control your warriors in third-person, for starters, and its more cartoonish visuals allow for, well, daft cataclysmic events like a flaming meteor shower to hone in on a player's position without appearing completely over the top. As it prepares to enter its first open beta later today, September 12th, I went hands on with a brief demo build to see what it was all about. \nRead more",

While we wait for Mina the Hollower to arrive, there's more Shovel Knight coming your way this month.\nShovel Knight Dig, a roguelite platformer, is the latest attempt to mix things up.

Players are reporting in, unable to access the game, and the social account has acknowledged a confirmed issue.\nAs noted by PC Gamer, speculation had started picking up yesterday on the Steam forums, where users were starting to have issues with the servers.\nA new tweet from the Dark Souls brand account on Twitter notes that there is a confirmed issue with Dark Souls III online play, via the Steam platform.\n\"We are investigating the source of the problem and will inform you as soon as more details become available,\" the update says. \"Thank you for your patience.\"\nhttps://twitter.com/DarkSoulsGame/status/1572548464164347905\nRise again, Ashen One\nThe PC servers for Dark Souls III were off for quite a while. Users discovered an exploit in the Souls series that has kept its PC versions offline for most of the year. Online PC services only just recently came back online for Dark Souls III. The team behind the updates had previously said they were working on bringing services back for the other back-entries in the Souls series, but now it looks like Dark Souls III may need more attention.\nMeanwhile, Elden Ring had the specific vulnerability addressed pre-launch and has been cooking along just fine. So for PC players, the only FromSoft multiplayer game in town is Elden Ring once again.\nIt's a bummer, as each game has had its own meta-game and PvP communities. Numbers even seemed to jump up a bit for Dark Souls III after the fix was implemented.\nThough no specifics have been given, hopefully this fix doesn't take months like the others have. We'll learn more as the Souls team works on getting the Dark Souls III PC servers back up.\nThe post Dark Souls III PC servers are having issues again appeared first on Destructoid.",

The game was officially announced in 2012 with the launch of a Kickstarter campaign to raise funds for development, and while it was anticipated to release in 2014, the game was delayed multiple times... and still is yet to receive any sort of official release window.\nTen years after the launch of the Star Citizen crowdfunding campaign, the game has reached an incredible milestone by raising over $500 million — the official count as of today is $500,075,150 from 4,096,384 backers.

          "description": "Nintendo confirms what most assumed\nHow is Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom pronounced? Well that's easy, because we have an official answer from Nintendo! As reported by Eurogamer, Nintendo has clarified that it's \"tears,\" as in the \"crying\" variety, not tears, like tearing a piece of paper. I can see the eyerolling now, but this was debated by some for a hot minute!\nGiven the dark tone and how things seem to be in disarray in this new entry, \"tears\" (again, crying) of sorrow is what immediately went to my head. However, as many have pointed out, much of the kingdom seems to be literally torn apart in the game's various trailers, with plenty of floating structures that would feel right at home in a Miyazaki movie. It's entirely possible that \"tears\" (crying) could be literal items that you pick up in the game, or directly incorporated into the story in some way. Nintendo has plenty of time to showcase story details in various streams and reveals.\nHere's all we have to go off of for now: \"In addition to the vast lands of Hyrule, the latest entry in the storied Legend of Zelda series will take you up into the skies!\"\nIn any case, it's going to take me ages to not refer to this as Zelda: Breath of the Wild: Tears of the Kingdom. I mean I almost typed that out multiple times when talking about the game, even in this very article! Despite being billed as a full sequel to Breath of the Wild, there's no \"2\" in the moniker, and it's going its own way. It makes perfect sense, as word will travel that it's a direct follow-up anyway.\nWe'll see how much Breath of the Wild DNA is truly baked in when it arrives on May 12, 2023.\nThe post In case you were wondering, Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is pronounced like “tears of joy” appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "'Tis the season for more Picross\nJupiter is back to bring some more Picross action to the Switch. Picross S8 has been announced for the Nintendo Switch, arriving on September 29 with a cool feature: four-player co-op.\nIn Picross S8, up to four players will be able to co-op solve Picross puzzles on a single Switch. Each player will need their own controller, but you can use single Joy-Cons for each person if you'd like.\nSeeing it in action can feel almost bizarre. Different colored bars and crosshairs jaunt around the board, and it looks like players rack up points for their correct guesses.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIBaaQajwyI\nFor me, Picross is often a solo exercise of light brain puzzling and the good feeling of getting a guess right. It fills the same space as logic puzzles or sudoku. But I can see how, especially with the big boards, it would be fun to get a bunch of people in. Plus, it would probably make teaching a family member or loved one how to play Picross pretty easy.\nEven more puzzling\nOf course, on top of the new feature in co-op, there is plenty of Picross to tackle. 300 Picross and Mega Picross puzzles are included in Picross S8. There are also 150 Clip Picross puzzles, 30 Color puzzles, and five extra puzzles. That total count is 485 puzzles, if you lost track.\nLinking play data from Picross S4, S5, and S6 also unlocks three Extra puzzles. It is a chance for even more Picross to uncover, either with friends or all by yourself.\nThis marks the eighth Picross S entry on the Switch for Jupiter, and the studio has become pretty good at rolling these out at a regular pace. Just like the seasons change and leaves fall, a new Picross is probably around the corner. I'm still waiting for the day we get another Picross 3D, but I'm always happy to have some new puzzles on my Switch for my next long stretch of travel.\nThe post Picross S8 arrives this month with four-player co-op appeared first on Destructoid.",

The DLC includes outfits based on the recent remake NieR: Replicant, as well as some traditional Japanese garb, including samurai and kunoichi gear, complete with fox masks.\nNieR: Automata first launched on PS4 back in 2017 and has slowly gathered a larger and larger audience in the ensuing years. The dizzying hack 'n' slash title tells the story of a war between mankind and the machines, and the fates of the sentient androids that are placed right in the center of the interplanetary conflict. NieR: Automata has won praise for its bleak, dystopian world, dramatic storytelling, smart enemy design, and its unforgettable protagonist, 2B, who has fast become a gaming icon.

This applies across the board to all Nintendo Accounts, even on Nintendo Switch, so it's not a legacy/Wii U/3DS thing.\nWhat does this even mean, exactly?\n\nNote that a lot of folks can safely ignore this option, though some of you might be impacted. As you can see in the example sign-in screen above, there's an option to use Facebook or Twitter directly, in addition to Google, Apple, and a direct Nintendo Account login.\nSo roughly seven years ago, Nintendo touted the ability to sign into a Nintendo Network account with Facebook and Twitter as a way to acquire customers more easily. But a lot has changed since then, particularly when it comes to information security. While Nintendo hasn't given a concrete reason for why they're making this change, it's coming regardless, so you might need to prepare yourself for the October 25 end date. For the time being, it has been clarified that Google/Apple sign-ins will stay.\nTo be extra clear, the ability to share screens and the like on Twitter and Facebook will remain, this change is solely for Nintendo Account sign-ins.\nThe post Nintendo is removing the ability to sign in with Facebook or Twitter appeared first on Destructoid.",

Previously, the console would always do a brief online handshake to ensure that the Xbox One game in question was an authentic, licensed title and not a copied disc — The Xbox Series S, being discless, obviously had no need to perform this additional step.\nSpeaking on Twitter, Xbox engineer and great-named person Eden Marie confirmed the update.\n\"Yes, this is true since the 2206 update,\" wrote Marie. \"We examined data since Series X/S launch & determined the online compatibility check isn't needed in the vast majority of cases for Xbox One discs. Some games may still need to be updated online after install to ensure the best experience.\"\nWhile this is a different situation entirely, one cannot help but recall the PR disaster that occurred prior to the Xbox One console's release, where Microsoft stated that an online connection was a mandatory demand for the playing of Xbox One games, to ensure that the player had indeed purchased a license for each and every title. While this would eventually prove not to be the case, there's no denying whatsoever that the initial statement was a Sword of Damocles over the brand, and certainly contributed to sales of Xbox hardware declining at the start of the eighth generation.\nThe 2206 Update is now live on Xbox Series X/S platforms.\nThe post Xbox Series X removes DRM checks for Xbox One games appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, anyone expecting any sort of reveal may want to keep their expectations in check...\nAccording to a statement by publisher Atlus, the concert will not be used as an opportunity to reveal any new games set within the reality-bending universe.

With ringing ears, tapping toes, and having had a great night, mind, but disappointed.\nIt's understandable that some fans might be getting a tad antsy, given that the smash-seller Persona 5 debuted way back in 2016, following a development cycle that lasted practically an entire generation. Since then, Atlus has released several new spin-offs, including musou-like Persona 5 Strikers, two new Persona Dancing titles, and Persona Q2: New Cinema Labyrinth for Nintendo 3DS.

          "description": "Manage the comedy series' team your way\nThis is a bit different from the usual news of a club signing on for FIFA. Electronic Arts confirms that Ted Lasso, of the series Ted Lasso, and the AFC Richmond squad are joining the roster of FIFA 23.\nJason Sudeikis' portrayal of lovable coach Ted Lasso will appear in-game, as well as a host of others from the AFC Richmond crew. Coach Beard, Jamie Tartt, Dani Rojas, Sam Obisanya, Roy Kent, and Isaac McAdoo are all lined up. Their home field of Nelson Road is also being integrated into FIFA 23.\nAnd honestly, they all look solid in motion. Check it out in the trailer below.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUamiLX6gp4\nAccording to the EA blog about the news, Ted will be selectable as a playable manager in Career Mode. You can also opt to manage AFC Richmond, swapping them into the Premier League or other playable Career Mode leagues.\nAFC Richmond will also be playable in other modes, like Kick-Off, Online Friendlies, and Online Seasons, with the Nelson Road stadium available.\nKits and TIFOs for AFC Richmond are also being incorporated into Ultimate Team, as well as the option to have Ted or Coach Beard as your club manager. All AFC Richmond content in the FUT mode will be available through objectives and challenges.\nBarbeque sauce\nIf you're not familiar, Ted Lasso is a series on Apple+ based on an NBC shorts series. Ted is an American football coach who moves to England to take up the head coaching job for a Premier League team, and while it's definitely a comedy, it's also pretty heartfelt and enjoyable.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7EIiohs6U\nSo it's definitely rad to see the whole AFC crew in here, and yeah, I'm actually kind of into the idea of playing a season as Ted and AFC. That chance isn't far off either. FIFA 23 goes live on September 30 for PlayStation, Xbox, PC, and Stadia.\nThe post Ted Lasso and AFC Richmond are headed to FIFA 23 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Many veteran players were frustrated by an — understandably odd — new tweak that has been made to the in-game mini-map.\nIt's all a question of noise location. In Modern Warfare 2 multiplayer, the sound of players firing their weapons does not register as a red dot on the mini-map, giving away their position. This baffling choice has been implemented in order to force players to source out enemy positions via sound only.

The Netflix series follows Sonic and pals in some new adventures, though it looks like they'll be dealing with some old villains in the process.\nWe've seen a few quick teasers of the upcoming series, but today's teaser trailer shows a pretty hefty amount of Sonic Prime.\nNotably, you can spot a few familiar faces in the teaser. Shadow the Hedgehog, Big the Cat, and of course, Eggman.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUb16YyU-04\nIt seems like there's some kind of multi-verse, shattering of reality situation going on here. Whatever plans Eggman and other characters like Shadow are up to, Sonic will have to handle them.\nThe series is set to premiere this holiday season, and a landing page is live over on Netflix right now if you want to set up a reminder.\nYear of the blue blur\nIt's been quite the year for Sonic, all things considered. The movie franchise side of Sonic the Hedgehog has done quite well, and looks to be expanding further. Another movie is planned, which isn't too surprising given the second film's stinger, and a Knuckles series is on the way too.\nOn the video game side, Sonic fans already got a classic collection in Sonic Origins. And there's Sonic Frontiers on the way as well, taking the high-speed action into the big open world.\nIt's been a big year for fans of the blue hedgehog. And for Netflix, Sonic Prime could set a good tone for video game adaptations moving forward. The company's had some great success with Castlevania, Arcane, and now Cyberpunk: Edgerunners. At least in terms of animation, the adaptations have been largely solid. While Sonic Prime is a bit more kid-friendly than those series, it'd be nice to see Sonic getting a solid series among all the adaptations coming out of Netflix.\nSonic Prime speeds onto Netflix later this year.\nThe post Netflix Sonic Prime series gets a new teaser trailer appeared first on Destructoid.",

A localization is currently in the works.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgKpNzoqwG8\nAs previously reported, the Cosmic Fantasy Collection will consist of two titles: 1990's Cosmic Fantasy: Adventure Boy Yuu, and 1991's TurboGrafx CD sequel Cosmic Fantasy 2: Adventure Boy Van. The latter title was the only game in the series to find its way to western shores, and remains something of an obscurity regardless, so retro gaming fans will definitely want to consider giving this new remaster a space on the radar.\nThe Cosmic Fantasy franchise would see relative success upon its debut in Japan, thanks to its quirky comedic style and obligatory love of naughty cheesecake fanservice. The series would spin off into several other adventures, and would also receive manga and anime adaptations, as well as a range of toys and merchandise. An intriguing little lost oddity in the annals of '90s gaming.

Layden announced his new gig on industry site LinkedIn.\nAccording to Layden, his new role will see him \"advise, assist, and support the team at Tencent as they deepen their activities and commitments within the industry to which I’ve devoted the majority of my career.\"\n\"We are at an epoch-defining moment in gaming and interactive entertainment,\" continued Layden. There are many possible roads ahead but only a few are profound, broadening, inclusive, edifying, inspiring, and/or sustainable. I am thrilled to continue this journey of discovery and thank Tencent for the opportunity.\"\nLayden has held several high-ranking roles in PlayStation, including President and CEO of the industry giant's U.S. operations. His final role with the company was as the chairman of PlayStation Worldwide Studios, a position Layden left in 2019, citing concerns about burnout in an interview with Bloomberg.\nTencent has been in gaming's headlines with incredible frequency, having made an aggressive push to expand both its portfolio of developers and publishers, while also pushing its operations further into western territories, no doubt Layden's global experience will help Tencent in its endeavors.\nRecent years have seen the holding company pick up outlets such as Activision, Supercell, Epic Games, Remedy, Riot Games, PlatinumGames, Bohemia Interactive, Dontnod Entertainment, Klei Entertainment, Inflexion, Sumo Digital, and Funcom. Most recently, Tencent teamed with Sony to purchase a 30% stake in FromSoftware owners Kadokawa Group, and has also entered into a partnership with Ubisoft founders Guillemot Family.\nThe post Former PlayStation exec Shawn Layden takes up advisory role in Tencent appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Here's what happened\nSo roughly a week ago, Radiant Silvergun arrived on the Switch following a Nintendo Direct announcement. That's good! But then it was quickly removed from sale. That's bad! As of today though, that crisis has been averted, and Radiant Silvergun is now live on Switch.\nSo what went down with Radiant Silvergun on Switch? Thankfully, we have a full report from the publisher, Live Wire\nThe same day Radiant Silvergun went live on Switch, it was taken down. A lot of folks speculated that it was ratings-related, which was confirmed by the publisher several days later on Twitter: \"The reason it was removed from the store is because the product's rating has changed. We have created new data and have already submitted it to them.\" The team also took the opportunity to begin to address some of the bugs that were present in the briefly-released port.\nSo after all that, the game is back up. The browser listing may not be live depending on your region, but the game is currently live on the actual Switch eShop.\nIt's a good thing this was resolved, because Radiant Silvergun is an all-time classic shmup (shoot 'em up), and it deserves to be on as many platforms as possible. Thankfully the eShop issue was minor, and the team has acknowledged this version's bugs and is working on a fix.\nThe post After some trouble, Radiant Silvergun is now live on Switch again appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The Apple TV show Ted Lasso has proven to be one of the most popular and well-liked series of the last few years, introducing viewers to a lovable cast of characters whose lives and storylines largely revolve around the fictional English Premier League football club, AFC Richmond. Through its first two seasons, the series has taken home numerous awards, including the Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series in 2021 and 2022, with several of its actors – including Jason Sudeikis, Brett Goldstein, and Hannah Waddingham – taking home awards for original performances. Now, Ted Lasso reaches into a new realm: video games. \nEA Sports today announced that Ted Lasso and AFC Richmond are joining the FIFA 23 roster of teams. Lasso is joined on the sidelines by Coach Beard, with the pitch being populated by some of the team's biggest stars like Jamie Tartt, Roy Kent, Dani Rojas, Sam Obisanya, and Isaac McAdoo. While the actors' likenesses are included in the product, EA Sports hasn't indicated if we'll be hearing Jamie Tartt and Roy Kent's signature crowd chants (though it seems doubtful, seeing as how Roy Kent's chant would probably bump the ESRB rating up to M for Mature).\nRegardless of that fact, you can play matches at AFC Richmond's home ground, Nelson Road, and even take control of Coach Lasso or AFC Richmond through Career Mode. AFC Richmond is also playable in Kick-Off, Online Friendlies, and Online Seasons. FIFA 23 Ultimate Team is also adding several AFC Richmond customization items, including kits, TIFOs, and the option to select Ted Lasso or Coach Beard as your FUT club's manager. All the AFC Richmond content in FUT will be obtainable through objectives and challenges.\nYou can see Ted Lasso and the AFC Richmond squad in action through the trailer below.\n\n\nFIFA 23 arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4. Xbox One, PC, and Stadia on September 30.",

Square Enix read my mind by announcing a remaster of Zack Fair’s PSP adventure, christening it with the subtitle “Reunion,” giving newcomers the answer to the question of “who the heck was that black-haired fella in Remake?” As for me, I thought I had a good reason to return to the game. After playing a decent chunk of Reunion at Tokyo Game Show, I’m all good. \nMy expectations were always reasonable. Reunion is a remaster, not a remake the scale of, well, Remake. That means that feature-wise, the best way to sum it up is “That PSP game? You can pl…",

          "description": "Let me fill you in on a little secret most people won't tell you: the real way to enjoy a video game show is at home, comfortably on your couch, watching the event on YouTube. \nOver the years, the game press has done a remarkable job tricking you into thinking otherwise. The shows look extravagant, energetic, and almost like we're getting glimpses into the future, which we then curate into bite-sized news stories and on-demand trailers for our faithful readers back home. \nThe reality is much more depressing.\nWhether it's E3, PAX, Gamescom, or in this case, Tokyo Game Show, going to a video game trade event means dealing with the near-lethal combination of jetlag and overwork. The brutal FOMO of being in some of the coolest cities in the world but spending all your time in convention halls. The unbelievable cacophony of thousands of people talking at once. The unbelievable smells of thousands of people all standing too close to each other. The never-ending lines of thousands of people all needing to use the toilet at the same time. This doesn't even touch on the unavoidable safety concerns of having a video game conference in the midst of an ongoing pandemic. But I digress.\nAll that said, there's some fun stuff to look at, like big, gaudy statues and giant booths that likely cost tens of thousands of dollars for games you've never heard of and likely will never play. Stuff that really makes it all worth it. \nWhile we'd love to fly each and every one of you out to Tokyo, sadly, we only had the budget to fly out two of our full-time employees. So in lieu of attending yourself, please enjoy my curated batch of pictures of what I saw on the show floor. \nWell, there you have it, folks. All the fun of TGS without actually being there. See you next year!",

Now, we know when we can play it because Saturnalia has captured an October 27 release date. \nThat's when it will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via the Epic Games Store). Developed by Italy-based studio Santa Ragione, the team behind games like Fotonica, MirrorMoon EP, and Wheels of Aurelia, Saturnalia is shaping up to be a great time. You can find out why in the New Gameplay Today segment we recorded that's all about Saturnalia, featuring more than 15 minutes of gameplay, below: \n\n\n\"[Saturnalia] is a kaleidoscopic adventure inspired in equal parts by authentic Sardinian folklore and classic Italian Giallo horror films,\" a press release reads. \"The story involves a mysterious, centuries-old ritual that occurs every year on the night of the winter solstice in the Italian village of Gravoi. Each of the game's four playable characters must utilize their unique abilities and confront their own personal revelations in order to expose the secrets haunting the town and ultimately escape their doom.\"\nHere are some additional Saturnalia highlights from Santa Ragione: \nSeek clues in a maze-like village with no markers or compass to guide your steps.\nExplore the ever-changing town of Gravoi using matches to keep the dark at bay.\nFlight and stealth are your only options, as you cannot fight the creature that hunts you.\nImmerse yourself in the stop-motion animation and vibrant expressionist art style of Saturnalia for an eerily beautiful atmosphere that is as enthralling as it is chilling.\nControl your fate through non-linear progression and a dynamic, adaptive narrative, with unique endgames dependent on player choices.\n\n\nSaturnalia hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC via the Epic Games Store on October 27. \nAre you going to check this game out?

          "description": "Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has announced that its Yakuza-adjacent Judgment series will make its way to Steam for the first time. The best news: they're out on Steam today.\nJudgment and Lost Judgment come to Steam on September 14. This marks the first appearance of each game on PC (though Judgment has been available to stream on PC via Stadia). \nThis news is especially significant given that RGG Studio originally planned to release Lost Judgment on PC when it launched last year. However, that version was nixed when the talent agency representing actor Takuya Kimura, who portrays protagonist Takayuki Yagami, enforced strict policies about allowing Kimura’s likeness on PC. Both parties' inability to agree threatened Judgment’s future as a franchise since RGG Studio has pushed for more of its titles to come to Steam; every mainline Yakuza game is available on the storefront, for example. It would appear those issues have been ironed out, which bodes well for the potential of a third game. \nThe Judgment games are noir action thrillers that adhere to the same open-world design template as the Yakuza series. Though the plots largely unfold in Kamurocho, the series stars a new cast of characters and emphasizes investigative gameplay. Players control Yagami, a disgraced lawyer and private detective who works to unravel a pair of conspiracy plots. In Yakuza fashion, he also has his hands full helping his colorful clients and random citizens solve more light-hearted – or comically absurd – problems. \nTo learn more about each title, you can read our reviews for Judgment here and Lost Judgment here.",

That reveal trailer looked great, but it was short and sweet. \nNow, RGG has released a new \"Ambush\" trailer that showcases more than five minutes of Like A Dragon: Ishin, giving us a better look at this upcoming Yakuza spinoff. Like A Dragon: Ishin was first released on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3 in 2014, but it never came out in the West. This new release rebuilds Like A Dragon: Ishin from the ground up, and you can check out how great it's looking in the trailer below: \n\n\nLike A Dragon: Ishin takes place in the Late Edo Period of Japan, in the 1860s. After completing his special sword training, Sakamoto Ryoma returns to his home in Tosa, only to find conflict against a prestigious samurai. You can read more about it in our story here.\nLike A Dragon: Ishin hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on February 21.",

Check out the Like A Dragon 8 reveal trailer for yourself below:\n\n\nAs you can see, the former protagonist of Yakuza, Kazuma Kiryu, is back. He was the protagonist in the first six Yakuza games, and now he's back in Like A Dragon 8. Ichiban tells Kiryu it's Hero time – remember, he's a big fan of the Dragon Quest series which stars plenty of heroes – before the trailer cuts to both of their faces, revealing that some time has passed, with both characters looking at least a little older than when we last saw them. \nLike A Dragon 8 is due out PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC sometime in 2024. \nIn the meantime, read about Like A Dragon: Ishin, a Yakuza spinoff first released on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3 in 2014 finally making its way to the West, rebuilt from the ground up, next year.",

          "description": "Sony revealed a brand new story trailer for God Of War Ragnarök during today’s State Of Play stream. The video showcased otherworldly imagery, including astral jellyfish, giant dinosaur-like creatures, and notably, a pivotal scene wherein Atreus appears to usher in Fimbulwinter, the end of the world, alongside Sköll and Hati – two wolves that are the offspring of Fenrir. According to Norse mythology, Sköll and Hati are two wolves who exist to one day spark the beginning of Ragnarök by chasing and devouring the sun and the moon. It’s pretty clear that’s what is happening in this new trailer, but why is Atreus helping them?\nAdditionally, it seems Atreus is hiding critical information from his father, Kratos, so why is Kratos following orders from his teenage son? Why is Freya holding a sword up to Atreus’ throat in the trailer? Is she holding Atreus hostage or trying to show Kratos the same pain she suffered after her son Baldur was killed in the first game? The trailer creates more questions than answers, precisely what I want from pre-launch marketing. \n\n\nWe’ll have to wait to find the answers to these questions when God Of War Ragnarök releases on November 8. In the meantime, let me know your story theories in the comments below!",

However, it's been a long time since the game has been playable on modern consoles. That changes soon, as the revolutionary first-person shooter received a duo of announcements today. First, we learned about a Switch version as part of the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack N64 catalog. However, we also learned the title (which was developed by now-Microsoft-owned Rare), is also coming to Xbox as a part of Game Pass and Rare Replay.\nWhen the game arrives on Xbox, it will include the classic campaign, complete with the original difficulty settings and cheat codes (no word on if \"DK Mode\" will be renamed to something more generic like \"Big Head Mode\" for the Xbox version). The Xbox version will also include the split-screen local competitive multiplayer mode that made the game such a mainstay for get-togethers in the N64 era.\n\n\nUnfortunately, it does not appear as though the online multiplayer available in the Nintendo Switch Online version will make the jump to the Xbox version. However, the Xbox version of GoldenEye 007 does include improved control options (including dual analog stick support), native 16:9 resolution up to 4K Ultra HD, a consistent refresh rate, and full achievement support. \nGoldenEye 007 is coming to Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One as part of Game Pass. Everyone who already owns Rare Replay will also be able to download the game at no additional cost. We don't know exactly when GoldenEye 007 arrives on Xbox, but according to Rare, the game will land simultaneously on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch Online.",

          "description": "Dauntless developer Phoneix Labs has announced a new title that, needless to say, is dramatically different than its monster-slaying RPG. Fae Farm is a cozy life simulation that whisks players to a world of magic and wonder where you'll flex your green thumb as a farming savior. \n\n\nAs the name suggests, the bulk of the experience involves running a farm as an adventurer and newcomer to a community in the land of Azoria. Though you’ll work to bring peace to this troubled land, you’ll also kick back and leisurely explore various environments, collect resources, and build homesteads. Fae Farm is built with cooperation in mind. The title features drop-in/drop-out co-op, both locally and online, allowing players to farm and quest together. \n“With Fae Farm we wanted to take our favorite elements of the sim genres we love, infuse them with magic and beautiful art, and wrap everything in a light-hearted cooperative experience,” said creative director Katie De Sousa in a press release. “I can’t wait to see what kind of cozy homesteads players build in Azoria.”\nFae Farm is slated to release during Q2 2023 exclusively for Switch.",

Where could they be? More details about this new title for Nintendo Switch will be revealed ahead of its 2023 launch.\"\n\n \nPikmin is a very special franchise to many people, but despite its niche popularity, it's never quite reached the heights of other Nintendo franchises. In total, the franchise has sold more than 8 million copies. Pikmin 3 Deluxe on Switch proved the franchise still had some (fruit) juice in it by selling roughly 2 million units in less than a year – a quarter of the series' entire sales – and fans speculated this had proved to Nintendo that it was time for a proper sequel. \nPikmin 4 was mentioned by series creator Shigeru Miyamoto back in 2015 when he told Eurogamer that it was in development and \"very close to completion.\" Time passed and then Hey! Pikmin, a 2D Pikmin spinoff, was announced and then released in July of 2017. Some speculated that this was the Pikmin 4 Miyamoto was referring to back in 2015 but in June of that year, Miyamoto told Eurogamer that \"it is progressing,\" seemingly confirming that he did not view Hey! Pikmin as the fourth sequel. Unfortunately, that was the last Nintendo or anyone there referred to Pikmin 4...until today's Nintendo Direct!\n\nNintendo showcased a short and sweet teaser trailer that gave us more of the luscious world of Pikmin before flashing to a title screen that revealed Pikmin 4 is coming to Switch next year. As for exactly when, that remains unknown  – Nintendo simply stated 2023. But hey, that's better than wondering when, if ever, Pikmin 4 would actually come out! \nAre you excited for Pikmin 4?

All of its individual actions are things we’ve done in other games, but when applied to this distinct cooperative approach, they take on a whole new life and are used in wonderful ways over a long adventure.

CD Projekt Red's 2077 anime, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, developed by Studio Trigger and Netflix is out (as of today!) and the Phantom Liberty expansion for the game is due out next year. While Phantom Liberty has been confirmed to be 2077's first and only expansion, it seems CDPR is not yet ready to part with this world. \nDuring the CD Projekt Group H1 2022 earnings call, CDPR's vice president of business development Michał Nowakowski said the studio is committed to doing more with this IP, as reported by IGN. \n\n\n\"We decided to develop one major expansion for Cyberpunk, which is going to take advantage of all the capabilities of the new-gen consoles,\" Nowakowski said during the call. \"Having said that, we're totally, fully committed to developing the Cyberpunk IP further, beyond this particular Cyberpunk expansion. We've put a lot of effort and time into building this franchise and we definitely want to continue to build upon what was built right now – with new stories, new experiences, new content, basically. Not just the video game format...in terms of expansions, there's just going to be one major expansion. However, there's going to be new stuff in the future.\" \nAs for what exactly, only time will tell but considering a Cyberpunk 2077 anime is already out, perhaps the studio is looking to dive more into the entertainment medium with this IP. As IGN notes, there's also The Molasses Flood, a Boston-based studio that CDPR acquired earlier this year, which is working on an existing CDPR IP. This could be something related to The Witcher, of course, but perhaps it's something related to 2077. \nIn the meantime, read about why now is the right time to play Cyberpunk 2077 and then read about what to expect in next year's Phantom Liberty expansion. \n[Source: IGN]\nHow should CDPR further develop its Cyberpunk IP?
