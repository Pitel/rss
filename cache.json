          "description": "Prematurely hatched.\nEver since Nintendo gave players the tools to develop their own levels with Super Mario Maker, there’s been talk about the Big N expanding the concept to other franchises, especially Zelda. This was allegedly discussed at greater length behind the scenes and eventually led to the addition of the Chamber Dungeons concept in the Link’s Awakening Switch remake, but there seemingly wasn’t enough will or interest to see it through to a fuller product, as we haven’t seen anything come to fruition yet. Spotting an opportunity to capitalize on the potential of this idea, an indie team called Firechick launched and successfully funded a Kickstarter late last year for a legally distinct top-down Zelda-style dungeon builder called Super Dungeon Maker. Now that it’s come to Switch, we can report that it’s a decent foundation, though it feels unfinished at launch and there’s clear room for improvement here.\nFirst, a brief overview. This is a game that apes the gameplay of the Game Boy and SNES Zelda games as closely as possible, right down to that annoying worm boss that spins in circles in a cramped room. Instead of playing as Link, you play as a chicken named Fink who has the same basic sword and shield alongside a small arsenal of tools like a hookshot or bombs. Using these, you navigate dungeons, solve puzzles, and kill baddies, all in the quest to find the golden egg at the end of each dungeon.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Sure, we imagine that there are going to be a fair number of tweaks (hi Sky Islands!), but it looks like the basic skeleton is the same. So, what's the best way to prepare for this return? Replay the first game? Stare longingly at the map? Get yourself a horse and head out on a real-life adventure on your own? You could do all of the above, or you could have a crack at HyruleGuessr, a BOTW-set map quiz (thanks, Polygon) — it's your call...\nAs the name suggests, this is a twist on the original Geoguessr game, where you are dropped at a random spot in the world (via Google Street View, not literally) before having to guess your location based on clues like road markings, street signs and nearby landmarks.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It's the first project to hatch from Bohemia's incubator program, which helps indie devs make cool games.\nSilica is largely the work of one developer, Martin \"Dram\" Malicharek, who was previously the lead on Bohemia's Take On Mars.

Plenty of options, for sure, but Persona 3 Portable was the last time we could choose our protagonist’s gender in the series. Until now.

When you and your squad head back to your Abbey HQ, there are side stories and quests to investigate around the Abbey grounds, items to find, and more. It's a sizable part of the game, but at one point it was even bigger, creative director Jake Solomon tells me at GDC. \n\"It's crazy, if you go online, you can see all the Midnight Suns cutscenes and they're three hours long. That's as long as a movie,\" he says. But during the last year of development Solomon reveals \"we cut 30 conversations from the game, like 30 scenes. We cut a ton, because we realised this is just simply too much.\"\nRead more",

I was all about the chocolate. Sure, I’d crack open the yellow canister inside, let out some variation of, “Oh, an elephant!”, and promptly toss it in the bin and walk away, its destiny consigned to landfill. In the landfill of my brain, I’m currently carving out new space for Street Fighter 6’s World Tour mode. It's available to try now in demo form on PC and consoles, but I've been able to play a larger build of it that covered the first two chapters. Sadly, I can't say it left much of impression.\nIn case you're equally bemused by what SF6's World Tour actually is, this is a new, open world, RPG-style mode in which you make a custom fighter, run around small areas of Metro City and other locations around the globe, and level up. There are moves to learn, side quests to complete, and you can even do mini-game activities such as making pizza. Between all of that, you fight people. Other fighters, unruly gang members, random folk making their way to work in the morning. You can punch almost all of ‘em! There’s a glimpse of the Street Fighter you know and love here with its side-on 1v1 bouts, but everything else around it is unnecessary fluff. In other words, World Tour is the token toy inside the more delicious Street Fighter chocolate. \nRead more",

It also introduces a cool pin feature that lets you stick overlay windows on top of your game - handy if you're following a guide, say, and don't want to keep alt-tabbing out. But there's one thing I'm quite upset about, and that's the new Notes app. I love a good notebook game, you know? Fiddling out puzzles in Tunic, remembering patterns in The Witness...

Sluggishness and stuttering are problems on higher-end graphics cards, even before adding the strain of ray tracing effects, and FSR upscaling often fails to deliver a significant performance boost.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's well-known now that the delay was simply about polishing the game rather than anything more drastic, but to Solomon's credit he does also concede that he was perhaps \"a little naïve\" at the time for thinking it would go down without question.\nRead more",

Played less intensely over a longer period, I imagine more of its intricacies becoming clear, and more custom playstyles emerging to encourage more replays and challenges. As it stands though, its generally high quality and interesting systems just haven't captured my imagination.\nIt is not unimaginative, though. Some of its playable races are the usual elves and goblins, but most have a twist, like the cannibalistic dwarves, gold-obsessed necromancers, or the \"cursed toadlings\" I picked almost reflexively: a people transformed along with their warrior Queen Charming. Each comes with a starting hero and traits for their cities units, plus a set of spellbooks that determine what research you'll have access to upfront.\nRead more",

I see a flicker of anger in her eyes, as well as maybe, just maybe, a spark of interest.\r\n\n\r\nA new Dota patch came out last week, and it’s a biggun. Is it a good time for lapsed players to jump back in? Yes! Is it a good time for entirely new players to dip their toes in, while experienced players are still befuddled by a map that’s 40% bigger, featuring dual Roshan pits, new minibosses and a host of other changes?

          "description": "When I meet Jake Solomon at GDC, it's his third day of unemployment. The XCOM and Marvel's Midnight Suns director and designer announced he was leaving Firaxis back in February, but his final day at the studio where he made his name and worked for more than twenty years was still very fresh in his memory. \"It's surreal,\" he says. \"For probably the next ten years, I'll refer to it as 'we' when we talk about Firaxis, and it's sad to think it's not the right pronoun anymore. It's exciting, but a little terrifying.\"\nOn the face of it, that panic might seem unfounded. Over the last decade, Solomon has become one of the most revered names in turn-based strategy games. Having cut his teeth on many of Sid Meier's Civilization games in his early years at Firaxis, he went on to become the designer who spearheaded the revival of XCOM with Enemy Unknown in 2012, before going on to direct its even more beloved sequel XCOM 2 and its War Of The Chosen expansion a few years later. Most recently, he was creative director on Marvel's Midnight Suns, which allowed him to marry his life-long love of Marvel comic books with the thrilling tactical combat he's so well known for. \nSolomon's next adventure, though, won't have the certainty of Midnight Suns' supercharged attack cards, or even the tease of an XCOM hit percentage backing him up. For not only is it Solomon's third day of unemployment when we speak; it's also the day after he revealed his plans to leave turn-based tactics games behind altogether. Instead, his sights are now set on the life simulation genre, a move that, at first glance, seems at odds with his career as a strategy designer. But over the course of our hour-long chat, it becomes increasingly clear that life sims have been a life-long obsession for Solomon, and he might have even made one by now had the development of XCOM 2 gone a little differently. \nRead more",

Somehow, despite being primed by the excellent time I had with its demo five years ago, I just bounced off this one. I very quickly got stuck in a frustrating loop of fatally ballsing up no matter what I did - presumably I badly biffed my stats right out the gate to get soft-locked in the first area - and despite deciding I'd restart in a day or two, several years later my play-time hasn't extended past that first session. Sad times all round, I'm sure you'll agree, but what's it got to do with Betrayal At Club Low?\nWell, when I picked up Betrayal At Club Low for the RPS Game Club this month, I was transported back to my abortive run at Disco Elysium. It's not that I've never played a stat-check-heavy RPG before. Far from it. But somehow, each game's presentation resonated together in my weird brain mush. It must have been something to do with the combination of a surreal, seedy, not-quite-our-world-but-still-very-recognisable setting, and the constant presence of numbers reminding me of my character's strengths stacked up against their many, many weaknesses.\nRead more",

My favourite detail is that you can become a werewolf and “do werewolf things”. Although getting to that stage may take a while, as associate game director Joseph Piepora recently said it would take around 150+ hours for an average player to hit the Level 100 cap. Sounds like a week’s worth of content then.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "For all its flamingo thigh stews, misshapen clothes model characters and pizza-themed DJ-ing, Betrayal At Club Low is an old-school, dice-throwing RPG through and through. Every interaction you have at Club Low is determined by the rolling of dice, whether it's simply attempting to spark a conversation with a hard-of-hearing bartender, or bluffing your way into VIP backrooms where your blown fellow agent Gemini Jay is currently being grilled by the intimidating Big Mo. \nWhether you're successful in your endeavours depends on whether you can roll higher or equal to whatever value is thrown by your opponent, with each face corresponding to a particular Skill Dice you're trying to deploy to win that scenario. A lot of the time, your skill numbers aren't nearly good enough to beat your fellow clubber outright, but for me, the thrill of Club Low comes from clinching a very plain, and highly unremarkable draw, earning you the accolade of 'Success. Barely' in the ensuing results breakdown. It may not sound very sexy, but in a world where the odds are fully stacked against you, barely succeeding will do me just fine here, thanks.\nRead more",

          "description": "Knowing that wombats' dump is little stackable cubes was one of the fun facts I learned at school (it was either a rhetorical proof for or against the existence of God; I forget which). This knowledge comes in handy for understanding the game Hardhat Wombat, coming from George Fan (of Plants Vs. Zombies fame), with Andy Hull (of programmer on Spelunky fame). Out later this year, it's a combination puzzle-platformer and conscruction game in which you play a wombat, wearing a hard hat, who constructs increasingly complex things out of his own feces. That is no way to make a skyscraper, wombat.\nRead more",

Every month*, I'm going to be spending some time highlighting a cool indie game that deserves your attention. Think of this series as a supplement to Sin's Scout Report or our Indiescovery podcast. A brand new method for delivering piping hot recs from my desktop to yours.\nMy aim is to use this series as a springboard to dive deep into specific elements of a game I find particularly fascinating, sharing my discoveries with you lot behind the paywall first (and don't worry, regular readers, I'll also be making each of these videos public for all to see after a month, which should roughly coincide with the the next one going live for supporters). In it, I'll be discussing some common themes between multiple games, digging into underappreciated gems from years gone by... The remit is broad and nebulous, to the point where it's clearly obvious why I haven't been able to come up with a name for it yet.\r\n\n(If you end up thinking of something, please do let me know in the comments. More than anything it'll stop me messaging Katharine a list of awful possibilites every other week, which I can only imagine is negatively effecting her feelings about me, the site and the endeavour of games journalism in general. They really have been that bad, folks. Proper rancid stuff).\nRead more",

Announced back in 2021, the app has been in open beta for a little while now and is finally setting a full launch date.\nPokemon TCG Live can be picked up through the App Store, Google Play Store, or the TCG website for their respective platforms. The company is also hosting a celebration ahead of next expansion's launch. Paldea Evolved will be playable starting on June 8 in TCG Live, but players who log in between May 2 and June 6 will get some special accessories and cosmetics.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ooBE5AQODY\nThis also means the original Pokemon Trading Card Game Online app will be removed from mobile and PC on June 5, at 9 a.m. PT. Accounts use the same Trainer club account log-in, and you can read up on how to migrate those over here.\nThe heart of the cards\nAs someone who already collects Pokemon cards but doesn't really play the actual competitive card game (I just like the cool art, okay), this update feels a little targeted at me. I've only played a little bit of TCG Live, but it's definitely a visual upgrade, and there are systems in place to encourage learning.\nI'm still hungry for the days of the Pokemon Trading Card Game on the Game Boy, which Arceus willing, will hit Nintendo Switch Online at some point. But hey, maybe I'll run a bunch of code cards through the TCG Live service and see if I can rekindle the card game flame.\nThe post Pokémon TCG Live officially launches in June appeared first on Destructoid.",

Sunshine Shuffle, the narrative poker game from the creators of An Airport for Aliens Currently Run by Dogs, is on its way for a May 24, 2023 release date.\nSunshine Shuffle is a fusion of storytelling and poker. You climb aboard the S.S. Sunshine and play poker with a capybara and other less interesting critters. The twist is that these cute creatures took part in a bank heist. As long as you pony up and put your chips on the line, they’re willing to let you in on the details.\nhttps://youtu.be/ts-bYpfXiCc\nAs a warning, the soundtrack apparently consists of ska. I don’t have an issue with the genre, but some people talk about it like it’s an auditory disease. I’d probably start breaking things if a game played modern, pop-country at me, so I feel a warning is fair.\nI like the idea of a narrative poker game more so than I would a game that is just poker. Years of rotting my brain with video games means I can’t sit still for ten seconds without ample visual feedback. Poker Night at the Inventory toyed around with the idea by having various video game and video game adjacent characters banter at the table. Additionally, I’d really like to know how such a regal, perfect creature like the capybara could be driven to crime.\nYou can find out all the sordid details in Sunshine Shuffle on May 24, 2023 on PC or Switch.

          "description": "He probably thinks he's a real cowboy...\nIf you remember that a new Saints Row game came out in the summer of last year, then you might be pleased to hear that the open-world adventure's first DLC expansion will finally arrive next week, nine months on from the game's initial release on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.\nThe Heist and The Hazardous — which hits all platforms on May 9 — will see our uber-trendy gangsters on a mission of vengeance, tracking down the double-crossing Hollywood star Chris Hardy following a botched assignment. The expansion will feature new in-game events, story missions, and a wardrobe full of new clothing, weapons, and other related chicanery. The Heist and The Hazardous is the first of three paid DLC expansions planned for the title in 2023.\nhttps://twitter.com/SaintsRow/status/1653399037180010500?s=20\nSaints Row, which launched last August after being delayed from its initial spring release date, saw the tongue-in-cheek crime franchise rebooted with an oddly elite fashion aesthetic and a cast of younger, entrepreneurial stars. While the game itself was serviceable, with high-octane action and an appetite for destruction, many critics and fans were non-plussed at the reboot's general vibe, complaining about a dated mission design, obnoxious and offputting dialogue, as well as a slew of technical issues.\nDeveloper Volition has been releasing updates to correct the latter problems, which has led to this long delay between launch and DLC drops. Soon after release, it was announced that Volition was being transferred from Deep Silver to another Embracer Group publisher, Gearbox Entertainment.\nSaints Row is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox. But not Stadia. Not anymore.\nThe post Saints Row DLC, The Heist and The Hazardous, finally arrives next week appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Hope there's a Homer comeback\nSquare Enix has announced a release date for In Tanta We Trust, the DLC expansion for its mythical adventure title Forspoken — The new campaign content will arrive May 26 on PC and PS5.\nWhile the action-packed trailer doesn't offer much in the way of context, we can see that Frey Holland, now truly coming to terms with the incredible powers afforded her in the kingdom of Athia, has been seemingly joined on the battlefield by no less than Tanta Cinta herself. The two magic-infused warriors will face new enemies and threats as they search for a way to purge Athia of the energy-sucking anomaly known as \"The Break\". Players can expect an extension to Athia's already huge map, as well as new spells, skills, friends and foes. Will we get new cat familiars? I hope so.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uc1xcGp1PyM&ab_channel=SquareEnix\nAm I going to die on the Forspoken defense hill? No, I am not, the moment has passed and fate has made its decision. But that doesn't mean that I agree with all of the flack directed towards what was, essentially, a perfectly fine adventure with some excellent stand-out setpieces and some lovely world and character design. While hardly the most original of open-world adventures, I really liked the synergetic combat, I really liked the costuming and special effects, and... fact is... I really liked Frey.\nIn Tanta We Trust will, quite possibly, be the last we ever hear from the Forspoken franchise, given its disappointing sales, and combined with the fact that developer Luminous Productions has essentially been assimilated into Square Enix proper. If so, I hope that Frey, Athia, and, of course, Homer, are all given a fitting finale that sends the audience home happy.\nForspoken is available now on PS5 and PC. In Tanta We Trust will launch on May 26.\nThe post Forspoken DLC In Tanta We Trust swings in May 26 appeared first on Destructoid.",

It will stream out over Twitch, YouTube, and Facebook, and have an ASL stream option available as well.\nhttps://twitter.com/Xbox/status/1653754086372818944\nWhat's it showing? Well, for the Xbox Games Showcase, Microsoft is making it sound like there will be some announcements. There will be \"new surprises and first-looks\" from its internal studios, as well as partners from around the world. The showcase will also discuss games coming to Xbox, PC, and to Game Pass.\nAs for the Starfield Direct, well, it's going to be about Starfield. Bethesda's big RPG is still a ways off, but getting closer every day. Xbox says there will be tons of new gameplay and developer interviews.\nThen, on June 13, Microsoft will air the Xbox Games Showcase Extended at 10 a.m. PT / 1 p.m. ET. This stream will host some interviews based around the news from the showcase,  as well as game updates.\nThe summer game showcases draw near\nWe're only a few days into May, but the time period for summer streams and news is now just a month away. The PC Gaming Show is set to follow right after the Xbox showcase, Ubisoft is airing its 2023 Forward the day after, and the Summer Game Fest kick-off stream will air on June 8.\nThough Nintendo, Sony, and a few other companies still have yet to lock in any summer plans as of this writing, the summer's already starting to stack up. Even in a year without E3, it seems like June will have some news and announcements in store.\nIt will be interesting to see what Xbox brings to its summer games showcase event, especially as Redfall didn't land quite so well for some folks.

          "description": "Hug a tree\nTHQ Nordic has announced that furry open-world exploration game Biomutant will be coming to Switch on November 30, 2023.\nBiomutant originally launched on other platforms on May 21, 2021. It drops you and your hideously ugly fursona in a post-apocalyptic world where your goal is to maybe save the world tree if you think that’s a good idea. For the most part, it was very open-world and put an emphasis on crafting and exploration.\nI liked it. Maybe one of the few, I think. I enjoyed the exploration, thought the world presented a nice amount of variety, and the crafting system is one of the best I’ve seen. Not only could you build weapons, you could take them apart and make them into better weapons. I don’t need to excuse myself for liking a game that other people bounced off of, but if I wanted to, 2021 was absolutely depressing. Any spark of joy just glowed brighter.\nI’m not really sure how this is going to look on Switch. It uses Unreal Engine 4, which has built-in compatibility with the Switch. However, I feel like you’re going to need to substantially cut back on the vegetation and fur, and I’m not sure a naked version of Biomutant is going to look so hot. Still, gameplay-wise, it should be the same. We’re pretty far removed from the days when games needed to be scaled back to fit on handheld.\nBiomutant is currently available on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. It will be coming to Switch on November 30, 2023.\nThe post Biomutant mutates on Switch November 30 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Marian joins the brothers, after becoming tired of bad guys constantly carrying her off. Meanwhile, I hope Uncle Matin is actually their uncle. There’s reportedly going to be a total of 13 playable characters, but the gameplay only supports two-player local coop. That’s probably a bummer for a lot of people, but I’m okay with it. I don’t like playing games with people who are out of Charlie Horse range.\nThe big combat change here is that it’s all “tag team combat.” You select two characters and can switch between them freely. There are co-op combos and other moves to pull off between your pair.\nhttps://youtu.be/TVvlBr6hVXA\nSecret Base is best known for Streets of Red: Devil’s Dare Deluxe. They’re applying a twist to the main campaign of Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons. You select the order you'll tackle the levels, and that will affect the length and difficulty of the following stages. You can also gain cash by performing special KOs and upgrade your fighter.\nThis is, by my count, the dozenth return of the series following 2012’s Double Dragon Neon and 2017’s Double Dragon IV. Secret Base seems to be bringing their own style to the series, so it should stand out from other revivals.

Utilizing a top-down perspective and with a heavy emphasis on exploration, combat, and environmental interaction, Weird West was praised for its pulpy writing, creepy character design, and interesting world, though some of its action and technical elements gave critics pause.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NS3lzv0Nw4&ab_channel=DevolverDigital\nWeird West: Definitive Edition will see the game launch on modern platforms, boasting new 4K resolution options and running at 60 FPS.

Here's hoping, as Weird West is certainly charming in its own peculiar way, and any fans of alternate realities, old-school horror comics, or twin-stick action would do well to test the murky waters of Wolfeye's adventure.\nWeird West: Definitive Edition launches May 8 on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X.

From today's trailer, it looks like Ekko will be interacting with his future self, as well as rewinding time in the short-term too, in order to foil some catastrophe.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qqdGiHBStk\nConvergence's platforming and action also makes use of Ekko's unique time abilities. From gaining an advantage over foes to rewinding a missed jump, it definitely feels like something Prince of Persia: Sands of Time should be keeping an eye on.\nThe story follows Ekko through the undercity of Zaun too, so Arcane fans should get a little bit more out of this than other locales. But of course, there are champions to fight too. Alongside Ekko, three other champions have been confirmed: Jinx, Camille, and Warwick.\nTime after time\nIt feels like only yesterday that The Mageseeker, the latest Riot Forge production, came out. While that one followed the magical rebellion happening within Demacia, Ekko's exploits in Zaun will be a bit different, both in setting and gameplay.\nAll of these, as well as the upcoming Song of Nunu, are part of Riot Games' publishing arm Forge. The idea has been to expand the world of League of Legends through third-party projects, and so far, it seems like it's been doing alright. Games like The Mageseeker and Ruined King were solid, fresh approaches to Runeterra. Maybe the streak can keep up with Convergence.\nConvergence: A League of Legends Story goes live for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch on May 23.\nThe post Convergence: A League of Legends Story rewinds the clock on May 23 appeared first on Destructoid.",

The entire collection finally arrived on PlayStation and Nintendo Switch just last month, and consists of legendary releases Final Fantasy, Final Fantasy II, Final Fantasy III, Final Fantasy IV, Final Fantasy V and, you guessed it, Final Fantasy VI. The new console reports have received praise from both critics and fans alike.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bI80df5OrA&ab_channel=FINALFANTASY\nEach release sees the games that defined a genre sharpened up for modern displays, while retaining the nostalgic and warmth-inducing sprites and environments of their 8-bit and 16-bit roots, overseen by original artist Kazuko Shibuya. Audio has been restored by composer Nobuo Uematsu, and a fresh run of balance tweaks and bug fixes have been made to the releases, fixing issues that have existed — in some cases — for nigh-on four decades. The console editions of the games include the option to switch to each title's classic soundtrack, as well as utilize an easier-on-the-eyes \"pixel font\".\nThe Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster series is available now on PC, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, and iOS and Android platforms.\nThe post Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster series passes two million sales mark appeared first on Destructoid.",

The short-form horror game is due for release on PC sometime in 2023.\nThe twist in Sniper Killer is that you control both the eponymous sharpshooter and a detective trying to stop them. While the sniper has the goal of simply delivering high-caliber snacks into the faces of their victims, Detective Comardy is searching for clues and trying to end the killings. The information on it suggests that the detective is a past-his-prime burnout, which I can definitely relate to.\nhttps://youtu.be/Q4h117kC1J0\nThe last game from the duo was Night at the Gates of Hell, which was a fun, tacky zombie shooter. In my review, I noted that “It gives a strong impression that the developer had as much fun creating it as you will have playing it,” which is a sentiment that still sounds accurate to me.\nMeanwhile, Bloodwash was a slow-cooker slasher title. I found that one to be extremely inventive in that most of the game was spending time while waiting for your laundry to finish. You could literally just sit and wait. But it was more fun to wander around the shopping plaza, learning about the murders that have been going on.\nBeing the victim in short-form lo-fi horror risks getting stale after a few years of iterating on it. However, trying to solve the mystery while alternating as the cause of the mystery sounds absolutely fab to me.\nSniper Killer is coming to PC sometime in 2023.\nThe post Lo-fi horror Sniper Killer coming from creators of Bloodwash appeared first on Destructoid.",

It’s slated for a PC release in 2024.\nTimes & Galaxy casts you as the first-ever robot reporter. You’ll pick your story, do some interviews, and scoop your scoop. You then have to assemble the story yourself (not actually write it out). In order to impress your readers and, more importantly, your editors, you’ll be covering important topics such as cat shows and toy launches, and rubbing elbows with your co-workers between assignments.\nhttps://youtu.be/KMjufslCX0o\nThis feels a little close to home to me. That’s maybe because multiple writers on the Copychaser Games team worked in journalism. I hesitate to call myself a “journalist” because people like to hurt my feelings by putting that in quotation marks. Also because it implies a certain degree of professionalism that I don’t want to commit to. Otherwise, I’m afraid it will mean I might have to stop using the word “butthole” so often.\nTime & Galaxy looks fantastic, though. Beyond the colorful aesthetic, the awesome premise, and the excellent writing, the idea of having a machine try and write news has a lot of opportunity for satire. I mean, people are already talking about having AI take over the jobs of journalists. Is that what you really want? Robots know nothing about buttholes, and they definitely won’t overuse and misuse the word “scoop.” You come to me for that kind of \"quality\" content.\nTimes & Galaxy is currently only confirmed for PC, and it will be coming sometime in 2024.

But in both gameplay and technical aspects, it’s falling short of what I had hoped for.\nhttps://www.yo…",

          "description": "More slack in the line\nTeam17 has revealed the roadmap to Black Salt Games’ indie darling, Dredge, that continues through to the end of the year. While many additions could be considered “small,” it will conclude with paid DLC at the end of the year.\nFirst up, we’ve got map markers. I didn’t even realize they weren’t already in the game. I guess I just didn’t need them so hard that I never looked to see if they were there.\nNext up is a feature I always appreciate: a photo mode. It's always nice being able to set up the perfect visual. You’ll get this ability from a character in the game and can then use it to find new wildlife to snap photos of. As part of this update, you’ll be able to turn off the aggressive behavior of certain sea monsters. While I feel like vulnerability is sort of central to the horror of Dredge, it will be helpful for anyone who just wants to explore without being harrowed.\nIn Q3, the Dredge team will be adding boat customization. Once again, I didn't necessarily look for this while playing, but I always love new ways to get creative. This will come in the form of paint schemes and flags.\nLife at sea\nFinally, at the end of the year, Black Salt Games will release paid DLC for Dredge. The DLC will center around a mysterious corporation known as Ironhaven. While they claim to be simply investing in drilling operations to revitalize the area’s towns and settlements, their actual goals seem much more sinister. Nonetheless, you’ll be aiding them with building up their facilities while uncovering their secrets.\nWhile I wasn’t in love with Dredge, I appreciate it thematically. The paid DLC seems kind of cool, and I might be willing to check it out when it finally drops at the end of the year.\nIf you haven’t dropped anchor on Dredge, it’s available on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch.\nThe post Team17 reveals roadmap (seamap?) for Dredge updates appeared first on Destructoid.",

Hearing about 2004's Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel in the years since Fallout 3 introduced console players to the franchise, I thought it was going to be an abomination. If Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel (don’t get them confused) is the series’ black sheep, then surely Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel was the sibling that died early because it was born without a butthole.\nI was led to believe it was a barely related cash-in made by people who paid no care to the license it was based on.

This new co-op brawler is coming this summer and will revitalize the dormant series in a new tag-team-focused adventure.\nSet in New York City after it’s been destroyed by nuclear war, Billy and Jimmy must take back what remains from the violent gangs that have since taken over. They won’t be doing it alone, though. The game features 13 playable characters, including Marian, the brothers’ old love interest, who now packs a pistol to blast threats from afar, and newcomer Uncle Matin, a tank-like fighter with a riot shield. \n\n\nAccording to a press release, Double Dragon Gaiden boasts “seamless tag team abilities and a multitude of strategies for devastating combos, defensive and offensive moves.” Solo players can swap characters on the fly to switch between their individual skills, such as the offense-focused Jimmy and more defensive Billy. The game supports two-player local co-op at launch (online co-op is coming in a post-launch update). \nDouble Dragon Gaiden tasks players with toppling four gang leaders and features a unique dynamic mission select system. Missions can be tackled in any order, and this selection affects their length, difficulty, and the number of enemies that appear. Earning cash unlocks powerful special movies that instantly knock out enemies, and you can also obtain crowd control moves that can wipe out multiple foes. Other gameplay options include an adjustable difficulty, permadeath and infinite modes, and unlockable bonuses. \nDouble Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons is being developed by Secret Base and published by Modus Games. It's coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.",

          "description": "Redfall is now available for players worldwide, but unfortunately, I’ve only been playing for a few days and cannot provide a full review yet.\nWriting this Redfall review-in-progress is painful because Arkane Studios is one of my favorite game developers, and its new game is largely disappointing. While the open world is beautifully sculpted with intriguing vistas, it’s weirdly empty, often implying that the harbor town’s vampire usurpers invaded during the offseason. \nAs a whole, Redfall’s gameplay is unbalanced. Several puzzling decisions, like a lack of stealth takedowns or the inability to pause the game in single-player mode, are far from what I’d expect from an Arkane game. Rampant technical issues hinder the brighter moments of the experience, including frequent server crashes, inputs failing to work, NPCs and enemies spawning duplicate versions of themselves, and one very frustrating bug which prevents me from closing the world map and main menu in cooperative play. \nOn a positive note, I like the four launch protagonists, each with unique skills you can upgrade via a straightforward-but-effective skill tree. Also, a handful of weapons are neat, like the heavy-hitting stake launcher or ultra-violet raygun that turns vampires to stone. A few locations, like a deranged scientist’s mansion, a cliffside lighthouse, and a hangar repurposed as a prison quarter, provide enough challenge to incentivize intelligent pathfinding. Unfortunately, most locations and enemy placements feel haphazardly designed – certainly a byproduct of creating two open-world maps. \nHowever, my evaluation may change in the coming days. I’ve completed roughly 50 percent of the game and its first story arc, but I’ve only played for a few days and have more content to see.\n\nWe’re reviewing Redfall on PC. Here are our computer specs: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090, AMD Ryzen 9 5950X 16-Core Processor, 64GB RAM",

The PC version has been especially problematic, and Respawn is addressing these issues with a performance update. \nThe PC version of the game has reportedly been plagued with a variety of bugs and glitches, notably affecting frame rate. Today’s update, which is now live, is only stated as being “performance improvements for non-raytraced rendering\" in the patch notes. \nThat doesn’t seem like the most helpful update on the surface, but it's worth noting that the multiple improvements coming to the console versions, which are listed below, have already been implemented on PC:\nMultiple crashes fixed across PlayStation and Xbox Series X/S and various areas of the game.\nFixed crashes that were tied to skipping cinematics.\nPerformance improvements across PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.\nFixed an issue with dynamic cloth inside the Mantis\nFixed various rendering issues.\nFixed an issue with registered Nekko colors not saving.\nFixed an issue with registered Nekko disappearing from the stable.\nFixed issues with cinematic dialogue overlapping.\nFixed various collision issues.\nFixed an issue with enemy A.I. remaining in T Pose during photo mode.\nFixed a freeze that occasionally occurred while talking to Doma.\nFixed a bug where the BD-oil VFX did not properly render.\nFixed an issue where players were getting stuck inside the Chamber of Duality if you didn’t save after leaving the chamber and die. \nHopefully, today’s PC patch does some significant help, but if not, Respawn, at least has other updates in the works. If you’re playing on PC, how has your experience with Star Wars Jedi: Survivor been? Has today’s update helped at all? Let us know in the comments.",

Movie continues to be a massive success and became the first film of 2023 to leap past $1 billion at the global box office. \nThe film achieved this milestone on Sunday, less than a month after its U.S. premiere on April 5. According to Variety, the film has grossed $490 million in North America and $532 million internationally, adding up to rough total of over $1 billion. Despite a tepid critical reception, Illumination’s adaptation of Nintendo’s flagship franchise has already become the highest-grossing video game film ever, the highest opening weekend, and the top-grossing film of 2023 so far.  \nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie is also just the fifth movie to cross the billion-dollar threshold since the pandemic started. It joins the coveted ranks of Avatar: The Way of Water, Spider-Man: No Way Home, Top Gun: Maverick, and Jurassic World Dominion. \nFor more on The Super Mario Bros.

          "description": "Vampire Survivors is going Hollywood thanks to the announcement of an upcoming animated TV adaptation. \nDeveloper poncle has confirmed that it's working with gaming consulting company Robot Teddy and media company Story Kitchen to bring the hit arcade bullet hell game to the small screen. Story Kitchen is helmed by names such as Dmitri Johnson (co-producer of the Sonic the Hedgehog films), John Wick creator/writer Derek Kolstad, and APA agent Mike Goldberg. There’s currently no other details about what the series will entail, such as the cast or a premiere date. \n“The most important thing in Vampire Survivors is the story, so it's a dream come true to see what started as a little indie game I made on my weekends come to life as an animated TV show! It’s also great to be partnering up with such experienced and talented people to make the show. I do wonder if they've realised that there isn't a single vampire in Vampire Survivors, though,” says Luca Galante, founder of poncle in a press release.\nIf you're tilting your head wondering how a pixelated arcade game can be translated into a show, it's worth nothing that Vampire Survivors has been brought to life in animated form before. Its two expansions – Legacy of the Moonspell and the recently launched Tides of the Foscari – both featured slick animated trailers, so those could be reference points for how this series may potentially appear. \nVampire Survivors has been on quite a roll since it launched to widespread acclaim last year, scooping up several end-of-year awards and walking away with a couple of BAFTA trophies this year, including winning Best Game.

Plus, it uses Lumen global illumination (you might recognize the word \"Lumen\" from Epic Games' Unreal Engine showcase back in 2021), Niagara visual effects \"to create particle effects in real time\" and Action System Controls \"to improve the development process and optimization of all gameplay mechanics,\" according to a press release. \n\"Creating games with Unreal Engine 5 is a great opportunity for the whole team, as it means our game development process can skyrocket in quality,\" Anshar Studios lead programmer Tomasz Bilnicki writes in the press release. \"It has an incredible power when it comes to the implementation of dynamic lighting, shadows, and potentially beautiful worlds for players to explore.

Now, less than six months later, we have a release date, and it's probably sooner than you expected. \nThat's because Armored Core VI hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on August 25, 2023. From Software announced this out of nowhere with a surprise trailer today that runs more than three minutes long. It features plenty of flashy mech action and some teases about what might be going on in this beautiful (but distraught) sci-fi world. \nCheck out the new Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon is a drastic departure from the fantasy worlds of late that From Software has been creating, but this still looks decidedly From Software. And we can't wait to check it out in just a few months. \nThe trailer also reveals what you can expect from the game's various digital editions and the special Collector's Edition – check them both out below: \n\nArmored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon launches on August 25, 2023. While waiting to learn more, check out the reveal trailer from last December. Read about From Software's Shadow of the Erdtree expansion for Elden Ring after that. \nAre you picking up Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon this August? Let us know in the comments below!",

The launch trailer itself is more of what you'd expect from a Redfall trailer – vampires, cooperative action, special abilities, and plenty of FPS gunplay. Check it out for yourself below: \n\n\nFor more about Redfall, read about how the game will only launch with a Quality Mode (although a 60 FPS Performance Mode is planned for post-launch), and then read about how Microsoft canceled a PlayStation 5 version of Redfall after it acquired Arkane parent company Bethesda. Listen to our thoughts on the game after going hands-on with Redfall after that. \nRedfall launches on Xbox Series X/S and PC next Tuesday on May 2. \nAre you picking up Redfall next week?

          "description": "Microsoft has released its financial results for Q3 of its 2023 Fiscal Year, which consists of roughly January through March of this year. In it, the company revealed that Xbox hardware revenue is down but its Xbox content and services revenue is slightly up thanks to Xbox Game Pass subscription growth. \nMore specifically, Xbox hardware is down 30% and Xbox content and services is up 3%. Overall, Xbox's gaming revenue is down 4%, though. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says that the company set third-quarter records for monthly active users and devices, and that Xbox's gaming subscriptions (see: Game Pass) reached almost $1 billion this quarter. Despite this growth and revenue, though, Microsoft did not release new numbers regarding Game Pass subscription count – the latest count was 25 million in January 2022. \nAs for the dip in hardware revenue, Microsoft says the decline comes from the comparison of this quarter this year to the same quarter in the previous fiscal year, which gained a boost thanks to increased console supply. \nHere are some other numbers from Microsoft's financial results: \nRevenue was $52.9 billion, an increase of 7% (or 10% in constant currency)\nOperating income was $22.4 billion, an increase of 10% (or 15% in constant currency)\nNet income was $18.3 billion, an increase of 9% (or 14% in constant currency)\nXbox hardware revenue is down 30%\nXbox content and services revenue is up 3%\nOverall, Xbox gaming revenue is down 4%\nThese results arrived yesterday, shortly before the Competition and Markets Authority, a U.K. regulatory agency that serves the same purpose as the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S., blocked Microsoft's $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard today.

          "description": "Just a few days away from the launch of Horizon Forbidden West's Burning Shores DLC last week, Guerrilla Games has teased more adventures with Aloy. \nThis news comes from a statement released by the studio to announce that studio director and executive producer Angie Smets is leaving Guerrilla to serve as the head of development strategy for PlayStation Studios. It's a move similar to the one the team's former managing director, Hermen Hulst, made in 2019, transitioning from that director position to head of Sony Interactive Entertainment Worldwide Studios. \n\n\nWithin that statement, Guerrilla teases what could be Horizon 3 or at least, a third game in Aloy's world, as reported by PlayStation Lifestyle. \n\"We have full confidence in our new leadership as they steer Guerrilla towards a bright future, expanding the world of Horizon with Aloy's next adventure and our exciting online project,\" the statement reads. \nAs you can see, Guerrilla isn't trying to hide it – the studio has plans for another adventure with Aloy. And while rumors and speculation point to the \"exciting online project\" being some kind of multiplayer game within the Horizon world, this statement made sure to separate Aloy's next adventure and that online project. \nIn terms of the studio's new makeup, the management team now consists of studio and production director Joel Eschler, studio director and general manager Hella Schmidt, and studio and art director Jan-Bart van Beek. Technical director Michiel van der Lee will \"be focusing on the future technology and strategy for the Decima engine.\" \nThis statement also includes some words from Smets, who leaves Guerrilla after \"an incredible 20 years\" there: \nFor more about Horizon, read Game Informer's Horizon Forbidden West review. \n[Source: PlayStation Lifestyle]\nWhat do you think comes first?

Join us today Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central as we kick of the adventure, which will continue each week until we roll credits. We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel. \nBanjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.\nJoin me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey. \nWatch on Twitch!\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

While we knew there would be downloadable content, we now have a much better idea about the cadence with which the new characters will arrive.\n\"A big part of Street Fighter's charm is the cast of characters from around the world that appear in each game,\" executive producer Shuhei Matsumoto said during today's Street Fighter 6 Showcase livestream. \"We believe that Street Fighter is where players can take control of unique characters with their own awesome fighting styles. For the players – and for us as well – the appeal of the characters themselves is the most important element of the series. With Street Fighter 6, we're continuing development to deliver new characters to you every year.\"\nDuring Year 1, which kicks off when the game launches, we will receive four new characters to the Street Fighter 6 roster. Rashid, A.K.I., Ed, and Akuma are the characters who will be made available during this first year of content. Rashid, who debuted in the base version of Street Fighter V, arrives in summer 2023. A.K.I., an all-new character, will arrive in fall 2023. Ed, who debuted in Street Fighter IV but was first playable in Street Fighter V, arrives in the early parts of 2024. Akuma, the Great Demon who first appeared in Super Street Fighter II Turbo, joins Street Fighter 6 in spring 2024. These characters will also appear in World Tour, the single-player RPG-inspired story mode, giving players some insight into their backgrounds.\nIf you buy either the Deluxe ot Ultimate Editions, you get the Year 1 characters included in that version. Street Fighter 6 arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC on June 2.

You also get to see a little bit of puzzle-solving, which will also play a major role in the game.\n\n\nAlong with the gameplay footage, Ascendant also shared a video, seen below, highlighting some of the game's environments, which will be one of the first commercial games to use Unreal 5.1.\n\n\nFor a whole lot more on Immortals of Aveum, you can check out some hands-on impressions of the game resulting from a recent visit to Ascendant Studios here. You can also expect even more from our trip in an upcoming issue of Game Informer magazine.",

In her first adventure, Nancy seeks to uncover the killer of a high school student who seems to have been disliked by all of his classmates.\nYou will need the data files from the games’ original install CDs, and a fresh daily build of ScummVM. Apart from the original release, Secrets Can Kill’s Russian translation is also supported. The ScummVM wiki pages for The Vampire Diaries and Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill contain information on which datafiles are needed. Please, report any problems you encounter in our issue tracker.\n>",

          "description": "We are proud to announce that network-enabled Humongous Entertainment titles are now playable online! Anyone who has a copy of Backyard Football, Backyard Baseball 2001, and even Backyard Football 2002 (which was originally a LAN-only title) can download the latest daily build* of ScummVM and play online games against real people!\nThis all became possible because the three developers from the Backyard Sports Online fork had joined the team and brought their services with them to the ScummVM. These are LittleToonCat, Jim “jibbodahibbo” Westerkamp and Sam “QuestionMonkey” Kupfer.\nPlease note that Backyard Football and Backyard Baseball 2001 require online accounts for the complete online experience, so you need to register to Backyard Sports Online, which is our fantastic online-play service and a thriving community of fellow Backyard Sports players, they even have a couple of competitive online Baseball and Football leagues, if that's your style, you can find more information in their Discord server! People who already have a Backyard Sports Online account can log in using the latest daily build and play, but if you do not, you can register right here! This is not required to play Backyard Football 2002 online.\nIf you encounter any issues playing online, please let us know via the issue tracker.\nThis fantastic art is done by a fellow BSO community member Peppyrus.\n* only the Windows, macOS, Debian, Raspberry Pi, and Android builds are compatible with network play at the moment. And only the 2.8.x branch of ScummVM has this functionality.\n>",

          "description": "OpenTTD 13.0 has been out for two months and we’ve found some bugs to fix. Most notably, we’ve fixed two kinds of crashes: Road vehicles inside multi-track level crossings no longer crash into the side of trains. The game no longer crashes when a spectator in a network game tries to interact with a town’s local authority. For NewGRF authors using the new engine variant feature introduced in 13.0, we’ve added a callback to select how the engine’s name is displayed in the buy menu. As always, there are plenty of other bugfixes, which you can find in the changelog. Download Changelog Bug tracker",
