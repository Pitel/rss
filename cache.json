          "description": "Gotta scout 'em all.\nWhile Pokémon has long been the undisputed king of the monster-catching RPG niche, there have always been other releases that have offered up their own distinct take on that unique brand of recruitment gameplay. Megami Tensei, for example, pioneered the concept with ‘Demon Negotiation’ in 1987 and Dragon Quest took a crack at it with monster recruitment in Dragon Quest V in 1992, before expanding it into a sub-series with Dragon Quest Monsters in 1998.\nThough it always had its fans, Dragon Quest Monsters never quite found its feet in the West, and its popularity started to peter out even across its small handful of Japan-only releases in the last decade. After several years of letting the franchise cool, Square has now decided to bring the series back with Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince. While it may not quite be the roaring revival that longtime fans hoped it would be, this new release is nonetheless a fun and engaging new entry that we’d suggest you consider picking up.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

In Black Rapture, the Big Bang never happened.

          "description": "“Moebius built a world that doesn’t exist, but you can understand it. It’s a realist world. A world you can relate you, but it’s not your world,” says Edouard Caplain, art director for Jusant, the meditative tower climbing adventure that is Life Is Strange studio Don’t Nod’s latest game. Moebius was the pseudonym of French artist Jean Giraud, and whose surreal sci-fi and fantasy landscapes, with washes of contrasting colour and impossibly huge structures of soaring rock, have influenced games for years. You can certainly see that influence in Jusant, too: a world you can understand, though it's quite unlike your own. \nRPS slapped on the coveted Bestest Best sticker when reviewing it a few weeks back, calling it “a show don’t tell masterpiece”. A sentiment I can get behind as a long-standing proponent of silent games ever since the Evil Within 2 insisted on puncturing its creepy baroque ambience with consistently stupid dialogue. Jusant comes from a team that know how to write a conversation, though. So why the change of pace this time around?\r\n\n \nRead more",

Despite announcing they were shutting up shop following the release of this year's fantastic Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew, today marks the grand finale for their stealth strategy masterpiece in the form of a new free Treasure Hunt update, and the release of their two paid expansions. Each brings a brand-new pirate to The Red Marley's undead crew, as well as their own half-dozen story missions to play through spread across islands old and new, and once you've begun each of their respective questlines, they're readily available to play in any of the game's regular plunderings, too. \nMimimi have kept the identity of these pirates a secret until now, but after playing both DLCs for a big chunk of the last week, I'm confident in saying this is exactly the swansong Shadow Gambit deserves - with one of the expansions in particular bringing a poignant touch of coming full circle on Mimimi's work as a studio.

Then, between talk of it being set inside a cosmic uterus known as The Sarcophagus and having to use seeds and plants over successive runs to alter the shape of the map to your whim, it only became more intriguing. Now, after playing almost two hours of this Metroid-y roguelite for myself, there's still a lot about it to take in and digest, but holy moly what a thing to behold at the same time.

It turns out that trying to complete an estimated 100-hour RPG during the run-up to The Game Awards is too much for this humble Scriptor. There are still many more tabletop-style planetary maps to discover and plunder, many more character levels to scale, and many more cursed artefacts to tamper with before my protagonist, the closet Chaos worshipper Bruschetta de Plonque, can pronounce herself mistress of the Kronos Expanse - assuming the Inquisition doesn’t claim her first. But after 20 hours of the game, I can absolutely say that I’m looking forward to the next 80. While it doesn’t have the cinematic swagger and raw anecdote-generating capacity of obvious rival Baldur's Gate 3, Rogue Trader has mystique and depth to spare, both in terms of its grotty narrative and its exceedingly busy combat and levelling systems.\r\n \nRead more",

The jungles and the plains might be wonderful to look at, but they're too vast, filled with boring tasks, and overly reliant on level-gating to force a sense of progress. Sure, there's some spectacle in narrow escapes from the nasty humans - and their factories that make the plants droopy - but throughout the rebellion I ditched my bow for a shotgun with extended mags and a muzzle brake. For a game that's all, \"the humans are bad\", I was ready to defect. At least I would've been able to keep my shotgun.\nRead more",

I'm just here for the nice-looking flamingos, Rockstar, not a 24/7 twerk stream I can access from the palm of my hand. Of course, TV watching may yet have been preserved beyond what we've seen so far in the first trailer for GTA 6, but even if it's been consigned to the bin of modern history, there might yet be one light in the TikTok-esque darkness to make GTA 6's in-game social media network worthwhile. \nUpon closer inspection of the account names seen in the trailer, it's \"PlanetLeonidaMan\" that gives me hope, because if this isn't a riff on the Florida Man meme, I'll take a dump on a dead possum during rush hour traffic, hurl Oreos at Matthew as we argue over our empty coffee maker (teapot, come on), and try to cross the Atlantic in a hamster wheel vessel to demand some answers. \nRead more",

We may not all be not be naturally disposed to it, but there's much to be said for the fleeting, if unbridled happiness that comes from running barefoot into the teeth of the wind or getting caught in a rainstorm without a coat.\nNine times out of ten, you might get wet and have cold fingers, but that one time that you get wet, have cold fingers and feel red-raw and alive is a doozy. A Highland Song, a lone and dangerous jaunt through the Scottish highlands, is trying to capture that feeling, most especially in segments where you sprint across rocks and heather alongside a deer. At these times you leap in time to swelling music, and whoop and yell in spontaneous joy. It's lovely. It's also easy to stumble.\nRead more",

At the same time, the Meta's standalone headsets are by far the most popular PCVR devices. Therefore, most PCVR gamers will also have access to the Quest's handful of VR exclusives. Generally, this column sticks to covering games you can play with any PCVR headset, Quest or no. But since I reviewed the Meta Quest 3 last month, it feels odd not to check out at least one of its new titles, especially when it's probably the most notable VR release of the year – Assassin's Creed Nexus.\nAlso, I'll admit, a VR Assassin's Creed game intrigues me. The idea of cavorting across historical rooftops and shanking templars in the sternum sounds brilliant. It also sounds like barf city. Most VR games limit the need to move around as much as possible, so translating a game as kinetic as Assassin's Creed into VR seems mighty challenging.\nRead more",

          "description": "From one AMD CPU to another - the last deal we posted was on an AM4 gaming-focused processor, the 5800X3D, and now we're looking at the opposite end of Team Red's lineup: the 7950X. This Zen 4 design includes 16 cores and 32 threads, making it their ultimate consumer CPU for highly threaded workloads like video production, 3D rendering... and yes, many video games too! \nThis is still a pretty expensive processor, but it's a relative steal versus its launch price of £770. Amazon are now asking just £483 for this flagship-grade model, and that seems a fair price given just how well this CPU performs in everything from games to scientific computing and video rendering. \nRead more",

Only hang on, Ed thinks Enki is a squirrel, while Graham thinks it's a dog. Which of us is correct? Developer A44 Games describe Enki as \"fox-like\", further muddying the waters. There's only one thing for it: you'll have to watch the video and decide for yourself.\r\n \nRead more",

Very late: the evergreen free-to-play dark fantasy action-RPG launched literal generations ago in 2013, the heyday of Bioshock Infinite and GTA 5. (It's still arguably the heyday of GTA 5. Bioshock Infinite, not so much.) It's my understanding that New Zealand-based developer Grinding Gears have released approximately one bazillion Path of Exile updates and expansions in the decade since, the latest of which, Affliction, is briefly detailed in a boxout down the page. \r\n\n\r\nI am not your guy for blow-by-blow descriptions of what Affliction adds to Path of Exile. My cautious summary would be: lots of terrifying trees, and lots of modifiers. I am, however, your guy for a newcomer's snapshot verdict on the sequel ahead of the closed Path of Exile 2 beta on 7th June 2024. In a twist so far-fetched they might just pull it off, the new game is designed both for returning players and newcomers, and I think a lot of that is epitomised by the just-announced Mercenary class, which reflects game director Jonathan Rogers's desire to create combat mechanics that are at once more involved and more inviting.\r\n\n \nRead more",

One of them was Spine, an upcoming action game that asks the question: what if Sifu also had guns? The new gameplay trailer shows street artist heroine Redline punching, kicking and shooting her way through a cyberpunk-themed world of thugs and armoured guards, and her fancy footwork and the equally agile camera framing looks like it could be quite the combo when it eventually comes out in 2025. Alas, the trailer doesn't give away much else, but I spoke to developers Nekki ahead of tonight's showcase to find more about it, and how it's taking direct inspiration from Sifu and John Wick to become the next big cinematic beat 'em up.\nRead more",

Boldly disregarding the PR's gentle advice that I start with an easier-to-master race, I set out to swarm the galaxy and immediately found myself at the bottom of the victory or \"Succession\" point scoreboard, with one player picking off my planets by means of espionage, while others stomped my fleets of stargrubs flat in no-nonsense space combat. \r\n\n\r\nI did manage to briefly take possession of the titular Nexus, a throneworld which awards beaucoup Succession points to its owner, but it turns out fixating on the Nexus is a great way to set yourself up for a midgame dogpile - you pour resources into capturing it, sacrifice half your fleet to the first invader, then lose it all to the second. With my initially bountiful dominions rudely shrunk to a smattering of isolated planets, I took the coward's way out of the press event and said I had to be going because I had other work to attend to. I didn't at all! I just wanted to go and cry in the toilet. Alas for the Ix'Idar - not so much \"lions led by donkeys\" as an antfarm in the hands of a wilful toddler.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The HDR OLED display of the updated Steam Deck handheld game console is gorgeous and was very impressed by it.

          "description": "The latest Steam hardware survey has shown that previous Nvidia graphics cards are still very much in vogue when it comes to PC gaming. However, one of the lower-end 3000 series may be getting pushed aside to make room for a GPU that could be, inexplicably, worse.\n\n\nAccording to a report from Videocardz – which references the Chinese website Board Channels – Nvidia may be replacing its RTX 3050 card in favor of a similar one, but with less memory. It's been suggested that Team Green could opt to manufacture and sell a 3050 with 6GB of RAM instead of the 8GB it currently has.\n\n\nImage via Nvidia.\n\n\nQuite why this would be the case is not clear, but the report suggests it may be down to this older GPU \"impacting sales of the RTX 4060 too much.\" If the 3050 does get replaced with a lower spec version, it could be on the market by January, according to a Board Channels quote translated by Videocardz.\n\n\nThe usual tempering of expectations is recommended\n\n\nAs always with these things, it's best to take the information at face value for now. Until Nvidia confirms or denies these speculations, we have to assume that's what they are: just speculations.\n\n\nIt's believed that the RTX 3050 6GB card will still use the GA106 chip, but have a TDP of 75W. The current model has a TDP of 130W, so it's possible the rest of the hardware configurations will have a bit of a downgrade as well.\n\n\nAs I say, these details have yet to be confirmed so take them with a pinch of salt. Whatever reason Nvidia has for discontinuing an Ampere GPU and replacing it with a weaker model, it's best to hold off judgement until someone from the company addresses it. At the time of writing, Team Green has yet to comment.\n\nThe post Nvidia may be dropping the RTX 3050 in favor of a worse version appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Massive Monster is very slowly lifting the curtain of their upcoming Cult of the Lamb DLC, Sins of the Flesh. They will be showing off a teaser of the expansion every week until December 25. So we got one today (the 7th), which means we’re going to get (checks calendar) two more.\n\n\nThe gif animation we got today depicts the nudist ritual. Here you go, look at it.\n\n\nImage via Massive Monster\n\n\nThat’s all we’ve got. That is the new “all we know” about Sins of the Flesh.\n\n\nActually, no, not quite. On November 28, 2023, the Cult of the Lamb Twitter announced that if they passed the 300K follower mark, they would add sex into the game. They almost immediately gained an additional 100K followers, putting them well over the mark.\n\n\nThat means sex, right? Speaking to Polygon, the developers said, “We used games like Pokémon and The Sims when it comes to references, but put our own cult-ish spin on things. The age rating will not change.” So, that means, suggested sex, right? Like WooHoo from The Sims?\n\n\nYes! Maybe! Probably somewhat. Or possibly not at all…\n\n\nPosting on Steam Discussions (you owe me for delving into that cesspool), one of the developers states, “Hello! Here to soothe some worries. 'Sex Update' has become a bit of a meme in the community, one that a lot are really running with! But we have made sure all the new content (which is much more than what the keyart suggests) adheres to guidelines so the age rating should not change.”\n\n\nSo, what’s indicated here is that there will be some reference to sex, but you’ll probably still be able to play the incredibly family-friendly Cult of the Lamb in front of your mom. Unless the developers are just straight-up trolling us. It could be both! It’s probably both!\n\n\nCult of the Lamb is available for PC, Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. The Sins of the Flesh update is scheduled for early next year.\n\nThe post Cult of the Lamb is unveiling Sins of the Flesh DLC features, one gif at a time appeared first on Destructoid.",

With its fantasy folklore and cursed Ashlands, it's not a fictional universe ripe for December joy. But that doesn't mean you can't be an outlander and not get into the spirit of the season.\n\n\nTo get all of us in the mood for the holidays, Nexus Mods user Danae123 has created an in-game advent calendar for Morrowind. Consisting of one gift per day, it gives you the chance to have a little festive joy up to December 24.\n\n\nImage via Danae123/Nexus Mods.\n\n\nYes, I'm aware that we're now seven days into the month. That's on me for not spotting this sooner. But you can still claim a gift-a-day from a secret cabin for the rest of the time period.\n\n\nCandy canes and moon sugar\n\n\nFor obvious reasons, Danae123 doesn't say what the advent gifts are each day. You wouldn't want to spoil the surprise now, would you?\n\n\nAs for how you can collect your presents, when asked on the mod page, a user was told that it's a \"vanilla cabin on Solstheim that you are sent to during the Moon Sugar Mystery quest.\" Given this, you'll need to make sure you have the Bloodmoon expansion installed at the very least, as this is the only way to get access to the Morrowind island.\n\n\nWhile many are still playing Skyrim, it's nice to see that the classic Elder Scrolls games are still getting some love. They might not officially celebrate Christmas on the Dunmer island of Vvardenfell, but that shouldn't stop you from wearing a Christmas smile as you slash through Nix Hounds and bandits.\n\nThe post Have you opened your Morrowind Advent Calendar yet? appeared first on Destructoid.",

Streams for the track – first released in 1989 – have increased by 36,979%.\n\n\n\n\nYes, I had to do a double take as well, because that's a comma, not a period. Nearly a 37,000% uptick in one song's popularity is insane, but given the hype around the upcoming Grand Theft Auto entry, it's perhaps not too surprising.\n\n\nRock never dies\n\n\nAfter ten years of waiting, Rockstar finally gave us a taste of things to come in GTA 6. Sadly, we still have a bit longer to wait until it releases, as it's only due to come out in 2025. We don't even have an exact date. All we know is it'll be available on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. No word on when PC will get it, though.\n\n\nWith Tom Petty's song being given a new lease on life, it calls into question what other tracks will be in the game itself. As a series, Grand Theft Auto is known for its soundtrack, featuring a slew of classics from many artists and bands. \n\n\nOn a personal note: it absolutely blew my mind when I first heard Slayer's \"Raining Blood\" on Vice City's V-Rock station. Ah, good times.\n\nThe post GTA 6 trailer sees interest in Tom Petty soar on Spotify appeared first on Destructoid.",

This one is focused on Jeff Minter, entitled Llamasoft: The Jeff Minter Story.\n\n\nThe Gold Master Series officially started with The Making of Karateka, but the format was first piloted for Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration.

Titled Emergency Meeting, the DLC sees the survivors teaming up with the Among Us crewmates and fighting alien hordes.\n\n\nWhile Among Us is no stranger to crossovers, especially with other indie titles, Emergency Meeting marks Vampire Survivors' first crossover DLC. It's expansive too, adding eight playable characters, 15 weapons, and a new stage called Polus Replica.\n\n\nAs with the base game and other paid DLCs, Emergency Meeting is pretty affordable at $2.50. Fans won't have to wait long to play it either as it comes out on December 18 for PC and Xbox Series consoles. \n\n\n\n\nAlongside the blog post announcing the DLC, a trailer went live on poncle's YouTube page. It's pretty amazing, as several Vampire Survivors characters are transported to space and meet the Among Us cast. What ensures is a team-up to fend off thousands of angry aliens with planet-destroying powers.\n\n\nIt only slightly exaggerates the gameplay loop in Vampire Survivors, but it exemplifies the power trip that begins when equipped with all possible upgrades in a run. Honestly, I would have been happy with the crossover being just the trailer. An entire DLC paired with it is just the icing on the cake.\n\n\nAs unexpected as this crossover is, it looks like an absolute blast. This alongside patch 1.8 adding the narrative-based Adventures mode means Vampire Survivors fans are getting a significant amount of new content to chew through. \n\nThe post Vampire Survivors crosses over with Among Us on December 18 appeared first on Destructoid.",

It will be coming to PC sometime in 2024.\n\n\nHappy Broccoli Games has stated that Duck Detective: The Secret Salami is a 90-minute detective game, and that sounds perfect. It’s inspired by Return to the Obra Dinn and The Case of the Golden Idol, and has you, the eponymous duck, gathering clues, interviewing suspects, and putting the pieces together to find out who did the crime. What crime? Something to do with sausages. \n\n\n\n\nThat’s about all we’re told. It takes place in an office, so I assume someone ate their co-worker’s lunch. I cannot imagine ever doing that. I can’t imagine the kind of person who would. And yet, it happens. That’s so weird and maliciously inconsiderate. Who raised these people?\n\n\nI like the sudden surge of detective games in the indie and alternative markets. It has gotten to the point where I can’t keep up with them, but most of the ones I’ve played have been really enjoyable. They make me feel smart, even if I’m just painting by numbers.\n\n\nI also like seeing a game advertise its short length. Often, we get too caught up on time spent per dollar, but I don’t want to live in a world where every game is 60 hours. Some of them? Yes. But not all. I’d like to pick one up for afternoon entertainment. Such as Dangeresque The Roomisode Triungulate, which is also roughly 90 minutes. It’s great! There's no reason for me to not play this game. Even if I don't enjoy it, what have I lost? I spend more time a day killing my brain with Social Media.\n\n\nDuck Detective: The Secret Salami is set to arrive on PC sometime in 2024.\n\nThe post Duck Detective: The Secret Salami has you catching the office lunch thief appeared first on Destructoid.",

This one trades in a collapsing society for one full of fruitful farming fun, and developer Pixpil and publisher Chucklefish have it lined up for a January 31, 2024 launch. \n\n\nTo shake the tribulation of Eastward, Pixpil set Octopia in a parallel world that is, to say the least, a lot more chill. This time around Sam and John get to bask in that sweet farming life in the countryside as they build up an old farmstead, grow crops, cook with neighbors, and attract more eager new folks to the town of Octopia. \n\n\nYou can settle in yourself with the release date trailer:\n\n\n\n\nThe meticulous pixel art for which Eastward is known is one bond that this world and the other have in common. While Octopia is being released as DLC for Eastward, you don't have to complete the game to gain access. As long as you have a copy of Eastward you'll be able to venture to Octopia right from the main menu. Sam and John's peaceful new life will be available on Nintendo Switch and Steam for $5.99.\n\n\nEastward first launched in September 2021, delivering a journey adorned with gorgeous art and a soundtrack we won't soon forget. There's plenty of competition out there for farming sim games with nostalgic vibes, so we'll see how this one fits in early next year.\n\nThe post Eastward DLC expansion Octopia starts simple farming life on January 31, 2024 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Koei Tecmo revealed a date for the third piece of DLC, titled Upheaval in Jingxiang, which touches down on December 12, 2023.\n\n\nIf you're looking for new challenges, there should be plenty to go around in Jingxiang. Chief among the additions is a new story chapter that finds Liu Bei's forces fighting back against the chaos the Elixir has caused. As it continues to wreak havoc throughout the land following the death of Yu Ji, you'll be tasked with traveling to the Jing Province to put an end to its grim effects. \n\n\nGet a taste of the story in the DLC 3 trailer:\n\n\n\n\nUpheaval in Jingxiang also adds new enemies and demons, a new Divine Beast, and new generals that include Guan Ping and Lady M, among others. That's on top of the new equipment and a new system — that's all the official site says on the latter — and higher difficulty levels for those who didn't find Wo Long tough enough already. Finally, there's a new weapon category in the Whip, which looks painful as all hell.\n\n\nScreenshot via Koei Tecmo\n\n\nWo Long: Fallen Dynasty is currently available for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

Recently, the company announced 180 employees were being laid off, and now it's having to cease operations in Korea.\n\n\nIn a recent blog post, Twitch CEO Dan Clancy has said the service will shut down business in Korea, effective February 27, 2024. The statement goes on to say that it was a \"difficult decision\" but the \"the cost to operate\" Twitch in the country is \"prohibitively expensive.\"\n\n\nImage via Twitch.\n\n\nClancy explains that the company had spent time trying to reduce the cost of running in Korea, saying that the team \"experimented with a peer-to-peer model for source quality.\" All efforts appear to be in vain, though, with the platform saying it's been \"operating at a loss.\"\n\n\nWhat happens to Korean streamers?\n\n\nObviously, this means that anyone in Korea who uses Twitch to broadcast won't be able to come the end of February.

While the vast majority of them are free to download and install, Bethesda is once again interested in keeping some of the higher quality ones back for profit.\n\n\nA recent update for Skyrim was sent out and with it, Bethesda announced Creations, a new way for \"players to discover, download and play community-made content.\" In a nutshell, it means modders specially picked by the developer can earn a bit of money for their mods. That's right, you'll have to pay for these if you want to play them.\n\n\n\n\nAn FAQ explains those that have been vetted – referred to as \"Verified Creators\" – can set a price for mods \"from a set selection of options.\" They will then receive royalties from their content. While anyone can apply to be entered into the \"Verified Creator Program,\" it seems it's reserved mainly for those with experience and expertise, possibly bordering on professional levels.\n\n\nBecause it was so popular last time...\n\n\nAs you can imagine, it isn't going down well with the Skyrim community at all. Recent reviews on Steam show many are angry about this new \"evolution,\" as Bethesda is calling it. Not only does it reintroduce paid community content, but some have said the update has broken some mods.\n\n\nSomething similar was attempted back in 2015, when Bethesda teamed up with Valve to implement a way of getting players to pay for custom mods. That didn't go down well then, either, so it's interesting that it's being tried again.\n\n\nWhether this is something that's being attempted to see if it'll work with Starfield is just speculation on my part. It should be noted that modders can choose to upload content to Skyrim for free. But in any case, the Elder Scrolls and Fallout studio is once again making itself unpopular among the community.\n\nThe post Skyrim brings back paid mods, and it’s going down as well as you’d expect appeared first on Destructoid.",

It’s set to release on PC in 2024, but has a demo available today.\n\n\nThe Mermaid’s Tongue is once again a murder mystery that brings back the duo of Grimoire and Sally. It will once again be a mix of point-and-click adventure, visual novel, and puzzle game. This time, the victim is the “captain of the world’s strangest submarine.” I’m going to directly quote the press release on why it’s so strange: “Some say the captain was an immortal time-traveler. Others say he was a vampire, cursed to stay hidden beneath the waves forever.” Yeah, me too.\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s been shown off so far is what you’d expect from a Tangle Tower sequel. Wonderfully animated characters and fabulous backgrounds. I could watch that animation all day.\n\n\nI played the demo, which does a great job of setting up the mystery and getting you hooked in before it stops abruptly. When it ended, I audibly said, “You dick!” I mean, I didn’t expect a demo to contain the whole game. It was inevitably going to end mid-mystery, but it feels like an episode of Columbo showed the murder and cut out before the investigation. That's a me problem. I probably shouldn’t have played the demo, I guess.\n\n\nThe Mermaid’s Tongue has a planned release in 2024 on PC.

As a result, Jumplight Odyssey, a game that’s currently in Early Access, is being placed on indefinite pause.\n\n\nAs for the reason for these layoffs, League of Geeks co-founder Trent Kusters states: \n\n\n\n“Though our commitment to our beloved starship adventure sim is unwavering, rapidly rising operation costs, a worsening AUD/USD exchange rate, poor Early Access sales, and the unprecedented withdrawal of funding opportunities across the industry, have placed us in a position where, as it currently stands, we are unable to sustain the cost of operations through to the release of v1.0, which was planned for Q2 of 2024…",

          "description": "As part of the Wholesome Snack Showcase, Armor Games Studios and Bluecurse Studios announced that Snacko, the cat-fronted farming game, is set to enter Early Access… now. Right now! Go look!\n\n\nSnacko is a farming sim much like Stardew Valley (and Harvest Moon before it). You grow crops, raise livestock, and help a town learn to love again. Also, you have to push back miasma born from a curse that has overtaken the town of Snacko. All the while being a cat.\n\n\n\n\nI’m going to be honest with you: I actually knew this drop was going to happen ahead of time. I was only pretending to be surprised. I’m sorry for the betrayal. I also got to play it early and can tell you’re in for a cute time.\n\n\nAside from the visuals, one of Snacko’s big draws is the fact that you can seemingly build and customize anything. I think that includes the town, but I tried picking up somebody’s house, and it wouldn’t let me. It might just not let me do anything in town yet. I only really played enough to clear the tutorial.\n\n\nIt feels good so far, and its bright visuals with 2D characters look like a mix of a DS game and Mega Man Legends. The two-member developer states that they hope to have Snacko in Early Access for a year. In its current state, most of the game’s core systems are in place, and you can play the story from start to finish. From the sounds of things, Early Access is mostly going to be about getting feedback to help fix and polish its various elements.\n\n\nSnacko is available on PC via Steam Early Access. It will also be coming to Switch, PS4, and PS5 in 2024.\n\nThe post Feline farming sim Snacko gets shadow dropped into Early Access appeared first on Destructoid.",

It’s the perfect game to bring home and play with family during the holidays.\n\n\nIt’s a party game mixed with a dating sim, and the dating sim part is taken very seriously.

          "description": "With thousands already waiting for the trailer to drop, the GTA 6 teaser has been one of the most anticipated promos of this year, maybe of this whole generation. While it was unveiled a little earlier than planned, this has only made it possible for even more people to watch it many, many times.\n\n\nAt the time of writing, over 70 million people have seen the GTA 6 trailer over on YouTube. By comparison, \"Baby Shark\" has amassed around 13 billion views at the time of this writing, so GTA still has some way to go, but we're only on day one so far. Oh, also, the Grand Theft Auto 5 trailer has been viewed 98 million times, so it sounds like the new one could easily surpass it.\n\n\nThis number of people watching the trailer is going up at a pretty alarming rate, which is not entirely unsurprising. By now, many of you will have seen it, so you'll have your own thoughts on the upcoming new entry in the Grand Theft Auto series.\n\n\n\n\nSadly, we don't have a release date. All we know is that it's coming in 2025. That still feels like a long way off, especially for a game that people have been waiting about a decade for.\n\n\nAlso, no PC release confirmed yet\n\n\nParent company Take-Two Interactive also confirmed that GTA 6 will be coming to PS5 and Xbox Series. Nothing's been said about a PC version. If we're going off what happened with Grand Theft Auto 5, PC players might not get it for another year or so after the console release.\n\n\nThe teaser itself wasn't actually supposed to release when it did. Due to leaks on social media, Rockstar decided to show the trailer early.\n\n\nGTA 6 has already been the subject of hacks and leaks, so the fact that someone was able to get the trailer up before the official release time is not that surprising. Still, it doesn't seem to have harmed the Rockstar YouTube figures much. It could very well go down as the most watched video game trailer in history.\n\nThe post The GTA 6 trailer is already racking up a ridiculously high view count appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Despite version 2.0 supposedly being the last big update for Cyberpunk 2077, CD Projekt Red is bringing us one last hurrah. As well as implementing a number of fixes, the latest patch brings with it fresh ideas to see things out before the studio moves onto new games.\n\n\nTo go with the Ultimate Edition that's also been released, update 2.1 has added a few changes today. You can check out the video below for an overview. Some of the things now in Cyberpunk 2077 include a metro system, hangouts with partners, new vehicles, better vehicle combat, improved boss fights, and more.\n\n\n\n\nYou can also read the full patch notes to see what else has been done in this latest version. As you can see, it's no small feat, encompassing a veritable laundry list of tweaks, fixes, and changes. The update should be rolling out as we speak.\n\n\nIs this it for Cyberpunk now?\n\n\nCDPR recently said it's ramped up the team size for the new Witcher saga. On top of that, Community Director for the studio, Marcin Momot, has said that 2.1 represents \"one more patch\" for the game. After this, the team will be focusing on future projects, of which there are quite a few.\n\n\n\n\nThat's not to say Cyberpunk will be abandoned entirely. At least not for the immediate future. The game is about to turn three-years old, and CD Projekt Red will probably want to keep things ticking over for a bit longer. However, the developer is now thinking about what's coming next, which includes working on a sequel to Cyberpunk.\n\n\nFor now, we at least get one last crack at some new changes in Night City. Make your next playthrough count, as it's almost certainly the last major update the game will be getting. For real this time.\n\nThe post Cyberpunk 2077 version 2.1 is the last big update, for reals appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Ever the versatile games, the first two Doom entries are staples of the dedicated mod community. With the original being crossed over with Doctor Who, it seems mixing franchises is not off the table for the plucky FPS. That also includes other titles from id Software.\n\n\nComing from ModDB user DASniperIC, their recent Doom 2 mod is a recreation of 1992's Wolfenstein 3D. Using the former's engine, they've been able to do a faithful reconstruction of the latter. While it doesn't look much different given that they're both retro shooters from a bygone era, you can tell it's Doom because of the UI at the bottom.\n\n\nImage via DASniperIC/ModDB.\n\n\nIt doesn't appear as though this is a full remake of Wolfenstein, though. In the description, DASniperIC says the following:\n\n\n\nThe maps [sic] layout is basically exactly the same as in Wolfenstein 3D, there is a working chaingun and treasure, 3 bosses and some DEHACKED sillies to better mirror Wolf3D. And a surprise for MAP33 :)\n\n\n\n\nGuten Tag, Doomguy\n\n\nGiven that it says there are three bosses, it's likely that this isn't a full recreation of Wolfenstein 3D. The original game has six bosses, so it's possible that this mod represents maybe half the game. The mention of something special on level 33 also suggests this. I haven't had a chance to play it yet, so I can't confirm that.\n\n\nIt never gets tiring seeing all the interesting modifications that are coming out for these absolute classic FPS games. While there could be a Wolfenstein 3 currently in development, there are evidently more than enough people keeping the old-school games alive and well, decades after their original release dates.\n\nThe post Modder remakes Wolfenstein 3D in Doom 2’s engine appeared first on Destructoid.",

That silence has finally been broken with the news that the Nintendo port is arriving sometime next year.\nThe Switch version comes in the form of Kingdom Come: Deliverance - Royal Edition. The port is being handled by Saber Interactive (Warhorse Studios is the original developer) and bundles the base game with all released DLC. It will be available both digitally and physically. There's no new trailer showcasing how the game runs on Switch, but Saber did release a few screenshots of the port. \n\nKingdom Come: Deliverance first arrived in February 2018 and stars Henry, the son of a blacksmith who embarks on a quest to fight against invaders to avenge the death of his parents and the destruction of his village. The game is best known for its demanding, realistic gameplay, which has earned it a cult following of dedicated fans while polarizing others. \nYou can read our original review of Kingdom Come: Deliverance here.",

The second expansion, The Indigo Disk, hits Pokémon Scarlet and Violet next week, on December 14, and to celebrate its arrival, Game Freak and Nintendo released a four-minute trailer today showcasing some of the DLC's highlights. \nIn it, we see plenty of starter Pokémon – every starter is returning in The Indigo Disk – and various legendaries, too, like the Johto dogs, the Hoenn legendaries, and much more. We also get a taste of Blueberry Academy, its special Blueberry Quests, unique Pokémon-centric minigames, and a dose of tough double battles against various trainers at the school. \nCheck out the Pokémon Scarlet and Violet Indigo Disk DLC trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nElsewhere in the trailer, we also learn of some special upcoming events players can participate in.

          "description": "Open Roads, the narrative adventure game starring Keri Russell (The Americans, Star Wars Episode IX: Rise of Skywalker) and Kaitlyn Dever (Booksmart, Uncharted 4: A Thief's End), finally has a release date, nearly three years after its initial reveal at The Game Awards 2020. It hits consoles and PC on February 22, 2024. \nPublisher Annapurna Interactive announced this release date today with a new trailer that features Russell talking about the game. Check out the Open Roads release date trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nA likely reason Open Roads took three years to reveal a release date after its 2020 debut is because its original creative lead, Steve Gaynor, co-founder of Fullbright and director of Gone Home, was accused of cultivating a hostile work environment in 2021, as reported by Polygon. Shortly after the allegations arose, Gaynor stepped back from his role as creative lead and manager. Since then, Open Roads has detached itself from Fullbright, with the small team of developers behind the title going by Open Roads Team.  \nGame Informer spoke to the Open Roads Team in 2022 about these changes and how it was moving forward with the game's development – you can read our in-depth feature about it here. \n\"In Open Roads, Tess [Devers] and Opal [Russell] embark on a road trip adventure to explore a series of long-abandoned properties, unearthing the past,\" the game's description reads on Steam. \"They'll search the ruins of these places that hold buried memories, things Opal has tried for years to forget. And in this search, they'll discover not just the truth they've been seeking, but each other.\" \nOpen Roads hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on Febraury 22, 2024. \nAre you going to check out Open Roads next year?

          "description": "Alongside the launch of Fortnite Chapter 5: Season 1, Epic Games revealed Lego Fortnite, a new experience that takes the familiarity of Fortnite and mashes it together with Lego for a new survival adventure experience. Today, Epic Games and Lego released a cinematic trailer for Lego Fortnite that reveals crafting, combat, multiplayer team-ups, a massive world to explore, and more. \nThe trailer begins with a standard Fortnite character – Brite Bomber – running into a reality-shifting rift that transports her to a Lego-fied world. There are Lego sheep, castle-like structures, rolling hills and plains, and, unfortunately for this character, a storm. She runs into the castle to discover a crafting bench of sorts where she crafts an axe, and that's where her survival adventure begins.\nCheck out the Lego Fortnite cinematic trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, after crafting an axe, she creates a cabin for shelter, a pen for the Lego sheep, an entire garden, and a bonfire to cook some food. It's not long before banana character Peely (also Lego-fied) shows up, and after hearing the howls of some nearby wolves, the two craft some weapons. From here, the duo meets two others, and together, all four of them set off on a survival adventure that brings them over snowy mountains, into a desert, and eventually, into a cavernous mine where they run into deadly skeletons and a massive monster. \nThe trailer's cinematics end there, cutting to a Lego Fortnite title screen that reveals the new experience goes live in Fortnite tomorrow, December 7. \nLego Fortnite is just one of three new Fortnite experiences revealed alongside Chapter 5 of the Battle Royale mode. Also joining the Fortnite multiverse of experiences is Rocket Racing, a new racing mode, and Fortnite Festival, a new music-centric experience. \nAre you excited for Lego Fortnite?

          "description": "Mortal Kombat 1 launched back in September and became one of our favorite games of the year – read why in Game Informer's Mortal Kombat 1 review here. Since its release, developer NetherRealm Studios has released additional characters, like Invincible's Omni-Man, while teasing other new fighters like Quan Chi and DC's Peacemaker. Now, Mortal Kombat creator Ed Boon has teased even more new content on the way. \nDuring the recent CCXP23 event in Brazil, Boon revealed that story DLC is coming, as reported by IGN. \n\n\n\"Just like we did with [Mortal Kombat 11], we're going to release a second part with more story and we have a big surprise after that,\" Boon told the crowd at CCXP23. \nMentioning Mortal Kombat 11, it's likely that Boon was referring to its Aftermath DLC, which included an all-new story and more. After this story DLC release for Mortal Kombat 1, it sounds like players can expect even more in the form of a \"big surprise.\" Unfortunately, Boon stopped short of sharing more about this surprise. \nThis additional content speaks to the studio's philosophy around supporting Mortal Kombat 1 post-launch. Boon said during CCXP23 that, \"[We're] going to be supporting the game for even longer than we did with Mortal Kombat 11,\" adding that, \"It's going to be fun.\" \n\n\nIf the recent cadence of content is any indication, Mortal Kombat 1 fans are in for a treat over the next few years with NetherRealm's latest fighter. \nFor more, read Game Informer's Mortal Kombat 1 review and then check out Boon on the YouTube interview show, Hot Ones. \n[Source: IGN]\nWhat do you think this big surprise for Mortal Kombat 1 could be?

Movie, which garnered strong fan reactions and grossed more than $1 billion at the box office.\nWhile 2025 is the next major milestone for the collaboration, with Super Nintendo World locations opening in Singapore and Orlando, we got an announcement during a Universal Kick-Off media meeting. The big news pertaining to Super Nintendo World, as reported by Universal Parks News Today, is that the previously announced Donkey Kong Country expansion to Universal Studios Japan's park opens this coming spring. The expansion features a new rollercoaster starring the iconic ape, themed merchandise, more interactive experiences, and presumably themed decorations to make you feel like you've traveled to The Country.\nWhile there are currently no plans for the Donkey Kong Country expansion to come to Universal Studios Hollywood, but according to Orlando Park Stop, Epic Universe in Orlando will be getting a mine-cart-themed Donkey Kong rollercoaster. Super Nintendo World at Universal Studios' Epic Universe is currently slated to open in 2025, but prior to that, it sounds as though the Osaka location will debut the DK attractions.",

          "description": "Developer Rockstar Games announced last week that it was going to release the first trailer for Grand Theft Auto VI on Tuesday, December 5. However, the studio released the trailer a day earlier – watch the official GTA VI reveal trailer here – after it leaked online. The trailer confirmed GTA VI will be released in 2025 and now, thanks to a new press release from Rockstar parent company, Take-Two Interactive Software, we know it's coming to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. \nCuriously, the press release only mentions those two platforms, leaving out PC. Here's what it says: \nDespite the popularity of Grand Theft Auto V on PC, it seems like GTA VI won't be launching on PC on day one. Of course, this doesn't mean the game won't eventually make its way to PC; GTA V eventually got there (albeit about a year and a half later). And Red Dead Redemption II didn't launch on PC either. \nGame Informer has reached out to Rockstar Games to ask if a PC version of GTA VI is planned and, if there is one, when it will be released, and will update this story if more is learned. \nIn the meantime, read about the first official Grand Theft Auto VI trailer here, and then check out some screenshots from the trailer below: \n\nHow do you feel about Grand Theft Auto VI skipping PC at launch?

          "description": "Dragon Age: Dreadwolf has been a long time coming, and a new teaser trailer – arriving on Dragon Age Day, appropriately – provides a glimpse of its continent, Thedas, while also announcing when Bioware will properly reveal the game. \nThe trailer provides a cinematic flyby of Thedas’ map and a few scenic shots of locales as out-of-context musings from several characters set the tone. It wraps up with a message announcing a full reveal coming next summer. \n\n\nIt’s a bittersweet announcement. It’s good to know when we’ll finally see what Dreadwolf actually is. We're just bummed to get a teaser for a trailer that's months away. There’s always the chance Dreadwolf launches a few months after its grand debut (it’s happened before with several other big games), though the game was announced as being in the middle of full production last year, and with Bioware’s recent restructuring resulting in layoffs, a 2024 launch may be optimistic. \nAlthough Dragon Age: Dreadwolf has been in development in some form since at least 2015, its first big teaser took place at The Game Awards in 2018. However, it didn’t get its proper title until last year. Dreadwolf has gone through the wringer in terms of development shake-ups, from high-profile departures at Bioware, including Casey Hudson (again), to EA reworking it from a live-service model to a more single-player-focused experience following Anthem’s failure. \nWe still know very little about what Dreadwolf entails other than it takes place in Tevinter and will feature Solas (the titular Dread Wolf) and new characters Bellara and Davrin, whom we know nothing about as of yet. Here's hoping Bioware rolls out the carpet for the game in a big way next year after fans have waited so long to see what's next in the Dragon Age mythos.",

In a press release, Starbreeze states that Baxter is being developed in Unreal Engine 5 and “will carry the signature Starbreeze game cornerstones of co-operative multiplayer, lifetime commitment through a Games as a Service-Model, community engagement and a larger than life experience.” Although D&D is a role-playing game, it's unclear what genre Project Baxter will be. \nWe are excited to unveil Dungeons & Dragons® as the IP for our next game, codename ”Project Baxter”.

During a stream detailing the update with developers Paweł Sasko and Monika Janowska, the team at CD Projekt revealed Cyberpunk will be getting a 2.1 update soon that will add a fully functional metro, radioport, replayable car races, boss fight improvements, accessibility features, and more. The update will be available December 5 (the same day Rockstar is launching the trailer for the next Grand Theft Auto), which will also mark the release of Cyberpunk 2077's Ultimate Edition.\nThe metro system, called NCART in the game, lets players move around the city and take in the views. The Radioport will let players listen to music outside of vehicles. The update will also allow players to to invite their in-game significant others to \"quality time\" together in V's apartment. The other previously mentioned updates are a little more self-explanatory, though CD Projekt did specifically mention that the boss updates were specifically applied to the late-game encounter with Adam Smasher. He is also now equipped with Sandevistan, which was seen in Cyberpunk: Edgerunners. New vehicles will be added like the Porsche 911 Cabriolet and others, motorcycle handling has been improved, and there are also technical updates like larger fonts and the option to turn off timers in the Breach Protocol minigame.\nAs stated, the 2.1 patch launches December 5 on all platforms.

The trailer for the next be Grand Theft Auto will premiere Tuesday December 5 at 9 a.m. ET.\npic.twitter.com/BguwiJokQt\nDecember 1, 2023\nRockstar shared the tweet above without any context, so it's worth noting that it is technically not confirming that this trailer will be for the next Grand Theft Auto. All it says is \"Trailer 1\" and a date. But, considering its early November tease explicitly read, \"We are very excited to let you know that in early December, we will release the first trailer for the next Grand Theft Auto,\" it's safe to assume that this is what the tweet is referencing.\nThe art of the tweet also offers the first official tease for the game's tropical setting. It has long been rumored that the next Grand Theft Auto would return to Vice City and a massive leak in September where 90 video related to the game also made that apparent.\n\n\nIf you're on a video game website reading about Grand Theft Auto, it's safe to assume that the excitement surrounding this game does not need to contextualized, but the previous Grand Theft Auto is one of the video game industry's biggest hits of all time. In 2018 it was crowned the most profitable entertainment product of all time.\n\n\nWhile waiting to learn more about Rockstar's next game, read Game Informer's Grand Theft Auto V review and then read our thoughts on Red Dead Redemption II.

In my review, I wrote that the game’s “ingenious climbing system, beautiful art direction, and intriguing world-building, inching toward the top is worth the effort.” That effort can be attributed to Don’t Nod honing in on the game’s central mechanic, climbing, and building a fascinating world and lore around it. I spoke to the game’s lead designer, Sofiane Saheb, and art director, Edouard Caplain, to better understand how Don’t Nod spent over three years bringing Jusant to life. \nCaplain states Jusant’s development began after Don’t Nod finished work on Life is Strange 2.

While we still don’t know his exact role or who will voice him, today’s image, posted above, provides a good look at Shadow below the neck (does he have a neck?), namely his signature air shoes. \nOff and RUNNING. #SonicMovie3\npic.twitter.com/BUIlurNIC0\nNovember 29, 2023\nProduction on Sonic the Hedgehog 3 had stalled due to the SAG-AFTRA strikes, and today’s update confirms work has resumed following the strike's suspension. Jeff Fowler remains in the director’s chair, and the returning cast includes Ben Schwartz (Sonic), Colleen O'Shaughnessey (Tails), Idris Elba (Knuckles), and James Marsden (Tom Wachowski).\nWhatever the third film entails, it has one heck of an act to follow. Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was a box office smash, becoming the highest-grossing video game film of all time in the U.S. until The Super Mario Bros. Movie took that crown earlier this year. A live-action TV spin-off starring Knuckles is also in the works and slated to release early next year.",

The news was accidentally posted early to the Xbox store and was even briefly available to play (albeit in unfinished form) on Ubisoft Plus. \nAccording to its now-deleted Xbox Store page (which was shared by Wario64 on X), the 2003 adventure will now feature 4K graphics and 60 FPS with improvements to controls and audio. It will also feature auto-save and cross-save functionality. Here’s the full blurb:\nThe store page also included a big batch of screenshots of the remaster, which can view in the gallery below.\n\nAccording to Ubisoft’s statement to IGN. , the store listing went up early due to a “technical error” \n\"As we celebrate the 20th anniversary of Beyond Good & Evil, we're excited to share that the official launch is set for early 2024, and we look forward to sharing more with you in the new year,\" Ubisoft wrote in the statement. \nBeyond Good & Evil originally launched for PlayStation 2, Xbox, PC, and GameCube in 2003. It stars Jade, a reporter and fighter who joins a resistance movement to uncover a conspiracy on an alien planet. Gameplay involves taking on enemies in martial arts melee combat while using Jade's camera to take photos of clues and evidence while solving puzzles. The cult classic received its first big remaster in 2011 in the form of an HD upgrade, while its long-lost sequel, Beyond Good and Evil 2, has seemingly been in development limbo since its formal reveal at E3 2017. \nBeyond Good & Evil - 20th Anniversary Edition is expected to launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.",

Their latest collaborative effort introduces skins from a list of popular indie games; Undertale, Celeste, A Hat in Time, Crypt of the Necrodancer, Untitled Goose Game, Alien Hominid Invasion, and Castle Crashers. The cosmetics from all seven games will be included in a Cosmicube, which can be purchased with 7000 beans. The crossover includes 25 hats, 18 skins, 12 nameplates, 9 visors, and 6 pets. You can see a gallery of the featured skins below.\n\nThe update will also include a series of patches (which you can read right here) and will notably deprecate 2021 versions of the game, pushing players to use updated versions instead. \"We’ve been supporting a lot of older versions of the game, and as it continues to grow and get new features, it gets harder to keep up,\" the patch notes read. \"We have to remove older versions so we can focus on improving our system for everyone. Make sure you update your game and thanks for understanding!\"\nThis is the first update to Among Us since they added The Fungle, a new map that takes place in a fungus-infested jungle.

With no prior announcement or fanfare, people booting up Batman: Arkham Knight were greeted with a skin from 2022's The Batman starring Robert Pattinson. But then, as quickly as it appeared, it was removed, all without comment from the developers. While we still don't know exactly why the skin was added accidentally, we know exactly why it was created: it's a timed-exclusive suit launching with the Batman: Arkham Trilogy on Switch.\n\n\nThe collection brings Rocksteady's beloved trio of Batman games to Nintendo's hybrid console, complete with all previously released DLC. The trilogy will also include the aforementioned suit from The Batman, but it won't be limited to the Switch forever – other platforms will get access to the suit \"at a later date.\"\nGame Informer, much like the rest of the gaming community, is a big fan of the trilogy, with all three games appearing on our list of best superhero games of all time. While it's been eight years since the last game, Rocksteady has been hard at work ever since working on Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, which is set to come out on February 2, 2024.

It’s already the highest-grossing horror film of 2023, and it has now become horror production company Blumhouse’s highest-grossing film of all time.\nThe film adaptation of the popular 2014 horror game hit theaters on October 27, grossing a strong $80 million in its opening weekend, the best for any horror film this year. That’s even more impressive given that it premiered on the streaming service Peacock the same day it was released in theaters (becoming the most-watched title on Peacock during its first five days). \nFive Nights At Freddy’s has continued to gain traction over the past few weeks and has now grossed over $295 million ($136 million domestically, $160 million overseas) during the month it's been in theaters. That ranks it at the top of Blumhouse’s highest-performing films, a record previously held by M.Night Shyamalan’s Split, while also climbing over top performers such as Halloween (2018), Get Out, and Glass. \nFNAF is the BIGGEST @blumhouse film of ALL-TIME.

The film is directed by Emma Tammi and produced by Blumhouse. The film joins the ranks of other highly successful video game adaptations to release in 2023, such as the other box office juggernaut The Super Mario Bros.

          "description": "Bloober Team has unexpectedly provided a light update on its upcoming remake of Silent Hill 2, ensuring fans that its development is “progressing smoothly”. You'll just have to wait for Konami to share more details. \nIn an X post, the team behind The Medium and Layers of Fear asks for fans’ patience in regard to new information on the game while stating that development is going according to schedule. Konami announced the Silent Hill 2 remake last October with a lengthy trailer showcasing the 2001 classic’s updated presentation. The game currently has no release window but will launch on PlayStation 5 and PC. \n\n\nHere is Bloober Team’s full update: \nSilent Hil 2 remake was one of many new Silent Hill projects announced last October. The first one to arrive was Silent Hill Ascension, an interactive streaming series that premiered on Halloween. Other projects in the pipeline include Silent Hill f, a new mainline entry set in 1960s Japan, and Silent Hill Townfall, a mysterious title published by Annapurna Interactive and developed by No Code, the creators of Observation. A new live-action film called Return to Silent Hill is also in production by original Silent Hill director Christophe Gans.",

Free-to-play games are not universally bad; plenty of brilliant design ideas, engaging stories, and fun mechanics can be found in games with no upfront admission fee. But once a game’s goal shifts from singular experience to long-term engagement, any excitement I may have folds in on itself and disappears like Pac-Man.\nIt all stems from my desire for experiences, not obligations.\nIn free-to-play and comparable models, success is marked by player engagement. The more rounds a player queues into and the longer they play, the more likely they are to engage with the monetized elements. And the best way to encourage that engagement is to incentivize players to return. Dai…",

By using our affiliate links to buy your favorite games, you granted us a small commission from GOG.com – without having to spend more than the original price.\nEarlier this year, GOG.com announced the discontinuation of its old affiliate program. Instead of using a simple referral link, they are now using two external affiliation networks that contain cross-site tracking, as considered by many ad blockers. Since we have been affiliated with GOG.com since 2009, we were able to use the legacy referral links for a couple of months after they initially discontinued them.\nUnfortunately, our affiliate links were put to rest effective November 22nd, 2023.\nSince we don't feel comfortable that you would have to use external affiliation networks just to support the project, and because tracking users is against our project policies, we decided not to join the new program.\nWe still value GOG.com as an excellent source for legally purchasing games supported by ScummVM. Even though we are not affiliated with them anymore, we'll continue to support their releases, e.g. by adding and updating the game data files' signatures for the ScummVM supported games that are available for purchase from GOG.com in our detection database and providing links to their releases in our list of available games.\nThank you GOG.com and everybody who used our affiliate link for your support over the last 14 years!\n>",

However, a series of strange accidents, plus some murmurings of a ghost haunting, quickly threaten to turn this renovation into an investigation.\nIn Nancy Drew: Treasure in the Royal Tower a failed ski vacation at an eccentric castle with even more eccentric inhabitants soon turns into a quest to uncover a lost piece of the history of the French Revolution.\nAnd if you’re looking for something more thrilling, in Nancy Drew: The Final Scene, you will find yourself racing against the clock to find your kidnapped friend, while also saving a historical theater with more than a fair share of secrets from demolition.\nThe games are available for purchase through HeR Interactive’s website or Steam (Stay Tuned for Danger is not available on Steam, however). Or if you already own a CD copy of the games, their English and Russian variants will also work. To play them with ScummVM, you will need a daily development build.
