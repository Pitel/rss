          "description": "Discounted delights.\nBefore the June Direct came along, we were starting to think that 2024 would be the year of remakes and remasters on Switch. We had Another Code: Recollection, Mario vs. Donkey Kong, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door and Luigi's Mansion 2 HD already banked and that was before Donkey Kong Country Returns HD (releasing in 2025) was added to the pile. Sure, new titles like Echoes of Wisdom and Mario & Luigi: Brothership left things looking a little brighter, but, like it or not, as the Switch keeps chugging through its eighth year, Nintendo is clearly relying on the old faithful to tide us over until new hardware.\nIt's no surprise, of course. Game development is no walk in the park, and despite the Switch's undoubtedly impressive library, there are still a handful of classics that are yet to make the jump to the hybrid console *cough Wind Waker cough*. It's the way that most Nintendo consoles go in their senior years, but these late-life lineups have historically been counterbalanced by a 'Nintendo Selects' range, a chance for owners to catch up on some of the console's bestsellers at a reduced price.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Today, publisher Top Hat Studios has revealed that the game will be launching on Nintendo Switch, alongside other platforms, on 27th August 2024 for $19.99.\nThompson's previous two games — Sheepo and Islets — both proved to be excellent takes on the Metroidvania genre, and Crypt Custodian looks to build upon that knowledge. From the premise alone, you can already tell the game is quirky, cute, and heartwarming; you're playing as a deceased cat (called Pluto) who is sentenced to being the afterworld's janitor. But after befriending some ghosts, Pluto discovers that there may be a treasure hidden in the afterlife that will allow him to speak with the living.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "A winner is you.\nBack in the days of the Nintendo 3DS eShop, some of you may remember the Denpa Men trilogy, which offered a series of cheap and approachable RPG adventures that felt like a great fit for the portable. However, there was a fourth title released only in Japan in 2014 which experimented with a free-to-play structure that proved reasonably popular. That game died with the ending of online services for the 3DS, so Genius Sonority has seen fit to retool it for the Switch era and release it worldwide as The New Denpa Men. It may not be one of the best free-to-play games available on Switch, but New Denpa Men still proves to be modestly enjoyable.\nThe narrative in New Denpa Men is hardly in line with the epic and occasionally drawn-out stuff that JRPGs are known for. Here, you command an army of Denpa Men—charmingly weird little dudes that look like a cross between a Mii and a Teletubby—to go on various quests geared towards helping various cutesy yellow creatures with long noses. The episodic structure works well with the bite-sized gameplay design, though it must be said that the localization here is NES-era levels of atrocious. Yet funnily enough, the broken English honestly adds to New Denpa Men’s quirky charm, as it feels strangely in line with the awkward vibe of the characters and world.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It's being developed by Rotoscope Studios and it's a low-poly, 90s-inspired mix of dystopian RPG, survival, third and first-person shooter, with some roguelike bits slapped in there, as well. Whew, that's a lot. Potentially too much. But hey, I am here for something ambitious and interesting, of which it ticks both boxes.\nRead more",

A Roomba capable of tunnelling through miles of procedurally generated, monster-infested crust so as to reorganise the Earth's core and bring about its ultimate objective - a sparkling living room. I enjoy the militant reductiveness of this character motivation. There are sprawling underground ecosystems to discover, yes, weird plants to harvest, fractious clumps of tentacles to appraise, avoid or slaughter. But all of these things are contemptible details to be swept up and bagged and thrown in the dumpster.\n Read more",

It's a juicy read for armchair designers and lapsed Overwatchers like myself, packing in analysis of class roles and the shift from the free choice of heroes to single hero picks and enforced team compositions.\nIn broad strokes, Keller summarises how the Overwatch experience has drifted away from \"player freedom and creativity in order to create a more balanced, consistent and competitive experience for players\". It's possible, however, that Overwatch 2 will swing back in the other direction, as Blizzard are now \"exploring how we can test different forms of 6v6 in the game to gauge the results\", with a view to restoring some of the joyful chaos that saw entire teams of Reinhardts charging the objective in formation.\n Read more",

Beware slight spoilers for Alan Wake 2 in the passages ahead.\n\r\nDeep in the Dark Place of Alan Wake 2 there is a forest that is not a forest - a zig-zag tunnel adorned with murals of a grisly woodland scene. Entering that tunnel, you find yourself sealed in at either end. But the mural suggests a way out: it changes when you turn around, following an unspoken narrative. It's a device as delicate as the graffiti elsewhere in the Dark Place is obnoxious. In hindsight, it feels like an example of \"metsänpeitto\", a concept from Finnish folklore about forests which, as writer Sinikka Annala explains, saturates the design of Alan Wake 2. It's a fascinating idea I'd love certain much larger, less intriguing video game worlds to learn from.\r\n\n \nRead more",

He shouldn't have insisted his lover subsequently pay him for a confession to absolve herself of the guilt accrued from sleeping with him. He shouldn't have felt safe in a room next to the Queen, a woman described as \"reckless\" in her character traits, and who is perilously close to having a nervous breakdown. This, my holy friend, is how your bed chamber becomes a raging inferno. \nBy the end of my first game of Norland, the village of Nandos (you can name your own settlements) is covered in more blood than the back end of the bard's best work.

          "description": "Many moons ago, I remember having a chat with Brendy about FPS Metro Exodus’s choice to have characters frequently speak over each other in conversation. It’s something I always appreciate in films (Brendy mentioned Fleabag, I brought up Shane Meadows), and although the flow of many of Exodus’ scenes were quite awkward, it was still refreshing to see a game break away from the common, unnatural back-and-forth line delivery. Bioshock and Judas’s Ken Levine has a name for this - “turn-based dialogue.” According to Levine, it’s “one of the biggest problems” in the way games portray conversations.\nRead more",

I'm a needy soul, someone who demands immediacy and a special emotional sauce.\nUntil Then is, without a doubt, the only visual novel-y game I've truly enjoyed. In fact, I'd say I've more than enjoyed it - I think it's superb so far.

Rather than just being routes around to the other side of a barred door - though there are plenty such Lordrannish loops to find in this game - they consist of aerial chains of magic, purple triangles that suck you toward them when you hold a button. They lend vigour to a branching, faux-Napoleonic world that might otherwise be a collection of atmospheric strolls between bonfire-equivalents and fights defined by taut resourcing systems. They're idiot-proof grappling points from which you can launch yourself at another triangle, a ledgeful of upgrade materials, or a loitering musketeer who is in urgent need of a ground-pound. \r\n \nRead more",

With the last minute delay of the Ryzen 900 series by 1~2 weeks, the embargo lift for the Ryzen AI 300 series is timed for this Sunday morning where I can now present the first AMD Zen 5 Linux benchmark results. And with being the first Zen 5 chip in my lab, I have been pushing it hard... Here is an extensive look at the ASUS Zenbook S 16 I received with the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 current flagship SoC compared to a variety of other AMD and Intel laptop models. The focus was on both the raw performance and the package performance-per-Watt for the overall power efficiency of this Zen 5 SoC. And with it being the first Zen 5 hardware in the lab, I didn't limit the selection to just conventional laptop workloads but also explored the performance characteristics for various other workloads of interest to diverse Linux users and for an idea of the HX 370 potential or similar Zen 5 chips appearing in thin client / edge / IoT type devices. This initial taste of AMD Zen 5 has me extremely excited about the performance potential of the upcoming Ryzen 9000 series and EPYC Turin processors.",

          "description": "Some believe that when you die, that's it. Lights out. Others believe there's an afterlife, and sometimes that afterlife needs a cloaked cat to keep it clean. The latter theory holds water in Crypt Custodian, a top-down Metroidvania that hits PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC on August 27. \n\n\nYou can see a sample of its broom-bashing gameplay in a new release date trailer:\n\n\n\n\nWhen a mischievous cat named Pluto dies, their subsequent meeting with the Afterlife Guardian doesn't go so well. Rather than being treated to a relaxing afterlife, Pluto is sentenced to be the janitor of the afterworld for the rest of eternity. Thankfully, it seems as if Pluto might be up to the task, thanks to the power of beating up monsters with a broom. \n\n\nIt also looks like there are some other weapons and upgrades to help Pluto along the way, like the Broomerang Dash ability showcased in the trailer. It's one of those fun traversal powers that lets you toss something and then dash to its position. You can mix and match upgrades throughout, and use new abilities to open up more of the world in classic Metroidvania fashion. \n\n\nIt's all held together with what appears to be a pretty lively style and some big bosses to contend with. Developer Kyle Thompson (Islets, Sheepo)—who makes Metroidvanias with his brother Eric handling the music—is bringing Crypt Custodian to life with publisher Top Hat Studios. Hopefully, their adventure is as simple and clean as it looks. \n\nThe post Crypt Custodian cleans up the afterlife with broom-bashing brawls in August appeared first on Destructoid.",

Fortunately, the wait isn't too long now that the countdown has begun. Find out when the Roblox The Games event will start.\n\n\nRoblox The Games event start date and time\n\n\nThe Roblox The Games event is set to commence on Aug. 1, 2024, at 10 a.m. PT/12 p.m. CT/1 p.m. EDT. While the end date is yet to be confirmed, creators have hinted at a conclusion on Aug. 11. This means you'll have a tight window of less than two weeks to conquer the event and claim your rewards.\n\n\nWhat will be included in the event remains a mystery; however, the countdown page has provided a few teasers. From the looks of it, five teams will be competing against each other in a series of games. It will function like the Metaverse Champions, in which everyone can choose a team and earn rewards from their quests.\n\n\nImage via Roblox Corporation\n\n\nNotable Roblox players will seemingly lead each group. YouTuber KreekCraft has been confirmed to be one of them, and it won't be long until the others are revealed. \n\n\nLike The Classic and The Hunt, you can play multiple games on the Roblox The Games event dedicated server. Some titles have already been confirmed for the celebration, including Bad Business, Dress to Impress, Funky Friday, and Driving Empire. We got a few sneak peeks into their collectible rewards, such as Dress to Impress' exclusive mermaid set and Funky Friday's Rhythm Challenger's Boombox.\n\n\nThere will undoubtedly be many more games and rewards to look forward to once more content rolls out. Badges will also be available for the completionists out there. Plus, a Roblox The Games cosmetic bundle will likely be a part of it, typically costing premium Robux. \n\nThe post When does Roblox The Games event start? appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions is now up for pre-order on all available platforms, and there are two different editions to choose from. \n\n\nThe upcoming Quidditch simulator is scheduled to go live very soon in September, and pre-ordering your copy can fetch you some bonus gifts as well. But it's important to get the correct edition as there's no way to upgrade/downgrade your purchase (without cancelation and re-ordering another copy). \n\n\nAll Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions Editions\n\n\nWhile buying a copy of the game, you can pick one of these two editions (priced differently). \n\n\nStandard Edition ($29.99)\n\n\n\nBase game\n\n\n\nDeluxe Edition ($39.99)\n\n\n\nBase game\n\n\nGryffindor House Pack\n\n\nSlytherin House Pack\n\n\nRavenclaw House Pack\n\n\nHufflepuff House Pack\n\n\n2000 Gold\n\n\n\n\n\nHarry Potter: Quidditch Champions Pre-Order bonus\n\n\nBoth the Standard and Deluxe Editions offer the same pre-order bonus - Firebolt Supreme Broom Skin. This pre-order bonus is available for all who purchase the game before September 3, 2024. \n\n\nIs the  Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions Deluxe Edition worth buying?\n\n\nUsually, the Deluxe edition of modern day video games tend to have a mark-up of $20-$30. In this case, it's $10, and in exchange, you get four house packs, and 2,000 Gold. At this point, there's no way to know what type of microtransactions will be there.\n\n\nIf you're a big Harry Potter fan (highly likely if you plan on purchasing a Quidditch game in the first place), I would consider picking up the Deluxe edition. The additional Gold could come in handy later when the game goes live. The Standard edition is a better pick for those who just want to try the game out as just another sports title. \n\nThe post All Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions Editions and Pre-Order bonuses appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Fans of the popular manga series Dandadan will have to wait a little longer for the next installment. Yukinobu Tatsu's hit action-horror-comedy manga has announced a month-long break following the release of Chapter 163, with Chapter 164 set to arrive on September 2.\n\n\nPer an unofficial Shonen Jump news account, Tatsu cites \"researching information\" as the reason behind the hiatus. It makes sense, given that the manga has recently concluded its Danmanra Arc with a big cliffhanger, which may finally cohesively tie the narrative together.\n\n\nFor the uninitiated, Dandadan is a manga series that can be aptly described as a perfect mishmash of scary, funny, and weird. Classmates Ken Takakura (\"Okarun\") and Momo Ayase disagree over whether aliens or spirits are real, so they visit the stomping grounds of each others' paranormal beliefs and discover that both of them were right.\n\n\nThe ensuing series winds through tales of folklore, space oddities, family, and more. It's a fun series that's danced around the upper echelon of rankings in apps like MangaPlus for a while now.\n\n\nAn anime adaptation of Dandadan was also announced last May, and is set to release in October this year. Science Saru is responsible for the adaptation, with Fuga Yamashiro as the director. It also has a star-studded cast including Shion Wakayama (Takina Inoue in Lycoris Recoil), Natsuki Hanae (Tanjiro Kamado in Demon Slayer), Mayumi Tanaka (One Piece's Luffy), and Kazura Nakai, who voiced One Piece's Zoro.\n\nThe post Dandadan manga goes on a month-long hiatus appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Back when Final Fantasy XIV and Mountain Dew Gaming announced their collaboration, the world was introduced to their in-game mascot, who goes by the name of Big Sippin’. Now, in the midst of the race to world first in Arcadion Savage, he’s taking center stage once more. \n\n\nThe Arcadion (Savage) World First race is in full swing, and multiple teams have already defeated Black Cat and moved on to Honey B. Lovely, with Echo (formerly Neverland) having just defeated her and moved on to Brute Bomber as I write this sentence. The mechanics are brutal, the deaths are many, and Big Sippin’ is somewhere in the middle of all this. \n\n\n\n\nBig Sippin’ is part of Team Variety Pack, taking on the role of Bard as you’d expect. Currently, the team is lagging behind and still trying to overcome Black Cat, but these races to world first are subject to change at any moment. \n\n\nIt’s heartwarming to see how far Big Sippin’ has come since his journey began. If you’ve followed his story, the could-be legacy player has gone through the entire saga from A Realm Reborn in the last few months, so he’s done remarkably well to get this far in such a short time. He even got hitched.\n\n\nImage via Mountain Dew Gaming\n\n\nIf you want to watch Big Sippin’ take on The Arcadion (Savage) fights, you can do so on Twitch via Wesk Alber’s channel. He’s also on Team Variety Pack, taking up the role of Melee and currently playing as Dragoon. \n\n\nOr, if you want a more overall view of how all participating teams are doing, including both Neverland and Team Variety Pack, you can tune in to the MogTalk stream, where they’re dissecting the mechanics as the teams take on the brutal savage fights.\n\nThe post Big Sippin’, Mountain Dew Gaming’s FFXIV mascot, joins Arcadion (Savage) World First race appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It's been a tough old time for developers trying to bring the Alien franchise to the gaming world. The likes of Colonial Marines had all but killed hopes of a decent adaptation, while Isolation was a beautiful love letter to Ridley Scott's 1979 horror masterpiece. As such, Alien: Rogue Incursion has a lot to live up to.\n\n\nOf course, we can't judge it at this stage, but in the meantime, we have been treated to a new trailer that shows us who the protagonist of the upcoming game will be. In the footage, we get the usual accoutrements associated with the Alien games before cutting to a shot of Zula Hendricks being something of a badass.\n\n\n\n\nCombined with footage from the early build of the game, there's an impression that Rogue Incursion is going for that high-octane, gun-shootin' action that's more akin to James Cameron's vision.\n\n\nHow does Hendricks fit into the Alien universe?\n\n\nDon't worry if you don't know who Zula Hendricks is. I must admit, I had to do a little bit of reading myself to see how she fits into the Alien universe. While she's not been a feature of the films, the Xenopedia page shows that she's more of a comic book character. However, she is apparently mentioned in the novelization of Alien: Isolation.\n\n\nAs such, Hendricks is more of a canonical (if somewhat obscure) character, rather than a brand-new protagonist. How she'll fare against the iconic Xenomorph creatures is anyone's guess at this stage. But she looks like she can hold her own, judging by the above trailer.\n\n\nIt is a shame that Alien: Rogue Incursion is a VR exclusive. I'd wager there are plenty of people who would love to play an action-packed shooter that takes place in the Alien world with a character who is lore-friendly without the use of a headset. Oh well. I guess us non-VR players will just be over here wishing for Isolation 2 instead.\n\nThe post New Alien: Rogue Incursion trailer shows Zula Hendricks as the protagonist appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "About a billion and six years ago, I played an indie puzzle game about connecting and stacking little balls of goo in order to reach an end goal. I realize I'm probably not selling that idea well, but it's exciting to know that the sequel – the aptly named World of Goo 2 – will be releasing at the end of this week.\n\n\nScheduled to come out on August 2, the follow-up to 2008's World of Goo has been in the pipeline for almost 16 years. So much has changed since then, but 2D Boy's upcoming game looks as though it's retaining what made the original such a charming experience.\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Tomorrow Corporation – which is collaborating on the project – the sequel will be \"bursting with undiscovered new species of Goo,\" adding that we'll be able to explore a \"new story spanning hundreds of thousands of years and watch the world change.\"\n\n\nMore like World of Two...amirite?\n\n\nOne thing about World of Goo 2 is that – according to the studio – while you'll be able to buy it off the official website completely DRM-free, it's also going to be available on the Epic Games Store and the Nintendo Switch eShop. Doesn't look like it's coming to Steam or any other platform. Whether this will change cannot be said at this stage.\n\n\nPersonally, I am looking forward to this one. The original had lashings of character, a unique style that blended colorful landscapes with cutscenes that look like they wouldn't be out of place in a Tim Burton animation. Plus all that Goo, innit.\n\n\nIt is a shame the new game won't be on Steam, as the first World of Goo is on there. I would definitely urge anyone who's interested in physics-based puzzle games to give it a go. You'll laugh. You'll cry. You might even goo a bit.\n\nThe post World of Goo 2 drops this Friday, 16 years after the original appeared first on Destructoid.",

But it feels like no book will live up to the last one you read, like The Silent Patient, but there are dozens of them out there for you to sink your teeth into. \n\n\nThe Silent Patient has a thrilling premise: A woman's life is turned upside down because, seemingly out of nowhere, she shoots her husband five times in the head. It's completely out of character for her; at least, that's how it looks from the outside. As a criminal psychotherapist dives into her mind in an attempt to uncover what made this woman snap, he ends up uncovering truths from his own life that he may well have wanted to lay dormant forever. If that sounds good, then I've got a great list of books for you. \n\n…",

Developer Squid Shock Studios revealed that last week's sudden closure of publisher Humble Games has adversely affected its ability to provide timely support to those versions of the game. \n\n\nIn a statement posted to Twitter, Squid Shock Studios states that Humble Games' apparent closure last week, which saw its entire 36-person staff laid off by owner Ziff Davis in what it calls a “restructuring,” has adversely affected its ability to provide post-launch support for the console versions of Bō. The studio states that this is due to the game’s porting and QA support being tied to its deal with Humble. The PC version doesn't appear to be affected, with the studio currently working on updates for that version. Here’s Squid Shock Studios’ full statement:\nA statement on console ports and future updates. pic.twitter.com/PjElxfnYwP\nJuly 29, 2024\nGiven the number of games Humble published, both released and upcoming, this likely isn’t the only game or studio to have this kind of wrench thrown into the works due to the sudden layoffs. If you're planning on picking up Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus, PC seems like the best way to go for the foreseeable future. \nBō: Path of the Teal Lotus is inspired by Japanese folklore, with players controlling a warrior named Bō who descends from Heaven to fulfill an ancient prophecy. Armed with his shapeshifting Bō staff, players traverse a dreamlike, Metroidvania-inspired world battling monsters. Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus is available now for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.",

Square Enix states this is because the final version of this section has been altered “for a more satisfying experience.” Instead, those with save data from the demo who purchase the full game will receive three weapons for Val upon reaching Chapter 1: Gladius, Falx, and Horn Lance. \nFirst revealed at The Game Awards 2023, Visions of Mana marks the first original Mana entry in 15 years.

These three fighters make up half of Kombat Pack 2 and will be available when the DLC launches on September 24. \nIn keeping with the tradition of prior games, the second half of Kombat Pack 2 features guest fighters from various films.

Kombat Pack 2 comes included with Khaos Reigns and cannot be purchased as a standalone character bundle. \n\n\nAnimalities are making their return as a free content update upon Khaos Reigns’ release. First introduced in Mortal Kombat 3, these beastial finishing moves see fighters morph into animals to eviscerate opponents.

During a panel at the San Diego Comic-Con yesterday, the film’s director and producer revealed the movie now has a reduced scope due to budget cuts.\nAs reported by Variety, producer Roy Lee (Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, The Lego Movie) revealed during Collider’s Producers on Producers panel that since the film’s announcement in February 2022, a regime change at Netflix has affected the project. Netflix’s film chief at that time, Scott Stuber, has since been replaced by Dan Lin. While Stuber emphasized large spending for an expansive film slate, Lin has scaled back to a more modest strategy. This means the Bioshock film’s budget has been reduced, with director Francis Lawrence (I Am Legend, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire) stating its been reworked as a “more personal film”. \n“The new regime has lowered the budgets,” Roy Lee said. “So we’re doing a much smaller version. … It’s going to be a more personal point of view, as opposed to a grander, big project.”\nA partnership between Netflix, Bioshock publisher Take-Two Interactive, and Vertigo Entertainment is bringing the Bioshock film to life. In addition to Lawrence and Lee serving as director and producer, respectively, Michael Green (Loga, Blade Runner 2049, American Gods) was announced as its writer in August 2022.\n[Source: Variety]",

That’s because this wacky sandbox dating sim by developer Sassy Chap is all about forming relationships with everyday household objects that, it turns out, are actually pretty hot.\nThe game bestows players with special “Dateviator” glasses that allow them to speak with objects and see them in their true, absurdly attractive forms. Dozens of objects await your affection – even elements like air and water can be courted – and branching dialogue can lead to three relationship resolutions for each character (Love, Friend, Hate). Whatever you decide will be reflected in the ever-changing 3D overworld that is your house. \n\n\nDate Everything boasts over 100 voiced characters played by performers that include Felicia Day (Critical Role, Supernatural), Johnny Yong Bosch (Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, Bleach), and Grey DeLisle (Scooby-Doo, Avatar: The Last Airbender). Given the huge amount of speaking roles, Date Everything boasts 1.2 million words and 70,000 voiced lines. \nDate Everything looks delightfully silly, but it unfortunately doesn’t have a release window. It will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.",

The long-awaited post-apocalyptic shooter was slated to arrive on September 5 but will now launch on November 20 to give developer GSC Game World more time to address technical issues.\nAdditionally, the studio announced it will release its first-ever Developer Deep Dive video to give a comprehensive behind-the-scenes look at the game. The video will feature new gameplay footage, overviews of its world and locations, a full walkthrough of a story quest, and developer interviews. It is being made in collaboration with Xbox and will premiere on August 12. \n\n\nThe delay marks another bump in the road for S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl. It was formally unveiled in 2020 after years of teases at the Xbox Games Showcase but has hit snags along the way, including garnering backlash for now-canceled plans for NFT implementation. The biggest disruption was Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, where GSC Game World is based, which upended development and forced the staff to relocate to Prague, Czech Republic (though some team members actively fought and sadly perished in the war). Despite all of this, the game has managed to come together, and we even played it during Summer Game Fest this year.\nS.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl launches on November 20 for Xbox Series X/S and PC. It will launch day one on Xbox Game Pass. If nothing else, this delay gives players more time to catch up with the Xbox re-release of the original games that arrived earlier this year.",

The price of the sale was not disclosed, but according to a press release, Player First Games will continue to operate under its current leadership of co-founders Tony Huynh and Chris White. \nThe announcement comes only a couple of months after MultiVersus' relaunch on May 28. Player First Games served as a work-for-hire studio on the game, and Warner Bros. is apparently pleased enough with its performance to formally bring the studio in-house. The move comes only a few days after Warner Bros. shuttered the entire mobile division of Mortal Kombat developer Netherrealm Studios. \n“We have worked with Player First Games over several years to create and launch MultiVersus, and we are very pleased to welcome this talented team to Warner Bros. Games,” said David Haddad, president of Warner Bros. Games. “The bright and creative team at Player First Games adds to our extensive development capabilities.”\n“Our team is excited to join the Warner Bros. Games family, and we feel that this will be great for MultiVersus overall,” Huynh said. “We are working to make the MultiVersus game experience the best it can be and having our development team integrated with the publisher is optimum for the players.”\nMultiVersus is a 2v2 spin on the Super Smash Bros. blueprint that pits a variety of characters from different Warner Bros. properties against each other. It was first launched in open beta in 2022 (read our review of that version here), then taken down months later to be rebuilt and expanded before returning this year. MultiVersus recently kicked off its second content season, and it has received new fighters such as The Joker, Agent Smith, Jason Voorhees, and the recently announced Samurai Jack and Beetlejuice.",

          "description": "Helldivers 2 has been one of 2024’s biggest successes, and developer Arrow Head Games is prepping to launch its most substantial update yet. Escalation of Freedom is an upcoming update that adds new missions, new hazards, and, of course, new bugs.\nArriving on August 6, Escalation of Freedom challenges players with a new level 10 difficulty and introduces new mission objectives, such as locating and extracting a crying larva that attracts Terminids. The game also receives new, larger fortress-like outposts for players to capture. The swamp biome gets a spookier facelift, and acid storms can now reduce the armor for players and enemies so both sides take greater damage. New Terminids and Automatons will clash with players, and Arrow Head Games teases that Escalation of Freedom features more surprises players will have to discover on their own. Check out the trailer for a look at what's to come. \n\n\nEscalation of Freedom also brings quality-of-life improvements including an update to address grief kicking. Per the PlayStation Blog, the game is getting \"a system where if a player is kicked, they will spawn into a new session as the host with all of the team’s loot from their previous session. All items can now be picked up by the player before extraction. The squad doing the kicking will see a message in the chat widget that a player has been kicked, yet their loot remains unchanged.\"\nFor more on Helldivers 2, check out our review.",

Developer Behaviour Interactive agreed and enlisted the cinematic storytelling expertise of Supermassive Games (Until Dawn, The Dark Pictures Anthology, The Quarry) to create an original story in the DBD universe. That game became The Casting of Frank Stone, and it terrorizes Game Informer’s cover this month.\n\n\nWe traveled to Behaviour’s studio in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, to play an early slice of the game and speak to lead developers from both studios to learn how the collaboration came to be.

Whether it's a fictional character like Jack Sparrow or a real person like Ariana Grande, it's hard to find a corner of pop culture the game hasn't touched. These crossovers, however, are almost always exclusive to characters, but Fortnite players don't always have to traverse the Battle Royale map on foot – there are vehicles as well. Today's crossover comes in the form of a particularly polygonal vehicle: Tesla's Cybertruck.\nPulls ♾️\n@tesla Cybertruck in Fortnite tomorrow! pic.twitter.com/CA8xuYQreS\nJuly 22, 2024\nFor the unfamiliar, the Cybertruck is one of Tesla's latest electric vehicles, a futuristic-looking pickup truck with a distinct shape and stainless steel exterior. It's a vehicle that, quite frankly, always looked like it belonged in a video game, both because of its angular aesthetic and the word \"cyber\" in its name.\nIt's unclear exactly how the truck will be present in Fortnite, as the trailer doesn't include any actual gameplay, but it's likely a vehicle skin that can be purchased from the in-game store. With car skins attached, whenever a player enters a vehicle, it will morph into the selected skin of their choice, and it's available in Battle Royale and Rocket Racing alike. This is purely speculation, however – it's equally possible the vehicle is introduced in some other limited-time event.\nThe Cybertruck will be added to Fortnite tomorrow. If you drive one, just pray your opposing players aren't wielding a steel ball.\nhow do you feel about the Cybertruck being added to Fortnite? what other vehicles would you like to see in the game?

The mainstay villain has apparently survived his presumed death (again) and is ready to reclaim his throne. \nA cinematic trailer rolls out the red carpet for Heihachi, setting up his return after he was seemingly killed (i.e., tossed into a volcanic lava river) in Tekken 7. The video doesn’t explain how Heihachi managed not to melt into goop, but he does sport a Kazuya-esque scar on his chest now, so he didn’t walk away completely unscathed. \n\n\nHeihachi becomes available sometime this fall. He follows Eddy Gordo and Lidia Sobieska, who joined Tekken 8 in the spring (i.e., July 25) and summer, respectively, leaving one fighter left for the winter season.

          "description": "Paramount has canceled Halo, the live-action TV adaptation of Xbox’s flagship franchise, after two seasons. The show’s second season premiered on Paramount+ earlier this year. \nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter’s sources, Halo showrunners Amblin, Xbox, and 343 Industries are seeking a new outlet for a potential third season, with Paramount reportedly supporting the move. \n“Paramount+ can confirm that ‘Halo’ will not move forward with a third season on the service,” Paramount said in a statement. “We are extremely proud of this ambitious series and would like to thank our partners at Xbox, 343 Industries and Amblin Television, along with showrunner and executive producer David Wiener, his fellow executive producers, the entire cast led by Pablo Schreiber as Master Chief and the amazing crew for all their outstanding work. We wish everyone the best going forward.”\nAfter years of development, Halo premiered on Paramount+ on March 24, 2022, and stars Pablo Schreiber as Master Chief. Season 1 received a mixed reception from critics and fans, with many lambasting it for deviating from the games’ established lore and characterizations. Season 2, which premiered earlier this year on February 8 and concluded on March 21, was received more positively, with several critics and viewers hailing it as a dramatic improvement. Season 1 currently sits at 70% on Rotten Tomatoes/61 on Metacritic. Season 2 garnered a 90% on Rotten Tomatoes/64 on Metacritic. \nFor our thoughts on Halo Season 1, check out our video reviews of each episode. You can also read our February interview with the showrunners about how they planned to make Season 2 feel more faithful to the games.",

          "description": "Skeleton Crew, the team behind the 2021 side-scrolling action game Olija, and Devolver Digital have revealed an intriguing new project: Forestrike. The game sports a unique premise: as a martial artist, you can foresee and simulate future combat encounters, allowing you to perfect your execution before laying a finger on anyone. \nThe fighter battles to free a captive Emperor from an evil Admiral, and doing so involves mastering Foresight, a meditative technique to mentally predict and play out battles before they unfold (for Dragon Ball fans, think of image training). Gameplay-wise, players are pitted against different combinations of enemy types. They use Foresight to play the battle in advance to find the optimal approach to defeating them while taking little to no damage.\nFor example, using Foresight may help you learn to dodge a charging enemy so they trample an ally, then finish him off by lobbing a nearby weapon. Determining the best approach may take several Foresight attempts, but once you have your strategy down, you then execute the battle in real-time. After winning a fight, a replay feature allows you to rewatch it using slow-motion and other editing tools to study your strategy or generally feel cool about your performance. \n\n\nUsing the Foresight makes Forestrike's combat feel puzzle-like in its execution, and winning fights as flawlessly as possible matters. That’s because you have limited health to fight through multiple stages in a roguelike-style branching map. Along the way, you’ll earn upgrades that carry over to future runs, as well as perks called Techniques that enhance your abilities. \nForestrike is a neat spin on the action genre, and it's slated to launch sometime in 2025 for Switch and PC.",

With its servers regularly buckling under the weight of its players, the game caught lightning in a bottle but petered out when the game finally went 1.0 and simultaneously ceased receiving support in 2022. Now, developer 1047 Games is back with Splitgate 2 and aims to refine the original's winning formula. \n\n\nLike the first game, Splitgate 2 will be a free-to-play 4v4 shooter that arms players with a portal gun and more traditional firearms to battle each other in aerial, dimension-hopping combat. The sequel is being built in Unreal Engine 5 and has a new emphasis on factions. Players can suit up to compete in the Sol Splitgate League as members of one of three groups: the agile Aeros, the time-manipulating Meridian, or the trigger-happy Sabrask. According to a press release, “Factions will grant players the ability to choose and progress based on their preferred gameplay style or competitive strategies.” Splitgate 2 will feature new objective-based game modes across new arenas and upgradable weapons. \nAdditionally, a special Splitgate 2 companion app is available to download now. The app lets players explore the game’s universe through collectibles that unlock in-game rewards when Splitgate 2 launches. It also features quizzes and a new comic series called Splitgate: The Games We Play. The five-issue series will flesh out the backstory of the characters featured in the announcement trailer and additional issues will arrive monthly. \nSplitgate 2 launches in 2025 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Check out the first batch of screenshots below.",

Video game adaptations can be a bit of a mixed bag sometimes, but in this case, fans and critics alike (us included) loved its characters, world-building, and its overall take on the Fallout universe. It should come as no surprise, then, that the show has been nominated in numerous categories at the 2024 Emmy Awards.\nFallout was nominated in 16 categories, but two of them are particularly exciting. First, the show is one of eight nominees for Outstanding Drama Series, ranking it among other big shows of 2024, like Shōgun, which currently leads the pack with 25 nominations.

          "description": "Nintendo is, relatively speaking, a family-oriented company. Their games are aimed at kids, their parents, and everyone in between with bright colors, wholesome storytelling, and extremely approachable game design. That said, there are exceptions to this rule, like in this creepy 15-second teaser uploaded to the company's YouTube channel last week. A man in a trench coat wearing a paper bag with a smile drawn on it stares into the camera while a distorted music box plays in the background. The only additional context we got was the hashtag #WhoIsEmio, leaving fans scrambling to figure out what exactly this was hinting at.\nToday, that mystery has been cleared up. Emio, also known as \"The Smiling Man,\" is the star of a new game in the Famicom Detective Club series, which hasn't had a new entry in 35 years. The game was revealed today alongside a video featuring series producer Yoshio Sakamoto, who wrote the first two games and went on to direct titles like Super Metroid and Metroid: Zero Mission. According to him, they decided to make this new entry during their time developing the Famicom Detective Club remakes back in 2021.\n\"In Emio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club, a student has been found dead in a chilling fashion, his head covered with a paper bag with an eerie smiling face drawn on it,\" a press release reads. \"This unsettling visage bears a striking resemblance to a recurring clue in a string of unsolved murders from 18 years ago, as well as Emio (the Smiling Man), a killer of urban legend who is said to grant his victims 'a smile that will last forever.'\" Players will assume the role of a private investigator and set out to solve the case and stop the killer for good.\nEmio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club will be released for the Nintendo Switch next month, on August 29. Hopefully, the titular killer won't murder too many people before then.\nAre you excited to see this series revived? Let us know in the comments!",

Amid a wave of price reductions and other end-of-life updates, nostalgic fans can relive the console's earliest days via a new dynamic background modeled after the old “Blades” interface.\nFor those too young to remember or didn’t get an Xbox 360 until years later, the Blades interface was the console's first dashboard design. It was the first thing players saw from the console’s launch in 2005 until it was updated to an entirely different interface in 2008. Navigating it felt smooth as butter, and some diehards still believe it's the best UI of any Xbox console. \nAlthough it's less detailed, and you can’t flip through the Blades of this dynamic background and hear that satisfying “whoosh” sound, it’s nice to see Microsoft acknowledge the 360's like this.
