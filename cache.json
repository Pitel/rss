These games, I am convinced, were never really designed to be completed, but to be played exactly like this, as a coin-gobbling invitation to become a bandana-wearing sisyphus, a tiny Rambo pushing a bouncy, juddering tank up a hill occupied by cartoon nazis. You die a bunch and say: \"ah, that was good.\"\nSo what happens when you rearrange the molecules of this run and/or gun 'em up into an isometric turn-based strategy game? You get Metal Slug Tactics, an off-kilter nod to Into The Breach and other grid-based turn-takers, but secretly housing the aggressive notions of an unhinged pyromaniac. You still die a lot.

I reviewed Digital Extremes' hit free-to-play shooter in 2013, back when people were still calling it a spiritual successor to the developer's boomerang-throwing action game Dark Sector. I didn't like Warframe much at the time. Think I gave it a 6/10. Warp forward a decade, and that 6/10 game has become a thriving live service phenomenon - fifteenth on the Steam Most Played charts at the time of writing, and profitable enough to spawn its own annual TennoCon expo. It's also become an intoxicating, confusing morass of dynastic sci-fantasy politicking and genre-shifting expansions, ranging from capital ship mechanics to questions of time travel, wrapped in layers of cosmetics that make Destiny look about as colourful as Gears Of War. \r\n\n\r\nI definitely didn't see all that coming. I doubt Digital Extremes saw it coming either. Warframe today feels like a lab experiment run amok. I love its appetite for novelty, but there's a lot for a returning player to catch up on and, frankly, it feels like homework. As such, I had a couple of broad motivations for playing Soulframe's pre-alpha \"prelude\": I'm keen to see what Digital Extremes can do when they aren't encumbered by 10 years of world-building, and I want to get in on the ground floor before they absolutely swamp this thing in updates.\r\n \nRead more",

Didn’t even see it coming.\nUpdate 1.1’s new unit is the Phantom Ray, which Game River describe as \"a medium-sized aircraft with high HP that excels at striking enemies at close range with high-damage missiles\". It’s a mid-tier flier, costing 50 to unlock and 200 to field, and for that you get three of them per unit. As for default tech, you’ve got some range and fire rate unlocks, alongside an oil drop. The headliner here is the stealth buff, which cloaks the Phantom Ray by default until it attacks. When it does, it all gets a nice 40% bonus to damage.\nRead more",

Introduced on Razer’s Huntsman V3 Pro series and quickly followed by Wooting’s (functionally distinct but effectively identical) Rappy Snappy, Snap Tap is now wearing multiple names as it takes over the world of RGB peripherals, from SteelSeries’ Rapid Tap to Corsair’s FlashTap and Keychron’s... Last Keystroke Prioritisation. Which doesn’t sound as sexy, but still.\nHowever, Snap Tap is also drawing a level of ire that exceeds the usual baseline scepticism of hardware marketing. Because it enables a form of input automation – where you can quickly move in two directions by rapidly tapping one key, while holding down another – it’s considered by some as tantamount to cheating, allowing players to cross the line that divides unfair play from the accepted comforts that come with simply using a responsive Hall Effect keyboard or high-refresh-rate monitor. It’s even become a bannable offence in certain games, most notably in Counter-Strike 2.\nNeither side is backing down; in an astonishingly worded tweet, Wooting went as far as to concede Snap Tap \"should be considered cheating. But if it’s allowed, you need it.\" But do you?\nRead more",

I haven't really thought about it before, but Rift Riff's effusively laidback crowd control has me pondering those optimal moments in any tower defender when the incoming horde hits the flamer-MG triangle just right, and you can settle back comfortably into the role of clockwatcher.\nRift Riff encourages this behaviour by being nice to look at. Created by a trio of developers including Hidden Folks designer Adriaan de Jongh, it's a world of spacey, sun-carved mountains, forests and monoliths. The towers resemble the sacred architecture of Monument Valley, and the colour scheme and general ambience remind me of Cocoon. There's a demo, if you fancy it.\n Read more",

          "description": "Nostalgia, when you think about it, is bollocks. There has never been a better time than right this second – averaged out, and despite repeated attempts to the contrary, humanity has never been healthier, freer, or more enlightened by knowledge. It’s true of games too. For every by-committee platter of passionless map markers, there are thousands of more personal, more creative, more interesting works, all adding to the decades' worth of great stuff we can still play today.\nWhat isn’t bollocks is the emotional pull that nostalgia, for all its lack of cold, hard reason, still manages to wield inside our warm, squishy brains. Hence, the centrepiece of Apex Legends’ Season 23 update is a mode that recreates the battle royale FPS as it was back in 2019, defaulting back to the original map and weapon arsenal while cutting the 26-strong legend roster to the earliest ten. It’s a Fortnite-style rolling back of the clock, and a passably enjoyable one, but also a reminder that the good old days weren’t always that good.\nRead more",

          "description": "Putting aside my natural annoyance at Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater for almost beating out the Twarhammer series in the headline real estate wars, I am more than a little excited to play. Some days, you simply must feast on a tree frog, and while we still don’t have a solid release date, that day doesn’t feel too far away. Good news for stealth fans, and perhaps gooder news for a dozen strapline writers sweating profusely, soiling themselves in anticipation of using “kept you waiting, huh?”.\nUntil then, I at least have a steady drip feed of new information to keep me sated, the latest of which is the substantial hint that there'll be some new dialogue in the game, as per the video below. Alongside that, the previously pseudonymous Suzetta Miñet - who was credited with voicing EVA in MGS3 and Peace Walker - has revealed herself to be Jodi Benson, the voice of Ariel in Disney’s The Little Mermaid. Cheers for the spot, Automaton West.\nRead more",

For those wanting to quantify the performance difference between eight and twelve memory channels with AMD EPYC 9005 \"Turin\" processors, here are some benchmarks for showing the workloads that can really benefit from all 12 memory channels and other workloads where eight memory channels can be largely sufficient if looking to minimize costs.",

          "description": "Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl has some impressive QoL features, one of them being the presence of a fast travel system, which will help you save time and energy.\n\n\nThe Exclusion Zone is pretty massive, and you'll have a fair idea if you've played the previous Stalker titles. Reaching a spot for the first time is one thing, but having to do the same stuff repeatedly becomes boring and wastes time. This can be prevented entirely with the help of NPCs to quickly travel between different locations.\n\n\nStalker 2 fast travel explained\n\n\nWhen you reach a settlement like Rostok for the first time, you'll find several NPCs over there. Some of these NPCs are useful for handing out different quests. Others are people of interest - individuals who will help you access the different features. You need to find someone called the Guide.\n\n\nIf you can't locate this person manually, always feel free to use the map. The marker for the Guide appears in white and looks like a star. Once you interact with the Guide, you can get to pick other locations. There's a catch - a location is only going to be active if you have met the Guide in that spot.\n\n\nAdditionally, you'll have to spend coupons to fast travel, so it's not a free thing in Stalker 2. Hence, plan your travel and quest completion accordingly, which will reduce your need for fast travel.\n\n\nImage via GSC Gameworld\n\n\nAre there any restrictions to fast travel in Stalker 2\n\n\nWell, you can't fast travel if you don't have enough resources in the first place. But that's not the only restriction you've to worry about. In Stalker 2, things happen in the background, and some of the locations are attacked. In such cases, you won't be able to access the NPCs, and this means that fast travel will be temporarily off.\n\n\nThere might also be certain missions that will force you not to use the fast travel feature at times. Excluding such occasions, you should be able to quickly travel between two spots without any problem.\n\nThe post How to fast travel in Stalker 2 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Flint is a useful resource in Towers of Aghasba as it is needed to make all sorts of important crafts in the game. Here's where you can find it in abundance.\n\n\nHow to find Flint in Towers of Aghasba\n\n\nAt the start of the game, Flint is an unobtainable resource because you need to craft yourself a Pickaxe to start harvesting it. A bit into the main story, you'll be given the recipe to craft a Stone Pickaxe via the Craft menu. This menu can be accessed and used from anywhere in the world.\n\n\nTo craft a Stone Pickaxe, you'll need Stone, Stick, and Fiber in specific amounts:\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\n\n2 x Stick - Picked up off the ground.\n\n\n3 x Stone - Picked up off the ground.\n\n\n2 x Fiber - Harvested from wild bushes on the ground\n\n\n\nOnce you have your Stone Pickaxe made, you now can gather Flint. Flint is harvested from Boulders found scattered around the wilderness.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThe amount you obtain depends on the quality of the Pickaxe you use. With the Stone Pickaxe, you'll only obtain about one or two per boulder, but there are always plenty of them scattered around.\n\n\nWhat is Flint used for in Towers of Aghasba\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nFlint is used to create several useful items, and you'll need a lot of it throughout your time in Towers of Aghasba. Early on, you'll use it to craft early-game weapons such as Spears and Arrows. You'll also use it to create basic tools/structures like the Construction Table and Standard Mining Hut. Flint, as a material, may become less valuable as your technology advances, but it is still a highly useful resource worth stockpiling.\n\nThe post Where to get Flint in Towers of Aghasba appeared first on Destructoid.",

Except for the Skif's Pistol, all weapons cost money to repair. Once you've completed the first upgrade, Skif's Pistol will also cost money to repair.\n\n\nRepairing will have made sense, but you can also find new weapons in the world. Just switching them will be a far more convenient option and save your resources in the process. However, feel free to repair one if it becomes your favorite.\n\nThe post Stalker 2: How to repair weapons appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The Kingdom Hearts 2 Timeless River world has always been black and white as it's inspired by the first Disney cartoon Steamboat Willie. However, the world received a Technicolor mod on Saturday that gives it a colorful tone. \n\n\nCreated by danimalforlife on Nexusmods, all of the character models and the world's environments are in color. Sora wears his signature red outfit from the first game, while Donald and Goofy are in their classic blue and green get-ups. As the trailer that danimalforlife has showcased demonstrates, it's quite a vast difference from the original black and white look. \n\n\n\"Everything from the textures, to journal history, to pictures, has been given color,\" explains the modder in the Nexusmods listing. \n\n\n\n\nThis mod is only available to PC players. You'll need to use KHPCPatchManager and OpenKH to turn on this Technicolor style in Timeless River. Thankfully, Nexusmods claims that the files are clean, as the virus scan claims they are \"safe to use.\" Nevertheless, this Kingdom Hearts 2 Timeless River mod is impressive for those who love the beloved Disney series.\n\n\nRecently, Steamboat Willie has been claimed as fair use. This means that anyone can use the assets of the cartoon for their project. However, it may get tricky as you have to specifically use this version of Mickey and not the modern interpretation. \n\n\nSome games have taken the old-school animation art style and made them their own. Cuphead successfully grabbed the attention of many with its difficult gameplay and eye-popping art style that looks ripped from the early 20th century. Mouse: P.I. For Hire is also going old-school with black and white graphics with a first-person shooter. It's inspired by the hand-drawn rubber hose animation and jazz soundtracks of the era. It releases sometime in 2025. \n\nThe post Kingdom Hearts 2’s amazing Timeless River world gets a very cool Technicolor mod appeared first on Destructoid.",

They argue that the court erred in holding that piracy damages should be calculated per album, rather than per song. They argue that this decision, which will lower the $47 million damages award, doesn't reflect the way that music is commercialized today.\nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",

          "description": "Castle Master, the haunting conclusion to the Freescape engine saga, is now ready for public testing!\nPrepare yourself for a perilous adventure as you lower the drawbridge to enter the Castle Master’s domain. Released in 1990 by Incentive Software, Castle Master became popular for its technical innovation and challenging gameplay. The game inspired countless 3D adventure titles, and the Freescape engine itself marked a technological milestone, enabling groundbreaking object interaction and spatial puzzles.\nNotably, Castle Master was one of the first games to let you choose to play as either a prince or a princess, offering a different experience depending on your choice.\nYour mission: rescue your twin, imprisoned within the eerie depths of Castle Eternity by the evil Magister. This sprawling, foreboding castle is filled with traps, monsters, and puzzles blocking your path. Gather items, unlock doors, and solve complex riddles as you navigate the labyrinthine halls and confront the dark forces within.\nThis modern reimplementation showcases enhanced graphics using OpenGL, with initial support for the DOS and ZX Spectrum releases. If you’re eager to embark on this dark journey, a playable demo is available to test your tenacity.\nTo participate in the testing, ensure you have a daily development build. We encourage all players to submit feedback and bug reports through our issue tracker.\nWill you brave the creepy corridors of Castle Eternity and free your sibling, or will you fall victim to the Magister’s curse and join his army of enslaved spirits? The adventure awaits!\n>",

          "description": "After seven months of intense work, we are ready to announce support for a few games based on qdEngine, developed by K-D Labs.\nThe work is based on the original sources published now under GPL, although the work started a bit earlier than that. The engine supports 14 games, five of which we are announcing support for. Most of these games were released in Russian; however, there were Lithuanian, Czech, and Polish releases. The support is announced for:\nWait for it! Issue 3. Song for a Hare, (Russian: Ну, погоди! Выпуск 3. Песня для зайца, Lithuanian: Na, palauk!

Also, we are looking for the Lithuanian version of Little Longnose and Polish releases of Little Mice games and Wait for it! game. If you happen to have a copy, please contact sev.\nWe continue the active development so that support for other games will follow shortly.

This is the first of a small number of games built using the DGDS (Dynamix Game Development System) engine.\nThe Dynamix name may be familiar – bought by Sierra in 1990, the Dynamix brand continued and became well known for action and puzzle games like The Incredible Machine, A10 Tank Killer, and Red Baron.  They also made a few adventures using the custom DGDS engine.\nRise of the Dragon is set in Los Angeles in a dark version of the future, circa 2053.  You play as Blade Hunter, a private investigator and retired police officer.  After a designer drug kills the mayor's rebellious daughter, Chandra, Hunter is hired to find the people responsible for releasing the drug on the streets. What Blade ultimately finds is much more than he expected.  Rise of the Dragon combines classic point-and-click adventure style with platforming arcade sequences, giving a unique gameplay combination.\nYou’ll need the latest daily build of ScummVM and files from the DOS version of the game, which you can buy at GOG (check our wiki for the required data files).  Please file any issues you notice on our bug tracker.\n>",
