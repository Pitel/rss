          "description": "UnFunny, but UnExpectedly good regardless.\nComedy video games. This writer's blood runs cold just to think of them. In a medium that sees you define your own pace, how can comedy possibly work without fundamentally transforming the medium from interactive to inert? The comedy and the gameplay are necessarily completely separate and so few games have managed to integrate the two in any truly impressive way just yet. Undertale, perhaps, but there's still a lot of sitting around reading dialogue in that.\nUnMetal is... a comedy video game. A parody, if you will, and unfortunately not the Parodius kind. What we've got here is an affectionate ribbing of gaming in general, presented in the guise of a stealth game akin to the original MSX Metal Gear, being a quasi-top-down sorta-stealth game. We say \"sorta\" because the enemies in UnMetal are dumber than a box of particularly uneducated rocks, but that isn't really the point. In fact, playing this thing barely seems to be the point — it's so fragmented in its style that it almost feels like a minigame collection. You jump from cutscene to marginal exploration to adventure game-style item-combinations to more cutscenes to a shoot-out to... well, you get the idea.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

They’re separated by the Queen in accordance with a draconian tradition that sees children roll a dice on their twelfth birthday to determine their station for the rest of their life. When Odd is whisked away, Even sets off to find her, befriending as she goes a magical dice named... Dicey.\nThe world is structured in six realms — linked to the faces of the dice — from Onecroft, the lowliest of the low, to Sixtopia, representing a fantasy life of luxury with the Queen. Even starts off in Onecroft and set off to find Odd in Sixtopia, passing in turn through Two-Town, Threedom, etc. The gateways between realms can be opened only when you have enough pips on your dice, and those are acquired by completing quests in the world as you explore. In the course of traversing the towns to find and complete these quests, you encounter battles.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Just made public, the patent was first placed in March 2020.\nPatents are always a rather intriguing thing to track in the technology industry - sometimes they represent ideas and products that'll never see the light of day, but there are occasions when they give clues to future releases. A freshly released US patent application could be the latter, as it addresses technology that could allow Nintendo to boost visuals in its hardware.\nOpened on 25th March 2020 and released publicly yesterday (30th September), the application is titled 'systems and methods for machine learned image conversion', and though the initial language can be a headscratcher it is essentially an idea similar to NVIDIA's DLSS. That's short for Deep Learning Super Sampling in NVIDIA's case, which works on some of its GPUs to upscale image resolution and quality in real time, while also being remarkably efficient and ensuring that the graphics card is under less strain. It's impressive technology, and it's been front and centre in a lot of talk about how Nintendo could produce a new Switch-style portable device that outputs higher resolution visuals while still working with low power output. Digital Foundry has explored this in detail.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It also unveiled a surprise new title called Dungeon Encounters, which is directed by Hiroyuki Ito and will feature the ATB (Active Time Battle) system that he pioneered for the Final Fantasy series. It's arriving very soon, too, with a 14th October release date for Switch eShop - it's priced at $29.99USD / £24.99, though is currently 20% off on pre-orders.\nAs you can see in the trailer it's going for a minimalist, grid-based approach to dungeon crawling. You explore and have to pay attention to hex-based numbers, with trial and error likely to be key to clearing each dungeon. It's not just battles that trigger events, either, as the official website states that every action and pick-up - such as visiting shops etc - will also be an 'event' on the map.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

At 20GB-odd, The Market Of Light is a hefty download for its 15-20 run-time, but this freeform exploration game is absolutely worth a look if your PC meets its surprisingly reasonable tech requirements - especially if you're a fan of games that feature cooking. Seriously, Epic's Tomb Raider lady can get stuffed. For me, Unreal Engine 5 is all about delicious-looking next-gen food.  \nRead more",

The music flares, enemies die, it is carnage.\nBut when I actually give action a go in the game, I'm mostly left dead in seconds.

But upon playing the game, people have already discovered that it's a fair bit tougher than it looks. More Dark Souls, than Zelda, perhaps.\nJust because Tunic isn't dark and gloomy doesn't mean it can't offer its fair share of challenges, so I spoke to Tunic creator Andrew Shouldice to find out how he's managing expectations, as well as tackling difficulty and accessibility.

Unfortunately, the MMORPG's popularity has caused an awful lot of queuing, with players having to wait hours to get their preferred servers. Amazon Games have announced a sort of workaround for that, though. Over the next two weeks, if you get your character started on a lower player count server, the devs will let you transfer them for free to the server you want to settle down in.\r\n\n \nRead more",

A quick initiation for those who aren’t RPG diehards - respec simply refers to the process of refunding and reallocating things like skill and attribute points that are common to the genre. Respecing in many modern RPGs is a simple, repeatable process, but things aren’t quite so easy in Diablo 2: Resurrected. While you will earn a few easy respec opportunities, once you’ve used them getting another will be a fittingly grindy process. To make sure you don’t waste your chances and cripple your build, we’ll walk you through all the ways to respec your character in Diablo 2: Resurrected.\nRead more",

The original The World Ends With You impressed audiences on Nintendo DS as much for the game’s stylish Tokyo setting as it did for a unique battle system that saw players control multiple characters on multiple screens simultaneously. Yet what made this game really memorable was how it transformed the fashion and pop-cultural power of Shibuya into its own JRPG battle system. Your drip gave you strength, your armor made you a trendsetter, and the music and energy of the city were translated into a story about coming-of-age, self-worth and finding strength in yourself and your friends by embracing the things that make you unique. \nNow, NEO: The World Ends With You has arrived, but this long-awaited sequel is far from a simple retread of what the first game did 15 years ago. Shibuya itself has changed a lot in the intervening years and it's fascinating to see how NEO's setting and its gameplay mechanics have evolved alongside it. \nRead more",

          "description": "As they always do, things in Steam are likely to change again. Unlike Valve's Steam Labs experiments for storefront discoverability or downstream effects of the upcoming Steam Deck, this one is a little more under the hood. As spotted by the unaffiliated Steam tracking site SteamDB, the beta version of Steam's client now has a new method that is capable of preventing users from accessing former builds of games they own. The majority of players likely aren't pulling up old game builds often, if ever, but this change could make life a lot tougher for modders, speedrunners, and anyone trying to roll back a buggy game update while they wait for a hotfix.\r\n\n \nRead more",

No surprise then that I also got sucked into watching Kate, Netflix's new action movie starring assassin Mary Elizabeth Winstead and her teen hostage slash sidekick Miku Martineau. What is surprising—even though Netflix have shown an increasing interest in games—is that Kate is getting a tie-in action game called Kate: Collateral Damage. It's a fast-paced and arcade-y roguelike with some twin-stick style shooting coming out in October.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I swapped out my mouse and headset, practiced grenade line-ups for hours and even learned a few Russian phrases to try and get the respect of my match-making teammates. All these steps worked, but the real results came when I swapped my old 144Hz monitor for a 240Hz model, the Samsung CRG5. Hitting such a high frame-rate in Counter-Strike isn't difficult even on old hardware, and the increase in clarity meant hitting shots a lot easier. \nIf you want to follow in my footsteps, then it's good news: this 240Hz screen is going cheap on Amazon today. They're asking £229 for it, £70 off its regular price of £299, and I think that's a great deal. \nRead more",

          "description": "Potion Craft came out in early access last week, and while I still think the economy and haggling bits need a little tweaking, I am really enjoying the methodical nature of being an alchemist. It's part art, part science, because you have to sort of feel your way around the potion map and fudge recipes with the ingredients you have. Your recipe book is limited, so I've started writing down extra recipes in real life, crossing things out and updating them as I find better combinations. It's just like being a real backwoods alchemist throwing twigs in a bucket!\nBut my favourite thing is the pestle and mortar. Smashing ingredients up (and grinding them into sludge) awakens their properties so they move further on your potion map, like how crushing mint will make for a livelier mojito.
