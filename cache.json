If you weren't already impressed with this technical feat, this palm-sized project has now shared a new update.\nIn a new video on YouTube, Barretto has shown off a handful of improvements including a complete rework of Mario's model - with some \"improved proportions and better textures\". The limbs of Mario have also been made \"wider\" so that they're easier to see at this low resolution.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It has now been occupied by Russia for almost two years, during which, as reported by the Associated Press, Russia has demolished, rebuilt and renamed much of the city, overwriting its Ukrainian heritage.\nThe Disco Elysium-inspired RPG Hollow Home is a memory of Mariupol from just before the war - not a 1:1 recreation, but a collection of details, colours, personalities and some familiar buildings, painstakingly amassed and offered up in the face of erasure. Speaking to me during a very brief demo at Digital Dragons in Poland this year, artist Anastasia Hlyniana called my attention to the plants jutting from old car tyres around the game's isometric map, which she says are a common sight in Mariupol.\n Read more",

A house on which garden gnomes have either settled, like the avian hoodlums in Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds, or from which they have erupted, like the malignant mushrooms of Annihilation.\nA hundred clay and plaster eyes catch yours, unblinking; a hundred figures seemingly freeze in the act of pushing a toy wheelbarrow or smoking a pipe. The tune you were whistling dies in your throat as you hurry past into the reassuring shadow of the relatively gnomeless bungalows to either side. Gardening sim Horticular is like that, but with an even greater sense of contrast, because it asks you to resettle a desolate planet. There is no generic urban scenery to hurry onto, here. There is only bare, cracked earth. And the gnomes.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "The tabletop equivalent of “buying books and reading them are two different hobbies” is surely the difference between buying sexy tabletop RPG manuals and actually dragging your mates on to Discord for a few hours to stumble your way through a module. It’s the dogeared Fighting Fantasy from a carboot sale kid in me, I think. Something about reading worldbuilding snippets organised into numbered tables just hits in a way a novel doesn’t. Such tantalising ephemera is the name of the game in Microprose-published CrossOver: Roll For Initiative. It’s a wave defense where you play match-3 to collect dice, then spend them on fireballs and mace swings to stop tiny bastards from marauding all over your actual character sheet and attacking your stats.\n \nRead more",

          "description": "The Fear & Hunger games are pitch-black horror RPGs quite unlike anything else I’ve ever played, taking aspects of JRPG, survival horror and adventure games and distilling them into something I’d be tempted to call bleakly nihilistic if they didn’t display so much evident love for their craft. They also both start with a content warning listing “extreme violence, gore, sexual violence, and drug usage”. You’ll want to take this seriously, and just to be clear: the third item on this list does manifest in some tasteless, albeit brief, ways in the first game. It’s a frustrating blemish on what is otherwise an incredibly evocative and creative series, though you can download a mod to censor the more egregious bits. You will miss the full effect of critically severing an ogre’s massive schlong, however.\n \nRead more",

You will lose all your progress, all your precious swords and accomplishments.\nBut is this true? How likely are you to really suffer a catastrophic loss of shotgun shells?

          "description": "Besides giving The First Descendant the ol’ benchy marks on desktop, I was curious to see how this gleaming looter shooter would run on the less flexing hardware of the Steam Deck. The answer: it didn’t, at first. Luckily, a semi-quick fix was enough to get me in, where I found a game that for all its ray tracing inclinations, is comfortable with life on the Deck. Reasonably. Most of the time.\nWith any luck, my issue could be purged completely by the time The First Descendant releases on July 2nd. Partly because I was using a technically non-final preview build, and partly because the problem itself was a silly one: launching was blocked by a case of missing Visual C++, something that the Steam Deck’s Proton compatibility witchcraft usually takes care of. Come on, Proton lad, you’re kinda dropping the ball here.\nIf this ever happens to you, in The First Descendant or any other game, I heartily recommend YouTuber JD Ros’ video tutorial on fixing it. The method boils down to installing the latest C++ versions via the Steam Deck’s Desktop Mode, then adding their executables to the game’s launch options. This worked a treat for me, and I didn’t suffer any further compatibility headaches from there on out.\n Read more",

Metaphor: ReFantazio, the first (going by the colon usage) in a new series of RPGs helmed by Persona series director Katsura Hashino, is no exception. It might be set in a medieval fantasy realm, a relatively straight-laced world of square masonry and parchment maps, but it portrays bread-and-butter RPG fixtures with much the same flair as its strutting high school cousin.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It’s a ponderous, pained roll, creaky and ancient. If it has i-frames, the ‘i’ stands for “I would like to not do that again for at least five minutes, please.” Each time you roll, or sprint, your character wipes beads of sweat from his brow, and you can tell the exertion is genuinely taxing. My man is exhausted. Also, surrounded by fish, both symbolic and literal.\n \nRead more",

Upcoming expansions will focus heavily on the Immortal Empires megamap campaign, and there were lord and unit reveals for the Ogres, Greenskins, and Khorne factions that headline the next DLC - slated for the \"back end of the year\". Certain party poopers among you will be pleased to know that I cannot accurately refer to the 17 minute video below as a “tray-tray”.\n \nRead more",

          "description": "The internet doesn't exist in the world depicted by the film Aliens, though variations of it crop up in the expanded universe. Nor does the idea of a digital society. There's networked communications tech, but it consists of signals between bodies in deepest space, light years apart, of lonely video terminals in cramped dockloader apartments, and of maniacally collaged CCTV feeds of Marines getting their asses kicked, man. There's no ocean of online interactions, corroding the everyday from all directions, just 1-to-1s through boxy, retro-futurist screens that are so dingy and inadequate it feels like Ripley and Burke are peering at each other through a letterbox. Small wonder, given that Aliens was released in 1986, when what would become the internet was still mostly the province of universities and the military. \r\n \nRead more",

Your gumshoe ‘tagonist wakes up, hungover of brain, skint of wallet, and unshaven of face, to discover your apartment - undoubtedly reeking of smokerettes and dehydration wee - is being broken into by foes goonly and mookish. They take a while to boot the door down, which gives you a moment to observe the place and consider which of Fallen Aces' expansive makeshift weapon selection you'd like to batter them with. Decisions, decisions...\n\r\nAfter eating some fridge fruit, I prepare an ambush by flicking off the lightswitch, then hide behind a desk. When they break in, I bravely sneak up behind them and put the frying pan I picked up to work. The sound effects tell me this a quality bit of cookware. Probably cast iron. Barely a dent. In the pan.\n \nRead more",

          "description": "The beauty of modern gaming is a wide variety of control options. Mouse and keyboard, a traditional controller, or even a banana, the options are limitless. Speaking of options, if you plan on playing The First Descendant with a controller, I highly recommend adjusting those settings or you'll be spending as much time fighting the controls as the Vulgus.\n\n\nBreak free of the default settings' chains\n\n\n\nNormal Button Settings: Default\n\n\nMovement / Viewpoint Control Settings: Default\n\n\nCursor Speed: 29\n\n\nVibration Function: On\n\n\nAdaptive Triggers: On\n\n\nInvert X Axis: Off\n\n\nInvert Y Axis: Off\n\n\nX Axis Normal Sensitivity: 100\n\n\nY Axis Normal Sensitivity: 100\n\n\nX Axis Aim Sensitivity: 50\n\n\nY Axis Aim Sensitivity: 30\n\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThe default settings for the controller are fine if you're constantly aiming down sights. However, the X Axis turn speed is painfully slow, especially considering how enemies in open-world missions will come from every direction with or without the accompaniment of artillery fire. In addition to adjusting that, the Y Axis should also be increased to provide a more fluid experience.\n\n\nDisabling the Aim Assist Function is the next step. It might seem counterproductive to do so, but The First Descendant has a nasty habit of pulling your aim towards the center mass of a combatant. This makes things like shooting critical spots and floating orbs harder than they should be. Don't fret too much about becoming less accurate as targeting is still pretty generous. You'll still be able to hit your marks, from the smallest Vulgus gremlin to the biggest Colossus.\n\n\nThose three changes will make a world of difference during combat. I also recommend turning up the cursor speed to make menu navigation quicker. As for the Adaptive Triggers, that option is entirely up to you.

          "description": "The Roblox error code 277 has been an ongoing issue for players throughout the years, ultimately logging them out of the server. It primarily appears for PC users and can sometimes trigger for specific titles. We're here to show you how to fix error code 277 in Roblox to get you back in the game.\n\n\nRoblox error code 277 solutions\n\n\nYou can fix the Roblox error code 277 with the following methods:\n\n\n\nCheck Roblox's server status\n\n\nEnsure that your internet connection is stable\n\n\nDisable VPNs\n\n\nSwitch to Ethernet\n\n\nCreate a new account\n\n\nSwitch to another device\n\n\n\nPlayers should always check Roblox's server status first since the error code may be tied to a network error. To do this, go to the Down Detector or Roblox Status pages for the latest news. You should also check on your internet connection, as the error code can appear more frequently with an unstable system. Once your connection has been fixed, restart the game to ensure it works properly. \n\n\nImage via Roblox Corporation\n\n\nIf you're still seeing error code 277 in Roblox, disable any VPNs you may have. This feature can disrupt the connection to the platform, so it's best to remove it, at least while playing the game. You can also play it on another device, like a mobile phone or console, to get rid of the issue. Since the error code tends to show up more with PC, other platforms may be your only option.\n\n\nPlayers have also mentioned that creating a new account has solved this problem. However, it isn't the best technique if you've got loads of content in your current file. I suggest using this method as a last resort to save your progress.\n\nThe post How to fix error code 277 in Roblox appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, the port is making “slow but steady progress.” They’re expecting a release candidate to be ready for August, and if that is up to standards, they can begin the certification process. However, they aren’t able to give a more specific date.\n\n\nCities: Skylines 2 had a troubled release on PC last year. Among the complaints against it were performance issues, but the problems went a lot deeper than that. Over time, Colossal Order has been patching issues, recently releasing the “Economy 2.0” update, which overhauls a lot of the game’s systems. There are still problems, and performance isn’t where it should be, but this feels more like how it should have been at launch.\n\n\nAs much as this is a bummer for console players who want to start their urban planning, I feel like the initial growing pains should serve as a warning about releasing games before they’re ready. If anything, it’s heartening to see that Paradox and Colossal Order are delaying things to ensure that they’re where they want it to be. Maybe a lesson has been learned.\n\n\nCities: Skylines 2 is currently available for PC.

The cozy Japanese hit Natsu-Mon: 20th Century Summer Kid is getting an official English translation and release set for August 6, 2024. \n\n\n\n\nThere have been plenty of cozy games that have come out in recent years, but while the Boku no Natsuyasumi series has been around for quite some time, we haven't seen a mainline game make its way over to the west.\n\n\nNatsu-Mon features all the talent behind the summer vacation series too, including director Kaz Ayabe and the team at Millennium Kitchen and Toybox. Yasuhiro Wada, creator of Story of Seasons, also worked on Natsu-Mon.\n\n\n\n\nOriginally released in 2023, Natsu-Mon follows a young boy, the son of a ringmaster of a traveling circus. The circus has come to a small rural town and it is up to you to do whatever you want during your summer visit. The game is completely open-world; you can climb trees, swim in the ocean, catch bugs, go fishing, and more.\n\n\nNatsu-Mon: 20th Century Summer Kid will be out for Nintendo Switch for $39.99 on August 6.

          "description": "Wayforward has revealed that the GBA’s 2005 hidden gem, Sigma Star Saga, is getting ported to modern platforms via Limited Run Games’ proprietary Carbon Engine. On top of that, it will also be getting re-released on GBA.\n\n\nSigma Star Saga is an interesting hybrid of RPG and horizontal shoot-’em-up, which aren’t exactly the most compatible for crossover, but Wayforward was able to make it work. It’s sort of like a normal JRPG, but the random battles are shoot-’em-up sequences.\n\n\nCritics at the time were pretty lukewarm on it. However, over recent years it has found a fanbase in people plumbing the GBA catalog for forgotten gems.\n\n\nI’ll be honest, I’ve played only about 15 minutes of Sigma Star Saga, but my husband was pretty stricken with it. What sticks most in my memory is the vibrant graphics. The original Game Boy Advance had a really difficult-to-see screen. While the GBA SP alleviated it with its front-lit screen, developers developed the technique of using really bright colors to make things more visible. The most notable examples of this are Metroid Fusion and Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance. The style was born out of necessity, but it’s a unique aesthetic that stands out today.\n\n\nWhile details are somewhat scarce, this seems to be planned as a pretty straightforward port. I’ve played a few of the LRG Carbon Engine re-releases lately, and outside of rewind and save states, they tend to be lacking in bells and whistles. It’s mostly just great to see older games get new leases on life. I just really wish that they’d add in control mapping.\n\n\nSigma Star Saga will be released on PC and (unspecified) consoles sometime in 2025. It will also be getting a new physical GBA release via Limited Run Games.\n\nThe post Wayforward is bringing the overlooked GBA title Sigma Star Saga to modern platforms appeared first on Destructoid.",

The next stop for the neo-noir shooter from developer Strange Scaffold is PlayStation 5, which will welcome James Savage with open arms, and most likely in slow motion, sometime this fall.\n\n\nIn addition to a digital launch, physical plans are in store for the PS5 version of El Paso, Elsewhere. The retail release from Nighthawk Interactive will pack the game with a poster and a download code that grants access to a digital version of the original soundtrack. Check out a trailer for the physical version while we wait for a specific date.\n\n\n\n\nEl Paso, Elsewhere has been available on PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S since September 26, 2023. The game puts players in the dual-wielding shoes of James Savage, a vampire hunter who has to battle supernatural enemies and the ever-present skeletons in his own closet. It's got a solid throwback aesthetic that further connects it to its key inspirations, namely the Max Payne series. \n\n\nThe gunplay in El Paso, Elsewhere isn't going to blow everyone away, but its story is something that deserves to be experienced. It's nice that more will be able to do so once Strange Scaffold's dark rumination launches on Sony's console later this year. Beyond that, we still have that film adaptation— which is set to have LaKeith Stanfield in the role of James Savage— to look forward to at some point.\n\nThe post El Paso, Elsewhere heads to PS5 this fall, and gets a physical version appeared first on Destructoid.",

With Dawntrail, there’s a whole new collection of cacti on the scene and one of them looks like he’s been hitting the gym. \n\n\nOf all the minions you can obtain in Final Fantasy XIV, there are some which will drive players to run the same dungeon again, and again, and again. The Tankardtender minion is one of these minions, with a bizarrely cute animation. \n\n\nHow to get the Tankardtender minion in Final Fantasy XIV\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThe Tankardtender minion is a possible drop from one of the level 100 expert dungeons - Tender Valley. \n\n\nThis minion does not seem to have a particularly high drop rate. In order to get mine, I had to run Tender Valley at least ten times (I lost count after that point) and it only appeared once. Thankfully, I was lucky enough to have some good luck on my side and rolled high. \n\n\nYou’ll need to complete the entire dungeon in order to see if you’re lucky enough for the elusive beefy cactus to appear. That means you’ll need to take down the Barreltender, Anthracite, and the Greatest Serpent of Tural. While this dungeon isn’t difficult once you’ve run it a few times, some of the mechanics might take you by surprise. \n\n\nCan you buy the Tankardtender minion in FFXIV?\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nIn short, yes. However, thanks to the fact that it seems to be on the rarer side of dungeon drops, the Tankardtender is currently selling for a high price. \n\n\nOn my home world, the Tankardtender is currently selling for around a million Gil, so you’ll need to line your coffers if you want to buy it outright.\n\nThe post How to get the Tankardtender minion in FFXIV Dawntrail appeared first on Destructoid.",

In the Resident Evil 4 (RE4) VR port, all it takes is lifting the controller in the air at the right time.\nAnd it’s always satisfying.\nThe parry mechanic is one of the novel additions of the 2023 remake developed by Capcom. Whenever a bolt or melee attack from an infected villager is about to impact Leon Kennedy, you only need to press a button to deflect with the in-game knife. This action grants an opportunity to follow up with an attack on the spot while simultaneously adding to RE4’s original close-quarter smackdown.\nAdapting this to the PlayStation VR2 wasn’t easy. Instead of Leon doing a swift animation with just a button press, you need to grab the knife from your chest, lift it up in the air, and match the incoming attack. I…",

In the wake of such a weird cultural moment, I’m certainly not the only one left wondering how the dust settles, especially as it relates to how we meet up, build friendships and relationships, and socialize. If you’re a gamer, answering those questions requires an additional layer of complexity since we spend much of our free time in virtual worlds. I’ve found myself wondering where our favorite hobby fits into the equation.\nFor some years, the “third place” gave a name to a thing that’s been part of our lives forever.

Owners of these games will still be able to play their single-player content, but online support for these titles will end on November 7. The embedded announcement post on X also includes a link to an FAQ to answer additional questions about the sunsetting process. \nhttps://t.co/2W8dLlGjBM\nJune 28, 2024\nWhile the digital PS3/Xbox 360 versions of these games are going away, Battlefield 3 will still be available to purchase on PC. The same is true for Battlefield 4 and Hardline, and these two titles will also remain on sale for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The PC/PS4/Xbox One versions will remain unaffected by today’s updates.\nIt never feels good to see games get removed from sale like this. The reason likely has to do with EA sunsetting online support; it wouldn't be right to continue selling games with popular online modes if that component doesn't work anymore. For those still logging into Battlefield matches on PS3 and 360, you've got a few more months to enjoy the ride.\nFor more on Battlefield, you can learn about how the next entry is shaping up (which is being made with help by Dead Space remake developer Motive Studios) here.",

And it continues to look like a scary new addition to the A Quiet Place movie universe. \nThough there's still no release date – it's launching sometime this year on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC – this story trailer reveals more about the state of the world in The Road Ahead. It seemingly begins on Day One, when the aliens, which possess incredible hearing that requires people to remain silent to survive, attack Earth. It then jumps ahead to Day 105, with Alex, an asthmatic college student trying to survive the end of the world with her boyfriend Martin, on the hunt for supplies and more. \nCheck it out for yourself in the story trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead below: \n\n\nAs you can see, it seems Alex might be pregnant, which, if you've seen the first A Quiet Place movie, can make trying to remain silent in this world quite difficult. We'll have to wait a little longer to find out how the story of A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead plays out because it launches later this year on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. \nFor more about the game, watch the reveal trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead. \nAre you excited for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead?

As for why, the team wants to give its spiritual cousin, Life Is Strange: Double Exposure, some space to shine later this year. \nLost Records was originally due out in late 2024, which is also when the next Life is Strange is set to launch. Instead of competing with Life Is Strange, a series that Don't Nod created with the first Life Is Strange and continued with Life Is Strange 2 before Double Exposure developer Deck Nine took over with 2017's Before the Storm and 2021's True Colors, the studio decided to push to 2025. \nWe've made the decision to move the release dates of Lost Records: Bloom & Rage to early 2025. We know you're all excited for both Lost Records and the new Life is Strange game, and we wanted to ensure both have adequate space to shine. The wait will be worth it! pic.twitter.com/PH1O7z3uUy\nJune 28, 2024\nLife Is Strange: Double Exposure launches October 29, and now, Lost Records: Bloom & Rage, which will be released in two parts, will launch sometime early next year. Both games are set to release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. \nIn the meantime, watch the reveal trailer for Lost Records: Bloom & Rage, and then watch the Life Is Strange: Double Exposure reveal trailer. After that, check out this extended Double Exposure gameplay trailer to learn how the game will acknowledge the first Life Is Strange's endings. \nAre you going to play Life Is Strange: Double Exposure and Lost Records: Bloom & Rage?

Despite my expectations, I was not prepared for how robust it actually is in Veilguard. Robust enough, even, that BioWare used it to create most of the NPCs in the game, save for mainline characters like companions. Setting hyperbole aside, it is a staggeringly rich creation system, and I look forward to seeing player-created near-replicas of celebrities and monstrous creations that'd be more at home in a horror game. \nBut I'm also looking forward to the community's reaction to the Dragon Age series' best character creator yet.

You can read Game Informer's full Concord preview thoughts here, but in short: it feels great and we're excited to play more. \nWe have a lot of questions remaining about the game's progression, seasonal content, narrative emphasis, and more, but if the handful of hours we've played of Concord are any indication, developer Firewalk Studios has, at the very least, created a fun and great-feeling shooter.

Originally slated to launch next month on July 25, the upcoming narrative-driven city-builder is now arriving on September 20.\nDeveloper 11 Bit Studios sates that following a recent beta, the team wants to take extra time addressing feedback to ensure the best possible experience. In a press release, design director Jakub Stokalski and art director Lukasz Juszczyk issued the following statement:\n“Based on the surveys we received after playing Beta, the average rating you gave us was 8 out of 10. We’re super grateful for that! At the same time, it was only a small slice of a work-in-progress, still-growing game. While our backlog is plentiful, it was an opportunity for us to listen to what you enjoyed, and what didn’t quite land yet”. \n“This allowed us to prioritise things better, and bring upfront the features and modifications we were already working on. But we also realised that to guarantee the best possible experience on launch, we need more time to finish the development of Frostpunk 2. That’s why we made the difficult decision to postpone its release to September 20th, 2024”.\n11 Bit States that it plans to work on new additions to existing game mechanics and improve the UI and UX, among other things. \nFrostpunk 2 will launch first for PC on September 20. PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions are planned to arrive later. We recently played the game, and you can read our extensive preview here.",

More specifically, it hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via Steam) on August 1, and it brings with it updated visuals and controls and a new skin that harkens back to the original game's most infamous easter egg. \nIn the reveal trailer, we get a look at the graphical improvements Aspyr has implemented in Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, but the game still retains that 2002 PlayStation 2 and GameCube charm. This re-release follows a limited PlayStation 4 physical run that launched back in 2019. \nCheck out the Star Wars: Bounty Hunter announcement trailer below: \n\n\nIf you're unfamiliar with Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, you play as Jango Fett throughout the story, which itself is a prequel to Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones. \nIn the original game, there was an easter egg message that said, \"Cash in all bounties to play as Boba.\" However, cashing in all bounties did not let you play as Boba. To make good on that original promise from 2002, Aspyr media has included a Boba Fett skin in Star Wars: Bounty Hunters you can use after completing the game's campaign. \nStar Wars: Bounty Hunter hits PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on August 1. \nWhile waiting for its launch, check out this lengthy gameplay demo of Star Wars Outlaws, another mercenary-centric Star Wars game launching this year.

And there's no word on when to expect the remaster either. \nRevealed with a short 47-second teaser trailer, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster looks great, almost more like a remake than a remaster. It's unclear if this is a remaster of the original 2006 game or the HD version of Dead Rising that launched on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC back in 2017.

          "description": "The one and only Elden Ring expansion we're getting, Shadow of the Erdtree, launched last week and thousands of Tarnished went to the shadow realm to take on dozens of new enemies, bosses, and more. Now, just a few days later, developer From Software has released a new patch for the game that should make Shadow of the Erdtree a bit easier. \nNow live, Calibration Update 1.12.2 targets the scaling of the attack and damage negation given to players with each Shadow Realm Blessing upgrade. Here's what's changed: \nThe attack and damage negation has been increased for the first half of the maximum amount of Blessing enhancements, and the second half will now be more gradual. \nThe attack and damage negation granted by the final level of Blessing enhancements has been slightly increased. \n\n\nThis patch should apply automatically like any other Elden Ring update but if it doesn't – the Calibration Version listed at the bottom right reads \"1.12.2\" if it has – select \"LOGIN\" and that will apply the latest version of the game. \nThe only other thing this update contains is word from From Software on a confirmed bug where the raytracing settings of Shadow of the Erdtree are automatically enabled (if you've previously loaded save data from previous game versions), which is causing framerate issues for some players. If you're encountering said issues, check to see if you have raytracing on or off in the game's system graphical settings. \nThis patch arrives after one that hit the game last week, which added new hairtsyles, inventory features, balance adjustments, and more to Elden Ring ahead of Shadow of the Erdtree's launch. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree review, and then check out this interview where From Software's Hidetaka Miyazaki discusses his approach to difficulty in games. \nWhat do you think of this update?

Though you’ll be performing things like light and heavy attacks using the same buttons, what those attacks do varies based on your class.

No, it’s not the key on your keyboard. Rather, it’s a detective story set on a distant planet. Important data has been stolen, and the perpetrator is a shape-shifter laying low in a spaceport dive bar until he can flee off-planet. You play a hard-boiled detective who has the skill to psychically visit bar patrons’ memories to gather clues and narrow down suspects.\nThis is thanks to the kind people at ZOOM Platform, who provided us with the original game sources to work with. Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game features a lot of options to chat around with bar patrons’ and do various actions in the different flashbacks. So we really need people to spend time experimenting and make sure everything works correctly. And please take some screenshots along the way.\nIf you don’t own The Space Bar, you can try one of the free demos or purchase it digitally from the ZOOM Platform. Testing is also available on Steam via a beta branch, check the Steam announcement for more details.\nNow, good luck, and fingers crossed you can find the perp. Otherwise, your bureau chief will have you getting up close and personal with toilet duties for the rest of your career. Oh, and PS: The viewpoints of different aliens differ. For the Bartender, who has segmented eyes, even the original developers felt it was difficult and left in a cheat key of ScrollLock to switch back to a single viewpoint. Feel free to use it if, at any point, the flashback becomes too much for you :)\n>",
